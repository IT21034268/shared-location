5,Excellent.,Such talent.. A punk Icon such as Greg can lay down wonderful Americana sound w/ punk lyrical content.I suggest everyone ignore the previous comments by kids who want a Bad religion album.. Well it isn't. Its better.Some of us 42 yr old punks are all growd up now.......
1,Garbage,For the past two years I was using .095 line. I figured I'd try this as a step up and it would last me much longer. I went through more of this than I did the .095. Sent it back after one try and obviously went back to the .095. Very disappointed!
5,Michael Franti best work!,"This CD is amazing; there is not one bad track on this album. These songs are powerful poetry of peace, tolerance and love combined with a fun and funky reggae/hip-hop beat. Power to the peaceful."
1,It's alright if you don't like personality in your bathroom,"I received this shower curtain as a gift. I think it was meant to be a joke, but I needed to change my shower curtain anyway, so I used it. After a few people commented on how silly the shower curtain was, I took it down. It felt really cheap anyway - it's polyester, not cotton. It's basically just black letters on a curtain - not a great shower curtain design and makes for a really boring bathroom. I'm not some shower curtain fanatic, but I just felt like this was really boring. I'd take some color over black and white any day."
1,Bent after 1 use!,I bought this for my 6' 203lb muscly husband and it bent into a half moon shape on our first trip out!
5,Very Nice!!,I bought this for my mom for Christmas along with 2 Sets of dishes. The extra plates always come in handy
5,ICI Natural Tea Tree Shampoo,"Very impressed with this wonderfully fragrenced, great sudsing, super cleansing shampoo!With daily shampooing this has solved my dandruff problem in less than a week.Plus, my preteen daughter is using it too and it really takes care of her extra oily hair -- and no complaints about difficulty rinsing.When I ordered, I did think the price was expensive for one small bottle of shampoo - but - to my surprise - two bottles arrived in the order (this quantity was not mentioned in the item description). So, considering how great it works, it is definatly worth its price."
1,What is with the swastika?,"What is with the hidden swastikas in the pictures? This book would be wonderful for children. Why put such a horrid symbol in a child's book?? It was a very silly and cruel thing for the author to do, and it ruin an otherwise beautiful and fascinating book."
1,"¿CREEN EN EL? (Una estrella, po que no'puedo menos)","Comprendo la necesidad de que nos ""doren la píldora"", actualmente mucha gente se ha hecho rica escribiendo libros como este. Bueno. Hay lectores para todo tipo. El Sr. Sánchez les dá lo que quieren oir (o leer). Mejor vean una telenovela mexicana(o venezolana), tienen más sustancia...."
5,Surprisingly nice set,"Given the price, I was prepared to be very lenient on this set of items - so I was very pleased when they came in sturdily manufactured, real wood with a nice rich finish (that's not too red), and a very pleasing satin surface(I'm not a high-gloss fan.... too many little fingerprints to show!). Great overall value. I've been buying a few items of furniture after a recent move, and this set was definitely a highlight (in fact, I'm happier with these than the ""formal"" set I literally paid twice as much for... these little ""cheapies"" are much nicer!)"
5,My Sons New Favorite Toy!!!,"When i got this in the mail, i surprised my 2 1/2 year old son when he was taking his nap... i layed the dragon next to him and he woke up and said ""wow, mama"" and now he carries it everywhere.. he likes to put his buzz lightyear on the dragon, and pushes the dragon all over the place..well i would say this is a very neat plush dragon. very beautiful... i think the price is a little expensive.. i was actually thinking it was a little bigger before i bought it.. but other than that i can tell this dragon is going to be with my son for a very long time.. :)"
4,Melissa + Doug Dragon Plush,This is actually quite large and well done for a stuffed toy. Lots of detail and my granddaughter will love that it is very colorful! Great purchase.
5,Colorful Dragon,"I ordered this dragon for my Art class room. My theme is dragons. This thing is so cute! The colors are amazing and the size is bigger than my two year old, who by the way, saw it and just feel in love with it. This dragon is absolutely perfect from my room. Can't wait for the kids to see it!"
5,OMG! Perfectly Adorable!,"Exactly as described only better! Colorful, soft, well constructed with safe, padded supports within the wings and legs of the dragon...built to last. Big enough for a toddler to ride, roll and tumble with."
1,Not worth the money.,"The product I received was nothing like the picture. Granted, it's a big plush, but the colors weren't as vibrant and the ears fold down instead of up as the picture shows. Not worth the money."
5,Puff the Magic Dragon,"Dragon arrived in one day and it is a very colorful, large, wonderful plush dragon. The little boy who received it fell in love with it immediately and will probably own it for years!"
5,My dogs love it,They have never been healthier since switching to this dog food. They are energetic and playful and their coats are shiny.
1,Very disappointing artwork compared to FMA and FMAB,"There are some great action scenes, but the story is jumbled and the artwork is shockingly poor. What's most unforgivable is that the faces of Ed, Al, Mustang, Hawkeye, etc. are not only drawn different, they're rougher and uglier. The backgrounds feature some beautiful artwork, but the human faces and forms are terrible, a real step back from FMAB. You will not enjoy this addition to the franchise if you loved the artwork of the manga, FMA and FMAB. What were they thinking! Watch it and weigh in for yourself. But this is not a movie I'll be treasuring, and I'll pretend it never existed. Shamballa was really beautifully drawn in comparison (remember the Victorian Ed?)."
3,Just brings up too many questions,"To start things off I love both series Fullmetal Alchemist and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. *This may contain spoilers* This is a movie that is canon with the second series yet if I'm not mistaken it opens up way too many questions. If I recall right at the end of the series they go off to both the eastern country and the western country for the first time, yet in this movie they are in the western country of Creta and it is set within the second series. This kind of sets up a paradox if I'm not mistaken which is one of the reasons for my lower review the other being the new art direction. Don't get me wrong by the end of the film it was an ok look it just took me a bit to get use to after I had been use to the animation in the series. To sum up if you like the series you should like this film there may just be a few things that may irritate you however."
2,Worlds greatest railroad a set of 5 DVDs,"I bought this product thinking it would be all about scenic journeys by some well known railroads across the world. However me and my family members were disgusted to find that most of these videos are either interviews by some travelers, the pantry staff in the train and so on. A lot of commentary. 4 DVDs out of 5 are all about people talking about their experiences....and very little scenic videos..very boring indeed.This is not for people who want to see greats trains passing through some beautiful scenic places.The only good part is the 5th DVD which has covered Model railroad projects across the world. Only this one DVD out of 5 is interesting and informative for railroad modelers.Overall i would rate this product as FAIR.Shailesh Karkhanis"
4,Ripening talent,"It's as full of genius, wackiness, and over-indulgence as any of Stevie Wonder's albums. Get it for the greatness - return to it for the laughs."
4,WAIT A MINUTE!!,"The old man on ""I Wanna Talk to You"" wasn't Nipsey Russell!? I am shocked! I am appalled! I am SHOPALLED!!!Anyway, I love this old album. Paid a grip to get it imported, but it was worth every penny. ""Talk to You"" is a clunker, like ""Sweet Little Thing"" on MomM, but everything else is great. Way too short!"
3,Too small for an IPad,"I purchased this to keep my IPad, passport, ect. safely locked up, and am very disappointed to find that the PacSafe 100 is too small for the IPad. Other wise it is a well made product."
4,Who knew the dragon was the good guy,"This is a great example of Holt's writing and a great example of the drier British humour. Though a few jokes may be lost to readers not yet familiar with Kurt Lundqvist this book still reads great on its own. If you can find this book and you like Holt pick it up, even if you have to go to the UK site to find it like had to."
2,Too basic for a serious reading of the subject,"A very basic/introductory look at terrorism. I had to read this for a graduate level course - nothing new or revealing. This book is more appropriate for a novice with no knowledge of, and just a passing interest in, the subject. I agree with some of the other critiques, this writing is based more on opinion, with some historical facts, than a serious study of extremism and terrorist organizations. A big part of the turmoil in the Middle East is brought about by the Israel/Palestinian issue - unless this is settled, terrorism will persist in one form or another for generations. Netanyahu does not do an adequate job of addressing this subject from a neutral perspective. In short, he is not a disinterested or neutral observer - he obviously has an agenda. The reader must keep this in mind when reading. Not recommended."
5,Buy this book,"The journal of Scott Pendleton Collins by Walter Dean Myers is the best action book I have ever read. This book talks about a young soldiers life.In 1944, Scott was in the army. Scott was 17 years old when he was in the army. Scott had a friend named Bobby Joe. Scott was promoted sergeant. Then Scott was hurt in war.I like the detail that was given in the story. I especially like the descriptions in each part of the story. I like how the author adds feeling to the story.The author describes how each soldier tries their best to defeat all of the Germans. I figured the theme was don't give up and try your best. That is why I persuade you to buy this book!"
1,Inappropriate material,"Inappropriate material for children.Includes multiple uses of the Lord's name irreverently, multiple mentions of girls being ""easy"", references to male genitalia, etc."
5,the best book I've ever read,I loved this book alot.Its my favorite book yet I've never read a Dean Myers book this book is about scott who gets a journal for his going away party than he gos to war and fights for freedom and hes in history if u like war books and history you'll absoulty love this book.I will say 1 more thing this book is so good i might even buy even though I've already read it i want to read it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,The journal of Scott P Collins,"The main charater is ScotT P Collins.He is a ninteen year old boy who is eager to go fight the Germans in Eroupe.Ithought this book was good but it does take patience to read.It starts out very slow.The book takes on the outskiris of the front line during the Americans part of Operation Over Lord [D-Day] .The main conflict in this book is the Germans invasion of Poland,France,Russia and north Africa.The authers style of writing is journal entries each chapter is a new entriy.This book is part of a large series of books called the Dear America.My recommendation for tis book is for some one with a lot of time on his or her hands.This book is historical fiction so it tought me a lot about World War Two."
5,Works as expected,"So far all of the DVDs I have recorded using this media work. I bought these because they have a good reputation for quality and longevity and did not want to spend the extra money for archival quality DVDs--of course, I can't comment on their longevity quite yet--we'll see in about another 20-25 years!"
5,Best DVD Media Available - poor shipping,Have used several cake boxes of Taiyo Yuden DVD media and have as yet to encounter one bad disc. Quality is the best - price very VERY reasonable.Please note - every cake box of Taiyo Yuden DVD discs that I have ordered has been poorly packaged. Lucky for me.... no damaged DVD disc yet. The law of averages predicts that sooner or later I will probably receive a package where many of the discs will be damaged because they were poorly protected/packaged.This lack of common-sense packaging on the part of the shipper does not detract from the fact that he Taiyo Yuden DVD discs are the BEST.
4,fake?,"my shipment of JDMR-ZZ-SB8 arrived without the Taiyo Yuden Authentic Top Paper Cover, which leads me to believe they could be fakes. media ID comes up as TYG02, but that can be faked as well. cake box was not secure in package, the cover popped off, and I nearly wound up with a box full off loose dvd's.If authentic, and better packaged, easily a five star purchase at the 27.50 price point."
4,I don't like it but my kids do.,"I own this and my kids love them. They have memorized the songs now, plus I use it as a way to give me a break while I'm cooking or something."
4,the pages fall out,The content of the book is excellent. The information and exercises are valuable. The binding is horrible though: within minutes the pages started to fall out...I'm docking it a star because of this.
1,"I'm a fan of EFC, but was sorely disappointed","I'm afraid that this novel was very painful reading. The plot flowed slowly, (which would have been okay, if it had only been more substantial,). The dialogue was wooden. The old characters, (e.g. Doors and Da'an,) were written fairly well, but the new ones, such as Jubal and Esther were very poorly portrayed. (With the one exception of Lekren, a Taelon.) Half of the book was spent in Jubal's flashback which, although it revealed necessary information, could have been far shorter than it was.Buy the paperback if you are a fan of EFC, (since it's the first novel - you know you have to have it, even if it is muck *g*). If you're not, avoid at all costs."
3,"OK, Mystery sf","""Night Sky Mine"" is an OK sf, mystery novel, but not MelissaScott's best work. The story is written from the perspective of a girl-child (Ista Kelly), and a gay, couple of auxiliary, policemen. In the mystery, they converge on solving the disappearence of ore-mining ships in a neighboring asteroid belt.Scott is a master (mistress?) of creating societies on the edge. ""Trouble, and Her Friends"" is a good example of edgy, sf wound-up in a cyberpunk future. The scenery and the culture layed-out in ""Night Sky Mine"" were similarly excellent.However, in ""Night Sky Mine"" the author tries to mix the cyberpunk with the space opera. Like oil and water, they didn't mix well. In particular, the changes in point of view were not well handled. I found them confusing rather then compelling. I could never distinguish between either of the two gay cops. In addition, I found the tech to be just a little corney.""Night Sky Mine"" is OK sf, but pass if up if there is something else on the shelf."
5,SciFI at it's best,"Melissa Scott has a habit of writing novels that are well put together and thick with possibility and meaning. Skilled in presenting conflict and resolutions that seem human in a future universe, this novel presents a solar system with; asteroid mining, computer programs that evolve, a strangely abandoned asteroid and child, that comes together in a well crafted mystery that asks some of the eternal questions about the meaning of humanity, and the interaction of self and society."
3,"Good, lite reading","Using his personal experiences and shaped by his religious background, Mr. Prager provides useful recommendations on pursuing the activities and pursuits which define happiness. Ironically, it is much easier to read about such things, than actually pursing them. This isn't an academic study, quotes no research or studies, merely reports his insights, which are often, well, insightful. The book is marketed for a mass audience (not a criticism), is not ""explosive,"" or intellectually challenging, (unless you're intellectually challenged), but is in general, a Reader's Digest kind of reading."
4,Simplicity can be profound. A must read about happiness.,"I rarely read self-help books. Happiness is A Serious Problem was on my sister's bookself and I was finished with my novel. Prager's philosophy was so powerful to me that I took notes as I was reading to remember the critically important messages to incorporate into my daily life. I'm a clinical psychologist and I've not only recommending it to my patients, I've recommended it to my therapist!"
3,Not so merry,"This bundle of movies stretches the imagination to consider them ""Christmas"" movies. I suppose they might qualify as ""Holiday"" material, but, on a scale of 10, I think I'd have to give them a 6.5. There's better out there."
4,"Expensive, but works on hungry deer!",I wish I didn't have to buy and apply this stuff but it does work. It also works well for several weeks even with rain. The problem is that the flowers grow and the new shoots are obviously not protected until you spray them. Keeps even our VERY aggressive deer away when it's on the plants. Very smelly when you first apply it but fine after drying overnight. Close the windows and stay inside when you first put it on! Very expensive else would give 5 stars.
2,Snowshoes?,"I wasn't pleased with the quailty of these shoes, they seemed cheap and considering how often i would use them decided to send them back"
4,"new meaning to ""sisterhood""","A book about strong women in a region where everyone was self sufficient. However, this book gives new meaning to ""sisterhood"" because the story is from an era that pre-dates the feminist movement. As the years pass and the outside world infiltrates this remote village, the women are beginning to articulate their needs, fears, pleasures and strengths. Lippi makes the reader wish for the ability to truly ""go home again""."
5,By an original and deftly talented novelist,"My Paris by Gail Scott is a work of literary fiction about a Canadian woman's time in a Parisian studio. Examining cultural legacy entrenched against the onslaught of globalized mass-media, and written in a staccato style that relies upon long strings of sentence fragments - complete subject-verb sentences are disdained for the power of emotional abbreviations of thought and form - My Paris is memorable and distinguished work, marking Gail Scott as an original and deftly talented novelist."
4,Beyond plot,"My Paris is the scantest trace of a plotline. Its nothing you are going to lose yourself in, but a book - like Woolf's Orlando - that forces you to pause, consider, and backpedal after each passage. Conceptually, the book begins with the syntax where the present-progressive verb tense complicates time while blurring the distinction between subject and predicate. All in all, the book describes Paris and all that influences a character's impression of it."
4,Purchased for an Odyssey PC925 battery,"As the title indicates the terminals were bought for an Odyssey PC925 under the assumption the battery did not come with the terminals. The battery actually came with the same terminals in the shipping box so these were redundant. Long story short - check the battery product description carefully or contact the seller to determine if they include the terminals. It'll save you the return shipping.Overall, the terminals are very high quality."
1,Get Bored Fast,"This is basically a poorly stitched together compliation of press releases, so it doesn't really warrant a long review.Next to no insights. Skip it."
3,history + business tactics != success,"Frankly, Spector's set-up of narrating a chapter's worth of amazon.com history and then telling the reader what s/he should learn from that chapter irritates and insults me as a reader. Also, there are numerous editing errors, such as ending the second paragraph with a comma! This book seems to have been rushed to press; perhaps it could use a second look by all those involved in its publication."
4,Excellent for beginners,"Amazon.com was my first book about e-commerce & the new economy. In that sense, it can be considered as a very good starter for anyone who wants to get involved in the internet world. Regarding the related mystery by the author about Jeff's personality & the circumstances in which he started his company, my opinion is that all start up stories are mixed with as much mystery as Jeff's.Zouhair M'barek29/09/2000"
4,Entertaining Regency,"Regency romance has always been one of my favorite genres, and ""The Miser of Mayfair"" doesn't disappoint. Familiar with Beaton's mystery series, I knew the writing would be good. Light, clean romance, with storylines involving servants that I look forward to continuing through this series."
5,All About Genius,"Alberto Iglesias, an axiomatic genius, hypnotizes and fulfills with a collection of stirringly haunting, lovely songs that swirl in Spanish and classical.This disc is wonderful and has amazed not just me but all my friends. If you buy only one soundtrack in your life, this one's the safest choice."
4,good bread,"""Bob's Red Mill Gluten-free home made wonderful bread mix"" is well named and will bake an excellent loaf of bread. Enjoy it."
1,"OMG, horrible","this is the worst bread I have ever eaten. I followed the directions, and the bread is very gritty because of the bean flour. I used 1 bag, plan on using the rest for something else. blech."
3,"Not to my taste, but nice loaf","I baked this in myZojirushi BB-CEC20 Home Bakery Supreme 2-Pound-Loaf Breadmaker, Black. It baked up beautifully. It was light and moist, but I just don't care for the bean-y taste."
3,First time EVER!,"Well, recently diagnosed as a 'celiac' so the journey is on. We have never baked a loaf of bread in our life. We're not pro's like you folks but you have given us some great ideas. Tonight is our 'maiden voyage' with the white loaf. We tried the whole grain dark loaf last week. It didn't rise but just a little. We threw some craisins in there and it added a nice tart yet mildly sweet flavor.But, the white is brimming with height as I type. We don't have a bread machine (yet)...my question is...does the GF varieties bake better with the machines? Thanks for all your great ideas. We're off to GF land..."
1,Yeast not good.,"I regularly buy Bob's Red Mill Wonderful Bread Mix in my local store as I love how easy it is to use. I wanted to try buying it in bulk to save money. The first loaf I tried didn't raise properly but I thought perhaps I had not heated the milk sufficiently when preparing. I was more cautious with the second loaf but had the same results. Now, preparing a third loaf, I have had to use my own yeast to get it to work properly. Be cautious when buying this product and check for proper yeast proofing before adding to the mix. Maybe this was just a bad batch but I will definitely be looking for another Gluten Free bread mix to use."
2,A lot to be desired,"Three major issues with this bread:1. This bread had an off taste - not quite ""beany"" as another reviewer noted, but more like eggs or egg whites. Almost a French toast aftertaste.2. Although it rose, the top sunk when cooling. The loaf looked like a volcanic crater and made for misshapen slices.3. It was not as hard as the frozen gluten free breads found in the store, but it certainly crumbled as badly making it useless as a sandwich bread - maybe good for croutons (except for the taste).I found that theThe Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)bread mix to be a lot better. It was moist, did not crumble, had a great taste, and made a normal looking loaf. I'm new on the celiac diet and will try Pamela's next, but Bob's was put out for the birds to eat."
2,GREAT texture - weird taste.,"We've tried a few gluten free bread mixes and so far Pamela's Products is in the clear lead. This bread has a great texture, it slices nice and thin and holds up. It has a nice ""chew"" to it and it is moist with a great crust. It came with its own yeast and if you use a bread mixer - it bakes up in a breeze. Its just to bad the taste is ""off"" kind of ""beany"" maybe? My daughter, who we make the bread for, has this to say about it: ""It tastes just blaaaah. Its tasteless and it has a rubber after taste."" We wont buy this again."
4,Good for Bread Machine,"I make a loaf of this bread mix in my bread machine at least once a week for my son who is on the GF/CF diet. He had no hesitation in eating this bread and it allows him to continue having PB&J sandwiches. My daughter who is not on the diet happily eats it with her brother at lunchtime so I don't have to worry about the kids sharing. She has access to wheat bread and never complains about eating this bread. My husband also likes the bread. I find it to have a little of a ""beany"" taste by itself, but have enjoyed it as a base for stuffing and breadcrumbs. It's easy to make in a bread machine and requires only milk (I use almond), eggs, oil, and cider vinegar--all staples at my house. It's easy, almost fail-proof, and with Amazon subscription, the most cost-effective MIX I've found."
3,Better than not shampooing,This product did okay. It is not as good as a regular shampoo. If you are unable to use sink or shower go ahead.
1,Not so good,"After buying the Extremley Ripped 1000 video, which I love, I was excited to try the Jari's latest.I was very dissapointed. This video seems to play on fast forward. The whole video is just done at super speed and looks and sounds crazy. The dance portion is good but not much of a cardio workout. I also don't think we need a repeat of the warmup (which is strange and too fast) in every section. It is redundant and makes it so you can't just work your way thru the entire workout. I hope she makes a new one on the same platform of the 1000. It is a great workout."
2,Piece of junk,"First off you have to drill into the top rail of your pool, inviting rust.Secondly, the breakawayfeature of the net won't support it's own weight and breaks away. I had to duct tape it to even work.Even then it kept falling down. I got frustrated and threw it out.Now I have 10 holes in my pool I have to fix before it rusts out."
1,Do NOT purchase! Not worth the box it was shipped in!,"This is a TERRIBLE product. Cheap plastic that won't hold the net if it is even slightly bumped. There doesn't seem to be any mid-grade water volleyball products for above ground pools. You either get the cheap, unusable stuff for $50 or pay $300 for a custom-designed one. Really?"
5,A must have for the Mariposa historian,"Perlot probably spent a night at my property, still known as Spencers Millsite. Owned by Bunnell and Spencer whom he makes reference to in the book.Some of his references need field research, they are so detailed, perhaps one may locate his old cabin sites and trails from them. A fine piece of very readable writing, filled with fantastic details."
2,Tube Smoked and Died in Under 3 Years of Light Use,"Thu unit failed into its third year. It suddenly smoked and died, without warning. The unit was put in service for light duty only, mainly for reheating already prepared foods. On sum, its cost averaged about $45 per year of service. Considering the other product reviews of this item together with my own experience, it is apparent that Panasonic ""knows something"" when it backs this unit with only a ""one year limited warranty"", and this should tell you something, too. If you want dependability and longevity, then this product is not for you.Also, because of the potential electrical fire hazard, the operation of this and all electrical units should be attended and supervised by a capable, responsible, alert and attentive adult."
3,Won't turn on unless it is bumped...,"Purchased this timer for our pool pump to replace a newly purchased GE timer that would work some of the time and some of the time it wouldn't. Spent many hours troubleshooting the GE timer and finally gave up and decided to buy the Intermatic T101R. Now I find that the T101R won't turn on unless the box is tapped. So now every morning somebody must go out and tap the box with their foot for the timer to turn on. Timer turns off all by itself but won't turn on. I like all other aspects about the timer. Just wish it would turn on like it is supposed to without somebody having to jog it back to life. I haven't had time to dig into the inner workings of the unit to see if something can be done about this problem. From reading another reveiw it seems there is a problem with the ""ON"" pawl."
4,"This stuff is THICK, be prepared!","Not bad, not a miracle trim line by no means, but better than the normal 0.95 stuff or the .115 even. If your an older person, I do not recommend however as it is VERY stiff and tough to load up your spool. Trims better though than the everyday crap, but it does break off also. We have centiped grass here in Ga. and it's a bugger to any string even this stuff!. It is heavy though and causes your trimmer engine to run at lower RPM, so be prepared to keep it idled up some or it will stall it out for you. Does cut your trim time though on REGULAR grass for sure."
3,It's OK,Did exactly what the purchase was required to do. There was no surprises on this item. Fit right in and did the job that was required. Line is too thick to work with my weed whacker.
4,Garage Heater,Not a bad heater for it's size! I'm heating a 24'X24' insulated garage that I use as a shop. Used to heat with wood until the Insurance company caught up to me during a routine evaluation of property. So I took the small woodstove out and installed the heater.All set up from the factory just ran the required wire by code and flipped the switch.Puts plenty of heat out for my purposesOnly con is I dont see the switch buttons lasting long. But replacement in Baclight are available.
3,"not the best, but okay",This game is okay! Madden 2000 is way better though. In madden 98 you can pick one of twenty eight football teams and pass and run until you get a touchdown and beat your opponent.
3,Too Broad,"There is interesting information here for folks that want an overview of the Indian Wars period, but not a lot of detail if you, like me, need detailed historical information. It's easier to read than ""Frontier Regulars"" by the same author but not as detailed."
4,Some of the finest live Crim,"I think this period in the band's evolution has produced some of its best live material and improvisations. This album captures a time when the quartet of Wetton, Fripp, Cross and Bruford had their synergy at its peak. Best ""Night Watch"" version I have heard live from all the other performances I've listened to."
4,Drill Doctor is almost perfect,"The Drill doctor is great for drill bits in the medium range. Small drill bits are very difficult to align in the alignment mechanism. Large drill bits are a bit much for the motor and it bogs down. You just have to go a little slow.Overall, I'm quite pleased with it!"
1,It's the SOUND stupid!,"I've never really felt compelled to write a review. Most are written by fans who naturally give 4-5 stars to the recording. Well, I wanted to at least have the Temps very greatest so I ordered this cd. I fired up my McIntosh amp and exotic Austrian speakers and got ready to hear the best. I was astounded to hear the exact same sound that came out of the 3-inch in-dash factory-installed speaker that came with my 1967 Mustang!! Mono and absolutely NO effort from the label to remaster and give these songs the sound-quality they so rightly deserved. What a disappointment!"
2,Outdated,2nd edition - Outdated. The payment industry is changing and it is not just a US invention. Japan is on the edge of electronic money through your cell phone.Be aware that this is an overview and a dated one. And you won't be dissappointed.
1,Numerous subtle errors,"As an experienced programmer I found this book to be riddled with numerous technical errors. The errors are subtle but can mislead a beginning programmer very easily.A few glaring examples are the book implies (and a diagram shows) that http traffic is routed through DNS servers, claims that html tags require attributes when they do not, and skipping important concepts like named anchors with in a document. The book also makes claims about browser behavior that is not correct. (Browsers can't handled x-??? mime types without the server providing a program via some magical unnamed system)It appears as if the author of the book has only the most cursory knowledge of what he is writing about. It would be understandable if only the sections on the various server programming languages was written this way but instead the entire book is."
4,"Great songs, but CD could have been better","A absolutly love every song on this CD. From the ifectiously catch ""Magic to Do"" to the tender, yet not muzak, ballads like ""With You,"" this CD is a delight and a must have for every musical fan. Unfortuantly, Mowtown needs to repackage the CD with a plot synopsis at the least. The songs are much easier to appreciate when you know what is going on when you hear them. I promise it will become one of your all time favorites."
4,Great Book!,"This book is really good, because it presents a lesson that a normal teenage girl experiences. True parts of the book were a bit cliche, but this book is highly original because of how DeVillers thought out Jamie's world.Not only did she come up with the main characters, she showed us TV hosts, movie stars, singers, celebrity teens, and models! She really thought out the people Jamie would idol.The only downside to this was how flat some of the characters were in their personalities. But seriously, its a great book and people will want to read it!My one concern is the movie. High School Musical was a giant success, but I just have to hope they don't destroy this movie. Past movies of Disney Channel have been almost embarrasing. I can only pray Read It and Weep will turn out like High School Musical.Oh yeah, one more thing about the movie. WHAT HAPPENED TO JAMIE'S SISTER?? Jamie now has a BROTHER. *grr* But the guys playing Marco Vega and Connor Kennedy are CUTE!!!!!Read this book!"

Beginning with an introduction to the Business Coach's 6 Steps to Massive Results, The Business Coach guides readers through the process of establishing their business, making a consistent profit, and eventually turning the business into a ""well-oiled machine.""Do yourself a favour and read this book - it'll be the best business decision you'll make this year."
3,Business Coach high on promises,"This was a good overview of the same principles ""work on your business, not in your business"". It was clear but really lacked the specifics needed to fully implement a program into one's own business. I felt it was a long sales process for his coaching program."
5,Brad's books have fundamentally changed the way I run my businesses...,"I've started, built, or sold 6 small businesses over the years including one business that sold for $1 million and an 800% return on invested capital.I've read all of Brad books and they rank right up there with the likes of Michael Gerber, Robert Kyosaki, and all the rest.In this book Brad shows how to move your business from the Mastery level of chaos, through the Niche level by creating awesome cash flow, through the Leverage and Team levels where you build infrastructure into your business and then through Synergy and Results where you can work in your business recreationally and sell it for big money.Forget the nay-sayers...I've patterned my businesses after the ideas in Brad's books and they've changed my life.Enjoy!"
1,The Biggest Scam Ever!!,"I purchased two of the series because its high ratings. Then when I went back and read the review again, I found an very interesting pattern. That is, all the reviewers who give 4's or 5's to the series are the same people. What is more, when you see their review history, you will find that they only have reviews for the series only. What a coincidence!I am not implying the author or his company fake the rating. I am just pointing out the fact for yourself to decide. And I think amazon should definitively take action to investigate this kind of activities. I lose faith in amazon's rating system because of this incident.A disappointed book lover"
1,"Not worth buying, borrow from the library","The book is an easy read, but there's no substance, a few good points but nothing else."
2,Patricia,"This was a very pretty ring, but after getting it wet we realized that it is only glued into the setting, and so we lost the stone. I felt very bad since I had given it to my daughter for her birthday. She really loved it. I caution others not to get it wet or to shop more carefully!"
3,it looks cute but some part are damage,"it looks pretty cute when i open it. but when i look clearly through it, there are some damages. scratches, band, etc. even that, i still would like to order it again for size 6. overall, it's a great gift to any females. im pretty sure they'd love it."
5,Delivers as advertised...,"Far too often I have picked up a self-help book and either set it down unread because it was pure drudgery - - or I read it to conclusion to learn that it failed to deliver the self-help mechanics that I was looking for. This book delivered. It was a quick and entertaining read and provided straightforward techniques for dealing with tough questions in a debate, a business presentation or public Q&A.; Author uses many political debate anecdotes yet they are all powerful in illustrating his concepts. I was left with an excellent understanding of his recommended mechanics in dealing with tough questions. I felt that the book delivered. The chapters included:1) The Critical Dynamics of Q&A;2) Effective Management Implemented3) You're Not Listening4) Active Listening (Concentration)5) Re-Take the Floor (Self-Defense)6) Provide the Answer (Balance)7) Topspin in Action (Agility)8) Preparation (Discipline)9) The Art of War (Self-Control; Agility vs. Force)"
1,"Fuzzy photos, no battery life, don't waste your money!","I have actually returned this camera to the company four times for replacements and the replacements are never any better than the ones that preceeded them. The battery life is dismal, the pictures are fuzzy. This is just a cheaply made camera. Save your money!"
2,polyurethane changing pad,"The mattress pad for this product is made from polyurethane, which is not eco-friendly at all. If the eco-friendly tag is important to you (and that was the only reason I was willing to pay $250 for a padded tray), then this might be useful for you to know. I suppose you could buy it and then buy something an eco-friendly diaper pad, but for the price, I think that's a lot of extra. I returned this (great return service!) and ended up with a naturepedic pad, alone, without the wood. . ."
3,crumbly,"I use a lot of Dr. H products, but a good portion of these chicken treats contents crumble to dust -- kinda messy. The tripe ones hold together much better. (But my dog loves them all!)"
4,Good quick reference,"A good quick reference book, but I will say that some words are not listed. It is focused for 2nd - 5th grade in my opinion. A handy addition for a home reference library!"
4,I like it!,This product is unique in a sense that there is a zipper liner to protect ur mac book from scratches.It looks Sporty and compact . It will be even better if the side pocket is bigger.
5,Dreamrunning your way through life,"This book is an easy read that allows us to then to face life facts with instant solutions! For example, change is inevitable and increased so we must seek ways to deal with this inevitability. The author points out that for starters, we must detach ourselves from the outcome; that is, be happy doing as opposed to only when you are done. When you enter the present, you expand time; Kant also espoused this as the author points out. Stop expecting. Let events in life flow through you; all we can control is our response. Identify with your life force, your Spirit; we must develop new ways of knowing and being.This book is written by a runner who continues to run and who seeks to realize his human potential and is happier because of this. (Hence the subtitle A Dreamrunner's Guide) The author provides some specific tips in particular mindsets for running; I'm more of a sprinter myself but this book makes me think I can also haul the longer distance!"
2,A little to philosophical for me.,"This was hard to read. Maybe I am not used to such books as these. When I purchased it, I thought I was getting some ways on how to combat stress. I think some of the theories in this book can lessen stress. However the author tries to relate how running and running in life can be alike if the reader goes with the flow and eases his/her mind to the situations in life. The theories are a little hard to relate to real life experiences.Perhaps I have misread this book. However, I found very little which I can practice in real life from this book. It may be great to view Ballard's theories as how to live one's life, but it would take some time to understand his thinking."
1,Jams very easily!!,"I didn't have a lot of issues initially, but after a while things started jamming inside the laminator. I currently have something stuck in there that I can not for the life of me get out!!! There is no way to take the machine apart, the company is no help, the rollers stick, there is no manual way to reverse and get items out...it's just plain...STUCK."
3,Decent action flick with some ok humor,"3.4 starsSeems like every other movie these days is a comic book remake (are there that few good scripts floating around?). In the comic book vein, The Losers is a pretty good effort. Morgan is fun, if no great actor, the rest are entertaining, and the action is fast and plentiful.It's light in tone yet very violent, and the violence is so endless that it gets rather tiring after a while. Jason Patric made me laugh as the villain a number of times, and along with Evans adds most of the fun here. Saldana didn't do it for me; she was far more annoying than sexy, a nightmare in many ways. Maybe that's just me. And hey, it's just a comic book, I mean movie, so who cares.If you need to see a lot of bad guys get shot and a lot of stuff get blown up, The Losers will do it for you."
4,The Winners,"""The Losers"" is a perfect example of a studio mishandling the marketing of a good movie. I have a vague recollection of it coming out in the spring prior to the impending heavily promoted summer blockbusters. I told a good friend of mine about it who is a big action afficienado and he had no recall of it at all. I didn't go into it with high expectations thinking it would be nothing more than a series of CGI and explosions that passes itself off as action. To my surprise ""The Losers"" had a gripping story at it's core directed at a breakneck pace to keep your attention throughout. The characters were full-bodied and not caricatures despite the film's comic book origins. The ending portends to a possible sequel but word has to get out about this genuine sleeper in order for that to happen."
3,Losers is a not a Winner but Not a Loser,The Losers was a pretty good movie.A little predictable but acted fairly well and the casting was pretty good.Not a waste to rent on a Friday Night.
3,Lost in Loserville,"Too many movies try so hard to something they are not.....ENTERTAINING! Yeah, it's a weak plot but who cares...it's mindless fun. I call this movie the poor man's A-Team! Great for just pure escape-ism, a few cheap laughs, and GAWD awful acting....at times! Pass the popcorn please!"
1,"Product is fine, just think the movie is boring","The Losers was my friend's favorite movie, but I just thought it was a typical action movie meant for guys. Basically a male version of a chick-flick."
3,The Losers On Blu Ray!!!!!!,I really like this film. but the films that have some problems like the ending which I won't talk about for the people who haven't seen it. But for a good action film and a action film with Zoe Saldana who been in lots of geek films like star trek and avatar and she said that from herself that she is a geek. the only person who I hated in the film and lots people hated him is Max well the guy playing Max is Jason Patric is was really bad. Jeffery Dean Morgan was descent as Clay and Chris Evans is funny as hell Idris Elba is getting better with his America voice and this is a DC Comic series by Andy Diggle and this guy named Jock and this guys are British as well as Idris Elbra and the losers is a good action film until the end so check it out.
2,An average boxing game.,"Definetely an average boxing game. Graphics are okay, but nothing spectacular. Gameplay is reasonably good, but nothing we haven't seen before. At a bargin price, it might be worth buying. However, it is squarely in the middle of a crowded pack, and is also dated."
2,Bumper sticker ethics,It took longer than expected. The book was in better condition than i thought it would be but i waited a while before i actually received it. I am not happy with the service at all.
3,Excellent case--with caveats,"Love this case-- bought two of them! But... the holes for the pen are off, so you have to cut them out, very carefully, with a razor blade, or otherwise have to take the case off every time you want the pen.For those who may say theirs was fine--the company first told me they were all off, then told me that some were more off than others and they'd find a better one if I ordered. I ordered a second one and it was worse than the first. Since the company by then knew of the issue, you'd think they could resolve it.Too bad. You'd think the one who designed it would have actually checked to see if it worked, because other than the pen's hole, the case is excellent--better than another Galaxy Note case I bought that cost twice the price.So--I highly recommend this nicely designed, well thought out case--but be prepared to alter it with an Exacto knife (not difficult, but awkward; don't cut too far or the case is useless; just take a sliver off the left side)."
3,PRETTY GOOD SUSPENSE,"I only gave it three stars because I'm really into horror flicks, but a good suspense will do. Be careful who you marry cause you may have to live with them - this girl was COLD, man!!"
5,"Sixth Grade Glommers, Norks, and Me","""One day `till 6th grade and Tam is afraid of looking like a nork,"" Allie Kimball writes in her diary the day before her and her best friend Tam, are heading off to middle school. They are both excited, but Allie doesn't know what lies ahead of her.When Allie and Tam first start middle school, things go smoothly until they have their only class together, science. Allie is appalled when she spots Tam sitting with Renée. Renée has been Allie and Tam's arch enemy since 3rd grade!When Allie gets seated in the back of the room with her new science partner, Orren the nork, she becomes jealous of Renée, and grows to dislike Orren.But before long, Orren is a lot different than Allie expected, and she gains a new friend in him. Middle school is not quite what she expected, but great all the same."
5,Makes a great cup of coffee!,"I am very happy with this coffee machine. It brews 8 cups quickly, and the coffee is great! Have had this machine for well over a month now and and it is great value for the price."
3,Good percolator with cheap plastic top,"For the money, this percolator could at least have a top (clear spout) that isn't made out of plastic. I paid $60 for this percolator and within 9 months the clear, plastic spout was broken (disintegrated from the heat). I don't leave the percolator on longer than 30 minutes. The part from West Bend is $1.99 with shipping of $7.99 plus tax. Why does it cost $7.99 to ship such a small part? I am disappointed with the quality of this West Bend item."
1,Awful!,"It works great, but on the inside bottom of the pot the material has started to chip away. It must not be stainless. I now have to order a new pot. Different brand."
3,"A simple, paper dive log","The dive log is 60 pages, and made of reasonable thickness stock but doesn't have a finish that would protect it from water or moisture. Each page contains simple dive information but there is a good sized section for notes."
5,Incredible Voice!,"I just heard Greg Wood's ""I Can't Hold On"" and was thoroughly impressed. Wow, what an incredible voice! The song is very clever and in tune with today's pop sound. I am looking forward to hearing more music by Greg Wood. I am certain that he's an up and coming star!"
5,99% Of All Sales Are Made Based On Good Fundamentals,This book opens with a great story about how the author meets this basketball coach and asks him for his biggest secret to winning games. The coach goes in and shoots the most basic and fundamental shot in basketball - the easy layup. And says -- see that shot --- 99% of games are won on that shot. Don't ever miss it!That story perfectly sets the stage for what this book is about. You find yourself using the Sales Bible as a great reminder about the fundamentals of sales.A solid addition to your sales library.
2,"Some good ideas, but repeated and repeated and repeated","Some good ideas to get you think about approaching sales with your own style. I agree with a previous reviewer that the book seems to be a collection of previous articles that he thinks he taylored for the book, but the ideas get very repetitive. ""Listen, communicate, power questions, follow-up, etc"" are stressed in almost every chapter.Chances are I would not buy anything from him (I borrowed this book from a friend); he seemed too much of the full-of-himself salesman that is untrustworthy and that you can hear and smell a mile away. And ironically, his selling techniques given in the book violate the list of characteristics of the New Breed of Salesman he describes in chapter 10."
4,Heresy or Religion?,"Are you new in the field of sales? Then read on!This book provides you with almost anything on sales except for the latest technology tricks. Selling a product isn't easy and if you're inexperienced selling is even harder because you're probably insecure. That's why you need books like this.Being new in the field of sales myself when I read this book five years ago, this book gave me a head start. Motivational and inspirational writing is being combined with common sense and it really makes you act. Several ideas can be implemented at once when a new or existing customer rings you on the phone, that's great about this book.You don't like to be a salesman? Then at least pick up 'Integrity Selling' by Ron Willingham (available through my reviews). For all you out there who can't wait to start selling, buy this book!"
2,This is in no way what I was expecting to get. Disapointed.,"After reading other reviews, I thought I was getting something ""New"" something that would ""close more deals"" something that is ""a must have for all sales professionals."" It is none of the above. There are areas that are touched on which are common knowledge in todays sales world. Basic and without and creative function. Over all boring. Leave this one on the shelf."
3,"Another ""Also Ran"" Band","I was rather disappointed with this CD. After reading the other reviews I expected the best unheard band from the 70s. Unfortunately, some bands deserve to be unheard, or at least not overhyped. Most of these songs are pretty generic and hookless, sounding like a tamer version of the Ramones or (on the later songs) some New Wave act like the Vapours (who were not so hot themselves). ""Tired of Waking Up Tired"" is still one of my favorite power pop tunes of all time, and their version of ""Red Rubber Ball"" is actually better than the original by the Cyrcle, but unfortunately the rest of these songs are not at all comparable to those two. Who knows? Live these guys were probably great, but the recordings are just average to below average."
5,"In the 70s, you could count on three things...","1) No road rage of any kind because evvyone drove a hooptie.2) A drug dealer in the 'hood was more like Huggy Bear, not Pacino in ""Scarface"".3) Evvything Rick James would put out was bound to be funky and soulful....Relive the 70s with this original from Slick Rick James."
5,RICK JAMES FOREVER,"Come Get It and Bustin' Out of L-Seven are both masterpieces. The musical arrangements are phenomenal, the songs are loooong and funky as hell, the lyrics are priceless and Rick exudes confidence. Rick's early stuff is undoubtedly his best. I've listened to Rick James for 20 years and I never tire of these two titles."
5,Great price on a well made hopper.,"This hopper was the cheapest one available when I bought it. Despite it being so cheap, it is a great design, well made, and perfect for what we needed it for."
5,Introduction to self-examination and expansion of the soul,"Daily Bread: Seven Days To A Healthier Soul by Robert Meade (Kairos Team, Loyola School, New York City) is a powerfully written and deeply reverent of one man's personal spiritual journey, and its implications to leading a more fulfilled, enlightened, and faithful life in accordance with the wisdom of God. This ""reader friendly"", 63-page treatise offers a brief yet profound introduction to self-examination and expansion of the soul, as well as offering questions to reflect and ponder upon at the close of each chapter. Daily Bread is recommended for students of sanctity with a Christian context, as well as the conditions and circumstances of the human experience with the spiritual realities of contemporary everyday life."
5,Fun book for the kids,"This book is really fun for entertaining kids , its so much fun , its very clear and easy for little ones"
2,Not sure about this book,"I am unsure about this book as far as it's authenticity is concerned. The combat descriptions ring true, but much else has the 'wiff' of exageration and self serving recollection. There are too many extraordinary events and coincidences to swallow.Perhaps memory distorts events too much, or the American ghost writter has mangled the translation - but I found the book to lack credibility.For a better read - I'd recommend 'Forgotten Soldier' by Guy Sager."
2,No business value,I learned more on wpf from Microsoft Expression blend tutorials on weblogs than i did in this book.It will tell you a lot about1)Layout (manual layout in code/xaml)2)Graphics (manual graphics in code/xaml)It will NOT tell you about1) dynamic data binding2) how to create an app start to finish using expression and all of the tools available to you for wpf3) how to validate data4) how to use the navigation service and pages5) how to use page functions6) how to use property bagsAnd those are just the road blocks i've run into so far and had to research on my own. This book really let me down by not giving me even the slightest hint into the tools i would need to finish a business project!
2,Out of Date & VERY bad index,"If you like using the index in the back of your reference books then this is NOT the book for you. It is shameful how HORRIBLE the index is.It was also written before framework 3.5 came out. So, it's pretty out of date.I bought this book based on all of the good reviews. But in the course of developing while learning WPF, I went to Google instead of this book 9 times out of 10 whenever I had a problem."
4,best next-to-a-miner's-light,"I don't spend my shift working in a mine, but I do need light that is bright, easy to use and resistant to conditions of moisture and dust. The cord from the battery pack could be a bit more supple, but otherwise this is an excellent daily or occasional-use product."
1,poor quality - would not recommend,This product is poorly made and I would not recommend to anyone. The motor overheats frequently and the unit will not run for several hours. The threaded fittings for the water supply side of the pressure washer are made of plastic and leak.
4,They work for my cat,"I didn't give this 5 stars as I've only had it a couple of weeks maybe. But even though they are big my 7 lb girl goes for the whole thing to bite it although 1/2 goes on the floor but she cleans that up. She is a 2 year old I just got 2 months ago and the vet said her teeth had plague build up so I'm hoping these help, she's not the type to let me brush her teeth, although I have wanted to buy those dental wipes to use along with these. My girl has a small mouth and she handles these so I think if the cat likes them enough they will bite through to get the benefit. Ultimately it would be better if they were a little smaller, and I also give her some greenies so I hope it helps."
5,good for cat's teeth,"My cat loves these and the bonus is they are good for cleaning his teeth, the vet noticed a difference. He gets them about twice a day as a treat."
1,Don't waste your money.,"If you are a serious bible student, you'll be disappointed that this doesn't begin to cover the words in The Message. There are no Strong's numbers. If you want to do serious bible study, try a different bible version."
1,Do not order unless you intend to use within a month!,I ordered these in bulk. I was trying to avoid paying shipping by ordering for the future. Now I am stuck with 8 boxes that expire in a month. I contacted the company and they gave a really long excuse as to why they are not responsible for this and will not replace them. These pods do not work as a replacement for senseo coffee pods and they did not work in my espresso maker either. I have to open the pod and empty it into a coffee filter in order to use it. The coffee does taste really good though.
4,"Great pencil, poor eraser.","This really is a great pencil. However, the eraser leaves a lot to be desired. I can't find a good pencil with a good eraser ever since they started making latex free erasers. Overall, this is the best cheaper pencil around."
1,"""Kill Me""","I'm sorry but if you consider this a classic of the 80's you do not have taste. This movie is so unoriginal and boring. It's schizophrenic and not in a good way. It can't decide what genre it wants to be. And that ""Catch Phrase"" everybody quotes and loves is the worst of any movie made in the 80's. If I had to watch this again I would say ""Kill Me"" instead of "" Thrill Me""."
2,Lola73,It's okay but didn't come with cd I thought because it was new it came with it so got little disappointed cant get a hold of sender to ask sucks
4,Powerful Unit,"We personally own 2 of these units. It amazes us every time we turn them on how much water they draw out of the air! It is like other dehumidifiers, in that is it not very quiet, but it works great! It makes us feel so much better to know all that moisture it collects is not sitting around creating mold in our furniture, clothes, walls, floors, etc!"
2,boring and lacks pictures,"The photos from this book are not compelling, the patterns accurate but unattractive, and the book as a whole is just not very interesting."
3,Way too short to be a cd,"Most of the songs on here are good, but there's only 9 of them! But I have to admit it's much better than that crappy 1999 Grammy Rap Nominees album!"
5,Cream of the Wolf's Crop,"If you are only going to buy one protean blues collection by a 300 pound semi-literate sharecropper, this should be the one. Wolf's pre-Chicago glories are fully on display here - all killer and no filler! There are a few of these ""Memphis days"" collections floating around but this one is possibly the finest."
4,Keeps you Guessing,Interesting character development and has feeling of suspense and full of surprises as you wonder who the bad guy is.
2,ehh...,"I didn't finish the whole book, so maybe I'm biased, but I didn't think that this book was worth reading. There was a repetitious feel to the characters, as if they would all be predictably similar. I just didn't buy that law enforcement personnel would be so squeamish."
2,deadly misfire,I found myself very interested in the very beginning but somewhere along the way I lost interest. Maybe it was me? I can't say it was a bad book but found myself speed reading and wandering when it would end. I didn't have a problem with the GOD stuff like others complained about and didnt think there was all that much God talk in it. I did find It was pretty easy to figure out the who dunnit and why.Even at the bargain basement price of zero dollars I found this one to not be a deadly aim but more like a near miss.
2,Not very entertaining,"I really wanted to like this book, but from the start felt that I was walking through mud while trying to get through the Tolstoy-esque use of proper names. A pronoun or two never hurt anyone. It wasn't just that the book lagged, but that I could see what was going to happen from the third chapter. Others liked it though, so if it's still free see what you think."
4,deadly,"My heart skip a beat to every suspenseful action scene! It has never a dull moment, up to the last chapter. Will probably read the next book!"
3,attacking media overload,The book reminded me of a P. Cornwall book--too many things go wrong with the hounds of media attacking at every oppertunity. Gets a little unbelieveable.
4,Very good,"I am on a roll in terms of buying books by new authors. This was another example of a well-told story,with sharp characterizations and a well-balanced plot. I would recommend this book to others."
5,Good Book,This book was very enjoyable to read. I definitely recommend it for those who love mysteries! It had a great plot.
4,Deadly Aim (Angel Delandy Mystery Book #1,"I really liked the character, Angel Delaney, in this book. I'd like to read more of this series. I will recmmed this to friends."
2,A bit predictable,"If Amazon wants to promote literarure with a Christian message it should alert readers. Yet another free book that proseltizes. No problem with religion per se, I just like to know what I am getting into. Really good writers don't need to be heavy-handed with their message"
3,deadly aim,i still haven't finished the book yet have been to busy playing the games .I always have trouble reading with out getting tired the book is interresting i just don't read that much but i thought i would give it a try
1,adult dvd???,"we could have saved the money for this dvd, because my 4 year old son stood up in the middle, explains, that it is for adults and never wants to see it again. Scence with old boats and fog frightend him.(Friends told me simalar storys about other thomas dvds.)"
2,Salty's Secret Not As Good As Other Thomas Videos,"Salty's Secret is shorter than most Thomas videos, a mere 34 minutes. Most children's videos are about 45 minutes long. It has promos in front, too. Alec Baldwin is not as good at narrating as George Carlin. My son loves our other Thomas videos, but he seemed a bit bored by this one. Thomas videos with toys are [inexpensive] at Walmart, so it's a bit pricey."
5,Smart Cool Big New,"This piece is only my second acquaintance with Gordon's music, after the title track on Bang on a Can's excellent album, Industry--another tune about dissolution, I suppose, and one of the best tracks on that disc. To describe the musical language of Decasia, I might ask you to imagine Penderecki's noisiest stuff--or Stockhausen's Helicopter string quartet--crossed with a hardcore instrumental groove from an unpretentious rock band, by way of the late minimalists. It's pretty unrelenting for the whole 67-minute length, but the climax is tremendous, well worth the investment of time and energy. I was struck, listening to the piece for the first time, by the feeling that I was hearing something completely new and, somehow, very important."
3,Controls,"The temp control is on the side and the on/off switch is on top. Both locations are in the way of the user who is handling the curing iron. The on/off switch is VERY easy to press during usage so you frequently end up turning the unit off. The heat control is also in a BAD location on the side, right where the thumb is positioned for styling the hair."
3,Over rated?,"Other reviews for the Medi-Dyne CoreStretch Exerciser have been glowing. I'm happy for these owners, but I am not as enthused. The device will help to stretch the back and shoulders, even the hamstrings, but after the first few basic recommended stretches, it is mostly a matter of repetition even though the instruction sheet illustrates different ""advanced"" stretches. For this reason I think it is very overpriced; hence my mediocre rating. If the device were $30.00 rather than $60.00, I'd rate it somewhat higher."
5,very simple excellent effect,i really impressed the idea is very very simple and brilliant it really works and works hard too very effective stretch specially the legs. really good job
2,"for Bikini guys, Not POWERLIFTERS",The deadlift is not even listed in the index. The title of this book fooled me. Its not for powerlifters. Powerlifting is not even mentioned in the index.
3,"Should be ""Serious Bodybuilding""","I was dissapointed. The book did a good job of explaining the principles of periodization, but that was about it. All the knowledge could easily be condensed into half as many pages. Not really a bad book, but I thought it would be more advanced than it was. If you buy it, remember that the weight reccomendations for the example routines are just that: reccomendations. It is more important that you adhere to the number of repetitions."
3,Gets the job done,"My cat doesn't hate the taste of this toothpaste. In fact I think he might actually like it if I wasn't jamming a foreign object in his mouth while he tasted it. The finger cap is totally useless. It's huge and impossible to use on a cat. The brush is the perfect size for a tiny feline mouth, however the bristles are way too stiff. I'm lucky enough to have a cat that won't struggle/fight during his brushing so I can be a little more gentle than if I was trying to juggle holding him down and brushing his teeth at the same time.Construction of the product is high quality, kitty will be having his teeth brushed for quite some time with this one."
1,Not what I thought it would be,"I bought this hoping to get a decent refrence on firewalls, so far I have opened it 8 or 9 times to review a topic and find that in every case there is a knock of Microsoft products or stellar talk on linux, this and the fact that the authors listed are MCSE, I thought this would be different. I am very disapointed to have spent money on this just to have this tired argument thrown at me yet again. The book may have some nice content, I have yet to find much because I get pretty disgusted when the 1st things written are always a view point on this issue, if I wanted more of this crap I can get that from a blog for free, and frankly it is growing old."
3,The exercises are not very good,"I used this book in a first year graduate course. I found the exposition not very clear, and the exercises particularly uninteresting. If you have the choice, I definitely recommend Gamelin'sComplex Analysisinstead."
4,Intelligent New Age,"Finally, intelligent new age music. You can tell Trine has a background in classical music as his music has a point of view & not simply mindless drivel. I'm usually not a fan of new age but the composer & I have a connection with his classical career & I was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed this CD as much as I did."
5,Works,I spent a week in the wild with this thing. I typically have a bottle of water next to it and just pour it in before using it. It works well. Just use a painters mask when you empty it!
2,Europe : 1815-1914,"Gordan Craig does an excellent job of breaking down of the European picture from the fall of Napoleon to the outbreak of World War I. What impresses me the most is his breakdown of the 1848 Revolutions and the the rivalry between Prussia and Austria for domination of the German States. I know that there is much more in this book, and its good, but the rivalry between the ""Big Germans"" and ""Little Germans"" is broken down, in my opinion, awesomely by Craig. ANYONE who is a student/teacher/buff of this period MUST have this book."
5,No car should be without it,"Buy one for every member of your family. This book is full of practical advise, maps, usefull phone numbers... the list goes on and on... and it fits in your glove box."
5,Quick Read. Excellent Advice.,"""Climbing the Corporate Ladder..."" is a practical guide to career success. Extremely well-written. Inspires lots of ""ah-ha"" moments. Helps young and seasoned professionals remember to find a better work and life balance. Encourages readers to consider success from all angles. I loved it!"
1,all Fuji media is problematic,Thought my Sony camcorder was broken but it turned out to be the Fuji tapes. Had the same experience with my DVR on my computer. Once we switched media we were fine. DO NOT BUY FUJI MEDIA
2,will fall apart!,"They appeared nice on the website. They were smaller than I thought, and not durable. Pieces fell or snapped off as I pulled them out of the box they were delivered in. Not sturdy...any hamper should be designed to withstand normal wear and tear given that it's used daily. Cheaply made. They'll be in pieces before too long."
4,Informative book,Great book on how to sharpen whatever. I wish there were more on sharpening the various types of knives tho. Otherwise--OK.
3,"read ""innumeracy"" instead","I found this book disappointing. While some of the examples and anecdotes are interesting, and everything is very well written, I didn't really understand what the author's point actually was. I suggest that your time is better spent reading his other book, ""Innumeracy"", which is staggeringly good."
2,I'm returning it...,"Device looks nice, but the sound is of poor quality. My son hated it. I gave it two stars because it looks nice at least."
5,Gets to the heart of success,"The interviews in this book are wonderful. I have read many books on ""how to"" be successful, but Mike probes deeper, and finds out what really makes these people tick. What he comes up with is a much more intimate look at successful people, how they think, not only in business, but in their everyday lives. I absolutely fell in love with Wally Amos of chocolate chip cookie fame. His attitude towards life, problems, solutions, and success is absolutely inspirational and uplifting. Thanks for a great book, Mike and Jason!!"
3,Some good points.,"The book certainly has some good points to it, but one thing that puts me off is that the book sometimes seems like one big sales promotion for their web sites and mailing lists. It's a little irritating that at the end of every page they ask you to visit their web site and they keep pushing their ""special offers"" whenever they can. My take is that Mike Litman (who I think is around 28 years old) is applying a lot of the marketing and sales techniques mentioned in the book to funnel traffic between his various projects and to make money for himself. I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with that but it's just a little bit of a hard sell. People buy a book for it's content if we enjoy your work we will seek you out ourselves!! What goes around comes around..."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"This book is a great read. Truly motivational - it will get you pumped up to do whatever you are striving to succeed at. There are a few business points and you can get a lot of ideas but it is more like a ""Why Not"" book than a ""How To"" book.Basically transcripts from the radio show that Mike Litman did over the years,the passion is palpable. That is what you will walk away with, new passion for your life.Danielle Millar, Glenn Simon Inc."
2,Heavy on the Feminism,"The facts in this book seem complete and accurate. We learn that Annie Oakley did not deliberately lose a shooting match to Frank Butler as she did in ""Annie Get Your Gun,"" a product of the unfeminist fifties.The information on the trials of Oakley's early life was especially interesting. I felt the book bogged down when the author began trying to fit Oakley into a feminist straitjacket, relating everything she did and didn't do to its connection with women's rights. I also grew tired of hearing how sweet, feminine, and ladylike Oakley was."
3,Ok as a player,"I bought this when my old Cannon 8mm gave out so I could transfer all the videos to DVD. This it does fine. If you are buying this to actually use it as a camera look out, the LCD panel is useless outside. The black and white CRT viewfinder works but not all that well."
3,a little disappointed...,"I just received this book yesterday and in the few songs that I played, I noticed spelling/lyrical errors. I always understood ""Wind Beneath my Wings"" to say ""a beautiful face without a name...for so long...a beautiful smile to hide the pain"", but in this book, the lyrics are ""only a face without a name, I never once heard you complain""...???? If this is another version, I would rather have the well-known version. And I never knew Jewel's ""You Were Meant For Me"" said ""I've got my eggs and my pancacks, too"". I like the song selection..."
5,Most imaginative SF I have ever read.,"This book deals in part with 'what is a human being', are we the stored experiences of a person ?In this world, some people not only store their experinces to be re-born into a new body when they die, but can let their conciousness drift into a virtual world in the AI network that allows for very abstract experiences. Some people can even launch copies of themselves into the network to work in parralell (bit like unix child processes but personal!). As they go deeper into the network they think quicker but in an increasingly abstract world. Strange stuff indeed !"
1,Painful to read...unpleasant to view,"Quite frankly, made me feel literally (boom boom) ill. The phonetic sequences are impossible to read, and I ended up skipping them. Usually love the author, so very very disappointed. I think Banks publisher/editor has become far too indulgent, ""Oh yes, Iain, I LOVE it...No, I know you can't read it, but everything else you've written sold..."" I think the Emperor needs to be told he is naked."
3,Loved it,I have read three of the four books. They get better and better. I am on to the last book. Happy reading
2,Mediocre at best,"I have to admit I expected more imagination out of a cover album from unknowns, who might do some really interesting things with the Pixies good stuff. I'm not sure I consider this a ""tribute"". There are a couple good tracks, but largely the album falls short in my book."
3,It's okay but it's a little boring,I played the SNES version of this game and since it had Spider-Man and the X-MEN I thought it would be great. It's okay but it was stupid. Spidey's moves were limeted and can only shoot webs.Woverine and the Cycolps levels were good but the rest was hard.If you want a Spidey game from the same system I suggest Maximum Carnage or Seperation Anxiety
5,A true eye opener!,I am an independent voter that keeps an open mind about most proposed policies that are talked about by politicians and private citizens. This book is a true master piece that compiles data from many economists and government agencies to illustrate the incredible burden of our current tax system. The proposed flat tax would invigorate the economy and give everyone a massive tax cut while actually increasing the revenue of the government. This is a must read for anyone that cares about this country and its growth.
1,Did others see the same movie I did?,"This had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. With two really good actors you'd think there would be some redeeming value; however, I waited and waited, and there was none! Sad waste of their talent and my time."
1,What a stupid movie,"I would have hunted the guy to the death too. And wtf is with the ending?!?!? At least take your gun and knife because you'll need them. Also how is Liem Neson walking so well, HE IS SHOT!!!! Don""t waist you time."
3,"Ok, if not for God's name in vain","I watched this because someone wrote that it had PG language. Well it might, since Hollywierd does not consider the use of God's name in vain as cussing anymore. For those of you who care this has multiple GD's and a JC with a few other choice words thrown in. I would give this about 2.5 stars and if the language was gone about 3.5"
4,Intelligent but accessible,"Any film with an opening half hour as great as this may inevitably seem like a let down when it draws to a close. Still, this is the best new Western in years. Liam's accent is a little off, but Pierce delivers an outstanding, almost animalistic performance. This should have been a hit."
4,Bang bang you're dead meets Cold Mountain,"Revenge for his family drives a man to go after another man regardless the consequences. But at the end you are almost waiting for them to kiss and get married, I liked this movie except for how it ended. By the way I have nothing against two men kissing, thou I am not gay, but these two were not made for each other..."
3,"Loses steam in second half, but still a good modern western","I watched this modern western as a double-bill with Stagecoach. Started out really great, but lost steam about halfway through. Pierce Brosnan goes a great job, as does his counterpart Liam Neeson. I love the fact that for the first half of the movie, you don't even know why Neeson is chasing after Brosnan and wants to kill him. 4 stars for the first half, 2.5 stars for the second half, 3-stars overall."
1,Not my idea of a good western,"This movie sounded interesting, and I am a fan of both actors...but for me...I suffered all the way through this bleak film that I thought would never end. The constant flash-backs just seemed to drag it on and on. I just wanted this movie to stop."
2,"Good actors, bad movie",i'm a western fan but this was a long tedious adventure in boredom. if you are trying for sleep this movie might help.
4,Not your ordinary western,"Beautiful scenery. Filmed in New Mexico and Oregon. Once the plot is revealed, the story falls into place. Too much gore for me though."
5,The only guide you'll need.,"Dan Levine and his crew have experienced what they write about.It's based on reality,not on puffery. Savvy,irreverent at times, funny and wonderfully practical.It's extremely well organized and easy to use. I've read a ton of stuff on Vegas and this is the only one I actually use and give to others. Their opinions are the same as mine.My only criticism is the binding. It tends to fall apart after many uses. Dan, would you consider spiral binding?Thanks, Dan. Samuel Henderson"
1,Jeff King LOVES this DVD,"Jeff King,a guy I know from work,LOVES this Movie,especially the MotherF----- cursing.If you want to see the worst film ever made,pick up this DVD"
1,Bottom of the barrel garbage!,"This movie proves if you have an old raggedy bulky camcorder, a mixer, some keyboards, special effects, and some sorry excuses for actors/actresses that you can make a stupid crappy homemade horror film! The self-proclaimed Zodiac keeps calling the police station and antagonizing the cop and calling him ""Fat f*ck"" after everything he says. To keep a long story short, take my word and save your time, money, and your eyesight. Do us all a favor and discontinue this one! If you want to see a real film about the Zodiac, watch either ""Zodiac"" or ""The Zodiac"". At least in those 2 films they cover events as they happened in real life."
1,This one was really bad,"Ulli Lommel's string of serial killer movies started off promising with ""Zodiac Killer"", then went quickly downhill with ""Green River Killer"" and ""BTK Killer"". ""Curse of the Zodiac"" is just as bad as ""BTK Killer"". There's not really any plot, just a series of murders and 70 minutes of extremely tedious filler scenes. With ""Zodiac Killer"", which had a decent story, I could overlook the obvious low budget, but this movie has no redeeming features, and what's with all the strange camera angels and the bad editing? Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
1,Zodiac or a gimmick to the Zodiac,"When I first seen this movie on the shelf at the local Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video I was thinking Zodiac movie that might help piece together the mystery of the serial killer. After watching this I was like, 'what the hell was that all about? that's not the Zodiac it's some gimmick pretending to cash in on a big thing from the 60s & 70s'. I don't know how this movie even got greenlighted, cause the Zodiac seemed to be like a juvenile teenager and not a man like portrayed in documentaries or other movies based on the Zodiac Killer. I give this movie 1 star out of 5."
5,Can't Go Back,"We tried this rice and liked it a lot, but didn't realize how good it really is until it was gone and we cooked a batch of organic basmati rice from the food coop. The Rice Select rice has wonderful taste and firm texture. The local rice that we cooked tonight was mushy and tasted terrible. I tried a bite and didn't eat any more. I've been spoiled and will have to be sure to always order in time so we never run out again."
5,Amazing Album!,This is a great collection of Abstract Rude's unreleased gems and collabos. Highly recommended for any fan of great music!
1,Don't waste your time,"This is an aweful book and a waste of the paper it is printed on. The few pages that it has is duplicated for tear out sheets, and it has only 3 games in it. It is not the Best and I regret spending my money on it."
1,Not Happy with after sales service from RCA,I was able to play only 1 DVD and then it stopped. When I returned for replacement I haven't received DVD yet and the contineous answer is 'Not in Stock'. When I will get replacement ? Answer is 'Don't know' !!Very hard to trust ...if customer returns the unit late then they charge you late fee but if it is late from manufacturer then there is no refund for buyer !! its a part of game.
1,Don't buy this item,"After 6 months of working fine, it started freezing and melting. After another 6 months of talking to customer service reps and following all of their suggestions, it now no longer even recognizes DVDs."
4,Great!,"I brought this (a gift) for my husband and he really likes it. I just wish it had an idigo lite for night viewing. Overall, a very nice watch to own and wear."
3,Not too exciting,"The book had little juicy content of what it is like to climb Rainier. If you've already climbed it and are looking for more challenging routes, that this is your book. If you are a first time climber, this book will probably fall short of your expectations."
2,crispy fruit,"This les Baxter is allright, however I'm disappointed to discover that a gammophone is used for making this cd.Amazon: please inform customers about this kind of practise in future.Sound quality is a bit poor. One can here needles an the high rank female voices at the end of the album sound crispy."
3,Not real satisfied,"The box was crushed, had sharp plastic shards from the casings falling out and 2 of the discs are defective and I was unable to watch. Other than that, the product arrived quickly as promised."
5,Great value pack for a great show!,House is definitely one of the best shows around at the moment! Don't hesitate to buy it: it's so much fun. Plus there are quite a few bonus materials available on the DVDs.
2,even Michael Cera fans won't love this,"A sweet romantic comedy about following their music tastes to fall in love. It's truly a playlist and the soundtrack often underscores and exceeds the story, taking over the film in quite a few places. The film is cutsey at times and entirely gross at others, without reason to be either. There's one running joke that's filthy disgusting and boggles the mind of any audience member as to why it was included in this teenybopper film."
3,Sweet and gross.,"Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist is a somewhat innocent romantic comedy. There are some funny scenes in this film but if you not a fan of seeing bodily functions, then this coming-of-age tale is not for you. Michael Cera (Juno) and Kat Dennings (The House Bunny) have adorable chemistry, you truly believe their affection for each other. I like how this movie takes place in one specific day but like I said, there are some scenes that go a little overboard. It's a mixed bag for me but I highly recommend the soundtrack!"
4,Okay,"This movie was okay. I mean it wasn't poorly done, I just expected a little more out of it. It was a romantic/comedy with one funny part I liked. Decent movie though, Wouldn't highly recommend it."
1,PAINFULLY BAD,The only thing I can recommend about this film is the soundtrack. Wish they put the same effort into the script that they did in picking the songs. I guess the source (the book) is to blame for this terrible film. URGH!!!
5,Rawr. <3,"This is a really cute movie, and I'm quite happy with my purchase. It was received as described, and on time."
5,love it,cute story and the movie was received within a timely fashion and was in great shape... I am pleased with this purchase.
3,No unlock indicator,"I assumed that all TSA approved locks had a visible indicator to show when the TSA unlocked your bags - this lock doesn't. Granted, the description didn't specify that it so it's not a flaw but FYI."
1,Failed on first trip,I bought this about a month ago. After about two weeks of use (on my very first trip) the lock stopped working. It was almost impossible to open it and now it won't lock anymore.
3,Semi-Hard Sort-of New Wave Science Fiction,"This is a massive and ambitious work. High quality and a lot for the money. I felt somewhat deceived by the title though. Many of the stories seem to define Hard Science Fiction by illustrating an exception to the rules. The editors seem to have gone out of their way to include nontypical examples and surprise us with authors that we didn't expect. H.G.Wells? OK. Rudyard Kipling? I don't think so. J.G.Ballard. Not really. At least, not MY definition. See my list: The Scientist/Engineer/Inventor Hero in Science Fiction"
5,Awsome!!,I gave this to my nice and she loved it. Arrived really fast and it's a pretty neat gift for a 4-6 year old girl.
4,Wooden doll family,"These remind me of toys I might have had as a child. They are a bit crude compared to the slick toys kids have today. They are a bit retro looking. The dolls do bend, but it isn't easy. Arms and legs are just covered wire. The dolls are cloth. If you are giving them to a child who will really play with them, I'm guessing they'll get very dirty. I got them for my granddaughter. I liked the grandparent dolls. My granddaughter is very careful with her toys, so I think these will last and be fine. These would not be for rough-and-tumble kids! Painted faces - no moving eyes! I do think they'll be great for imaginative play."
5,"When drying baby, wrap baby in soft towel. DO NOT place baby in dryer.","This book is hilarious! I can't think of a better gift for someone who is about to have a baby. Sure, you could buy them a Dr. Spock book, a car seat, diapers, or some other equally boring gift, but this ten dollar treat will have them actually remembering who you are! Of course, it also might end your friendship if you are implying in a not-so-subtle manner that you question their parenting skills and believe their baby is in imminent danger. But even if they do never speak to you again, at least you will always be remembered for this wonderful book."
4,"Funny,Cute gift",Funny gift given as a baby shower present. My husband and I have definitely had the diaper changing decision making difficulty LOL
4,"Poor quality, fantastic book","This book is positively hilarious. Unfortunately, the book that said it was ""like new"" had very clearly been handled plenty. It had bent edges and the cardboard was coming apart a little bit in one edge."
5,BEST Baby Shower Gift EVER!,"This is a hysterically ironic book! The images of the ""do's"" and ""don't's"" of baby care are irreverent and comical. It takes a bit of humor to appreciate the book, but most 20- to 30-somethings will find this quite amusing.Makes a great gift for a baby shower where it can be passed around for all the guests to enjoy!"
5,"I bought this as a shower gift,","then read it prior to wrapping, and was not disappointed. I actually laughed out loud (alone in my kitchen) over several pages, which is uncommon. I would recommend this for new parents in particular, provided they have a sense of humor ;)"
5,Hilarious! A Must Read If You Like C. Hiaasen or E. Leonard,"This book made me laugh out loud. The characters and plot twists keep you guessing. If you like Carl Hiaasen or Elmore Leonard, you will love this book. But it's truly original, I've never read anything quite like it. This now tops my list of favorite books!"
3,meh,"I was sorta hoping this was going to look cooler than it actually does.As far as sound reactivity, the audio really drives the visuals well...The visuals are a little too strobey/flashy...we had it on @ a party and decided it was just too annoying. :("
3,Very large cooler,"Before you buy this cooler, measure the place you want to mount it. I got ready to mount itand it wouldn't go through the whole in the front of the truck. It seems pretty well built,but has not mounting tabs. I would prefer exterior mounting tabs to the plastic bolts throughthe radiator."
4,Boogie Woogie,Had to have it for the collection. Gap Band never fails to get the ladies shakin ass on the dance floor. This ones got all the cuts too.
3,I should have read the fine print.,I was disappointed to learn that this rosary of Pope John Paul II is in latin. I was looking for English.
2,Kirigami for beginners,I was not pleasedwith this book and unfortuneatly I bought it in the hopes it would have some intricut items. I would say that it might help the beginner or children with the concept but I was hoping for more. It should be show me this inside before you decide.
4,Very interesting,This is a very interesting introduction to the thought and life of a great mathemetician and sometime philosopher. Hintikka has a clear writing style that helps with some difficult material and has special ability in making complicated math seem not so daunting. An excellent overview of the life of Godel.
2,MAU MAU IS FABRICATION from KIKUYU cultural oath,"War is a science. MAUMAU is propaganda name. Try pronouncing MUMA, An oath that the Gikuyu society took to stay together. Who coined this MAUMAU mumboJambo name? Churchill?"
5,LOVE THIS SCENT!!,Wow! This scent is soooooo amazing! I had a hard time finding it and I am so happy to have found it here.
4,A child could learn this easily!,"Overall this book was very well written, very easy to follow and very helpful."
5,This book could actually solve a problem for you,"On page 229 Mr. Weiner brings up God: ""If you want to make God laugh, goes an old business adage, show Him your plan."" The author's tools will not, of course, eliminate His laugh, but they could help you make the laugh shorter and softer so that your confidence is not destroyed when you hear from Him."
5,Another fabulous Fullan resource,"I have read and used a multitude of works by Michael Fullan in my positions as an educational administrator. This book, focusing on leadership that lasts, is one I will go to again and again."
1,Poor Customer service,"I have not receive this item or the other item i order yet. It has been over a month since i've order these books but to this day have not received them. Extremely disappointed, I had to drop my class because these books did not arrive at all. How do i get a refund of my money???Freddie Jordan"
4,hicok,"A great writer. He uses such simple language to convey unique and thought-provoking ideas. He's a very raw poet, which works well for him. My only dislike is his need to blatantly repeat or reveal what message he wishes to give, as if he needed to sum things up in the end."
2,Disappointing,"The setting for this book - Germany around the turn of the 20th century - and the title promise a fascinating insight into the most dramatic decades in pre-quantum physics. The professional reviews are fulsome in their praise.However, the book is largely a pacifist polemic, which may have influenced the reviewers favorably. Beyond that, most of the author's interest is focused on the quirks and bureaucratic aspects of German academia, and the inevitable disappointments of old age. That part is well done.Unfortunately, there is precious little physics in this book. Virtually none, in fact, and what there is is entirely superficial. That's a shame, and a great opportunity missed.Perhaps the reviewers were also influenced by the pseudo-historical approach. I believe this book is one of the early examples in which historical scientists were woven into a frankly fictional account of what might have happened."
1,"Great music, but cheezy label gives minimal amount of it","Bland is anything but bland, but when you see this label, 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection, run, don't walk, to get away from it. They offer short collections of music. Why not offer longer albums like better labels? 'Cause they are cheezy."
1,Overwritten and pretentious,"I was anxious to read The Physics of Sunset as it was reviewed by one of my favorite authors, Anne Lamott. I was thoroughly disappointed by the book. The characters were impossible to connect with not to mention unbelievable. The plot proved to be common and without resolution."
5,Excellent for Math Gurus and Scardy Cats Alike,"This is an excellent book both educationally and entertainmentally. This book is a great way to teach children (and parents) that math is not as scary as it may seem. This book is now also a feature book on the ever-loved show ""Reading Rainbow."" (One of the best RR episodes I have seen yet!) I love this book and am sure you will to. Also be sure to check out the Stinky Cheese Man (also by the same author)."
3,Math Curse is a curse.,"Math Curse explores math from a different point of view. It encourages the reader to view life as a math problem. Although repetitive, this book makes its reader aware of the day to day applications of math. The graphics were very distracting for the reader. Even though the graphics emphasized the word ""curse"", they were too nightmarish for young children. Because of this, I would not recommend this book for sensitive children. In essence, Math Curse is a nightmare to a reluctant math student."
4,Math Curse,"Math Curse displays an excellent, fun format of how math affects our lives each day. Being an elementary teacher, I found it to be a wonderful tool in my classroom. It is a great way to get children excited about math at the beginning of the school year; or anytime for that matter."
2,NOT her best,"Ihad very high expectations for this book as I started the Viking series with ""The Blue Viking"". The book started out great but then the back and forth, hot and cold banter between Ruby and Thork (the two main characters) had me going in circles and extremly frusterated. Although Hill's time travel romances are (I think ) her best and funniest work this book lacked the usuall humor and fast pace that her readers have come to identiy her with."
5,Not really a toy--collector cards,Great set of cards for anyone who likes Farmall tractors. Nicely made playing cards with fun facts and photos of Farmall tractors. A must for Farmall fans.
4,The All-American Hot Rod,"nice book for a hot rodder/car person, will bring back lots of memories, lots of pictures, who needs to read anyway, good quality,"
3,Madonna's great early work,"This is one of Madonna's concerts from one of her first tours. This was made after the True Blue album. It includes most of her early songs. This concert also include's some of Madonna's songs that she recorded for the film Who's That Girl. There are some low points of this film though. I didn't like how some of the songs were sung in this concert, and some of the costumes were really tacky and really 80's. If you like Madonna's early work than this film is one to see."
3,"Madonna looks great, but show is somewhat repetitive","Madonna looks fab, but this is not the nicely cut and edited type concert footage you see in her Truth or Dare video (which are superb). Her voice isn't the greatest, and really starts to wear thin toward the end. Doesn't have all the props and dance sequences worked out. Just a lot of her dancing randomly as she sing various older tunes. Truth or Dare is much better. Still, if you like her look from the ""True Blue"" days, you'll see lot of that here."
4,I'd give it 4 1/2 stars,"As a really, really, really, really big major fan of Madonna's, I totally enjoyed this movie. However there was some semi boring parts of it. THe dancing is spectacular and i think the singing was pretty good. While this certainly isn't madonna's best tour (Blond Ambition, Girly Show) she delievers an unforgetable performance.A must buy for big Maddy fans like myself."
4,Have only played demo,"There are points about this game that I both liked and disliked.Liked: Really nice graphics, duel weapons useage, bullet time, the creepy/action music score.Disliked: Long load times, having to turn left and right with the mouse (!?), some of the hoakey-sounding narations with the FMV sequences.I ran the demo on a PIII 800 with 128 RAM and a GF2. For the most part the graphics and audio were stable with only one momentary skip.I own another PC with PIII 850, 256 RAM, and an ATI Rage Mobility 128. I have yet to play the demo on this system, but all of my other graphics-intesnive games have played better on this machine than the other.If you are going to buy this game, I would hope you have a system with a semi-decent video card and lots of RAM. (256mb at least)"
5,Two guns up!,"This game is amazing! It's different from any first person shooter game I ever played. And that's what I like about it. The sound and graphics are great. Big levels to wander. And the violence is strong perfet for all you die hard fans. But a nuff about what I think, let me tell you about the plot. The game begins when you enter your house and you notice that your furniture is toppled and torn and your pictures are knoked down. Not to mention your dead wife and kid. Vengeful Max goes to see his only friend at the subway. But as soon as you get there and meet him your friend gets a brain wheggie before you can say ""hi pal"". Now you have the mob and the Feds after you. Cool aint it! Well that pretty much it and the rest you'll have to find out for your self.PS= If you liked this review I'm doing one on Clive Barker's Undying soon. It's a cool game for all you action-science fiction gamers. Be sure to check it out."
3,Great Look.. Needs more story,It has a bold look to it but I thought the characters where not very interesting and had to force myself to finish the game.
5,Max Payne is Sweeet!,"I beat Max Payne in three days.The end is very confusing but easy the second time.I mostly use bullet time because it makes you survive more longer.I can`t promise you youl beat the game in three days but i can promise you will love the game.I hope you enjoy Max Payne,by the way DEATH IS BRUTLE"
1,Shoot-em-up with no incentive,"Okay, the game isn't horribly bad. It ran fine on my computer. No problems with instal or starting or anything like that. Default controls are weird but changeable. My major drawback to this game was what was the point? The graphic novel would have been interesteting if it was something you get at the comic shop. I feel cheated by lack of movies. The novel could have been made into movies and lasted a little longer. It was short. The weapons were cool but the bullet-time, should just have stayed in the Matrix. The graphics were great but for a first-person shooter the game was not all that good. When its in the [price] bin, get it. But other than that save your money."
1,Too Difficult,There should be a very easy setting. The game is much too difficult for me which makes it unplayable.
4,Max Payne,"Max PAyne has been talked about by all major gaming magazines and they all agree it looks amazing. You will be Max Payne, undercover cop with nothing to loose. You are looking the killers of your family. The graphics are amazing. You can blow anything apart even money. But the mOSt important thing the slow-mo. You will be able to jump, duck and shot MAtrix style.The game could definetly be perfect, the A.I is just amazing. The only worry I have is that the slow-mo could be annoying especially multiplayer. CAn they pull it off? I sure hope so."
5,"My husband ""LOVES"" it!","I got this game for my hubby for Christmas along with the Playstation 2 system. He absolutley loves it! It shows a lot of blood etc..the graphics are unreal, I guess that's why he likes it so much. I haven't gotten that much attention since Dec 2oo1. =)"
2,Just Pop in German,Seems to be all just pop music in German.Buy it only if you like that sort of thing.
1,Major Disappointment,"I'm really not one to write reviews, but I paid 24 usd for this item and it was very weak. The earlier stuff they did was pretty good, some electronic,some lounge, still others dub. This album is run of the mill hotel lounge music(but not a cool hotel, just an generic expensive one). I am a lounge/downtempo/house dj that has worked with this genre for close to ten years. This just didn't do anything for me. The song ""Atomic Cocktail"" is the only thing that remotely had any interest for me. One out of twenty tracks is not a good cd."
4,Saved my laptop,Received on time and in excellent condition. Breeze to install. Saved my Dell Inspiron 6000 from computer graveyard. Hopefully this small investment will reap another 4-5 years of computing life. Technology changes daily but this laptop suits our very basic computing needs. The new HD did increase our access speed. Very happy with our decision to purchase!
2,poorly packed for shipping glass bottels,"Received 3 glass bottles, poorly packaged, one bottel broke and the box was full of magnesium dust! Returned 2 weeks ago & have not yet received a confirmation of receipt from Amazon."
5,great fun,"Fast paced video is fun to learn with fun to watch, I went from knowing a couple of tricks to performing 8 -10 in a few weeks with this video. You will find yourself doing things you didn't think possible very quickly with this one. The performances are fun and inspiring. There is a wide varietyof skill levels displayed, so whatever level you're at- you can find something for you on this video."
1,Terrible example for young children!,"This arrogant, self-serving and badly written bio is not a role for children, instead it sets an egocentric, uneducated, uncompassionate, prejudiced, self-centered example!"
3,JUST OKAY,"Typical tunes that can be found anywhere. I'd like to purchase some of the more rare, hard to find gems."
3,This is an EPISTILARY novel!,"And, as such, it contains, gasp, epistles! It's not a 'gimmick', it's a bonifide plot device used quite extensively, especially during the period when the novel was written. Admittedly, it does make the novel a bit difficult to get into, which lowers my rating of the novel, and makes it somewhat unlikely that I will pick it up again any time in the near future. Also, it isn't fantasy, which just goes to show that the people hired to write cover blurbs are not in anyway required to read the book. The book does showcase the craft of Brust and Bull quite nicely, and is a pleasant departure from their usual urban fantasy."
4,Difficult to start but those who persevere will be delighted,I started reading this book after several people at the bookstore recommended it. That is the only thing that kept me going for awhile until I finally got caught up in it and the people came alive. (and you do not have to love philosophy to get through it!!!)
4,"Difficult to get into, but quite worthwhile","I bought the book to add to my collection of Brust and Bull, but it took me quite awhile to get it read. The first several letters and journal entries are confusing without background information, and I found myself putting it down in favor of other reads. Much if the discussion seemed tangential to the plot. Once I got past the first hundred pages, though, I was caught up in the story and finished it in a rush. Some other reviewers mentioned disappointment in the romantic ending. I disagree. I was quite impressed with the reconciliation of the heroine's love with her principles."
5,the all star vibrator,"If you're looking a discreet, small, nimble yet powerful vibrator, this is it. It has enough power to predictably do its job but it doesn't get in the way of lovemaking. It is the best vibrator on the market for use either solo or with couples. I've had my lily for over 3 years and it's still going strong...we affectionately refer to it as ""lily."""
1,Don't Buy,The product description describe the Lelo as deceptively powerfully. The deceptively is correct but powerful..NO! I liked the size and rechargeable but need to be redesigned to perform. Do waste your money.
1,breyerlady,I ordered a CD for my Daughter's birthday and was sent a DVD instead. I am not too thrilled right now.
4,easy and understandable,clear text and good arrangement of information made it easy to get a grip of what ent realy is .great as a companion in your clinical round .and for speady revision before your oral exam .
4,book review,"my son enjoyed the book. however, the picture of the book on amazon was of the new cover, and the book we received was the old cover, so my son was disappointed."
5,Awesome,"JUST AWESOME! This book is well written, easy to read, and set up perfectly on the kindle. Everybody should read this book. I enjoyed every minute of reading it."
4,Eagle Strike,"The title of this book is Eagle Strike it writen by Anthony Horowitz. This book is another Alex Rider adventure that is realistic fiction.This Book starts out exciting when Alex and a partner are sent to assasinate a man and when Alex gets back Yassen Gregorovich is there, and Alex is wondering why he is there because Yassen is an assasin to, so Alex figures out that he is there to kill someone and Alex tries to figure out who before it's to late.I think this is a good book with alot of detail and I think it's the best book that Anthony Horowitz's has written. I think this book is best for the ages of 13 to 15."
1,Rubbish!,"This is the most amateurish garbage I have ever had to sit through; I hate myself for having spent good money on it. If you care about what you watch, avoid this one. Unless, of course, you feel insecure about your own talents as a filmmaker . . . then you should definitely get it . . . it's a huge morale booster to know that there are many fathoms of mediocrity beneath you."
4,Worthy Of Praise,"Im in iraq right now so I was looking for a thermometer that would be able to withstand the heat here and measure it. Something that would go above 130 degrees and I found this. It isnt quite what I was looking for. Its for outside so you can walk outside and find out what the heat catagory is but It doesnt really tell you that its made for a window so that you can look at it from inside. I didnt know that when I purchased either of them. I only have 1 window that Im ever around and its in my room. But other then that, this thermometer is deffenatly worth buying. I took it out of the box today and it immeditatly jumped to 122 so I know it works. its not hard to overcome the window problem though. I took some super-glue and superglued one of them inside my office and one right out side my company and so far they stuck and worked throughout the sandstorm we had so if your looking for something good. this is it."
1,From Back Cover,Dinah St. Cloud wouldn't let her love of the Oregon wildness sweep her back into the arms of Paul McPherson again. Her instinct for self-preservation told her to stay far away from this heartthrob extraordinaire. He was just too handsome for her own good...Third in the Wild River Trilogy.
3,1612?,"Ok but a little hard to follow. Does'nt put you in the midle of the action like othe r epics such as Gladiator, Alexander,etc. Use as teaching tool must do a lot of pre-teaching with class to bring up to date."
2,teabag,"ok, probably needs deeper explaination of historical circumstances, like who was Boris Goudenov and what was the connection to Orthodox Church, Turkish expansion, RC church expectations, etc"
1,1612,It was the worse movie I had ever seen and it was a waste of my time and money to buy and see this crap and would be yours too if you are considering to buy it.
4,Godo Foreign Film,Enlightening as to historical action retold from a foreign perspective. I found the movie entertaining but the characters not to an American standard. Good acting should not come across as acting.
4,Novi V8 Indy Cars,"The book is quite good and technically precise. My only disappointments were that all the photos were black & white and that my favorite Novi, the 1963 Hotel Tropicana Special, driven by ""Herk"" was not clearly shown."
1,Not so sure about this doll,"I bought this doll for my daughter for christmas and she was so excited, however in the last three days I have found that this doll was not worth the price. The paint on the lips has already worn off, the eye lashes are falling out and it is difficult to keep the face clean, no matter how many times a day we wash it. It has also stopped drinking when the bottle is placed into it's mouth. I know of several other girls that are friends of my daughter who are having the same diffculties as we are. If my daughter didn't love this doll some much I would return it for something worth it. I guess if you are just intrested in making your child happy this is a good product however for the money I would suggest something else."
1,Face paint wiped off in first hour,"My Daughter wanted this doll for her 7th birthday. She was so happy she took her out of the box ad gave her a bottle right away. There was water drops on her face and she gently wiped it dry and most of her lips and eyebrows wiped off. The doll looked scary and my daughter was reduced to tears. I called and emailed Hasbro their reply was that was expected and they would send me something for the inconvenience. It was a $3 coupon I could use if I spent $5 dollars. My Father-in-law was an Engineer for matel, he said it should have not happen. Our Daughter will not play with the doll because she is scary looking. That was a big waist of money. Our doll might have been a defect, but they did not stand behind their toy.I have not bought anything from Hasbro since."
5,Black Light a must get,um I got it yesturday..I order it and it got me in say 4days due to processing and things.... the glow is strong...i use it to lite my aquarium..but I hate what I saw on the walls in my new apartment...it was like a scary movie...never lick a wall on a dare! BLEACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,NIV Bible on CD - The Perfect Gift!,"I purchased the NIV Audio Bible as a gift for my husband, and he LOVES it! He has been listening to the bible on cassette tapes for years, but the tapes were bulky and inconvenient for him to carry when he traveled. The quality of the CD's is superior to that of the tapes, and he is now able to easily carry a compact CD player with his CD's wherever he goes. I highly recommend the NIV Audio Bible Voice on CD!"
2,"Decent product, but could be better.","Although the narrator speaks clearly on the CD and is easy to understand, he has a sing-song voice which tends to put you to sleep. The audio mix leaves much to be desired; I have to turn the base all the way down and the midrange and treble all the way up on my car radio in order for the voice to sound somewhat natural. I have listened to many books on CD from Recorded Books, who employ professional actors/actresses as narrators, and that is the standard to which I am comparing this product. Zondervan could have put a little more money and effort into this product. After all the scriptures do say: ""Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord, not for men, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."" (Colossians 3:23,24)"
3,defective cd's,"The first time I ordered this product, it had a few CD's from the OT that would not play on my CD player and most of the NT CD's would not play. You were very nice and sent me another set. But unfortunately, still some of these CD's did not play on my CD player. I have not heard the status on this situation."
2,Ugh...,"I am a student of Mandarin Chinese, and that is why this book looked so appealing.This book is nothing more than the opinions of an amateur anthropologist. As others have said, it is full of value judgments and is condescending. It contains no references or citations. It could have been written 100 years ago. Its only value is as a study of what arrogant authors will churn out to make a buck. The suggested pronunciations are of limited value because they are incomplete and without tones. There are some interesting parts and it is a very easy read, but I wouldn't trust any of it to be 100% accurate."
3,Wish no Agave,"I love the taste and the fact that they are organic and raw, but will not eat any longer when realized they have agave. Wish they would sweeten with dates or something natural."
4,Till Morning Comes,"The story is set in China during the turbulent era between the end of WWII and the height of the Vietnam war. I found it fascinating and moving. As a third generation American communist, who has watched with horror how progressive ideology can be twisted into backwardness, I was impressed with her ability to show the good and the bad in a realistic, evenhanded way. I learned a lot that I hadn't known about the recent history of China. And of course the love story was beautiful and wrenching."
1,Bessey Clamp Rack - Inferior,The clamp rack that I received was not the one in the picture. What I received was poorly constructed and does not hold the clamps very well.The old Bessey clamp racks were fine. Do not waste your money.
5,a must have,This is a book that every serious bible student must have in their collection and every bible teacher should read I would recommend it to everyone.
2,Great for the winter,"This receiver runs very hot, regardless of where it is set up. There is a cooling fan attached to the back, but it has never kicked on and will supposedly do so only under heavy loads. I called Panasonic Customer Service and was told that the fan should come on and that I need to take it in for repairs. I would have been much better off buying something else. Soundwise it is very good and the built in tuner is a nice change from my old set up of having a separate tuner and amplifier. It is an affordable home theater component, but the heat issue is a real drawback."
5,Great tool bag!,"Purchased this bag for my Makita 6 1/2"" circular saw, batteries, blades and accessories. Perfect size for the job and made of very tough material. This bag fits into my objective of having either tool boxes or tool bags for my tools to protect them and make it easy to bring the right tools to the job site. Also, the color makes it very easy to find and finally, it's a Makita tool bag for a Makita tool. Price was right as well."
4,Delicious item,I tried the Goose Pate. This was my first time trying pate and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I tried it with Wheat Thin crackers and it was very tasty. The pate was smooth and creamy with a nice subtle flavor. I definitely will try new flavors.
5,Great pick from AMAZON!,"I bought this DVD as a gift for someone who seems to think Democrats invented bad political behavior. Apparently he has a very short memory, since he was alive, old enough, and smart enough to remember Lee Atwater. He needed a bit of a memory boost......and I gave it to him! After all, Lee Atwater helped elect THREE presidents, Bush 1, Bush 2, and (genuflect) Reagan!"
2,Biohazard,"The performance is here, and good, too bad the video and audio aren't. This is a little bit better than most youtube footage or bootleg VHS tapes that are out there. Hopefully we will get another one from the reunion tour."
4,Cavalier Book,"I buy one of these for all my new puppy families. It's complete, updated, lots of photos and very helpful information about the breed and dogs in general. A must for every first time Cavalier owner!"
2,I'm American and EVEN I SAY it isn't everything I expected..,"I'm a big fan of real trance like 'Hard Trance From Europe' by DJ Session One or artists like that. I like some of the songs (more specifically Outfly, Tara Lowe, J&R Project, Dee Dee, Kate Ryan, Hannah-Rose, LAAVA) which is the reason I put up with the other ones. For a ""trance"" CD, these song's are short and are okay if you're a radio-cut song addict. Not the best, but some songs are okay. Two stars. You earned every single one."
1,This gives Trance a bad name.,"It is a total discrace to call this trance. 'This is purely a collction of cheesy commercial dancemusic that should not be even remotely refered to as trance. Now as for the CD, the tracks are ok if you like this sort of pop music but don't misstake this for anything else."
1,Don't bother!,This is NOT a new video...it's 10 years old and has been re-released by her old distributor. Avoid it! Stick to the Walk Away The Pounds videos instead!
1,Avoid!,"I DEFINITELY agree with the other reviews. I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away the Pound series - even though I've been exercising regularly since I was a teenager, I mostly run or use machines and find most workout videos to be too complicated to be able to follow. I exercise for my health but I am just not athletically gifted and am definitely have ""two left feet."" ANyhoo, these videos have to be from, oh, the late 1980s as others have mentioned and Leslie seems to hae just discovered her ""walk"" system. The workout still incorporates old style high impact aerobics steps and the pace is so frenetic that there is definitely no toning benefit. Definitely avoid this one!"
1,Buy a different one!,"I loved the 1 mile, I loved the 2 mile, I loved the 3 mile... I hated this. Well, I need to qualify that: I hated the 6-7 minutes I had this playing, until I had had enoughand took it out of the DVD player. First, she is alone, at least in the beginning (do more people join her in her living room set later?), which is weird. Then, as mentioned below, she directs you according to the leg she is using, which will throw you off completely--you have to either follow what she says or ignore that and mirror her. She is sort of hopping (literally) around, even in the first 6-7 minutes, which I didn't like--it's *walk* aerobics.I love Leslie's other stuff and suggest that you just find a different one of hers and avoid this one."
1,Don't be fooled.,"I surely hope that no one in their right mind falls for this. All that is being sold is a cheap resister in a box with an LED bulb to look all high tech. Garbage like this will do nothing, in fact it may even damage your vehicle through its poor wiring and connections. Do not be fooled by fancy mumbo jumbo tech talk. It is $1.25 worth of materials to make it look like it does something.If you are that desperate to spend your money send it to me and I will come push your car by hand for a little extra power on take offs."
4,Good Food- Fast!,"I like this cookbook because it kept to basic ingredients. There is nothing worse than wanting to try a recipe and having to spend extra money on ingredients you will only use in one recipe. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but am looking forward to it soon."
3,"Its good for what it does,","Thing is, you really don't NEED all the extras. I was told it was a must to take my licensing exam... I never even use the special features. a dollar store model would have been fine. It does work and seems to be a good quailty."
1,I am amazed,"I am amazed at the content of this book. What Miss Faulkner did is important. It was the proper time for women to be admited to The Citadel. However Miss Faulkner was the wrong women. She repesented her entire gender horribly when she arrived at the school. She was not at all prepared for the hardships of knob year. She was a embaressment to all women. Miss Faulkner stayed at the actual Citadel for 4 hours before she quit. The rest of her hell week was spent in the infirmary where her tender nerves were attended to. She did this to prove a point and all she did was embaress herself and her gender. The author takes a view of someone who has heard only the bad facets of the school, but that is to be expected considering who provided her information.StevensJ@citadel.edu"
2,Included on the Complete Season set!,"In a very unclear and probably intentionally confusing marketing move, this and all of the other ""2-hour TV special"" Little House DVDs being released separated are actually included on the Complete Season box sets being released by the same company. I purchased three of these ""specials"" before realizing that they were all 2-part episodes to be found on the complete season sets. While I don't have a problem with these 2-part shows being released separately, I don't understand the need for it and I really, really wish that it would be made clear somewhere on the packaging. Considering that these single disc releases have no special features, this is the worst example of DVD ""double dipping"" I've seen in a long time!!"
4,Intense and Frightening Story,"Very interesting story, great insight to the psychology of a pedophile. Do not read if you have children or were molested as a child... you will cry for a week and possibly become violently ill while reading.The writing is in need of editing. The writer must write as he speaks. It is a friendly, uncle-ish tone but that tone took me out of being scared of the abomination from hell the book was about more often than not. Though, as a writer myself, I cannot be hard on the writer for this because it's hard to write horrors like this.However, the story is worth more than paid for and is incredibly hard to stop reading. Like a train wreck or poking the jellyfish with a long stick, you cannot help your morbid curiosity when holding this book.I would have given this book 3 stars because of the writing if the story hadn't been absolutely intriguing and frightening and so well organized.Good job, Mr. King"
1,Clogs the toilet!!!!,"I usually buy Kandoos for my daughter. I found these on a good sale, What a waste!!! They clogged the toilet, frequently! I took them out the bathroom and used them to wipe hands when we were out."
2,"An earlier documentary, repackaged","A warning to anyone who is considering purchasing this DVD: ""Bono: Big Daddy"" is nothing more than a repackaged and retitled version of a previous documentary called ""Bono: God's Favorite Son"". The two programs are otherwise identical. This is a typical unauthorized bio. Because Bono and U2 were not involved, there is no U2 music. While the description on the sleeve promises interviews with the ""friends and family members who know him best"", as far as I know, none of the journalists, radio DJs and record producers featured in this program are related to Bono by blood, marriage or otherwise. Whether any of them would be considered among Bono's closest friends is debatable. Some of the interviews are mildly interesting, but if you're expecting members of Bono's inner circle to reveal his deepest darkest secrets, you will be disappointed. All in all, this might be a fairly entertaining rental, but it's certainly not worth the retail price."
5,Thick book ideal to swat those nasty enviromentalists,"I had always felt that there was something inconsistent with the fact that people are living longer worldwide and all the bad news in the media. This books explains how all we get is the bad news about the shape the world is in and how often this news are based only in the opinions ( and values) of ""experts"" that are more interested in advancing their agendas than the truth ( VP Al Gore is one of them beware!!!). One thing about this book is that it gave me an enormous amount of information to squash the uninformed sentimental enviromentalists at parties, wetlands, farmland, rain forests, food, there is a chapter for every ""issue""."
4,Good product,"My son love this, as do I. The plastic air soft bb's stick to the board, so when he's done shooting, he can just pick them off and reuse them (he doesn't have to go searching for bb's [unless of course he misses]). GREAT idea! Only 4 stars b/c the sticky part is starting to pull out of its holder after only 4 weeks of use. Though I don't know if it's a design flaw or misuse from my son."
4,Nice,Really useful for some fun target practice with friends or for adjusting sights. My AEG rifle put some pretty big dents in this thing and I was all the way across the room so it can't handle powerful guns that well.
1,really disappointed.,This is made of all plastic and its the cheap plastic that breaks really easy. I was using my sig p226 for 40 feet away and it just tore right through it. I took the sticky part off of it and just stuck it to the wall and it worked fine that way.
4,Indoor shooting is back,"Delivered today, on an icy day. My day was made. I enjoy shooting airsoft with this target. Makes shooting fun and neat. Easy Clean up. Perhaps Crosman will make bigger versions and animal versions. Overall fun target."
4,this target is weak,"this target is really good for airsoft pistols, but when i use it for aifsoft JG M4 it broke after one round shooting, it really sucks"
1,have return it,the bbs does not stick in the target as advertised. I have tested from different distances but it just dont stick.
2,Okay,"The tackiness degrades over time and it wont stand on its own to a shot from an Airsoft gun (you'll need to put something behind it). The dents your gun will inevitably make on this won't disappear and certainly wont withstand repeated hits in the same area. Not worth buying unless the only guns you own are extremely low FPS. If that's true, however, they are probably not accurate enough to even need a target like this."
1,Recumbent Bike,"I did receive this item in a timely manner, but when I took it out of the box, one of the plastic sides was broken and cracked. (Pieces were broken out of the side.) I put the bike together to see if it would work. It worked, but made noises and it didn't shift to a higher resistence. VERY dissapointed!!"
5,Best exercise bike ever!,"First off, I did the free Super Saver shipping and got it within four business days. It is very easy and simple to assemble; my dog could have figured it out. And when other reviews said this bike was quiet, they weren't kidding! It barely makes any noise at all. And the knob to change resistance works easily. I would recommend this to any family member that is looking for an exercise bike. Personally, I think I got a very good product at a really good price."
3,Broken!,"First, let me say that I know it's stupid to not have opened the box right away and instead had it sitting around for months. Mea culpa.However, I finally did open it to set it up, and it's incredibly broken in the front. Whoever boxed it was aware of this, because some parts are held together by rubber bands and tape! I really wish I had opened it when it arrived so I could return this broken piece of crap.Edit: I contacted the company and they were able to send me the replacement parts necessary, but the bike still isn't great. The computer part already broke which I've read is common as it's very cheap, the seat wobbles and some parts were difficult to put together."
1,Boring!,"I got this DVD for the kids to start learning Spanish. I may as well have just invested in some Dora DVD's, since the DVD only showed the kids pictures and said the names of the items in Spanish. I don't call that immersion, and it was VERY boring for the kids. Anyone who has or knows kids knows that they learn best when they are being stimulated and entertained. This definitely is not stimulating or entertaining. If this is what the whole Muzzy system is like, I'm glad I found out now, instead of spending the ridiculous amount of money that they charge for the full program. I'll be looking for another program."
1,Rasberry Raw revolution bar YUCK,"The bar looks good on the ingredients list, but it tastes bad. It has an oil film all around it. To eat these every day I could not do it, if it were a survival situation I could probably choke them down as the have no after taste thanks to the oil film."
1,yuk...,this stuff tastes horribles. its has to be healthy if it taste bad enough to make your eyes tear...
4,good little mouse,"Bought as a replacement for a worn out MS mouse, this one functions just fine and, as opposed to the white mouse, won't get nearly as dirty.Good product."
5,We cannot be deaf to the desperate cry of our own homes!,"This book is an urgent message to all families today. It deals with problems at home such as rivalries between siblings, hurtful arguments at home, rebeling and disrespecting parents, prolonged periods of indiference and not only that but also the methods and solutions do deal with the desperate cry of a home that disintegrates more and more each day. There is a reason for the way we act in our homes and sometimes we know it but we don't want to or we don't know how to deal with it. If you think I am confusing you, just read the book, you'll understand what I am talking about. All I have to say is that it is the best book I have read and if you know how to read beyond the letters and the story, you'll really find it useful in your own life!"
1,The worst,"Set of books ever....It is ultracatholic propaganda of the worse kind... the intelectual value of the whole set of books is negative. One of those authors that dont even write their own books but have their contracted mercenaries by the church.If you read it and like it, you need psichiatric help."
4,Unusually hard biting SF drama,"Great series with interesting ethical dilemmas. Asks some tough but valid questions. Despite the occasioanal cliche and at times uneven acting from some of the minor characters, BG provides great entertainment. It offers well developped central characters interpreted by generally strong actors and interesting insights into problems we face today. Battlestar Galactica is a modern allegory relevant to a broad range of TV viewers. Not just for scifi aficionados."
4,Beyond Atlantis Double pack,Both Beyond Atlantis & Beyond Atlantis 2 comes in this double pack. Both games are point and click games. I use to own Beyond Atlantis. The puzzles are challenging. Both Beyond Atlantis and Beyond Atlantis 2 will run on Windows 7 Professional 32 bit. I'm not sure about the 64 bit version of Windows 7 since I don't have a copy to test it on. But Beyond Atlantis 2 requires the patch from the publishers which at the time of this post is still available. Both games are interesting story to play. Although some puzzles are tricky some of them are easy to figure out.
5,LUV IT!!!,i've read most of dessen's books and i think this is the best one!!! in a few years i could have easily written this about myself. the characters were realistic and quirky at the same time. this is a really great book and all people 13+!!!
5,Loved it.,"I have a strict rule for myself; I won't write a review unless I have a high praise for a book. The Truth About Forever was inspiring. I loved the closeness of the Wish Catering Crew. They were like a big family. My favorite moments were all of Monica and Kristy scenes and how close they were. They were never, and I mean NEVER far from each other and I mostly think that it's because of their past(read the book to know what I'm talking about). They made me laugh with the way Kristy knew how Monica was feeling when nobody else could. Bert was hilarious. He cracked me up. It's a good book and totally worth every penny. : ) BUY IT."
5,a really good book!,"This book is great! I read it in one day. Everyone knows Macy as the girl who saw her father die, her mother never talks to her and her boyfriend Jason is going away for the summer to Brain Camp. Macy, then meets the Wish Catering crew. Pregnant Delia, nerdy Bert, friendly Kristy, quiet Monica and gorgeous Wes. Wes has his own share of problems, he got busted for breaking into a house and he is an artist. Macy feels that everything has to be perfect, her boyfriend is perfect and she accepts that she will never be. Wes, though likes flaws. One night they began a game Truth. They keep asking questions back and forth and whoever passes will win the game. Macy begins to accept that her father dying was not her and begans to move on with her life, with the help of Wes.I really enjoyed this book, I thought it brought out a lot of topics about being perfect and if anything would last forever. Macy was a great main character who was easy to identify with. Read it!"
4,Nice,"I actually read this novel before reading ""That Summer"" and ""Someone Like You"" and i liked it a lot better than the other two because generally I like books with depth and this book definetly has and extordinary amount of depth covering not just one characters story, but many. The realisticness of this novel was also something I liked about it. A novel about loss, change, growth, love, and moving on. It's nice."
4,The Truth About Forever,"I thought The Truth About Forever was a really good young adult book because it goes through greif, love, and family relationships. I really liked how Wes and Macy played that game together, I think it made the book. I really like the part where it talked about forever. Forever could be the next min or in one hundred years and it is how you make it. It also showed how you should do what makes you happy not other people."
5,41/2?!,"I cannot believe that anyone gave this book anything other than five stars! It's my favorite of all the books. It has a great story, as do all of Dessen's books. You really fall in love with the characters in this story. I've let at least 5 friends borrow this book to read it, and all became Dessen fans."
5,"The one that started the craze, and still fun","Anybody that calls DOOM ""very poor"" does not know his gaming history, among other things.Wolfenstein 3D was arguably the grandaddy of FPS games, but DOOM is the one that really started the craze. I was absolutely addicted to DOOM when it came out.If you have been weened on only the newer 3D accelerated games such as Half Life, Quake III, and Unreal Tournament, then DOOM's non-accelerated ""2.5D"" graphics might look very dated and ugly to you these days. But in 1994, this was IT. And guess what? For pure shoot-em-up gameplay, weapon balance, and atmosphere, it is STILL hard to beat DOOM.I am still giving this one 5 stars. It will always be a classic. Any game that can suck me in and keep me, red-eyed, staring at my monitor for months on end (with DM play and user maps)...well, you can't ask for much more than that.Though I, too, have moved on to other newer games, if you've never played DOOM before, you owe it to yourself to experience it. Fantastic stuff."
3,Good try,A somewhat convoluted book about an American lady who moves to a village in the Punjab state of India to marry her Indian Sikh boyfriend she met in college in California. The problem is he is already 'married' to his elder brother's widow - a cultural mechanism to handle such problems. The author provides a nice tale of tension between the two wives. Characters are well developed and descriptions are good. Am not sure why the 'looking back' style of writing a la Titanic but that's ok. I enjoyed the book and feel Ms. Singh has done a good job with it. For a very similar TRUE story read 'An Indian Attachment' by Sara Lloyd - super book.
1,Plain and a Downer,"The songs have nothing catchy whatsoever. They are drab and you just want to fall asleep. The song ""Would"" was her best song (from a previous album). That was a much better sound than this."
3,A bit much...,"I saw a clip on YouTube and just had to get this DVD. Huge band, tons of instruments - sounds just like a 45 from the sixties (I mean that in a good way).But, boy, was it tough getting through a whole hour of this. There were no dynamics to the show - no quiet time, no smaller ensemble pieces - just full-on bombast for an hour. The first song lasted 17 minutes, but I got the point after 3 minutes.I know everyone else has given the Polyphonic Spree great reviews because they certainly create a spectacle, but I prefer more variety in a concert. And they should either shorten their songs or add bridges in the middle to break the monotony."
4,Generally speaking I found the book to be very enlightening.,"Most of the commentaries were understandable and helpful. They expanded on the sutras which were very brief and needed explanation. The author provided those explanations. Being a Christian rather than a Hindu or Bhudist, some of the material was questionable in my ""western"" mind. I found the glossary to be indispensable."
3,Jackie Superstar - Irving Groupie?,"This book is not brilliantly written and tends to ignore the trashy, brassy side of Jacqueline that we all love, but hey it's written by a devoted husband. If you are reading this after devouring ""Lovely Me"" by Barbara Seaman you may even wonder if it's about the same Jacqueline Susann! All in all it's a sweet book that is written by a man that obviously, truly adored his wife."
2,"What the Heck, Man?","Lightning fast shipping. Obviously a rediculous low price, one problem is that it was the wrong product. The image shown is not the flag I received! What up with that? For the price, I'm not going to bother sending it back, the flag they sent was cool, but it's not the one I ordered. I'll order the correct one, just not from this vendor!"
2,Moultrie Flag- No Joy,"Flag ordered on 9/5. Still not yet rec'd (10/10). Please trace for me. Thanks. FIFTEEN, SIXTEEN, SEVENTEEN, EIGHTEEN, NINETEEN, TWENTY. Carl Strang TWENTY-ONE, TWENTY-TWO"
3,"The ""GUIDE"" for CMM","The book is a good one, but I , as a person new to implementing software process improvement in my small organization read this book and it just flew over my head, it needs a HIGH LEVEL of understanding the process - to be precise.The materials in this book are available as downloadable PDFs in the SEI-CMM site for all the KPAs."
2,"good, but beware!",This book explains the internals in great detail but is still easy to follow. Quite a lot of examples are also provided ( eg. a ps - like command ). But this book is written for SCO and is only limites applicable to other platforms! So beware!
4,Excellent review of ND evolution inconsistencies,"It provides very good, clear and useful information about the real status of neodarwinian mechanism, mainly concerning the inadequacy of random mutation+selection to both repair genome degradation and macroevolution. It is of particular importance that many nails used for the coffin are provided directly by strict darwinian researchers such as Haldane and Kimura! 4 stars only because the author has in some points actually argued towards a YEC position.Note for #1 reviewer: it is not correct that the author does not consider duplication as a possibility for random evolution. Indeed, in his answers to objections at the end of the book, he explains why gene duplication does not theoretically improve the plausibility of the primary axiom."
5,Welcome to the 21st century,In the this book the author makes case against natural selection base on mountain of facts. He quotes of a lot peer review papers to make his case. He geneticist and very good understanding of all subtheories out there. I can't believe that other people can see what is really happening this think evolution is possible. Any open minded person saw data than they would not think Neo Drawn evolution is even possible. It seem to me that Darwinist want to think that their theory is true at all cost. Also I can not believe it took about 150 years to prove that Darwin's theory is not true. Yet the one still taking shape feels a lot like general relativity of biology.
4,Billy's live and I like it,"I saw him back in the eighties and enjoyed him then. This concert sounds better. I love the fact that Nylon Curtain in well represented, That is my favorite album (CD) ROOM OF OUR OWN,lAURA AND ALLENTOWN sound fresh as ever. Italian Rest. is the bomb for Billy. All good stuff. Hes real, no BS."
5,Billy Joel Live-just like the concert without the lights.,"Discs are great. I went to his concert in November 2007, and left with a desire to get a hold of some of the music and adrenalin of the concert. You will find it close in this collection."
3,real Good,"now I have heard&Seen Billy Joel do other live shows&also on Record so this collection is real good,but not quite on par with some of the other Joel Live Releases. His voice is good for the most part. Piano Playing is still on point&his Band is tight&Well rehearsed.all the standard Billy Joel tracks are here.he is long overdue to release a new album.it would be interesting to hear what he has now,but for now we have another collectionof Live hits which are good."
3,So incomplete...,"I really enjoy and love Billy Joel music and that's why I may regret about skiping some of my favourite songs from this album. According to me, Billy Joel shouldn't have forgotten songs like ""Uptown Girl"", ""Tell Her About It"", ""Honesty"" and ""Just The Way You Are"". Come on, these are 4 of my favourite songs!"
5,Easy Read and Well Worth It,"I blew threw this book. It is such an easy read and it held my interest the whole way through. Now, I consider myself different for even having an interest in this book because I think the people who NEED to read this book would never even consider it. Jon Huntsman calls for a return of old time values where your word is your bond and you consider giving more than hoarding.It was an excellent book and it helped me look at all aspects of my life and work and find room for improvement throughout. I highly recommend it to everyone with a conscience."
2,can't believe him,"I read this book concerning ""integrity"" and agree with content, values expressed, however I do not agree that ""company"" owned by Huntsman adheres to any values... at least not recently. My advise is ""walk the walk"" before telling the tale.Carol WeyleColorado Mom"
1,Awful,I'm a huge horror fan. I picked this up b/c it was fairly cheap to rent and was hoping for something good since it starred Judd Nelson. It wasn't good. It was truly terrible. I ended up fast forwarding a good chunk b/c the acting is over the top. The twist is so obvious it is laughable. Don't waste your TIME.
5,It feels good to know that I am not alone.,"Ever felt strongly against one or several of the religious doctrines with which you grew up, but often wondered about your feeling? For example the last line of one of my favourite prayers,- The Our Father, says, ""World without end, Amen."" Yet there are so many priests and preachers out there who preach fire and brimstone religion. Why would a God who is love destroy? If you have ever had similar feelings, then read Encounter with a Prophet. It is marvellous. Thank you C. A. Lewis."
2,For the spiritual neophyte !,"As one previous reviewer stated, ""It was written, I think, to help the average man ..."" And certainly for the neophyte seeker, this is a great beginners book! However, those who are further along on their spiritual path, might do well to pass on this book as it is a bit pricey for the small content it provides."
1,Sorry...,"This book is terrible. So simplistic that it appears that the author is merely 'preaching to the choir'. The people (person) that have given it good reviews are obviously just reaffirming their faith and not giving it critical praise at all. I was hoping to find a book that would argue all aspects of religion and the existence/non-existence of a supreme being (God, Allah, Odin, whatever), but this is simply a christian attempt to foist their ideas on the world as fervent missionaries. Didn't change my life."
5,Tight,"The cd is tight, its hardcore gritty and grimme, from the KC MO. If your into Tech 9, this is a good buy, but if you like some of that hardcore gangsta ish go out buy this. The only thing is, that it is rare and out of print, so you'll have to order it off the internet somehow."
5,Great video to get a toddler ready for bed.,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this video, and she is a big Minnie Mouse fan. We use this video to help her get tired for bed. It contains two stories, that we let her watch to unwind for bed. I plan on buying more of her tapes."
1,This book is truly fiction,This book is amazing. This author lives in the mountains and does not do any of the things this suggests. Can you say Hypocrite???Why would you buy a book from someone who writes it for money but does not live by the things she professes. I would call the woman and ask her why????
3,Some distractions throughout,"I appreciate Price's passion for living simply and authentically. Throughout the book, however, I was distracted by two things:1. Poor grammar throughout. I guess Price wouldn't feel like an authentic writer if he had hired an editor.2. Simple living is always a great thing when you put the burden of raising your children on your spouse. While Price wrote of the small amounts of money he made and of his own expenditures living his life, I wondered how in the world his ex-wife/partner, who lived elsewhere, sometimes very far elsewhere, was raising their two children and going to school at the same time. I don't doubt Price's love for his family. His lifestyle and theirs just weren't compatible. He and his children's mother made it all happen. It would be interesting, though, to hear their points of view about this family arrangement.Still, there were good thoughts and ideas to be gleaned from this book."
1,What a flake!,"I was required to read this book for school. Our entire class agrees : Dan Price is a flake who has no concept of simplicity. If everyone is the world lived as he did we'd be extinct by now. He abandoned his wife and kids because he couldn't hack it in civilized society. He claims to only need 80 sq ft of living space, yet he sprawls over 5 acres with a tipi, a sauna, and a studio to house his copy machine. The whole thing is wired for electricity and when he tires of a structure, instead of reusing the materials, he burns it. Very eco-friendly. He mis-quotes Zen philosophy, and has the audacity to compare himself to Thoreau. If you are seeking simplicity and balance in your life LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
1,Not recommended,"This book claims that ""Mercury has no gravity"" and that ""volcanoes are made of lava"". I realize the science needs to be simplified for a young audience, but it should stick to facts."
4,Baby loves the visuals.,"I purchased this for a newborn, but it didn't get used. I am nowusing it with my 1 and a half year old granddaughter. She lovesthe pictures. I hope the sounds are getting through to her, too."
1,Rambling throw away,"A glossery of muslim and punk words is needed to plow through this rambling throw away.Touted as the mindset of a contemporary Americanized Islam twenty something, it is merely junvenile mumbling. This is a rant by a muslim brainwashed punker. If nothing else, it demonstrates what evolves from a mindset of religious ignorance."
5,A Family of Her Own,I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire series. Cute and lots of fun.Brenda Novak is tells a great story. I have actually started buying some of her other series.
1,Less than 30 minutes long; poor value,"While this DVD starts out well it is less than 30 minutes long and only touches on the most basic themes. There is very little detail or in-depth exploration of the causes of the war other than the obvious. The same segment repeats again and again on the DVD. I am not sure what the purpose of this DVD really is -- schoolroom use?Skip this one and buy the two ""classics"": the CBS ""The Complete Story of World War I"" narrated by Robert Ryan and the UK Channel 4 ""The First World War"" narrated by Jonathan Lewis."
5,The best Singer out there,"Ayla, is one of the most talented Young Adults. She has the voice, the looks, everything. I myself am i huge fan of hers. Her Single is absolutely amazing. Lyrics are great and most of all she sounds wonderful."
5,"Listen up, these guys rule","Himsa is one of the best metalcore bands out there, and if they manage to hang in there, they could soon be one of the scene leaders. This album is full of solos left and right, as well as absolutely amazing guitar work. This feels like an attempt to bring the style of 80's thrash and mixing it with new school metal and hardcore. Here are the facts: no whiny emo singing here, not too many breakdowns, just amazing guitar work and a great metal sound with tough guy vocals. Although breakdowns are sometimes essential in a hardcore band, Himsa does just fine without them. To tell you the truth this sounds more like a metal CD, but it is easy to listen to and not too brutal. If you want a good metal CD with hardcore ethic you should pick this up and skip the 100's of poser bands inhabiting the genre."
4,"Interest of the CD, the vocals are not surprising - INDEED",Love this album will remind of hauntingly similar sound that Chimaira has out called Impossibility of Reason. Might want to check that one out or be like me and take out the samples to find out what I mean.
3,Cute but uncomfortable,"These are incredibly cute, but they aren't as comfortable as other Enzo shoes I have purchased in the past. I've never done well with ankle straps, and these shoes are no exception. The ankle straps dig into the back of my ankle so it's difficult to wear without bandaids. But it's not uncomfortable enough for me to get rid of. After all, they are fabulously cute."
2,"OK, but there are much better","I have been using basic recipes for a long time with much success and so decided to get a cookbook with more interesting recipes. I thought that this one looked good, but was totally wrong. I have tried seven different recipes now and all have flopped. The tops always cave in and every one has been too salty. Perhaps I could adjust the measurements, but I feel like it is the job of the authors to get it right in the first place."
5,Variety,After much anticipation I finally got my first bread machine and with it I ordered this book. I'm sure glad that I did because the one that came with my machine was quite sparse. It is a great book with a variety of different kind of breads. I also thought that it does a decent job of giving you so good basic information about baking in a bread machine.I enjoyed it so much I'm getting one for my father for Christmas and ordering the 2nd book as well.
4,Making it happen!,I bought this book to replace one that I lost for my Oster Bread machine. I have tried several of the recipes already.It has so many more recipes than my original book had. I am excitedly looking forward to use it for many many years to come.I am going to make the Leilani bread this week. It will probably become my new gift exchange for the Christmas holiday.Thank you so much for making it available.
3,OK Book. Not the Best Not the Worst,After all the positive reviews I felt let down. OK recipes but nothing great. Strange measurements as a range of amounts of flour are used in specific recipes.Kind of cheap material used in the physicality of the book.
1,It's not that good.,"The recipes follow one formula...all require butter. The authors have not actually considered other ingredients, like olive oil, so it is up to the user to experiment. I was hoping for a no brainer-tried and true-kind of recipe book. Color me disappointed."
5,The best bread machine book ever!,"I have so many bread books, however; this one is by far one of the best bread books. You have three choices from small to med, large loafs. It is a must have book."
2,"Eh, not fantastic","I bought this game looking to expand beyond simple puzzle games. My biggest issues are the graphics are too tiny to really see what's going on. So the game pieces are hard to move around. I think if you want a computer version of the games, buy a version for a PC where you can see better what's going on and have more control.A neat idea, but not suitable to the tiny screen of a DS."
2,not as fun as the original nintendo version,Too much running around with not much adventure. Too easy to get by obstacles. Too much guesswork trying to figure out what to do. My 8 and 10 year old like the original version much better.
2,"big games, little screen",The Battleship/Connect4/Sorry/Trouble game for DS lite was not easy to understand and as fun to follow and play as the actual board game versions. It's difficult to know when and where to move and therefore not fun as much as it is tedious.
4,Battleship - Trouble - Sorry -Connect 4,My kids think it great. They can play these games with each other and don't have the mess to clean up or have to be in the same room to play.
4,Great combination of games,"I purchased this game for my 8-year-old grandson. He has played all four games in the traditional versions, and loves the DS games. The only problem that both he and I have is with the Connect Four game. The black pieces are hard to see because the background is also dark. And, at the end of your turn, the stand rotates to reveal the opponent's view, which we find confusing."
5,Awesome Book,"Just what all of us fossil hunters wanted. Well written book covering everything on Megalodon. Great pictures, too."
3,A not so date with dager,"In the first episode momiji gose on a ""date"" with Kusanagi.And a new type of aragami apears along with a new rival Murokumo.The second episode momiji also has her ""first kiss.""And Murokumo explains some of his mision to momiji and kusanagi.Over all, this was a good and funny volume of Blue Seed. I recomend Blue Seed to anyone. It's a great show that you have got to see."
1,wish I could review it,"I ordered it a month ago, and now told I may have to wait another month! Disappointed to see the page still says it ships in 1-2 weeks. If you are in a hurry for this item, go elsewhere."
4,Interesting Book..,"This was a very interesting and fascinating book. It describes quite well and in detail the fall of Enron. Although there were so many characters, it was well-organized and easy to follow. I would recommend this book if you are interested in the fall of Enron or corporate greed. It's rather interesting. However, I would have like more on where the key players ended up as it didn't seem to get into that great of detail at the end."
2,Not up to my expectations,"The confetti was not what I was hoping for. Not enough bubbles, price and amount are okay."
5,Listening to the self,"Some reviewers of this book seem to have missed the point totally. Gideon (or Yellowfeather or Chang or Donald Shimoda) are not external guides -- they are ourselves. We all have an inner teacher that guides us through life if we can learn to listen to it. This book is a parable on life. When we learn to listen to what we know to be true, then we will truly be happy, no matter how many bill collectors are nipping at our heels.WHEN YOU CAN WALK ON WATER, TAKE THE BOAT is a delightful book on the discovery of the self. This book is about a journey, not a destination - it's a journey that we are all on."
3,Nothing watered down about this book,"This book is a quick read, the title makes you think, mind stretching.The note I wrote to myself after I read the book the first time around was:""When you can accomplish good/great things, do it quietly in a simple way. Don't flaunt your abilities. Stay humble, be simple, uncomplicated. This reduces stress and does not bring attention to you.""I use this every day."
1,Propaganda,"I find this book interesting, but the author is clearly biased. Anyone who goes to the Al-Jazzere website qould find it is full of Anti-Semetic and Anti- Americian Materal"
5,A great workout in 30 minutes!,"I highly recommend this workout. Leslie is very encouraging and gives you the motivation to keep going right through to the end. It's easy and fun. Before you know it, the workout is done. You can even do this if you don't have alot of room. You can do it in place.It's great to see a group of women on a workout video that are just like you and me, not thin and perfect. This is a great cardiovascular workout and you do work up a bit of a sweat. It's low-impact, so you are not jumping around like most aerobic videos."
4,A Great Beginning!,"This is a great video for those who are just starting an excersize program. It's fun, easy to follow, and you'll actually feel as though you're one of the group! Leslie's great!"
5,Great walking programme.,"I purchased this and the Miracle Mile together. Both are good. The Miracle Mile is good for days when we are short of time and energy. It takes only 15 to 20 minutes. But the 2 Miles programme is one of Leslie's best videos. I have also tried many of her other videos,but I always seem to come back to this 2 mile video.It has a variety of moves which keep you going till you realise the 2 miles is over. It has a good pace and makes you sweat.The meter which tells us the time and distance covered is also helpful. I would also like to add that Leslie's walking programmes have kept me consistent with exercise. I would recommend this to anyone who may want to start some aerobic exercise. The steps are not as difficult as other aerobic programmes and are easy to follow. Also the programme is low impact for people who may not be able to do any high impact aerobics."
5,Two Mile Walk,"I hate exercise; I love Leslie Sansone. She is fun, friendly, supportive and non-threatening!After alternating In-Home Walking (with weights)-a favorite-with Miracle Mile (no wgts.) for about four years, I have now used this one and the Two Mile Walk and Firm about 5 times. The first two are perfect for beginners; the second two are more intense and good workouts. The Two Mile Walk is with a group, in a gym, no wgts. (you could add them); the Two Mile Walk and Firm is without the group on her gorgeous patio in Pennsylvania and alternates between aerobics, no wgts., and firming, with wgts. You can stop any time and fst.fwd. to cooldown. You can also fst.fwd. her success stories after the 1st time! I am still not bored with In-Home Walking and feel the same about the Two Mile Walk. They are actually fun!"
5,Leslie Sansone Two mile Walk,I have several of Leslie Sansone's tapes but this is my favorite. It's easy to do and keeps you moving. It's was a little challenging in parts for me at the beginning but now it's easier and it's fast. Before you know it - time is up! I've recommended this one to several people. I love being able to work out at home and I don't need huge space to do this. Way to go Leslie!
1,"BE CAREFUL OF THE ""DARK"" EPISODE!","My 2 1/2 year old son loves Curious George and we already owned the Zoo Night DVD so when this came out it seemed like a no brainer. Unfortunately, once he saw the ""Dark"" video our lives were turned upside down. He became afraid of the dark and monsters. He was truly petrified at bedtime to the point of being almost hysterical. It took about 5 or 6 weeks (and numerous books, conversations with his pediatrician and calls to other moms) but he is finally sleeping through the night! All of this because of the ""Dark"" episode on this video. I had to tell my son the garbage man came and took this dvd and crushed it and took it to the landfill. I only gave it one star because even if the other episodes are fine it is not worth the pain it caused us."
2,"Disappointing, very light on substance","I've been a huge fan of Newt for years. His contract with America strategy in 1994 was brilliant. But as with movie sequels, this contract sequel is very light on content and generally disappointing. The amount of research and details of his proposals did not come accross as thorough. Many topics were discussed in a page or two. Sorry, friends on the right, I cannot in good conscience recommend this book."
1,"Newt? You're kidding, right?","All I need do to rate this book (I didn't say I didn't open it) is to read that Newt considers one of the prime problems with America is the lack of GOD.When Newt owns up to his own shallowness and lack of integrity, then I might be able to listen to him preach about God. Then again, maybe not.Newt displayed his own sense of Godliness, righteousness and holiness when he walked out on his cancer-stricken wife. What a guy! I mean it. But would I spend 50 cents on a book he wrote?Probably not."
2,Open Face Helmet Headset Kit,Headset Kit appears to be of good quality but there are too many connections and the wires are way too long. I think they are long enough to be dangerous due to entanglement while riding. If I cannot cut the wires to a reasonable length I will never use the product.
5,"Works great, easy to install",This was easy to install and works great. I was surprised at how well everything works and the volume through the speakers was excellent. I was worried that it wouldn't be loud enough to hear over road noise but it is quite loud if turned all the way up.
2,hmm doesn't seem to fit,I bought this hard case and first thing i noticed is that it doesn't fit perfectly from the top and bottom. I can slide the ipod up and down the case. Worst thing is that when i need to plug my ipod to the computer. I have to slide the ipod all the way down for the plug to fit. There is like 3mm of extra space on the top when i slide it all the way down.
4,crkt guppie,"I am eleven and have carried a knife with me since I was eight. I have had the crkt drifter before and loved so I think crkt is a great company. My brother bought the lil guppie and I was very impressed. this knife is perfect because It comes in handy so often. It is a little to large to fit in a pocket so it has a nice carabeiner to clip on a belt loop. the knife is great. It is not a survival knife, but not a classic small dull swiss army knife blade. The flash light on the bit holder is not great ,but it is better than nothing. The screwdriver works great for me,( opening battery powered toy to mod or change the batteries). I do sometimes think the magnetic bit carrier will fall of, so far this knife has worked great."
4,great knife,this crkt knife is amazing. Its small but its a good product. The only thing that has gone wrong so far was the belt clip on the knife fell off. Thats it. Not bad. I still like the knife.
3,Almost two stars.,"Almost gave it two stars but other than the problem I encountered I thought that it was a cool, handy, little tool. The first time I put a bit into the driver the magnet came right out when I took the bit off. Without the magnet the bits fall right out. It looked like it had just been glued in there with some rubber cement or something. I was a bit dissapointed and took it right back to the store where it was purchased. Also the knife was on the dull side and the bit holder seems like it can fall off easily while the Guppie is being worn on a belt. Great idea but they need to be screwing their magnets in place or stabilizing them with something besides glue. I think three stars is quite generous. Maybe their newer model was engineered correctly so that the magnet won't just fall out with basic usage."
3,Too big and heavy.,"The wrench wobbles too much, extra screwdriver bits seems unnecessary. Get a lil Guppie instead."
3,basic tool,Got a climber/ hiker in the fam? This is a good product for them. Adjustable wrench a bit weak but hex head set up good for use. blade holds edge well.
3,Small,This looks big but its actually pretty small. Got it for my brother and he like it regardless but i do wish it was bigger
5,"(Miller+Joyce)+(Prozac+Therapy)=""Robert""","A thoroughly enjoyable read, especially the New Orleans chapter. Any woman who follows ""the rules"" should read this book (sort of an anti-rule book) and guys should be able to somewhat identify with ""Robert"". Excellent writing style."
1,Deceptive Title,"Walk the Walk is not walking at all as much as it is dancing and unless you are able to and like to do dance steps, I strongly recommend that you DO NOT purchase these DVDs. I previously had the VHS ""Walk Away the Pounds"" set of tapes for 1, 2 and 3 miles and because of an accident needed to replace them. I have osteo and rheumatoid arthritis and walking with those tapes was something I could do using my walker. I couldn't keep up with the new ""Walk the Walk"" pace and found myself getting angry and frustrated with this program. I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this product."
2,not the best,didn't really care many of the cakes at all. not up to normal standing for wilton yearbooks of the past. the best cake is on the cover.
5,These are money well spent!,"The previous reviews are correct - these are good chisels at an amazing price. Though I am mostly a power tool guy, I do use chisels a lot for fine tuning mortises, paring tenons, flush trimmimg dowel plugs, etc. I have found that these chisels hold an edge for a good while. Do they hold an edge as long as a 200 dollar set? Of course not, but if you are willing to sharpen a bit more often you can save a LOT of money by buying these chisels. The handles are reliably strong. If I need extra force I always strike my handles with a rubber mallet. I previously owned the six piece set of these chisels. When they were stolen, I decided that the box was not worth much (it is not all that nice) and that for a lot less money I could do without the extra 2 chisels. So I bought this 4 piece set and found it to be a good decision - I don't miss the other two at all!Buy these - they are inexpensive and a VERY good value for the money."
2,So-So Sequel,"I enjoy Patterson and read all his books. WHEN THE WIND BLOWS was one of my favorite books but LAKE HOUSE can not compare.It is very similar to the first one but does not have the punch. It is predictable and non-believable in several places.Patterson took a great subject and did not appear to work at creating a great book. It seemed like he rushed it and did not take the time to put his true genius to work.Based on the ending, it appears obvious Patterson is planning another sequel to this. I hope he takes the time and effort to make it a great book and does not rush it to make money faster."
1,Who wrote this book?,"The premise is exceptional. The characters are wonderful, notwithstanding their simplistic treatment. This could have been one of the best reads this summer. I wanted to love this book. What went wrong? Did James Patterson really write this book? I have my doubts"
1,Disappointed,"This was by far the worst book James Patterson has written. I usually love his books but was completely disappointed by ""The Lake"". Felt the storyplot and written language in book was very juvenile. I didn't like the ""Jester"" either.Personally, I wish that Patterson would stick to his Alex Cross stories as they are by far the best."
2,Not the same as the movie!,"I thought I was ordering the book that the movie was based upon. I quickly discovered that I had not. However, I decided to read it anyway. This book is a sequel to another Patterson book. The book was not the usual Patterson quality and was likely an attempt to capitalize on the success of the preceding one."
1,Lake House should be drowned,Patterson's latest attempt at sci-fi mystery is again an example of how bad a book could be written. This book has no real plot and is typical of the downward spiral of this author's work...
1,"Too fast, too bad","I have read the majority of James Patterson's books. I had been a huge fan. It appears with The Lake House that he is simply trying to churn books out too fast which has severely hurt his writing. This book had a transparent plot, if you want to call it a plot. I almost didn't finish the book, but I kept thinking it would get better. It's too bad. I really enjoyed the past Patterson's books and hope this is not a sign of future writings."
1,Just Stupid.,This book was just plain stupid. If it were a kids book and they took out the sex and some of the ridiculous violence then it would be a very stupid kids book. I thought James Patterson lost it with the women's murder club but those are epic suspense and mystery novels compared to this incredibly stupid book. Did I mention that I thought it was just plain stupid?
1,The Lake Farce,"This book was atrocious. I read fairly fast so despite how bad the book is I try to finish. However this book was unreadable. The story line was boring, the characters... shallow. The worst part is the poor sentence structure and vocabulary used by the characters. I rolled my eyes more times than pages."
1,this book is a fraud,"I have read, conservatively, 500 books in my life. From Michener, King, Irving, Vonnegut, Steinbeck, Robert Louis Stevenson, Doulglas Adams, and Lundlum to first time novelists. Classics, Science Fiction, war stories, love stories, satire, farces, historical novels, short stories, you name it. This could be the worst book I have ever read. It is a narritive not a story. Poor character development, no plot twists. Very little reference to anything about a lake house. It is mentioned a few times when the bird kids whine about how they used to live there (presumbably in the prequel to this book). That is it. What a disappointment."
1,The lakehouse fails to soar,"The only thing this story is missing is a good plot, good writing, substance, and round characters. Other than that everything is fine. Now I'll admit that I didn't read the first book, so I was kind of thrown into the whole kids-with-wings previous plot. I only read this book because someone left it at my work. Having just finished a 4,000 page book series, I found the writing to be cheesy and the story to be hurried. I felt like Patterson was holed up at his house trying to make his publisher's deadline, so he just wrote this story with little or no effort. And why does it go from 1st person to 3rd person so much? The characters are incredibly flat (evil docotr Kane who is a mad scientist,i.e.)This is such a disappointment from a writer who gave us Kiss The Girls and Along Came a Spider. Gimme Alex Cross anyday over this waste of time. I want my 6 hours back.Blah."
1,"The Worst Book, Ever","I Can't believe that this book was for sale anywhere. I got it at a book sale for fifty cents and feel that I paid way too . much for it, about 49 cents too much.The plot was stupid, the characters were stupid, and the only reason I finished it was because I was hoping that it would get better. There was no flow in the dialogue, the scenes kept switching without a reason, and the end was gratefully received. That was the first James Patterson book, and probably my last.The one star was only because I had to put at least one in, but really it was a minus."
1,Terrible terrible book,"When I read this I didn't know there had been a prequel, but I don't think it would have made much a difference. The plot was terrible and the dialogue was terrible. I just couldn't buy the whole concept of the children and their powers. It was a while ago when I read this book, but I remember thinking as I read it if the author was serious or whether this book had been written by a teenager. Not sure who the book was directed at, but it wasn't for me."
2,Not Like The Beach House,I just didn't enjoy this and wish I had not paid full price for it.I have found that I don't like his nursery rhyme named books either. I was lucky that I read Beach House first.
1,Don't make this mistake......,"We hardly ever buy books anywhere but Amazon. The reason? Because we get to read the reviews here before we buy. However, one day I was out shopping and saw The Lake House by James Patterson. We have read everything he has written I think (maybe not) so I bought the book. My husband started it last night and today he said ""This might be the worst book I've ever read, do you care if I throw it away"".We have learned our lesson."
5,TOO SHORT,"This book was wonderful, I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately it ended too soon. I finished it in one day! He has a great story line and left it open for other sequels, however, I would have preferred this to be longer."
1,The Lake House,"Major disappointment! After having read WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, I was looking forward to reading this sequel. Though ""the resurrection"" idea would have made a very good book in itself, I felt that the continued storyline of the winged children was far-fetched (and the dialogue just plain silly). Only because I had purchased this book did I make myself finish reading it. I honestly couldn't wait to be done, and, in the end, felt like I had just read an episode from THE POWER RANGERS."
2,All plot with little else.,"This is a weak, comic-bookish Sci-fi tale. Patterson can write much better than this. Oddly, the science is off to the point of silliness. For example, the mad scientist produces copies of himself so he can do many things at once. They are described as clones, but somehow they are mechanical supermen--a head continues to talk, while dangling barely connected at the neck.If you must read this sequel, or everything by Patterson, save your money and get a used copy."
3,its a build up to another book,I think that it was more of a grounds to build a third and final chapter.I cant wait to read the next book.the reason why I feel that way is because there were alot of questions and no answers.I wasnt left hanging but I do feel that there were clues that alot was going to remain unresolved.I love the new approach that patterson is taking with his books.he writing more character driven books which I enjoy.I liked Alex Cross but I was always waiting for the other characters to be given some depth and he has done that with his last few books.STarting with When the Wind Blows.
1,Heather,I think Max isn't the only one that laid an egg. This was a horrible book. It was so bad in so many ways.
4,BEST PATTERSON IN YEARS,"This is Patterson's best book in years. Maybe because he deviates from his formulaic Alex Cross mystery novels. LAKE HOUSE is a sequel to an earlier sci-fi novel, WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, picking up where he left off with a group of genetically engineered children with wings.This book, primarily focuses on two characters, Max the oldest bird girl, and Frannie, the veterinarian who wants to care for her and the other bird children. It begins with the bird children being awarded to the custody of their biological parents. Soon, the evil doctor who created them, Dr. Ethan Kane, returns to collect his progeny. His plot to dominate the world with this scientific findings unfolds.There is nothing offensive in this book. A junior high schooler on up will enjoy this. Just be forewarned, this is not a typical Patterson novel, due to the sci-fi elements of the plot.A good, fast read."
1,Waste of money,"Everyone kept telling me to read James Patterson, so I picked this one up. Oh what a waste of money it was. I have not been so disappointed in a book in a long time. If this is what his other books are like I doubt if I will read another one!!! I tried not to give it a star but unfortunately it wouldn't let me rate it without one."
2,Alex Cross books are much more interesting.....,"I am a fairly new reader of Patterson's books and do have to agree with other reviewers that the Alex Cross thrillers are far more interesting. The dialog in ""The Lake House"" was quite basic (and sometimes unrealistic). I made the mistake of reading this first, not sure if it is now worth reading the story from the beginning (When The Wind Blows, the pre-quel)."
1,Complete rubbish!,"Kids that can fly? What the..?! I can't think of a respectable way to discard this book. Burning it is a waste of a good match. I wouldn't line my bird's cage with it! Don't EVEN bother buying, borrowing or reading this book! One star is way too much. Zero wasn't an option!"
2,fluff,I didn't care for this book at all. It was nothing like his other books that I have read ( I had not read the prequel to this one). I felt it was like a Robin Cook or Michael Crighton novel instead of a James Patterson. Very cheesy.
2,Bring back Alex Cross and the Mystery Stories,"""When The Wind Blows"" was a thriller about genetically engineered children kept in cages by the evil doctors. The kids had wings and could fly. In ""The Lake House"" the same kids are back involved in a tedious custody battle between their natural parents whom they had never known and the Veterinarian who had helped, along with Kit Brennan the FBI agent, to rescue them. The story is basically strange kids growing up and silly.The Alex Cross books written by Mr. Patterson were his best literary efforts. When the Wind Blows sold a lot of books so on came the sequel. The result was a watered down version of a once successful book. It would be great to see the original suspense of the Cross series come back."
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read,"actually I'm sorry to say I bought the audio tapes and am furious that I wasted good money on such drivel! I didn't like the first in the series and didn't realize this was a sequel until the first couple of sentences. Altho disappointed, I thought I'd continue to listen during my daily work commute as an alternative to talk radio. After a couple of hours, it became a chore, after a couple of days, I was only listening for the comic value of this inane waste of good audio tape! Not only is the basis of the novel completely farcical, the dialoge is ridiculous and the writing itself asinine.Only reason I'm giving it 1 star is because it's the lowest rating available - otherwise, it would get NEGATIVE STARS!"
1,Lousy sequel,"Downright painful to read. This is a sequel to When The Wind Blows-- which was a fairly entertaining genetics/FBI adventure. In this ""continuation"", which has very little to do with the original story line, the characters do not even sound or act anything like they did in the first story. There are about 10 pages worth of story here, padded with a whole bunch of 3-page chapters of filler. There's not even a reason to bring the flying children back, as they have no link to this story, but apparently if ""kid jep"" sells once, it will sell again. Sappy, disconnected, and hard to care about the outcome. Don't waste your time- read something by Crichton or Cook instead."
2,Would have been great with much more detail.,"James Patterson's books either get into the good stuff, or breeze by so quick that you wondered how long did it take him to write this book. This book definately falls into the quickly written category. The story could have had so much more detail, and consistency.Overall, the follow on story takes you further in the winged flyers lives, but ties it in with the current plot twist. The two stories don't comingle well, and are loosely thrown together to attempt a connection.For a quick read it's a decent book, but I'd recommend buying it as a used paperback. Or better yet, borrowing it from a friend."
1,Really bad.,"This was the first James Patterson book I have ever read and it was terrible. The writing was simplistic and seemed almost to be written as a teen mystery. The story just dropped off and picked up willy nilly. The characters got out of difficult situations just by getting out of them ... that's it. It just happens. Really, really bad."
1,Save your money,"it's 2:49 AM And I just thought about the lake house, alright listen to me here, i'm just extremely angered by the ending...the ending the ending OH GOD THE ENDING WAS GARBAGE PLEASE OH PLEASE ....SOMEBODY KILL ME I'M READING THE FIVE STAR REVIEWS AND I'M LAUGHING LIKE HELL HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE? SAVE YOUR MONEY DON'T BUY THE BOOK. Caps lock off..."
4,+ 1/2 stars...Excellent Intro to Texas Blues Man,"Anson Funderburgh's solo career begins its twenty-fifth year with this well chosen anthology. It includes tracks from his Black Top debut TALK TO YOU BY HAND (""Come On"") through his latest on Rounder's Bullseye Blues WHICH WAY IS TEXAS? (""Rambling Woman"").Most of these tracks feature Sam Myers on vocals/harmonica. The now seventy-year-old Myers (who has worked with such blues giants as Elmore James) joined the band in 1986. In addition, Myers is a fine songwriter (""I Done Quit Getting Sloppy Drunk"" and ""My Heart Cries Out for You"" on this anthology). [Trivia alert: That's Beavis and Butt-head creator Mike Judge on bass on the opening track. He was a member of the Rockets from 1987-1990.]This is an excellent update of 1992's anthology THRU THE YEARS. My only complaint is that BLAST OFF duplicates eleven of those songs. But overall, this is a throughly enjoyable and satisfying collection of this modern Texas blues artist. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,A book of worksheets...,"This book does NOT teach you how to organize an event. It is less than 55 pages (big print and mostly forms). This event planner does not agree with the author's advice to write your goal statement at the very end of the planning process. I believe the purpose statement and objectives shape how your meeting or event is organized.While this booklet does have a number of forms/worksheets you can photocopy and use, they are not very detail oriented and their small size makes them impractical for use in your actual event notebook (you'll most likely want to recreate them on your computer). There may be better resources available but because this booklet is offered for (...), you should get at least that amount of value from it."
3,Need update for some examples in the book.,You will be disappointed if you are using Windows ME or 2000 Profession on your machine and you will find the screens related to the topics on the book is different. But it is good for learning the basics about the related topics with the book.
3,Beavis and Butthead on the go!,This game is actually quite fun. It sticks to the storylines of the cartoon series and has the potential to make you laugh. Try it out.
3,"Overall, this was a good cookbook with basic recipes","I thought this would be an interesting cookbook after see Ms. Labelle on ""The Oprah Show"" giving demonstrations of a few of the recipes in which she had given very unique names to some of them. Over-the-Rainbow Macaroni and Cheese, Wicked Peach Cobbler, Screamin' Mean Greens, Make-You-Wanna-Holler Maryland Crab Cakes were just a few of the unique names. Even though some of the dishes were secret recipes, there wasn't really anything that was very different from what I'd seen in other cookbooks. I thought Ms. Labelle kind of boasted a little to much about how great the recipes were, but I didn't find anything so spectacular about any of them. The recipe for Jackie's Fried Egg Sandwich was very basic but said that her sister didn't want anybody's egg sandwich except hers. The stories that went along with most of the recipes were interesting and overall made this a good cookbook."
1,Very Disappointed,"I am a very detailed oriented person, so I followed three of her recipes very carefully. And guess what, all three of them were a complete flop. I still can't get over her recipe for cooking dressing on the stovetop. Now that was my biggest flop."
3,"fine, but you can do better","I had this shredder for about 3 years and it just died today after I put too many papers in at once (the motor still seems to be working, but won't suck any papers in any longer and the owner's manual is of no help for this).Pros: It's cheap.Cons: Loud. (As in, wakes-the-neighbors loud.) Doesn't take more than a few sheets at a time. Jams frequently and makes scary noises.Since shredders are the sort of thing that you'll need forever, I think it's worth investing a bit more and getting a higher-quality product. At least, that's my plan . . ."
1,Revisionist History at It's Finest!,"Though full of half-truths and self-promoting propaganda, this book does provide a glimpse into the twisted, egotistical psyche that is Hillary Clinton. Prior to reading this book, I felt that Hillary was an evil person, bent on doing harm to our country. A scary thought, but easily countered. Now, I see that, in her heart, she actually believes that her vision for our country is just. That thought is simply terrifying! Had Thoreau seen Hillary coming, he surely would have turned and run away..."
4,Very Interesting,"[...] This is an extremely interesting book by an incredibly interesting person. It's a good read if you want to know about what goes on in the inside.Should she be president? I'm certainly not sure yet, but the concervative [people] writing non-reviews would only want you to hear their side of history. Powell, the liar, in my opinion, who says that letting corporations own all the radio/tv/and newspapers in a market, is changing those rules for the ""benefit"" of the American people, is like these other people who are sewing up the peoples' voices. Look at the complete [person], in my opinion, Michael Savage, who, again in my constitutionally protected opinion, [...] he wants to shut off the websites of people who have a different take on his views. When it comes to conservatives, their motto isn't ""the more the merrier.""Anne [...] Coulter wrote her version, now hear it from the horse's mouth.[...] Buy this Book!"
1,Not at this time....,"It's interesting. I read her book out of fear. I'll admit I don't like the chick. It was interesting how she feels that she manipulated things for her own gain, but missed her husband getting happy with an intern. How is that even possible. Back to the book... It stinks. Please. On Larry King she was asked if she was going to run for President. Her response... The same one she gave while first lady when she was asked about running for any office. Hillary is good at two things... Revisionism and Manipulation."
1,TERRIBLE!,"This book, if anything, can only help the Republican party. Hillary proves to be a complete idiot, and her boring recollection of life as first lady tells us nothing new. It's the same bull we heard the first time around.Don't waste your money!!"
1,oof,"As a one-time supporter of both Hillary and Bill, I have become accustomed over the last 5 years to the bleak, desolate feeling of my world crumbling around me. I thought that the destruction was over and that I may at long last begin rebuilding my world on a foundation of sanity. But once again, a Clinton bleats out another affront that hits me like a shot in the gut.This book is repugnant. I had hoped for a mea culpa - an apology - an acknowledgement of what she and her husband did to the country over the years. There is none of this. It is revolting, disgusting tripe, nothing more than a pile of simple lies served up for simpletons to savor. The person who suggested that this woman is twisted was dead-on. She needs medication and therapy. There is no limit to the destruction this woman would wreak on human beings if left to her own devices, absent the corrective measure of that which she abhors, the vote."
2,A disappointment,"It seems most people, like me, expected some genuine personal insight into Hillary's life and mind with this book. As it turns out, she seems to be targeting an audience that wants dullness -- dullness as a security blanket, to confirm that she is not a broken, disgraced, or hysterical wife, but rather a staid, ponderous politician. And ponderous describes this book perfectly. Most of it is genuinely uninteresting, and it is difficult to read through in its entirety."
3,A poorly read encompssing a very important time in history,I wish Hillary had used a professional writer for this biography that encompasses a most difficult time in modern history...an account of Bill Clinton's youthful success as the governor of Arkansas to becoming the president and going down with Monica Lewinsky.Most of the time it seems that Hillary has just put her daily diary together but the part where she has to deal with the personal trauma of Bill's infidelity is very moving.
2,"Please, make it stop!","The book blathers on and on about mundane details of no significance. The marketing hype on this book was stunning, a publicist's dream, but unfortunately, there is no substance.Nothing on Whitewater, the rumored assanations, Bill's antics, nothing. Either the writer of the book didn't know what to ask, or the questions were ignored."
1,UNBELIEVABLE ability to lie and lie and lie...,"This is the typical liberal/Democratic Party hogwash that Hillary (or her ghost writer) and Bill, along with the rest of the Democratic Party, have tried to feed Americans for the last thirty years! Even with Hillary, she takes no personal responsibility. It's always the other (Republican) guy's fault! She makes that clear in her book. She expects us to believe that although smoke was found in every ""room"" of her life, there was no fire. Aside from her personal scandals (all of which were formulated by a right-wing conspiracy), her ideology clearly aligns her with the likes of Marx, Lenin, and other communists/socialists. I don't think she is ashamed of that! Worthless life, worthless book."
1,Living Her Story,"In a word, this book was not interesting. I pride myself for having read many autobiographies. This book just lost me.I think it takes a ghost writer instead of just a village."
1,Her facial expression on the cover says it all,"The author of Living History has grandiose goals for the future. Read her book and see if this elitist/ actress/ anti-semite (do the research) will lead America down the path to secular wasteland. I thought she was smart too, but then I read the book."
1,A Bad Christmas Present,"There are better ways of spending your money for a rare, limited edition copy of a book or some other rare item. How about buying a mint Leica M6 TTL Titanium 35mm rangefinder camera? Surely it would be a better financial investment for Christmas and many new years to come than a signed limited edition copy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's ""Living History"". Or if a rare book published by Simon and Schuster would be more appealing to you, I would recommend instead trying to find a first edition copy of Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes"". Again, it would be a better financial investment than purchasing a copy of Ms. Clinton's tome. Unfortunately her distorted view of her personal history - and her husband's - is not worth the paper it is printed on."
1,Nothing new and a bunch of half-truths. YUCK!,"This books sheds no new light on the ""Eight Years of Darkness"" known as the Clinton administration. The background on Hillary is shotty at best and offers no perspective on who this woman really is. If this was meant to pave the way for an eventual run at the White House, it falls completely short.Save your money."
2,"A chronicle of current events, little personal insight.","This book has no soul. Senator Clinton puts in no emotion, no wit, no insight, no personal details to mold the story. We are presented with a bullet list of events that happened during Bill Clinton's presidency. The only area where she shows some emotion is Chelsea -- and even there, Chelsea is portrayed as a perfect daughter, who can do no wrong. I would recommend reading Madeleine Albrights autobiography instead if you are interested in the events of this period. Hers is a lot more enjoyable and does not leave you feeling like you have read the archives of the New York Times."
1,Propoganda,"First of all,let me state I am a democrat.Secondly,I am ashamed of what the Clintons have done to the democrat party and the low ,sleazy political tactics they have made acceptable in todays politics.Third, Amazon.com should be ashamed of itself for not warning people before clicking on a cover enlargement that the viewer may toss their cookies at the site of Hillary Clinton occupying a third of their browser screen.Skip this book.Garbage."
1,Why is this novel in the Nonfiction category?,Can not decide if I was reading a novel or what ever is known of the woman is as deceiving as she is. Never made it to the end - stopped at 1/3 of the book.
5,Go Hillary!,"This book already deserves 5+ stars just to balance out the garbage published by other ""commenting"" customers, who really believe the lies, lies, lies sold to them by the rotten Bush administration."
1,My only regret about this book...,"...is that there isn't a rating lower than one star. What junk. This is the most self-serving, egocentric book it will ever be your displeasure to lay your eyes on. Don't waste your time."
1,Rewriting History,"While most events and persons in Clinton's book are recognizable, this book really belongs in the fiction department. If you want history, look elsewhere for something less biased and sanitized. If you want fiction, there are countless better-written works out there."
4,Stick to the Tabloids!,"(...) A book for intelligent people who care about this country - just like Hillary Clinton. She has done more and worked harder for women, children etc. So many people I know sit at their desk all day, then go home and watch Survivor or some such drivel. Meanwhile, even from a young age Hillary was involved in the community and fighting for causes she believed in. How can so many say this is fiction? There are pictures of her throughout her life working for what she believes in."
1,What a load of ...,"This spin of the facts is so outragous that it makes Hillary look like a total fool. Only a woman with low self-esteem and low self value would take the repeated wandering of her husband and still claim that she believed his lies. The authors (Hillary did not write the book 3 others did) toot the Clinton's horn taking credit for anything good that happened in the world and while they ignore all the harm that was caused by the Clintons. What we all really wanted to know was why all of the busness partners were put in jail, and what happened to all the things stolen from the White house when they left in a huff. Save your money this book is not worth the paper it is writen on. 8 million bucks? what a rip.........."
1,well written? Who wrote it?,"I found this book to be in the ""fiction"" catagory. No substance, all style, and what the ""author"" thinks the liberal left would like to read. It was painful to get through. From the few positive reviews and the reviewers' other recommendations, it seems to have worked!I found the ""well written"" comments interesting. The grammer and style is OK, but Hillary certainly didn't WRITE this.Save your money."
1,NOT the face that lauched a thousand ships.,This ugly toad has been a pain in the collective butt of Americans for far to long. If you have seen her face you have read the book. I wish the old bat would do the world a favor and just croak.
5,A BOOK FOR EVERY WOMAN,"Smart, savy, and really well written. This book is an intimate (but not excessively intimate) glimpse into the heart and mind of a brilliant woman who has surmounted an incredible amount of hateful criticism, gossip and innuendo. Her wisdom and dignity remain untarnished. I am recommending this autobiography to every thoughtful woman I know."
1,Pure revisionism and propaganda,"The lies of omission in this book are insulting to the intelligence of even a casual follower of Hillary's career. Seems she's eager to step on anyone's face for political gain, eh Bill?"
2,Living or is it really dead history,"What a throughly disappointing book, I expected a book about the revolutionary principles that people like me, stalin, and such recent hall of famers as tom haden, and kucinich have embodied...but noooooo!!Instead we get a book about living history. Well Hilary I think you should retrace your liberal roots and return to the party that really loves you.Kudos, and remember to my help my dear friend howard dean, for today the senate tommorrow the world!!!"
1,Incredible read,"Its incredibel that the american people can read this kind of ""literature"" well, a ""garbage literature"" please show your culture and dont give your money to people that doesnt make nothing for you when they can."
3,why bother to read the book,I read through many of the reviews for Hillary's book. I absolutely do not believe that most of the people who reviewed the book (especially the people who say it is full of lies) actually bothered to read the book. They were sure in a hurry to review it. Most seem to just want another opportunity to bash the Clintons in print.
3,...MORE FROM HILLARY'S SPIN DOCTORS,Living History simply put is Hillary's new high horse. Hillary actually had very little to do with this publication. She and her political strategists figured out how they wanted to spin the troublesome events of her power driven life and hired the best ghost writers to make her sound passionate and likeable. I must admit they succeed and obviously are very good at what they do. Interesting enough to read to see just how they skate in and around the sensitive topics. However in the end its simply too much to take this book as the honest truth...Sorry Hil
1,"Same Old, Same Old","Thank goodness I didn't pay for this rehashing of old tales. I borrowed it from a woman I work with who couldn't finish it after a week of trying. I muddled through it over two long evenings and came away wondering if I had better spent my time shampooing the carpets. Nothing new, nothing informative, nothing enlightening. Just the same old, same old."
5,Fascinating!,LIVING HISTORY is a fascinating biography of of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her family. I found her to be both candid and humorous and appreciated the insider view of her time in the White House.
1,Makes a good fire!,If you feel that this book is a must buy then read it. After you finish the first 2 pages ( if you can get that far) you'll come to your senses and you'll save the garbage men the extra weight in the garbage bag and just throw it in the fire.
2,Just a rehash of things better forgotten.,"I really expected this to have a lot more depth than it does. I also found a number of parts where I really have to question the forthright honesty because of well known facts that are in direct conflict with her version of events.The part I really dislike about this book is it's timing. Here our party is trying to come up with a contender able to kick the dummy out of office, yet all the media is talking about is Hillary's book and that tramp Bill was caught with. I just really wish the Clintons would step back a little, if she isn't going to run for president, and let new leaders emerge in the Democrat party and have a voice in the media. With Bill's book due to come out next year, I fear that the Democrat party candidate will be smothered right out of the election."
1,Waste of money and time!,"This was passed on to me by a friend who couldn't finish it. I am an avid reader and seldom put down a book without finishing it, but I couldn't finish this one either. Poorly written, same old refrains and hysterical undertones. Definitely not straighforward and honest. Much of what I read was totally unbelievable. Don't waste your money!"
2,Nelson Mandela & Harry Potter,Nelson Mandela wouldn't come to wife's mind if I committed adultery. Pure political diatribe. I now know why Harry Potter and Living History are both #1 & 2. They are both about witchcraft.
5,Great Rare Find,"I really loved it. However, some of her chapters are spent on her foreign trips to South America and Africa. Those not very interesting. But, overall the books stays on point, provides an excellent explanation of Whitewater, Travelgate, and filegate. I guess all I can write is this-Clinton/O'Bama '08"
3,"CHEESY POLITICAL FOOTNOTES ASIDE, VERY WELL-WRITTEN","Whoever edited the book for Ms Clinton has done a very competent job, it reads very smooth. Some moments particularly in the first quarter of the book (which itself is a novella) from her childhood and teenage years are fascinating, stuff that transcends ""American way of life"" as the back cover panderingly claims.I'll intentionally skip the bit on politics, of which there is more than an endurable share, but even through those laborious sections, Ms. Clinton's stories maintain a cultured yet light-hearted flavor, e.g., her descriptions of life in the White House or her handling of her husband's peccadilloes.All in all a significantly more pleasant experience than the hernia-inducing tome from Mr. Clinton. Definitely worth a read, it's not just a political tirade."
3,Thank You Melissa McIlmail,"Yes, the book is bland, but Mrs. Clinton is indeed living history, she has her place in the history books and so do others much less deserving. History is being made all the time, it's good to see someone who is aware of the fact that she is indeed making history, whether you like her or not. And the comment about Howdy Doody, hey, Bush's mug isn't on this cover?!"
5,usefull guide for visitor,"The visitor from Europe will be dismayed by the limited public access to the shoreline , but this book will help you to make the best of it."
4,where's paul's book,"Just finished this book and enjoyed it very much,as I was reading the writing style was very similar to howard sterns private parts(another biography i enjoyed). It gave me an insite to gene who was my favorite member when I was a kid. It seemed like a honest perspective and help me understand why they seem like the commercial whores sometimes (because they are!!) and even if Gene hated Ace and Peter and thought they were pain in the asses I still love this band (in every incarnation). The biggest question is when is Pauls book comming out??!!"
2,Gene propaganda,"This book is only for die-hard Kiss fans who must have everything the band puts out. I have been a fan since I was six, so naturally I was curious to see what ""truth"" Gene had to tell about the band. I was incredibly disappointed in his writing. Not only did he not reveal anything most fans do not already know, he glosses over the death of Eric Carr and many other events. This book just reinforces what I have been feeling over the last few years-that he only cares for the fans if they spend their money on the merchandise. Kiss is a company now, not the BAND I grew up with."
1,How could a guy in KISS write such a dull book?,"That's my question? How could he-a man who has been in rock and roll for over 30 years-write such a boring book? The chapters basically repeat themselves: 1)I was a poor jewish kid raised by only my mother; 2)I don't drink or smoke, but I sleep with anything slightly resembling a woman; 3)Peter and Ace were always trouble-be it alcohol or drugs-but I didn't want to fire them. As for his relationships with Cher and Diana Ross, People magazine wrote better articles. P.S. Does Paul know what Gene wrote about him? That was the only interesting part of a paper wasting, so-called autobiography."
1,What a waste of paper!,"I have always been a big fan of Kiss and I followed them through the years( even the terrible ones!). I can remember saving up every dime so I could buy my Kiss records in the 70's. Well, after reading this book I feel like the biggest idiot in the world. Gene Simmons shows to be nothing more than a greedy, arrogant man who thinks he is the greatest thing to hit music. ... Do not waste your money on this or any other Kiss related item. I can tell you the whole book in 1 sentence. Gene hates Peter and Ace because they do not listen to him and He hooked up with some ladies... The book rambles on with story after story about the band. Only to be interupted in mid-thought about a woman he had sex with. The book in terrible and it makes you realize that all of those years of music were for only one thing! MONEY! Well, you have gotten my last dime you blood sucker!"
3,"Interesting read, but could have been better","I enjoyed reading the first part of the book, particularly about Gene's childhood, and the early influences in his life. His repetitive and endless use of the phrase ""chasing skirt"" becomes old rather quickly. He also rails on Ace and Peter endlessly, which is okay with me, because they probably deserve it--after all, they were not doing what was in the best interest of KISS...but when I read about Gene's Hollywood lifestyle and other side endeavors, I couldn't help but question whether Gene was putting KISS first either, so his bashing of Ace and Peter lost some credibility with me. All in all, it's a decent read, but would have been better if Gene hired someone to polish it up a bit.Ironically, when I finished the book, I had more respect and admiration for Paul than anyone else. I hope he will write his own autobiography someday."
4,Well written; entertaining; amusing!,"I've been a heavy metal, rock-n-roll fan since I was in junior high (late '60s). I liked KISS when they came upon the scene in the early '70s but never enough to really buy their albums. Again, I would listen to them on the radio and like some of their music but not all of it. Nevertheless, after reading this book, I've come to appreciate their music more than before.Simmons has written an honest look at the lives of KISS. His writings come across as sincere with respect to the problems KISS experienced with Ace and Peter. This is what makes rock-n-roll books interesting. I've come away with a greater appreciation of Gene Simmons as an entrepreneur. I never would have expected that by looking at him while playing in KISS!Not that I'll go out and by their albums now, but I will listen to them on XM Radio with a greater interest. The book is very entertaining and certainly worth space on your music library shelf."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING.....,"As a lifelong KISS fan, I've always followed their every move, in good times and bad. So it was with great anticipation that I awaited Gene Simmons' book. Obviously, he is intelligent and well spoken, but also brash and full of himself (as he will readily admit!). While the book is good and entertaining in many places, I just expected more. We know the whole story about the women, the money, etc. He takes every opportunity to attack bandmates Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, and it comes across as pretty one sided. I'm not sure what I expected exactly...maybe more info or thoughts from him that I haven't seen or heard in countless interviews over the years. A good book but just a little disappointing."
4,"Simmons is a God, but a humble one???","After 30 years he finally admits how much he cares about only himself and no one else. This alone garnishes 4 stars!! The merchandising (sell-out) has found another way to empty our pocketbooks, but this is a good read. I've read the other biographies on Kiss and wondered if his own words would tell the truth, or pull the wool over the eyes of the die-hard fans that he claims to be ""the only people that matter."" I have to admit that I enjoyed the book. Even the pictures were good. I hate when (he) gets my attention."
1,speaker broken,"I don't expect much from $20 walkie-talkies, but one of the units had a broken speaker right out of the package! And the process for replacing/repairing is worthless since it's sold through an Amazon affiliate, not Amazon itself."
1,NO CHARGERS INCLUDED,What are we supposed to do with a fleet of of walkie talkies that don't come with chargers???
3,I like it but...,"We bought this for our 4yr old so that he and his friend (our neighbor)could talk from porch to porch. It works well. The only problem is the push to talk button is hard for him to push. I wouldn't reccomend it for young children, they just dont have the strength in their hand/thumb to hold the button down."
3,"fun for kids, but not huge range","This walkie talkie set is perfect for kids because it doesn't have many buttons. The range, however, is not 5 miles."
5,Top Quality Bird Book,"This guide is wonderful! Each bird is clearly pictured in full color while a map shows its range. A three-paragraph description of each bird is supplemented by recognition points, habitat, nest description, and the bird's food preferences.Although each bird gets a full page, the types are grouped so one can flip through looking at similar birds. The groupings include birds of prey, large land birds, smaller open country birds, smaller woodland birds, ducklike birds, gull-like birds, large wading birds, and shorebirds.Reader's Digest maintains its reputation for producing colorful, useful books for the home reference library."
2,disappointing,"This product arrived quickly, and appeared unbroken, but never would connect my firewire products with a live connection. It seemed to fit the holes, but simply didn't bring the external hard drive on to my desktop. I was very disappointed."
3,"A fragile tent, a hut for the baby","It is easy to assemble and dissemble. Ingenious: sticks with elastic straps inside them.It is fragile. The wind knocks if off immediately. My baby likes to stand up, and for doing that, he holds one of the walls and pushes himself onto it so that he can stand up. So, I have to sit him down every time he attempts this because he will fall over inside the tent making it to roll somehow. Lots of fun right there, but I did not buy this for this kind of fun.It is very frugally made, but it is something you can carry easily, assemble easily, you can isolate your kid in to play with toys, even leave your kid sleep inside.So, it is a an OK-Good item. It serves your purpose. Besides, the colors are fun, the fabric protects from sun (need to move that side after the sun).I still have it, still use it, so, it is a good buy after all."
1,Navitas Goji Berries - Made in China,"I was really excited to try these and then when I opened the bag I was thoroughly disappointed. They don't smell like they would be dried berries; in fact they smell more earthy than berry-ish. Himalayan superfruit the package says.... These berries have barely any taste at all. I did not enjoy them. Then of course I pan around to ingredients and notice ""product of China"". I know the Himalayas run to China but still, why is it that it seems almost everything comes from China now? Given their terrible enforcement for quality control in everything across the board, including food production, I don't want to be eating any product coming out of China. Their terrible quality water supply and even worse air quality are enough for me to frown on anything edible coming from China. Not to mention their consistent history for allowing chemically tainted foods to be consumed by their population."
1,Not this brand. They made me sick.,"Two times, a week apart, for no apparent reason other than snacking on this product, I became violently ill. I researched the potential side effects and becoming violently ill is not supposed to be one of them. I cannot return the bag for a refund (thanks, Amazon) so I have to throw it out. I will be trying another brand soon."
2,is it dry or moist?,the bag is different than what i had last time. last time is dry and crunchy. this time is moist and not all dry at all.not sure what it suppose to be.. there is no standard???
2,"Chewy, not soft","These are okay. I expected them to be sweet, but they're not. I put them in my cereal and they're kind of tough to chew."
1,"Extremely disappointed, dry and brittle compared to other brands I've tried","I'm extremely disappointed with these berries. I gave them a 1 star, however, if I was allowed I wouldn't have given any stars. I usually get Heaven Mountain berries and thought I would try these because they can be included as part of a free shipping order. Big mistake on my part. These berries are dry and brittle and have a slightly bitter taste. The others that I usually get (heaven ones) are moister plumper and have a sweeter flavor. Do yourself a favor and get something other than these. You can get the Heaven Mountain ones from a partner company with Amazon - Vitacost. It would be nice if they were listed here. Anyway, be forewarned.Cheers"
5,great tasting long lasting energy and sickness fighting,i ordered these goji berrys and they came very quick i was afraid that they would have mold on them after reading all the other reviews... but i found no mold on my berrys they were in perfect condition.. they tasted great.. crunchy and sweet.. eating the berrys everyday i noticed i got sick allot less and i had allot more energy.. not only that but my mood improved too this fruit is great i love it so much i planted my own goji bush's at home... intel those bear fruit im satisfied with navitas goji berrys..and i love that there price is so good.. i mean does a 16 0unce of goji realy have to cost 25-30 dollars..overall this product was great
4,Good for you... but pretty tasteless/bland,"I eat this only for the nutritional value, not for taste. I blend them in with my smoothie in the morning so I do not even notice their taste at all. They definitely do not taste sweet or are a delicious snack to have on hand like raisins or dried apricots.I read results of people finding leaves in their bags or something like that.... and I did not have this problem at all.Overall, this is a good health food investment, as they pump up the nutritional value in my morning shakes!"
2,Not very tasty,"I was really excited to try these as I like dried fruits. I know that they have great health benefits, but these don't taste very good at all. I thought they would be semi sweet and I would like to enjoy snacking on them. Unfortunately, I find them to be rather bitter and just not very good tasting. I will eat them because they are a healthy super food, but it's definitely something I would turn to when I have cravings for a tasty snack."
2,Highly Allergic!,"We ordered these to use in our nutribullet shakes. Large bag for a very reasonable price. Turned out we were Highly Allergic to these berries. My husband and I both ended up with a horrible rash, also know as HIVES! No thank you."
4,pretty good,"i bought the xbox about a year ago and its worked fine untill a few weeks ago, when I turn it on i have to hit it to get the tray to come out and sometimes it wont turn on its been pretty fun but it didnt last very long. i only played it 3 or 4 times a week"
1,Not Pleased,"I was not pleased with this product because it worked fine for the first 2 weeks, but then the x-box started saying that it couldn't read my discs, even if they were brand new. I will never buy from this seller again."
3,"Too much hype, not enough games","The Xbox could have left Nintendo and Sony in the dust if it just had a wider variety of games. There are only about three Xbox-only games with notable enjoyment. The rest of the games are low-budget side games with no story. All of this hype about better graphics is a lie. You can see blocky images on the screen and jagged lines. Specs don't mean anything if you don't have the good, fun, and engaging games to back it up. It is not worth the $200(you even have to buy a separate device to play DVD's. Why is it 200 dollars?). It also takes a long time on some games to load to the next level or startup."
3,Not a bad console.,"Okay, Good points: It's quick and well priced.(after 5 years)Bad Points, it's makes weird noises after it's first year out in kiddie land. Not as many games as PS2.Of course if you haven't played Halo, then this is where you stop, get to a shop and buy the damn machine! With Halo 2 coming out soon, you would NEED it in your home as quick as possible."
3,buyers beware,"even thou xbox is the greatest for there graphics- there system doesn't hold up and needs to be replace or repair within 1 yr or so, depending on how much you play it???? DIFFIDENTLY BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY beleive me if you don't you'll be sorry. microsoft wants $79.00 plus shipping to refabe it. i'd go w/ playstation but too much money wrapped up already in xbox.GOOD LUCK"
5,First time Xboxer,"After playing zillions of games on my computers for years,I decided to try out a console,and,after lots of research and hands-on play,I got the Xbox.I set it up in about 5 minutes and started playing""Van Helsing"" right away.I have never used a game pad contoller,so I got killed about 40 times before I could understand the function of each button.I know you kids out there are rolling your eyes,but I am used to using a mouse,so it took a while before I caught on.The graphics are astounding,as is the sound.I was amazed at the depth of detail in each area.Anyway...I am new to this,yes,but I am very pleased I got it. I did have to call the support dept. and get a little help,and the young man helping me couldn't have been nicer and more patient.That's always a plus as far as I'm concerned.I am completely satisfied with this purchase,and also amazon's extremely fast delivery!"
4,Xbox - Gift,"I ordered the Xbox as a gift and I arrived and worked fine out of the box. The unit is really nice, but I don't have any experence with the other like units out there. I would recommend this to anyone that likes video games."
2,XBOX system,"I cannot believe how many people worship this. It's definetly not worth the hype. Sure, the graphics chip is capable of a lot of great graphics, but guess what? They hardly use it. The controller isn't nearly as comfortable as the PS2s. And there are more fun (and better) games on GameCube. Not to mention how many better games there are for PS2. I have all 3 systems. Xbox is by far the worst. Oh, and Halo ISN'T NEARLY AS GOOD AS EVERYONE SAYS IT IS! Best FPS on xb but thats not saying alot. Maybe that's why so many people worship it: it's the only shooter that they could play. There's infinite lives, you can't die. On the upside there are games like morrowind and fable that you can't find on any other console and there is a hard drive (the first console to have one). A very tiny hd but nevertheless..."
2,A semi-decent computer alternative,"I purchased this system due to a ""gotta have it"" factor. A shame I didnt need it. To keep this review short, if you consider yourself a true gamer, stay away. If you cant afford a computer, this is a semi-decent alternative to some PC gaming fun.PS2 and the 'Cube basically own the market in every genre except for the ones an individual would typically only find on the PC, usually for some very obvious reasons...and those obvious reasons are the Xbox's inherit flaws.Do you know what I am talking about? If not, then you are one of the many who will find this gaming experience ""new"" and ""unique"". Get this system, you'll love it."
4,X BOX STINKS,My Father bought me x box for christmas. I played it alot. Now i am blind. x BOX killed my eye sight. DO NOT BUY IT!!!! SAVE YOUR CHILDREN. by the way i have a brail computer. PLEASE DO NOT BUY X BOX!!!!
3,Great for some time,"Xbox is a great console and extremly fun to play on it. The only constant problem is that the console doesn't work well for too long. The warranty is only for 90 days so after that if it breaks you have to pay $80 + shipping to fix it. My first console broke so I bought a new one. To my surprise the new one broke just a few days after the warranty had expired. It sometimes works though, but even when it does it sometimes freezes.Overall I like the Xbox, but had too many problems with it."
2,To bad the XBox lasted only two months,"When I bought the XBox on 6-11-06 it came at a very good rate of time, my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke I don't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months. I can't say the person that sold me the XBox has even tried to email me since I've emailed him , hmmmm."
1,XBOX is not durable,Just 2 years and each year several days then it became a piece of junk.The flashing green and red button is the only thing that can work.I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM MICROSOFT.It is so soft and micro!!!
5,A gaming system that you have to have,For my birthday I got a lot of presents. I also got a lot of money too. I was looking to get a new game system because PSone was going out and I can't stick to playing hand held games forever. Then my uncle suggested that get the best gaming system in the world. XBOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My mom and I went to toysrus one week after my birthday to get the most ultimate gaming system in the world.My xbox is so cool. It came with two games that I love. The first thing that I do in the mornng is play my xbox. It comes with this built in memory so you don't have to worry about memory cards. It has some great games too! When get bord on Saturday night I put on a movie on my xbox. You need the playback kit to do that (Sold Separtley) In conclusion: Xbox is coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool!
3,brutal honest truth,its all about sex and money baby...this contains great advice..recommended by david deangelo..great dating coach..watch blueprint decoded by tyler durden top class..
3,"Good for Kiss fans, little interest to anyone else","Gene's 2nd book is not nearly as interesting as his first one, Kiss and Make Up. While his previous book is more of an autobiography and history of his band, Sex Money Kiss focuses on his love of cash and hatred of marriage. There is nothing really new or exciting to be found here, just rehashing in more detail his opinions regarding women and money. This book is for the true Kiss die-hrad fan or Gene Simmons fanatics only."
3,Gene Simmons - Sex Money KISS book review,"Gene misses the point a bit in this book. Life is about being healthly and happy, not about being rich. I do agree that money helps...alot, but Gene assumes that we would all enjoy working 7 days a week earning ""CASH"". Clearly working is how me enjoys himself but i'd say that most of us would not. He suggests not watching sports or taking vacations because you could be earning money....it's not gonna happen Gene.He is however spot on with the asset risk caused by marriage and with the reality about men's tendancy to stray.An interesting read but I won't be taking all his advice."
5,A must read book for people interested in Krishna!,"I grew up in the Christian religion but am trying to convert to Hinduism. I loved this book. It made me laugh out loud. It brought tears to my eyes. It excited me. It made me love Krishna. This book is excellent for someone devoted to Krishna or just for someone that is interested in Hindu ""folklore"". The stories are very well told and the book is full of ""morals"" to describe why Krishna made things happen as they did. It gave me an excellent understanding of Krishna's life and how he thinks. I will forever see little Krishna stealing the butter, loving his devotees, and fighting a battle. There is a lot of the religion aspects of this, so it is for someone that is interested in learning the religion and not just the stories. I understood the wording of the religous teachings and they touched me. And I also enjoyed the stories like any novel. This is a must read book for anyone interested in Krishna. Hare Krishna!"
5,this book,"i like this book, its got a lot of no brainers like you should drink plenty of water, but also some helpful lists and information. im vegan and i still make plenty of junk food, but ive taken a lot of tips from this book that have made me feel good, like quitting soda (or any drink with added sugar)"
1,Misleading,"I thought this book was going to help me make wise diet choices in a humorous way. Although it started out that way, the book ended up being an argument for veganism."
2,Eghhhhhhh.........,"This book is misleading....First of all, the reader does not find out that the authors are vegetarians until the 4th chapter, where they change from talking about dieting to talking about processing animals for consumption. It goes deep into the reasons to become a vegetarian. It details graphic events about the slaughter process and inhumane treatment of animals. I am against mistreatment of animals, but not everyone will become vegan because of it. I guess that I just wanted to know about their eating lifestyle; I did not want a lesson on the beef industry.As a meat-eating citizen, I did find some things useful. For example, there are butter substitutes, milk substitutes, and healthy snack foods listed that I am willing to substitute into my diet. There are also some facts that I learned that I did not know before, so the read was not a total loss."
3,Girls love it,I purchased 3 books one for my wife and one each for 2 of my daughters . They read it straight through and felt they came away more knowledgeable of the things they eat and are changing their eating lifestyle .
1,stupid,This is stupid....we were going along fine until it said that we as humans were not intended to drink milk and then I just slung it across the room and haven't picked it up...I will put 25 cents on it and TRY to sell it at the next gararge sell I have.Don't waste your money on this unless you are a TRUE VEGAN! And I HAD to give it 1 star.
1,Surprisingly worthless,"I picked up this book thinking it would be a witty no-holds-barred take on dieting and getting fit. What I found was a book filled with questionable information and cursing. Who knew? Skinny Bitch is filled with half truths based on the authors misunderstanding of nutrition. For example, unaware that coffee is an important source of anti-occidents the authors talk about coffee like its crack. Unaware that health food stores sell both good and questionable food, the authors encourage readers to put their brains on hold and head for health food stores.If this were not enough, the book is vulgar. The authors seem to lack the vocabulary to express their thoughts and constantly descend into crude language. This, I gather from the text, is supposed to mean that they are ""honest."" Most of the time I give books away when I am done. I threw Skinny Bitch in the trash, not wanting to expose anyone else to it."
1,Shameless PETA advertisement,"It is hard to take any information in this book seriously. The author may have a nutrition degree, but this book rages on and on about eating dead rotting flesh, and about being kind to animals, thus making a case for the vegan lifestyle. I thought this was going to be a book about getting healthy, but instead, it is a book about pushing the PETA lifestyle. It even goes as far as to quote from the PETA acceptable foods list. It also makes a case for eating vegan foods and processed soy products, similar to Linda McCartney. Hasn't there been recent studies to show that soy mimics estrogen in the body, and doesn't estrogen feed hormone driven cancers, and what did Linda McCartney die from? Maybe not the best reference. If you want to get healthy, YES, STOP EATING CRAP, but don't buy this book."
1,"Angry women, eat something please","I have read many diet books, but I do not put this book in that categorie. It was the worst book I have ever read! Do they think that because they swear they are funny, or worse yet have a clue how to diet or what it is really like to have to lose weight? I would not recommend you waste your money on this book. I can't imagine why they consider this a diet book, or even a healthy guide to living a vegen life. AWFUL!!"
2,misleading and a big waste,"i bought this book on my kindle annd read asample beforehand. i thought it was so funny i bought it... mistake. the first chapter after the sample promotes veganism excessively and talks about the corrupt government(?!) then it prmotes fasting of up to ten days and encourages readers to ""ignore nausea and dizziness"". Do not buy if you are looking for a diet wakeup call because you will get a totally different book than what you expected."
1,Skinny In Content Too,"These authors seem to self-consciously set out to use crude language here and there ~ I presume so we will think they're sophisticated and not afraid to say ""Bad"" words.In the end (although I didn't read that far) what they're asking the reader to do is become a vegetarian.Even for a diet book, this is lightweight."
1,Lost 50lb in 8 months on low-carb,"Won't need to read it since I know from the blurb that it is false. I lost 50lb on a relatively high meat and fat diet. LOTS of animal products: cheese, eggs, meat and fish. As well as lots of vegetables. A little fresh fruit only. Cut out all other sugars and all other carbs almost to zero. No fast or healthy grains. NO GI whatsoever! Lots of diet soda. Fat came off. Lost 50 lb total and kept it off for 4 years now.Sorry, no amount of clever sass is going to convince people that Atkins and other low carbohydrate-higher fat and protein diets do not work. Thwere are simply too many of us fatties who became thin from it! Low-carb rules the roost, vegans!"
1,Language unecessary,"I can see where this book could have good points, but the vulgarity of the language through out makes it completely devoid of anything of quality. You can be no-nonsense without being ridiculous. Skip this one. Find something better."
1,Bitchy Propaganda,"The authors of this book take scientific research and bend it to fit their agenda. It is a book of unbalanced arguments and curse words to try and sway the un-skinny into being vegans. Veganism is fine and everyone has a right to know the truth behind food production and the details of the government's rules and regulations, but this book is very one sided. You don't need to be vegan to be a ""skinny bitch."" Readers beware, research your decisions beyond the words of Rory and Kim. If you are serious about losing weight, please see a nutritionist to discuss the options that are best for your specific needs."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Rate it R for language and graphic violence! The authors are foul-mouthed bullies that talk down to you the reader! Nothing hilarious about that! The ""F"" bomb is prevalent throughout the book. This is not a diet book, its a recruiting book for vegans. The book spends the first couple chapters telling you the downfalls of processed food, sugar and sugar substitutes (Nothing we all don't already know) then the rest of the book graphically describes the horrors of the meat processing industry. In the last chapters the authors actually admit that grossing you out about meat is their main goal. I was incensed, no animal should be treated like that, but if I choose to become vegan, it will be my own choice, not because I was horrified into it by a couple foul-mouthed liberal idiot bullies! I for one still enjoy eating meat despite their best efforts! Don't waste your money!"
5,entertaining reading,"i GOT THIS BOOK FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE LOVED IT, SHE SAID IT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND SO FUNNY. SHE HAS SINCE READING THIS BOOK QUIT DRINKING DIET SODA."
5,Hilarious,"If you have a sense of humor, you will laugh your ass off and possibly learn a thing or two. It was a quick read and enjoyable."
2,not impressed,"I purchased this book when suggested by a friend. I had been having some medical problems, and my friend told me it helps teach you what to eat to be healthier. If I were overweight I would be even more appalled than I was after reading this book. The way they talk and refer to their 'friends/ aka customers' is down right wrong. I expected the language but for heavens sake ladies, your still dealing with human beings. If you are overweight do not by any means read this book. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief. Go see a real dietician, cut back on portions, fast food, junk food, and absolutely no soda pop, and I promise you will lose weight. Also if you're not the type to work out, do more chores around the house, park in the farthest spot from every store, building, etc, and you will burn calories"
2,It could have been good,"The content of this book was well researched and showed passion that the writers obviously feel for their mission in life. It is unfortunate however, that they use the f word very liberally, it is a disappointment that they don't know any adjectives that would make them seem intelligent."
2,Skinny Bitch is Misleading,"Nowhere on the cover or in reviews that I have read does it tell you that this book is about vegetarianism or veganism. I thought I was getting a good no nonsense book about diet, I did not know I was getting a diatribe about the evils of eating meat or dairy. Also, while the language is a little cute and funny at first, it soon loses it's amusement value and becomes just foul and disgusting. I would not recommend this book to my friends."
1,VEGAN !!!!,"This book was created to promote the vegan lifestyle but doesn't use the word vegan until the fourth chapter. I read the front and back cover plus the first few pages inside front of the book and in the back of the book. There ws no mention of the vegan life style. I returned the book. I would have never bought this book if I had known it was promotng veganism. I've known several and none of them look healthy to me. So, if yo have no problem with this life style, buy the book however, think about this.... The authors and the publishers chose to not use the word ""vegan"" up front. Would you ever trust what those authors have to say? Would you be leary of buying another book from Running Press? I'm not going to buy from these people again. Think about it."
3,"Kind of sneaky agenda, but spunky style","I really liked the tone of this book: it made me want to make some changes and walk my talk. However, the chapters on animal cruelty and vegetarianism were a bit much. I think that this could have been two separate books, one editorializing the need to be more aware of what we eat and how the planet is treated, and the other a motivation to get our ""ducks in line."" Overall, because I felt a bit ""preached"" to, I give this book 3 out of 5 stars. Well written, with an edgey aroma and a bitter finish."
1,Vegans Suck...,"At least that's what these writers are making me think. I have made it half way through this book and hate it, but I will finish because I never leave a book mid-way through.So according this book, the only way you can lose weight is to become vegan. Bulls***. Oh, sorry, tofus***.As for the content of the book? Scare tactics, anti-meat, anti-government and they throw around cuss words because they think its more ""real"" and ""cool."" Whatever. Go to the PETA website and a Pro-Ana website and you'll get the same info...without the curse words.I apologize to all the vegans out there on behalf of these writers that are giving you all a bad reputation."
1,Not What I Expected,"This book came off like it would be entertaining and informative, but it was all about becoming a 100% vegan. I thought there would be a middle ground somewhere, but basically came down to: ""you must be a vegan to be skinny"" I found that it should be written on the back of the book, so if your not ready to take that huge step, you dont waste your money on this book. At first the cursing and vulgar language was a bit entertaining but the it became way too much. Personally, I found this book to be too new age and tried way too hard to come off funny. Not impressed at all."
4,Gotta read it,The authors are blunt maybe a little overboard with their fowl language but they are trying to be funny in order to catch the reders attention. Besides that everyone should definitely read the whole book lots of very important life changing information that even the unhealthiest of people can adjust to! It works!!!!
1,I really want to rate this a ZERO!,"I heard about this book and decided to check it out before buying. I only got as far as reading a few excerpts and reviews here on Amazon before feeling the need to run the other way...fast.From the excerpts I read, I see nothing 'funny' about this book. The authors berate and insult the reader incesently. That's not funny--it's just plain mean. To target young women, and then prey on their deepest insecurities is absolutely horrifying.I am a 38-year-old woman who has suffered from eating disorders for 23 years. I am appalled at the insensitivity of these authors and their compelete disregard for the psychological frailty of their target audience. Calling someone a ""fat-pig"" over an over can do no good, whatsoever.From what I can tell, this book is toxic. I would NOT recommend it to anyone. Period."
3,Vulgar Language That Would Make a Truckdriver Blush!,"The content of this book is fairly interesting, though it is shrouded in extremely vulgar and profane language. I'm not sure why the authors deemed it necessary to do so; shock value, apparently?"
2,Good,"I loved this book. I laughed the whole time and, yeah, there are some parts that made me feel like I was a giant porker, but they made some great points and I think I'm healthier for it.I wouldn't let young girls read this book, because they have enough body image issues, but in your twenties, yeah, this is worth the read."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is one of the worst books I've ever wasted money or time on, prompting my first nasty review ever. The biggest collection of pseudo science I've ever seen, is peppered with gratuitous foul language approximately every third word. If they had any merit, they wouldn't have had to resort to the cursing."
5,Skinny Bitch has it all!,"Ohmigod this book is the book for you if you want to have a great body.This tough-love,tart-mouthed,yet very true book reveals the truth about the crap we shove down our mouths daily.And truly,after reading this book,I am really thinking of becoming a vegetarian.This book also reveals the truth about dairy and meat,and how its processed.Admit it,this book may be a bitch,but look forward to a healthier beginning."
4,Very Fun Read!,"When I bought this book, I'm sure like many others, I didn't think it was something trying to convert me to a vegan lifestyle. So for one, it is misleading, which is a downer, especially if you are a meat-lover and just wasted $20. However, it's a very fun read and definitely an eye-opener. Sure, some of the info may be a little far fetched (or at least I think so) and they only exaggerate the worst part about consuming animal products. But nonetheless, I have become a vegetarian because of it and I've never been happier. I have recommeded this book to many friends, and they all agree. I wouldn't hesitate if I had to purchase this one again. Buy It!"
3,Cute and Informative,"The reason I only gave this book three stars is because it is very short, and there are eating helps cluttering the last quarter of the book. I never like books that offer that. I wish the authors had added more info in their funny and stylish presentation."
4,informative and hilarious!!!,"The book has a lot of great content - i've been reading about health and fitness for 20 years and am up on just about everything... this book really zero's in on a lot of useful stuff, but in a really funny way. very quick read and you will laugh your butt off."
2,don't focus on the cover...,"Since I've switched my eating habits to organic, my friend recommended this book to me. Bottomline: I really didn't enjoy the book... The book has a lot of great facts about conventional food. However, I already knew about the pesticides, hormones, steroids, etc. Hello, all you have to do is research online?95% of the book is the author giving facts about what is in conventional food. Moreover, she uses every bad word under the sun to try and get it into the reader's head. That just rubbed me the wrong way...THEN, the one tiny chapter that talks about what food you should be eating, just gives you a list of Organic food, and just promotes eating organic. Save yourself the money with this advice: Eat Organic. Just research it online and you'll understand the benefits. Save yourself the money on this book..."
2,What a Misleading Book!,"I am quite angry that I wasted money on this book. It is not at all what it pretends to be. It's marketed as a diet book. In reality it's a hit piece on the food industry. Only at the end do the authors reveal that what they really want is for the reader to adopt a vegan lifestyle. I've got news for them--if that's what I wanted, that's what I'd do! What I don't appreciate is being lied to."
1,Vegan Book Marketed as Diet Book,"This book was absolutley terrible. I thought I was buying a ""tough love"" nutrition book -- but instead was treated to chapter after chapter of two unqualified, foul-mouthed women (which stops being funny about halfway in) pushing a vegan agenda. I get it: you're vegetarians. I respect your choices. But what do all the chapters about animal slaughter have to do with nutrition? There's so many moments and ""tips"" that are so ridiculous -- like giving blood or fasting to lose weight -- I laughed out loud. How did this make it to the bestseller list? I'm sorry, it needs more than a funny title to be a good book."
1,ugh,"Not what I expected, vulgar and self serving, No crediable advice, sorry I spent my money.Its ok to be a Vegan, however, not every one feels the same. Taking pot shots in a vulgar way at people who do not share their feeling was very offensive."
2,Horrific Slaughterhouse stories!!!! Very Disturbing. . . made me sick,"I bought this book to learn about how to eat healthy foods.It starts out pretty informative about diet sodas, and what is good to eat. . . then it launches into several chapters of SLAUGHTERHOUSE GRAPHIC HORROR STORIES. I was deeply disturbed, and cried for awhile. It pretty much ruined my day. Couldn't get the images of torture and horror out of my mind.BEWARE. . . you may not want to read this book, unless you're into torture.you should probably just go see Hostel instead! Deeply disturbed after reading."
1,Completely Misleading,"This book is a complete waste of time and money. The entire theme of this book is become a vegan and lose weight. Unfortunately, there is very little useful information for actually losing weight or eating healthfully. While the authors cite many studies, they use these studies to tell the truth according to them, meat=bad. Basically, this book is campaign material for the vegan movement. They seem to miss the mark that taking in more calories than your body needs, no matter the source of the calories, is what leads to weight gain. Some of their advice is just plain scary - nothing but fruit for breakfast, wait until you are completely starving for lunch. Finally, there is absolutely no good reason to use as much offensive language as they do. I would think after the editing process, someone would have told them that their language made them sound even more uninformed and uneducated than their ideas. Please do not waste your money or your time."
1,quick dont buy it,the first few pages of this book are great you think you are going to get a comic overview with some real life things that you can apply to everyday living.what you get are two ladies who if they do what they tell you to in the book must either a-live in a bubble or b- have no taste budsif you are a preteen or teenager you may enjoy the bookif you are a normal human looking for ideas of what have helped other women out this is not the book for you
1,Good book points but definitely not the best book for dieters,"Book starts out great giving information that anyone could use but then turns to discussions of animal cruelty and the horror of dairy products. The book makes you think but for most people, unless you plan a dramatic life change, this is not the book for some ideas on how to ramp up your diet. While it has some, there are better options out there. Read the other reviews to make sure that this is what you want."
2,Only if you're Vegan or plan to be..,This book was funny and pointed on somethings I will use. I didnt know going into it that this was about being a vegan or why you should be. If thats for you then this is for you.
1,"Terrible book, don't waste your time","This has got to be the worst diet book I've ever read. Obviously they have an agenda and it has NOTHING to do with getting women to eat healthy. What the hell does make-up, lotions and toothpaste have to do with healthy eating? Ok, I get the whole my skin is an organ thing, SO WHAT!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!! I feel ripped off. Not only did I pay money but invested my time to read this garbage."
1,Absolutely Pathetic,"It is first of all sad that I had to rate this book with one star as the minimum as it does not even deserve that. Unfortunately the fairness of this review is only based upon the first chapter. I was repulsed enough that I will not read the book and am saddened that I spent money on it. The attitude and laguage of the book are appalling. The writers present their material in such a negative format and write as if their lives far exceed the rest of the world's. Over half of my life has been spent in the nutrition/fitness industry, and if you are looking for help to establish better ways of eating or taking care of yourself, THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU! The book is insulting, belittling and has a very immature aura about it. And that is just the first chapter."
1,Waste of money,"I was really disappointed with this book. I kept hearing how amazing it was, so I finally bought it. Between the wrong facts, and verbal abuse this books just sucked. I hated it, pure garbage. I did NOT find this book helpful. I would encourage women to seek help elsewhere because this one is just going to make you cut yourself."
1,Don't read unless you're already vegan or plan to do so,"I have to admit, before reading the book, I hadn't heard much more than the title being tossed around. I was hoping that this would be more of a Mediterranean-style diet guide and a motivational book to get people to exercise and eat smaller portions. I certainly did not want to be attacked in the most disgusting of ways about the horrors of the meat industry. As someone who hasn't eaten pork or beef for the last 16 years, I really did not need to, nor was I prepared to, get all these gruesome details. I did not find this book funny, useful, or motivational in any way. Unless you are ready to go completely vegan and organic, this book is not for you."
4,Callenge Yourself!,"I thought it was a very funny book with a lot of good information. Being from Oklahoma, I know about farm raised meat. There is nothing wrong with eating meat when you know where your meat is coming from and I will continue to feed it to my family. Come on what would all these animal rights activist do if everyone stopped killing and eating animals! Talk about problems. The authors make some very strong points about some other health risks. I have since become vegan but for getting thin purposes only. I have followed the book for about a week now and I am already seeing changes inside and out. I will continue to have meat on occasion but I will not ever drink another diet soda!"
1,Bait and switch,"This is NOT a weight-loss book, it is an animal rights/PeTA manifesto. It appeals to women's vanity, and envy of skinny actresses and models. When women read it and figure out what the book is really about they feel too guilty to complain and get their money back. The authors are making a quick buck with a catchy title. If it was called ""A Foul Mouthed Diatribe on Veganism"", it would not have sold nearly as well. I doubt they will spend a penny of the millions of dollars they are making actually trying to help change animal welfare laws."
4,"Interesting, fun read","I just finished reading this book, after having wrote my own weight loss/get healthy book. I love the author's style and direct approach. It's time for a tough love approach to weight loss. If you choose not to be vegan, you'll probably choose to ignore a few chapters, but overall the books is good and worth reading."
4,Lifestyle Read,"I liked the title, but it did not prepare me for what was in the book. This read is an eye opener for anyone in terms of ""knowing"" your food. This book provides light and witty logic to the ingredients that the average person consumes; the authors have evidence and scientific facts to back up the claims that reveal the negative effects common ingredients have on our body (including fat retention, cellulite, etc.) The book didn't change my lifestyle, but I have made some changes such as giving up diet soda. Apparently soda contains aspartame which produces formaldehyde as you digest it. That is disgusting and what is banned around the world due to health reasons tends to be legal in America due to free enterprise. It is a good read for anyone that eats or drinks in America."
3,"Quick read, but better books out there","The book was funny and had some interesting facts that I didn't know before. It made me stop drinking Diet Coke (which is definitely worth the price of the book). Most of it seemed very commonsense but since most of the population is overweight, I think that commonsense seemed to have passed over the population. I am already a vegan so it doesn't take much for me to follow their doctrine. If you never plan on being a vegan, the book still has some important things to follow. I really enjoyed the section about the FDA being in bed with big industry. I don't agree with all of their processed fake meat products they recommend, even as a vegan I never use them.A more worthwhile book is Michael Pollan's new book In Defense of Food. It is also commonsense but a lot more intelligent.In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto"
3,A little overkill,"This is a totally straight forward, no nonsense look at the foods we consume. It explains the science behind substitutes that are supposed to be healthy and why they aren't. It walks you through the processing of the animals we eat and exposes some of the horrific ways these animals are treated on their way to be slaughtered. (That particular chapter made me physically sick). If you think the government cares about the quality of the food you eat, this book will open your eyes and change your mind.While there is a ton of great information, Skinny Bitch goes over the top in a push toward veganism. It's great to inform the reader about the risks of being a meat eater and the benefit to veganism but it's entirely unnecessary to beat them over the head with your personal preference.Overall this book has a lot of great information but can leave the reader resentful in its push for the vegan lifestyle."
1,Bad science!,"These ladies are mixing some solid research with some very bad science. They write, ""Trust no one,"" and I absolutely agree. Start by not trusting this book."
5,Changed my life,"This book changed my life. I was already cutting down on meat, thinking chicken and turkey were all right, as well as cheese. I've never been big on milk. I quit smoking 5 years ago and gained weight, but felt healthier for it. And I've already been eating organic for a few years too. BUT NOW that I've started the Vegan diet, I've shed 5 pounds in 2 weeks. More energy, more pooping, I feel clean! I've been around hamburgers, breakfast foods and chicken fingers and don't even flinch. I look at the meat as sickly, toxic, ugly and I get sad for the animal; I used to salivate. Now I turn away disgusted. Skinny Bitch changed me for the better. I've got my Vegan Starter Kit in the mail. And I gave another book to one of my good friends. I don't know how she'll do with it, but I'm so glad of what I'm doing for my health and the world's health."
4,Not only for skinny Bitch,"I have been thinking of becoming vegetarian for a long time, doing it slowly.I wanted some shock reaction and I got it, while reading the book.It became so much easier to stop eating meat.Boys and Girls, read it!"
2,La-aame,"The only reason these authors are skinny ""b*tches"" is because they have to live in eternal starvation as vegans. I guess that would make anyone a b*tch but I'll never know because a vegan I will never be. I eat all the things they tell you not to and I'm already skinny! I don't OD on the bad stuff but I don't say ""never"" to candy etc. As for their tell-it-like-it is approach -- I think they are just trying to emulate Simon Cowell in their over-the-top criticisms, but it kind of just comes off as bad writing. Calling people names and making stupid analogies makes them sound like they do not know how to communicate like adults. This book is only good for a few cheap chuckles, or maybe an English professor could use it as an example of very poor writing style."
3,Language makes is absolutely distracting!,I bought this book because the title caught my attention but after reading about 5 pages I saw the pattern. It's really hard to concentrate on what they are trying to tell you because of all the profanity. The authors were models/worked for model agencies but are completely claseless. Kim Barnouin is said to hold a masters degree but it is hard to believe that someone with a masters degree would conduct herself in such a manner. If you don't mind the language it has some interesting facts but if you don't like being insulted every few seconds skip it.
1,really awful...save your money,This book proves that anyone can write a book. It's by far the worst book I've read on nutrition. Nothing enlightening...offensive and full of awful language. I could have dealt with a little offensive language but seriously...every page? The authors may have meant well but they should consider becoming sailors.
1,This book was secretly written by PETA - it sucks,"Do not buy this book unless you are willing to become a Vegan. The entire book preaches to you about how bad every animal product is, and that we should all be vegans. The girls that wrote this book sound like they work for PETA. Pages and chapters of stories about how poorly animals are treated. All of that is fine if wanted to read a PETA book, or a book about the treatment of farm animals. But I bought this book becuase it looked fun, clever, motivating, etc. It wasn't any of those things. Their only motive is to save the animals. It's not a very good diet book. Just bashing and bitching the entire time about how horrible the world is for eating animals. Gets old fast. They also swear like sailors - funny at first, but it gets old as well."
3,Very strict vegan diet book!,"I agree with most of the principles of this book such as cutting out meat...I don't eat meat just a little bit of chicken sometimes but I do consume fish (not shellfish) and don't want to give up eating fish. Many fish are tested for mercury and do not pose a health threat if consumed up to 3 times a week (the omega 3 fish oils have many benefits.Also I don't think there is anything wrong with enjoying a latte or cappucino (I usually have mine in soy or low fat) as coffee has many antioxidants and the aroma of it can bring positive feelings.It is true that dairy is fattening. I used to be allergic to dairy and wheat and avoided both but fter having an allergy elimination done, I introduced them into my diet and have put on a little bit of weight (i was on the border of underweight and healthy weight range). I think a little low fat dairy if beneficial - if you read 'How the Rich Get Thin' new calcium diet book, you will see.)"
1,Horrible book,"Title implies that it's a diet book - but it's really a glorification of veganism with illogical and exaggerated ""scientific"" evidence. We shouldn't eat meat because tigers eat meat and they sleep most of the day. Since we don't sleep all day, obviously we weren't meant to eat meat. Huh? Lots of unnecessary profanity. I thought the first chapter was sort of funny, but then it went off into wild ideas with a few good ones thrown in. Processed food is bad (unless it's vegan; then it's good). No meat, fish, dairy, eggs, sugar, coffee, tea, carbonated beverages (both diet and sugared). And the pounds will just naturally come off. Probably because there's nothing left to eat!"
1,Awful book,"I had no idea, going into this, that this was a book touting veganism. While I don't have an issue with those who want to live this way, I don't. And I would've liked to know what I was getting into before I read the book. The authors spew ""facts"" that contradict other things they recommend. To say that donating blood helps you lose weight and that exercise reduces your appetite is silly. The authors sound like angry women trying to convince you to do things their way, instead of informed and educated authors stating facts. This was a huge waste of time and money."
1,Should be BANNED,"I will always credit this book with the start of my eating issues. Poses at a health book, but is really an introduction on how to be anorexic via becoming vegan. Words cannot express how much I revile these two hacks.Keep away from all teen girls/young women.I wish there was a negative scale rating. I would give this book a -10."
1,Foul Mouth Snobs,"If what came out of their mouths was half as good as what goes in, they might have been on to something. And it's just a glamorous title for yet another vegan book.If you like hearing women curse like sailors, you might appreciate this book."
1,Horrible!,Don't bother....a waste of money! There is no real content...it's meant to gross you out and scare you away from eating....useless...
3,good information,"This book contains alot of good information about the products we consume on a daily basis. I seem to be the only person who thinks the tone in which it was written was just dumb. I didn't find the writers to be 'just telling it like it is'. I thought they were trying too hard. Just kind of silly and inappropriate, and I'm no prude. I know it was all for shock value, but I still found all the profanity, for a self help book, to be really odd. But the information they provided was good and I catch myself reading labels more and really paying attention to what goes into my body. I will say they had proof to back up claims and probably did a years worth or more of research. Very important information delivered in an oddball way."
5,Changed my life!,I love this book so much and it seriously changed my life! I read it when I was 15 and became vegan afterwards. I am now 20 so iv been vegan for 5 years. All the negative reviews on here are just mad that its about being vegan but if you follow what they say you will be healthy beyond belief. Today I am a kickboxing instructor and currently getting my group exercise certification. Being vegan has made me achieve things that I could not have done physically before. I always recommend this book to everyone
3,Do you have to be a vegan to be skinny?,"I was quite suprised to relize when reading this that it is instructing you to become a vegan. It is a drastic change, one I'm not willing to make, but an idea I'm willing to play with. One thing is that I did LEARN alot. Like about sugars! I took some stuff with a grain of salt, it is written a little bias. Like giving you all this info to back their point up and tell you not to eat this or that. And then present you with little info that says soy is not good for you, but then tells you to make the dicision for you self. This book will bluntedly scare the meat-eater out of you! The book is right on, if you want to be a SB than you'll do what it takes. But like any ""diet book"" take what you want from it to make your own life style changes. Oh yeah... if you can handle reading the exerps you'll enjoy the outragious writting skills of the authors."
3,Somewhat misleading,"It did not take me long into this book to realize the authors are promoting a pretty strict vegan diet. I have respect for people who choose that lifestyle, but it is not appealing to me at all and I would not have bought the book if I was aware that this was their recommended diet plan. I was also bothered by their attacks on certain foods; the ""facts"" that they threw out seemed biased and questionnable. I'm not saying they're wrong, it really wouldn't surprise me to find out they're right, but they really, really, really attack foods and food practices that they do not like. I think that there are two sides to every story and feel that the book would have been more convincing if it had not been so, well, bitchy. Given that, if a Vegan lifestyle does appeal to you, you would enjoy this book and anyone who follows their diet plan would definitely lose weight and become skinny (but hopefully not a bitch)."
1,Irrational analogies,"This book is presented as a diet book or a guide on how to eat healthy but really their intent is to pitch their morals and borderline political. Their intent is to convince everyone to be an organic vegan, not help you lose weight or obtain a healthy diet. They use irrational analogies for you to follow their advice. For example, they encourage you to refrain from drinking milk because milk is for a calf and a calf is suppose to grow to become 500 lbs so if you drink milk, you will become 500 lbs. A lot of skinny people enjoy cow's milk daily. The advice had nothing to do with health or losing weight but rather a personal and moral issues of the authors. There are much better books out there for diet and getting healthy. I recommend ""You- The owner's manual"" by Dr. Oz and Roizen."
2,Preaching Veganism,"This book is great to convince someone to consider becoming vegan. I'm already vegetarian so taking that extra step doesn't seem that difficult. However, I picked up the book thinking it would help me discover a healthier way of life that wasn't necessarily vegan or vegetarian. People can be healthy eating meat along with everything else, so it's not necessary to be vegan to be a skinny bitch as this book seems to imply. It definitely seemed more like a rallying call to become vegan with maybe no more than 10 pages on how to eat healthy and everything else on why you should become vegan. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this book."
2,dont have a cow...,"i blindly got this book, hoping to snath up a few tips on how to be... well a skinny bitch. all though it was a shocking surprise to hear the cruelty happening to animals, do your research people its not all true. i was not interested in becoming a vegan, nor did i want to hear how my chicken was prepared. if i wanted to be a vegen i would have bought a book on how to be a vegan. but skinny bitch never advertised that they are strong vegans, and are wrongly pushing their beliefs on innocent readers. you don't have to eat veggie burgers to be skinny, eat healthy and control your portions, even if you do eat ham once in a while..."
1,It's Crap,"if you follow this diet, you'll lose weight. if you follow the atkins diet, you'll lose weight. if you follow the south beach diet, you'll lose weight. the question is can you follow the diet? the answer is no. i thought i was buying a book on weight loss. i wasn't. i was buying a treatise about the ""evils"" of eating meat and i returned the book. i'm not going to argue the right or wrongs of meat eating because i don't have too. what i will argue is that this book was misleading and fraudulent and not worthy of purchasing, publishing, or writing."
4,great straight to the point book,"To all those who think this is not a scientific book, or to those who say they went to medical school, you obviously didn't go far enough in your studies to see the real truth.First in medical school you learn hardly anything about nutrition, you learn about drugs. Second we as human beings are vegetarians, we DO NOT have teeth like a cat, dog, tiger, etc. We DO NOT have a short intestines to pass red meat quickly, it is even known by good doctors that read meat has to rot in your lower intestines in order to fully digests.... I could go on and on.The only thing that they do not point out in the book is about Vitamin B12, which you can get from spirulina, nutritional yeast, sprouts, and bee pollen.Apart from that the book is funny, and for those who find in offensive....get a sense of humor!"
1,An advertisement in disguise,"I bought this thinking it would be a common-sense look at food today, how to eat better with less chemicals, etc. And it started out that way, actually making me dump the diet soda I was sipping on at the time. But then it became nothing more than one big advertisement for a vegan lifestyle. Sorry, folks. I'm not into the hard-sell, give up everything except berries and twigs attitude. And your stories of animal abuse are not going to make me stop eating chicken - it only makes me want to lobby for stricter regulations. The book had a few laughs and a few good points, but it went too far in saying that if you eat any meat, fish, or dairy you'll be fat forever. My advice, if you want to be vegan - go for it. But you don't need this book to do it."
3,Inaccuracies,I've got mixed feelings on this book. There are a lot of factual inaccuracies in the book and in knowing that it makes me wonder if what is stated in the book and I didn't know is indeed correct. I think the girls are on the right track but need to rely a little less on urban myth and a little more on the science involved. Altogether not a bad read though. Just read it with a grain of sea salt.
4,A good start up plan for want to be vegetarians!,"I purchased this book with the intention of changing my eating lifestyle. Well I really did! I did not know half the things that were going on behind the ""food scene"" and I am glad I am now a vegetarian in training. I hope to share the same informtion with other people. I recommend this book ONLY if you are ready for al ifestyle change, not a diet fad."
5,Exactly as advertised.,"Pretty much the cheapest soldering iron I could find. Five stars because it does exactly what I expected it to and what it advertised it does; it gets hot within a reasonable timeframe, and the handle remained reasonably cool. Used it with rosin core lead-free solder to repair a usb plug which had been twisted off its circuit board.Advice: Don't touch the metal. Not just the tip, anywhere on the shaft. Yes I know that's obvious, but I didn't think about it and burnt the side of my finger in a moment of gloveless haste. On that note, always wear gloves and proper eye protection. Unless you're feeling brave."
4,A lot easier than making your own,"Easy to use, instructions were a little un-clear. Good product, well constructed. Saves time and headache of making them yourself."
4,Great sampling of a great talent!,"This CD truly demonstrates the ultimate talent of Tom T. Hall! A little known fun song is on it ""That Song is Driving Me Crazy"" that for me sealed the deal on buying this CD. All the music is pure Tom T. Hall and will hook you on him forever. I grew up in the south, and have fond memories of a number of the songs on this CD."
3,My Little Princess,"The delivery was prompt and I like the product, but I was ordering this for the pop-up box in the photo which showed some flamingos and I received a little princess box. I suppose you can't escape the Disney machine, but I ordered these for my son who is not into princesses (yet). I think the description should mention that you get whatever you get for the box design."
1,Another waste of time and money,Anyone who understands anything about the militia movement in america first knows that the american militia is not limited to a bunch of white hicks living in the woods. The american militia represents over 80 million lawfully armed citizens from every walk of life. For once Id like to see a completed work on the diversity and common purpose of this group as a whole and not such writings as this which is a feeble attempt to play upon the fears of people and make a buck in the process.
2,"An example of falsely yelling ""fire!"" in a crowded theatre","A prime example of neo-McCarthyism. Condemns themilitia movement through guilt by association.Libelously accuses militia leader Samuel Sherwood of incitement to violence with a false quotation. Book concludes with a recommendation for the Federal government to outlaw militias and suppress them, even at the expected cost of ""more Waco's"". The anti-militia movement now has it's own ""The Turner Diaries"" thanks to Stern."
2,You need to be a hard core fan,"You must be a hard core fan to like this. I bought this given all the hype. Visual content is good. Musical content and show is boring. This one is not a keeper. Performers like Cher, Madonna, Britney, Donna Summers are far better."
2,"Will ""Ronnie"" make the movie version?","Because whoever adapts it for the screen has one heck of a job ahead of him/her -- taking an unsympathetic and annoying main character and making her palatable. I simply cannot believe that someone as doltish as Christine Shepherd would make it that far in such a dangerous, lawless environment. Just because she knows her way around a gun? If you want to read a book by a H'wood spouse, you are better off w/ Gigi Grazer's The Starter Wife."
4,Nice Product,"Used this at a trade show for a baseball themed booth. It worked well, however don't let the bulbs hit each other, as they will break easily, and there are no spare blubs included. Good price for the product, easy to daisy chain multiple ones together."
1,Nothing But Trouble,"I hate this printer. I have had two of these. The first one decided to break down completely, and Lexmark very graciously sent me a new one. I do have to say, their customer service is great. Unfortunately the printer they sent me was no better. It'll print about two to three pages before it decides to quit, and then nothing you do will make it print properly. The scan function has never been problematic. The copy function, as related to printing, has similar issues. I never tried using it as a fax, but if it won't print, I'm assuming that it won't fax either. The color cartidge is singular leading to a waste of ink when one color runs out.Note: I do use Macintosh computer and software."
4,"Best value, but a little inconsistent","I was going on a 3 week trip, and so I bought three Lexar 512MB digital cards (one per week). On my trip I found that two of the cards were able to store 351 images, while the third only fit 280 images. All three cards were identical, and I only saved photos on all three (no videos), so it seemed strange that one card would have a smaller capacity than the others. That said, I still had some free memory at the end of my trip, so it's not like my trip was ruined from missing out on 70 photos. It just seems that the number of photos should be consistent in identical products, and I did not find that to be the case. Aside from that, they say that this particular card is the best value you can get, and I found it to be efficient, perfectly-sized, and very fast to upload, all at a reasonable price. That's why I give it 4 stars, docking 1 for the inconsistency I observed."
4,Almost The Quintessence Of Wonder's Career,"Before I acclaim 'The Original Musiquarium,' I have to criticize it. It seems that Wonder's associates unintentitionally left out some of the top 20 of Wonder's songs- ""Golden Lady,"" ""All I Do,"" and ""Lately."" Without them, songs like ""Do I Do,"" with a great horn section/tempo and a guest contribution from Dizzy Gillespie, distract the listener from that. The better part of the album includes ""Sir Duke"" (again with a nice horn session), ""Superwoman"" (with a nice transition to a sentimental piece), and ""That Girl,"" (which is sort of a mainstream R & B cut). Looking at the impact Wonder has had in the music industry, I really believe that he has been one of the greatest entertainers for a good 40 years and has a knack for songwriting and good melody. Overall, 'T.O.M.' should be in any true R & B fans tape rack."
4,Great Seller to Deal With,Long story short....I thought I was buying a paint can of the old tongue splasher bubble gum.When the item arrived...the item was in a good container...not a can and the label was called Tongue Painters.I was buying this as a gift from someone who loved Tongue Splasher as a kid.When I made contact with the seller he explained they were the same item and that the company who made the original product was bought and the new owners changed the name of the product and the container.He gave me some money back because of the perception that I was getting Tongue Spashers.He was very nice.
1,Neither game will run for me.,"I'm 42 and bought this because of all the rave reviews, but both games freeze/lock up my computer EVERY time I interact with the stories. In fact, The Final Scene locks up in the very first room, when the phone rings the second time. Dreamcatcher, the manufacturer, has been no help at all and seems to be ignoring me."
5,fast and sharp,looks terrific. great service. very speedy. too bad it didnt help us get farther in the Dance.
3,No miracle ocurred.,"Seems like a good enough product but did not seem right to callit Miracle Coat. There was no miracle when I used it on my two dogs.Their coats are pretty good on their own just thought this would add a lot more to them.The product works fine, just not worth the extra money."
1,health hazard,This kettle is a health hazard. It is very hot to touch and one should be careful not to burn yourself. Will return the item.
3,"Great setting, great main character, great world","Actually, there are worlds within worlds in this mystery-thriller: Thailand, and inside that Bangkok, and inside that the skin trade, and then there is the Royal Thai Police Force and the Buddhist philosophy. All this is brought to bear on a killing that is over-the-top unbelievable. The Thai Buddhist take on the American psyche is the most memorable thing. The characters are intriguing and well fleshed out. Overall, it is fascinating and a good ride. But the writing is clunky and the syntax strained at times. And the ending is way too convoluted and very unsatisfying. A near miss. Almost a great thriller. Worth a look, though."
2,Only read for book club,"If you like gritty, oddball murder mysteries set in exotic locations, then perhaps you will love this book. It ended up on our bookclub list this summer and that's the only reason I kept reading this quirky story. The storyline and characters weren't believable enough to be engaging, and not well-written enough to overlook those shortcomings."
3,Thai Spices Mask Flaws,"An outlandish plot sinks this otherwise fascinating look at Thai culture. The story is told from the perspective of the only honest cop on the entire Thai police force, a half-Thai half-American multi-lingual Buddhist who has more issues than the New York Times. The characters are unique but not as finely honed as they could be, and the unfortunate ending seems grafted on for the sole purpose of shock value. One more rewrite might have done wonders for this novel which never quite realizes its potential."
4,Recommended with reservations,"This massive 600+ book is a collection of black and white and color film stills and portraits from 1915 through 2000. Brief captions are provided for each photo. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't have any objections to the quality of the photos. I think they are quite good and there were several images that I had never seen before. But then again, I do not consider myself an expert on photographic print quality. Overall I don't think that seasoned film lovers will find much new here and it may not be worth the price to you. However, if your library of film books is scant or if you are someone who is just discovering classic movies, then this would be a great purchase. Makes a good coffee table book too!"
1,Well we all know what the Bible says about intellectuals!,"Is this guy writing from love of the Lord or to satisfy his own superiority complex? I have read a couple of the books he references and he has his own misguided intellectual misunderstanding. Most of us that are reading it are like children, in our faith and God gives us the understanding that goes for anything, even the Bible. No one should rely completely on anyone's teaching...Duh! But to imply intentional and false teaching, this is Satan at work! I can't wait until God clears the earth of all this garbage and back and forth and grandstanding."
3,It is ok for the price,I was not overly impressed. I was using it for a creme for a cut and I think it may work better for other applications.
1,Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant,A very biased book that is not backed up by many facts. The book neglects to mention Cuban-American terrorists like Orlando Bosch who killed 76 Cuban teenagers in a plane who were returning from a lacrosse match in Venezuela. It also doesn't mention the numerous attempts on Fidel Castro's life by our own CIA or the positive changes that have come to Cuba during the revolution.
1,incredibly biased read,"This book is far too biased to take seriously. Too much in your face, but little in the way of actual facts and documention. Stay away from this one...anything this strident, screams false. Look elsewhere if you want a more accurate depiction of Cuban political history."
1,What happened to the Canton Spirituals?,Great intro! Harvey takes full control. Some songs seem to be drawn out. I will admit there are only 3 songs that I think will have the potential to go all the way. Harvey does a jazzy job on the song American The Beautiful. I wish Harvey could have included his own group on the album.
1,Defective Lens,"I got one of those rare lemons, so I cannot speak about the lens quality. Despite having everything set correctly, it would not give me an F-stop reading and would not focus on AF or MF on my Pentax K-5. Amazon was wonderful as always about a return and refund. I would not consider buying electronics and camera products from any other retailer. I LOVE amazon.com"
4,great lens,"Optically is great, but it could be better if was built in metal instead plastic even when the platic quality is good"
3,Not McCurry's Best Work,"I am a big fan of Steve McCurry. I have his book South Southeast, which is superb. The photographs here focus a lot on the place and not as much on the people. McCurry excels with people. The photos are small compared with South Southeast and the reproduction of the images is lackluster. I was really disappointed. Still, you get a good sense of the temples of Angor."
2,The Big Blue One...,"ROCK & ROLL FRANKENSTEIN sounds like an instant classic, along the lines of BASKET CASE, BRAIN DAMAGE, STREET TRASH, SLIME CITY, etc. I mean, an undead rock star made from the bodyparts of deceased rock legends? Pure gold! Unfortunately, the joke gets old fast, leading to a long, drawn-out middle section that goes nowhere. While there are some redeeming moments, including a wild final act, they are connected by vast stretches of tedium. The monster is likeable in a John-Belushi-does-Elvis sort of way. He's also the only interesting character in the entire movie! I really wanted to like R&RF. Alas, even its most disgusting / shocking parts can't offset the dullness of the overall experience..."
1,Brutally bad,"Others have already said it better, but good God this book was awful. Predictable plot, stilted conversation, forced attempts to show knowledge of pop culture. What's with the random Demi Moore bashing? I bought it for 50 cents at a garage sale and overpaid. There's 6 hours of my life I'll never get back."
2,Not Her Best,"In fact, one of my less favorite of her books, down there with ""American Star"" and ""Rock Star"". Especially a drag as a followup to the un-put-downable ""Revenge"". I figured out who the evil stalker was about 1/3 through, maybe even before that. Very predictable, which is too bad, because one of the things I love most about her writing are the unpredictable twists her stories will take. It seems like her books are either extremely predictable, such as this and that LA miniseries she put out, or absolutely top rate w/twists you absolutely don't see coming. No middle of the road. Unfortunately, this is one of her more dissapointing ones. But even lame Jackie Collins is better than none at all, and the character based on Kevin Costner was rather amusing. My advice? Wait for paperback and buy Dangerous Kiss in hardcover if you want Collins at her sleazy, fun best. This one is blah."
5,Outstanding Songs,The songs take me back to when I was a foot solider back in the days of Vietnam 67-68. Alvin Williams 7/26/05 whoever who is selling it for 159.99 has lost their mind ? I have the album just wanted the cd for 159.99 somebody porch light doesn't come all the way on.
3,Spiderman Bed Review,"The quality is great. The problem is that the bed is too narrow for the child to sleep in. Neither of my 2 year old grandsons can sleep in it comfortably. Because the mattress is inflated and the cover zips up, they do not like the tightness and are usually found sleeping on the floor."
3,"Good for lounging, not sleeping!","My son is 4 years old, of average height and weight. He fits fine on the bed and under the covers, but the bed is only 26 inches wide and he constantly falls off of it during the night. It is not big enough for him to roll over. It would be a better product if it were about a foot wider. The ""chair"" does not stay assembled as it appears on the ad either, the child has to sit on it to make it stay that way, there is no velcro or snap to hold it in position."
4,works fine,The tires came on time with no problems. PSI on the new tires is 90 verses 100 for the old tires.
4,We love Nancy Drew games,"Who doesn't love a good mystery. This one was alittle harder for the girls to work on, it took several weeks and many different friends over to finally crack the case. But like most things, just keep on working on it and thinking and it will come to you! This one you really had to pay alot of attention to every detail and word said."
3,Apricots on the Nile,"Not as good a story as some other cooking memoirs I've read, kind of sad. Fair recipes"
1,It was extremely boring and very hard to keep up with.,"It was extremely boring and very hard to keep up with, since I personally had no real interest in the book anyway. I am a 12th grader that has to read this 8th grader literature material. I couldn't even get into the book if I tried"
2,Title may mislead,"I thought this DVD was like a documentary or something similar, however it's just a couple of interviews with Bret and C.C., not bad at all the interviews but nothing that real fans wouldn't already knew."
2,Poison interviews,"Released 1 year after the 'Hollyweird' album it contains 2 interviews, one with Bret Michaels during the 'Flesh and Blood' World Tour and another with C.C. Deville during the release of his solo album 'Samantha 7' before his return for 'Power To The People'.Ok but not enough material and no music.It is also known as Poison Rock Legends.(The import version, exactly the same dvd with a different cover)Buy Poison Stand On The Road instead which is also basically the same dvd re released under a new name yet again, it has the same 2 interviews but also has music videos included, which the first 2 versions don't."
4,4 1/2 stars for The Black Keys influential musician,"Five of these tracks also appear on the Kimbrough LP I purchased recently (""All Night Long""). Fine, glad to have them. Allows them and others here to make their way to the MP3. All of these tracks were recorded live at various local Mississipi venues. Junior didn't get out much and I don't think he ever set foot in a recording studio. No denying his genius."
4,Nothing like the actual albums.....,"Switch was fantastic back then. I own all 5 albums in the original state and I would have never thought back then that those albums would be so valuable to me today. This compilation is great but does not measure up to all the other tunes. I would love to get an update on the remaining band members: greg williams, thomas debarge, eddie fluellen, jody sims, and phillip ingram. I would also love to see any archives of past performances, or perhaps past and present pictures. ""There'll Never Be"" another group like ""SWITCH."""
3,"A Good Book, But Wishes Come True Was Better","I bought this book on the basis that Wishes Come True was an excellent book. I loved how Ms. Nance brought her characters to life. I enjoyed reading More Than Magic, but something was missing. I would have enjoyed it more if the character had more life, chemistry...something I can't put my finger one!Good book, I look forward to Ms. Nance's next book. Keep writing, I'll keep reading and buying!!!"
1,This is a book that could have been so much better!,"I couldn't believe this book was so bad, after all the good reviews. It sounded interesting, but overall it was just plain boring. I kept hoping it would get better and it never did. I bought it on an Amazon recommendation - which was a mistake. If you want to read a good romance, read Dara Joy's Matrix of Destiny Series (Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar, Mine to Take). Don't waste your time or money on this book! Trust me, you can do so much better!"
3,"Pretty good, but tedious at times","This book is pretty good, but it spends too much time, I think, describing everything that the auto companies did wrong, and not enough about what they did right. An interesting feature of this book is that in the portion about what went wrong the book details almost exclusively the foibles of the CEO and Vice Presidents of the car companies, while the section on the ""comeback"" details the activities of lower rank managers and engineers. Coincidence or intentional? The message seems to be that when CEO's get out of the way, the workers can succeed. Overall, this book was good, but I thought that Mary Walton's ""CAR"" was a better car book."
3,comedic absurdity,"A master of slapstick dialogue, Pinter forces the reader to analyze the efficiency of one's language and it's ability to convey one's meaning. Indeed, a must-read for anyone interested in theater of the absurd."
3,Just another author trying baseball,"A fair read, amd written well because of special access to the A's while they were winning 20 in a row, but Lewis' soujourn into baseball seems contrived, as if Thomas Boswell or Roger Kahn spent a while writing about all-star mutual fund managers. I enjoyed it, but I really got such a rush from Lewis' other works that I hope he goes back to where he really stands out. Dozens of sportswriters could have done this book, maybe with a little less style, but done it nonetheless."
5,Challenges baseball's conventional wisdom,"I have been a serious baseball fan for over 25 years. I thought I knew the sport pretty well. Moneyball changed all of that. The book really opened my eyes on the real inner workings of building a MLB team. Like many other baseball buffs I have built many fantasy baseball teams, but the book describes how building a real team is vastly more complex. The chapters that describe the limited use of traditional scouts are fascinating. While I love baseball stats and scouting reports, I now look at them very differently than before. The book proves that baseball truly is a thinking man's sport. Moneyball will go down as one of the most influential baseball books of all time."
1,Money for Mr. Lewis,Mr. Lewis wrote this book for the sole purpose of getting your money. The author could care less about the game of baseball.Don't waste your money or your time on this poorly written book.
4,Great read,"Billy Bean has done for baseball what Nathan Myrvhold has done for cooking in ""Modernist Cuisine"", and Michael Lewis was there to record it.If you like intellectual science in sports you'll love this book: it tells the story of those who were able to look at something traditional from a new angle."
4,A new way to look at baseball,"it's always interesting to see someone deconstruct anything and put it back together in a way that makes you see things totally differently than conventional wisdom. The story fo the 2002 A's does that.The one unanswerable question I had that Lewis never answered was-what happens when EVERYONE in baseball adopts something closer to Beane's sicientific approach? Will his present advantage disappear or will he adjust his approach again?That's a relatively minor quibble. This is a great read.I would only note while the Mets are now a mess, Kazmir, the high school pitcher that Beane passed on, is having a great season. We'll see."
4,Learning more about baseball,I was quite surprised how much liked the book as I'm not much of a fan of the sport but it was a gold read.
4,An interesting book made from an unlikely combination,"When I first looked at this book, I wasn't too interested in it. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to take a chance. The book had a few central themes. First and foremost, it is about how statistics, when used properly, can make an organization more efficent. Secondly, the book deals with how traditional baseball has resisted the use of statistics to make teams more efficent. Finally, the book is a quasi-biography of how Billy Beane attempted to implement all the above. While this may not sound too interesting, I can assure you, this book was quite entertaining and it hasn't been a bestseller for nothing. I would recommend this book to baseball fans and non-fans alike."
4,Reveals More About Baseball,"Money Ball was a great book. It shows that you don't need money to win in baseball(take that Yankees ;-P) Michael Lewis reavels that the team with the 2nd lowest payroll, the Oakland Athletics, can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team. Lewis also tells the story of Billy Beane the GM of the Athletics. Billy's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the MLB. He exerts his attitude as a force over the so-called ""experts"" when a desicion must be made. Billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of. He shows that there are many aspects of the game that we don't know. All in all, this was an excellant book. My only complaint was that there was a lot of swearing.--- Jesse Hartman"
4,70's A's,"The Coliseum sucks as a venue . No matter the theory for player selection. The book was extremely interesting, especially for a Cub' s,Red Sox and A's. fan. Bring back Catfish."
4,Moneyball,"A 1st rate book that I couldn't put down, nice balance of facts & story line. Haven't seen the film yet, but now will for sure"
5,"A great , quick read","I'm not a sports book reader generally, but a friend recommended this one and it is truly outstanding. It's more of a business book than a sports book, focusing on the market inefficiency in baseball created by old-timers using intuition about how to draft and trade players.It follows a great story line about the Oakland A's, who with 1/3 of the budget of the top spenders routinely finish up near the top, by taking a more statistically based approach to selecting players and spending their budget. It reads like a novel though, in part because Lewis is a good writer, and in part because of the material (Billy Beane, Oakland's GM, in particular is a character).I enjoyed it thoroughly -- it heightened my interest in baseball, and it made me look at markets in general with an eye towards seeking inefficiencies and opportunities in a new light."
4,Best I've found,"No matter what you are keeping an emergency food store for (Hurricanes, power outage, zombie apocalypse) this is a very handy item. Long shelf life and I especially liked that it can take extreme heat which means you can keep a hunk of this in your car without it going bad. Plus unlike other emergency staples this doesn't take much space and is light and easy to carry."
2,"Cute, but......","....it's so inconvenient that you must remove the nano in order to charge it up. Had I known this, I wouldn't have purchased it! Would rather get one of the ""skin"" covers. Disappointing."
3,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, this adorable little case doesn't come with the promised belt clip, nor does it have a protective cover for the screen. The inability to charge the nano while it's in the case is also an issue.But it'll do until I find something better."
1,An insult to one's intelligence,"While this book is an interesting read, so much of it is an insult to one's intelligence. The author begins by setting the premise that this book is only for those who can handle it, those of superior intelligence and courage not to stop reading.That is enough to make anyone with a higher education stop reading after the introduction. Many of its revelations are just Psych-101 and would not hold the interest of trained professionals or anyone familar with pathologies."
1,good night mister hyatt,negative? dark? is it? not really! its a simple book. very simple. especially for mr hyatt whom we know as an insightful and inspired author about magick and related fields. now: this book is all bleak and boring old darwinism. is mister hyatt getting old? frustrated? or did he simply wanted to publish some easy provocations leading to easy money? sad. really. the real psychopath says: non serviam mr hyatt; not this time. christians and other worms may be dutifully shocked out of their little whits by this tired bible. but - heeeee - mr hyatt thats not the audience your writing for. the beast yawns... we hope that mr hyatt catches himself - before he falls into the bottomless pit of pseudo-psychological boredom...
5,great machine,"bought this machine here on Amazon for only 30.00 refurbished with 6 months warranty and free shipping.What a deal? I tested the machine and I said do myself let me get few more to give to friends as a gift, but was too late the price went up to almost 100.00. The only thing I regret is because I bought it this year and I should've bought a long time ago even paying the 100.00 price. This machine is excellent I have cooked so many different thing on it and I love it. I do agree with someone that said that it makes a little noise, but just spray a little oil on it. It does what they show on TV commercial and much more ,just be creative."
3,"The debut album ""Abraham""remains their best:the new is...","This new album is quite tepid and discontinuous too: it's characterized by bad vocal parts (but this was also the main defect of their first issue)and strange guitar distortions, which are difficult to take !! Nevertheless the symphonic breaks through are always interesting, with the imprinting of a clever keyboardist,Paolo Paroni,whose classical music imprinting is a Q.L.S. trademark ... in fact He has been a professional musician for a long time and his experience is always very important within such Q.L.S.issues!! Moreover the female voice by Annalisa Malvasio gets this album more gracious and gentle too... well despite of being not able to achieve the goal of emulating the same artistic quality as into ""Abraham"", this new album maintains a certain charm, standing as a dignified work among the best recent italian publications by Aufklarung,Sacka,H20,Il trono dei Ricordi and so on...well make you choice !!"
1,Stay Away,"To me, spirituality is not just a collection of glib reminders to be happy. This kind of thing migh be appropriate if you have just concluded an intense program of electro-shock therapy, and need to relax. But it is not intended to be ingested by inhabitants of the real world.The casual browser should be cautioned that the glowing reviews of this particular book are almost without exception submitted by one-time reviewers. Could it be that John Roger has encouraged his obedient followers that this lifeless book needs a boost?"
2,OK book,"Started off well but then gets really messed up especially when comparing or linking with bible verse. The book could be very uplifting and beneficial to people with very low self-esteem or struggling with depression/addition. However it's the wrong concept to believe or make people believe that we are all god and can do all things, plus that spiritually stable is all about fun/happiness. My recommending of this book would depend strongly on who the reader is..."
3,good metaphors for life,there are some good metaphors for life and yet the book itself is disjointed..it was not one that i could not put down
4,"GREAT MUSIC, PLAIN AND SMPLE","This album pays homage to they way music used to be, crisp and clean, emotional, and mature. Finally a middle ground for music, away from the bubblegum teen junk on one side and the 65yr old rockbands on the other. The inspired meolodies are so simple in their complexity that you almost memorize by accident. Then find yourself singing about doing things ""My Way"" over and over again.Bottom line of you enjoy well writen/preformed music that explores a large pallet of moods and melodies then add this album to your collection"
3,The Future of Real Estate Profiting from the Revolution,"This is a book written for mostly the realtor. It has some good references to trade publications, but falls far short of its great title. I was expecting to see some talk about future trends in the real estate industry. If you want a great book read, Real Estate Rainmaker or Walk Like a Giant Sell Like a Madman, two of my personal favorites."
3,No songs from the actual film,The soundtrack is great but if you're looking to find some of the GREAT music (songs by artists) that were played in the film such asSun Kil Moon - Carry me OhioThe notwist - ConsequenceDeath Cab for Cutie - Sound of SettlingYou will not find it on this cd.
5,great songs,"huge debarge fan and all of the classics are here and thensome. El Debarge is One of the Most Underrated talents ever. all this Love, time will reveal, I like it, a dream,etc.... captures all of the great songwriting ,but the Harmony and richness of his voice is timeless."
3,Lots of Info But No Listings of Hits,"I bought this hoping to get listings of hits by each artists, but I was disappointed.The book does seem to contain a lot of info, and I've referred to it a few times as I've developed my music inventory."
1,this book stinks!!!,this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything. i didn't even like the story. i would give this book a big fat ZERO if i could!!!
5,Intense!,An explosion on a Russian nuclear submarine carrying fifteen rockets with thirty thermonuclear warheads too close to the shores of the United States could have the worst of consequences despite the valiant struggles of the sub's captain and crew. The action in this true story is nonstop as the book keeps the reader on a razor's edge between the nearly unsolvable problem that must be fixed even at the cost of lives and careers and the unthinkable option of a global catastrophe. First find a comfortable chair then kick back because you aren't going to be able to put this one down until the very end.
5,HOSTILE WATERS--AN UNTOLD STORY,"Maybe you remember. The book says something to the extent that, ""a certain event almost jeopardized the summit meeting with Reagan and Gorbechav."" This book tells you what that event was. It is a TRUE story. A very haunting story, and I'm one who lives in southern Arizona, far away from the scene of this event. This book is like a Hunt for Red October from hell. I won't tell you ANYTHING about what happens, because it is important that you read this yourself. Another classic example of our government hiding things from us hard-working blue-collar workers. Another amazing thing about this story is that IT READS LIKE A NOVEL, but it isn't. At the end, I found myself CHEERING for the RUSSIANS because the Americans were (sorry) so STUPID and SELFISH. To many people, ""russians"" is synonymous with ""evil"". I hope this book changes your view of the Russians, as it changed mine--they are no better or worse than we are, as we are all human beings."
2,disappointment,"I bought this book after reading the reviews here. I was greatly disappointed.It just wasn't scary. Sure, it had a lot of ""twisted"" characters, but none were too well imagined. A blind doctor who wants to gouge out people's eyes with a spoon, a black woman who practices voodoo, a fat cop who's kind of dumb. Nothing that original.The gore was kept to a minimum, although one scene at towards the end attempted to make up for the relatively bloodless book. It didn't work. There were a couple of gratuitous sex scenes though. Probably the most descriptive sex scenes I've ever read in a book. I just found them exploitative and pointless.David Martin doesn't have a true writer's flair either. His words often fall flat. There is no beauty or style to his prose.Avoid this book."
3,Deep Space Nine Takes Off,"Though the official beginning of ""Deep Space Nine,"" was in the first episode, ""Emissary,"" the real storyo the station doesn't take off until this episode. In this episode, the first hints of Changeling life in the Gamma Quadrent is given. These few hints lead to a rude awakening to the Star Trek universe, as the seeds for first contact with the Dominion are set in episodes to come. Sadly, that is all the episode offers. If you don't buy this episode for the first hints of the Dominion, you may be wasting your hard-earned dollar. The episode is basically a fair, at best, episode of the Star Trek phenomeon."
2,wrong titles,"i wanted the episode from the last season. episode 8. When i looked it up on amazon, it said it was part of the dvd i ordered but when it arrived, it was not."
3,Decent video,"I like this video but I don't love it. It's very basic, so if you are new to yoga or working out at all, it might be perfect for you. It leaves me feeling as if I want just a bit more though."
4,Good but could be better.,I was honestly hoping for more of a challenge but perhaps it's just not meant to be so. It is however a very relaxing video and I enjoy doing it right before bed to calm me. I felt safe the whole time while performing the exercises.
5,Nice prenatal workout,"The prenatal workout here is perfect for a pregnant woman. The yoga is moderately paced, not as slow as the Crunch Yoga Mama DVD, for example. The instructor, Heather Seiniger, has a soothing manner and keeps the class moving along nicely. There is a good, logical flow between the postures.The sequencing is approximately as follows:10 minutes of warm-ups: side stretch, gentle twist, cat/cow, plank, downward dog, child's poseSquats and prenatal sun salutesTree poseStanding poses: warrior II, extended side angleMore squatsSide stretch, gentle twist and savasana (final relaxation)All the squatting is supposed to be great for the birth muscles and also your lower back. I always feel calm and refreshed after I do this DVD."
5,The Voice of an Angel!,Incredible! Both songs on this cd single are beautiful! Ms. Isaacs combines the traditional styling of her vocals with the contemporary feel of her music to achieve a sound that country fans old and young alike will absolutely love! If you've never heard the voice of an angel...then listen to Sonya Isaacs sing!
5,unique,"One of the only albums that upon listening, I feel like everything is not going to be okay and nobody will ever show any compassion for you.To call this ""avant garde"" is to minimize how far out this is."
4,2 Great Songs,"I bought this CD for two songs; ""Sylvan"" & ""Per Un Sogno Vincente"". The rest of the album is forgettable but not awful. Considering the price I paid it was worth it."
1,"If you don't like KDE, don't buy it.","This book has an oversimplified installation explanation(20pages), and then jumps right into KDE. I prefer GNOME so this book was a waste of money for me. I have been working towards switching to Linux for a few years, switching to a browser and office program available for both Windoz and Linux to simplify the transition, and playing with Linux on an old computer. I had hoped this book would help with the final step, but it didn't. Installation is a tedious process, even the ""pros"" don't get it right om the first try. I bought a new computer with Linux preinstalled, and it didn't work, and had to be reinstalled. A beginners book as this claims to be needs a thorough installation section, but less for the desktop which has many similarities to windoz."
5,very good,This DVD held my grandson's attention for a long time. I can't wait to sit down and watch it all at once! The pictures of the baby animals are very cute. I would recommend this DVD.
2,We've seen it all before,"Nothing new in this book except it shows some of the more obscure advanced kata not found in ""Best Karate"" which is much more complete in its description. Also, every kick is unrealistically high. Pass."
3,The Advanced Shotokan Karate Handbook,"I must admit, this is a very good and honest attempt at trying to compile the Kata series. The quality/angles of photography and the depth of bunkai applications could have been a little better. The kumite sequences and sets are pretty interesting.Over-all... a good book for upto brown-belt grades... to be used as a tool for quick reference.But watching Mr Sahota in action, certainly makes me want to train with him when I visit England next.Cheers."
2,The Map is not the Territory.,"Capra has been charmed by a metaphor. Once you clear the underbrush away, what he's saying is essentially this:1. Many of the scientists who have delved into quantum physics since 1900 have said some things that sound similar to what many eastern mystics have said about the nature of reality.2. Therefore, quantum physics is like eastern mysticism.It is easy to see that the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. What people say about reality isn't the same as reality, and it's unclear that the physicists and mystics are talking about the same thing, even if they are using similar language.I am not saying that Capra is necessarily wrong. I just don't think we know enough to say one way or another. Capra's argument basically comes down to an argument over the meaning of words...which is pretty thin stuff to base a theory about ultimate reality on."
1,Wooly-minded tosh,"Early on in this book, Capra describes Nepal as a Buddhist country. The 90% of Nepalis who are Hindu might disagree. If he can't get such a basic fact right, how can we trust him on anything else? And as for Capra's avowed use of ""sacred herbs"" to enhance his knowledge of the universe, well,no matter how you choose euphamistically (or mystically) to dignify taking it, a drug is a drug is a drug, and the only thing it teaches you is what it feels like to take that drug. Wooly-minded tosh."
5,One of my Favorites,This book is a great book to use as a reference for papers. It also helps me learn quantum physics because it relates it to ideas that I am already familiar with. I also use this book to better understand my spell work.This book is not an easy read. Some parts are quite technical and advanced. It is the kind of book that one can carry around with them for a while and still have different parts to chew on.
1,The first of a long line of metaphysical babble,"Capra's book was the pioneering volume in a long line of metaphysical babble, attempting to find solid links between the apparant otherworldliness of quantum physics and the similarly odd world of metaphysics. It's a poorly motivated parallel, and serves only to trivialize physics, not to elucidate either area. The book is a favorite of those who have trouble seeing that non-conformance with the macroscopic world doesn't automatically push the objective study of quantum physics into the subjective world of metaphysics."
4,Worth Your Time,"When I read the beginning of this book, I was initially frustrated by the number of characters and the uncertainty about where the story was going. However, as I got into it, I became more and more impressed by the intricately designed pastiche of horror vignettes that narrow into a singular story. The scenes are like a quilt of nightmares sewn together and the dark, backwoods characters will linger with you after you put it down. Some reviewers complain about the movie-like scenes. In a B-movie by a half-rate director, they might be cheesey, but in the hands of a horror master, they'd have you on the edge of your seat. I won't ever hear about the Jersey Devil again without thinking of The Pines. If you like to wrap yourself in rich, dark prose and feel a little uncomfortable (nothing sparkly here), you will enjoy this story."
2,Great bed when it holds air.,"I have had the EZ bed for about 3 years and have used it about 3 to 4 times a year. The vinyl mattress is held onto the frame by little clear attachments. Our mattress came off of the frame attachment and created a small pinhole size leak. I can't find the patch kit (hint tape the repair kit to the suitcase when you get the bed) I really like the bed, but it is pricey, if it only lasts a couple of years when used 6 to 12 times. We are very careful with the bed and use it with a foam eggcrate topper and mattress pad for comfort. Needless to say, the hole is a huge bummer, but the bed concept is great! The bed is very easy to use and set up, I just hope that I can repair the one I have. Essential EZ Bed - Queen - Frontgate, Queen"
1,Leaked air first time used,"We purchased this bed to use as extra sleeping when guests come to visit. My two daughters were the first to use the bed. In the middle of the night they woke up with the bed half deflated, so they slept on the floor. Same thing happened the next night. I'm returning the bed."
1,One time throw a way,Bought new EZ Bed from Frontgate used it one time two older persons the alum. fram support broke on both sidesNow can't find any repair parts so throw it away. Very costly for a one time use. NO HELPBeware of this bed any problems your on your own. Good Luck
4,Get the stainless jar!,"Product is great, import company is not. That is why I suggest you purchase the blender with the stainless jar rather than the glass jar. If the glass jar breaks you are out of luck. Parts for Kalorik are unavailable except from the distributor in the US and they are flaky. Planning ahead, it will be difficult to get replacement blades. Beware even if Cooks Illustrated gave it a best buy rating."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Unfortunately, Mike Epps is one of those comedians that does better in movies than stand up. I'm not sure if it's because the material is already there for him in movies but when it comes to his stand ups he's lame!! It's like he didn't know he had a stand up and made the jokes up on the spot. I was watching this with a friend and he went to sleep!!! I'm funny when I want to be and I hate to be a critic for something I know I can't do especially for a living, but when it's your job you sorta have to know how to perform. Sorry Mike, stick to movies. God bless."
2,Not as good as the others!,"If you've see any of the other DVDs by Mike Epps, no need to get this one, he's telling the same jokes!"
4,Biography With Philosophy,"This book deals with the author's battles with polio early in life,and with depression and alcoholism later in life.Toward the end of the book he deals with tongue cancer.His thoughts while dealing with these afflictions are interesting and at times inspiring.There might be some moments of tedious reading,but the philosophy he imparts during his challenges makes reading this book a rewarding experience."
5,Such a Great Read!,"A good obit really celebrates the life, not the death, of a person, whether they're a celebrity or an average Joe. This book will change the way you approach the obituary page....not with dread, but with eagerness to see what gems are hidden there.Loved it!"
5,a must have for every Baobab lover,"If you're a succulent collector and want to find information about raising these trees, this book is not for you. But if you like seeing great pictures and information how the native people live with them and use them for food, water and shelter it has everything you're asking for."
4,Nice keepsake...,"My son was recently baptized Catholic and it was a great way to capture the day. It's very much like a baby book to where you can add photos and 'fill in the blanks' capturing details of the day. I wish it had pages where friends and family could write messages, etc. however, the book only had one page for this. Since it didn't have more pages, we improvised and had guests write their messages on the inner covers of the book. It worked."
1,requires a special expensive player,I didn't know what the hybrid meant but it was a special recording process which wasn't popular and it was very expensive. On my home equipment which is 10 years old they won't play. on my newer tv equipment they will. these are too expensive to not be able to listen to
4,Experimental trance for the ears,"This is slower tempo ambient that is focused more on the creation of interesting music and sounds than on filling a dance floor. ""Aqua Sufi"" has sitars and didgerido woven into the beats and synth washes, while ""Freedom"" uses religious chants/singing and ""Gaia"" closes with spaced out guitar work. It doesn't seem like Goa so much as like trance with an experimental attitude.A cool, non-standard type of techno from the Dragonfly label."
5,Our Prayer Shawl Ministry,"This book is excellent for any skill from beginner upwards in both crocheting as well as knitting. Many prayer shawls have been made from using the patterns found in this book. We have found the patterns to be totally correct. Although they are made for Lion Brand Yarn, other yarns may also be used to accomplish the projects.Everyone to whom I have given a copy of the book as part of the service has been delighted with the variety of patterns. We recommend this book highly for any group embarking on a prayer shawl ministry."
5,Very good book,"I found this book to be very easy to read, very complete, I'd thik it covers all the areas you need before starting a food business. The advantage to analizing 5 kinds of food businnes is that you can combine the ideas so you can come up with your own. Very goos book."
3,Good and Bad,"I like this game overall, but as you can see by the other reviews, it does have its flaws. What I liked about the game is just the mere fact that it is rather time consuming. You don't just put it in and win. You have to think and manage your planets carefully. The ""normal"" skill level is just way to hard to be ""normal"". I haven't even wanted to try to play it under ""hard"". Why bother when I can't even beat it under normal.I myself haven't had any problems with memory. But, I can't see a lot of the text when the starfield is on. This makes it hard to use the quick research function. The text is there, just can't read it. And it's not that I have a slow system, it's a brand new 866.I also think this game is very much like Master of Orion, just not as good. Well, maybe they will come out with another version of Master of Orion for us."
5,Wonderful,"This work of fiction that centers around communication satellites was written before any such thing existed. Arthur C. Clarke not only came up with the idea (like other Sci-fi authors come up with ideas), he also made com. satellites practical. He is credited with their invention. This genius work by this genius man should not be missed."
4,Brotherly Love?,"The setting: Venus-- The Plan: Van Humphries will travel to Venus with a crew to recover the remains of Van's brother.-- The reason: To gain financial freedom and distance from his father.-- The problem: (1) There is another adventurer seeking to gain the reward offered. (2)The temperature of Venus is such that it is near impossible to land on it and survive.I enjoyed this novel. It does have the element of science fiction in it, but it is also a great adventure story."
4,Worthwhile,"This may not be the best book in the world, but it is certainly a worthwhile read. For me, the writing did keep me wanting to read more and more, making it hard to put the book down. I'm glad I picked up this book at the store."
5,Realistic Science Fiction,"This was the first book I read from Bova. All I can hope for is that the rest of his books are as interesting. This book takes you on an interesting ride through space and Venus and throws in some very weird and unexpected twists and turns. If your a science fiction fan, please read this book. You won't be disappointed."
2,Not one of Bova's best,"I'm surprised that people like this book as much as they did. I really liked _Mars_, reasonably liked _Return to Mars_, liked _Jupiter_, but I really really did not like _Venus_.Why?Somehow, nothing resonated for me. I found the characters boring, the dialog awful at times-- note especially the horrible exchange after Van tells his father that he will tell the media all of his secrets:--------------------------------------------""You... you..."" Martin sputtered.--------------------------------------------I know that I'm not reading Bova for sparkling dialog and characterizations, but this really is sub-par.Even the descent into Venus just wasn't exciting. I often had trouble developing a mental picture of what was happening, something that was never a problem with _Mars_.Maybe it was Bova burnout? (I read _Mars_, _Return to Mars_, and _Venus_ over a 2 week period).Recommendation-- read _Venus_ last, or not at all. It isn't even that necessary for Bova's universe building."
5,Venus,4th Bove book I have read and I think he is terrific. Science fiction based on fact and lots of research.
2,Canon Wireless Remote,This device works but you must be directly in front of the camera since that is where the sensor is located on the camera. If you wanted it for shots of wildlife from an unseen location this defeats the purpose unless you are hiding right in front of the camera and you want to get in the shot with the wildlife. :) Good for self portraits I guess.
5,A real life safer!,"I live in Alabama and we recently had a really bad event with tornadoes and a record number of people lost their lifes. If you live in a area that may have a tornado or other life threatening weather that could develope and your want to know in advance, so you can protect yourself and your loved one's, you've got to have one of these.I bought one on Amazon last year and it has really been a life saver. It's easy to set up and use. You'll never know it's there until it's needed and it warns you ahead of time so you can take protective measures."
5,Peace of Mind,Love this product...I have always worried that I would not wake up if severe weather/tornados came through during the night because we live in the country and do not hear any sirens. This product is wonderful because I can set which counties I want to be alerted about and it tells me everything I need to know. Great product!
5,Product works great,"Exactly as described with no issues or problems. I would purchase this product again- in fact, I probably will!It melts/ shrinks nice and clear."
3,Mistaken Identity,"There seems to be a misunderstanding regarding Anne Lise and the ""Rendezvous"" CD. After a bit of research, I've discovered that ""Rendezvous"" was done by Canada's Julie Crochetiere. I can't rate this CD one way or the other but ""Rendezvous"" is really a discovery and I've just ordered the new CD by Julie Crochetiere."
3,Not what I expected..,"I like these earrings, but for the price, I expected the posts to be sturdier than they are.The posts are very easy to bend, and I have to be extremely careful when inserting them, and attaching the butterfly clasp. The clasps are very tight on the posts, making it easy for me to accidentally bend the posts. If that happens too often, the post will snap right off the earring.In any case, the earrings themselves are pretty, but I wish I had known about the flimsy posts before purchasing."
5,Well-made practical soffit vent,"When I needed to route the exhaust from my bathroom to the outside, I opted for a soffit vent because it seemed to be the least intrusive (compared to a wall vent and a roof vent). The first one I tried was a universal 4""-6"" spring loaded vent from Lowes. The plastic was very brittle and the spring mechanism tended to bind up. It rusted shut after 2 years. I like this new Under Eave Vent, since it closes with a simple gravity flap. The old vent from Lowes was circular and would allow moisture-laden air to be picked up by the other soffit vents and routed into the attic. This unit allows you to route the warm, moist bathroom air out away from the house. The construction is robust and the plastic feels flexible and durable. The unit itself is also pretty small, so it will be fairly unobtrusive. I highly recommend this item."
1,Book Description,"This is a book for police patrolmen. Its purpose is to help the new man solve innumerable problems during his orientation period as a law enforcement officer. Here in detail are the more common techniques for handling prowlers, robbery runs, mental cases, drunk calls, the always threatening man with a gun alarm, and the multitude of miscellaneous circumstances under which crime against people is classified. The rookie who reads this book will realize in short order that law enforcement is something more than riding around in a new car at the public's expense. -- Inside front flap of book jacket."
3,Nice introductory book,I would like to thank Mr.Michael H. Hugos for bringing such a nice introductory book to this most confusing field. He has explained very well how supply chain management is different from rest of the operations management literature. He has also thrown light on certain conflicting and very important issue like Supply Chain Performance. Good Luck...
2,Vanilla was good. This flavor tasted bad. Kind of bitter and plastic-y.,"Looking at the other reviews, maybe a bad batch, the Vanilla was OK. If you are looking for a sugar-free protein shake, I would definitely go with the Rainbow light - the chocolate is great, vanilla is good, but green. Both provide a good nutritional profile and fiber along with the protein and not aspartame or splenda."
1,THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP,"I HATE THIS GAME!!! IT SUCKS SO MUCH!!! not nearly what i expected it to be, so so so SO incredibly BORING!!!"
1,Doesn't work on minimum specified PC,"Note - if you have a Pentium II, this isn't going to work for you! On my grandaughter's PC, it just hangs and the mouse pointer disappears. NOT GOOD!She REALLY wants to play this game (and the game does start to work and then quit - so it makes her even want to play it MORE), so now I'm stuck with having to buy her a new PC!!! Aarrgh!"
3,This game Rules,Hey im stuck on the 4th horse shoe. if anyone knows how to open the cavern can you please write it in a review. PLEASE!!! i really need help. im stuck. but the game is great and challenging which is fun.
4,challengeing,"PLEASE HELP!!I've beaten this game before but I have seemed to forget where the first marker is. it says ""go nort 40 steps"" but i get stuck in a wall thingy!! It seems that a few other people are having problems on this too, IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF SOMEONE COULD HELP ME! tHx"
2,Could be better.,It only took me one day to bet the game. They should have spent more time on it. Don't buy this game unless you want a disappointment!
4,For the polyglot,"You get a lot for your money. The nice thing is that you can read and listen to the languages at the same time. I used the French section the most which has 12 basic lessons. The material is reasonably challenging for a good introduction. Each lesson has key sentences, a number of dialogs, and an informative piece of text aimed at tourists, usually several paragraphs. I have actually spent more time with this product for learning French than any other because of the pronunciation help.Don't count on actually having 101 languages, though. The Latin is just a list of aphorisms. Some languages are not covered as well as others. There are also a lot of bells and whistles, such as pronunciation practice, which don't seem to work very well. The languages you probably want to look at all seem to be on different CDs. The software crashes occasionally. Oh well. I may have an older version, but I'm generally happy with it."
3,Great Product -DOES NOT COME IN BOX,"I just bought this last week from this link. I love the Conair Infiniti line of products. The dryers are quiet and work well. The curling irons are great and so are the flat irons. I even love the brushes. Conair has the technology down. When I saw them offered in limited edition with the Swarovski crystals my heart jupmed because I love Swarovski and I thought it looked really good. The prices here is good also, considering the orignal retail prices was over $100. When it arrived it had everything but the nice wooden box pictured here. No where in the comments does it say it came without the box. I am still keeping it because everything seemed new and works well, but if you are buying it as a gift - BEWARE - there is no beautiful box that is pictured here. It comes straight out of the packing box. It does include the certificate of authenticity and the numbered tag."
1,Needs Better Packaging,"Product arrived in a thin white box and clay was not wrapped to keep it moist. I live in Arizona. By the time I received it, is was nearly dried out and I have been unable to get it to any decent consistency to use it. For me, it was a total waste of money."
3,"Hmmm, The music is the winner here!","Honestly, the reson I ordered this game was only to listen to the soundtrack. I think the music is good enough. Too bad the game didn't do good though. If they had put more focus and added more depth to it, then there would probably have been a sequel."
3,Restrictively useful,"Well maybe it was my fault that I thought this case is going to be a complete camera bag which will hold, not only my camera but also the innumerable cords and wires that come with it. I was kind of hoping for space to keep the wires, the wireless controller, the battery-pack cover and a couple of flash card boxes. As it turned out I was rather disappointed that it just covered the camera to a perfect fit and didn't leave space for anything else. Not having been able to see the productrates probably top among the disadvantages of shopping on the internet.Otherwise the case itself is quite nice, it fits the camera and just the top needs to be opened to operate any of the features including the charger and the USB cords.I haven't felt the other disadvantage of it yet as I haven't bought a lens adapter yet."
4,Perfect,Very Warm; my son wears it all the time up here in this north winter weather. Met my expectations. Thanks!
2,Im new to these so Im probably doing something wrong..,Tried them on but they are very tight going over my head and VERY loose around my neck. They need velcro or I need to know what Im doing wrong!
5,Wonderful Texture,"This is true ""fleur du sel,"" just from Portugal (thus ""flor de sal"") and therefore much cheaper than French or British versions. Quite ""wet,"" as other reviewers have noted, but this is what gives it its bracing mineral edge. A genuine bargain."
4,sea salt,"Wanted to try sea salt. This isn't as unique tasting as I thought it would be, but still good. A little goes a long way!"
1,Don't buy BP-511 From RitzCamera,"I bought these batteries from RitzCamera.com, via Amazon, or at least I thought I did. Ritz actually sent me the BP-511A batteries. For these, I ended up paying $69+$6.95=$75.95. But, amazon sells the same for $49 with free shipping.RitzCamera is indulging in deceptive marketing and cannibalizing amazon's sales."
1,Not For the G3 as is Stated in Amazon's Write up,"Amazon incorrectly states the following in its writeup under features: Compatible with Canon EOS 10D, D60, D30, Pro90 IS, G1, G2, G3 and G5 modelsThis does NOT work with the G3 model. The battery has a groove at the bottom which makes it impossible to fit in the G3 battery compartment. So, if you need a lithium battery for your G3, look elsewhere on Amazon. I noticed in the writeup from the manufacturer, below the Amazon description, it does NOT list the G3 as being compatible. I wish I had heeded that instead of Amazon's description, which is usually very accurate.BTW I love the Canon G3 and Amazon too."
1,The battery is NOT original Canon brand...,"The battery is NOT original Canon brand, it is ""Sterlingtek POWWER"" brand. The ad on the amazon website IS NOT correct and misleading. After ordering, they send me email explaining the truth and saying ""the ad on Amazon is not appearing correctly due to technical difficulties they are having"""
5,Kirtan bliss awaits you,"No reason to make this review any longer than it has to be by way of verbosity!Verdict: If you already know kirtan and KD, you will have (probably yet another) ""tie for first place"" in your KD collection. And if you don't already know kirtan and KD, you'll be addicted as surely and totally as all the rest of us after you've listened to this CD start-to-finish without interruption.Experienced ""users"" of kirtan and newbies alike will have the same problem that I do with all of KD's compilations; namely, the problem of trying to decide which one is the favorite! Sweet problem to have, right?!"
4,Nice Video but a couple of songs are missing,"When the video 1st came out i was ecstatic and had to buy it the day it came out. ...I attended the World Needs A Hero Tour and watching this video brought me back to the night when Megadeth came and rocked D.C. I thought the camera men did a great job of getting all of Megadeth on video, but at certain times in the concert Jimmy Degrasso seems to be emotionless and bored, and when you read the set list on the back it displays all of the songs they played that night but on the video they excluded the footage. Like ""Kill the King"", ""Angry Again"", ""Train of Consequences"", ""A Tout Le Monde"" and ""Almost Honest"". WHAT THE HELL FOR? i was extremely dissappointed at the fact that A Tout Le Monde was missing. But other than these flaws it is a great live tape and in the end they include a interview with the band at the end with mostly Jimmy and Dave Mustaine doing the speaking. If you went to the WNAH concert and enjoyed it this video is definetely worth a buy."
2,Beware of this cheap fan!!! Manufacturing defect...,"I ordered this fan with an amazon gift card and later regretted it badly. The fan came in a cardboard box which was already opened. The fan had a manufacturing defect out of the box - the blades were out of their casing and the fan made a loud noise on the first run itself. Out of frustation, wanted to return this asap, but alas! the terms clearly state that this item cannot be returned to amazon.com but only to manufacturer and the shipping would probably cost more than the fan itself!! Beware and stay away from this piece of junk!"
2,Cheaply Made,This fan gets stuck and does not turn easily. It seems like it is going to fall over any second. I usually like Holmes products but this one was well below my expectations. Because of it getting stuck it did not circulate the air in the room well.
3,Not bad... But not Good either,"Ive heard this guy twice as he was openning up for Frank Black, and He's ok. He can play guitar well, aqnd sing reasonably, but A - he's way too loud and B, he thinks he's some hot shot. Still, one could do worse then Reid Paley!"
3,MY REVIEW OF TUVAN THROAT SINGING,"Hey, my friend is doing a report for her tenth grade english class on Turvan throat singing. She has a copy of this CD. I have heard it and it is the funniest thing every! It is pretty cool that they can sing many notes at once......even if you can't understand what they are saying it is a great laugh."
5,US CW,I think this is a very nice item for my collection of soldiers from the civil war in the United States of America.
4,An album of Boyz original Christmas songs.,"This is not the cd to get if you are looking for interpretations of the classic well known Christmas songs. The only one you will get here is 'Silent Night'. The others are new songs all written by the group with help from Brian McKnight. Each song is well done with the Boyz wonderful vocal harmonies. But to me, it took a bit of listening to, before it was able to get me in the Christmas spirit, but that was only because I was not familiar with them. I have had this album now for about 5 years, and it is always played around the Christmas season, except for Christmas Day. That day is reserved for the classic Christmas songs and carols. But for any other day this is a great uplifting album to hear."
2,very poor DVD production from Kultur!,"no subtitles, audio is just 2ch Dloby Digital. Kultur should have been done much better!no complain about stage and musical"
5,christian PunX ought to be heard !,"PoCkEt ChaNgE is one awesome punx band with an amazing message. they are some of the coolest guys ive ever met. The cd is their best cd yet and should be in everyone's cd library. If you enjoy real punk rawk that you can really get into, then give P.C. a chance. If you get a chance to see them live...believe me, take it!"
5,HOLY CRAP,I WAS GUT HOOKING EVERY VARMINT I COULD GET MY HANDS ON THE DAY I GOT IT. MY FAVORITE PART ABOUT THIS KNIFE IS THAT IT COMES WITH A SHEATH SO I CAN WEAR IT OUTSIDE MY PANTS TO KEEP ALL THE HATERS OFF ME.
5,Easily installed and work well.,"Grabbed 3 for our camper, and after installing and using them, we are quite happy. They are cheap and simply made. But for something so seldom used, that's fine, they're there as a courtesy light when traveling, never the less, I can see them as being perfect for any interior application."
2,sub standard,I installed this light in my RV and the reflector stared falling out immediately. It would not stay in place so I finally threw the reflector away and currently use it with a bare bulb. I'll replace the light with a better unit when I get some time. Really cheap materials.
3,Smaller light,These are quite a bit smaller than the origional ones in my motor home but they do seem to work OK. The problem with the origional type is the short life span. The contact point with the bulb falls apart and the light is useless. I had another replacement that I put in a few years ago do that just the other day. It remains to be seen how long this one will last.
4,Fascinating Look At Senator Domenici,A very well-written book that traces Domenici's rise to Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. Wonderful insights into campaign strategies as well.
3,Lonely Planet Indonesia,"This book is great for giving you ideas as to which places to visit. But seeing now that it's 3 years out of date it has a lot of errors. I just used it in august of 2003 and all the prices are way off. Expect to pay about 2-3 times (sometimes 5-6 times) what the guide says because Indonesia's economy has picked up since the book has been released. For example: Borobudur is listed as 10,000Rp (~$1.80CDN) for entrance in the guidebook, now it's 58,000Rp (~$10CDN). They should be putting out a new one soon so if you can, wait for the next one to come out."
2,I honesty cannot believe that others gave this book 5 stars,"I am normally a fan of Elizabeth Lowell's. However, this book is certainly not for those who have out-grown the whole ""man who loves a woman yet is emotionally abusive to her"" type of novel. Not only does the ""hero"" Wolfe literally spend 300 pages verbally abusing and punishing the heroine, his sins are simply absolved at the end of the story when he says ""I love you"" for the first and only time on the very last page of the book. So realistic. This book is told almost entirely from the heroine's perspective, and Wolfe is really a brute. The conclusion of the book is also almost identical to the conclusion of ""Only His""."
5,THE FUTURE IS IN GOOD HANDS,"The very young Violinist Julia Fischer demonstrates in this recording that (to me) the future for the performance of masterpieces of so-called classical music is very bright indeed. Julia gives very sensitive, virtuosic, and beautiful in tone performances of these Russian concertos for the violin. She is rhythmically astute in the Khachaturian concerto and very gorgeous in tone in the overtly romantic Galazunov concerto. Likewise, the Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto is given a finally nuanced performance with Yukov Kreizberg leading the Russian National Orchestra splendidly.I heard Ms. Fischer in Aspen, Colorado in the summer of 2006 and was very impressed with her; this recording certainly confirms that most favorable impression.If you want to hear some great violin playing, buy this disc.By the way, the recorded sound is great-- very full and rich!"
4,Great value,"This is my second foretrex, I love it. For the price, it gives all the data that I need. It is very accurate, holds ample way points, stores tracks, will navigate, and is interface capable with an optional power cord. It has a terrible map. If you want a map, color screen, driving directions, exc... This is not the GPS for you, but if you want a SUPER SMALL, accurate, and cost effective GPS, this is it!!!!!"
5,Zhane',"This 1994 classic still sounds fresh today and was a well deserved hit. ""Hey Mr. D.J."" was the banner hit, but the real treasures on this LP are found in the middle 3rd which features 4 tunes so flawless, touching and heartfelt they guarantee this LP classic status: ""You're Sorry Now"", ""Love Me Today"", ""Off My Mind"" and ""La La La"" form a core of artistry that is still unmatched in modern soul. This debut remains a highwater mark in popular music. The effortless melding of Soul, Jazz and Hip-Hop sounds innovative and fresh, never gimmicky. Jean Norris and Rene'Neuville are two extremely gifted young women, I'm waiting on LP number 3!"
3,Synth Pop? Yep...Again and Again and Again...,"davidmahr seems to have spun another synth masterpiece. Great new sounds and songs! However grand the programming, nothing is at all new with his poorly mixed vocal that seems to grab you by the neck. The vocal itself is drab, uninviting with very little color and passion. You find your self peering around the vocal so that one might hear this pristine music.For die-hard synth or synth-pop fans this is a great addition to your collection. For those looking for something new from davidmahr vocally, you might be a bit disappointed if not frustrated."
5,Don't miss it!,"The second and best album of this fantastic brazilian band! The perfect cross between Beatles, Rolling Stones and the Who!Buy it now!!"
5,i love this stuff,"saw these two in concert, been wanting this disk ever since. not going to get in to the whole literary validity of the thing, it's just good. if your a fan it's even better. two of the best, nuff said."
2,A reggae/ska Christmas?,"That's what you'll receive here. It is certainly is better than a simple novelty album and I enjoyed the variety of styles and artists, but by the end I was not any closer to being in a holiday mood than I was at the beginning. Probably more for devoted fans of these types of music, although the end track, ""White Christmas"", by Bob Marley and the Wailers, could fit in any general collection."
5,Buying it in more colors,"I bought this watch because I thought it looked interesting and it has ended up as my favorite accessory! It was a little too big, and had to 'take it in' but that was not hard. I've recently ordered the same watch with a gold dial and brown strap. I also have to co-workers who have bought the same watch after seeing mine!"
3,"Delivery, what delivery","I'd love to review this product, but after 32 days I still havent recieved it at my business, which is open 7 days a week to recieve deliveries...."
4,receipt of purchase,"All I can say is it was a gift and it arrived. I had read the book myself a couple of years ago. Wasn't uplifting but was informative. Quite so. As an Amazon purchase, the recipient was delighted."
4,Raw and Revealing,"This book is noteworthy in that it was written by two people who were close to Dusty Springfield, former manager and friend, Vicki Wickham, and journalist Penny Valentine. This is an intimate portrait of Springfield; a raw and revealing look at the personal life she tried so hard to keep out of public view for most of her lifetime. This is a book that any Dusty Springfield fan would find very interesting and enlightening. However, the focus on her rampant drug use as well as her serious emotional problems is very sad and disillusioning. Fortunately, Springfield was able to eventually win her battle with addiction, and the last two decades of her life were mostly positive. I recommend this book to fans of Dusty Springfield.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
2,Lopsided negatively... And who on earth edited this thing??,"This is a pretty awful book... I could have written a better one... The authors portray Dusty as emotionally needy, and there is precious little in the book to suggest that the authors even liked Dusty. Whoever edited this thing should find a different line of work. It reads like a lengthy and very poorly written tabloid article! I wish that someone would write more balanced portrait of this artist. It seems that any literature on Dusty is either ""sugar-coated"" or trashy. This book falls in the trashy category. I only hope that the upcoming film of Dusty's life will be more balanced, and sympathetic towards its subject."
2,Interesting for hard core fans...but not representative,"If you are just recently discovering Dusty Springfield,I do not recommend this book, as it concentrates mainlyon her troubled personal life and does not reallytalk about her musical achievements. The contenton her musical career is almost non existant andwhen anything is mentioned its usually erroneus andinnacurate.This however is an interesting book for hard corefans that already know the musical genious of Dusty.The book reveals what a trouble and horrific personallife she had and how it obviously affected hermusical career."
3,WORTH A TRY,"NOT AS THRILLING AS THE BIRDS, BUT WORTH A TRY. GREAT CAST, WEAK LIBRETTO. I AM STILL DISCOVERING BRAUNFELS--SOME REAL GEMS IN HIS WORK!"
5,Good DVD set,My wife loved this.Sit back and have a laugh with these red wine swilling jokers.A well produced DVD set.
2,my girlfriend loves it,"my girlfriend bought this because she said it's one of the best shows on TV...I would have to disagree. It's boring,I don't remember laughing at all but maybe it's just not my type of show.it's just about a bunch of 40-50 year old people that drink wine n think they're funny.wasn't feeling it at all"
1,should get zero,"let me start by sayin i love horror movies. i am generally very easy to please when it comes to them. But this film had nothing in it making it worthy of being made. First the story is stupid. something around the line of, a family rents a summer home. While they stay there they have to care for an elderly lady who they never end up seeing. Then in a rip off of the shining the father goes insane. Etc. Youve seen it before. I forced myself to watch till the end. And the end is one of the biggest let downs in movie history.This is a terrible filmsave your money!!"
1,bad explaination to exercises,"I wish i had never bought this book. Explaination for the exercises does not help at all. Explaination like: The correct answer is D, because D is the correct answer; Answer A, B, C are incorrect because A, B, C are not correct.If you think this kind of explaination to exercise can help you understand each question, then it is a good book for OCP.Using the style in this book to comment, i should say, this book is very bad because it is bad, but some people think it is good because they think it is good.I passed OCP but did not benifet from this book."
4,"OK+, Great player but lack something","Pro:Great earbuds.Great two step bass sounds.Great soundEasy to control an learn.Size is ok.Batteries life can last 10+ hours by using two 1600mah rechargeable batteries.Anti-shock improved (I hate EXP201, what a junk of the anti-skip system, cannot walk fluently) EXP301 is better, you can carry it do little jogging, no problem on walking.Con:The price is high, compares to EXP201. With this price I can add $$ get a Sony D-cj01 or TDK mojo or others have IDs tags.As above no ID tags and back-light.Annoying resume and hold button.Now I own a HD player archos 10 jukebox, which is good. but too expensive. Thinking about returning."
1,Terrible. Had to unplug it. It doent work in Mexico.,The product is terrible. I had it plugged to my 8 ft antenna (I live in Mexico city) and the transponders that are lower than 60% of signal strenght simply never apear. A friend has a Sony Tivo with the same antenna and he gets all the channels. If you live in low receptions areas DONT buy it. I'm using a 30 bucks RCA receiver in it's place.. 300 bucks to the garbadge can.
2,overrated,"this movie is not worth the price this seller are selling it for ,finally got to see this movie because of the price this seller where selling it for ,got me interest it, man what a let down this move is overrated if you want a good clown movie watch it or killer clowns, this movie is worth about five dollars. I'm a movie collector and I'm not interest in buying this movie after watching it."
1,MORALLY BANKRUPT CLOWNHOUSE DESERVES LESS THAN 1 STAR,"Avoid this film like the plague. The sophomoric-homoerotic innuendo from the oldest brother to the younger two is very disturbed. I found this movie even more disturbing after I found out the director, Victor Salva, was CONVICTED of molesting the boy who plays the youngest of the 3 brothers in this film. Go to any search engine and type in ""Victor Salva"" and you will see the facts. This in addition to the underwear, bed-wetting, and youngest brother in the tub scene contained in the film have really made me wonder why Victor Salva is making money hand over fist in Hollywood from Powder, Jeepers Creepers & Jeepers Creepers 2. I choose to boycott any further work from a victimizer."
3,KEY WORD.......CREEPY,"Clownhouse is one of those horror films I had hired as a little girl and it kind of creeped me out, especially the cover. For one, Clowns creep me out but I'm still fascinated with them, I've always thought that they were evil behind those big smile and makeup and this film just confirms it.This film isn't excellent but I still watch and if released on DVD I'd still buy it and add to my horror collection. It's good in the creepiness department. Performances are fine, especially from a teenage Sam Rockwell.Worth a look from every horror buff!"
4,"I get UP!, I get DOWN!.....",Very unique perspective on such a complicated human condition. A must read for anyone living with or working with someone challenge by this condition.
5,Basic,Basic and and easy to use with the students that I teach. Should be added to the classroom at any level.
1,bad packaging,"The Maca powder came in the same box as the truck ball mount and tore open he Maca bag. The ball mount, which is metal, shouldhave been wrapped in bubble wrap. The Maca powder was all inside the box. Poor poor poor pacakaNavitas Naturals Organic Raw Maca Powder, Incan Superfood, 16-Ounce Pouchging."
2,"Good flavor, no effects...?","I am on my second bag of Maca, taking 2 tablespoons each morning. I like its weird bitter flavor (but then I like every vegetable on the planet, so don't go by me as to flavor). My purpose in taking it was to alleviate a borderline slow thyroid (medically diagnosed) and symptoms of adrenal fatigue (not officially diagnosed, but felt). Maca supposedly helps with endocrine functioning.However, I have not noticed any difference. It has not hurt me, but has not helped either. After reading the other reviews, perhaps I should stop and read more about it.Thanks to all commenters for sharing."
2,Woohoo What a flavor.,"This is my First review of anything on amazon. This powder has probably the most hard to handle flavor. It is so pungent that almost nothing can cover it up. The smell is indescribable. It is impossible to cover up. It says it is supposed to help with stress, but I get more irritable drinking it. I have stopped using it for the most part and feel like I wasted money. I want to at least finish the bag. I am sure it has its benefits, and it may not be for everyone, but beware the taste. Chocolate syrup is the only thing that covered it up but it took so much that it tasted like I was drinking it straight from the bottle."
4,if it tastes this bad-its gotta be good for ya!,"yea, so this stuff tastes like a root should. nasty. i mix it in with protein shakes, and then essentially gulp it down with a horrible scrunched look on my face. I definitely feel improved energy -which i never have of!- a welcome addition to my sometimes lacking diet."
2,tastes disgusting,"Even if I put only one teaspoon in a big smoothie, it simply ruins the taste. It is very bitter and dominant! I am sure it is a good product and it might even work and have lots of health benefits, so if you don't mind the taste, go ahead and buy it but I think I would buy the capsules instead (you swallow the good stuff without having to taste it)."
4,A good start.,"The item was delivered intact and in working order.The only thing I found not working was the DC lighter adaptor with the clamps-it was wired backwards-easy fix. This is old technology, however the price reflects this fact...This kit would make a GREAT start to those of you that would like to get into solar but don't have lots of money to blow on a top of the line system..... Pared with two deep cycle batteries and a Cobra 1500 watt inverter, I am able to run a TV, laptop, small radio, and even our water pump. With only 60 watts of charging available there can be down time some days depending on how long the kiddos watch the TV...My family and I live off grid and went a week and a half before the system needed a good day of Arizona sun to catch up with our use."
2,this is not what I was expecting,"Panels won't even charge the 12V battery. Checked the output of the panels and its way below the stated in product description. I checked the output in Nice sunny day.I was planning to buy few more panels but now I changed my mind.Product delivery was great, Way before the expected delivery date.Thank you for quick delivery."
2,Good starter,I knew when I purchased this item that I wouldn't be able to power much of anything off the sun. Not a low power fan or even a 13 inch tv. That takes a battery and the inverter. Will do the job with 12 volt items like a tire inflator though. Now I want a couple 200 watt panels. Not a bad starter introductory purchase.
2,Short lifetime,"Had mounted on my roof to run an electric fence to keep the deer out. Worked well for a couple years. Plastic bezels and mounting holes made them easy to mount on 2x4s, but were flimsy otherwise.After 2 years output went down quite a bit, after 4 completely dead. Amorphous silicon just doesn't hold up."
5,Does what it is suppose to.,This item was as described. I have it hooked up at my camp and is supplying the power I expected it to.
4,Came intact,I bought this as a gift. Due to the past reviews I was worried that it would arrive broken. IT DID NOT! It was still shipped by Fed Ex as of 12/2009 and arrived in one piece. none of the panels were broken. Since it was a gift (and it's the dead of winter) it hasn't been set up yet so I don't know the final outcome hence only 4 stars. But if you are on the fence due to shipping worries - don't fret!
2,Disappointing,"This c.d. was disappointing. The section with the Platters was fine. The recordings seemed to be original. The section with the Drifters, however, was not original as I would have expected. It sounded like they used electronic drums and electronic piano. It was obviously not original recordings. The beauty of Doo Wop is in the original sound. I would not recommend this c.d. for true lovers of doo wop."
2,"Good, but dated. Web sites MUCH better.","I've used this guide, as well as the ""U.S. Stabling Guide"", since about 2001. However, there are now much more up to date web sites available. I can't begin to tell you the number of calls I made to stables, in either book, that were long since out of business, or wrong phone numbers - and I used the latest versions of the books until about 2005. And I have found some really good stables that neither book ever mentioned. Some of these errors carried forward from the 2001 versions!Evidently the cost and effort to keep these thing updated is far more than keeping web sites updated - so use the web sites."
5,All I can say is WOW,"This is a great collection. Lots of songs. When I got ordered it, it was priced a little cheaper so I'm glad. Any Smokey fan would love this collection."
4,Very helpful book for begginers and not so begginers,"There are several kinds and levels of plans and one will fit Your needs. There are many helpfull hints and most important, but unfortunately not written on the book, you can use these plans together with the software Train Player to draw the plan and simulate the train running on the selected plan."
1,indoor pictures are awful!,"From an another point and shoot camera, I opted for Olympus FE-240 in spring 2007. It is not difiicult to use, but pictures taken in indoor are very much deceiving. When I compare those pictures taken by other cameras at the same place and the same time, I am really frustrated..."
5,The current standard work,"This is the up-to-date scholarly treatment of Alcibiades, an aristocratic rogue widely considered a traitor by the democrats of Athens. His prettiness and flim-flammery were highly attractive to certain elements less committed people's justice.This is the most readable account since Plato, and quite a bit more truthful."
3,Mine stopped working,"I was willing to put up with the often malfunctioning wireless keyboard, remote control and internet, because I really enjoyed the dual tuners and the ability to manage live tv, but after only 1.5 years of ownership it has quite working, and I am being told that I need a replacement. Of course, my warranty has expired, so I have to come up with the money to buy a new one. Tivo this time, of course.:-("
4,Dyno's CD is TIGHT!,"This CD contains lots of remastered music. Rappers like Poyo Loco and Oso throw down on a couple of songs. The best songs are #'s-6,9,15,17,18, and 21. Most of the other songs are tight. If you like DRF, then this is a must buy. Like Dyno said, ""shouts out to my homies in Hollister"" (song number 17)"
5,Works for me,Really liked the expandable feature since I purchased some items and needed the extra space on the return trip. Also glad I could hide the pop-up handle since I felt it was more secure not being so exposed. Appreciated the many pockets to put different items in so I did not have to move something to find an item I wanted. All in all I was very satisfied with the product and am anxious for another chance to put it to good use.
4,Everything I paid for and 5 extra bugs,"The luggage is sturdy, light, and easy to handle. No complaints here. A really good deal for 50$. But additional to the nice suitcase I received 5 flat, khaki-green, pentagonal live bugs the size of my upper thumb inside the suitcase. I found three of them before my recent trip to New Orleans and two while unpacking after I got back. yuk! I still have goosebumps when I think about them. They didn't move until I picked them up with a tissue to throw them away. Apparently they don't eat cloth because my t-shirts were unharmed. Yet the suitcase has many nooks and crannies for them to hide and I'm not looking forward to meeting more of their kind...Well, I'm a student and I'm traveling on a tight budget, therefore, I guess, it still was an ok deal.The suitcase was probably not stored in the best of storing facilities. I just wanted to let you know."
2,not a bouncing ball,"This ball is squishy, like the kind one uses after wrist surgery. The light requires a battery which wears down quickly. All told, unsatisfactory for a two-year-old."
3,Its just okay,I was really hoping for more emphasis on the radical religions during that time period. I actually had a difficult time reading and staying focused on the material....Maybe check it out at the library before you invest in purchasing it...
2,should have kept looking,"I was looking for something like this for months. It was a new product on Amazon when I did a Froogle search. Installed immediately the batteries charged right up and when I turned on the light I was disappointed. My 8x10 shed was dimly lit, lots of shadows, certainly not enough to work by. Not much more light than what my lawn lights put out. During the past two months I've used the light 4 or 5 times for a few minutes each time. After being used no more than an hour over a two month period the bulb died. I haven't even begun to look for a new one. Very disappointed"
1,Disappointing at best.,"The title of this product promises more than it can deliver. It really only gives a dim glow that cannot be considered a 'shed light'. At best, it can be used to dimly illuminate where the exit door is located in a dark shed (and you'll probably trip over anything on the floor because you won't be able to see it). There is not enough light to even recognize someone you know standing two feet away. Had I read the specs better before ordering, I would have seen that it only has an 8 watt light bulb. However, I was looking for a solar light to install in a shed and was mislead by the title. Caveat emptor."
2,Did not work for our dogs.,The bottles arrived half open and spilling everywhere as I opened the package.The spray did not do anything to relieve my dog's itchy and dry skin.She hated it and I was very disappointed it did not live up to the standardsit touted. I wished it would have worked for us.
2,Not what I thought,"I have to say I was disappointed. I might as well have given my kids sugar pills for all the good it did them. With other vitamin C's I've used I saw more energy and a bigger appetite. With these-Nothing. Plus with 4 kids this bottle is way too small and pricey. If you can, just go buy some oranges-costs less."
2,"Basic, Basic, Basic.","If you know nothing or very little about photography, you might want to look through this. However, if you have used a camera to take more than pictures of your pets and kids, look elsewhere. This book is only for the very beginners. I have been exploring photography for about 3 years now, and I saw nothing in this book that I didn't already know."
4,cute kiddos book,the story line is fun for kids. I bought a copy for my new twin granddaughters--their parents like it alot.
5,Angel a Day,"I LOVE this book. For years I have seen excerpts from it at Angel Wisdom on Beliefnet. So, I searched and searched and found the book here at Amazon. A must read for anyone who loves angels and angel wisdoms."
4,"This book has 60 rides, about half are worth riding.",Be careful if you buy this book. It is 10 years old and many of the trails have been closed.If you are looking for a place to start in Washington it covers almost the entire state.
3,Great as a follow up.,"Probably not a good intro to Non Duality or Nisargadatta, however great as a follow-up for his work. Can get heavy in some parts. Often talks about reading his other works first, before this one. Great for serious students of Nisargadatta, Non Duality and Advaita. Good translation as well."
5,"fantastic product, works with verizon pc5750","I'm using this router with the Verizon pc5750 card. It works great. I've had to reset it a few times, but that may be Verizon's fault. Very happy with this purchase."
4,Love My Nano,"I am extremely happy with my Nano purchase. This is my first experience with this type of product and I don't have anything to compare it to, but overall I feel it was well worth the price. It's compact, lightweight and easy to use, although I do wish a paper manuel was included as I had to download that off the internet. The itunes software is fairly easy to comprehend once you know the basics. The battery, when fully charged does not last as long as I expected, but for my use it is acceptable.All in all, I LOVE my NANO.."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the 1 GB nano recently, after having used an iRiver MP3 player that only held 28 songs for years. I figured it was time to upgrade and since I had heard so many good things about iPod's, I bought one.The first couple of times I used it was only about 1/2 hour each time, and it worked great. I was very happy with the purchase.However, I took it on a trip after that and the battery didn't even last 5 hours.Yesterday I turned it on and and I couldn't access my music. I would hit Menu and Music, and then the apple logo would come up and nothing. I could only listen to my music by putting it on Shuffle mode. If I wanted to buy an iPod shuffle, I wouldn't have spent so much money on this nano.Pros:Sound quality is great. Easy to use when it does work correctly.Cons:iTunes is not the easiest application to use.Player does not work on a consistent basis.Poor battery life.I'm going to have to return this player and am disappointed it didn't work correctly."
4,It's Great!!,"As soon as I bought this, I couldn't wait to get songs on it. Even though I didn't have iTunes just yet, I could play the games. It holds a lot, but the battery drains quickly if you have the light on. In settings set the backlight timer for off or 2 seconds."
3,Do more research on other brands,"I like this Nano, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. After months and months of saying I would NEVER give in to the iPod craze, I finally bought this Nano about 6 months ago when it went on sale. At first I loved it. But I have listened to it a lot, and it seems that the buttons and the click-wheel have started to slow down or something. Also, iTunes has really slowed down and messed up my computer. I recommend researching other brands of mp3 players before you give into this iPod frenzy that has swept the nation. What you get isn't really worth what you paid for. But if you're not going to use it as much as I do, and you have a Mac that can handle iTunes better than a regular PC, then you're probably going to be happier with your purchase than I am."
5,Very Satisfied,"What can I say, its an IPod. Simply great. I run, drive, etc.. with it. Very light weight. This is the 1st generation model, which I think is cooler than the 2nd generation. It is limited to 1GB, but it is all I need. I listen to my podcasts and keep up with information I never had time to before. I bought this refurbished for half the price, it couldn't be better."
3,Software Problems,"The I-pod was fine. At least as far as I know. I tried many many times to get the software loaded but it wouldn't work. My son and grandkids have an I-pod and we all have windows XP ..they had no such problems. I returned it(Thanks again to Amazon for making it a no hassle thing to do) and bought one locally and tried but, still wouldn't work. I doubt you'll have the same problem (I don't know anyone else who has had it) but if you do, know that Microsoft is coming out with one later this year."
2,ipod nano not that great!,i got my nano than first it was not downloading music than it did not work so i took it to the apple store and got it fixed and guess what! the computer did not reconise it and it just stop working!!!!!!!
3,nano the old one,"My son bought this ipod. Did not know they were coming out with a new one.A 3, because for him it is good and works fine. I don't like the price compared to that you get the old model. I think it contains the same amount of songs as my ipod shuffle. Only it is more expensive. Honest to say you can do a little more with it than with the shuffle. But my son mostly uses it to listen to songs."
2,Maximum Shame....on me,"Ok, I am the first to be in support of gorgeous women with dark eyes and exotic accents. I am also a fan of them being gagged and bound and brutalized by each other. However, when said femme fatales are interspersed with random words and phrases that do not connect to one another, and the scenes mean nothing to the characters within them, it makes for film more exhausting than all 3 of the LOTR Extended Versions back-to-back-to-back.Thanks for supporting ultra-independant film. Please create a story and a character I can understand next time, mkay?"
5,A GREAT MIX OF OLD AND NEW!,"This hymnal really reaches out to all ages. There are plenty of the old time hymns and many new praise and worship songs, too. As a pianist and choir member, I found it very easy to read and follow. It has many medleys and is arranged logically. The book I have has traveled with me for several years, now and is still holding up well. Each song has a scripture verse, also. It's the best hymnal, I have seen thus far."
5,A fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. Like Buffy,Once Bitten is a lighthearted vampire comedy that is fun to watch over and over again. Jim Carrey and Lauren Hutton do a great job here as the leads and the late Cleavon little will crack you up as a slightly effeminate vamp. The comedy is light and funny and not too over the top.The best scene is the dance seqence at the party (A precursor to Carrey's later physhical work). It Look for Megan Muhlally (Will & Grace) in a brief Role as a vampire. If you're abig fan of 80's cheese like Iam this film is worth adding to your collection.
4,Never before revealed vampire secrets!,"From other vampire movies and Nosfaratus too, you learn of such things as steaks and crosses. Even the love of innocent girls mixed with the dawning light. What if the shoe was on the other foot and the vampire was female?Basically vampires are now in L.A. They especially Lauren Hutton, still need virgins for biting purposes. Guess what Ice cream truck driver Jim Carrey is? This movie takes the Vampire mystique to new depths. I will not reveal the story as it is fun watching it unfold.However a Few things to look for; for instance what does Lauren Hutton use the gap in her teeth to pull buttons off of Jim Carrey? And just what part of the anatomy must one bite to be potently effective? Then there is the shower scene, what's a little peek among friends?So watch to see if loves conquers all or Lauren sticks Carry for the drinks."
5,Strange and wonderful,"I just got this CD and I have a feeling it won't be leaving my CD player any time soon. Mimi Goese has an amazing voice. Her work with Moby is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard, and this album comes close too. I'm looking forward to buying their other album."
2,"NOT FOR THE CHILD, but a parent MUST HAVE","These books are great comedy if you are familiar with the fairy tales they parody. However, the style is a bit ""smartmouthed"" for young listeners and readers. My son is three and too impressionable for this book (I also just saw the recommended age is 4-8)- MY FAULT! I thoroughly enjoyed reading these stories, but will wait for my son to be a little more ""mature"" to reintroduce it to the bedtime line-up. I think your child should be able to understand sarcasm in order to enjoy these stories."
3,Not as funny as I expected,I bought this book for my nieces for christmas. They are 6 and had read Lane Smiths other book called The Big Elephant in the Room and it made them laugh out loud. I expected the same from The Stinky Cheeseman but they were very underwhelmed. Maybe they are a bit too young for it.
4,Rocco's review,"This book is very confusing in the good way. If you like little red riding hood then you should read this book. This book tells you fairy tales that are wacky and weird. Every page is filled with confusion. Except one. You might have to read on your head to read the dedication! The back side will be a shock! Don't dare read the introduction. If you enjoy the princess and the pea read the Princess and the Bowling Ball story! And guess what? Jack, from Jack in the bean stalk, is the narrator!"
1,Not for children,I bought this thinking my children might like it. It is definitely not for children. It could confuse them.
2,The humor was too wry for me and my five year old son.,"My five-year-old son and I smiled maybe once or twice while reading this book. The humor was over his head, and too stupid for me. I know, the point is that the stories are stupid, but we have more fun making up our own versions of twisted fairy tales."
3,A Fun Book to Share,From cover to cover one never knows what to expect. Pages are upside down and Jack the narrator seems to cause just as much trouble. The stories in the book poke fun at all of the traditional fairy tales we thought we thought we knew by heart. Everything from the way the text is laid out to the illustration screams craziness and havoc. This is a book for an adult to share with a child (it's a little much for a child without adult guidance- that is why it doesn't get more stars). A fun book for all!
3,Children's book,I found this book funny but my 4 year old grandson didn't get it. You'd have to know the fairy tales to understand the humor.
5,The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tails,"A fantastic book not only for the young, but all ages. However, if you do not have the background knowledge in the many original fairy tales, you may fail to see the humour throughout the book. I love it!"
2,For adults and teens mostly.,I have a good sense of humor and I like the book but I'm 36 years old. I think it has too much sarcasm and dashed hopes for me to want to share it with a child. A 17 year old who wrote a customer review on this book helps support the idea that it is for teens and adults who have seen plenty of dreams and hopes shattered. Laughter is a wonderful release but let's let children dream a little longer.
5,great kids book for adults to read aloud!,My son loved this book and I read it aloud to him often. We laughed ourselves silly every time too! Buy this book and read it to your kids! A collection of classic tales like no other!
5,Teacher review,"I read this book to my students and they loved it so much I bought four copies to give as gifts. This book spoke to my chatty children and it blessed my heart to hear them take about little Gabby. This is a story that has a terrific lesson that all children can profit from.""There is a time to speak and a time to be silent and listen."""
3,You've read this book before,"Deja Dead tells the story of a forensic anthrolpologist. Set in Montrewal, Temperence Brennan is the only one who notices a connection between several murders. Inevitably, she is drawn in and becomes a target of the killer because she gets too close. Heard this before? The tale is spiced up by seemingly authentic details about forensics."
1,Still not over?,"I titled this ""Still not over"" becuase that's what I think whenever I look down at the percentage of the book I've read. I'm only at 38% and feel like I've struggled through War and Peace. I finally started this series because I love the TV version, but this book is almost nothing but descriptions of everything from the color of her toothpaste and what that particular shade means in the scheme of life to every street she drives down and what EVERY person out there is wearing. Boring! I wanted so much to have found a great new series, but this book is about 1 percent action, 99 percent adjectives and inner reflection. Yawn. Not going to reach 39% I'm afraid."
3,Not enough like Bones,I am somewhat amazed that a TV series of the caliber of Bones came out of a book series that is just so-so. I guess it really is the difference in characters that the show is able to produce that the book just fell flat on. I don't have any desire to learn more about the book Tempe. She is boring.
2,Tooo much french for me!,"I was so excited when I bought this book, I really thought it would be great. I do like Patricia Cornwell, however, I would like to have other alternatives in similar authors...but this one is not for me! I took french in college...or else I would not of been able to get through this novel. I think it would of kept my attention reinforced if only she has put as much effort into the 'medical' aspects of the novel as she did into the 'french' values and historical events of Quebec. I really tried to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it."
4,deja dead by KathyReichs Great Story,"I really like the way Kathy Reichs puts her storys together, she spins a great tale, with Temperance Brennan the forensic anthropologist who would really make a great detective, commuting between Quebec and north Carolina, There are a lot of bodys in Kathy Reicks stories, and Tempe Brennan deals with it all, usually I find the over done killing in a lot of books irritating but Kathy Reich has this down to a fine art, Tempe who lives on her own and has a daughter in uni and a rascal of a sister who both get in the way at times all add to the excitment of the plot ,then there is Detective Ryan and Detective Claudel one who loves, and one who has no time for Tempe, these characters weave through Reichs stories with the plots thickening and racing along at speed, I am up to book four and will continue to read Kathy Reichs if she continues to write like this. four stars for me. Joan"
2,Why are the ...,paperbacks CHEAPER than the freakin electronic copies? Seriously! What a RIP OFF. I buy a kindle to be more GREEN like many others and what do we get in return. RIPPED off. wow. That is the thanks we get for supporting Kindle et al... guess i'll go to the e library at that cost.
2,Deja Dead,"I could not get into this book because it was so bogged down in overly descriptive paragraphs and flower details. I must be an impatient reader because it took forever to get to the ""story"" and I felt like I had to skip several paragraphs at a time to get past the author's fascination with every little detail in the room, etc."
3,"Well paced, but lacking depth","Deja Dead was a well paced, interesting book. As a fan of Patricia Cornwell, I was curious to see how Kathleen Reichs' writing stacked up. She writes intelligently, with many interesting details of the field (although the amount of detail of some procedures got tedious). I found the characters lacking depth, however. There was so little personal information and interest given out, it was hard to connect with the main characters. Tempe Brennan is a cold, critical heroine. She often pokes fun at other people. The ending was thrilling, and not a disappointment. The book is a good read, but up to not a Patricia Cornwell novel in my opinion."
4,"Great character, with marvelous techno details!","A great book, with a nicely developed herione, who has a knack for getting into her work. I truly enjoyed the technologic aspect of her work as a forensic anthropologist. Nice background work incorporating the geography and demographics of the region. Will look forward to more works from this author."
3,An oldy but a goody,I love the Brennan series - but I'm not sure how well the books age. I read one of the more recent books and enjoyed that more. Despite this the book is still a good read and full of interesting characters.
2,Cannot compare to Cornwell!,I was not impressed with the character of Tempe Brennan. Much too shallow. She pales in comparison to the wonderful Kay Scarpetta. I found that the book was full of tiresome detail. It takes away from the excitement one should feel when reading this type of novel. Very dissapointing. I can see I shall have to wait for the next Cornwell masterpiece.
4,"Great Potential, Less Than Great Book","If Kathy Reichs can develop her writing talents a bit she should be able to write much better books than Patricia Cornwell. She certainly has a superior background (PhD in Forensic Anthrolopogy). The story is interesting and reasonably well written although it has a plot situation at the end that is far from original. Is the book too gory? I didn't think so. Reichs' impressive background would be wasted if she didn't bring some detail into the story. There is only one place where she loses control in this regard: a nine page analysis of the various cutting effects of saws on bone.All in all I came to like our heroine Tempe Brennan, and would be willing to follow her on another adventure."
4,SUPER,IN THE BEGINNING IT SEEMS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT GOES ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT ONCE YOU GET TO IT ITS GREAT READING
2,"We need more writers in mystery, less ""experts""","The trend to promote fiction by ""experts"" in their field makes for a marketing hook, but too often leaves readers wanting for expert storytelling... reading Reichs I was left seriously wanting for plot and momentum between the forensic set pieces. Please, publishers, above all else, give us books with great storytelling first -- J. Kellerman, Le Carre, Atwood, and encourage those ""experts"" to spend as much time studying writing and storytelling before they are served up to us as pre-pushed ""bestsellers""."
4,book Deja Dead,"I chose this rating because to get the best rating, the book needed to have a certification to prove the original sign of the author."
3,Didn't hold my interest,"This is the first book I have read by this author. Although I enjoyed parts, I found it difficult to hold my interest. It didn't seem up to par with many other authors I read. I will purchase another title but was disappointed in this first book."
4,I THINK FOR THEIR FIRST ALBUM IT WAS GREAT,"WHEN I FIRST GOT COOLEYHIGHHARMONY I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE WEAK. AFTER HEARING THE FIRST SONG, I WAS IMMEDIATELY HOOKED. I HAD TO LISTEN TO IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.EVEN THOUGH THAT LP CAME OUT ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO, I STILL LISTEN TO IT ON A REGULAR BASES."
2,Be careful getting this product,I just got this on 4-10-12 on last year and now it does not work at all now n danby is doing they giving me a full refund for this washer machine because it cost too much to fix it smh
1,No dimensions,It would be nice to have ALL the dimensions for this product. I can't purchase it until I know how DEEP it is.
4,Nice product - good coffee results. Easy to use.,Looks very simple and is easy to use.Cant froth milk and make coffee/espresso at same time though.Steam wand is good and makes good milk froth.For the price is pretty good _ i'm very happy and this will do until i'm ready to move up to a more expensive machine.
5,Great little kitchen tool!,"Our bacon has never been better. This preseasoned press does the job keeping the bacon flat and evenly cooked. The size of press is perfect for 4-5 pieces of bacon. We have also used it for grilled cheese sandwiches and hamburgers. The handle stays cool and the cleanup is quick and easy with warm water and soap. After using it in our home, our son who is an advid cook, requested one for his birthday."
5,Almost perfect!,"I bought this to use in conjunction with a Lodge Logic Pro 20-by-10-7/16-Inch Cast-Iron Grill, and it turned out to be an almost perfect companion piece. It is much larger than the Lodge Logic press, but not too large to fit onto the grill either direction, which is good. It's just large enough to cover two hamburger patties, or 4 short strips of bacon. It is pre-seasoned as advertised. Unfortunately, the one I bought was ever so slightly bent or warped, not enough to make a difference cooking meat but it does make it more difficult to heat when sitting on the griddle. Also, meat tends to stick to the press whether it's been preheated or not, making it more difficult to clean then the griddle itself. Altogether though, I would say this is the best cast iron press available on Amazon."
3,Too Much Glitter!,"While this costume is adorable and actually fit my tiny daughter, there was way too much glitter on the wings! It ended up all over her, the stroller, my husband, her sister, and myself! I will not be purchasing another costume online unless I have seen it in the store and there is no glitter on it!"
3,"THIS CD SOUNDS LIKE NO LIMIT, CASH MONEY",ALL OF TWISTA'S SONGS ARE GOOD BUT THE OTHER PEOPLE SOUND LIKE NO LIMIT AND CASH MONEY AND THAT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.THE BEATS GET TO YOUR SPINE.IF YOUR IN A CAR YOUR SPEAKERS WOULD POUND HARDER THAN BEFORE.IF ANYTHING TWISTA SHOULD DO SOLO ALBUMS CAUSE HIS BOYZ JUST AIN;T ON HIS LEVEL.
2,ChiTowns Finest On Only a Few Tracks,"Twista is one of my favorite artists, but this album falls way short of that of his others. The beats are way different and he is only on a few tracks. If you are going to buy this just because of Twista, don't do it. You would be better off buying the new Three 6 Mafia:When the Smoke Clears!"
5,Perfect!!!!!,Cd looked brand new case and everything!!! Perfect!!! Fast delivery plays perfect no corners bent on the cover no complaints will shop again
5,Tough Watch that Looks Great,I bought this watch for my boyfriend and he loves it. He has a very physical job and this watch keeps on looking good even though it gets drug through the occupation of him being a mechanic. GREAT watch and cleans up easy.
2,not sturdy,to start the shipping was bad enough that I got an open box and the item was scratched and bent. You can imagine using this on a 300 lb item.
2,Defective item.,"Ratchet would only lock and work in one direction, and therefore,depending on which side you use, you can only remove bolts, but can't tighten them, etc."
5,So worth it,"I struggled with the decision between the WaterRower and Concept2. I made the right choice. This machine is quiet, clean, and simple. When I'm done with my workout, I stand it against the wall and it blends into my decor (I actually keep the thing in my living room and not even the girlfriend complains).If you're dedicated enough to row daily, buy one."
4,Looks Good and rugged,"I installed the rod holders as soon as I recieved them and they look good on my boat, I like the fact that they are designed to hold both my spinniing reel poles and my baitcasters, they seam to be plenty strong with a lot of adjustment for different possitions, I looked at a few different holders and do not believe you could by a better rod holder of this configuration for the same cost as these, I would recomend these to anyone looking for this stile of holder."
4,Nice product,"Nice product, good quality, competitive price, a little tight in the socket but it should wear in with use. Looks good on the boat."
1,Monitor AC Adaptor,"I have had to replace the monitor adaptor twice, they only last less than (2) months. ProView service department refuses to communicate by email. The AC Adaptors cost $38 a piece"
2,"Soft, but not very absorbant","I bought two sets of these towels. The ad said name brand, but when I saw the label, I had never heard of them. They feel nice, soft and cushy. But they are not very absorbent. When drying my hands, after repeated rubbing and patting, my hands were still wet. My old towels (17 years old) do a much better job of drying me off quickly."
3,Thread Shrinks More Than Towel,"Suppose that for the price they are not so bad, however when put in the dryer the first time ended up with the decorative bands shrinking more than the towel material making it pucker on all the towels. I had bought 2 sets and it happened on all of them."
5,First for me,"I'm not one to read romance or historical novels. So never in a million years did I think I would ever read a historical romance. I went with a friend of mine to a book signing. As I sat there and listened to her talk...I felt compelled to read at least one of her books because she seemed like a very passionate person about her writing.My friend recommended reading this book, since it had pirates in it (and she knows I love all things pirate). So I picked it up the night of the book signing and I am sure glad I did. This book is so vivid and detailed that I could picture the characters in my mind. The story kept me hooked from beginning to end. I was sad to finish it up, b/c I really enjoyed it.I can't wait to read some of her other works. I hope they are as great as Thief of Hearts was."
4,Really liked this one!,"I used to read pirate romances alot back in the 80's and there aren't alot around anymore so I quickly scooped this one up. It is definitely different than those old pirate tales, but I still enjoyed it a lot.At first I was curious how the hero and heroine was ever going to become charming enough for the other to fall in love, but I ended up buying it hook line and sinker!It was an interesting plot twist having the hero serve as the heroine's body guard. And the relationship that was allowed to develop under these circumstances. These were definitely two people who needed the power of love, and very touching they were able to find it in one another.This was a thourghly enjoyable read!"
2,Very Average,Stevie Wonder is one of my All-Time Favorites Period.He is a Musical Genius.but This isn't his Genius here.Only two songs stand Out Sensuous Whisper&Cold CHill.His Writing is hurting on this DIsc.The Music is Lacking that Stevie Edge.After His Live Set I was Hyped for this Disc but it wasn't Happening but you can't take away The Man's Genius.
2,Stevie tries too hard,"On CONVERSATION PEACE, the Wonder man tries too hard to please everybody. The hip-hop rhythms on ""The Edge Of Eternity"", ""Rain Your Love Down"", ""Cold Chill"" and the semi-acid jazz ""Sensuous Whisper"" sound forced and artificial, while message-oriented songs like ""Take The Time Out"" and the title track sound too preachy. ""Sorry"" and ""For Your Love"" are strictly album filler, while the lovely ""Taboo To Love"", ""Treat Myself"" and the anti-gun ""My Love Is With You"" are the album's highlights (although those hip-hop rhythms pop up again on the latter song). For his next album, Stevie should just relax and be himself."
2,Not so hot.,"After getting into Stevie through FFF and Songs in the Key of Life, it is hard for me to find anything of merit in this album.However I'm simply not capable of giving anything by Stevie 1 star, so he gets 2."
2,Should have heeded reviews!,"My clock radio, too, was defective -- the motorized CD compartment door would not operate correctly. After several dozen attempts, the compartment opened only twice. The sound of the radio was terrific, though, and I was sorry to have to return it for credit."
1,Do Not Buy,"Nothing worked on the first CD Clock Radio I received. I sent it back, as directed by RCA. I then received a used, defective set on which the CD player made such a racket that it was unusable.This is a piece of electronic junk, and RCA has not been helpful."
1,very flimsy,"For costing $17 per sheet pan, I expected WAY more. These were more flimsy than a cheap pan! Very shiny, but not good!"
1,Buckles and rusts.,"This was something I added to my wish list, and I was excited to receive the stainless steel cookie sheet I wanted for Christmas. Imagine my surprise when it buckled the first time I put it in the oven. I haven't used it much for that reason. In the 4 months I've owned it, it has developed rust spots in spite of the fact that I always hand wash and towel dry it and I'm careful to use utensils that won't scratch it. I was very dismayed to learn from other reviewers that this isn't true stainless steel. If you're looking for a stainless steel cookie sheet, keep looking."
1,Not worth the money!!!,"This is absolutely the worst baking sheet that I have ever owned. Every time I put it in the oven it warps. So today I tried baking a maple pecan pie, and all the syrup ran off on one side of the pie because as soon as I put it in the oven, it warped again, and then the pie tilted to one side. So now all my pecans are on one side of the pie shell.This is definitely not worth the 8.99 that I spent for it. I'm putting it in the recycling bin RIGHT NOW!!! I wish there were some way that I could give less than ONE star."
2,"Looks Good, But","Warps in a 350 oven, next time I will look for a different brand that is a heavier gauge with rolled edge."
1,farmer's market organic butternut squash,"I HAVE BEEN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 6 MONTHS NOW. WHEN I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FROM THE US POST OFFICE, THE CANS WERE ALL CRUSHED. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED. USUALLY MY SHIPMENT COMES VIA UPS AND THE CONDITION IS ALWAYS GOOD. WHEN I OPENED THE ONE OF THE CANS I CUT THE SKIN INSIDE MY THUMBNAIL. I WAS BLEEDING FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES. I FEEL THAT AMAZON SHOULD COMPENSATE FOR THIS INJURY."
1,"A book that is neither worth the money, nor the time","Unfortunately I was requried to buy this book for a class. An absolute waste of money. Nothing is covered in any sort of detail at all, while the pages are dedicated to output from compilers. For an example, the information covering file Input and Output consists of a single paragraph. And it's wrong. C++ Primer Plus is a much better alternative. It's cheaper, bigger, more correct, and is actually a useful book. I want my money back Barbara! (And I suspect that you're the one who wrote the first review and that you also paid someone to write the second.)"
4,The real collection,"As someone who has followed the Temptations for 40plus years I looked forward very much to the release of this collection,and as far as collections go it's really good,one thing you will find though is that a lot of the early songs like The way you do the things you do,My girl and others are in mono and yet the original albums when they were released on cd these songs were in stereo,the version of old man river on this collection for me wasn't as good as on the Temptaions live album,I definitely feel you should still have this collection but albums like Temptations sing Smokey,Temptin' Temptations,and just about all of their 1964-1975 music is timeless after they left Motown for a short period in the late 70's and returned they have never seemed quite the same but occasionally they'll do one like the Phoenix rising cd which gave us Stay,but hey I'm a fan for life just in a different way..."
5,"Really the ""Ultimate"" collection...","Though I have to agree, stereo versions of these recordings would be nice, traditionalists would say that the released versions of these songs (the early ones, anyway) were mixed in mono. But aside from that, this is really just a fabulous collection, taking the listener through all the phases of the Temps. Maybe the only thing I would ask for is the full 14 minute version of Masterpiece, but I have that on another cd...."
4,Very Detailed,"I liked this book, anyone who is interested in training or is a trainer they should have this in their library."
3,Womens strength training anatomy,"Well I really would like to review this book, it seemed excellent and I had heard really great things about it - even from my gym instructors.However after over a month I still havent received and now I have to haggle with Amazon about it. Boo !"
2,BUYING SIGHT UNSEEN.,"I had seen the ""male"" version of this book and was very impressed. It did have both male and female illustrations in it. However, it really was primarily a male orientated book. So I bought this book. I find it wonderful but, sadly incomplete. No arms, chest or shoulder scenes. I know I can find it in his other book. But I feel cheated since I bought this book sight unseen. I wanted it as a gym resource book. Now I need to get another one. DONT BUY IT SIGHT UNSEEN."
4,This book is good for people who like gym classes,"I agree with everyone else that Strength Training Anatomy is a better book for strength training, being more comprehensive and including all major muscle groups. I really do not understand why he omitted arms, chest and shoulders for women and he is a bit skimpy on back exercises in this book as well. However, this book gives some useful information regarding injury prevention for women. It is also a very good book for someone who likes those gym classes as a lot of body weight bearing exercises are included explaining which muscles are being targeted exactly. Overall, nice edition to my Strength Training Anatomy, but not quite as good."
2,What about women's UPPER BODIES?,"I give this book 2 stars because half of it is missing. Don't expect to be able to use this book to get the nicely toned arms, chests and shoulders so beautifully illustrated here because there are NO upper body exercises included at all. The half of the book there is, IS very good, with beautiful and clear illustrations and easy to undertand. (I do wish that the sketched woman working on her ""adductors at a machine"", on page 69, had been drawn wearing an exercise bra.) I should have read the other reviews here. Now I'm going to buy Strength Training Anatomy to find out what's been left out. *Sigh* it seems like another chapter of the same old story: women are always having to wait longer for women's versions of products and then paying extra for them. And just like clothing--less material, lower quality and higher prices. Hey! Maybe these guys don't want us to have strong upper bodies! That way we could punch them out for pulling stunts like these."
1,Totally 'armless,"It is the most beautifully presented book, with excellent diagrams and a great deal of detail for the content that is presented. Bewilderingly, it does not address exercise anatomy for the arms, shoulders or chest.If it was a complete book, presenting information for the whole body, it would get 5 stars easily. As it stands, I am amazed that it got published with such glaring omissions."
1,Agree with first review!!!,"I own & love Frederic Delavier's ""Strength Training Anatomy"", so when I saw this one at a local bookstore, I anxiously leafed through it, hoping it would be of a similar caliber. I was very disappointed to see that apparently, women do not have shoulder, chest & arm muscles (see table of contents)! Guess they are marketing this book to women who are trying to spot-reduce thighs, butt, & abs. I don't buy into that myth and thus did not buy the book. BOO, HISS!!!"
4,Countess Dracula DVD Review,"Countess Dracula is one of the best Hammer productions, with good production design, decent costumes, and a fine musical score. The film is loosely based on the life of Elizabeth Bathory who was a real Hungarian countess in late 16th and early 17th centuries. According to history, the countess and a few of her servants murdered several hundred girls, but using blood to retain youth is just a fairy tale. They were ultimately caught and the servants tried and executed; however, the countess was not tried but kept in prison until her death."
3,Good ole 70s Female Vampire movies,I'll admit I bought this to see some 70s Vampire babes and it delivered. Not vintage classics but I enjoyed them anyway.
2,heat diffuser,This was a waste of money. Truly sorry I brought two of them. They smoke and stinks. Try something else
1,Not even worth what little I paid for it,"Considering the price, my expectations were not very high. Unfortunatly this product failed to meet even the lowest of qualifications. As mentioned in other reviews, when hot the wooden handle smokes, and emits an odor. Eventually, the handle just fell off all together. If you need a diffuser for about 2 weeks, and don't mind the smell, this is the one for you!"
1,DO NOT BUY - BURNS,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. Luckily Amazon is going to send me a refund. I used this product and within minutes on a low heat on a gas stove top, I smelled smoke and noticed the diffuser was burning. It is now completely useless and discolored. Waste of money and time, I guess you get what you paid for. Do not waste your time trust me!"
4,Works but doesn't last long,"I've run through maybe 6 of these over the years. I have a propane stove and eat oatmeal every morning, so I use the diffuser daily, and it works great. Propane burns hot, and the diffuser allows me to lower the cooking temp enough to avoid scorching anything that needs a long simmer. However, after a year or two of use, the thing pretty much starts to disintegrate, leaving tiny black burned shavings under the burner after each use. And then it's time to replace it. They aren't expensive, but it is a bit of a pitb, so I'm going to try a cast iron one next."
3,Rodney Oh NO,"Well, to me this cd wasnt that great at all. If you'd ask me how it was i'd reply with an ""well it was aiight"". Rodney O and Joe Cooley have been way past their ""hay day"". The Presence of young rapper ""Dedope"" was the only standout on this cd. Look for his solo ""aint no questions""."
2,"""Iwo Jima and the Flag""","Author Dan van der Vat assertion that the Iwo Jima flag raising was a media ""put-up job"" is beneath contempt. It is laughable he wants the reader to believe AP civilian photographer Joe Rosenthal requested combat Marines to climb back down Mount Suribachi to obtain a larger flag, and according to the author,for the sake of the camera, the Marines did so and then raised the flag. Rosenthal never made such a request. The actual comments of Joe Rosenthal regarding that day are available on the internet. ""Flags of our Fathers,"" by James Bradley provides a credible account of the Iwo Jima flag raising."
2,"NOT ""card stock"" - thick paper--maybe.","I've been making my own cards using Staples' Photo Greeting Cards. When I went to get more of Staples' cards, I found they were sold out of their own product, so I opted to buy this Avery 'card' paper instead. I thought, because of the Avery name, the product would be comparable or of superior quality. BOY was I disappointed! I might as well have used 24 lb. paper I had at home. The Avery paper in this package is NOT cardstock, which is what I expected for a greeting card type of product. I'm Very disappointed, particularly because I expected better of Avery."
2,Avery Greeting Cards,Envelopes don't seal. I purchased 3 pkgs of 30 and am not happy with this purchase.
5,Good product. Works well with my Hallmark Card Program.,My wife and I make many cards using our Hallmark Card program. These card stocks and envelopes work well with our program and printer.
2,Fairly good for an imitation.,"Exactly the same thing has been done more than 20 years ago much more efficiently by the British Henry Root (""The Henry Root Letters"").I expected to find some reference in the ""Idiot Letters"", but found none...As to the book in hand, it has a couple of funny ideas, but not a lot of imagination. The writer ought to have elaborated on some of the most stupid and/or humorous answers, which would have added another dimension to the joke. As it is, it lacks a lot."
5,Two Great Dark Comedies,"These are two of my favorite movies. A perfect blend of classic horror and comedy. Both movies star the amazing Vincent Price, Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre. If you like any of these actors or good comedy with your horror films then you will love this disc. Also, Tales of Terror has The Black Cat which is also a dark comedy, although a bit more dark. The chemistry between Peter Lorre and Vincent Price will not disappoint. Keep the faith, dExtrosien"
2,Price,"I love these old ""Horror"" movies. With all the other ""Midnite Movies"" being so inexpensive, this one better come down in price if they expect me to buy it."
1,Did not perform to my expectation,"I wanted to nail plywood on concrete slab floor. I bought the Porta 460 nailer gun and 2-1/8 Inch nails. I did test run, and found that only 1/3 of the nail could penetrate the concrete and the nails get bend. I tried with 3/4"" plywood. I guess these nails may be used for 1-1/2"" thickness woods. Later I had to switch to 1-3/8"" inch nails."
5,splendid!,"What a beautiful record! Okay, let's just say it..it's not country. WHO CARES! (and that's coming from a hard core country fan...and I mean hard core, not this pop divvil we hear today.) But more than anything, I'm a fan of good music. Bottom line: you CAN'T NOT love this CD. The songs are some of the best ever written and the production is AMAZING; lush, organic and without a lot of high-tech gobblygoop. The two new songs on the album (Season for...and Forever Xmas...) not only hold up...they're destined to become classics themselves. Kudos to Ms. Womack for taking this risk. In the past, I haven't been much of a Womack fan. That's now changed, this girl is a true artist. This is truly a SPLENDID record. Give yourself a treat and buy it."
4,so sad,"author presents a less than hopeful view of humanity's survival unless drastic steps, political and economic,are recognized and embraced. When read along with viewing the recent (summer 2006) movie, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" I came away discouraged. However, I may just be reflecting an old man's view that, ""the world is going to .... etc""). However, I do NOT subscribe to literalist view of biblical end of times theology!"
2,Eh.,"Perhaps I was spoiled by reading J. Diamond's terrific ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" before this book, but I didn't find ""A Short History"" particularly compelling or noteworthy. First of all, the book is hardly a ""short history of progress."" In focusing solely and briefly on four ancient civilizations, Wright's book sorely lacks heft. Too many critical details and events in the evolution of Man are ignored. There is a boatload of facts regarding our progress over the centuries that simply is not reflected here. The result is akin to having all of one's dishes removed just as one is about to begin enjoying a large, bountiful feast. What we are left with is a rather shallow narrative that barely satisfies. Wright is a decent writer, but the time spent reading this book would be better spent checking out Diamond's work instead. You'll enjoy a far more provocative and complete examination of the same subject. This is history for Dummies - short, shallow and way over-simplified."
4,"cynicism, and collapse","Following Jared Diamonds work in 'Collapse' this book once again sounds the alarm that chaotic progress and plundering of resources will lead to the end of progress. The idea here is first to question the very notion of 'progress' and to question what is 'civilization' and what is better or worse. The question is posed ""who are we to judge what is better"" an old moral relativist argument. From there we are told that history is in fact proving that almost all 'progressive' societies failed, such as the Greeks or Easter Island, or basically any high civilization of the past. Since the past is a history of failure, how can we ourselves suceed? We can only suceed by ending capitalism and not destroying the environment. A short, fun book whose premise and conclusions are totally wrong and irrelevant.Seth J. Frantzman"
5,Who Said that white boys can't JUMP?,"Check out this release and you will discover one of the best bands of the seventies. This rocking and soulful group from the Motown hitmaking stable had no equals at the time. Their turn on the classic ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"" is a treasure and the exceptionally long ""Ma"" (earlier recorded by The Temptations) is a tour de force.These boys didn't need to take a backSTREET...OOPS! I meant ""BACK SEAT"" to anyone."
4,It is the best song the Spice Girls have ever writen!!!,Most of the spice Girls songs are not as good as Goodbye. (I think) but I absolutley LOVE this song! I went over to my friends house and she played it for me and I coundn't believe that the Spice Girls wrote it. Wow! I don't like most of the songs that the Spice girls wrote before but this one is great!!!
3,Lost profits for Columbia,"We all know that Last Train Home is a cool song, but unfortunately there is little else on this CD that is even half as strong. Most of the record sounds as though it was written specifically for live playing, energetic and full-tilt but with little musical substance.I also found the record to be pretty inconsistent musically. Some songs are reminiscent of Linkin Park, but other sound like a blend of Blink 182 and AC/DC. This is partly enhanced by the singer - who seems to have a really good voice but insists and forcing that punkish sort of Sum 41 thing into his vocals.It's certainly not a bad CD, but I don't really hear anything on it that indicates they'll ever really break through to the mega-career level."
4,could've been better,"This is good, solid, sophmore effort by a band that has almost unlimited potential. If their first album FSOP did not exist I could've given it 5 stars. That's the only thing I can compare to, not linkin park, hoobastank, or incubus like a lot of reviews had. Hey it sounds good but it's just the sound and style I was used to from FSOP. Also, sorry to all the good charlotte fans but why oh why are the whiny vocals of bengi on here.Meanwhile check out the band ""simplekill"" from south florida"
2,Only worth $4.00,I have to admit that their first was good but they should have stopped after that. This cd is hardly worth the 16 dollars people are selling it for. Every song sounds the same one after the other. Lostprophets disappointed me greatly. But on the brighter side of things there are a couple of good songs on here but thats about it. Not for a rock fan.
1,What a fake band!,"I saw the Lostprophets when I was visiting Cardiff, Wales a few years ago. They had played funk metal guitars(Ibanez and PRS), DJ scratching, jazzy breakdowns and wannabe Mike Patton/Brandon Boyd vocals. They also looked pretty American for a couple of Welsh kids, complete with baggy pants, visors and Adidas. In my opinion they where nothing compared to SCIENCE-era Incubus.Now here they are with Start Something. I've seen their guitarists in magazines now playing Gibson SG's and Fender Tele's for that retro garage rock touch. They also have dropped the nu metal look and abandoned it for the current hardcore/metalcore look(tighter faded jeans, plug earings, studded belts, moppy dyed black hair). They've also laid claim to Iron Maiden and Judas Priest as major influences. Might that possibly have something to do with the renewed interest in thrash metal thanks to bands like Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage?(...)"
3,snowflake bently,This is an story that I already knew and I thought it would be interestingfor my7 yr old granddaughter.I was disappointed to see very little text .It did appear to be for a younger child who is not into reading their own books.. It was a Christmas present and I dont know if it has been read yet .It did arrive quickly and in fine condition. It is just my perception of what it would be that was offf.
2,Boring! An adult's idea of a good children's book,"I cannot fathom how this book won the Caledecott award. It is excruciatingly boring. Yes, it's very informative, but there is absolutely nothing fun or fanciful about it. It reads like a science textbook. This book is terribly dull and although it was given us as a gift (by a grammar school teacher of course!) I wouldn't inflict it on my children and dontated it to the library. The woodcuts are lovely which is why it got two stars instead of just one."
5,Snowflake Bentley is a great biography book for children!,I needed a children's biography book and bought this one on a whim. It was the best thing I could have done. This book is a true story that is told in a storybook format. The illustrations are phenomenal and they add a beautiful touch to the story. I feel this book is directed towards a K-4 grade level but think it could be used for any level. What a great way to introduce a science lesson on weather or how water freezes/crystallizes.
3,average toy,"This toy is cute, and loved that we were able to screw it down to my son's fort. However, the lack of magnification and cheap plastic parts decrease it's value."
4,great for the imagination!,"This is called a telescope, but no it doesn't magnify. With that said, my 4 year old loves it! She doesn't care that it doesn't magnify because she has an imagination! It is capable of being pulled in and out of stand pretty easily, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I would actually rather it be stationary, which is what I thought I was getting, because I am afraid it will get taken off and lost somewhere or broken. It was a great addition to our new swing set at a good price! I would buy it again!"
3,Great one of my favorites groups of all time,Classic rare earth with that rich rock soul sound but like other rare earth fans trying to find the 23 minute verson of get ready on cd a must for any hard core 70s music fan
3,nilbog!,"Nilbog is goblin spelled backwards! Some of these scenes are pretty hilarious because of how low budget they are. But all in all, very entertaining."
2,stupid sequel,"After checking out the troll dvd, I would have to say that the 2nd movie is one of the worst ones that I have seen in a while. Not only was the acting terrible, but the woman that played the goblin queen was way to weird for my taste. For those out there that have seen these movies, stick to the first one indefinitely."
5,Can't get enough!,"This CD is addictive! The rhythmic chants set to music grab you and won't let go-- and because they are musical affirmations of spiritual truth, that's a very desirable thing! I have played my copy of this over and over and over again.""Join Together"" is my favorite track because of the deeply layered instrumentals and primal rhythms, but all of the chants will grab you. If you facilitate a spiritually-focused group and want a sure way to bring the group together in a cohesive whole, just put this on and encourage movement!"
5,Must add to your collection,"I can't under stand why this movie wasn't bigger than it was. Great story line, great acting, and great action. A must see for all action movie buffs. Highly under rated!"
5,The Kingdom,High impact movie with fast moving pace at times when action is called for. A must see for those who like fast hitting action movies.
2,Not worth the $$,"I got a good workout with this DVD, however she demonstrates ONE routine, and does it FOUR times. I could have looked up a 5 minute routine on YouTube and played it four times, instead of spending close to $20 on this item."
1,What an awful recording!,"I'll have to chime in and agree with just about all the other reviewers: this recording is *awful*. I bought it some years ago for ""The Peaceable Kingdom"", which I had sung in the University of Chicago Glee Club many years previously. I had loved it then, and when I got this record my biggest disappointment was in thinking, ""Oh dear, I guess I was wrong then: Randall Thompson is a pretty poor composer."" Listening to this record (and not comparing it to others) might convince you of this too - which would be an enormous disservice to Thompson, who *is* a pretty good composer. You'd never know that from this disk. AVOID! AVOID!"
4,great book,Concepts in this book will prove helpful to artists of all levels in one way or another...simply a must have!
2,Poor Reception,I purchased 3 of these watches to keep track of my sons in the neighborhood. They are not small but rather quite bulky (especially on a 7 year old). The antennea that flips up looks as though it could be easily broken. If my sons attempted to throw a baseball with this watch on I'd be surprised if it stayed on the wrist. My main complaint though is the reception. They worked fine in and around the house but as soon as you walked around the corner the reception faded and within a 1/4 of a mile there was no reception whatasoever.
5,great knife,it is a schrade which is a good brand and I was pleased with it. It does a good job cutting and it is smaller so it is easier to hold on to and work with than a larger knife.
3,"Good knife, poor sheath","Knife came nice and sharp. Looks decent, seems to hold an edge, and is comfortable to use.The sheath is a pain in the ass and is embarrassing because it takes forever to put the knife away."
3,Schrade Fixed Blade Knife,"Knife is good metal, but I was very disappointed to learn that all Schrade knifes are made in China. The handles are Delron, an injected molded cheap plastic. I replaced the handles with Diamondwood immediately. I am satisfied with the knife after replacing the cheap handles and getting over the ""made in China"" issue."
5,worth it,"This is a great product. I've not gotten to put it through it's paces on a fishing trip or at the camp . . . but from what I've seen and done with it so far, it's a great knife with a sharp edge, comfortable handle, and a good ""feel"". The sheath is nicely designed and a perfect compliment to the knife. Well worth the price."
3,it is not made in the usa/ bear kinfe co is made in usa,it need to be made in the usa so move the co. back to usa! So if you are look for a usa made knife look at the bear knife co. I will byi all
5,Good buy,"This nailer worked very well, just what I needed at the time. I would recommend it to anyone looking fora roofing nailer."
2,Lame and Poorly Edited,"First of all, I wish someone had proof-read this. There were many errors where the word was spelled correctly, but it was the wrong word for the context. It appears the pictures were simply scans of the pages since the text on the pictures started in some weird places. I also found the reading lame. It was so basic. I'm sorry I spent my money on it."
2,Squirm,"Squirm is about a town who gets hit by a storm, lighting strikes, and it causes the worms to become bloody thirsty. The movie is very slow paced but the ending does have some good moments. I'd probably never watch it again but the price is right if your a collector of dvds."
2,Attack of the Italian Spaghetti Monsters,"It may have been a chiller back in the 70s, but this classic has turned into a tongue-in-cheek comedy. There were so many flaws in the plotline...cooking spaghetti under candlelight with no electricty in the town...spaghetti that mimicked to so-called worms that squirm in and out of your body. And how do you make hot coffee with worms in your water pipes and no power? This one drags along so slowly, you may drift off. The special effects are far from special, and the acting is horrendous...maybe that's what made this a horror film. You won't squirm to the worms...you'll be wigglin' and jigglin' after it's over. Only 2 stars for a dated film."
2,Like Worms? Squirm's got'em...,"Touching tale of a Northern boy buying antiques down south in rural Georgia. He meets a sweet teen red-head and her neighbors, a mush-mouthed old worm farmer and his mealy-minded teen son. The Northern boy's presence sparks resentment in Fly Creek, where the worms live. Highlights of the film include writhing worms slithering through shower heads and unudulating en masse wherever they can, in bathtubs, living rooms, inside perishable human beings... Everything about this film is repulsive. When the film was made (mid-1970s), Jimmy Carter was still Governor of Georgia."
3,with the manitou and the exorcist one of the best horrors,"one of my 1 st horror films on video tape ever around1982-83 ,the hole family came watching and squivered with the worms , i found even the kit -statuette in resin- amazing lifelike if well made"
1,NO springs!,"I saw this on MST3k's penultimate episode, and I don't think I'd be able to stomach it any other way. Anyone who did see it there will instantly recognize this review's title, in case you're wondering. The cast includes the most Southern people in the world. I think these people should be in Guiness! Basically, the plot is that a storm knocks down a power line that sends all its electricity into the ground. Instead of being instantly fried, these worms become millipedes and start attacking people. Into their midst strolls a wormy (pun intended) antique dealer from New York who plays Nancy Drew and tries to find out why there are so many skeletons around. Also look for R.A. Dow (in his only film appearance) as the local worm dealer's son. He spouts such classic Southern lines like ""Now you gonna be da worm face,"" ""You ain't got no meat doh boy,"" and ""I told you, it's a ZOOprise!"" Crow puts it best: ""There is a lesson to be learned from all this. Never go to the South for any reason."""
1,"Worms...killler worms?! Oh, come on!",All I can say is that they all look like a bunch of groups of wet all-bran...and they don't get anybody for a whole hour and then some.....Really boring.....
5,A Gem,The quality and design of this time piece far exceeded my expectations. I was surprised to find the watch displayed in a handsome hinged wooden box. This is a wedding gift to my future husband. I know he will be thrilled with the presentation. I highly recommend this watch to those wanting a classic vintage look. The circa watch appears to be more valuable than its cost. I thoroughly recommend this watch.
1,Organize for disaster,"This book does cover exactly what the title says. It is, however, set at a sixth grade reading level and geared for people who don't have much real life experience. If you are concerned enough about disaster preparedness to consider purchasing this book, you more than likely all ready know everything this book covers. Don't waste your money here."
5,Another enjoyable Ray Conniff collection!,"""Love Theme from The Godfather"" and ""Alone Again (Naturally) is another super collection of the talents of Ray Conniff from the 1970's. First rate set by the Collectible CD people. If you purchased the albums back then the audio quality is wonderful! It's another excellent CD of Conniff's great work!!"
2,Trouble at the feed holes,"I've had this feeder for about 9 months. Construction and material quality is great. Unfortunately, the birds don't always have success getting the feed from the holes. After eating a couple of seeds it creates a concave area where the seeds don't drop into. The gold finches end up going from hole to hole until they fly away. If I shake the feeder it will start the feed again, but only for a short while. I've decided to try a wire mesh feeder."
1,too small for 17 in laptop,Would be fine if it fit - too small for a 17 and too big for a 16. What a waste
4,Bull Vine Pattern,"Great laptop sleeve. It's a good fit for my MacBook Pro with just enough space to squeeze in the video adapter. I only gave this item 4 of 5 stars because of the color. It looks black and white in the photo, but it's really more of a navy blue/off white. The coloring is not bad, it's just not the black and white I expected. The inside is a cool bright pink."
1,Defective card,I have always used sandisk CF cards. I bought this for my new Canon 40D and right away I started to see that one out of every 100 images was corrupted. First I thought it was the new camera but soon the camera started to freeze on me when in continuous shooting mode. I thought I might have a bad copy of the 40D! Did some research and found that the same issue was faced by others and the issue was the card and not the camera. I replaced it with an EXTREME III 4GB card and i have not seen the problem since even in continuous shooting mode. I'd recommend sticking with EXTREME III series for now!
5,So far it is fast and reliable,"I still think CF cards are a little overpriced. Nonetheless, I bought this card for a friend using a Canon EOS 40D and he is more than satisfied with it."
5,The Best Book on Bread in Print,I learned to bake bread from this book. My husband picked it up at a bookshop that was going out of business over 15 years ago and I treasure it among my most precious cookbooks.Anyone who has never tried baking bread should read this book and follow the recipes. The text is simple and enjoyable and the recipes are uncomplicated. The results are spectacular.
2,Good but lacking,"I did find the book helpful for some types of wood, however, I also found that some of the discriptions were verbatum to another book that I had. I am not sure who copied who. This book did not list all the common names of some of the more available species where it went overboard on some very obscure species. I also found it lacking in the number of species that it covered. I have many species in my shop that are not mentioned anywhere and they are readily available commecialy."
1,WARNING,If you like the song Tears do not by this cd. There is LOUD static in the begining of the song.
5,WOW!,"My little Smurfette and I use this manual quite often. If you wanna have a good time when the kids are at the sitter, you need to use this book. It is the smurfiest thing since...I just don't know. There are no words. Totally hot and erotic, with little pictures for you to enjoy! Like other reviewers before me, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one for newly weds. Get your kicks while you're still young enough to get em!Smurf this book now, and don't forget to hide it in a safe place, away from your little smurfs! Trust me, you don't want them to smurf this!"
2,Not quite what was expected.,"Mostly just common sense, aside from the information about youthful experiences, creeped out by that information."
2,Terrible,I give this novel two stars because of the excellent adventure element. However for a while I thought George Bush had written it with all the grammatical errors and subject verb disagreements.The entire premise makes little sense. The character jumps right into his remarkable situation without any pause or problems with adaptation.The part about the Appalachian community hiding out from the rest of the country takes away from the story line and is utterly preposterous.
4,"As long as my pets are fed, I'm good.","I used to putPurina Beneful Healthy Radiance, 7-Poundsin this feeder. These kibbles come in different shapes so it would get stuck pretty often. My dogs learned to poke at the hole to get the food to come out and I had to stick my finger in there a couple of times to get the food to spill out. However, upon investing in some higher quality food (Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Fog Food 35 Pound Bag), the food came out a lot more smoothly. These kibbles are all round so it hasn't been as bad. Still gets stuck sometimes but as long as I don't hear my dogs crying or in frustration, I'm satisfied. The bowl part of this feeder is bigger than the other feeders I have (Petmate Le Bistro 5-Pound Feeder with Microban, Dark Taupeso that's better for my German Shepherd mix."
4,Music from the Hart,"I imagine this will be one of the fastest rising new country singers this year. The music is good, she has a fantastic voice and I look for her to climb the charts quickly."
2,Excellent Used CD,This cd was in perfect condition. It had no scratches and was as good as new. I look forward to ordering more cd's from this seller in the future.
2,Not happy,"I have owned the elite series for some time. I am not sure how the new redesigned dumbbells work, but these have problems! Depending on what excersises you do the pins slide out, making them very unsafe. Another major problem is the plates are very delicate! You can't even mildly drop these on a rubber mat after a bench press because the plates flex, which makes the pins almost impossible to set. Very disappointed , they are currently for sale."
1,What the hell happened?,"I have been an avid Oscar Lopez fan for years and own all of his Narada studio albums. My Destiny is by far the worst one. Being a composer/flamenco student myself, I looked to Oscar Lopez, Armik & Strunz & Farrah as mentors in the art. All of Oscar's previous Narada releases are a must have. Heat, Seduction and Armando's Fire contain truely magnificent compostions. My Destiny has only 3 tracks worth listening to:Trk. 4 - My Destiny - elegant intro followed by soulful melody.Trk.11 - Emotions - relaxing rhythmTrk.14 - Changes - faster paced piece"
5,You'll Love It !,"I take alot of photo's, and have had an Olympus for the past 3 years. The Olympus 2.1 has never let me down so I was hesitant to not buy another Olympus. But when I started my search for a 4 Megapixel camera the Canon A-80 caught my attention. Just about every review I read was positive, and it had features no one else had. After I bought this camera I saw what everyone was raving about. The picture quality is second to none. I've taken pictures outside,inside all lighting and even on the auto mode they come out flawless.It has a solid quality feel. The swivel display is super, you'll wonder how you ever got by without one. I was at a concert and took pictures over everyones heads with it. I could never had done it with a standard display.Buy this camera, you won't be disapointed. I'm sure this camera will give anyone years of great photo's. The only things I bought was a camera bag ,256 flash memory card and rechargable batteries. Get those few items and your set to go."
3,Losing Faith in Canon,"Lifelon Canon customer (I have had an EOS SLR for about 10 years now with no complaints). This camera is absolutely wonderful, but I'm concerned about the quality. I've had it about a year, and it's been great up until recently when the lens got buggy. The memory card door and battery doors are now loose, and the lens has trouble sometimes closing. At this point in the digital camera game, I'm ready to upgrade to a digital SLR, but I'm ready to look at brands other than Canon."
3,First digital camera purchase,"I purchased this digital camera as my first experience with the 'digital' world of cameras and photos. Loved the digital end of taking and having photos. Purchased rechargable AA batteries for the camera as I apparently loved to take photos... more and more and more. I did experience an issue with the battery cover not closing all of the way, causing the batteries to not be able to power the camera and had to return it three times for repair. I was not 'rough' with the camera as any camera I have had has been a major part of my life. Unfortunately, it was never actually repaired when I returned it to Canon so needless to say I never used the camera again. I did get to use the camera for about 2 years though but in the era of items of higher quality and expectation of 'life' of product, I was disappointed it didn't last longer."
2,"Nice pictures mostly, but flash is bad","I was always told that the flash is the most important part of the camera, and this flash is good, but sometimes too good. I've had several experiences in the few months that I've owned this camera when I've taken pictures of friends, only to look at the playback and see that they are totally bleached out. Then I'll retake it without a flash and it will be too dark. I've tried several settings and haven't found a solution. It's disappointing because there have been times when after having everyone stand there for several pictures, I still don't end up with a good one and have to give up."
2,Menus and Functions not very intuitive,"So far I've taken some wonderful snapshots using the automatic settings. Using the ""functions"" and ""menus"" has been a challenge-- there are too many buttons: set, menu, function, display for a gadget that is, for the most part menu driving."
4,"Great quality, small display",This camera takes terrific shots and is easy to operate. The memory cards are affordable and the feature set is robust enough even for advanced photographers. The swivel screen is a nice addition and I have used it more than I thought I would. The only thing I would change would be to increase the display size to that of the competition (this kept me from giving it 5 stars).
3,Measure Pro Installation Kit,The package was open when I received it. The drill bit was missing. The larger of the two jigs was warped.
1,too small,"I'm sure that this is a good product, but it is way to small for the drawer pulls that I have"
5,Worked like a charm!,This item worked well for me. It made intalling knobs and handles very easy. Would order similar items in the futre.
5,Great pens,"Have been using Papermate Profile pens - these are lighter weight , easier to write with and just as nice for less money. Very happy with these ~"
4,"Very good, but not great","This is a nice set of disposibles and offer a nice veriaty of colors. The only thing I have noticed with these, is if you are used to the Gel G-2's, these seem not to flow as smoothly, although this isn't enough of a draw back to keep me from buying more sets."
4,Good for school,"I bought these pens for my 11 year old daughter. They seem to work great for her schoolwork (smooth line, no blotches no smudges). She was disappointed that they didn't have more ""pretty"" colors. You can find similar sets at your discount stores for less money, but this pack had colors I couldn't find in the discount store sets."
2,Disappointed,"The colors of the pens I received do not match the colors in the picture. Plus, five of the pens are so similar in color I could not tell them apart (three looked black and two looked dark grey). As far as writing goes, they seem nice. I used a Sarasa Zebra pen in a doctor's office once and loved it. I need many different colors for studying though so these do not meet my needs :/. I recommend: Pilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Rolling Ball Pens, Fine Point, 8-Pack Pouch, Assorted Colors."
5,The only solution for high resoloution digital storage,"From the beginning, my major fear was that the microdrive would use so much battery power that it wouldn't be worth the space it offered. While battery life is dependent on the digital camera/battery you have, my experiences have shown this drive to take little more power than a regular static memory card. With many cameras offerring upper resoloutions of 2048 x 1536 or over, image sizes can range to as large as 1.5 megs a pic. While a 256 meg static memory card would be nice, it is prohibitively expensive when compared to this drive. I have had nothing but good experiences with it, and would reccomend it to anyone with a compact flash using camera."
5,Excellent quality for the money paid,"The screen top is a great buy considering its low cost.One of the sides is a lot stiffer to open than the other, but in a way this actually makes it even better since the stiffer side holds the top very tight in place and not wobbling at all when the other side is open (since most people would get some wobble due to the slight variations in tank sizes (I have seven 30 gallon tanks and none of them are exactly the same size, always a small deviation).They make the top slightly bigger to make sure they fit all size deviations so rest assured it will fir your tank.Very happy with this purchase."
5,This book is perfect for one parent families!,Our family is made up of just mom & baby. So run of the mill baby books just don't work. There are too many pages you can't fill out and who wants those pages left blank? I felt so fortunate when someone suggested this book to me. The beginning of the book has space for the parent to tell about his or her life and then it goes into the baby's story. I like the way it tells the story of parent and child better than a standard baby book.
4,THE BEST FROM THE BEST,THIS IS THE BEST COLLECTION OF THE SUPERFREAK HIMSELF. I WAS JUST A KID WHEN HE CAME OUT BUT NOW THAT I AM 20YRS. OLD I CAN'T HAVE A PARTY WITHOUT THE ULTIMATE COLLECTIONS
4,very helpful except a bit too thin,"My office has papers scattered all over. One of the problems of putting them in folders is that unless you get folers of several colors, it is impossible to differentiate one folder from another unless your close enough to read the little label. These ""Brights"" solves this problem. I can look at the files for a particular matter and pick out ""correspondence"" from, e.g., pleadings, or discovery (lawyer talk) very quickly. And having two fasteners in each folder is also very helpful.The problem with these folder is while there are two fasteners, the thickness of the cardboard is not strong enough to support the amount of paper one would like to put in a folder with two fasteners. There is no ""support"" when holding these files, and the risk of ripping because of the weight of the files limits their value.I'm glad I got these, but there not quite what i hoped for."
3,"Liked the organizational features, but not as sturdy as I'd like...","I really like the organizational features of these folders: the different colors, three different tab positions, and fasteners on both sides. I didn't rate it as highly as I could have due to the flimsy cardstock they used. They're okay for light files, but would be much more useful if heavier cardstock was used."
5,Helped my back and neck!,"This is a great alternative to yoga workout. So far I have only done the 20 minute workout, but I can really tell it speeds up my metabolism and has helped with my back and neck problems. I love the scripture that she uses during the poses. I think the one about your body being a temple is starting to sink in. I have never done yoga before and I would recommend this for other beginners. Great to find a workout that focuses your mind on God!!!"
4,Good alternative,"Some who do yoga tell me this is ""slow."" Well, that's OK, so am I! It's like any other Christian work-out video - scriptures, music, people to watch do it right, but it's yoga poses with Christian names (plus a few more original ones)."
3,good read,I got what I needed but this book would have been so much better with color pictures or at least clearer at some stages. I hated the lack of info about the heating and cooling system on the later models especially the 1303 model. I would have given up the last few chapters of outdated hot rod info for a diagram or picture of the blower fan and dash board layout and repair in the 1303 but no such luck.
5,Awesome literature based unit study!,"We have had so much fun with this! I have two types of learners that I use it with. My dd is an investigation nut! She looks up everything and records it in her many notebooks. This curriculum fits her like a glove! I also use it with my ds who has some language processing problems and has to be pushed to read anything or to try something new/learn something new. It fits him like a glove! How?! because the Beyond Five in a Row book has so much good information in it that I can read what's in it and decide what I want my children to investigate more deeply. Usually, my daughter looks up and reads books about 3 things compared to my son's one thing, but they both get the practice that they need. This unit study includes History, geography, science, Language Arts, discussion, research, vocabulary words, internet connections, art....and so much more. It foster's a love for learning!"
3,Arranging gone amok,"For some unknown reason, the editors and compilers of this hymnal thought it necessary to ""tamper"" with long-established wordings or musical arrangements. This rearranging of long-established tunes is especially troublesome to churches that have sung hymns in a particular way for generations. The addition of descant parts to so many hymns is often visibly confusing. This hymnal seems best suited to very large and musically sophisticated congregations who are open to innovations in their hymnody. Small and/or musically unsophisticated churches will find the book very confusing."
1,hearing is believing,customers lose faith in vendors when they deliver defective merchandise. The CD would not perform in any player used. Vendors must earn a customer's trust by supplying reliable quality in the first place or standing up with ready replacements when they don't. This vendor did neither.
4,Excellent album for their greatest hits.,"Anyone who likes the Tempts should have this album to at least hear Paul Williams sing, ""Don't Look Back."" Unfortunately, real Tempts lovers will miss greats like ""Beauty's Only Skin Deep"". Still, if you have to have only one Temptations album, this is as good as they come."
