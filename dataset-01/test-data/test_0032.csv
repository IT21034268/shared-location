1,Game,"game was scratched, but I was finally refunded my money--after I reminded the company. send return items guaranteed thru the post office--it's pays!"
4,"Great fun, many avenues to explore, Perfect for father and son. :)","Very well adapted and true to the first 3 movies' story lines. (A New Hope, Empire and Jedi; 1970's+'80's) Child-appropriate and comical depiction of good Vs. evil. There are lots of paths to explore, and could conceivably be an inexhaustible supply of entertainment. Just make sure their homework is done first!"
2,Disappointing,"Lovely book, lovely photos...BUT I am disappointed in the recipes. Admittedly, I have only tried five of them, but was disappointed in all five. I am a good cook,lived in Greece for 2 years, and have been cooking Greek food for some 30 years with great success. Some of the MEZE recipes were O.K., but not REALLY good, and one was a disaster. Sorry."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing, especially after reading the description and the glowing reviews posted here. I thought I would get a lot more tips on how to clean quickly and efficiently, but I only found one tip I felt would make a difference. I also thought the book would give a better plan of attack for cleaning the whole house, but the plan was scattered throughout the book. I would have liked to have seen that plan presented in a single place (perhaps as a review at the end of the book.)I also felt this book just scratched the surface of the hows and whys of cleaning and organizing. I think people would be much better served buying two separate books that go more in depth into both topics. I don't know which book to suggest for cleaning, but for organizing ""Organizing From The Inside Out"" by Julie Morganstern is the best."
1,Disappointed,"I wasn't sent the right book, very disappointed! I ordered the WORKTEXT not the teacher text! Now I have to reorder."
1,MC Hammer as a druglord? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!,"In a movie where Brian Bosworth (Blackout) goes on a vengence spree after the bad dudes who killed his wife and kid, sounds interesting doesnt it, but trust me, this action/thriller sucks bigtime. Too much of a bad thing and we get some pretty corny acting. Also, this is a movie people where Rapper MC Hammer (He is credited as Hammer) portrays a druglord...so you do a math. Bruce Payne (Dungeons and Dragons, Passenger 57) in full blown long hair tries to deliver us a calm and cool collective badguy but ends up delivering a really corny and annoying part. When doesnt Payne play a dipstick badguy? Jeff Kober (Demolition High, A Man Apart) also stars as one of Payne's lackies. The action is really weak and the acting is even weaker. Dont expect much for this constipated ride....rent something else."
5,FANTASIA -- Star for ALL America,"Fantasia is great! And I am so happy that they used the song of my other favorite Idol -- Tamyra Gray! They both have voices that satisfies ALL generations. Fantasia reminds me so much of two famous ""idols"", Diana Washington and Esther Phillips, whom I know a lot of younger people don't know anything about. To those who don't like this style, don't excuse it as bad...it's just something that you're not familiar with -- an American Idol should be able to sing something all America enjoys listening to...not all of them have done that."
3,Pretty good,"I loved Fantasia so much on the show american idol that i just had to have the cd. but the only song that was good was ""summertime"" she did a wonderful job with this song! ""chain of fools"" was a bad remake, the original was much better, ""I believe"" was a good song but not for Fantasia, diana did a much better job with this song. I still love her voice, and I hope that her next cd is better."
3,Not the best recording quality for a brilliant talent,"I bought this 3-song CD and plan to buy her album. Fantasia is a brilliant talent and her performances on American Idol thrilled me and my husband.However, I was disappointed in this CD -- the song I Believe is quite corny, and even Summertime seems to be a ""hurried up"" version of the stunning versions we heard on TV.What happened in the recording studio and how many managers stuck their fingers in this pie??Still, I plan to support her and will buy whatever she puts out next."
1,I think Simon summed it up perfectly:,"""Donald Duck on helium."" Grating to the ears, at best. Fantasia should audition for a spot in the musical Hairspray, where sreeching is celebrated."
1,Okay CD but not as good as I'd expected,I had heard so much hype about Fantasia that I expected her CD to be better than this. Contrary to reports she is not and never will be another Whitney Houston.
5,WHO IS THIS BritGirl,"FIST OFF YOU MUST DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO AMERICAN IDOL BECAUSE SIMON STATED IN THE BEGINNING THAT FANTASIA WAS THE BEST AND NEXT AMERICAN IDOL. AND WHAT RECORD DO YOU HAVE WHERE YOU CAN DOWN SOMEBODY ELSE. FANTASIA DID A GREAT JOB GOING OUT AFTER HER DREAMS, DANG IF YOU CAN SING OR DO HALF OF WHAT SHE DID PLEASE JUST HUSH."
1,Nasal Sounding,"Yikes just what we need another nasal sounding singer. Bad singer, bad cd, do not recommend unless you have ear plugs."
1,THIS CD PROVES AMERICAN IDOL NEEDS TO GO!!!,"Another Idol, more hype, bad songs, mediocre performances...enough is enough people! American Idol needs to be cancelled immediately.......unfortunately, this is what America wants.......I'm just waiting for the day when this show will be passe'. These kids are having their lives ruined by this show. This CD is just another example of why America is in the sad shape its in."
2,Worst production ever!,"American Idol has topped itself in reaching an alltime low. She can't sing great only a like a cartoon. She sets a poor example for single mothers who think they will become the next American Idol. If I'm generous, I'd say she is a pretty good singer, but not American Idol, or what I'd expect. Diana DeGarbage doesn't matter either. Everyone knows that Jennifer Hudson was the only hope we had and the stupid rigged show blew it for us!"
1,Both released singles were horrible..,"I think that this single is awful. The songs are so cheesy, and I've heard enough of Fantasia. Her voice makes me cringe at times, when she screeches through her higher notes. And the million ""yeah, yeah's"" are now unbearable to listen to. This really doesn't seem like ""music"" to me. I do like ""I Believe"" - but I like Diana's better. I think most people would realize how much better Diana's was if they had the rest of the song, like Fantasia got to have. Although Diana's single was terrible too... ""I Believe"" was a good song for Diana. It just fits her voice much better. I don't see good things for Fantasia in the future. I really don't think any of the American Idols will last, sad to say."
3,Pretty good on some songs...,"I watched American Idol and I really do like Fantasia Barrino and Diana Degarmo both. I really like Fantasia's Chain of Fools. She sings that really well, but I think that Diana definately surpasses Fantasia with ""I believe"" Diana was MADE for that song just as fantasia was MADE for Chain of Fools."
1,"Album sucks, as expected!","Well, what do we really expect from a non-singer who tries to shriek through each song with her squeaky voice?No wonder this is a flop by AI standards!"
1,"Horrible, just horrible!","I do not know why people would listen to this horrible sounding stuff, it certainly isn't singing! She has the worst voice I have ever heard. This was definitely a waste of my money, not one of the three songs on here are any good. She needs some professional lessons before she records again!"
3,Dramatic and talented,"After listening to Fantasia's new cd, I think she is a very talented young woman. She gets a little pitchy sometimes, but I think with practice and a voice coach, she will be a star! She is still young with a dramatic touch!. She tries just a little too hard."
5,Soul touching,I have loved her voice ever since I heard her version of Summertime on American Idol. I can not listen to the CD without shedding a tear. Her voice goes right to my heart.
1,The worst singer in the world!,"The girl can't sing! All she does is squeak, squeak, squeak. She shrieks her way through all the boring, ugly songs. She's the most overrated non-talented singer in the world. Don't waste your money on this poor CD."
1,American GARBAGE!!!,"Thankfully, I didn't buy this CD. I was in my friends car and she played it for me. She said, you have to hear this garbage. I can't believe I wasted a good $5.00 on this. I had to agree with her. It was beyond awful. Fantasia has a very annoying voice that grates on you. While listening to her music, I actually found myself covering my ears when she would screech. And what is with the Ya Ya Ya's that she adds to everything she sings. I'm was never a fan of the Ameican Idol show and to be honest, after hearing this CD, I can assure you, I won't be wasting my time every watching that show. If this is the best in America that that show could come up....How sad for this country!!!"
1,No No No No!!,She may have a big mouth but she sure as hell don't make up for it in singing! Too much yeah yeah yeah's gives her a no no no no! for her debut. Sorry Fantasia! Not a fan of yours!
5,"WOW Fantasia Creates Magic with ""I Believe""","This CD is amazing. You get a bonus verse or as I like to call it a ""surprise"" verse in ""I believe"". It is sooooo beautiful. Summertime is simply FABULOUS. GET IT, you'll LOVE IT."
1,1 star is the best compliment she's ever got,Why can't I give this a -10 this CD is complete trash.After work I decided to get this CD I want to see what this years American idol sounds like.Ouch Wasn't there anybody better then this.I want my money back this is a disgrace to humanity
1,This CD is a screamer!,"What a horrible, HORRIBLE CD this is! My friend (if I can call him that) gave me this CD. All Fantasia does is scream, screetch and yell all the words of what used to be great songs! And people are right, the Yeah, yeah, yeah's s*uck! How did we end up with these two losers near the top? What happened to Latoya! Come on, this is a joke! I threw the CD out the window and I accidently hit some weeds with it and they got knocked down. It did save me from some gardning work so I gave it 1 star."
1,Ear Plugs,"I am not a big AI fan, and neither of the AI 3 finalists are that great either. Listening to Fantasia screech her vocals makes me want to grap ear plugs. She sounds just as bad as Macy Gray. Both have no talent and have horrible voices. On the other side we have Diana. She also has a lot of work to do on her vocals. She is to nasal and is hard to listen to. Given a choice between the two, I would have to go with Diana, who has a softer calmer voice. And I dont feel the need to reach for the ear plugs. Diana is to nasal, and Fantasia sounds like a cat about to die schreeching! Kids today have little to no talent, can not write or play their own music. Some can not even sing their own music. These kids need to graduate first before singing."
5,Fantasia is the Best Idol Ever,"This was by far the best cd/single I've heard from anyone in a while. Everyone should buy it. Amazon, you should be more selective in what you allow in your reviews, to dislike an artist's music is one thing, but to write infantile, insulting comments is disgusting and inappropriate. Everyone knows that the writers of these horrible reviews did not buy the cd nor did they listen to it; but this is the internet and apparently anything goes. This young woman has the favor of God and will do well in her career. Fantasia continue to ask God to close your eyes and ears to the negativity, and keep in mind, that you are the absolute bomb, your true fans adore you. My rating is a 5 of 5, she is FANTASTIC."
4,Fantasia is okay.,"I was not a big fan of Fantasia on AI3, because I preferred Latoya London more. However, I will concede the fact that Fantasia definitely has stage presence. I just do not prefer the sound of her voice, as I find it to be ""squeaky.""I will give her 4 stars though because I think she is still talented regardless of my opinion."
3,Nice Song,"I have both CD's Diana and Fantasia, my thought..both are good but I like Diana's better..Diana's voice is more powerful and sweet to listen too.Different styles, but both girls will really go far..best of luck to both of you..and for those who keep on bashing these girls..I think you're all need to grow up! It takes a lot of hard work, extra efford days after days nights after nights to be on AI, they work very hard for what they believe in and to be where they are today, we should be proud for both of them. Each of us have our own preferences nothing wrong with that..but it's really wrong to bashed them with all of your unkind words...so give it up and enjoy the music."
1,Sorry - Not Very Good,"I never cared for the sound of Fantasia's voice, but I really enjoyed her stage presence. She is wonderful to watch. I expected great things from this CD, but was let down. The ""yeah, yeah, yeah's"" really throw off the song. I find myself listening more for those (and counting them) rather than listening to the songs. Much too much schreeching and yeahing for me. I hoped for more, but it didn't deliver."
5,Fantasia--Your new rating is all of the stars in the sky,"Dear Fantasia:You've done it! You've made your dreams come true even after many adversities.Keep that upbeat, I can do anything spirit. Surround yourself with good people, and don't forget to pray.God is the only judge you have to please so continue to enjoy yourself and entertain your audiences. Be true to yourself.There will be some who just don't ""get you."" Don't worry, because a new fan is being born every minute. America enjoys all types of music; because remember this, they voted for you!Stay encouraged, and don't look back.Your real fans love you and your CD. We cannot wait for your new album. We know it will be great.Keep smiling!"
1,Perfect word:,"Terrible. I just got the single, and sent it back right after listening to it, dont buy the single."
2,Let the Yelling Begin,Her singing is way over the top. Sounds like she is yelling every song.Not recommended if you want to keep your eardrums intact.
5,"great cd, igg the haters","I knew that people where gonna be waiting to diss Fantasia, doing the best they can to bring her down by putting one stars here when they probably didn't even listen to her cd. But its okay because she proves three times on this CD why she is the American idol. She said she is prayer for God to close her eyes to the negativity and open her eyes to the positive, and doing just that is what's gonna make her the star she was born to be.We have a gift in this beautiful, talented young woman."
4,"As lawys, great!","By whatever name she goes, Amanda Quick is always great. This is a great series and worth reading."
4,Love this author,"Jayne Ann Krentz strikes again under her historical romance pseudonym, Amanda Quick. Her heroine, as usual, is spicy and daring. Her hero, as usual, is strong and not a little mysterious. Why mess with a proven formula."
2,I'll never know what the river knows.,"I wish that writers would not call their books Romance novels if they are going to leave out the romance. The hero and heroine in this book have all the romantic excitement of Ozzie and Harriet. The interesting thing is, I liked them both, but Amanda simply did not make them the least bit romantically appealing. I don't mind enduring repetitive plots in her stories because some of her secondary characters are absolutely great, and in this story, some of them were more exciting than the leading couple. In fact, I don't even remember the lady's name. I think the hero's name was Anthony. If you're happy with a story in which the leading lady could easily have been a young and gabby, prim and proper Agatha Christie, then maybe you'll like this book. But if you're expecting romance, find yourself something else to read. That's what I had to do because I couldn't finish this one."
4,"""Completely Underrated""","Volcano is a completely underrated film with great special effects along with good acting and a so-so storyline. Give this movie a definate chance, you will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish!"
4,"A fun, but mindless movie","This is fun, but predictable and unbelievable star vehicle for Tommy Lee Jones.I recommend this movies for those times you want something enjoyable to just ""veg out"" for the evening.The movie moves fast enough with Tommy Lee Jones' acting to keep you entertained.Just watch and don't think."
1,I think I lost some IQ...,This has to be one of the dumbest movies...ever...Yes ever...Seeing this movie I think my IQ dropped 20 points from it's stupid storyline and totally impossible happenings as a volcano magically forming in LAReally dumb....the only thing good about this movie is laughing at it the entire way for its sheer stupidity
2,Towering Turkey,"Volcano,released in 1997,was a huge box-office flop,and deservingly so.It was boring,dull,moronic,illogicial,predictable,and the special effects were... cheesy.Not even Tommy Lee Jones could save it.The two stars is only for the cute daugter."
3,Poor Release of Volcano Movie,"Overall, I thought the movie was stupid and a waist of time. I though the movie did not have much plot to it and felt it could have been much better. I did like the special effects that were used. Tommy Lee Jones was a good actor and played his part. I would wait to rent it and not own it as my own copy."
3,"Good, Mindless Entertainment","I rented this movie and ""Titanic"" from the library on the same weekend (our library doesn't charge for videos, so the price is right). It was just as enjoyable on the tv screen as in the theatre, which is to say it is entertaining as long as you don't question how silly it all is. I love watching L.A. get destroyed, though (I live there). And casting Tommy Lee Jones in the main role was a good idea. It was good fun - so was the Titanic, except one won an Oscar and the other didn't. Go figure."
4,great phone,"This phone works really well - I have had no problems. One of the reviews above states that the phone cannot be used to answer calls picked up 1st by another phone or vice versa. This is not true. Hold the button a little longer to answer on a ""line in use"". Just a feature to keep you from jumping in on someone accidentally.Have no fear - buy it."
2,"An OK phone... but, be aware....","The short and the sweet.The NiCad battery is indeed a problem, expect to replace it after 6 months, as the handset will only run for 40 or so minutes then... Say, (...) at (...) for a new battery.The speaker phone function is fine, but not for business use. Friends, family, yes.At the price, an OK deal. But not a steal.Beware of 900 Mhz interference, this phone killed (via interference) my GE 900 Mhz headset phone, so if you wish (or have) another 900 Mhz phone at home, you should be carefull."
3,Headset compatibility problem,"This is a GREAT phone, unless you want to use the headset. You must use a headset with a Mic that goes directly in front of your mouth. More modern 2.5mm headsets such as the Plantronics M145 or M135 will not work. People on the other end will not be able to hear you well. If you do not want to use the headset, this is one of the best values in 2-line phones."
5,"""Would you rather"" twisted, sick and gross","""WYR, twisted, sick and gross"" is funny, often the kids got in the action as well because they LOVE gross things - and tried to gross-out the adults"
3,Well....?,"Some questions were sick, twisted and I don't know what group of people could answer them. Others were hilarious and still others were morally tough to answer. A great game after several Jell-O shots. Be very cautious with your audience, ie. no kids allowed!!!!"
4,Just the cards are worth it!,"My husband and I bought this for some friends and ended up opening it and staying up for hours just reading the cards to eachother. Some are sick and twisted and some are gross but some can start really indepth conversations. Then some just make you laugh till you cry. They are divided into catergories such as eating, pain, embarassment, and ethics. We haven't actually played the game with the rules but just the cards are worth it."
2,Where's Jessica?,"25-year old Jessica Simpson delievers her latest ""A Public Affair"", which shows no effort. Jessica has a good voice, but it seems like she didnt really care what she was doing with this album. Could it be the divorce?, I dont know. But this album does contain a good song or two; like her new single ""I Belong To Me"", or her remake of ""You Spin Me Round (Like A Record). I really dont think it's a good purchase, but hey who I am to tell so?....."
1,Can't hardly hear her - VERY bad mix,"I'm ticked. I don't buy many CD's (usually download specific songs). I liked her Irresistable CD, but this is aweful. One song is good, the rest sound like mush.The worst thing is that you can't hardly hear her sing. The mix is terrible, the vocals are way too low compared to the volume of her voice. It sounded like she whispered through most of the songs (I play this on a very high end system).DO NOT buy this piece of junk. I want my money back but I already opened the CD."
1,Disappointed Jess Fan,"I have been waiting for this cd anxiously, and was quite disappointed. Really weak lyrics to the point of annoying. I did like the Spin me like a record song. Also, the transitions between songs just don't work for me."
2,Disappointed,"I like Jessica's previous album, but this one is pretty bad. I am surprised because I really like A Public Affair, but most of the other songs are not good. She has a few that are decent, but most seem more like a newbie album, not her 3 or 4th album."
1,"""And the Band Played On"" should be pulled from the shelves...","This is a horrible CD; most of the songs are extremely cliche and breathily sang. It seems that Jessica Simpson just can't evolve and grow as an artist. Instead, she's stuck in the mold of producers telling her what to do to get sales. It's rare to find a real talent in the music industry that is not a fabrication (Christina Aguilera), and Jessica Simpson certianly is not one of those. In my option, her music career should be over as of now."
2,Let Him Fly?,"If you want to here a great version of the song""Let Him Fly"", try the version from the Dixie Chicks ""Fly"" cd or the one from the writer, Patty Griffin,on her ""Living with Ghosts"" cd.I think Jessica has a good voice but her version pales in comparison to the other 2."
5,Great!,"I've been listening to Jessica's new album for about a week and it's really good. I've put 11 out of the 14 songs on my IPod. I wasn't going to buy this album because I hate the single ""A Public Affair"" but I saw it on the shelf at Wal-Mart for less than ten bucks, so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. The rest of the CD makes up for the title track! I still like In This Skin better, but I like listening to this type of music too."
1,What happened?,This album is a BIG disappointment!!!! This is nothing like her old stuff! I definitely would reconsider purchasing this album because it is not worth the money!
1,hate to be honest...,"especially when there's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful. the songs are so cheesy, her voice is out of place in half the songs. it's whiny, irritating, dull and at this point, I'm not sure who's more talented, her or her sister. they got the looks, sure, but there's lots of pretty girls in this world, doesn't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd. & that's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album. & I'm sorry Jes, but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR $$$,"I am actually a fan of Jessica...I think she is generally fun to watch and has a good voice(sometimes). But this record is just sub-par. The songs are really dumb with stupid lyrics and no feeling. Her voice sounds just plain weird half of the time. One of the worst albums of the year, for sure. While I hate to make this comparison- I actually bought Nick Lachey's CD a while back and I am still listening to it all day. THAT is one great CD."
1,get rid of this tired freak,another crappy cd coming from miss simpson oh yeah she goes motown here this is why people download music because of crap like this screw her and her punk ex hubby and slutty sis ashley and oh yeah she can't even keep a damn boyfriend the dunce.
1,"Don't bother attending this ""affair""","Jessica Simpson's albums consistently get bad reviews, but no matter. I have enjoyed every single one. Until now, that is.A lot has happened to Simpson since she recorded her last disc. She has made the transition from B-lister to superstar. So, naturally I had high hopes for this album. Songwriters and producers would take notice and finally give her some songs that would launch her singing career into the stratosphere, I thought. Unfortunately, I thought wrong.The album begins with her so-so first single, ""A Public Affair"", and pretty much goes downhill from there. The disc's only redeeming track is ""The Lover in Me"", which is worth more than the $.99 it costs to download. But aside from this one bright spot, these songs make for an extremely disappointing affair."
1,It's Time For Jessica To Go!,"Out of all the natural and bleached blondes in the United States who can really sing, Jessica Simpson had to be the lucky one. I can't even believe she even made it this far. Her voice lacks depth, range, and maturity, basically, she sounds awful. Not as bad as Shakira, but close. Anyway, ""A Public Affair"" is a complete mess and should've been kept private. Jessica doesn't even know what she wants to do: pop, country, R&B, or swing, so she decides to do it all. I mean, did she even listen to this album before she released it? Embarrassing!"
3,Eh. Listen before you buy!,"I am a Jessica Simpson fan, just from her show, and select singles...well, I was pleased with ""A Public Affair"" and couldn't wait to see what her new cd had...It is not that this is a bad cd...it just sounds like someone told her to do this style on this song, this style on that song etc. There is not really a flow to the cd. It is part dance, part country-esque (on ""Push Your Tush"" which obviously is capitalizing on ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"" type sound..ballad, etc..Some of the songs are good, like ""A Public Affair"" and my favorite on the album ""If You Were Mine""... ""Push Your Tush"" is cute...and IMO this album is her best so far..In summary, I just think that it is a mish-mosh of songs, some good, some...not so good and some in the middle. I don't think this cd will be a favorite of mine, but it won't be in the trash either..listen first before plunking down your money!"
2,"Next, Please","I agree with the majority of posts. I am dissapointed in Jessica's new album and I own all of her albums. Why does she have to sing all ""breathy""? What happened to the ""belt-out-I Wanna Love You Forever"" Jessica? She lost a lot of fans when she didn't want to split her earnings 50:50 with Nick. She wouldn't even be popular today if she hadn't gotten married and been on a tv show. Next time, I think she should try an edgier sound, kinda like Kelly Clarkson or her sister, Ashlee. Jessica can sing. I just don't know why she tries to do the sexy whisper on all her songs anymore! And I think the song ""Walkin Round"" sounds like it is from a Stevie Nicks song. Why so many samples?"
1,Could be better,I was hopping for a good album but instead its very average. At first it seemed boring but now I got used to it and its ok.I think instead of beeing all over she should have picked on styly of music plus to me the way songs put together is not a good choiceI hope she comes out with some better material soon
1,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this CD, she seemes to have lost her edge. Maybe losing at love made her lose her ability to produce good music. Her ex-husbands CD in my opinion is the better buy, and has alot better sound and spirit then hers."
4,Dog's eye view of the world,"I just had to respond to the reader who panned this book: do you own a dog? This is a VERY funny book! And well done. Murphy, like many dogs and their humans had gotten into the habit of too many calories and too little exercise. To view the storyline as a case of ""society's...reverence of appearance above all else"" and to equate Cheryl's conduct with ""humilia[ion] by forced exercise or dieting"" is a major case of the reader projecting HER issues on Murphy! He's a dog: he lives to eat, sleep AND please his alpha dog, Cheryl. And Cheryl, like any good alpha dog (or parent, for that matter) is using positive discipline and proactive behavior to mold her protege into the best--and healthiest--dog he can be.My kids love this book! And they don't see the negative messages that the CA reader does; they see a funny story about an owner's creative way to help her dog get healthier."
4,A new twist on sci-fi,"Enemy Mine is a great depiction of what we would do when confronted with our greatest fear/hate/loathing and forced to deal with or die.Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr. are fantastic in this film! Quaid as the human astronaut is great, and gives a real sense of his loathing for the Drac species. His character's growth and change in attitude is very well done and a believable performance. Gossett is also remarkable as the Drac, and his portrayal of an asexual creature so different (and yet similar) to us is nothing short of extraordinary. He also grows, learning to love the human Quaid as a friend/brother and giving him the ultimate gift: his child.The special effects may not be Academy-material, but they do the job well for this film. While this is science fiction, the story is what makes this film so great. I don't know if it would work in any other setting/genre, but it certainly works here. If you haven't seen this, watch it!"
4,Great movie depicting discrimination and slavery,"At its heart Enemy Mine is a movie describing slavery and war. It describes how we see those who look different as someone we cannot get along with. This is one of those movies I saw years ago and fell in love with. Over time it continues to come to mind in different ways, with the hut the human built (and quickly fell down), the interactions between the Drak and the Humans as well as the violence taking place by slave masters against the slaves.While the special effects aren't going to win any awards, they were very good for their time. The acting is good, and the story is very engaging. Definitely worth picking up, though probably when you can get it on sale."
2,Twelfth Night a Disappointment,I tried this because Kenneth Branaugh's name was connected and I find his Shakespeare enjoyable and extremely useful in the classroom. Avoid this. It is BORING. I'll stick with the Trevor Nunn production which is appreciated by my students the way Shakespeare should be appreciated. The only plus to this version it is set on one stage.
4,MUST read before entering adulthood,"I think this was a book that all soon-to-be adults or new adults should read, from right after college to age 30. It explores many of the things that were never thought of after college: Am I doing the right thing? Why am I so unhappy? Why am I so lonely? Why is finding friends so hard? What about ""the one""?It really gave me a lot of advice, but what's more it made me think of ideas myself. All the tips are just that -- tips to lead you to your own thinking, your own strategy.I hope I can get all my college friends to read this book, that's how good it is."
5,"Fun, Quick Read With Many Great Tips","Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis is a MUCH better book than its predecessor. I was psyched to find a book that I could read quickly and glean reams of terrific tips for surviving my 20s. The ""mentor"" 20somethings and 30somethings in this book are down-to-earth and relatable, and their and Ms Robbins' words of advice are the best advice I've heard for this age group."
5,fantastic!,"My 4 year old grandson has been watching these John Deere videos since he was 1 and has not grown tired of them. If you have a little boy that likes tractors, you can be certain this will be entertaining to him!"
5,LAND OF OPPORTUNITY - E*I*E*I*O,"""This smashing debut recording by the one of the worst-named bands in Wisconsin history (if not all of rock & roll) is economical at ten songs, but there are no clunkers on board. E-I-E-I-O's LAND OF OPPORTUNITY takes its inspiration from rockabilly and roots rock, but is not confined by the stifling mannerisms of those genres. Vocalist/songwriter Steve Summers' rich melodic voice often comes close to a country-esque yelp, but never gives in to stereotypical nostalgia, even with nearly all of the songs' subject matter somehow relating to travel. Guitarists Rob Harding (formerly of OFF BROADWAY) and Mike Hoffman are razor sharp, especially on the breakneck ""Go West Young Man."" Summers and the band's other songwriter, bassist Richard Szeluga, rarely co-wrote songs, and their individual tastes keep the album's perspective interesting and fresh. This CD release added two songs from the ""Go West Young Man"" 12-inch single."""
5,Just started,"I am taking two bottles right now, epicot and allermax. My intake of allegra decreased after i started taking this too. I don't think it work as fast as allegra, i wanted something more natural. Works for sinuses!"
3,not much of a guitar instructional video,"I bought this combo pack several years ago and was disappointed. I was expecting a full on guitar instructional video like the former REH ""Power Lines"", but this ""Definitive"" video is more performances and information about his equipment/sound set-up than guitar instruction."
1,Speed 2 - Cruise Control,"Definately Avoidable. Sheer waste of time. The acting is very average and the storyline is very weak. Even Sandra Bullock has given an ordinary performance.If you want to waste money, then rent it."
1,booooring,What a waste of time and money. This was probably the stupidest Sandra Bullock movie ever made...not that her movies aren't stupid enough already. And you wonder why Keanu Reeves wouldn't do this movie.
1,Speed 2 -Cruise Control,"Definitely avoidable. Sheer waste of time. The acting is very average and tze storytelling is very weak. Even Sandra Bullock has given an oridinary performance.If you want waste money, then rent it."
3,none,i think the action is this movie is pretty good but this movie would have been better if the carector jack form the first speed movie movie was is it and if dennis hopper was in this movie playing the villian from the first speed movie's twin brother out for revenge.
2,Full of Tips on How to Draw Poorly,"This book is substantive and comprehensive. Many techniques and exercises for building up skill are laid out and integrated into useful units that can be worked on in series or independently. However, the art style of Borgman is more like 1960's/1970's pamphlet and encyclopedia art. The pen work is loose and imprecise and the pencil work is quite sloppy.I ordered this book because I wanted to learn to be a technical and precise illustrator, but the sloppiness and outdated art style contained in this book do not help me much.I will have to send it back."
2,Not exactly the Godfather,"This is a violence-prone, pretentious, and often confusing film that is neither interesting nor entertaining. Mobsters ""whacking"" each other, apparently without reason--just to show themselves tough and heartless. One expects much more, like a coherent plot, from the Coen brothers. Fine acting, dreadful script, horrid film."
3,Not sure what the point was,"It's the 1920s in a big, corrupt city controlled by gangsters. Violence, stupidity, backstabbing and greed are everywhere. There are beatings, shootings, burnings, and broken glass. It's always dark, even during the day. Anyone who doesn't end up dead ends up unhappy."
3,Ambiguous Gangsters of Coen Bros.,"I saw the film when it was first released. What stayed in my recollection is the Irish music, fine cinematography, brutal violence and some very inventive set pieces. This blu ray disc reproduced some of the beautiful scenes e.g. in the forest but failed to tone down the makeup which made all men wore red lipsticks. 22 years on, the film now looks a bit flashy with a hollow center. It is mainly due to the lacking of deeper explorations or descriptions of the 3 main charactors, the 2 gangsters and Gabriel Byrne's charactor, critically the latter. How good a right hand man was he? Why was he so like by his boss, even after he betrayed him? Was he really heartless or souless? Are they simply small time hoods? It is all very ambiguous. For these reasons, it is not a fully satisfying period crime film."
3,Nice try,"This is not a bad movie, but The Godfather was made a while ago. You can't improve on genius. Also, there's something about British actors trying to speak in an American accent that doesn't quite work. Albert Finney is a terrific actor but doesn't quite work here. You can see the Coen Brothers honing their skills, though. It's worth watching for that alone."
5,Brilliant!,"This is one of my favourite movies. Like other reviewers, I have been keenly awaiting this DVD release. This powerful gangster movie is brilliantly filmed and acted with Gabriel Byrne and John Turturro putting in the performances of their respective careers. The movie builds suspense and contains snappy dialogue and great one-liners. Enjoy!"
3,Don't do it!!,"The exercise books for the Steck-Vaughn series are just plainly not worth it. They are slim books, and the questions do not correlate with the study books. I would suggest just finding a GED mentor to help you study before the big test."
5,A must have for the Christian video library,"This is probably the best of all the Story Keepers videos. While there are many fine easter videos, few show the last days of Jesus as honestly and yet ""child friendly"". My five year old loves the video and watches it year 'round."
1,An assault on nature,"I know virtually nothing about Sarah Brightman and have only heard one track on this record. That listening has left me so apopletic, however, that I am moved to submit this rant. Why-oh-why did Brightman feel the need to cover Naturaleza Muerta by Spanish pop genuises Mecano. Singing over a nearly identical arrangment to the original, she attempts to give the song an identical reading. Since she's not apparantly fluent in Spanish, her ham-handed (tongued?) pronunciation wreaks havoc with this fragily beautiful melody. For heaven's sakes, if you're going to cover something, and you aren't constrained by the requirements of pleasing a Vegas lounge audience, do something with it -- interpret it."
1,"If you like Muzak, you'll love this CD! Yuck!","Do you like boring interpretations of boring songs? Do you find yourself loving music that makes you sleepy? Like Charlotte Church? Do you want to say you ""like opera"", but not want to listen to an actual opera? This awful CD should do the trick. If you like it, that's great. Then take it one step further and go to the opera! Buy a CD by an actual opera singer! Popera is not opera. Popera is just muzak that deludes you into thinking it's classical music. This is no more opera than Kenny G is jazz."
2,first track is really good,"If you are an opera snob, you might find the CD is a bit kitschy and some of her 'stylizing' a bit grating."
2,Sweet like a white zinfandel,"I think I finally know what bothers me about Sarah Brightman, and this album. Although her voice is pure and sweet, it reminds me of my indoctrination into the world of wine.... When I first tasted a white zinfandel, I found the flavor pure and sweet. But as my tastes became more complicated, I found it to be...... goopy and sweet. Hmmmm. Sounds like a vocalist I know of."
1,Ugh.,"Puke. This CD is just another awful example of the ""Opera Lite"" craze. I thought Phantom was bad, but this is worse. Programming that makes no sense, that austere, white sound, boring muzak interpretations. And Bocelli's not helping anything. I will exempt Jose Cura's performance from my wrath, but the whole thing is not worth using as a coaster; you'd be better off buying a CD by one of the many talented opera singers on the market. Just my two cents."
4,You can always count on your friends!,This is a movie about true friendship and courage. Madeline is one my child's favorite characters and enjoys watching the action packed and clever story of our heroine's adventure in Paris.
1,A Book,"Besty is a girl that is different, she meets Joe falls in love, leaves, and then attends school. Really boring even though It sounds pretty true. If you decide to read this book have a bucket nearby and a pillow incase you barf, or get so bored you fall over asleep! But if you still want to read it don't say I didn't warn you!"
2,DISAPPOINMENT,"I read this as an assignment from our San Francisco Mechanics Institute Book Club. Hersey worked for Sinclair Lewis and his mentor's style is obvious. It is done in the same rather superficial narrative style.as Lewis' works. Admittedly, I like a novel with psychological, spiritual and symbolic aspects. A Bell for Adano does have the the overly obvious symbolism of the connection to our Liberty Bell. Basically this is a propaganda piece for W.W.II. It did have over 20 printings in a short period of time which brings to mind the expression that no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American and, in this case, also British people. Despite its triteness and thin literary veneer it is an easy read suitable for an airplane ride and a 9th grade English class."
3,A fun book for an airplane ride,"which is when I read it between Toronto and Rome. This is a fun, slight book which gives a few unique insights into Italy, the war and the U.S. Army. I kind of wished it was more hard hitting but the author was writing in the 40s a more innocent, less critical time."
2,Lisa from Michigan,"After reading the Passion and the Promist(two excellent books), this book dissapointed me. It was slow and I never had any emotional ties to the charectors."
5,Looks great,"Bought this book for my sister, I think she loves it. You guys need to ask about it before buying cause I didn't read a word of it. But anyway it was delivered fast, and protected well, the book looks great from outside. And by the author I assume that it is great from inside as well."
3,Somewhat Dull,"I think Destiny's Child is a good group. However, some of the tracks on their CD were hard to listen to because the song's tempo was to slow and dull. I did enjoy the Part 1 and Part 2 of their songs, With Me and No, No, No. I think if they work a little more on the beat to their songs, then they could maybe be as popular as TLC was."
1,really lame,"this is the problem with current R-N-B all recycled music.these Young Lady's have some talent but this run of the mill writting&music weighs whatever they may have down badly.since they come out with songs that repeat the subject three times please don't become Puppets, puppets, puppets."
3,100 pages too long,"While thought provoking, McKibben would have served his readers better by some judicious self-editing. His ideas get lost in examples and counter examples. Transitions between chapters are weak, as though he made a book of several, seperate essays."
2,Good cast - interesting premise - falls flat,A good cast and an interesting premise should make for a good movie - not quite in this case. Somehow all the parts just don't quite come together and the end result is a long tedious movie. I think this film ran longer than the glam fad of the 70's did!
3,Velvet Goldmine,"This view is intriguing and if you're a rock fan of those who pushed the limits in the early days of hard rock, you'll like this film. Fine actors, but somewhat obtuse. I just took me longer than it should have to put all of the pieces together. Worth seeing if you like Christian Bale, Ewan McGregor, and the other find actors in their early years."
5,G L A M O U R,"I was never into glam rock and really never followed that type of music, mainly cause am a product of the eighties nor was I a Bowie fan nor of the Roxy Music scene etc. but this movie is a gem , its story and sexuality captivated me from start to finish especially the music, very flam, and glam. THis is a big city movie I dont think someone from the mid west would appreciate this but you never know. Open Mindness Needed."
5,MUST be played at MAXIMUM volume,"He's done it again! If Todd Haynes never did anything else in his life, he can feel VERY satisfied with his work on ""Velvet Goldmine"".As the film states in the opening sequence, it MUST be played at MAXIMUM volume. Once the music begins, it's impossible to stop.In today's cinema, films like ""Velvet Goldmine"" are few and hard to come by. Todd Haynes and his crew are wonderfully concerned with the aesthetic elements, i.e. photography, costumes.If nothing else, the film is worth watching just for Ewan McGregor's crazed, sometime nude performance of ""TV Eye"". What an amazing actor!Finally...after you have seen ""Velvet Goldmine"", buy the soundtrack and play it at maximum volume. You won't be sorry!"
5,Fantastic! Iggy Pop fans must see this film!,"Ewan McGregor is Iggy Pop. His american accent is correct, he flashes the ""down and out Iggy trashy junkie look"". He is great at playing Iggy Pop on stage. Iggy licensed his music to the film and I wish Bowie had too. If you want to buy into Bowie's future royalties (stock or bond issue), this film would have helped increase his music royalties income. A must for Iggy fans."
1,"""Electrifying""? When? How?","I found it the most boring film ever. I wonder if the one who said that this is an 'electrifying' movie, has ever seen a scene from it. The only thing worthwhile in it is the wardrobe, which had a deserved Oscar nomination."
5,Not a movie; an Experience!,"Wow is all I have to say. Todd Haynes has created an incredible visual and musical trip through 1970's glam rock and its aftermath. It is impossible not to get sucked in by this movie!Ewan McGregor is absolutely awesome asa Curt Wild, the, well, wild American rocker. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is absolutely creepy as Brian Slade, the Bowie-esque pop idol. Toni Collete as Mandy wows you through the changes she makes from beginning to end. And Christian Bale is astounding as Arthur, the ""Journalist from the Herald"" who embarks on the mission to discover whatever happened to Brian Slade.All I can really say is wow. Again. This movie will shock you, make you cry, make you laugh, make you wonder, change you forever. It will ""mangle your mind"". And the thing to remember is that ""Meaning is not in things but between them."""
5,Read VHS reviews on Amazon.com,"This was last years most important film to me. It's a multi-layered piece about identity, which touched on several hard hitting points. A visual treat, as well as sonically, I found no faults with this film. The reviews for the VHS copy on Amazon.com are a little more appropriate in my opinion."
5,Dazzling!,"Velvet Goldmine, the movie loosely based on the life of Glam Rock God, David Bowie, is a wonderful portrayal of the entire glam rock era. The story follows reporter Arthur Stuart(Christian Bale) in a search for the singer Brian Slade(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who had faked his own death years before. As the life of Brian Slade is revealed, the viewer is taken to the world of glam rock's finest days in London. Curt Wild(Ewan McGregor) is an American singer that infactuates, and eventually brings down Slade. To give away any more would be to spoil the film, so let me just say that this is one of the best movies i've ever seen and I very highly reccomend it!"
5,An Excellent peice of Glam History,"From the first time I saw this film I became an instant fan of the whole glam rock scene. It was a great and very brave flick, I enjoyed every minute of it. The storyline is very interesting, the casting is superb(esp Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Christian Bale and Ewan McGregor), I have the soundtrack and it is worth every penny. I'm only young and I didn't live in the seventies but to all of you who did I'm so jelous as this film has brought the decade to life. BUY THE VID AND SOUNTRACK IT'S WORTH IT!"
4,Glam - The Whole Strange Story,"This picture of the world of British Glam Rock displays one of the best movie soundtracks around. From the outfits to the strange story-line that you figure out in the end, the movie takes you on a whirlwind of thoughts, dreams, ideals, and even truths about Glam; the music that was made and the people that made it. Toni Collette to Ewan McGregor--Christian Bale to the lovely Johnathan Rhys Meyers, you see them acting at their best before Muriel, Obi Wan, American Psyco, and the Governess. I was impressed by the costuming and the extremity that the director went to to describe the occurances, rumors, and misfortunes of the Glam Rock era. Rent it, buy it, and purchase the CD too. If you enjoyed Boogie Nights, you will enjoy this. It gives deep insight to what that period in music history really was and how it affected its audience."
5,Thrift Books Rocks!,Thrift books packaged their book well and it was received on time. Great people to deal with.
5,Great series.,Great book. My fourth reading of this series. I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in the 1800's Royal Navy.
3,Good Help but can do about the same online,Originally I Thought it was going to really tough to switch over my name after the wedding but this book did help a little. The only thing is you can just about find all this information online now too. It does have forms you need in the back but not many of them. I also got a used (like-new) one and when i got it. I was disappointed to see it had been written in and some of the forms torn out. It's good to have but I found it isn't all that complicated once you know what you need to change.
5,Wonderful,This is Jeff at his best....and so what if a few of these tracks are available on other discs?! Listening to the version of 'Mojo Pin' on the Last Goodby disc will put to rest any questions of whether or not its 'worth it' to buy this.
4,"An updated, serious Monkeywrench Gang","I bought the book the day it showed up at the store. Fantastically well researched on the technical side. (nearly a Clancy novel in it's technical detail) The novelist is obviously still new at his craft as some of the writing seems a bit strained, but the story and plot are exceptionally well thought out as well as supported by all the technical detail. I not only will read it again, I've already passed it on to several friends with a strong recommendation to read it. Glen Canyon deserves to be brought back to life and Lake Foul drained... hopefully by non-nuclear means... Read it."
2,Rough Blu-Ray Transfer,"I don't have a lot to add to other recent reviews. Great movie, weak transfer. Detail is weak, colors are murky, and this looks like it was sourced from an old, worn out print. I have a hard time thinking that this film couldn't look better, based on the fact that Martin Scorsese directed it, and the director of photography obviously cared about their role...based on the amazing jib/crane shots alone. I just hope that a better print exists somewhere, and will make it to Blu-Ray someday.On the bright side, there appears to be little DNR, and the image is free from other signs of age, such as scratches, etc.For as much as I was impressed by the blu-ray of ""Raising Arizona"" (a film of similar vintage), I am equally dismayed by this transfer."
4,1080p HD,"Looks a lot better that the DVD version but does not seem to be 1080p clarity. Looks more of a 720p version. All in all for the price it was a great deal to get this version and put the dvd version on shelf. This is one of my favorite movies! Now waiting for ""Pool Hall Junkies"" to come on BD"
1,HD Picture?,"I was looking forward to picking this up on blu ray and couldn't be more disappointed in the picture quality of this disc. Most disappointing blu ray disc purchase I've made to date. At no point do you think you're watching a high def movie.[Edit] This is exactly the same so called ""HD"" print that they've shown on HBOHD and CinemaxHD since long before the blu ray was released. I'm watching it on Cinemax right now and there is no difference whatsoever between this version and the blu ray.This movie deserved a lot better treatment than this. I can't enjoy the blu ray because I'm constantly thinking how bad the picture looks. Disney has told me they will refund the money for this, I suggest anyone who feels like they got shortchanged buying this contact them."
3,"Slow, mediocre film.","After reading all the hype about ""Color of Money"" I decided I simply must see this ""great"" movie... I was greatly dissapointed.The movie starts slow, continues at a crawling pace, and then limps across the finish line. The script is terrible with absolutely no meat to the plot. The only good parts of the film were the trick shots by some of the hustlers.Don't waste your time with ""Color of Money."""
5,"Great, fast, fun read",The story takes you into the highs and the lows and the real life of the heroine. You feel for her....and love her. Very readable.
2,ok good but not complete.,Some content such as collections are not really comprehensive and some code even not work well. And this book is so basic book and the example code is not represented the knowledge. Avoid this book if you really want to improve your java ability.
2,Law school takes three years after college,"There's something really wrong with the premise of this book. The heroine is 31. Supposedly, rather than marry the hero right after college graduation ten years previously, she had received a job offer from a law firm in Boston and taken it. However, law school takes three years after college graduation. Then there's the little matter of taking the Bar exam.If neither the author nor the editor had caught anything so blatantly wrong, then probably the rest of the story isn't worth the effort of reading it."
3,Surprise,"The delivery of the book was prompt, yes, but... once I had this book in my hands I realized- to my anxiety- that the book was VERY old. I am actually a bit worried to read it in fear that it will fall apart. Don't get me wrong, it looks like it has been well kept and taken care of, but i just wish it had been been printed earlier than circa 1925."
3,It's Okay,"I purchased the item, because it was recommended by a friend, I was not THRILLED with it. I perferr some of his other music."
3,You get what you pay for,"Mat seems to have a slippery coating on it, hopefully that will wear off over time. All in all, a decent mat, but not the highest quality."
5,Great value!,"I love this mat! High quality for an inexpensive price. I ordered the light blue, and it's actually a little darker than pictured. Not by much, though. Not a big deal. The thickness is perfect for my bony dinosaur spine. Perfect comfort. The thickness didn't throw my balance off at all. I would definitely buy this product again."
5,Does the job,Provides a nice padded surface and the perfect size for me. Definitely a quality product.
4,"Nice, heavy mat","This yoga mat, purchased as a gift, is nice heavy textured material that readily layed flat. The 'dark green' color I ordered is actually teal, not dark green. Therefore, while the teal is a nice shade (and we kept it), it is not dark and it is certainly not green; and the inaccuracy of the color description warranted a reduction in stars. Should they change the official description to teal, this product gets 5 stars.Shipping was about $10, which seemed pricey, but the quality of the mat made it worth the $30 total."
5,Good Purchase,"I have received my order in a time manner and without a problem. I am very satisfied with my purchase. It's an excellent yoga mat for beginners. It provides good cushion, length and variety of colors. All I had to do was open the package immediately upon arrival, wash it with cold water only and hang for 48 hours to allow it to dry completely and get rid off any smell residue.If you are considering getting yourself a yoga mat I highly recommend this one to start with."
3,Everything Yoga Ultra Yoga Mat,"The description sounded great and the price was right. It's true that they are thick, but our members are obviously hooked on the SPRI mats. They complained that these mats were not sticky enough."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this mat so i could stop renting from the yoga studio I go to. Unfortunately, the mat did not even last 5 minutes of class. I was slipping all over it like a slip n slide. Now I'm looking for a mat that has more grip, and perhaps has a higher pricetag."
1,Wrong product,"Ordeted the 1/4"" thick mat in teal, they sent me an 1/8"" thick in blue. I contacted them and they told me it would be fixed and would send a new one. It's been over 3 weeks, I've emailed the seller with no more responses. Very disappointed. However, the 1/8th thick mat is nice, it was not what I wanted."
2,Nice thickness - Wrong Color,"I ordered the soft pink color and received a hot pink, almost fushia, mat. This hot pink is not very calming or restful. The mat is nice and thick so it does makes yoga more comfortable. I would recommend this mat based on the thickness alone...as long as you are not picky about the color you receive."
4,Very prompt,"This book was well worth the money I spent, it was delivered to me in quick timing, and was in almost perfect sondition."
3,Beautiful story,"Beautiful story, well done. Would like to see more of the leading lady in other things. Not the ending I would have hoped for but probably more true to life."
1,Bad Idea,This is a charity item. Buy this through Janis Ian's website only so the money will go to the needy.
4,etrex Legend,"Nice, compact unit. Sturdy and fairly easy to use. The joystick, might be better as a touchpad or some such thing. The accuracy is where this item really shines. All in all a good deal and I will probably warm to it the more I use it."
1,Not pleased,"Have owned for about 2 years. Worked OK for a while. First thing was the rubber band glued to unit started to peel off. Sticky stuff all over, apparently a common problem Garmin knows about and has no solution. Unit gets flaky when zooming in and out, zooms in when zooming out and vice versa. Regularly back up my marks to my PC. During my last attempt the software decided to update. 2 years worth of saved marks and way points gone from device and computer, computer no longer recognizes device. Put original software on different computer still won't recognize. Seems like a premium price for a sub par product."
4,First GPS,"This is the first GPS that I have been able to use. I purchased a Magellan Triton several years ago but it was so user unfriendly, it is still in the box. I have been able to use the odometer, track my path so far. The downloading of maps and installing in my GPS my prove to be VERY difficult according to reviews, hints, advice. Good luck."
4,Handy Device,"Handy device for marking locations, saving routes, and navigating in the wilderness. The Geocaching feature is interesting. Sometimes takes a while to acquire signal. Battery life good."
4,Economical Geocaching GPS,"Great price. I love the joystick feature. It makes it so much easier to move around the screen and make selections. Great for geocaching, although I wish it refreshed a little faster."
4,Pleasant surprise!,"After watching Smoke Signals I searched for more movies about and made with authenic characters. Some of the main actors were notNative Americans but came accross very well. I was surprised to see the dad from Smoke Signals as basically the main character in this movie. He has a voice and mannerisms that catch the attention of any movie watcher. Some of the parts were a little cheesy, but I really enjoyed this movie."
5,Couldn't put this down,"It's rare that I read an entire novel at one stretch, but this novel gripped me from start to finish. It's a mix of gentle farce (a la Jeeves) and not-so-gentle black comedy. Warning: there's a lot of blood and gore."
1,"70-odd minutes of per, unadulterated - ""what the hell is this?""!","This movie has already been released straight-to-video here and even though I only paid $4.00 to see it - I want my money back! What the hell was it supposed to be about? Where were the 7 mummies? Strewn all over the place, it seems. The storyline/screenplay was bad, the editing was bad, the acting was bad, the action scenes were shocking - some of those punches didn't even connect! And when we finally see one of the mummies, you can actually see the actor's lip/tongue beneath the mask!!I can find not one redeeming feature and I sat through 70-odd minutes waiting for one! I think it was a good idea (maybe a redeeming feature, but already done so well in 'From Dusk til Dawn') that just did not work.Terrible, terrible, terrible. It gets one star because I'm really a very generous person.Can someone please give me back my $4.00 and my 70-odd minutes lost to this piece of ... bleurgh."
4,The basics,I got this book for a Master's Level course. It was a good and interesting read to see how the groundwork of communication theory was structured into what we know today. Definately reccomend it for introductory communication courses.
4,Good movie,"The video is a little cheaply made but I am not complaining, it plays very well in my DVD player so all is well."
4,Great movie but poor DVD picture does not do it justice,"One of the things that makes this movie great is its exceptionally clear and well-framed cinematography. Unfortunately, the color on this DVD is not nearly as spectacular as in the theater. In addition, in some scenes it is obvious that the film has been cropped. This is a movie that cries out to be remastered and reissued in Blu Ray."
3,"It's not great, but it's fun","I got this movie via Netflix the other day and I have to be honest; this is not a good movie. It's predictable, the acting is bad, the production value is low, and it's pretty much a big cliche. With that said, I really liked it. It's unapologetic for its faults and is just a fun martial arts movie. If you like martial arts films, you'll enjoy this. If you're looking for something other than some guys kicking each other in the face, then you should probably give this one a pass."
3,Get ready for the song.,"This isn't a bad film. It has action and a strong moral message. PLOT: Martial arts instructor teaches inner city kids how to fight to music. Then an evil drug dealer shows up and suspiciously knows how to fight in the exact same way. The song is absolutely addictive, anyone thats seen this film knows what we're talking about."
5,What is a University for?,"This is a perennial classic on university education.At a time where many university departments have (again) collapsed into technical and professional training institutes, vying to serve the dictates of independent (professional) bodies; at a time where the academic is no longer protected from the vagaries of political influence (on account of the politics insinuated into the evaluation of academic work) this book is a must-read, especially for those involved directly in higher learning--teachers and students alike. The value of Hutchins' work extends beyond the time of writing, and is arguably as important today as ever.For anyone who has known the thrill of truly inspired teaching, and the pleasure and vigour of the examined life that follows from an informed exposure to classics, Hutchins' book lays a plan for their achievement and preservation at the university. Buy before it goes out of print."
1,NOT the orginal hits!,"I was very much looking toward to listening to the old hits that I enjoyed many years ago. I was very disappointed. The tunes on this CD are nowhere near as good as the orginal hits. Hard to believe that they are sung by the orginal artists. I wasted my money. I""d like to throw it in the trash!"
4,great creativity toy,"My grandson spends hours making things noone else quite understands, but he loves it and it's better than video games"
2,Interesting Concept - Stale Plot,"Not necessarily Hammer's finest production, Four-Sided Triangle is interesting for its central concept, but a stale plot makes for a mostly dated and anemic film. The writer couldn't seem to make up his mind whether he wanted to emphasize the Frankenstein elements or be cloying and sympathetic to the plight of the scientist. The indecision costs the film dearly, as we end up mostly being bored stiff. Still, it wins a few stars for being novel for the era. Hammer fans will find little here that connects to the classics, as this film was produced in 1953, well before even the earliest hit, The Quatermass Experiment in 1955. There was one other upshot though, it was directed by Terence Fisher."
4,DARN GOOD TOOL/INSTRUMENT,"I have recently been exploring SUNGAZING and I wanted to be responsible regarding the care of my eyes. This monitor is exceedingly user friendly regarding UV readings with the added plus of giving an estimated time for being safe in the sun light. I also use the time function as I have recently dispensed with wearing a watch on my wrist. I'm interested in temperature as well but only in a casual way. The monitor is a bit slow in terms of adjusting for the temperature, but this might be a good thing in that so many things seem to be moving so fast here in 2011. My primary interest is in acquiring a quick(four seconds) read on UV light and this small unit fits the bill perfectly."
3,Only works for UV rays from direct sunlight,"I thought it would work to measure the UV rays from lamps or the sunlight that enters trough the windows, but no... it only works if you expose it to direct sunlight, wich is ok, but I think it should be noted in the product's description. What I need is something like this: http://www.amazon.com/General-UV513AB-Digital-Ultraviolet-Measurement/dp/B002JOR0JO/ref=rsl_mainw_dpl?ie=UTF8&m;=ATVPDKIKX0DERBut it's a lot more expensive..."
2,Dull Book,Got to page 62...must have been desperate for something to read. I recommend......Give this one a pass.Pop
4,Interesting look at key point & place in US history,"I enjoyed these books very much. They give an excellent overview not only of the flora and fauna of the north plains in the late 1800s, but also an interesting perspective on the people of the place and TR. The only drawback was the writing was a bit dated, and the two books were a bit overlapping in subject. Nonetheless, highly recommended to anyone interested in the outdoors, US history, and/or TR."
5,When a novice wants to be a pro,"I bought this item because I was sick of buying disposible bakeware. I love Cuisinart's Cookware, so why not. I LOVE IT!The first thing I made was brownies. Sprayed the pan and in the oven it went. The brownies came out perfect. Where they usually get too well done around the edges, that did not happen. There were no underdone spots either.The clean up was fast. I also purchased the pie pan and the 9"" oval pan. I am very happy with this purchase and will buy more pieces."
4,Vitamins for the brain,This is one of the more effective supppliments you can take for your mental accuity. I have been taking it for years. This is a good product.
2,Not sure it's doing anything.,"I've been taking 3 tablets a day for a couple of months now and I can't tell any difference between now and when I first started taking them. Once I run out, I won't be buying anymore. While there might be some advantage to taking these, I'm either not aware of the changes or my body is metabolizing these out of my system before they can take effect."
1,Made me feel drunk...don't recommend.,"This product gave me a headache and made me feel disoriented, almost like I was drunk. It took about 3 days to feel normal again and 'with it'. What a waste of money, I don't recommend it."
5,Best B-movie of the 1980s.,"Pay no heed to some of the desciptions of this film as being graphic or unreasonably exploitive. This film is actually,at least in the context of Taxi Driver,a deceptively witty stab at cinematic misogyny that was almost inescapable throughout the very peculiar 1980s. The photography and editing are superb indicating ferrara as a major talent. Unfortunately his work,much like Scorsese's, does tend to be somewhat digested incorrectly by the more meat-headed of movie lovers I could see this DVD sitting on a shelf , unfortunately I might add,next to something along the lines of The Usual Suspects or blecht!Fight club.However the lead's hypnotic almost silent film performance along with the film's hip downtown New York score will keep this one from ever going stale."
4,How come...,"Hey,why is it that I'm the only one to review this cult classic? C'mon it was VERY well-done, and the ending- Whoa, that was among the greats. RIP to Zoe Tamerlis."
2,Demented story and lousy acting....,"I viewed this movie only out of curiosity and couldn't believe I paid money for it! While ""Ms. 45"" may have something of a cult following, and Zoe Tamerlis is slightly intriguing in the lead, there are some handicaps the film just can't get past.Namely - a very implausible story line and some dreadful acting! Tamerlis is raped in broad daylight twice - on the street and in her apartment. And it appears as if she and her co-workers are verbally assaulted by every sleazy male in Manhattan! It got a bit ridiculous after a while and lost all credibility for me once Zoe turned vigilante against anyone male. None of the other players in the film can read a single line to sound convincing. At one point, I wondered if ""Ms. 45"" was supposed to be a black comedy, but it didn't work whatever the intention was! Not really sure what to make of this very bizarre flick, but I can't recommend it very highly."
1,"Not the ""Captives"" you may think it is!","I ordered this thinking it was the movie ""Captives"" starring Tim Roth and Julia Ormond - NOT!!! This is a gay porno movie filmed on location in South Africa and NOT starring Tim Roth and Julia Ormond! Boy was I surprised!!"
4,great umrella cover,"great umbrella cover for the price, fit is snug and easy to remove.Only complain is the string in the bottom could have been a tan color also to match the cover instead of black. But overall very happy with the product."
2,A Tired Plot that Doesn't Entertain In This Day and Age,"How many movies have been made about a serial killer coming back from the dead to kill again? ""Shocker"" and ""Jack Frost"" are just to name a couple, each better than this movie. This movie just offers nothing more than what has been done a hundred times, but this movie is still a little more enjoyable than ""Jack Frost 2"". The acting is alright, but the death scenes aren't that interesting and neither is the plot. I actually almost feel asleep on more than one occasion, I think may actually have at one point. Not scary at all and no real good death scenes, the best out of all death scenes is when electricity makes a man boil. Even the end of the movie was unimpressive. Overall, a movie few would enjoy, especially not worth buying."
2,"Nice concept, badly worked out","The main concept for this movie is certainly a good one, and it is the concept that will be talked about for a while. Unfortunately it has not been worked out properly.The idea is simple, some strange serial killer kills people that are in an addressbook. He ends up as a computerprogram and tries to kill that woman from ""Raiders of the lost Ark"" and her son. He starts with some people in her addressbook, those scenes are pretty gruesome. She is hlped by that rightwing guy from American Beauty who is a renowned hacker. Thanks to a 'great' idea they get the job done.As I said before, the concept will last a while. The acting jobs done will not. The special effects are sometimes really bad and I do think they could have done better in 1993.A Magnetic end indeed, but for other reasons."
4,The Complete Annotated Gilbert and Sullivan,"The book nicely provides the (almost) complete librettos with detailed notes on, among other things, the various versions from preproduction onward to twentieth century changes, the origins, the inspirations, and the meaning of words Bradley thinks are obscure. He is much more likely to explain reasonably familiar words than to assume too much. The introductions nicely trace the history down to the most recent productions. Those who have seen the current movie Topsy-Turvy will find the notes helpful in seeing some of the actual events depicted in the movie. The one omission is Thespis, the first collaboration. The libretto, but not the score, survived. Two areas of omission are exhaustive treatment of either the major performers or recordings. However, this is an excellent source for lovers of G&S."
5,A must for any G&S Fan,"This is the only book for a true Gilbert and Sullivan fan, especially since it literally is the only complete collection of their works available today for purchase. Luckily, it's a good one: it includes all of their Savoy operettas as well as their lesser-known later works such as Utopia Ltd. The real jewels of the collection, however, remain their best operas: HMS Pinafore, The Mikado, The Pirates of Penzance, The Sorcerer. This book is especially helpful because it contains all of the lyrics to all of the songs, and most CD recordings of the operas do not come with the lyrics (for many of the songs, it is impossible to catch all of the words simply by hearing them). Ian Bradley's notes, printed off to the side, are also interesting and help shed light on obscure words and phrases. Enjoy!"
5,The perfect gift for the G & S fanatic,"Ok, full disclosure: I am a G & S fanatic, have been since I played Ralph Rackstraw in Pinafore in the 8th grade, and produced (directed, accompanied) Pirates and Mikado in summer camps, and sang a super potpourri from Mikado in the New York All-City High School Chorus 60 years ago. All the librettos are here with useful annotations, especially for Americans for whom many of the references draw a blank - Gilbert's references to topical events and contemporary persons, and words which were sometimes rare even then, and Sullivan's to Handel, Verdi, &c. There is also much material on the development of the operettas, different versions, the inspiration for a song. Finally, it's helpful in catching all the words of the patter songs which rattle along sometimes faster than one can hear. It's all wonderful stuff and makes one yearn for a counterpart to satirize today's Washington circus."
1,outdated Bible version,Kindle is not the best medium for this book and this is certainly not the best version of the Bible available. It is very old and probably predates much of the twentieth century research.
5,the bible book by book,This is an excellent overview of each book of the Bible. Would highly recommend this book to anyone that loves Bible study.
2,Trite Psychobabble,"Over a period of decades sociologists have noticed an interesting trend: people who win Nobel Prizes, run large corporations, championship athletes, etc. tend to have high levels of self-esteem. Conversely, many of the unaccomplished tend to have low self-esteem. In this chicken vs. egg analogy, Steinem and her fellow travelers have arrived at the conclusion that achievement is a derivative of self-esteem. Wrong. Self-esteem, like everything else worth having, is earned. You cannot be given ""self-esteem pills"". If it makes Steinem feel any better, a generation is being inculcated with the values she espouses in this book i.e. ""I'm OK, You're OK"". Later in life, when confronted by failure, these citizens won't look for the causes in themselves (""It can't be my fault, I'm OK""). They will reach for politicians and leaders on the right and the left who will be more than happy to supply scapegoats."
3,I really really want to give this a higher rating ...,"... but I just *can't* do it.Most of the book, I loved, orat least enjoyed.However, there's a problem with it. Like manyfeminists, Steinem has been suckered into believing in the vast underground world-wide conspiracy of Satan-worshippers doing unspeakable things to children who don't remember any of it for the next 15 years ....That bothers me. Having such an influential voice of modern feminism put her weight behind a movement that does more to make working mothers feel guilty about sending their children to daycare than it actually does to empower ANYone, in support of a phenomenon that any rational person can see does not exist, is a tragic waste of talent.If you can manage to tune out that aspect, enjoy the book..."
5,Classy Classic,"My 1.5 year old is already a fan of this book. We bought it because she's fascinated with ducks. The realistic illustrations and complex sentences are a nice change of pace from most of her more recently published children's' books. The story has a bit of intrigue, a quick pace, and a humorous ending. It's just perfect."
4,A mixed bag,"I really hesitated on giving this four stars, but felt I had no choice. While there are several excellent episodes in the final season, there are some real clunkers as well--and by clunkers, I mean putridly bad episodes that should never have been filmed.Do note that there are several episodes where Adrian Paul (by contract) did not appear.Still, it's a must have for Highlander fans."
2,Great Try...but no thanks,"It's long been suspected that either Wyatt Earp embellished the stories told to Lake, Lake embellished the stories Earp told him OR Wyatt's WIFE encouraged Stuart Lake to embellish the stories through her own exaggerations and what not... whatever the case, this story is not the true tale of Wyatt Earp, the man.It's a decent fictional account and contains many of the legends that made him famous, but ultimately time has revealed it for what it is... a yarn.Read it to be entertained, but don't read it if you're wanting to know the true Wyatt Earp."
5,Dedicated Seller,"Some strange reason, the book I ordered didn't delivered first time (post office returned to the sender). Without further fuss, this seller sent me second time, apologizing the trouble, like it was his own fault. The total shipping charge must be more than the price I paid for. I strongly recommend this seller for his great business practice."
3,Entertained but cautious.,"I bought this book at a used book store in Chicago, and I'm two thirds of the way through it. While I have no way to verify or discredit his claims, they seem pretty outrageous. He contends that the Mossad manipulates not only Israeli policy, but the foreign policies of the United States (without our knowledge until now that he has become a whistleblower). While it is entertaining reading and has peaked my interest in Israel, I must take everything in the book with a grain of salt. So I'll go with the middle: three stars."
3,Kindle edition,"This review is about the Kindle edition of this book.While the book itself is a nice read, and it even thought me some new stuff I didn't know before about certain events, it was full of spelling mistakes, especially in characters names. Some letters were misspelled with numbers...It looks to me like those mistakes were due to poor OCR of the original paper book (it's quite old by now).But I sure expected better QC from Amazon on books - I'm sure nobody read it before publication!"
4,thrilling,"I read this book with a grain of salt. Readers should be aware the author states that parts of the book are false. As to which parts, you'll have to decide for yourself. What impressed me most about this book was the description of the training that goes into becoming a mossad agent. I had no idea how much training was required. A very small percentage graduate to becoming a mossad agent and sometimes, entire classes fail to graduate.The insight into the various mossad missions was also very interesting.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the mossad."
1,Interesting but fodder for anti-Semites,"I question Ostrovsky's motives for writing this book. I'm sure the Mossad has done many things that all governments have done and still do within the realm of spying and making secret deals with other countries. However, they are no worse than the CIA or any other such group. I also had the feeling that he is getting revenge on coworkers and authority figures with whom he had problems. Everyone in the Mossad cannot possibly be as evil as he portrays them to be. And why shouldn't Jews in other countries be willing to help Israel? I would also like to add that this book is found and quoted on many anti-Semitic and hate websites."
2,Were okay for less than a year...but then terrible,I buy a lot of items on Amazon...and have never written a review before. We just built a pool and purchased some nice furniture so I wanted to buy some covers for our chaise lounge chairs. These covers were a great price...and were great for a few months. We have had them for approximately a year...and they are absolutely terrible. Completely falling apart with large holes in many of the covers. The price is definitely cheap...but I don't think it is unreasonable to expect them to be able to hold up under normal conditions. They are really bad.I am looking on Amazon and hoping to buy some that are better quality.
5,Great if you like British comedy,"If you enjoy British comedy (Allo Allo, Yes Minister, etc.), you will love the Mind Your Language Series. It had great ratings back in the day.I just wish that all the original episodes were put onto the DVD but some are missing. It isn't just the DVD's on Amazon that are missing them though - no website (that I could find) has all episodes."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"These are exactly as advertised and perform just fine. No surprises, which is always nice. Would purchase again if needed."
4,Strong Debut,"I really enjoyed this book. It was one of few I looked forward to while at work. Leah Stewart did a wonderful job of creating believable characters and a suspenseful plot, while also brilliantly conveying the atmosphere of it's setting - Memphis. This is my favorite book of it's kind since Mystic River, and I look forward to more from this author."
3,Ummm . . . Okay for the basics,"Lorna fills in the blanks with some good tips from her experience like using more water than the recipe calls for to make up for the fluid lost by the steam. The recipes were not glamorous--just basic recipes. I read a few and tried them but nothing really stood out as a favorite to go back to . I did make the risotto in the pressure cooker using her recipe and I was impressed that it was so well cooked and not hard/crunchy. And, I didn't have to stir it for 20 mins to add the fluids but i like my other recipes better--more flavor.I'll try more recipes and update this as I go. The book was highly recommended by others so maybe I am missing something."
4,good recipes and tips,"I just got my pressure cooker and liked the tips on use, quick release, fabulous risotto recipes. Makes me feel confident in cooking with my cooker."
5,Thanks just what I was looking for,I had loaned my copy to a family memeber and have missed having it availalbe. Great recipes for the pressure cooker
5,I'm not ALWAYS the Dork!,"Well okay, so maybe I do always end up being the Dork but it really isn't so bad! Emerging from the 'Gene Pool' as a Dork or a Keener, cruisin down Earwax Way and a trip to Another Dimension - there is no other experience like it! A great time for any party or get together and a better way to act like you often feel!"
3,Maybe not this year?,"I wasn't sure once I'd gotten this why I bought it. All it was worth was the 30-something pages it was written on. None of the quizzes were relevant to the partner study book, and I truly felt I had been cheated by this book. It's not worth your money."
4,"Good Slide Covers, Bad Packaging","The plastic slide covers are exactly as I thought when purchasing, but the packaging is completely different from what is pictured on the site. I was buying these for my son's birthday, and was hoping for something like the nice box pictured, but ended up with a chintzy cardboard deal, not even a quarter of the size shown in the picture I referred to when I was buying the product. They still will serve their purpose, but that storage box pictured would have been nice..."
4,Great slips--but come in a different box than pictured,"These are what they say they are: plastic slide slips. They do what they're supposed to do. The only thing I would mention is that they do not not come in the plastic case pictured, but rather a regular old cardboard box, which nevertheless serves its purpose."
5,Awe inspiring lyrics with classic uniqueness of his band,To me this album is one of the best of my collection.I listen to it religously.don van vliet is truly one of the greatest lyricist of our time.He presents his art with such an edge no one will ever be able to reach.The magic band is very talented and well versed in their skills.Buy this album! No matter what genre you dig beefheart will not let you down.
4,"Scenery, Music, Action, even Drama","Actually this is to second the review by Don Carroll of Atlanta who points out the role background music plays in Republic serials and westerns. I am hearing ""Painted Stallion"" this very moment. After seeing the two King serials, I had a mad desire to know where they were filmed. One version said Lake Arrowhead( California) and another said Bear Lake, California. Help is appreciated. Having received the highest musical aptitude score ever in my home county, I withstood the slings and arrows of peers and adults defending what I knew was the high creative quality and originality. This time I am including my email and invite all Republic music lovers to do likewise. Maybe there are more CDs possible to go with those already produced by James King, may he be blessed. I am rljones@suddenlink.net."
4,Perfect name for a nearly perfect movie,"Meg Ryan's character is afraid to fly, so she can't join her Canadian fiancee (played by Timothy Hutton) in Paris for a convention. But when he telephones to say he has met a ""goddess"" and is reconsidering their relationship, she forces herself onto the plane, where she meets the oh-so-gallic Luc (Kevin Kline). She doesn't know it yet, but she and Luc have some unfinished business.""French Kiss"" is a perfect title for this Continental tease of a comedy that combines elements of romance, screwball comedy, and a touch of international intrigue. Ryan and Kline seemed perfectly cast even if he is a good deal older than she. It isn't a magnificent movie, but it's quite a good one and much better than the critics would have us believe. A welcome souffle for any fans of Ryan, Kline, or for romantics anywhere."
4,Worth the time,"One of Meg Ryan's better films. Less predictable and boring than Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. Some of the scenes I found truly funny, and the plot took unexpected turns. Kevin Kline does a great Frenchman. I found myself feeling really bad for the characters when they were suffering."
3,Hardly either star's best film,"We've all seen Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline do much better than this film. But this serves well as a romance to watch on a rainy day. The scenery is fantastic and Kline, one you can always count on to turn in a fantastic performance, is great (at his ""bad little boy"" best). But Ryan appears to be trying to outshine Kline by going COMPLETELY over the top into shrillness instead of just shining by being real. But I forgive almost anything that puts Kevin Kline in a film!"
5,French Kiss,"Just a great movie. I feel this is one of Meg Ryan's best works. If you've been to Paris and France, you'll love it. if you haven't, you'll definitely want to go. It captures the whole spirit of French living with entertainment at it's best. I re-watch it at least 8 times per year."
3,Kitten-cute but pretty silly,"Our adorable heroine, Meg Ryan actually engages in some slapstick humor in this rather amusing little romantic comedy. She plays the ditzy young wife of a no-good two-timer who runs off to France with a leggy supermodel. So Meg decides to tail them - but too bad she's so scared of airplanes! And then - after lounging luxuriously in fancy hotels and some sightseeing in the fabulous Paris (she keeps missing the city's greatest landmark of all), our dear blonde bombshell falls for some ratty-looking wino who looks just like a pervert or something and humiliates herself in public when her angelic young face gets all smeared with some pastries from the dessert cart. But the most ridiculous of all is the very ending that left me very bewildered and puzzled about the very content of that girl's head. Good thing I don't really believe in fairy tales anyway!"
5,One of the best romantic movies ever made,"I love this movie. It is so funny and romantic. Meg Ryan is awesome in this movie, she is so cute, you can't help just feel like your in her shoes or something. She really rocks in this movie. Kevin Kline, you fall in love with his personality. He pulls off a great French accent. Also, he is hilarious. Everytime I watch this movie, I just feel like I want to go to France. Great job, worth every penny. Get it, it's worth it."
5,I give it 20 stars!!,"The critics were wrong about this movie. SO wrong! ""French Kiss"" is fabulously sweet, quirky, funny, loveable and charming! Kevin and Meg are wonderful and they have a good supporting cast. Meg is at her most charming and Kevin is a very appealing Frenchman! They are adorable together and the movie is cute and fun. ""French Kiss"" has a variety of scenes (sad, funny, sweet, silly and serious); has many quotable lines (""I don't like the way you say with your face all scrunched up 'Your French aren't you?'"" & ""Just feel guilty. Swim in it until your fingers get all pruney"" & ""Do I have to say it!?"" - ""Am I going to be able to stop you!?""); beautiful music and spectacular scenery. The cutest/funniest scenes are right after she eats a bunch of cheese; when she shows him the necklace she is wearing; the accident with the dessert cart and the beach scene. Such an enchanting movie! Don't listen to the critics... you will love it!"
5,"For a guy who hates romatic movies, I loved this one","I have watched this one four times. Every time seems like the first. I really like this one. I am normally a Black Hawk Down kind of guy. However, this is one of the few chick-flicks I like. Eventhough you know Kevin Klien is a total American, he does a great job of being a French thief. And for what? It turns out he just wants to have his own winery in the French country side. This happens to be one of my dreams. This is the kind of movie I think women can get their football loving husband to watch."
3,4:3 Letterboxed,"The 2003 re-release is 4:3 Letterboxed, as was the original. Not true widescreen. There is also a 2009 re-release... also 4:3 Letterboxed."
1,French KIss,please save your money I didn't. She is too young for him and he is too old for hertry too return it and couldn't the tape is damaged I had too turn up the speakersand still couldn't hear them. The beach seens were very nice.
2,Follow Tom Keogh's Editorial Review,This movie fails in establishing a story and characters one could warmly relate to. I mean Meg's character behaves too juvenile (to put it mildly) while the other lead character has no charisma even though the screenwriter tries to make him look like an expert in communicating with a flight-shy and awkward-with-men woman.
3,Young Lancelot defends the kingdom,"These are episodes of the 1956 TV series about young Lancelot's arrival at Camelot and his subsequent efforts to defend of the members of the court of King Arthur from enemies without and within. The four black & white episodes are ""Ferocious Fathers,"" ""The Outcast,"" ""The Ruby of Radnor"" and ""The Lady Lilith."" Although this is labeled Volume 1, Critics' Choice has not released a second volume."
5,Truly the American Bible.,"This is one of Neruda's greatest books. It is a jorney through the history of the American Continent, from its creation, to its conquest until the present day. Most readers will know it from its chapter 'Hights of Machu Picchu' but it is certainly more than that.It is a review of 500 hundred years of history, of war, of love, of betray. Obviously the book is a reflection of Neruda's left wing inclination, but that only adds to the book.In Chile and other parts of Latin America this book is called ""The American Bible"" and it truly is. Along with Residencia en la Tierra, it is probably Neruda's finest. And is probably the book in which Neruda became what he though his role as a poet ought to be ""a voice for all who had no voice""."
2,Disappointing,"I got this dvd because I was interested in learning some very basic, but authentic, steps in different dance styles, and get a fun workout at the same time. If you are seeking the same things, don't waste your time with this dvd. I've studied flamenco dance for several years, and the ""flamenco"" she demonstrates is not only partially authentic at best, but her style is not good. I figured that the other styles were demonstrated in a similarly flawed fashion, so lost interest.If your goal is simply to get a new and fun workout, the dvd is somewhat more successful. I had a problem however with her demonstration, because she does it facing the viewer - and anyone who's taken dance classes knows that the instructor faces the mirror, not the viewer. This way you can imitate the steps easily without have to transpose them in your mind first. Personally, I found it frustrating."
2,Not a Work out DVD,"This DVD didn't motivate me. Its not a workout DVD, however if I'm looking to learn dance moves its great!!"
1,So disapointing !!! Not worth the money,"I had a small knowledge of belly dancing and of flamenco and I both love those dances. I was very disapointed with the DVD. Not a lot of explainations, very few technique. It's gonna go in my next garage sale."
2,Disappointing,"I have to say that I was disappointed with this DVD. The variety of dance styles it shows is nice, but the bellydance and bollywood sections were awful. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it is the only DVD I've found so far that even touches on the flamenco style, which I've become interested in lately."
3,A little weird for me..,At first glance I didn't like the DVD because the lady dancer is quite odd in my opinion. I don't know if it's the way she talks or just she moves oddly but it kind of freaked me out. After actually trying some of the moves I realized that i perhaps could learn something new from this dvd. This dvd is not too challenging but there are things you can learn from it. I recommend it for some one who wants a basic overview on each dance genre.
3,Pretty Good,"I thought the steps could have been better explained, but for the amount of dance styles included (5) I suppose this is a pretty good instructionlal DVD.If you want to really learn a lot about each dance, then perhaps you'd be better off buying a DVD that focuses on a single dance style.Overall I think ir's pretty good for the money."
3,"Trippy, but fun.","Overall, a fun dvd. I thought that Elsa moves well and is in pretty good shape for a lady who seems to be of a certain age. She's a decent teacher, and seemed to be having a good time. Her enthusiasm and passion for dance really come through.The yarn ball outfit for the samba was a hoot!"
3,Not bad,"The description is a little misleading. There is nudity missing that was in the original film. Overall one can watch it and not be disappointed. It you are looking for an all gay film though, this is not it."
4,I love the oldies!,"While I also like more recent sci-fi and horror flicks, I still have a place in my heart for the classics, which I consider this film to be. The special effects were very good for its time, but I really liked the way the story developed without the ""cheesy"" technique of having the ""snowman"" chase people around on-screen throughout. Having the creature lurking in the background, mostly unseen, gave the feel of the first Alien movie (not an exact analogy, of course). My copy was excellent, and very inexpensive: I looked at Amazon.com for several months, and found mostly used copies priced as high as $100. When I saw this offer of under $20 for new, I jumped quickly."
4,Will the real monster please stand up?,"This great Hammer classic stars Peter Cushing and Forrest Tucker in a gripping thriller set in the Himalayas. Forrest Tucker is Tom Friend a show biz con-man looking for a side show attraction. Aided by an innocent botanist (Cushings) Dr. Rollason. They hunt the great yeti until it is they who are hunted.This creature is definitely a female because of all the mind games it plays..(loosen up) We do not see the monster until the end. But by then you""ve already guessed who the real monster is....Larry Storch.(just kidding) Great acting and you feel the vastness of their surroundings. It must be seen in widescreen!"
3,Watered Down Hammer,"The Abominable Snowman is in a somewhat different vein from much of the Hammer films of this period. It aims to be more philosophical rather than horrific and comes across more as a long (too long) Twilight Zone or original Star Trek episode (particularly as the Himalayas looked much like a snowish covered version of the planets in which the crew always seemed to find themselves) which is not what one is necessarily looking for in what was once a feature film. The actors, particularly, of course, Peter Cushing, do good work and the film has nice intentions in its message but the slow build-up to the story is unnecessary when the time could have been used more effectively to develop the secondary characters and give a litte more back story to the leads, if not actually creating suspense. Not the best work from a great studio."
5,Love it!,"I have been using the regular BE for over 4 years now. I love that product, but I have really oily skin and it just seemed to be accentuated at times by the makeup. I recently bought the matte foundation and have been using it for a few days now. The oil reduction is noticeable and the makeup looks great. Don't expect it solve all of your skin problems - ie. large pores. Also, be aware that the makeup is a little heavier that the original BE foundation. Overall, however, I will take heavier over oilier! Will definitely purchase again!"
5,One of the best biographies I have ever read.,This was a very great man who dedicated his life to serving others. The photos were good and the writing was exceptional.
2,Good Overview - Outrageously Priced,Does a good job of providing an overview of the strategic and tactical marketing processes of companies. My only complaint is the cost/benefit ratio - this is a paperback book that is only 300 pages long - worth[less than price].
3,Decent but does not repel water,Decent product but does not repel water and the cover could be a little wider. Had a storm the other night and the cover does not repel water. Have to take the cover off and dry off the glass. Wish the cover was a little wider as it barely covers the sides of the table.
3,NOT MY FAVORITE COULTER WRITING STYLE,I PREFER HER FBI SERIES AND HISTORICAL NOVELS TO THIS CONTEMPORARY WRITING.
1,Not for the faint of heart.,I have reached page 94 of this book and already two horrific rapes have occurred. I have a feeling that I will not have the stomach to finish the book. Beware those who cannot stomach rapes scenes.
3,Over-the-top cartoon characters,"I often see Catherine Coulter's work on bestseller lists, but never had occasion to read one of her books. This reprint was enough to convince me that I wasn't missing anything. The good news is, it's a beach read. It's quick, and you can easily put it down while you go for a swim. The bad news is, the characters are more like caricatures than real people, so a mildly interesting plot goes to waste for lack of a hero or heroine who can handle it. The unbelievable venom in every sentence spoken by Eden's father and half-sister made me laugh rather than sympathize with the heroine, because it was so theatrical. It was also poorly edited. All the people in the book tended to speak with the same mannerisms and cut-off or run-on sentences, with only two or three exceptions. The best I can say for this book is that I think it had potential. If only it had lived up to it!"
5,Beyond Eden,"The first novel I read by Coulter was impulse, and I thought that it was a great suspense book. I thoroughly enjoyed the character development. Therefore I decided to read her others and particularly enjoyed Beyond Eden. While I am an avid fan of suspense novels, the romance in the story was quite touching. I have had the tendency to shy away from typical romance novels, but the hero was very refreshing. If you are looking to read about a great guy- a guy any woman would fall for, Taylor is it. This book offered more romance than suspense, but it was a pleasant surprise. I will definitely read her other novels."
1,"Bait & Switch ""Free"" Books deserve 0 Stars","According to Amazon: Amazon Bestsellers lists are updated hourly. Between list updates, the price of an item may change from being free to having a price and vice versa. Although the item's price changes immediately, the list and its rankings stay the same until the next hourly update.However, this book has been $6.99 since the day I found it on the Free List on Oct 19th.It's a book I read long ago & one of the reason Coulter fell off of my ""must buy authors"" list."
3,Needs to be longer,The cover does not come down over the chairs as much as I would like. The cover needs to be a little longer
2,Not Very Durable,Bought this cover in March 2010 and it ripped yesterday (August 30th 2011)... Would have expected a cover to last longer despite being exposed to one cold winter and one hot summer... Just spent $10 more and will try the Terrazo one...
3,Long drawn out story,"Okay I gave this book 3 stars because it was long winded and I had to make myself finish it. There was really no riveting part in the whole book that actually made you want to continue to read into the end. I only finished it because I hate leaving books undone. This book could have been finished in half as many pages. Also Maggie got on my nerves, she was so argumentative and judgemental. Hopefully the 2nd and 3rd books of this trilogy are way better."
4,The beginning of,a wonderful trilogy. I highly recommend getting all 3 of these books to all Nora Roberts fans.
5,First in an excellent series,"The 2nd Nora Roberts book I ever read was ""Born In Ice"", which I only later discovered was part of trilogy -- and the middle, at that. I enjoyed it then, but resolved to go out and read the whole trilogy. I'm glad I did!""Born In Fire"" sets the whole tone for the 2 books that follow. While the relationship between temperamental glassblowing artist Maggie and upper-crust gallery owner Rogan is obviously at the forefront of this tale, the larger tale being told is that of 2 sisters and how they are coming to grips with the death of their adoring father and the reality of the long, loveless marriage he shared with their cold, bitter mother. The relationship and interplay between Maggie, her sweet-natured sister Brianna, and their shrewish mother provides some of the best dialogue in the book.Maggie is a very well-developed character, who is so flawed and yet so wonderful that she is as human to the reader as one's own best friend might be."
3,The art of glass blowing is interesting,"It was kinda neat to read a story about a glass blowing artist. I love traveling to other countries with Nora Roberts. A reason I loved the Irish Trilogy. Born In Fire is a good book, but not my favorite by Nora. I did like the difficult characters in this book. I will definately read the rest of the Concannon sisters trilogy."
5,It is great to use with all the lights out and play my son loves it,I bought this control for my son he is 8 and he loves it. Great surprize for him to have a glow controler. I recommend it to all kids.
3,A little disappointed,"This is my first album from either artist and I have to say, that I was expecting a little more. Adult Swim really, really pushed this album so I bought it. MF Doom is very good at what he does. His rhymes are off the hook and Danger Mouse kicks butt with making beats. The clips from the Adult Swim crew are pretty funny. But, with the exception of a handful of songs, the album lacks that ""I wanna listen to it over and over again"" feel. I like the album, but maybe I was expecting too much from it."
3,A Little Disappointed...,"I might have been a little hard to only give three stars, but everyone else seems to be overzelous in their praise so I will balance the scales.Cutting to the chase, this album starts off well...I really enjoy both the production and the vocals...however after the first few tracks I started getting a little bored. It seems that, aside from a few guest appearances, it is just the same tempo and style the entire way through. I loved me some Gnarls, and really enjoy Beck's Modern Guilt, but this album is kind of half a@#ed in my opinion.To be clear though...worth the $7 I paid for it."
5,Best Rap CD I own,"I love this album and consider one of the most classic Rap album's I own. Having watched a lot of ATHF, I can relate. Great raps, great music, funny, this CD has it all. Essential for any collection."
5,Customer Review,I ordered this for my husband and he loved it. The condition was New and the price was reasonable. He loved the fact that it came with the booklet. Thanks rating is a five star
5,Dangerous Duo Indeed!,"Doom has struck again. After years in the Underground circuit, Doom links up with Danger Mouse to make some Damn good Music. I haven't heard Doom this good since Operation Doomsday. Not only are the rhymes tight, the beats supplied by Danger Mouse are Superb. If your a fan of Adult Swim then you can't go wrong with this album either. All the Favorite characters are there, from Stormy and Sparks of Sealab explaining the differences between the two Debbies to the MoonLight Invaders Asking you to ""taste their liquid gold"". All this makes for some funny skits and add Ghostface, Talib Kweli, and Cee-Lo Green and you have a groundbreaking masterpiece. Also, for an added treat, check Meatwads rhyming at the end of Bada Bing."
4,Sofa King Dope,"Doom pairs with the dj that brought us the Grey album and they deliver an awesome release. I haven't heard other stuff from Danger Mouse, but I will seek it out now. On the other hand, this is on par with Madvillain, Venomous Villain, Operation Doomsday and MM Food."
2,Horrible mix,"Wow... Whoever did the DVD audio portion needs to be shot on all of these re-releases. The cd remaster sounds great, however the dvd is mixed horribly. Heavily gated compression on the vocals that dominates the mix. The vocal is almost twice as loud as the music..Thin sounding mix on this one..So bad that I only listen to the cd and use the dvd for the extra features only. I also have a pretty accurate speaker system in my studio that I use for mixes, and being a producer, I know what I'm talking about..."
3,It is a good book,"The story is good but the story but it is a little slow in parts. Out of the first three book in the saga I give it a ""C"""
4,Wonderful remake!,I just loved this remake of this classic movie. Mara is just so precious in the role of Susan! Brings the classic tale into the present day. Well worth watching. . . more than once!
4,Solid remake and BR transfer solid,"Item arrived well packaged, on time and as described in the item description. Good quality and can easily recommend to others."
5,ENTERTAINING CHRISTMAS REMAKE OF THE OLD MOVIE,"THE LITTLE GIRL MAKES THIS MOVIE . AND THOUGH IT'S DATED NOW AND FILMED AT A LESS COMPLICATED TIME IN LIFE, IT HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. THE STORY CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WORK OUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE, BUT IT'S WELL ACTED AND HAS ENOUGH OF THE ELEMENTS OF GOOD WILL TO BE ENJOYED EACH YEAR."
3,"Classic? Not quite, but good enough for hot cocoa and your kids...",It's a cute movie. The leads are filmed in some sort of throwback glow that make it nostalgic and cheesy at the same time. Just like Christmas!
5,great,a wonderful holiday movie it can be a tradition in your family like mine thanks so much i now have both movies
3,Christmas gift to family,"I don't know how well the product performed, as I gave it away as a present, but I heard no complaints and assume it was okay."
4,a couple of good rarities,"This compilation has an edited version of ""Figure Of Eight"", which I believe is the same as the single version. There are two rarities on this CD which are worth the purchase to the serious collector; ""Party Party"" is a dance number, sounding pretty much from the era it was recorded in (late 1980s). ""I Wanna Cry"" is a slow, hard driving blues tune. Fairly sure these tracks were recorded during the ""Flowers In The Dirt"" sessions, since this disc was released around the same time. This was originally issued as a radio promo disc, and is indeed a rare find."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I was prompted to purchase this book because I saw the three young men on TV, and was impressed with them. I had just finished reading the Kite Runner which I loved, and this reminded me a little of that book-very little really. I found it to be too repetitious which is a polite way of saying boring after awhile."
3,Its Okay,This cord is an okay item but I think it might be a bit overpriced. I had no idea that I had 500 other sync cables in my junk drawer that could be used for this player. Also if you have a PSP the charger for it works perfect or a Casio cs100-200-300 they all use the same charger and I have one. I kicked myself lol. But you know what it does work and it works well. Just like the other reviewer posted. So if you dont have any cords like this one then i suggest purchasing this item.
4,Great Fun Again and Again,"My 10-month old girl never tires of this book, so we usually read it twice in a row. The first time through, she goes straight for the flaps. The second time through, we stop and feel the ""touchy"" parts of the book, talk about the animals, and find the duck. (It is the same duck from the ""Find the Duck"" book.)My only complaint is that the flaps are positioned in a way that makes it very easy to shut them in the book incorrectly. I have to hold the flap down to turn the page safely. However, when I finally let my daughter do things all on her own, I found that it is easy enough to re-bend the flaps. They probably won't last as long as I want them too, but they are sturdier than they look."
5,Much loved book,"What else to say than that our son loves this book? Probably the flaps will be torn off within few months, but sellotape will do and if not anymore, we'll order it again."
5,Useful,"This book is very informative, allowing a beginner (or more advanced member) of the craft to gather knowledge on commonly used implements/herbs/etc."
5,James (Thomas Toys) The Engine,"Very sturdy , a worthwhile toy, excellant!!!!!Well worth the Price and to purchase more in the Thomas train. Alot of fun for a child and very safe."
1,HO Train,"I was very disapointed in this item. It fell well short of what I expected. Even with the discount, In my opinion, this product is way way overpriced. The picture of the item on the web page was very misleading. It would have been nice if The web page had a more elaborate description to include the length of the item. I needed a HO Locomotive right away to use pulling our train around our Christmas tree. Amazon was very convenient, shipping was free and time was short. Item did arrive before the expected delivery date. The Locomotive was an HO but I had a constant problem keeping it on the rails especially when the train went through turnouts. When used with an assortment of various HO railroad cars the Locomotive looked to small and just didn't blend in at all. Since we only run the train at Christmas I will be shopping for a replacement before next Christmas."
4,Jodie Made All The Difference...,"All I have to say is that this is another movie in which Jodie proves to us that she's THE perfect acting machine! The movie itself is okay/good, but the unforgettable performance that Miss Foster gave made the movie better than if it would have been another actress instead of her playing the demanding and complex character of Nell."
5,great story and acting,This is such a wonderful story and all the actors were excellent in their parts. I think it was one of Natasha Richardson's best.
2,Nice performce from Foster in dull movie,"An impressive performance by Jodie Foster can't turn a dull script into a decent movie. The other characters are cardboard, containing no ambiguity, with each being villains out to destroy Nell or heroes out to save her. A weak, flowery too pat ending just makes things all the worse."
5,A very social movie - just brilliant,"It's one of my favorite movies, where Jodie Foster plays her role just perfect. The movie also shows the way how much the media folk tries to catch the most sensational stories. By the way: I'm a fanatic vintage denim rag collector. Has anybody noticed at the beginning of the movie the food delivery gay wearing an old worn out Levi's 501 redline Blue Jeans? If this pants still exists I really would like to buy them."
2,Haunted in Death belongs in morgue,"I have read and enjoyed every ""in Death"" book. They are so compelling, exciting, and sexy I find it difficult to put them down.I had to force myself to finish this one. Nora, I know you can do soooo much better. If Eve Dallas read this she would turn in her shield and stunner."
3,looking for alanis? here ya go!,"as far as scores go, i find this one above average. the best track without a doubt is alanis' ""still"". she managed to make a great cameo in the movie for all 5 minutes she was in it, and this song is amazing. she reassures the humans that despite all of their shortcomings, she loves them still, from the perspective of the almighty herself. the song is one of alanis' best ever. she manages to make this soundtrack worth the money to purchase, go for it it you love alanis, if you don't i would definitely suggest passing on this one."
4,"Good, but too many memories","This is a really good book, and I reccomend it to anybody who's ever been an outcast. It might be better if it wasn't 50% flashbacks, and you could almost call it a memoir, but I liked it a lot, and that's why I rate this book a four."
2,A Valiant Effort That Falls Short,"Ms. McCullough is a gifted writer who is not afraid to explore different genres. Here, she posits a United States facing a 21st Century Ice Age (when she wrote it global cooling, not global warming was in vogue). As futurism, that is one heck of an intriguing premise. But the tale falls short. She posits a new Messiah (whose surname is the rather trite ""Christian"") and, as his protagonist, a witch of a government bureaucrat who ""makes"" the poor chump into an international icon. The story plods along until its rather predictable ending. Well, not every work can be a masterpiece, and it is unfortunate that this one didn't make it because it sure had potential.This being said, I would make a great movie!"
4,Don't read this book in Winter!,"A frighteningly possible view of the not-so-distant future. A book you will want to read more than once, it may change your attitude about our wasteful society, politics and the future of our world"
4,Heartbreaking and heart-lifting.,"I always know I've really enjoyed a book when I don't want it to end, as is the case with this book. I still want to know more about Annie's childhood and what happens to her as an adult. Ms. Ziegler's writing style is very real--she describes the tragedy and comedy of human nature in a down-to-Earth way. My very favorite story is about Annie's quest to become a Girl Scout. I laughed but also felt her pain. I hope Ms. Ziegler comes out with another book soon. I'll volunteer to be one of the first to read it. Thanks for taking me back to my own childhood."
5,Great for beginners!!!,Very clear instructions on beginning massage. My husband & I gave each our massage table for Christmas and we now alternate every weekend giving each other massages!! Wonderfully relaxing and a great way to connect after a hectic week. The menu is great in that you can go to any one body part to practice. We have since taken a 'Couples Massage' class at our local college and gotten even more tips on massage. Would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in learning about giving massages!!
3,"Interesting, but not informative or fascinating.","Some good footage and anecdotes, but most of the commentary is extremely vague. I found too much emphasis was placed on repetetive interviews that merely state opinions held by the jazz world in general, and not enough footage was devoted to music. Some songs performed in their entirety would have been much preferred. Especially the call and response with Danny Richmond, which, although short, is almost reason enough to buy the video"
4,An American Icon or Iconoclast?,"Charles Mingus, one of the most creative forces in American 20th Century music, is examined in depth through archive footage and interviews with two former wives and numerous former bandmates. The music of Charles Mingus goes beyond simple categorization. Schooled in classical music, with his early professional exposure in the Los Angeles swing scene, Mingus moved through numerous styles, working with the major innovaters, such as Duke Ellington, Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Eric Dolphy. A volatile personality, his gentle and extreme sides are both in view. My favorite scenes are of Mingus' responses to stupid questions. By the end of this film, even those people who do not appreciate jazz will agree to Charles Mingus' place as one of the finest composers & musicians in American history."
4,Early Alberta Metis History,"This book is a potpourri of interviews and other contributions depicting Metis family life and culture. There is extensive material about the St. Albert Settlement and its people. This is where the author, Dr. Anderson grew up. There is also information on the origins of the Iroquois people in Alberta and the communities of Lac St. Anne and Fishing Lake. The content is woven around and interspersed with family stories. Elders reminiscences short vignettes, and family geneologies are accompanied by photographs of people, places, and activities. The author, Dr. Anne Anderson is a recipient of the Order of Canada."
5,A Gathering of Gargoyles (The Darkangel Trilogy),The whole trilogy is amazing! I'm so thrilled that I stumbled upon this series. You are immersed into a new world that still has enough familiar lore to make you comfortable to savor the journey. The characters are intricate and come alive in the pages. I loved the books and despite it being a trilogy desperately hope for more to come!
4,Surprise! I'm Alive!,"Returning from the dead, will surely confuse anyone. Funny, intesting, and charming."
5,one of my favorite old movies,"james garner and doris day,and the rest of the cast did a tredemous job in this movie,it is so funny, love watching it. d ball"
5,One of my favorite movies!,"I have yet to see ""My Favorite Wife,"" but either way, if you are looking for a very good laugh, I would highly recommend this movie. The scene when Doris Day pummels James Garner with her purse is absolutely priceless! And that judge is really a piece of work, being so pompous and gruff in his unique style. Oh, and don't forget that hilarious car wash scene! I could go on and on, but if you want a movie that is both hilarious and touching, this is definitely it!"
2,"Good start, one or two interesting characters, but a very stupid ending","In October 2009, the NYC LGBT Center book group met to discuss this book.Almost everyone thought that the plot approached magnificence, with all the correct characters and plot points in place, but instead of being great, the novel was clunky. The opening exposition was bald and bland. Most of the characters were missing something. And the ending really really sucked. The most sympathetic character was Elena, the Russian wife (via Paris and Berlin) who was full of poetry and showed, that even though she knew what was going on, she was trapped in a drama that could never end well for her. There were some interesting ideas about painting and being an outsider and love in marriage and sex (and sexlessness) both in and outside of marriage. But it wound up being unclear because the ending refused to answer questions about the outcome of the characters. The lack of an ending was a major problem for most of us."
4,Chucky!,"For those who like horror movies, 2 and 3 is the best. However, when the 4th series came out, the feel changed. I would recommend this for anyone who like the Chucky series."
4,Kick ass,"It's so funny reading reviews from little kids who've watched these movies in 2000 and 2001 for the first time. I'm 21, so I was a kid when the first ""Child's Play"" came out in 1988! I LOVE Child's Play 2. It's my favorite of the set. Part 3 I thought sucked. I remember a scene when Chucky steps out and says the equivalent of ""Boo"" and the victim makes this HUGE scene like he's been shot and dies of his own accord. Dumb. Bride of Chucky is just funny as hell, so I have to give it a good review. Overall, I'd love to have it, so thumbs up on this set!"
1,"4 stars, are you kidding me?","I can't believe this movie has 4 stars let alone people actually seriously giving it 5 stars. This set of movies is probably the most terrible series you can buy. It starts at number 2 and closes the series but they left out the only one worthy of about 3 stars. Ever since the first it went downhill from a mediocre horror movie right into the slums of just ghastly horrible movies. Disapointing, don't buy these movies if your life depends on it, they're terrible and so are the actors in them. Just look at the first one, the mom is the mom of the kids in that show 7th Heaven, give me a break."
5,Are You Scared...........Yet ?,"Well if not you sure as helk will be when your done watching this ""happy little story"" of a close with family with many values and morals such as: Speak no evil hear no evil or your done (yea thats not a good thing). This is truely a master piece in the horror field its definetly my sisters 28 F and my 14 M favorite horror movie. You will not belive your eyes at what goes on inside this house. As the title says ""In every neighborhood there is one house that the adults whisper about and the children across the street to avoid."" Well you sure... found it :)Scared ? I thought so"
3,good entertainment,"""The People Under The Stairs"" is purely good entertainment and you must treat it as so. If you rate it as you would ""The Seventh Seal"" then you would give it one star and say skip but for what it is, it is worth watching for a good laugh and a few hours of entertainment, if that is what you like. It's just got so much to offer: a 13 year old boy who turns hardcore (holding a shotgun and swearing by the end of the film), a David Byrne look-alike who is a racist Christian that randomly dresses in a sex slave leather outfit (like the gimp in ""Pulp Fiction"") and calls himself Roach, and it even has a political message at the end akin to Marvin Gaye's social commentary in his album ""What's Going On."" So how could you not want to watch this film? Invite some friends over, have a few beers, and watch ""The People Under The Stairs"" for some entertainment and fun."
4,one of the better Wes Craven films,I thought this movie was pretty good...very gruesome...I liked the Dog and the wacked out mom/lady in the movie...I recommend People under The Stairs to anyone who has not yet seen it...an underrated Craven classic !
5,A Very Exciting Movie,I love the people Under The Stairs. Roach is my favorite character hes very cute and sweet. I just wish i could find a book based on the movie. i do hope they make a second one too. would love to see a version of the movie that is made from the people under the stairs and roach's point of view and that shows exactly how they got their bad parts taken away.
2,It's no Citizen Kane,"I found this film accidentially on Amazon and was curious because I know Welles didn't complete a great deal of films. His directorial flourishes are definitely evident, but it is hard to really enjoy the film do to the quality of the transfer. The picture is dark and the audio is exceptionally bad. It looks like there were some budgetary issues in the making of the film so I couldn't tell whether this was a bad DVD presentation of a mediocre film, or an awful movie put on DVD badly. I did not shell out of the Criterion edition, which might give a better glimpse into the qualities of the film."
1,Unconqured People,"I felt all the songs on this album sounded the same. Not very Rootsy, I was knid of disappointed. I really enjoy listening to Israel Vibes but would not recommend this one."
1,Careful buying this one ...,"We just bought this and it is very distorted. A search of the web reveals that Arista is using some kind of copy protection that is causing a lot of home CD players problems. Posters are advising to look for one that has the ""Compact Disc Digital Audio"" logo if you want one that you can be sure will work with your player."
4,A truly amazing CD....Can't wait for her next one!,"I absolutely love this CD! I liked Dido's first album, ""No Angel,"" but this one is even better and is even more addictive. Her songs, ""White Flag"" and ""Don't Leave Home"" are great but all of her songs are good because they are all unique and different enough from one another. Her soothing voice makes all her songs peaceful and calming while incorporating melancholy undertones at the same time. This is definitely a CD worth buying!"
5,One of The Best,I first heard about the CD while watching The Sharon Osbourne Show.I had never heard of Dido.She sand a few cuts and I was hooked.This is a great CD.I understand that this is the number one CD in Europe and the top ten in The US. I look foward to more of her music.
4,Life for Rent CD,"I really am enjoying this CD Life for Rent. The title song ""White Flag"" I believe was written by the artist and is my favorite song. Honest lyrics and a full rich voice."
4,Truly beautiful.,"I bought this for ""White Flag"" and got sucked in by the rest of it. This album feels much more trip-hoppy than ""No Angel"", which to me had a more acoustic feel (even if it wasn't).My favourite tracks are ""White Flag,"" the title track, ""Sand in My Shoes"" (almost a club beat on this one!), and ""See the Sun"". Everything else is solid as well, though - ""Who Makes You Feel"" is the only one that drives me nuts (that sample!). These songs are meant for calm, and Dido's lyrical voice definitely doesn't hurt. Great writing music. :) Overall an extremely solid effort."
3,Dido's symphony...,"I have liked Dido, eversince she released the single from the album ""No Angel"" which was ""Thank You"" and ""Hunter"". After then, I watched her mature and become famous. Later on, she followed up with a worthy offering called ""Life For Rent"". The first single was a smash! ""White Flag"". This song has it all, a great melody, fantastic lyrics topped over with Dido's youthful, unique, and angelic voice. The singer is gorgeous as well but It's that voice that got me hooked all over! She is no Tina Arena or Celine Dion, but her voice has a distinct sound that cannot be compared to those high pitched divas."
2,Trip-hop for 40-somethings,"Its so sad that an artist like Dido, mildly pleasant but ultimately bland and MOR, has to be the mainstream reprasentative of what was the greatest musical movement of the 90s (and, yes, I haven't forgotten grunge). Portishead, Massive Attack, Faithless and DJ Shadow blaze the way for intelligent dance music, chilled, slowed hip-hop and that kind of mood music, and then Dido, assisted by brother Rollo from Faithless makes the formula a housewive's favourite by combining it with bland ""adult pop"" and safe, flavourless arrangements. OK, so No Angel was a nice enough album, but Life For Rent just stretches the point. Why does this kind of thing have to clog up the charts rather than some new, original music pushing through?"
4,Far from a masterpiece but oh-so enjoyable,"Dido may be one of the only artists making pop music which I can say I truly enjoy.Technically, she's no great singer, but there is an incredibly appealing quality to her voice that almost melts into the music, shaping and shading in the words into song.Every song is sweet, and ethearal, and relaxing."
4,"She is no ""one hit wonder""",I knew that Dido was here to stay and here is my proof! No Angel is still one of the albums I listen to often and Life For Rent will surely follow in the same footsteps. Her voice is divine and her music so pure...like a secret water fall in the woods.
1,One Good Song Does Not A CD Make,"The only good song on this CD is ""White Flag"". The rest of the songs are unpleasant to say the least and not what I expected from Dido. Her vocals are anemic and at times almost impossible to hear even when the volumn is turned up. I tried listening to the CD more than once in hopes that it would grow on me but instead it became more annoying and I put the CD in my charity pile to give away."
1,So Sad,"I tried to listen to this CD once, but all the songs sounded the same, and it was all just sad and whiny. So whiny. Do yourself a favor and checkout ""No Angel""."
3,Not her best attempt.,"I agree with people who said that this album is a good one.True, her voice has yet to disappoint, and the lyrics are a notch or two above mediocre... but honestly, this is one of those CDs i bought solely from listening to one song. i must say, it gets quite a few scratches because I skip so many tracks.I much prefer her first one, but its not a total loss.If I could, I wouldn't buy it."
4,B-sides from No Angel?,"Missing the lushness of No Angel in some ways. Many songs are bare and remind me of B-sides that are good, but missing an intensity. Mary's In India bothers me in this way. The pitter-patter drum electronic beat is annoying to me on this track. I do not care for See You When You're 40. My favorite tracks are: White Flag, Don't Leave Home, Who Makes You Feel, Sand In My Shoes, Do You Have A Little Time, & See The Sun. Don't expect another No Angel. This is different, more mellow, intelligently written, somewhat predictable if you know No Angel well, and unfortunately less goosebump inducing. Dido's voice is less exciting this time around."
4,Stoned,"I've known who Dido was for awhile (yes, from Marshal M) but I never bought a CD of hers because I mainly listen to electronica or techno if you will. I heard a mix of her song ""Stoned"" and fell in love with it, so much in fact that I got Life for Rent just to see if maybe it wasn't just a fluke song. I was pleased to learn that it wasn't and in fact ""Life for Rent"" has now crept it's way up on my playlist. I would compare it to a downtempo/ambient/chillout album which is good because all the songs have the same kinda flow. Now I'm not saying they all sound alike, no I'm just saying it feels like your listening to an album rather than 11 disjointed songs.-My one gripe is that she sounds SO depressed, like the love of her life committed suicide/cheated on her/beat her, all at the same time. Now I'm no stranger to the world of heartache due to love but you'd think she could at least include some non-depressing lyrics (if cheery one's are out of the question). Still, a great album all-in-all."
4,Good second effort,"I am, overall, impressed with ""Life For Rent."" I was expecting to give the album 5 stars, but I find myself just a bit disappointed with the album. I can't quite explain what it is; all I know is something is missing. I think the stripped down music is a bit of a jolt when compared to ""No Angel."" Nonetheless, I am pleased with the CD. Standout tracks for me are ""White Flag,"" ""See You When You're 40,"" ""Who Makes You Feel,"" and ""See the Sun."" I am not too impressed with ""Sand in My Shoes""--sung too quickly for my taste. ""Do You Have a Little Time"" is MUCH better live, although it is nice here. Actually Dido live is better than any album.She should seriously consider a live album. She is a much better live performer than studio artist. The songs transform into something much more beautiful and haunting when she is on stage. Oh, the album!! I recommend it---you won't be disappointed :0)"
2,my fault,"I was very dissappointed with Life for Rent.I purchased Life for Rent hoping that it would be another No Angel but willing to accept a more dancier album. With recent singles such as 'One Step Too Far' and Rollo working on the project I incorrectly assumed that the music would be driving.Nothing wrong with her music, I was more dissappointed because it wasn't what I thought it would be. Now I have a CD I opened and can't return. I doubt I will ever listen to it again.On a side note, I hope some of Europe's leading DJ/Producers get her in the studio because her voice is perfect for a dance remix. Not the soulful housey kind, but the dark techno type."
1,What a disappointment!,I give it one star for one good song! What a disappointment from her last albume.
5,Great book for hikkers,"I just started hiking this year and so i wanted a guide that would help me.This is the one i chose. It gave me exact directions, difficulty level, hike conditions, best season to go , whether fees are applied, whether kids or dogs can be taken, what to see, what all to take along, time for a round trip, how many miles to walk etc.I think that was the sufficient information for us. We have taken many of them and had a wonderful time in seattle.Give it a try, its a good reference book."
2,Good thing Sarah Palin changed my vote.,"I always held John McCain in high regards. He even had my vote until he chose Sarah Palin as his running mate. Then I decided once more not to waste my vote since neither McCain's Vice President nor Barrack Obama felt right for the highest office in the land. After seeing this Bio, I think I might have changed my mind sooner. There were alot of things presented in this bio that I did not know McCain had previously done. People can call him a war hero all they want. But he is little better than John Carrey. If I had seen this video sooner, it would not have changed my vote (considering I did not vote) bet it would have my mind up faster."
3,Well....,"I watch this to make myself an opinion as I am an ""undecided"" voter.Definitely, John McCain should be regarded as war hero. No doubt about that.I am not so sure about is political capabilities. The president of the United States cannot be elected based on sympathy and what he endured in Vietnam.Watching this documentary, I cannot see what change he can make to the US.A legend for the US army, but not presidential material."
4,An Excellent Book on the History of the Bauhaus!,Mister Whitford thoroughly chronicled the events that formed and shaped the Bauhaus - from the very beginning to the unfortunate end. A very good point of view - a must read for the Bauhaus enthusiast.
2,OVER AGE JENNIFER,"...Hemingway would have nothing to do with this adaption from his novel but the main criticism levied at Selznick is his wife at 38 was too old to play a young British nurse in Italy during WW1 opposite Rock Hudson as the American male nurse.The landscape and battle scenes were good but he was not being realistic casting his wife in this role.Selznick was still lookong for a sequel to ""Gone with the Wind"" which he had previously just failed with in ""Duel in the Sun"", but this film drags and the birth scene despite edits, remains too long.So much of the plot seems to have been truncated and reduced to a mere orthodox love story so there is not enough in the plot to sustain the time it runs.Incidentally the year ""1932"" that hangs as a title above is incorrect.This filmed version was made in 1957.I believe the Gary Cooper version was made in 1932 and in B&W not in colour as here."
4,I liked it.,"Just finished this book, took two days, hard to put down. Honesty and sincerity come across pretty strong and he is more than open about his shortcomings. It covered the period I was interested in, till about 2000, so more has been done since then but it probably followed the same pattern already spelled out in the book. I was disappointed that he didn't cover more about the music and the artists he worked with in his orchestra, I know there are several that have interesting backgrounds but the book mostly stayed on himself his philosophy, feelings and business dealings. Guess he figured those people could write there own book but for someone with such a high musical IQ I was interested to see what he thought of their talents and or lack of."
3,"""Heres looking at you kid...""","I thought this was a good movie. You have to watch it in one sitting. If you like old movies that have a good plot , then youll like this movie."
2,Muted story,"In Deadeye Dick, the underlying messages shine through Vonnegut's words, the morals of innocence, the corruption of being etc. etc.But Vonnegut forgot one thing in this book. The story. What is in his other books a perfect mixture of story and the underlying morals, here it is a decidedly lop-sided affair. The story is very unengaging and I found it quite tedious, to be frank. And unfortunately, it went downhill after an ok-ish start. Thankfully, those recipes he throws in very frequently at the first part of the novel are toned down because what was a good idea would have turned into an annoying one if continued too frequently.This is the most disappointing Vonnegut book I've read so far."
2,don't bother,"As much as I love Kurt Vonnegut, I failed to be moved by this book. It lacks the energy needed to hold the plot together, and it was only a vague curiosity and feeling of obligation which kept me from abandoning it halfway through. Hardcore Vonnegut fans may appreciate it regardless, but for anyone else I would recommend The Sirens of Titan (my personal favorite) or one of Vonnegut's many other wonderful novels."
5,"SCARY, AND BASED ON A TRUE STORY!","Like The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror, this is based on actual events and let me tell you, it is VER SCARY! Despite the hammy ending, this film is solid gold and is a REAL ZOMBIE FLICK! Wes Craven does it again! I hope his new movie They will be even better than this and his masterpiece Nightmare on Elm Street. This is a must see for horror buffs that like scares and not gore! Also check out another fact based horror movie like The Entity, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Possessed. WATCH IT ALONE IN THE DARK!"
1,Piece of Crap,"There were no reviews on this and I took a chance because I want to have something on my steering wheel for anti theft purposes. This product is flimsy , very light, very awkward and just feels like a total piece of garbage.If you want a crappy steering wheel lock then I would say buy this. If not, spend a little more and buy the club. I did't buy the club because they didn't have any good deals and did not want to pay 80$ so I paid 30$ and got two of these.I guess it gives the impression of a locking safety device, but I really feel that it could be broken. I peeled the sticker off so the name of it does not show.I think this company should stick to making electronics."
3,Mask of Command,"A reasonable book that looks at commanders over time, but perhaps more accurately the changing nature of command over time.I felt that first three personalities (Alexander, Duke of Wellington and Grant) were better analsyed and presented than the fourth (Hitler)."
2,Unlike anything else I've seen - Worth Reading,"Truly a unique book. Written by a large, loosely-knit group of recovering drug addicts in the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship, from around the USA in the 70's & 80's. It's hard not to relate to the stories in the book, even for those who never had a drug problem... If you think you might have a drug problem (or any addiction) - get it, read it, and decide for yourself. I live according to the book, and I've stayed clean for 6 years and my life has improved dramatically..."
5,Lessons,It is true that they teach lessons...that always teach the child that the parent is telling the child not to do something for there is things that will happen either good or bad...that they are only trying too protect the child...teaches them about loving others that arent of the same race or culture....among other things....I think they are wonderful and my now 9 year old loves them...her granmother always gets her them when they come out...
5,Awesome deals!!,"My son wanted the whole set of The Land Before Time ever since he got back from his friend's house. Due to the high total price, my wife and I didn't want to spend that kind of money all at once. Untill this 9 movies collecion come alone + free shipping from Amazon.ca. It becames almost irresistible for us not to buy it.I've seen the volume X only, but already know the reset of 9 will be great too!! I highly recommend this collections for anyone who hasn't got them yet."
5,My favorite movie.,"I havent expected this low budget indie to be a fantastic movie either. Yes, there are certain themes that remind us of famous movies. Yet, ""Interstae 60"" has a plot of its own, with excellent actors, witty lines and issues ranging from love to sex to drugs to mother-son/father-son relationships. The movie cleverly pokes fun at lawyers' practices; America's war on extasy and drugs and the long hand of the law. It talks about life, love, destiny, freedom of actions, being true to self, to others and to the society that you live in. This is undoubtedly my favorite movie and I recommend to everybody if not to buy it, to at least rent it and watch it with a group of friends."
3,Great Actors do save a movie~,"I do think this movie is a bit too childish and naive in many sense. It's a good escape though - escape from the harsh reality. Yet everything seems to be too easy in the plot. The answer which the protagonist is seeking, is too obvious to be found. This is fatal to the movie since I can't share the feeling with him. In another words this movie actually fails to move me.But yet, life is always too serious to cope with. Therefore I do have a happy time with this movie and the supporting cast-- they really bring glamour to this relatively plain story.With a special attachment to this kind of story and the great support cast, I give 3 stars... though actually it worth perhaps only 2 and a half only."
5,DVD Movie,"I love this movie. It is fantasy, comedy and drama. It is one of those movies with a philosophical message about life and people."
4,Cool,"NEver heard of it until it was on cable tv a couple of years ago. I never forgot it, now I just bought it. Very, very cool.RELAX, DON'T DO IT!!"
1,not so good,"It was recomended, but couldn't watch the whole thing. Notso interesting for me, wrong generation, maybe good for the younger generation."
1,PURE SCAM!!!,If you want to throw away your money I highly recommend buying this DVD.This is a completely trashy production-the total length of the film is only 26 wasted minutes-not the 40 minute length mentioned on the back.I guess the producer did not have a working watch!!!
1,A Tribute to Brainwashing and Propaganda,"The reviews reproduced here are a tribute to Tom Barbash, just as Barbash wrote the book as a tribute -- and an exhoneration -- to his college buddy Howard Lutnick. Therein lies the tale. Barbash and Lutnick have artfully exploited the suffering of others -- one to write a book (and to promote a novel), the other to strike an innocent pose. It worked! Look at the reviews that blindly defend the book and charge that any criticism of it is tantamount to insensitivity toward the victims of 9/11!This is wonderful propaganda indeed, and if I were to grade it on that scale the book would get five stars. Lutnick's obsession with looking good and Barbash's equally atrocious commitment to whitewashing exploits grief as it turns anger onto others. Sickening."
5,Sobering,"A good friend of mine worked at Cantor Fitzgerald and was among those lost on September 11th. I read this book in one sitting - I couldn't put it down. The devastation that this event caused to the people of Cantor Fitzgerald who lost so many of their family members and friends is astonishing. 955 children who lost parents, twenty sets of siblings who perished. I found that I wanted to be part of the team of people that tried to rebuild the company and help the families of those who were lost.I'll never look back on September 11th the same."
4,Great Shoes,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
4,Chucks are Always awesome,Chucks are always awesome and this one came in an awesome condition! My only qualm about this line of converse is that it provides no support as do most converse.
4,Chucks,These shoes are light and comfortable to walk around in all day. Thier sizing is a little confusing. These run about one size larger than most shoes. I recommend using extra or replacement insoles.
5,Excelente,Producto de muy buena calidad 100% buenoProducto de muy buena calidad 100% buenoProducto de muy buena calidad 100% buenoProducto de muy buena calidad 100% buenoProducto de muy buena calidad 100% buenoProducto de muy buena calidad 100% buenoProducto de muy buena calidad 100% bueno
2,$$$$$$$ Vietnam,"I have worn these things since high school and the quality was much better when they were made in the USA. The glue doesnt seem to hold up as well and the canvas is not as tough. I don't know if it is inflation or what, but why are these shoes 50 bucks? The whole reason they were great back in the day, was they were half the cost of the other shoes and twice as comfortable."
4,They are what they are,"A shoe that barely qualifies as such, which is what I wanted by the way. This is one of the best shoes for drumming I've ever worn. They're light, comfortable, the soles are so thin you can really feel the pedals, yet they're thick enough to give you protection. Anyone who's ever drummed in bare feet will know what I'm talking about. They almost feel like slippers and more importantly look cool especially if you're wearing a black leather jacket, blue jeans, t-shirt and your name is ""something"" Ramone."
4,Style over comfort,I absolutely love the style of Chucks but my one piece of advise is to wear thicker socks if you want comfort.
5,"Great shoe, customer service, well.......","I ordered these shoes for a wedding, yeah I know, and paid the extra twenty bucks to have them shipped 2day air. They went from the East coast to the Midwest, and were five miles from my house on Friday, but UPS charges extra to deliver on Saturday. If I had known there would be an extra charge, I would have paid it, but wasn't given the option. The shoes arrived on Monday, the day after the wedding. I emailed the company to voice my displeasure, and was informed that I actually received them before I was supposed to! My advice, great shoes, great prices, just make sure you plan ahead."
5,My favourite kind of shoes,"What can I say?I love this shoe,there awesome.They made me feel like I was walking on air everytime,I really want another pair of this great shoes.I love them so much,I might just buy 2 pairs lol."
2,Wrong product,"The shoes came really fast but they were not the ones that I ordered. I ordered the black and white chucks and when I opened the box, they were completely black. There was not enough time to call and complain to get the correct ones."
3,Great shoes.... If they send you the right ones.,"I carefully went over all the details before I ordered this pair of shoes. Hi tops - check. Size 7.5 - check. White - check. Chuck Taylor - check. Everything seemed excellent. That is, until I opened the box (which arrived just on schedule by the way). By some mistake I had received a pair of very nice looking low tops. Which would have been perfect if that was what I'd ordered. Now, the shoes have been sent back, and a new pair is on its way."
2,very good runner,"I have gotten these runners for my sons for over 10 years. They love the colors, light feeling, and comfort of these Converse shoes. They are also not ""ones for leather"" so these fit their tastes perfectly and they are washable. I would not recommend them for gymnastics or physical education classes because they are not made for that type of activity but they are comfortable for walking!"
4,Served it purpose,"Bought this for daughter for pirate night on Disney Cruise. It held up without issue and fit well. It's a halloween costume, so it's not made to last, and the price was in range for what I was willing to spend for her to wear it a couple of times. Happy overall."
1,"great movie, horrible edition on a DVD-R","This is a great movie and the second version of this I have bought on DVD. I was mislead on the ""remastered"" part of the description. The video quality is worse than any version I have seen broadcast. This edition is a DVD-R. It looks as bad as a third generation VHS tape. I have the Ovation one as well, and the video quality is pretty poor, but it is MUCH better than this, and cost much less as well. I have thrown this one in the trash. What a waste of $14.95.TCM showed a vastly better version that I caught a few minutes into the movie, so better quality versions exist."
1,The Stranger - Disappointing Blu-ray Quality,"My rating is not for the movie (which I like very much *****), but for the lack of HD quality. Although I was very much looking forward to watching this movie in the upgraded Blu-ray format, I was extremely disappointed in the picture quality. This Blu-ray version is extremely soft and overly bright, and lacks HD image depth throughout. Bottom line - because there is no noticeable upgrade in picture quality, if you already own MGM's 2007 release on DVD there is no need to purchase this Blu-ray version. Let's hope Citizen Kane & Magnificent Ambersons Blu-ray releases will be better!"
4,Minor Classic From a Master Filmmaker,"A noir-ish thriller directed by and starring Orson Welles post-""Citizen Kane"". Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young co-star. Shares a neat clock-oriented subtext with ""The Third Man"". The character Welles plays, a Nazi baddie named Franz Kindler, who has established a new life for himself under a new name in ""Harper"" (neé Hartford), Connecticut is only a step or two removed from the nefarious Harry Lime of Carol Reed's classic. That was the film in which Welles gave the great speech -- one of the film world's best -- about Switzerland and the cuckoo clock. ""The Stranger"" isn't quite as clever, but it's a fine film nonetheless. Somewhat reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated ""Shadow of a Doubt"", in which Joseph Cotten played an urban killer hiding from the authorities in the deceptive safety and security of the suburbs. ""The Stranger"" isn't based on Albert Camus' novel; that was made into a film a few decades later by Italian director, Luchino Visconti."
4,Welles and Hitchcock-Share and Share Alike,"While not Welles best, ""The Stranger"" is entertaining and has a great look. What is most interesting is the crossover between Welles and Hitchcock as much of both story and style are borrowed from ""Sabotage"". Hitchcock would later borrow original elements from ""The Stranger"" for use in ""Vertigo"" - so apparently the two directors came out even.The nontechnical highlights of this film are the performances of Edward G. Robinson and Loretta Young. Young is especially amazing, she plays Sylvia Sidney's role from ""Sabotage"" and is literally and figuratively the star-with more lines and screen time than Welles. Also entertaining is drug store owner ""Mr. Potter"" played by Billy House; who is always ready for a game of checkers which he plays wearing an eye shade while shamelessly cheating.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
5,gift appreciated,"Bought it as a gift for someone ,they appreciated it. They haven't got the chance to read it yet. What can I say."
2,Disappointing,"After I had read Jules Archer's book about Smedley Butler, I couldn't wait to learn more about the man. However I was 80 pages into this book and I realized I hadn't read anything of substance, nothing that made me interested in Gen. Butler. The book is extremely dry and the author uses sophisticated phrases that left me bewildered as to what I was reading. Gen. Butler was a great man who deserves much better than this. If you want to learn about Smedley Butler, read Jules Archer's book; because it offers much more than this book."
3,Academic study,Author takes a fascinating story and dries it out into a less-than-stimulating biography. General Butler deserves better than this
3,I bought 5 copies,"This is definitely the herpetological bible for anyone interested in reptiles and amphibs in kansas. I recommend it to anyone. I gave it as christmas gifts to people that are always telling tall tales of snakes and giant snappers they see. As far as the current common and scientific names go, hey its science, which is constantly changing and Joseph T. Collins is at the forefront of wildlife research in kansas. It truly is a shame he cant print a new book every year, but unless youre audobon, who really can."
3,Good but could be better,"Generally good pictures and up-to-date information, but writing is stilted and uninteresting.Book claims to use currently acceptable standardized names, but there is still much debate about such names. In fact, a new list of standardized names will soon be published that will make obsolete a number of names used in this book."
5,A Most Satisfying Fall,"Juliane and Ulrich really are legends in their time. She has the dubious honor of being the Queen of the Frigid and he has the sole distinction of being the King of Seduction. As the story unfolds, we learn how very much Juliane stands to both gain and lose if a man manages to rise to her particular challenge. Ulrich could easily have been a one-dimensional character in this story, but Dain peels back his layers and we find out how very much he has to offer Juliane.The most surprising thing about this book is its intense emotional depth. I expected a fun read and a great one, since it was by Claudia Dain. I should have expected the intensity and the heart-wrenching revelations, as well, but they somehow took me unaware. This book, like its hero and heroine, has many layers. It is deep, moving and satisfies on so many levels."
1,Not a book to fall inlove with,"I got two of Dane's books as gifts and this one is better than ""Temptation"" which was unbelievably bad, but this wasn't too much better. Gives a good feel for the period but I want love in my romance books, and there just wasn't any here. Rape is not the least bit tittilating, nor is having the couple consummate their marriage in front of an audience. The reader is left feeling like a voyeur. A big disappointment. Read Loraine Heathe or Fern Michaels instead."
5,BEST SINGLE CD FROM A GREAT SOPRANO,"In the 1960s these recordings were only available on two LP vinyl records at a cost of $20 each, used. Sena Jurinac was little known in the USA, and it is good to have the recordings on CD digitally restored. In 1953 when these recordings were made Jurinac had not yet started to sing heavy roles which took a toll on her voice. Her dramatic ambitions and abilities had a tendency to exceed her vocal stamina. Here everything is wonderful. Her ability to let the text guide every phrase is almost unique. I dare say no finer recordings of these works are available. The mono sound is clear airy and clean."
3,Can you sue your parents for malpractice?,"A catchy title, that's why I started reading it. The book is okay. Not the best book I've ever read, but not bad either. I think teenagers can really identify with the main character Lauren. She describes her life, her family life, her problems, etc. There are funny parts, but it's also sad sometimes. It's a good book for a teacher to read in class with pupils. There are many items you can talk about, like what happened to Lauren re. sex. Her boyfriend broke up with her because she didn't want to go all the way with him. Or about her family life; her parents quarrel a lot. Her father is very old-fashioned. Teenagers have to deal with these issues. What do they feel, or think and do? So, even when I think it's not the best book, I still think it's worth reading it."
5,Fantastic DVD Audio Mix,"I have to say that the surround mix of this album is absolutely phenomenal. I was only able to listen on DVD-Audio not the DTS-ES mix because I have a 5.1 system, not a 6.1. In any case, the separation of instruments is exceptional. Forget about the metal head below - I don't think he even knew what he was reviewing. If you like MMW, and have a DVD Audio player, buy this disc."
2,ok read but very predictable,"Right from the beginning of the book you can figure out who is friend or foe... The stranger J.T., who also of course has to be the love interest, is weak. In his past is a tragedy that basically ruins his life for 3 years. He just can't get over it. Jodi the other main character is out to save this reclusive stranger even though her uptight boyfriend the mayor doesn't like it. Then add the uptight boyfriends primadonna sister and you have the making for a predictable story. If you have to read this book don't buy it check it out at the library."
3,What Happened to Sharp Quality?,I do not have this particular microwave; though I do have a Sharp 1100 Carousel and feel compelled to comment. Originally I had another Sharp model. After about six mos. the door would not close properly. With a little shoving you could get it to operate but I found that a bit alarming. Walmart (where we puchased) let us exchange it for the above model. After less than a year a couple of the keypad numbers do not function - I have to choose another number. It's such a shame that what you thought was a quality product you could depend on is no longer.
4,very good product,"I'm happy with the microwave so far (had it for 2 month). The installation is very difficult for a single person but, as the saying goes, if you are having less of a problem then the men of Apollo 13 then you have no problem.The turntable is very useful, the dials are easy to understand and over all 950W are the power you'll need. The fan is strong and has more suction then an intern in the White House. Overall I'm happy."
4,Dated but still fun,"Full screen but most movies are from this era, it was a humerous look at reincarnation that I don't remember seeing. I recently attended a play by the same name and wanted to watch this movie version. I enjoyed it but many of the situations were definitely dated."
2,Goodbye Charlie,I'm sorry but I did not like this movie. It had some flaws. Theactors were good but the story was not told very well. I wouldn't recomend this movie.
4,Back Surface Mirror Glass,"This is a good quality mirror glass, especially for the price.Most replacement mirror glass manufacturers build front surface mirrors (mounts with the plated side out). This is a back surface mirror (mounts with the glass out), meaning the plated surface is protected from scratches by the glass. This means the mirror glass won't need to be replaced a year or two down the road due to normal wear-and-tear damaging the plating.The product came in OEM packaging, consisting of a plain box, padded bag, and plastic bag, making it essentially ready to mount. This is much preferred over display packaging, which includes the mirror attached to a piece of cardboard via double-sided adhesive. The adhesive is difficult to clean off; I ended up discarding a different mirror because I damaged it while trying to remove glue, so the OEM packaging of this mirror glass was much appreciated.I find this product to be higher quality than the equivalent (front surface) mirror glass from Dorman."
2,VERY MEDIOCRE HORROR MOVIE,"A MAN [ISAIAH WASHINGTON] BEFRIENDS A PACK OF KILLER RATS. AFTER HIS BROTHER IS KILLED, HE USES THE RATS TO GO ON A KILLING SPREE. THE TALENT THAT THIS FILM HAS IS BASICALLY WASTED. THE PLOT IS JUST STUPID AND THE MOVIE IS JUST BORING AT TIMES. ICE-T BREATHES SOME MUCH-NEEDED LIFE INTO THIS MOVIE AS A RENT COLLECTOR. THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE IS THAT WELL, IT'S JUST BORING. THOUGH THIS IS MEDIOCRE, I HAVE SEEN MUCH WORSE HORROR MOVIES ABOUT KILLER RATS THAN THIS. YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH A RENTAL ON THIS ONE. DON'T BUY THIS."
3,WEIRD,"Why did I order this? I don't know. Still, it wasn't too much of a waste of an hour and a half. Do I recommend it? I don't know. If you want to take a chance. Go 'head."
4,Buy it now!,"Three movies directed by Orson Welles: ""The Stranger"", ""The Trial"" and ""Mr. Arkadin"". The best of them is ""Arkadin"" (aka ""Confidential Report""), probably the best of Orson's films after ""Kane"". However, this is the worse version, too short and with few flashbacks but, even so, we can see the genius of Welles in every shot of the picture. The collection also includes introductions by Tony Curtis and the original trailers for Orson's ""Touch of Evil"" and ""Citizen Kane"", and Richard Fleischer's ""Compulsion""."
5,ANNE IS THE BEST,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this Anne Murray CD. She is such a classy and understated performer. I have never belonged to a fan club in my life, but I would be willing to join hers. I've had fun introducing my children to her music - while cleaning on Saturday mornings. :)"
4,"Anne Murray's best love songs, but be careful...","Because they will stick in your head. These are my favorites of her lovesongs, although my wife thinks they are about sad situations. If you know Anne Murray, you will recognize these favorites. Buy this along with The Best of Anne Murray, so far."
1,Look elsewhere,"I used this dvd once and will probably never use it again. It had a lot of lunge work, almost through the whole video. There was hardly any ab work, which is why I bought this dvd in the first place. It used weights, which was great but you repeated the same 4 steps through a song and then again 4 new steps through the song. It focused a lot on balancing and not a lot on pilates."
3,Kind of boring...,I really liked the workout but the whole time I was thinking about how boring it was and repetitive.
2,Recommend for Beginners,"I've been working out at home, with various workout videos, since I had my daughter, 6 years ago. I have never done Pilates before and after reading the other reviews, I had high hopes. I was sorely disappointed after one workout with this video. After completing it, I felt like I hadn't worked out at all.Maybe this video would be better for someone who is a beginner, but definitely not intermediate or advanced."
4,Somewhat hard to follow,"I ordered this DVD from Crunch Fitness because I was looking for new DVD's to work out to. This is somewhat kind of hard to follow and with all of the different DVD's that I have from Crunch, this is not my favorite. I do love the instructor Ellen but I'm not crazy about the DVD. Maybe it's in part because I'm not a big pilates fan!"
4,Best for Beginners,"The Joy of Knitting is well-written and interesting, but repetitive if you have read Elizabeth Zimmerman's books or The Social History of Knitting. Many of the techniques are clearly EZ's (i-cord, for example) but not as clearly credited to her.For the beginning knitter, this would be one of the best possible books you could choose, providing a mix of history, technique, and inspiration.If you have a shelf full of books, or have knitted for decades, this might not be your best choice.Either way, I wish her lovely shop were in my neighborhood!"
1,Not very practical or helpful,"Very poor instructions, and then when I tried to find more information on the internet I found conflicting information. The instructions say to start with the small end, but on a transcript from ""Oprah"" it says to start with the big end. Not very practical either, you're supposed to do Kegels many times a day and you can't exactly use this when you're sitting at a stoplight or at your desk. Not worth buying."
1,No Good,Very little directions of how to use it. I got most information from the reviews on Amazon. Difficult and akward to use. I would not recommend it . I put it in the trash can.
2,"LOVE TOSH, but I thought it would be more","I am a huge fan of Tosh.o. I usually start my day with an episode so I head out to the world in a good frame of mind from laughing at his antics with the internet. But I was hoping this would be more of his stand up comedy, I guess I should have read the description further.I love his DVD's of his standup. But with Amazon it is so simple to stream every season to my Roku player, so I have every episode already uploaded and streamed to watch at my leisure. I hope more people take advantage of Amazon's Video on Demand and streaming Tosh. He is hilarous and no topic seems taboo. Even after watching every episode several times, I find myself laughing again and again. As a social worker myself, some of these topics others may find offensive, but even with my profession I find him hilarious. But please, more stand up releases, these on his DVD Hoodies are already easily found in the On Demand section"
4,"Bold, stark realism","An intensely thought provoking, well researched analysis that boldly highlights the imperial elements of the U.S.A."
4,Patience with the lid.,"This is a great salad spinner, just be gentle and patient with the lid as it needs to line up properly for a good fit."
1,Maybe Mine Was Defective,If mine was not defective it should be considered so. The lid would not lock securely in place and the darn thing would wobble about. Also the basket would wobble inside and touch the walls of the container while trying to spin. What a disaster.
2,not sure it works,"I was strictly pumping for my little one, so it was important to keep my supply up. I used fenugreek and mother's milk tea. I'm not sure it really worked. I thought maybe it was increasing my supply, but I think it might have been in my head. I do know that it made me smell like maple syrup big time. I also have suspicion that it was making my baby fussy, which I have read can be a side effect in other reviews. I think it might have upset his stomach because when we switched him to formula, he was much better, and that shouldn't be the case with breast milk. I know it wasn't what I was eating because I was quite careful to eat mild foods. So, I don't think I would recommend this product."
1,Not as good as other brands,"I started taking fenugreek several months ago because of supply issues and noticed an immediate difference. However, several weeks ago, my supply started decreasing again. I had been taking three pills, three times a day. I started taking four pills at time, then five. Still no increase. While discussing it with a friend, I realized that the decrease started about the time that I changed brands. I went back to my old brand, and my supply immediately increased again. I'm not sure if the bottle I had was just old (the expiration date is 2014, so I don't think it is) or if this was just a bad batch or what. All I know is I won't be buying this brand again."
2,"Boy, was I disappointed","I'm not usually so out of sync with the majority of reviews. I found that setting this story in the future didn't add much. The sex scenes made me laugh, definitely an unusual reaction! The protagonist is not sympathetic; the only way I know she's so great is the other characters keep saying it's so. The way Eve and Roark always know what the other is thinking, and know the right thing to say and do for each other is a bit unrealistic. The plot itself was rather obvious. The book is much longer than it needs to be. I got really tired of hearing that Eve wanted to hit someone every other page or so. The whole book was rather silly, a disappointment and a waste of time. Sorry to say."
5,A Favorite!,"This is one of those rare series that just keeps getting better and better. Just when you think you couldn't love Eve, Peabody or Roarke anymore you are proved wrong by the next installment. I loved every minute of this read and think it is one of my favorites so far in the series!"
5,Wonderful. Just wonderful.,"I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but the interaction between Eve and Roarke just keeps getting better. I actually found myself resenting those little things, like sleep and food, that took me away from the book. Now all we need in the next book is a romance for Peabody..."
5,Eve Dallas does it one more time,Once again Eve tracks down the sadistic bad guy. Ms Robb has a superior talent. I am glad she decided to share this talent with the rest of the world. I hope she continues in this matter.
3,As the series continues,"Initially, I enjoyed the series, but after the 4th or 5th book they started reading like assembly line stories. (Deadline is near, better crank out another story.) I was hoping that Eve's feminine characteristics would develop once she didn't have to be so tough and on her own."
2,Big Disappointment,"I am a big fan of these producers' previous movies (Beckham, Bride and Prejudice). It's nice to see actors from the prior movies in new roles, but the film falls flat. The concept is silly but could have been saved by dynamic writing and direction. Unfortunately, the execution is bland, the writing weak (Poor Ash wandering around talking to spices, which works the first few times, but not beyond), and there is absolutely no chemistry between the main romantic leads. Dylan McDermott is miscast, his role is poorly conceived, and he needs a shave. The creators of the film seem to have said: what aout this? what about this? what about adding that to explain that? But they never came up with a good package. One is painfully aware that one is watching a bad film."
2,Disconnect,"I tried watching this with my 8-year-old. We both grew weary of the emotional disconnect between the characters and the violence - as though killing was simply something else they had to do and it really didn't have any emotional impact on them. If that is the message of the series, it is lost in the relentless mayhem. The animation is great, but the series is unmoving."
4,The Kids Enjoy,"Grandpa sits and watches with the kids (Upteen times) and they seem to always enjoy, even giving me names of the characters I can't seem to remember. My three y/o grandson can give me dialog before being spoken. We're into season three repeats."
5,continuation of the Star Wars Saga,It is a great companion to Clone Wars one - my husband is extatic that the comic bookis attached and reads along with thr episodesI was great high dramawe all acually enjoyed it soo much
5,STAR WARS CLONE WARS LIVES ON!!!!,"George Lucas , Dave Filoni and company have done it again with this highly recommended second season of Star Wars The Clone Wars. With characters like Pre Vizsla, Aurra Sing, Bossk and a young Boba Fett showing up to cause trouble for our heroes, it makes for excellent entertainment. I have been an avid fan of Star Wars since the first movie and it is great to share this experience all over again with my two daughters. I would not hesitate to recommend this series to anyone. And to see it in Blu-Ray is only an added bonus!"
5,Why aren't there any characters available?,"My daughter loved this movie (along with the other 9) and all she wanted for Christmas was a ""Littlefoot"". As big a money making machine as this series has been, why on earth aren't any of the characters available for purchase (stuffed, plastic, or otherwise)? Granted, it is annyoing that the characters don't evolve, but the movies fulfill the purpose they were created for and occasionally throw in a moral lesson along the way. The creators just need to take the next logical step to making more $ for themselves and more children happy."
1,Another piece o crap,If you notice almost all the movies are about that annoying pacifist littlefoot or the longnecks [these names are dumb]and now we are on the 10th fricking movie and I hear there are 13 I hope they stopped there because these are getting worse
2,No Moms Allowed,"Very good lessons on friendship and diversity. However, none of the dinosaur children has a mother. Only father figures and grandparents are depicted in the parenting role. The main theme of this episode is the accidental finding of Littlefoot's father. However, no mention of the little dinosaur's mother is ever made. A very disappointing DVD from a family values perspective. Would not recommend for people who value motherhood, since it is completely ignored."
3,This movie is not too bad,"I am pretty neutral about this movie. Strangely enough, it is the only movie that is appropriate for very young children yet provokes violence and hateful reviews from some teenagers. So what do you rate a movie that is not OK for adults? You must be under 13 to watch this movie. CG -13?visit [...] and order a duct tape purse. I hear it is all the rage.sike this movie is gay. period."
5,Excellant investment for adapter,"Wanted convenience to travel and have found its perfect to leave on my counter for everyday use. Cord wraps perfectly around for small carry space. I will purchase another for my kids room for his Nintendo, phone, etc with limited receptacles. Carried it to Europe. Bought one European adapter and plugged this in for all our charging needs."
3,Not a surge protector,"The small size of this power strip is very handy, but what I didn't realize when I ordered it is that it is not a surge protector. Now it's not much use to me because I won't use my laptop without a surge protector."
5,Perfect for travel,"I bought this for my trip to South Africa. It was great to be able to use one adapter and have a power strip so we could charge our camera batteries, cell phone and net book at the same time. This power strip allowed me to only purchase one adapter. I also noted that of the three hotels we stayed in, only the Westin had multiple outlets available for an adapter. It was much easier to charge all out electronics at once and not have to wake up in the middle of the night and change chargers. This item impressed my travel partner, who has over 2 million air miles, so that is an endorsement from a road warrior."
4,Almost perfect...,"This product is almost perfect. What would have made it five stars would be a longer cord. The 14"" cord is a bit to short. Otherwise I love it! I travel a great deal and it is a life saver in hotel rooms that are poorly designed for electrical access."
5,Does what it needs to,We bought this to take on our trip to Europe so we could just use one power converter. This little power strip was just what we needed. Plus it's small and compact which makes it easy to pack when you're trying to pack light. It did exactly what we needed it to.
4,excellent for business travel,"This is a great little accessory for travelers. There is great space between the outlets so I can use them all at once with multiple differnt types of AC plugs. The only downside is the blue LED light on the wall plug where it says ""Monster Power"". If you put it in the right location, it would be a useful night light. However, it is a glaring light and very disruptive to sleep if you put it within eyesight such as plugged into the lampstand common in many hotel rooms. I find myself propping some type of notepad or other opaque material in front of the plug to block the light."
3,"Tough, inflexible","I would have appreciated either a longer cable or alternate prong orientation to allow for different directions of outlet splitting. Otherwise, the basic mechanics are tough and resilient and work well."
3,Pretty good!!,I love the power strip until I use it for my hair dryer. It always blows it's curcuit when I use the dryer on high. Otherwise it is great.
3,Not as fun as I anticipated!,"The little stacrobats do not stand up as easily as thought. They tip over very easily, making it hard for kids to build. And because this product was alot of money for what it is...unfortunately wasn't worth it. =("
5,Funky with the emphasis on FUN!,"I've got to admit that I purchased these links because I loved the way they looked. They have a sleek, funky style with amazingly vibrant colors that spoke to me...fortunately, my daughter (3mo at the time) thought they were pretty neat as well. They work well as car toys and teethers with several different textures on which to gnaw. My daughter still plays with them (18mo), whether it be by linking the shapes or kissing the plushies! Overall, I think their novelty has been worth the price since toy longevity is rare in our household."
4,crochet,"very nice book, with a lot of different items, many assembled from smaller patches. i absolutely love the runner with the peacocks on the front"
4,Crochet Designs,"Book was very good at showing the patterns and how to make the patterns, but was little dissapointed that some of the older crochet patterns were not in the book at all."
3,I was hoping for less talking and more action.,"C.H.U.D. reminded me a lot of BREEDERS except that C.H.U.D. didn't suck it long and suck it hard like BREEDERS. The idea of radioactive waste turning homeless people into slimy monsters is great but 32 minutes doesn't need to go by before we even see a C.H.U.D. in action.After the long build up the C.H.U.D.'s finally do get busy and funky and start chasing people with gusto (whatever that means...I heard it on ""Futurama""). One even chases some poor broad around her apartment in the best scene of the movie.Interesting for one viewing, but there's too much time devoted to police work and city politics and not enough C.H.U.D.ding going on.Look for a young John Goodman as the ill-fated cop in the diner massacre scene...the massacre was off-camera by the way."
4,Great Film,"C.H.U.D was a great film with over the top notch notch acting. Great affects for a 1984 movie, and great creatures.....but, this film seemed to be missing something. I don't quite know what it is that it's missing. Maybe the plot wasn't right. It just didn't feel like a 5 star movie. It is a great film and you should check into it and see for yourself. John Heard and Daniel Stern (Home Alone actors) are great in this filma and make it enjoyable. The music is pretty good and the creatures in this are awsome for a 1984 movie and are still quite good. I recommend renting it first before you buy it just to make sure you don't feel the thing that's missing in this film. I'm still deciding weather to buy it or not."
2,A real stinker...,"I like craptastic movies as much as the next guy, but this was a turd pure and simple. They barely show the ""Dwellers"" throughout the movie. It's a pantheon of actors who were braking there way in at the time. I give it two stars because I hear the commentary is supposed to be really funny, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. If you want to feel like a fool, buy this movie, otherwise netflix baby!"
1,Steven Seagal is to Martial Arts what Millie Vanillie was to Music,"The only reason I gave this movie a star was because there is no Zero star option. Where does Seagal continue to get backing for his movies - the last 8 (or 10?) have all been awful. His last good release was Under Seige. I only wish my 401K grew as fast as his waistline. Submeged is bad - no suprise there, it will be the last movie of his I watch, I just can't take it any more. Submerged? Must be a reference to his movie career which went under about a decade ago."
2,Ultimately Dissatisfied,"Although I have not seen all of Steven's movies, I have seen most, and this is the worst, of the most, I've seen. There is too much shooting and betrayals, non stop, from begining to end. It was too hard to keep on top of the plots and scenarios, and it seemed that the only ones loyal to each other was Cody's (Steven's) team. And Steven was completely out of character, at several different points in the movie, I think someone was voicing over Steven, especially when he had to say bad words, most of Steven's movies he rarely swears, but this movie is full of swearing, even by him, and alot of times it didn't sound like Steven's voice. The movie has lots of action, and if you want to see Steven out of his usual character, lots of betraying, killing galore and if you think you can keep up with the non stop 'betraying scenarios' then this movie is probably for you."
1,Utter disgrace,"I can imagine that one could sell himself out for the money, everybody does so these days, but it is blatantly obvious that money is the only thing Seagal cares about. He doesn't really care what crap you end up when you buy this DVD, as long as money end up in his pockets. However, as 7th Dan Shihan that has thousands of Aikido practiotioners all over the world looking up to him, it appears that he has no shame as well. Forget about all that bs about inner self, japan, martial arts etc, this guy sold his soul to the devil. Vinnie Jones playing bad ass guy and acting on top of that? Yeah righ, my grandma doing pottery scene with Patrick Swayze would look more convincing. What have you learned in Japan Steven for all those years?"
1,Very bad....,"I don't understand why the producers of this movie chose Uruguay to make it look like a terrorist country. I am from Uruguay and the information shown in the movie is totally wrong.And some people say: "" but it's not a documentary, this is all fiction""...I know it's not a documentary, but I would like to ask these people... would you like they use the Flag of your country to show your people as terrorists..?I think this is about RESPECT for other countries . The producers of this movie are insulting my country and it seems like an anti-tourism campaign instead of a movie."
1,Don't do it!,"This is not the Seagal of the early nineties. Something has happened to him and it's not good. He's gained weight, does not move like before, and is hard to understand. The technical process is terrible. I will never buy another Seagal (I have 14 of the old ones) again and I think Amazon should seriously consider taking this off their site."
4,The Cat Who Went into the Closet,"Another enjoyable book in the Cat Who series...Euphonia Gage is a rich old lady, but unexpectantly commits suicide in her later years. Her family is suspicious there is foul play involved especially when she recently changed her will to leave everything to the retirement trailer complex where she lives in Florida. Koko is able to help Qwilleran solve the mystery by literally pulling the pieces out of the old lady's closet."
5,A Great Mystery Book for All Ages,"This was a great book. In fact at first I thought it would be kind of stupid but once I started reading it I didn't want to stop, which was good because I was on a deadline. I have always liked myteries, and i have already read all of the Nacy Drew books and they are starting to get old. I think I would recommend this book to people who like mysteries, because if you don't you proably will be really bored."
4,GET YO LAFF ON,"wHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS ANIMATED VIDEO, I WAS DOUBTFUL BUT ONCE i ACTUALLY SAW IT I WAS LAFFING HYSTERICALLY.THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN AT ALL. MAD PROPS TO BERNIE MACK TRUE TO FORM WITH HIS COMEDY ROUTINES.TRUE IT'S A BIT STEREOTYPICAL, BUT SO WHAT KICK BACK AND ENJOY. EVERYONE THAT HAS WATCHED HAS ENJOYED IT."
2,Bad acting gets in the way of a few good surfing shots.,"I say 2 stars for the surfing footage, but unfortunately there's not enough of it to make the video worth buying. Your time is better spent surfing on a bad day."
2,Not worth getting,This is just another gimmick item. It is one of those things you use a couple of times and then wonder why you bought it. I couldn't tell that it was working as stated. You are better off just doing crunches in my opinion.
1,sad,"this plastic box , It was name a vhs tape the prior owners to hold a movie? It's the very wores or I hope the wores that I will ever see! In most of the reviews I'm short too the point to say thank's, But to leave the web site to play the tape this time not the case. I wil be short only by , NO THANK'S"
1,Tortuous,"I would rather read a calculus text book.I will never forget _The Island of the Day Before_ because I will continue to periodically have nightmares about reading it.I'm in therapy now. The doctor says that in a few more years, I'll be as well-adjusted as I was before I read this...piece of literature."
2,Not his best work,It is a bit tedious to read. It reminds me a great deal of the first chapter in Turn of the Screw. You are getting the story 3rd hand.
3,This one cured me of any more Eco,"Okay. Finished another Eco book. Unsatisfied, again. Brilliant and beautiful writer that takes you in circle after circle after circle after circle until you arrive finally at - nowhere. I did not find it difficult to read as many reviewers have mentioned (except sometimes the broken and halting German/English that the Jesuit spoke) nor did I find problems in the translation from the original Italian. Eco writes masterfully. As I've mentioned in a previous Eco review, if you have hours upon hours to spend simply to be taken away into a world of words and ideas without any expectation of ""resolution"" then Eco is the writer for you. I understand ""The Name of the Rose"" is good but I can't imagine offering myself up to Eco again. I'd probably find more gain simply browsing a thesaurus as a thesaurus provides more ""closure"" to its tale. After 1,200 pages, I am cured of Eco."
3,not bad!,"The explaination of the title is incredable, Eco is one writer you cannot fall asleep after reading, hence it is best to start the day with a chapter. I am normally a slow reader but instead of considering it a bad point; I, in fact, treasure my good luck. I was lost in Eco's world for some time. READ IT"
2,Mediocre,"After reading ""The Name Of The Rose"" and ""Foucalt's Pendulum"" Imust say this is a mediocre book for Eco's standards, who isunable to maintain the interest of the reader as the storyunfolds.The reason for this is that as I advanced on the lecture Irealized that it took me to nowhere. The use of a lot ofhistorical facts (which I don't really know if they are true ornot) and the mention of ancient books aren't enough to createthat feeling of ""necessity"" to know what is going to happen next.After finishing it I had the sensation that the two last hundredpages were very similar to many Evangelion chapters in whichShinji Ikari tries to find the meaning of life.Evangelion is a japanese anime, and this review stands for thespanish version of the book."
2,One of the most disappointing books I have ever read.,"After reading The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, I could barely wait to get my hands on The Island of the Day Before. However, I was sadly disappointed. Having read other books by Eco, many of the philosophical meanderings contained in the text were not unexpected. But unlike his previous works, many of the long-winded descriptions of philosophy, scientific thought and theology in this text felt out of place. Rather than contributing to the plot, as they did in Eco's previous novels, they simply served to slow down the pace of the novel and leave the reader trying to remember what the book was about in the first place."
2,Eco fails - Not up to his other novels,"The tale is confused and bloated. The Island of the Day before comes across as self-indulgent and would have been better left in manuscript form.I am ardent fan of The Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum, yet if this had been my introduction to Eco I would never had read those books.This book is I am afraid to say uncaptivating and frankly boring."
2,"Too long and winding, needs some sound editing!","Gets worse with each page despite a promising beginning. Some interesting parts and literary effects, but even these get lost in this mess"
1,many recipes i would never ever use,"i was disappointed, many who i talked to recommended the Lorna Sass pressure cooking books. 90+% of the recipes were made with foods I would never consider eating. so for my family there may be 5 or 6 recipes that i would consider trying. if its made with foods they won't eat, then this cookbook was not meant for me. That's my opinion and i would guess that others find it very useful for them, but not for me."
3,"Good, but not his best","Having just read GKC's essays from 1929-1931, I noticed quite a difference in these earlier works. Here, his insights are not quite as penetrating, his humor not quite as sharp. Still, Chesterton on a bad day is better than most social/political/spiritual commentators on a good day.Recurrent themes/subjects in this volume include:1. The anti-democratic tendencies of England which arise in part from an immoral concentration of wealth among the ruling class.2. England's immoral and irrational laws against the poor, and England's treatment of the poor in general.3. Feminism and the Suffrage movement.Also of interest are a couple essays reflecting on the disaster of the Titanic.All in all, worth reading, but I found the volumes covering the years just before and during WWI far more interesting."
4,"I like this product, but the name is ...","I like this product, but the name is a little deceiving. It's more like a """"file"""" instead of a buffing product. It works great for shaping nails, but it leaves scratches on the surface of your nail if you try to use it to """"buff"""" your nails. Although it wasn't quite what I was expecting to get, it's a good product."
4,Great product. I have artificial nails and can't ...,Great product. I have artificial nails and can't always get to the nail salon on a regular basis. This buffing block helped me get through the in-between period. I was able to buff my nails to a really smooth finish and then polish them and they looked as great as they do when I walk out of the nail salon. The size of the block is perfect too. I'd highly recommend this to anyone.
4,Overall I'd say the Orly Buffing Block is ...,"Overall I'd say the Orly Buffing Block is a great find. I rarely wear nail polish but I do like a clear polish coat. During the time I have been using the buffing block I've noticed an extra shine almost like a silky sheen on my nails before I even apply my clear coat. Especially for the price, I feel this is a very good product."
2,The product sanded the ridges out of my ...,"The product sanded the ridges out of my nails. I didn't particularly like the shape. It made it harder to get to some parts of the nail. It was a little large. It didn't work any better or worse than any buffer I've ever used before. I was under the wrong impression of a buffer before I received it. I'd had a soft nail buffer, which made my nails shiny without sanding the ridges. This made my nails dull. Supposedly the polish goes on better with smooth nails. But the polish I applied didn't stay on any longer than normal. It was nice to have different sides, with different levels of roughness. But I wouldn't recommend this to friends and family. It didn't really impress me over any other nail buffer."
3,"SUSPENSEFUL, BUT VERY SLOW AT TIMES!","I have read all of Catherine Coulter's FBI Suspense thrillers (The Cove, The Maze, The Target, The Edge) so I decided to try one of her revised contemporary suspense novels. False Pretenses did not even come to the FBI thrillers. False Pretenses and Beyond Eden have a TON OF ROMANCE in it and not much suspense. Elizabeth Carleton is married to Timothy Carleton, a very rich man. He gets stabs with an ice pick and is killed. Elizabeth goes on trial for his murder but is proven innocent. Timothy's whole family is fighting a war to try and get Timothy's business and his money away from Elizabeth (the heir). This novel is mostly a family bickering session. Near the end of the novel Elizabeth trys to discover who killed Timothy, is it the mysterious person who testified on her behalf, her new lover, or a business associate? If you want SUSPENSE, try the novels I earlier mentioned. False Pretenses should just be classified as a romance novel."
4,Summer Read,"Catherine Coulter never fails to deliver. This is a good, summer read. Romance with some intrigue. Not the best intrigue I've ever read, but worth your time while sitting at the pool. I enjoyed it, overall.No Child Left Behind? The True Story of a Teacher's Quest"
5,Finally On DVD!,"This is a very well done ""Nutcracker"" put on by the Pacific Northwest Ballet in the early 1980's. Made into a movie by the Director Carroll Ballard, with choreography by Kent Stowell and an incredible set and costumes by Maurice Sendak, it is well worth the newly-released DVD-R to view. Excellent production! Great for adult and child, it is the original intent of the designers of the ""Nutcracker"" and not the watered-down versions now available. Fantastic displays of set and dance, with a soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles MacKerras make this the holiday film of choice."
3,Hard to read but packed with information,"There is a lot of information in this book, most of which is very interesting and potentially useful. So long as I think of this as a 'reference book' and not a manual or how-to, I'm happy with my purchase of it.The book's main problem is in presentation. It is a compilation of publication from other sources, primarily the US government. As such the quality of each section varies greatly in age, usability, and legibility. Really, this book should come with a magnifying glass as several sections have been reduced in size to accommodate the format and are made functionally illegible.In short, if you are looking for a book to tell you how to become 'Self-Reliant', this book isn't going to help you much. If you are approaching self-reliance and need a book to fill in some knowledge gaps, then it is a valuable resource"
2,Nothing new. Tiny print.,"There is nothing in this book that you can't find on the web for free. As a matter of fact it looks like some of the pages are actually photocopies of other sources. If you have an internet connection, save your money and just look up what you want to know online. Also, this book mostly uses a 10 point size font in most places which makes it hard to read."
1,Useless,"I couldn't even use this brush. It kept shedding bristles, even after several washes. My advice is don't even bother with it."
1,letterman complete hitsits,the sound tracks were poorly done and the resulting sound was distorted would not buy this type of cd again from the same producers. this is the first time in years of buying that we have gotten an unsatisfactory prodict
2,screen cracked on second day,"i have a briefcase iwth internal padding & have used it succesfully with my laptop now for 3 years. on my first use with the caselogice however my screen cracked badly. whatever others say, & it is certainly cheaper than many, this is not the best protection available by a long stretch."
1,Warning: Amazon has the product descriptions mixed up,"There are apparently two versions of Alex in Wonderland; the one listed here starring Debbie Allen, and the original 1970 movie starring Donald Sutherland.This listing is for the later Debbie Allen flick, but the description carry a synopsis of both movies (unfortunately). Also, the reviews are for the earlier film. The link to this earlier Sutherland film is here: (ok. I can't insert the link. Just search Amazon for ""alex in wonderland"" and you will find it."
2,"Largely known as ""One and a Half""","Paul Mazursky's classic film comedy ""Alex in Wonderland"" has a cult following that should have kept remembering the overall consensus of critics that in all its homage to Fellini the film should only muster the nickname, ""1-1/2."" It is not very entertaining to the point of being slow, occasionally funny and only sometimes insightful, it is more so merely pretentious. It has not aged well as I can understand why its reputation has grown through the years as it was not available, but it can now be seen and to watch it intoxicated as audiences probably were expected to in 1970 may dull the senses enough to find it to be more enjoyable than it really is."
2,"Casting Error, Big Mistake!","This is an utter failure as a romantic comedy. It is not romantic, nor is it a comedy. The fact that anyone would choose a sullen Matt Dillon over the obviously desirable Vincent D'Onofrio is not to be believed. It is only because of Vincent that I gave it 2 stars for the 6 or 8 minutes he appears in the movie and brings it to life. Vince is always excellent and compelling. He could have made something of the title role, but it was not to be. The audience's loss, I fear."
2,"Cute story, but Matt Dillon is all wrong for romantic lead","Matt Dillon was seriously mis-cast in this film. He came across as an unlikable, hopelessly plebian, crotch-scratching ""dese, dem, and doze"" low-class slob, while the lovely Annabella Sciorra seemed urbane, literate, and softly spoken. One wonders how these two ever got together in the first place. For people who supposedly grew up in the same neighborhood, the speech patterns are noticably at odds, with Dillon's character coming out at the bottom. The premise was predictable, the main character unlikeable, and the ending unbelievable. The supporting cast, however, was superb, considering what they were given to work with. Vincent D'Onofrio is wonderful as the shy pharmacist, Sciorra is a beautiful and engaging ex-wife to Dillon, and Mary Louise Parker comes across as a much better match for Dillon's character than Sciorra. If you want a good romantic movie, see Happy Accidents instead. Review refers to the VHS Tape edition"
2,Fabulous Felt Hats,"I would like to give this bookFabulous Felt Hats: Dazzling Designs from Handmade Felta high rating, the pictures of the hats are gorgeous. The problem with this book is that the layout is a major issue. You have to go back and forth to the beginning of the book and back to the instructions. More care should have been given for the plastic resist pattern. This book is not for a beginner but for someone with more advance skills. As a person with felting and millinery experience, I found this book difficult to follow."
4,Cheezy Fun !,"This would have been a three star rated picture but Billy Zane's VERY hunkish, VERY sexy and naturally aggressive presence hiked this one up a rating ;-) This wasn't one of the best horror flicks I've seen, * I give that title to the first Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream* but I loved the storyline, and Jada Pinkett makes the perfect heroine as she battles Zane's character,The Collector. After watching her agile movements in this movie, Low Down Dirty Shame, and Set it Off, I'm surprised that someone hasn't signed her to star in her own action flick."
5,Hilarious comedy & horror in one great flick!,"This movie is hilarious, even though you would normally categorize it as a horror flick. It has an amazing cast: Billy Zane, Jada Pinket (before she was Mrs. Will Smith), William Sadler.It starts off with a fun car chase, explosions, & slimy demons all within the first 20 minutes of the movie.Then you have the town drunk, the prostitue, the jerk that everyone hates, the psycho mailman, and Braker (Sadler) in a run-down hotel trying to escape demons & stop the end of the world.Zane is charming, funny & delightfully evil all in one as he tries to tempt the people trying to escape these demons that threaten Earth & the whole of the universe.If you're into unnecessary blood & gore (as I am lol) then you'll love this movie.Plus, it's Tales from the Crypt!! This movie is amazing.. and I love it!"
5,Demon Knight!!!,"Wow! What a good Movie! This is byfar the best Demon Possesion movie since the Evil Dead. The demons look a lot like pumkinhead, but with long rock band hair. William Saddler and Jada Pinkett lead the fight against the sly and funny collector (Billy Zane). The fun begins right away with a cool beginning action sequence. As The film goes on, introducing the charcters, the demons arrive and the war begins. I'd say the best parts of the movie is where you see the demons takeover people.It's really gross! They mutate and deform in different ways! But, if you like funny, actiony horror films that are explosive, This is It!!!"
2,Escencially bland,"Upon receiving this CD in the mail I was anxiously awaiting to hear this long awaited sequel to ""Fallen."" The first two tracks were good! ""Call Me If You're Sober"" is definitely one of the best from this band. Unfortunately, the tracks after it are not so good. ""Fallen"" had a very smooth flow to all of the tracks, yet each song had its own distinct sound. Not true with this CD. Tracks 3 through 13 sound all too much alike. It is about an hour of the same guitar riffs and Amy Lee's screeching. It wasn't long before I got a headache and had to take a break at track 10 or so. This glass-shattering CD lacked the cool theme and distinctness of their original album."
4,"Oh, did the song just end?","During the first spin, when I finally noticed I was on track 5, I literally said to myself ""Oh, I thought that was a damn long song.""The point is, there are some points in this album where the songs just blend together. Considering that 2/3 of the writing team is gone, the lyrics are quite ""simpler.""BUT, Evanescence haven't lost their kick-derriere musicality. It's just lyrically speaking that I'm whining about."
2,rip off.,"The opening riff of ""Even in Death"" is a direct rip-off of the riff in Rob Zombie's song on the Beavis and Butthead movie soundtrack (you know, the music to Beavis' trip in the desert). I don't mean it sounds kind of like it, I mean it IS it. Shame on you, Amy. Quit trying to sound like a cheap imitation of all the great female fronted bands from Europe and quit ripping other people off. If Evanescence is your introduction to this kind of music do yourself a favor and check out The Gathering, Within Temptation, After Forever, Beseech (incidentally, Evanescence's logo looks suspiciously similar to theirs), Amaran, Epica, Nightwish, Asrai, To-Mera, Theatre of Tragedy, Leaves' Eyes, Elis, Edenbridge, Drain STH, Collide, Tapping the Vein, Draconian, Stream of Passion, Ambeon, Ayreon... and that's just a start. Once you've heard all these bands I think you'll agree that Evanescence is only the tip of a much better iceberg."
4,"Good CD, Good price!","I bought this CD as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it! Although I was expecting the Digipack edition for the price, it was still reasonable AND came with free supersaver shipping. Would recommend to any fan; Good CD, Good Price!"
2,Can't hear Amy,"Fallen is IMO one of the best albums ever -- a rare one where I find all the tracks enjoyable. I'm still far from fully understanding why I don't like The Open Door nearly as much, but there's one thing I noticed, and that's that I have to strain to understand what Amy Lee is singing. This is probably a major part of it. In Fallen I could enjoy the words, and I could enjoy her voice. In The Open Door it's all somehow drowned, by either the music or the effects, or at times it just seems she's whispering. In Fallen her voice was also overlayed with stuff, but at least she seemed to make an effort to rise above it, or perhaps whoever edited it seemed to realise that her voice should be heard."
2,Disappointing,"I waited patiently for years and finally they put out a new album. I was a huge fan of these guys because i believed ""Fallen"" was a great album. When their guitarist left i thought it was a big deal because his lyrics and musical contribution itself was a big part of this band. But the guitarist of Cold, another fav band of mine, took his place. So i thought at least they found a good replacement. But when i heard the new single i was somewhat disappointed, it was okay but it still wasnt even as good as the worst song off of ""Fallen"". This new album is different from the last one and you can feel the emptiness in the music without the old guitarist. Even the new lyrics are somewhat repetitive. I thought about giving this album 1 star but at least it had 4 or 5 decent songs."
4,Coming of Age,"This is definitely a gamble on pop/goth hybrid Evanescence's part. Some of the songs attempt to explore different facets of the band's talents. They do an admirable job but fall short of Fallen's power. The recent shakeup of the band's roster is probably the reason for this new direction.If, however, you are one of Evanescence's die-hard fans, little will dissuade you from purchasing this album. But for the rest of us, you may want to sample a few singles, like Lithium, before making a commitment."
5,Amazing,"When I first listened to this album, I was disappointed. I wasn't expecting to like it because I'd heard bad things about it, and sure enough I thought it was boring and that without Ben Moody writing, Amy Lee had no idea what she was doing and was just putting random bits in all the songs that didn't really go together. After a couple of listens I realised I was totally wrong. Evanescence doesn't NEED Ben Moody, and Amy Lee knows EXACTLY what she's doing. The bits that I thought were random and didn't fit in actually fitted in perfectly. This album is a lot more mature, more complex, less poppy and more optimistic than Fallen, and Amy is sounding better than ever. Call Me When You're Sober is the LEAST good song on the album. you're an Evanescence fan you won't be disappointed, unless of course you're one of those teenyboppers who only liked them because you saw them on MTV."
4,Love it!,"Absolutely no complaints! However, it kept skipping all over the place when I tried to listen to it on my DVD player. Unusual. So, I bought a CD player."
2,Open Door - CD,"When I first bought this item, I selected to have it delivered to my house in 2 days (for a little extra charge). It didn't arrive in time for me to give it to my sister on her birthday. It came 7 days LATE!! What's worse, they still charged me the extra fee even though it didn't show up the day they said it would. Poor service, poor delivery. Very disappointed."
2,Okay,"This album is okay compared to Fallen. I really liked their songs which people I guess refer to as soft. I feel that the only hit they really have on this album is the sober song which has a lot of radio play now days. I would have given their Fallen album 5 stars. This one is just two, not that great."
2,Amy Lee Fans Only!!!,"It does not even come close to Fallen!! True, Amy Lee's voice is excellent, but the band itself is lost in the background. The music is so slow, lyrics good, but could use more fast music. I like only three songs on this CD and I am afraid I will not play it like Fallen. I wore out three copies of Fallen and to this day it is still one of my favorite cd's. True, Amy Lee is beautiful and so is her voice, but what happen to the music!!!!"
5,Love it more everyday!,The first time I listened to this CD it sounded all the same and did not inspire me as much as previous work from them. The more I listen to it the more I love this band. It sounds fantastic in my car and the bass really gets a good thump at high sound levels. Everything is top notch and I can't wait for them to come around or produce another CD. The added pictures and lyrics is a nice touch. Not many bands now put this much effort or talent into what they do.
2,A disappointment,"I loved Fallen. That was a great CD, still is. I'm not entirely sure why but I just didn't like The Open Door very much."
1,This Album REALLY stinks!,"I REALLY wish I had read the comments before purchasing.Having been a fan since ""Fallen"", I thought that maybeI would enjoy another great album. I love Amy Lee'svoice...Well this one was ""the WORST music I have everheard.""The loud ""Metalica like music"" is all you hear. You can nothear a word of what Amy Lee is saying in her lyrics.Every single song is just awful.I am SO disappointed."
1,"Sucks, only one GOOd song!!","Well I hate to say it, this CD stinks it feels like one long song.I had really high hopes for this CD, I tried liking it but couldn't.Hmm maybe next time they'll get it right.Try Papa Roach's ""The Paramour Sessions"", that's an amazing album.Peace!!"
2,"The worst in the series, but that still doesn't let it down","One of the most ridiculous plots I have ever seen, the way they resurrected Chucky was a complete joke. But if you just want to watch it as a horror movie and not worry about it's originality, it's great fun."
2,Childs Play 3,"More amusing than chuckies previous movies, but completely unscary. Andrew Robinson's SGNT Botnik was probably the best thing about the film."
2,Pretty lame entry in the series,"Child's Play 2 actually managed to live up to the original film, so it was no surprise that a year later Universal rolled out another Chucky movie with Child's Play 3. This time around, Andy (now played by Justin Whalin) is grown up and in military school, and of course Chucky is once again re-built, and soon tracks down Andy in hopes of revenge and transfering his soul. The doll effects and gore are nice, but the acting is beyond lame, the killings aren't as imaginitive, and the story is beyond predictable. Brad Dourif is on board again as the voice of Chucky, but even his menacing growl can't save this installment from mediocrity. Followed seven years later with the more imaginitive Bride of Chucky, and the recently released (and beyond bad) Seed of Chucky."
1,DIE CHUCKY DIE DIE!!!,"Viewed: 7/05Rate: 27/05: Oh, no. Another sequel of Child's Play. There is nothing new with Child's Play 3. It's just boring as hell, and the picture is stupid as bananas. All in all, there is nothing good to say about Child's Play 3, really."
3,Well...,"The first sequel to Child's Play was decent, but this one actually left a lot to be desired. Jump ahead about ten years or so, so that Andy is now a teenager/young man at a boot camp, and Chucky finds his way to Andy in yet another attempt to possess the body. There's some funny bits in this film, but overall, this film was considerably more cheesy, even with the gory scene that results from Chucky replacing paintballs in the guns with real bullets. If you watched the first two, go ahead and watch this one, you may enjoy it."
3,Weakest of the series but does have some moments!,"10 years after Chucky ( voiced by Brad Douriff) has been blown up, he has been brought back to life so he can kill and get to Andy Barclay whom is now 16 at a military academy. But when the chuckster finds another young boy whom is a student, he plans on taking over the kids soul and andy must stop him before it's too late.The weakest of the series but not without some redeming qualities such as gory special effects, some "" Full Metal Jacket"" in-jokes, and Chucky getting his face sliced off to look like Pizza without cheese.The DVD is definitely sharp looking in picture and sound quality with no extras at all, it's definitely an alright entry in the Chucky saga."
4,CHILD'S PLAY 3,"Chucky the killer doll is back once again in CHILD'S PLAY 3! After being rebuilt by the Play Pals Toy Company, Chucky once again resumes his search for Andy Barclay, the boy Chucky wants to transfer his soul into. It turns out that Andy is now a teenager attending military school, and Chucky is going to show him what war is all about!"
3,Hmm....,This thing is OK. It's certainly NOT the best Delerium single I have ever heard (that honor belongs to Silence). The only mixes that I really like are the Lost Witness ones.Let's just say that this CD doesn't come out of my CD case very often.
3,U.S. Marine Corps boot camp,"The video does a good job of documenting Marine Corps boot camp but does not do as good a job as ""The Crucible"". Recommended for those interested in Marine Corps recruit training. The video only covers enlisted boot camp; those interested in Officer Candidate School will have to seek that insight elsewhere."
1,"Terrible Accessory, terrible service",I agree with the previous reviewer. It causes Windows XP to shut down. Magellan was absolutely no help in solving the problem. I called on the phone several times and wrote emails several times. They don't seem to be able to communicate in English very well. I was trying to use the product with a SporTrak Color.
5,The best Rock and Roll collection ever!!,"Never in my life have I ever experienced such a great collection of vintage Rock and Roll hits! The quality of the songs are fantastic, and the famous artists featured are monumental. All the true rockers are a part of the soundtrack. Even the howling, prowling Wolfman Jack is a part of both C.D.'s. Every single song is a rocking, wonderful hit, and you're sure to love it. I certainly do. - Peter A."
5,Great products. Greater Company!,"I ordered an adult catcher mask, which arrived very quickly and was well packed. The mask was of great quality, I loved it!"
4,Used like new Drift Cutter Kit,Item came as described brand new condition. Cuts down drift edge so snow stays off engine. I could have bought angle iron and stove bolts and nuts for a lot less. I paid more to have powder coated cutting blades. Even if I paid more now. I feel in the long run it will pay off by not having to replace rusting out angle iron every few years. And no sharp edges to worry about.
4,Great Setting & Concept,"What could be more fun than a female secret service agent and a hair-raising adventure? I figured out one plot secret in the first 50 pages, but I still enjoyed myself. If this book had been edited better, it could have been great. If you can get by a few unplausible events, you're in for some good entertainment."
4,Fast-paced thriller,"This was a pretty fast-paced and enjoyable thriller. The actions were believable, the main character likeable and the story was good. What more can you ask for? (Refers to the abridged audiotape version of this book.)"
2,one of the saddest days of my life,"let me start off by saying that i was very much looking forward to this, a lot. i loved everything FATA have done, that's why i'm so upset with this album. i listened to it once and almost threw it away, literally, then i gave it a second listen and found some songs tolerable. this isn't a horrible album, some people will likely enjoy it more, but not old fans. they took everything that made them good and threw it away likely at an attempt to go mainstream. hope it works for them but i also hope they release another album very soon and come to their senses and make some real hardcore as they previously have.with this album FATA pretty much does what every other band that changes do... add a poppy sound and alternate the singing and screaming (which is very toned down).some standout tracks:vicious cockfightplacentapedeshort for showjack and gingerand abandon you friends (title track) is quite catchy... after a few listens, same with placentapede"
4,Abandon Your Friends,"On their latest album, Abandon Your Friends, FATA strays some from their traditional sound. It is much better live than on the album, but it is still well worth buying. Also worth checking out is Biology where Francis MarK (the back-up singer/drummer for From Autumn to Ashes) is the lead singer. They rock!"
4,Impressive,"Julie wants to keep her job. Mitch wants to turn her sex toy shop into a restaurant. She decides to demonstrate the products on her sexy boss to convince him to keep the store open. Neither of them reckoned on the results! Julie Sheldon first appeared in ""It's a Guy Thing"" which I plan on looking for!This book was a very fun read with loveable characters! Set in Boulder, CO Ms. Myers used the town to her advantage. I live in Denver so was able to visualize her setting easily.My only complaint was that I wanted to see more or less of the secondary characters. :-) I kept getting involved with them as well.I will be looking for more of Ms. Myers' books!"
1,Crude Tool,1. Not a very well made machine.2. Trying to add all of the options is impossible.3. The expander cannot be bolted into the machine.4. The drill bits are poor quality and difficult to install and use.5. The handle to pull the drill bit into the material is hard to pull. No touch at all using the handle.6. The machine came all greasy and was difficult to wipedown. It was a mess.7. It was easier to setup my drill press and use than using this machine.
1,Terrrible,"cheap pot metal cast aluminum body, the retention bolt for the depth stop failed within 2 days of light residential use. Power switch burned out with a year. Tension pins that hold the handle to the crank gears failed after two years worth of light use.Terrible Terrible Terrible."
2,What a piece of junk,"Gas return spring does not have enough pressure to lift the motor head.Hold down is bent.Back fence is warped and their is no way to get it square.Handles to tighten adjustments (3 of 4) broke with very little pressure.Delta support was useless as they considered every problem a result of abuse.The provided chisels require extreme caution to use.This mortiser is not capable of anything deeper than 1/4"" without predrilling.The only good thing I can say about the unit is the base was flat, the motor has sufficient power, and all the tools for adjustment are provided.For large or deep mortises, I'm sticking with mortise chisels."
4,Same Old UPS Issues,"The box arrived mostly intact. When I opened it though I could see the styrofoam had taken a beating. The machine appeared to be undamaged so i completed the simple assembly and tested the machine. The following day I noticed a crack in the base of the Column. I will see if Delta will just ship a replacement column.One other issue is the mortise depth with the smaller chisels. It seems that with a 1/4"" bit (only one tested), due to the length, a mortise cannot be cut to a depth of more than 1"" off the base. So in 2"" stock you would be able to go no more than 1"" deep. This is an issue with stock that may be 6/4, or for through-mortises. I guess a nice square, parallel backing block between the workpiece and the base would take care of the problem. Since the instruction mention through-mortises I assume they are possible with the larger chisels."
2,Not shippable by UPS or FedEx,"Since I am 2 for 2 on recieving broken units I would not recomend purchasing unless shipped byt truck. Fedex and UPS both damaged units. The packaging for the unit is not suitable for this type of shipment.Thanks,"
4,Good start for a needed modification to work properly,"This machine is good to buy as a starting point but as is the fence is way too small to support reasonable sized workpieces. So, buy it, bolt a steel plate about 6 x 12 to the fence, about 1/4"" thick, and enjoy. Works fine otherwise."
1,Damaged item,"Mortising machine received by UPS, box completely crushed. Machine had large, serious crack through frame and I had to return it. Amazon was very good to replace it. But it was a lot of hassle. See review of new machine when received."
2,Disappointed,"The first one had a problem with the base. The holes for the tower, fence slots, and chisel/drill thru-hole were all machined off center. I returned it and the replacement had the same problem ... only a little less and in different places. You can actually see the problem by eye.I will say that the support folks and sales rep were very helpful. I was told that the DELTA people are going to do spot checks on the production line."
3,All over the place............,"O.K., I admit I am no dancer, but this video is very confusing. Now, I have ""Sweating to the Oldies"" 1-3,""Disco sweat"", Sweat & Shout"", but this one will not be one of my favorites. By the time I figured out what he was doing, he was on to something else. Richard never does cue much but he was just too hyper for me in this one. Too many ""thin, beautiful"" people too. Sorry Richard, I luv ya, but this one is not your best."
5,Loved This Book!!,I could hardly put this book down unless I absolutely had to. Casey is a great character and so determined. I wanted her to catch Leonardo. It seemed impossible so I had no idea if and how she was going to do it. I had alot of sympathy for her and what she was going through. I have read all of this author's books and I think this is my favorite. Well written and a lot of suspense.
5,Faint of Heart Beware,"Savage Art is not for the faint of heart. Cruel, vivid physical torture is the main thrust of this book and the author's precise descriptions transport you into the same room, same location, and even into the body of the victim. In some instances you will put the book down for not wanting to read more while in the next instance, you'll be picking it right back up and turning the next page. A suspense novel does not appropriately define this work. A combination classification of horror/thriller/suspense would be more appropriate."
5,Buy it... Now!,"Their best album, amazing. (Forever My Lady is a fairly close second, and their 3rd album a very distant third) If any of the first 6 (all ballads) tracks came out as singles today they'd all (still) be hits, that's how well this album has aged. The second, faster half, some will pass on. It's not bad stuff at all, but you really have to be in the mood for it, it's very very dark and bassy. Interestingly, Timbaland, Missy Elliott and Playa all can trace their roots back to this album, so it's no wonder it's great. I ought to only give it four stars, I don't think this album is *perfect* but I like the first half so much I gave it an extra star. Like some of the other people who reviewed this album, I wanted ""Lately"" to be on here, but it's probably a more consistant album without it so I don't mind."
5,Love Jodeci,"Jodeci has always been one of my favorite bands. Diary of A Mad Band is one of my favorite albums. They always deliver great music that is soulful, genuine and packed full of romance! As their sophmore follow up to Forever My Lady, which is the best by far,they certainly do not disappoint. My favorite tracks are the slow songs, Feenin, My Heart Belongs To You, and What About Us which are perfect romantic mood setters! The fast tracts are bold and flirtatous yet fun. KC and Jojo's vocals are passionate and heartfelt in every track. Jodeci has delivered some of the best R&B love songs of all time! Part of the reason I Love Jodeci and this album!"
3,Good construction saw,"When I making furniture, this was one of my first purchases. I used it for several years until my skills improved to the point where I began to need a more accurate and repeatable saw. This saw has plenty of accuracy for construction or general use, but falls short for projects requiring a very good fit.As a previous reviewer mentioned, dust collection was marginal with only a portion of the dust collected in the supplied bag. In fairness, without a vacuum attached I don't think any miter saw would be much better.This saw did see fairly heavy use for about 3 years and stood up well and was still working when I replaced it."
5,DELTA DUST COLLECTOR,"THIS IS THE FIRST DUST COLLECTOR I HAVE OWNED. I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND SELECTED THIS UNIT BASED ON PRICE,AIR FLOW AND REVIEWS WRITTEN BY OTHER BUYERS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND FOR THE HOME SHOP BUYER"
2,Loud and unstable,If it wasn't for the really low price on this I would be very upset with the purchase. It's my first Delta tool and has left me disappointed. It is much louder than the other reviews indicate. Forget talking to anyone while it's on (in a small shop at least). It is also very top heavy and is extremely easy to tip. Hit one expansion joint in the concrete and down she goes. I'm trying to figure out a way to put it in the attic and run hoses because otherwise I can't see myself using this dust collector.
1,This tool doesn't collect dust,"Save your money, it's useless. Even fine dust 2 inches away from the hose sits there. I haven't measured the CFM but my old shop-vac works better. Delta makes poor products and they don't stand behind them"
5,VELVET REVOLVER IS A EDGY BAND!!!!!!!,"When i heard these guys for the first time i couldn't stop listening to them!!!!!! They are a edgy band and they have great metal style which i like!!!!!! I'm a music freak and i like all kinds of music,but when i'm having a bad day and i want to listen to something that is edgy and hardcore kinda then i will put these guys in and they just make those bad days go away!!!!!"
2,"Mostly HYPE album, Scott sounded better on drugs","This is one of those cds that gets talked up like crazy...and later you will find 20 of them for sale at a used cd joint for $1.99.I made the mistake of buying this CD new. I almost always get burned when I buy a CD before listening.I was hoping for STP Ver 2.0 from this band ... instead is more like STP version 0.2, weak music, weak lyrics, just weak.The best songs are Fall to pieces and Dirty little thing.I am impressed that Scott Weimer as gone clean from drugs and supposedly the whole band (minus Slash) is drug and alcohol free. But you know sometimes the best artists do their best work under the influence of drugs and alcohol, Doors, Janis Joplin, Hendrix, Pink floyd, Jefferson airplane...Buy this cd used or ""borrow"" from a friend."
2,Great musicians ok music,"I was excited for the release , but was a little let down upon listening. There is no doubt that this group has the makings of something special, but I believe that special may have been the past. There is nothing really new hear, I was hoping for a early style STP or GNR collaboration but it never seems to materialized, its not a terrible cd but based on the fact that I have listened to the cd a couple of times and now seems relegated to the cd rack must say something."
3,See them live.,"I think this is not what I expect. But on stage they rise as an incredible rock machine far over the rest, a band that makes believeble just a fistful of correct songs."
1,Boycott DRM Cd's like this one...,"Don't let the music industry infect your computer with spyware and viruses. It appears the RIAA is out to destroy the consumer. Don't trust them. They're trying to prevent you from putting music on your iPod, don't let the lowlifes from the recording industry dictate what you can do with your own property.Content Protected CD = NO SALE"
3,had no problem ripping into itunes,"3 stars for music - 0 stars for the ridiculous attempt at copy protection technology.the bottom line is i ripped this no problem into itunes. didn't even have to hold down the shift bar. i just read an article and the label said that consumers are clearly embracing this great new technology - what a crock. i hope nobody mistakes the popularity of this cd with thinking we have no problems with buying more crippled cds.VR's music is solid and grows on you although the production is very thick and muddy. i like the slower ""fall to pieces"" and ""you got no right"" best -probably because they sound the cleanest."
1,Not worth the effort,"Although the music is ok, the CD is not worth buying. This CD prevents you from having control over the music that you paid for. It will only play in a CD player. You cannot easily play the music on your computer. Playing the cd on your computer requires an internet connection to a server which is likely to be unavailable or to busy to connect. There is plenty of music that is equally good or better that will not cause you this much hastle. I suggest that you buy that instead."
2,Not that good...,(1) A few songs are pretty good until you hear scott weilands awful chorus crap that he needs to lose... songs like superhuman are an example(2) Also there are a few slower songs.. they are crap.. except for the last which is good...(3) there are about 4-5 pretty good songs ... but its a really uninspired cd... its missing something... not that good(4) scott weiland is good when he shines.. but otherwise the music is annoying.. i like him and guns.. but this is crappy rock...(5) go buy a real rock cd like black rebel motorcycle club or the darkness or the strokes or the white stripes
2,I dont like this band but...,Its better then usher. Yes this sucks but usher is no longer number 1 in the charts and usher sucks hard (...) then Janna Jammeson. So velvet revolver is lame but Im glad they top usher on the charts. Hey IF they kill pop muisc. I MIGHT buy this peace (...).
3,Ok stuff,"My expectations for this record weren't too high. Its not that I didn't think they would pull it off, but I've realized lately that everything is a masterpiece or crap. I tried to go into this album thinking neither was the case. What I got was largely expected. This is a good rock album, full of guitar riffs and vocals that sometimes are great and other times fair. The biggest let down this record gave me was production. The production values really stink. There is a muddled sound behind the vocals that blend the guitars and rhythm sections together. I would have figured that this album would be crisp sounding, instead it sounds like a dull knife.Audioslave is a much better album than this. The songs are better and the production is crisper. Still Contraband is better than 90% of what is being passed off at ""Rock"" today."
1,Get off the ball,"Can't believe MTV wasted an episode of the Headbangers Ball with this band. Perhaps they fit the ""hard rock"" category, but have them on TRL where they'll be appreciated by younguns who don't know the difference and burnouts who knew them back when. Metal has changed and there's no place for fossils."
3,"Some Great Songs, Some Fillers","Basically the title speaks for itself.Sucker Train Blues 2/5 (This Song Gets Annoying After a While)Do It For Kids 4/5 (As Said Before skip the first 40 seconds and then you have a real gem)Big Machine 3/5Illegal i Song 4/5Spectacle 4/5Fall to Pieces 5/5 (AWESOME BALLAD 1ST OF 2, SECOND FAVORITE AFTER SLITHER)Headspace - 2/5Superhuman 0/5 (This song is absolutely Horrible.

Really Really Lame!!!)Set Me Free 5/5You Got No Right 2/5Slither 5/5 (Personal Fav)Dirty Little Thing 3/5Loving The Alien 5/5 (Another Ballad, not as good as Fall to Pieces, but it keeps growing on you the more you hear it)So why ony 3 stars? 2 reasons Superhuman and the stupid copyright protection. Its too annoying and hopefully this is only a test project. Get rid of both for the second album, and its an easy 5 stars!!!"
4,"Great Music, Horrible Technology",I pressed shift and the auto run program doesnt start up.It still wont import in itunes. It just stays on the first track forever.Please boycott copy control cds. If this is the future then stop buying. Buy small and independent releases. Support artists not corporations!I like Velvet Revolver but I refuse to buy cds with this crap.If I was going to steal the music I would. Even with the control the cd is avail on P2P. So basically the people who are actually buying music are getting screwed.....bummed out...
3,Email me if you want to know how to crack sunncomm,"the cd is alright, but email me and I'll tell you how you can copy the disc with real player or whatever you use......it is a simple procedure that you can get around. See, I like to make mix cd's of my favorite songs, and when I found out that I couldnt do it to this disc, I did the research on how to crack it....ricksplendid@hotmail.com"
5,This album rocks big time!,"some songs sound similar to each other...but itdoesn't matter, because it just kicks A**. In myopinion, this is Slash's best work.during the last song, (a ballad) i raise my lighterin the air, wait for my speakers to stop smoking, andplay it again."
4,"Not GNR, but hey...","...then again not supposed to be. Good solid rock though. If you like audioslave, you'll like VELVET. A mix between GNR / Poison / Crue / Cinderella glam-punk rock with a sting. Not STP / Soundgarden. I love it, refreshing in these days scene. But not 5 stars quite yet. SW sounds like Axl on some places - gotta love it!!!PS Plays and copies on my PC like a dream, but its the South African releasePellie"
3,Nothing to write home about,"I've never been a huge fan neither GNR or STP (more so GNR). Don't think this cd sounds any different than anything out today. Don't even try copying it, you'll just be wasting a cd. This one is encoded. Tried it, will burn, but not listenable."
2,"Music OK, CD work is very bad","For the music, Velvet Revolver is great. Good sound, singing, and lyrics. However, the CD itself is horrible. The geeky people behind the technology of the album suck. I can't listen the album in my computer. I can't see the extra features it brings. It always crashes my computer. It's a poor job.If you want the music, download it at legal and authorized places like iTune. Don't buy the album, it's not worth."
2,Disappointing,"The much anticipated team up of Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland with former Guns 'N Roses members Slash, Duff, and Matt Sorum seemed like a better idea on paper than the actual product. As a band, Velvet Revolver tries to blend both elements of STP and Guns 'N Roses with alternative hooks and power ballad melodies; but it doesn't mix. ""Set Me Free"", a teaser track featured on last summer's Hulk soundtrack, is just that: a teaser of what kind of album ""Contraband"" could have been. ""Do It For the Kids"" is a rocking track, but the power ballads are stale for the most part, and where are the thick and heavy guitar riffs from Slash that we all expected and hoped for? It's still worth a listen, just don't expect anything as profound as the material that these guys have put out before."
2,"Been There, Done That Over And Over And Over Again","Cock rock with tunes galore, just not very good tunes. A hummer now and then [I am guilty of hummin' `Fall To Pieces' myself], but it sounds exactly like what you expect the lead singer of, say, Stone Temple Pilots to sound like if he joined some old, dissipated metal band like, say, Gun's & Roses...oh, wait... My grade: C+"
4,Thank god some bands still know how to have fun.,"This review will be brief. Thank you Velvet Revolver, for reminding the listeners of rock radio that not every rock song has to have angst driven screaming in it. Contraband is trully a fun rock album with lots of high tempo ""bad ass"" songs that reak of influence from the Ramones, Guns and Roses and Stone Temple Pilots. It trully is alot of fun to listen to. Songs like ""Slither"" and ""Sucker Train Blues"" are incredibly driven and defy all authority. On top of that contraband also features one of the best songs of the past five years with ""Fall to Pieces"". Not only does this song send 10,000 goosebumps down the human spine it also is trully sincere. It reflects the real hardships that lead singer Scott Wylde has had to face head on to become a part of this band and save his own life. Thus, this is an incredible CD despite the fact that some other bands like Evanesence may call it boring. It trully worth a gander for any true fan of good hard rock music."
3,Only 3 songs are great the other 10 are regular,"That's right, this album is not the best album these musicians have made but it's good to hear there is conjunction between the band members' characters and of course with slash there are strong reefs and solos; so every one that was worried about the future of metal with this album there's no doubt that this could be the beggining of a good metal band.. Let's judge this album as it is, so eventhough not all the songs are great with those 3 good songs the money spent is worth..."
3,"Before buying it, listen to it!","I got really disappointed when i heard Contraband for the first time. I'm still trying to like it, but there are some really annoying songs. ""Sucker Train Blues"" opens the album and it is an awesome hard rock song, the best one of the album in my opinion, but unfortunately the quality of the songs decreases each time I step forward to the next song. It gets better again when you listen to ""Set Me Free"" and ""Slither"", though. But, honestly, a good title for this album could be: ""Much Ado About Nothing""."
4,Hmm...,"Could Velvet Revolver be to pop-punk what Nirvana was to pop-metal (that is, killing those genres)? Only time will tell..."
3,"It's kind of ""meh""","I was interested in this project when I first heard about it because I thought it would be interesting to see how a Stone Temple Pilots infused with some Guns 'n' Roses might sound like. Unfortunately we won't find out with this one. It sounds like an STP album which is fine if that's what I wanted, but I wanted to see how a marriage would work. What really bothered me was every time Slash would embark on a GnR-style guitar riff, he'd stop and go back into STP mode. It was almost like he was worried about drowning out Scott Wieland so he played it safe.I'm probably being too hard on this album because I didn't mind it at all. I was just disappointed that VR didn't take a more ambitious approach and really mix the two different styles together."
1,irs not that good,"I love STP....they rule still to this dayand I love GNRplus I got this cd early from the Labeland for free!!!and I saw them live in Chicagobut sad to say but this cd is""cliche'd rock....at its worst, withthe worlds best spokesmen""a sad sad day................"
1,why this sucks,I hate it! Where is GNR? Where is Stone Temple Pilots? What happened to these gifted musicians to make them produce such a horrible album? Is the world coming to an end? Yes.
3,"Eww, I can't believe Guns N roses turned into this","Okay, so what you have here is a super group made basiclly of two great bands. The super group should be amazing, right? Wrong! This album just doesn't do anything for me. I hope Axl Rose shows Slash Duff and Matt that they should have known better when he, Buckethead and the new G n R release Chinese Democracy."
1,You can only RENT this music!,"This band feels that it must control the way you listen to the music that you purchase. You can't download to an ipod, nor burn a mixed cd for your own listening pleasure. It's a shame.(...)"
3,Much better mix on this album,"I wasn't impressed with VR as a group when the CD came out, mainly because Slash wasn't heard on the album. I was a big fand of the Slash's Snakepit albums (especially aint life grand). His mix was pretty much very low on the disc and guitar solos were very hard to hear. This version you can hear the band much better. Slash's solo's sound much clearer and the album sounds much richer and you can hear more of the melody on this version.The negative is that the sound remixed album is only on the DVD side, so you can't listen to it in your car. You can listen to it on your computer's dvd drive or your dvd player. so now i need to figure out how to put the sound files onto a cd.The songs truly sound better on the DVD side. The videos are also cool to have."
2,greatest rock band + decent grunge band= Nu Metal?,"I am really disappointed by Contraband. I heard Slither on the radio, and the endless hype of GN'R members and Scott Weiland when it was first released. Guns was a great hard rock band, and Stone Temple Pilots was a decent grunge band from the 90's. But, as over 10 years has passed since their heyday, the musical landscape has changed. Now, instead of valuing great musicianship and songwriting(GN'R), bands value no solos, using large amounts of profanity, and a lack of smart lyrics( Slipknot falls into this category). So, on Contraband, there are no songs that fall into the first category but falls into the second, sadly. The music is shockingly subpar and have a bad nu metal sound. Scott Weiland sounds terrible. It could be blamed because the same man who mixed Linkin Park, John Abraham, mixed Contraband. Yep, this is a supergroup- just like the disaster on VH1. Avoid getting this album if you enjoy real music."
1,Vulgarities can not describe my feelings for this album...,"And its not very good too. How to word it, way too much hype, not enough to back it. It does have its catchy moments, but in the way that KISS musak is catchy, you hear it and it reminds you of something good, but you can't place your finger on it because it's not good.in all seriousness, when you put it to play, the first track is only so-so. nothing stands out, not even Scotts unique vocal style. It wasn't until the 4th or 5th track that I was even moved by it because it fell to the background and was forgotten about. Even then, it started out very cool, then fell dormant by the chorus.GnR, great band. STP phenominal, ahead of their time, at the time. Velvet Revolver, seriously, shame on you for taking ownership of this material.I don't know, if you like mediocre music, you may dig this one, but I guess I just expect more from a band whose guitarist name is an action, and their lead singer has been through rehab how many times now?"
1,disappointed,The music rocks on a few tracks and that't the reason I gave it one star but creepy scott weilands vocals send it all down the drain.
1,cd will not play,this is the second velvet cd i have bought and it still will not play on certain cd players. I will return it and go with something better like 50 CENT. Borrow a friend's copy but don't waste your money people.
5,Essential reading,"Having read the Bible, I was interested in reading some of the books that were not included. This book is well put together and a worthwhile investment in your spiritual journey."
3,France Nuyen Astounds,"This film is a bit stagy, stodgy, and without much energy, but when the gorgeous France Nuyen enters the scene, time stops, complaints are non-existent, and every cell in my body rejoices. The film itself is a rather plodding and ordinary soap opera, but the Hawaiian scenery is beautiful, and the aforementioned Ms Nuyen makes the entire enterprise worthwhile. Rarely have I ever seen a more beautiful woman on screen. She's astonishing, and the one and only reason I own this film."
3,Tropical Tantrums,"I have always enjoyed this movie. Set in glorious Hawaii, Charlton Heston is his usual best with a great support cast. This movie lived up to my memory of first seeing it years ago. It mixes the underlying tension in Hawaii at that time, with the explosive forbidden love tangle. A very pleasant film in many ways with exquisite scenery, good acting, set in a great era and has nice closure. A must for Heston fans."
4,I like it,"I enjoyed the Alamo history but the story was a bit thin, and the characters not up to the usual Burke standards."
2,A Mostly Boring Trip Down Memory Lane,It is hard to imagine that this book will be of much interest to anyone who is unfamiliar with Harvard. For former students the pertinent parts may serve as a mostly boring trip down memory lane. For the real insiders such as professors or administrators or influential alumni it may prove to be more exciting.After finally finishing the book I can only conclude that a story about Harvard or maybe any academic institution is apt to be uninteresting. I feel the same way about the prospect of reading a history of IBM or Xerox - but someone else may find it thrilling.
4,Good Book on women's mysteries,This is great book for those working on celtic tradion and dealing with women's issues even thou i like Starhawk which is more general.This book deal with cetic tradtion which has some useful ideas and spells in book which is nice to see.Even for male reader there is alot of good imformation on the goddess. enjoyBlessed Be:
1,Celtic Women's Spirituality: Accessing the Cauldron of Life,"This book was surprising to me. I am taking a Celtic Spirituality Study Tour through an ecumenical graduate school. This book started out well enough, but turned into a ""how to"" book on very non-Christian themes. The author guides the reader through steps to awaken the goddess within. And guides them to choose the goddess who they will focus their attention on. The Celt's were a pagan people, but there was nothing glamorous about it. They were also a very violent people, not what we would want to embrace in our current society."
3,Filters are too expensive,"The Delta AP200 Shopmaster air filter is an excellent product, however Delta brand filters, at more than $12 each, are way too expensive! I ordered a box standard 12x24x1 furnace filters, 10 for around $32. When the filters arrived they were of equal or better quality then the Delta filters, HOWEVER, they are just slightly too large! Seems like Delta forces you to use their off-size filter, rather than an industry standard. I assume they see consumables as a high margin business.I suggest you consider another other brand air filter system, like Jet, and determine if they can use standard sized filters. If yes, DO NOT buy the Delta air filter system. In the longrun, you will save a ton of money if you can use a standard filter."
3,Poor Quality,I bought this many years ago and would not recomend it. Spend the extra money on their better one. The quality is poor and it is mostly unusable with zero precision...
1,Great for Senior Citizens,"If you like boring music and cool video transitions this is the movie for you. I think the editor of this movie was having more fun playing with the transition effects buttons on his new PowerMac than actually trying to get people excited about climbing. Of you want to see the physical strength, agility, mental toughness, pain, excitant, and exposure all inherent in the sport of rock climbing, this is not the movie that will get your endorphins flowing. If on the other hand you like still video shots of lakes, ponds, streams, and flowers this is a must see."
5,Worth the Price,"I bought two for our twins. So far I am thrilled. The installed very easily for read facing and also very easily for forward facing. The babies are now 12 months old and I wonder if they will really fit in them until they are 3 or 4, but the sales person insists they will. So far we are deilghted with these seats."
2,"Love the Marathon, Hate the Roundabout","I bought the Marathon for my daughter about a month ago and I love it. I've had to move it between cars several times already, and it's so easy to move around. And while it is big for my Outback, it's a great seat.So I expected the same when I bought the Roundabout for my husband's car. First off, we couldn't even find the latches. I almost took it back to BRU before checking the Britax website and discovering them hidden beneath the seat and foam.Then, I discovered the belts on the latch were so short that it made it difficult to get the second latch installed. The final straw was that the belts won't tighten. We've tried to install it 3 times in 2 different cars, and nothing will work. The belts won't tighten and the seat slides several inches each way. I don't understand it--the belts tighten so easily on the Marathon.So I'm returning the Roundabout and getting another Marathon."
5,Perfect seat!!!,"I purchased this carseat when my daughter was 9 months old and outgrew her infant seat. I shopped around and it came down to two Britax products, the other being the Britax Marathon. I chose the Roundabout because although I have an SUV, the Marathon just seemed too large and bulky. I am so glad I chose the Roundabout; it is the perfect size for a mid-size SUV and my daughter has plenty of room to grow (she is now 15 mo.). The cover is easy to remove and washes really well without it wearing and the seatbelt is easy to work with (the velcro straps on the cover makes it easy to keep straps out of the way and untwisted).The biggest plus is the high safety ratings on this seat. You can never put a price on that. Well worth it!!"
4,Great seat for mid-size cars - one single problem...,"Great seat for mid-size cars - I have a subaru which has shallow seats - and this fits well, still allowing room for the front passenger to have adequate legroom. One single problem, however, the straps to secure the child twist and are not easy to fix without removing the seat and reinstalling the straps entirely. If there's a way to fix this problem - this would clearly be the seat to buy, hands down."
5,"Safe, durable and long-lasting for this veteran Britax mom","I bought the Marathon after having used two Roundabouts for my older sons. I had been very pleased with the Roundabout and used them until my sons were almost 4. They loved them, easy to use, and they always fell asleep in them. Worth every penny.The Marathon is a total joke and has a huge design flaw to it - the buckle is too close to the crotch/back of the seat, so there's no way that it could accomodate a 65 or even 25 lb child. I'm so disappointed in Britax for making the Marathon and hawking it as better than the Roundabout. It's not even as plush or padded as the Roundabout. And it was way too big for my minivan!Stick with a good investment and a solid, long-term winner, the Roundabout. I know I'll have it for many more years and get good resale on it like I did the other ones. And the sales cleark at BRU said that they see too many returns on the Marathon because it doesn't fit babies' crotches and it doesn't fit most cars/vans."
4,Love the carseat but,I also did alot of research on carseats and this was one we went with. I love how comfortable the fabric is and how easy it is to get our son in and out of it. The only problem I see is how small the area is to put the seat belt through with your hand when you need to put the carseat in backwards. My husband can not do it at all. So I am the only always having to move the carseat. Otherwise we love the carseat!!
4,A good introduction on the subject,I am a novice in the history of Algeria and its liberation struggle from France. I found this book interesting and very informative although most of the major players in this history were before unknown to me.
3,"Good, but a bit slanted","Exhaustively detailed, this work is probably definitive when it comes to the Algerian independence movement. The writer's prejudices are also unfortunately on display; he views things through the European prism of moral relativity that I found nagging at times. That said, the overall historical narrative is concise. A fascinating historical period that is under-represented in modern discourse, particularly as it applies to France. If you want to know the French world-view in relation to modern problems, you could learn a lot from this tome"
4,"excellent reference, although flawed.","this isn't as much of a review as a warning; the pronunciations throughout the book are botched for the most part. so if you are first learning your hiragana / katakana, i would not recommend beginning with this book or else you will end up quite confused later on when you learn the actual pronunciations.for example, on page 21:(kanji) bamboo = take. (pronounced a of ""mat"", and e of ""end"").my knowledge of japanese is about as basic as it gets, and yet even i know this is wrong. it should be in fact pronounced a bit more similarly to ""tah-kay"".other than that, it's been quite helpful resource. just do your best not to commit the erroneous pronunciations to memory, because they are an integral building block to japanese."
4,Nice Pan,"This pan cleans well, heats evenly, and makes a nice size lasagna for four (with a bit left over). It is about 2.75 inches deep, with my only complaint that I wish it was deeper. Overall, a great buy at 64% off!"
2,A kiss does not a theme make,"I tried to stay with it, but ultimately -- I drifted. Another Asian movie about homosexuality without any homosexual sexuality."
4,Can work on side mount toilets,"I have purchased two of these handles to update my bathroom. Both toilets were a sidemount application. I agree with most reviewers that as designed, the lever is meant for front mount toilets. However the metal arm is easily bent to work for a side mount. I used my old plastic arm as a guide. Overall the quality is very good for the price. My only complaint, albeit minor, is that there is some play in the handle before the arm moves due to the universal nature."
1,"worked for 2 years, handle cracked off","Handle looks great. Only issue is after 2 years, handle broke off. I have a power flush that requires a little more force. Plastic handles never were an issue, this one snapped at the handle leaving me in search of a new one."
1,It is NOT universal,"Contrary to what the packaging claims, this handle will NOT work on a side mount toilet. This sort of false advertising makes one want to avoid all Danco products."
4,Not bad...,"This handle is easy to instal and looks quite good. The finish is nice, with a relatively dark oil rubbed bronze color. The lever itself is quite heavy so that may cause a bit of a problem with some valves since it might create some lifting force that can eventually lead to leaks at the rubber flap in the tank. I prevented this from happening in my side mount application by turning the rod in the tank in a way that now flushing happens with lifting the lever instead of the more natural pushing. This may be strange for first time users (like guests and so) but works just fine :-)Also, Amazon's price is pretty much the same like, say, Home Depot's... not what I'm accustomed to, but hey, at least it's not more expensive :-\"
1,"it never flushed correctly, and the lever eventually broke","The cheapo plastic lever that came with the new toilet worked incredibly better than this product, and the to add to the aggravation of it never flushing properly, the handle of the lever broke off after a month or two."
3,WON'T WORK ON ALL TOILETS,"They are very nice, but, despite what the manufacturer claims, they will not fit TOTO one piece toilets."
2,"Good book for covering the basics, but little else.","I found this book to be fairly basic, and that it really didn't give me many new insights in my life. However, it might be better for other people who are in different situations in their lives, it just wasn't good for me. There are a lot of people out there with very silly ideas about marriage, and this book would set them straight, but offers little else to those of us who already understand the basic principles of a Christian marriage. It did do a good job of establishing some of the characteristics of a good husband and wife, although at times I disagreed with the great importance that was placed on wealth in marriage. The author seems to make the case that gathering wealth is one of the primary reasons to get married, which I would say is false. An OK read, but I would not recommend it too highly."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this planer because it was alot cheaper than the others, mistake. This planer does work but spend a few more bucks and get a planer with a few more features.The feed rollers need help, I usually have to push the board into the planer to keep it moving. There is no locking device, the vibration of the unit causes the cutter heads to move up thus not giving even cut. Does not come with any attachment for dust collection.The planer works great for 4"" to 6"" pine, but struggles with wider boards and most hardwoods. It seems to have plenty of power the feed rollers just don't work well."
2,Caution,"The blades wear easily on just a few sticks of oak. Carbide blades may help if you can find them. The owners manual has sequential page numbers but is missing several illustrations that I downloaded from Amazon. Delta's home page came up blank when I attempted to download the missing pages. A couple of screws rattled out of the machine on my first use. No clue where they belong. The nuts on the knives are so tight that I rounded the 8mm end wrench provided. Had to revert to my Craftsman 8 mm to turn the blades. I have several Delta products, but this is not my favorite."
4,"""my little R2D2"" :)","I see many negative reviews here, so I wanted to post a positive one. I work at a stage door on B'way and have no AC whatsoever once the door to the stage is closed. My friend has lent me her SPT cooling system and it makes all the difference in the world! I haven't had any ""leaking problems"" (that other reviewers have reported.) It's quiet--which is essential so that the show is not disturbed. The 3 speed & ""swing"" function is great because it doesn't blow directly on me the whole time. As long as I've got ice in the bottom drawer, it stays pretty cool in here. I also appreciate the wheels on the bottom to make transferring and storing it easily. All in all, for what its worth, I couldn't be happier!"
2,SPT SF-613 Evaporative Air cooler water is leaking from the bottom of the water storage,I dont know if the unit I received was defective or manufacturing quality control is not properly check before the product is out for market. I hope the replacement unit is no longer defective and in good condition. I could not recommend to my friend until I received the replacement unit and tested for satisfactory operation.
1,Dissapointed,This is my third delta tool. I have the bandsaw and a mitre saw. This is the first dissappointment. I have used my drill only 5 times and my chuck is out of alignment. I bought it do drill holes with a hole saw and can not do this because of the slight wobble in chuck. The drill press is quite heavy and felt solid out of the box. but the machine does not do what I bought it to do. I am using my cordless drill to make holes now and am thinking of buying a larger drill press because of this. It definitely won't be a delta.The Light is a great but I would look elsewhere.
1,not as bad as my chemical romance.,"But I see these guys being the next big thing which is really a shame. It's been done 1,000,000,000,000 times over and sadly better i guess."
1,Breakdowns are stupid,"As a guitarist myself, i really don't see why so many people are taken with a drop e. I mean, they're not that hard to do after all, and when you put 97 of them on one record, it gets downright repetitive. People complain about power chords, but atleast power chords have variation. Every breakdown sounds exactly the same. Metal, metalcore, it all sounds exactly the same, like hip-hop, only not as listenable. Maybe one day metalcore will be no more, but until then, i'd have to advise staying as far away as possible from any of these clones.Listen to:50 centAvril lavineHilary duffLindsay lohanBackstreet boysLinkin parkN*syncor Metallica's debut album ""st. anger"" instead."
2,Asian beauty?,"I picked this up at the book store to see if it may be useful for me, an asian-american. As I scanned through the pages, I saw a lot of pictures of asians with ""white"" features. Most of the models tend to be asians mixed with white or black. None of the models had single eyelids. The makeup also looked very tacky, using colors that did not seem to complement asian skin tones. I cant say this book is all bad. It does have a few good tips for skin and make-up applicators. I still think this book tries too hard to make an asian woman look white. It does not seem to accentuate the natural beauty that asians have. I am glad there is a book that focuses on Asians. I give props to the author. I still think it should be more focused on the typical asian rather than trying to make them look white."
2,"Pretty, but not helpful","This book contains beautiful photographs of stunning Asian and partly-Asian women. However, as far as makeup tips that address all of the different types of problems that Asian women have (no eyelid fold, wide faces, small eyes, thin lips, etc.), it's pretty thin. It was nice to see the wide range of colors that we can use, but that's about it. I already know about drinking a lot of water and getting enough sleep, thanks!Lots of sparkle, little substance. Too bad."
1,ayako,"This book was a total waste of money. There is no useful professional advice at all.Because one of the authors is Asian American, I expected she could talk about some professional technique applicable particularly to Asian faces. nothing.The book is rather about the author's impressions and feelings, such as ""I always found -(Asian faces) --are very mysterious."" But she did not provide with any solid technique to make this ""mysterious"" faces look attractive.Furthermore, all models photographed in this book look like as if they just come out of Chinese opera with heavy make ups (with bright colors that do not go well with Asian features at all.)Bobi Brown's ""Beauty"" talks about Asian faces in short three pages. But it was far more practical, useful and kind advice to help Asian faces look prettier, and Asian women feel confident with their oriental features.Total disappointment."
3,Disappointing,"This book seems to try to cover all aspects of the submarine cold war, without a lot of detail on any particular subject. I found the coverage of the Cuban crisis particularly interesting, but somehow felt as though I had to read between the lines, which was true with all the other subjects covered.All in all, an intersting book, but not in the league of Blind Man's Bluff."
5,re-attached fingers,Lost 3 fingers in construction accident and were re-attached but lost the knuckles on all three. The therapist recommended the tan color.I liked it so much went and ordered all of them so I would know how much I had progressed in finger strength by the level of firmness I was able to use. Excellent product but must be supervised with kids as you do not want it around cloth or anything porous. The 4oz is the best for hand.
3,Good but too expensive,"This book is good but overpriced for the amount of material given.I'd say it should have been about $10.00 cheaper.For a price of $32.95 there should have been some sample adventures and adventure hooks.Also there should have been more magic items especially Good Artifacts.They should have included more interaction with the Epic book, including info for Epic level characters.The Epic Level Handbook was an excellent example of value for money unlike the Book of Exalted Deeds.In keeping with all the preaching about balance in the D&D game they should have included some more prestige classes.Lawful Good got better classes in general than Neutral & Chaotic Good.ALso, if you include 2 female only classes you should have 2 male only ones to keep things in balance.This product fell short of my expectations hence only 3 stars."
5,Needed to stock up!,"My dog absolutely will not put this thing down! I bought a second one as a backup in case she ever loses it. The squeaker and the beans in this bone are the perfect combo. She doesn't rip it up, and its a perfect size for a little dog!"
2,Lower quality than predecessor,"The AP300 replaces the 50-280 in Delta's dust collector line. In my shop I have two 50-280's and was rather disappointed when I opened the box. The blast gates are no longer part of it. The fan shroud is now sealed; on the 50-280 one could easily split the shroud with one bolt to clear the fan blades, now there are approx. 10 sheet metal screws to remove the inlet plate. The base is a flimsy piece of stamped steel; mine arrived bent and was too easily straightened. The hose is only 10' if you stretch it out, at rest it is about 8'. The motor on the AP300 is its only redeeming quality. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is that 1 star is only given to a completely useless POS. If you can find the 50-280 elsewhere, buy it."
2,underachiever,Bought at Lowes for $99 plus there was a rebate(forgot the amount). Works great for dust collectoin from sanding table(also a delta) but does poorly w/ planer(delta) because chips get stuck on protection cage in front of impeller(I may remove this)also leaks where hose fitting is screwed to housing(silicone should solve this). 2 stars because Delta should have thought this out better. Also replced crappy 30 mocron bag w/ 5 micron bag. Big difference!!!
3,Good but not great,"I needed a small Dust Collector to use as a dedicated machine to suck up the dust and chips from a sliding compound miter saw station I built. This unit fits the size requirements I needed but the 3/4HP motor does not have as much CFM as I would like. Additionally, there were three dust leaks, two at the impeller cover and one around the opening for the bag. I sealed the first two with silicone but the second I had to get some thin insulation and replace their strap with a hose clamp. I shortened the length of 4"" hose to the dust hood and with those improvements the unit is still only marginally good. But for the price it does an ok job. I definitely would not recommend this unit for collecting dust from a planer, table saw, shaper, jointer, or router table. I would also like to have received something better than the supplied 30 micron bag."
4,"Handy, but vibration noises","Needed something small; this collectors is relatively small and portable and does the trick. Arrived in a box that I felt may not be adequate to protect its contents, but it turned out fine. The collector arrived in perfect condition; nothing was damaged, and it seems to be well made.The collector works fine. The only complaint I have is that it sometimes tends to make loud noises; I think these are vibrations from the fan being transferred into the rest of the metal enclosure. When I move the handle or otherwise change the contact between 'fan-enclosure' and base just a little bit, the noise disappears. Probably end up putting some rubber or thick paper between motor and fan housing so that they cannot make a hard contact and transfer vibration."
3,A great OLD bood,This is one of HCH's first. The 1936 edition is dated...wonderfully. None of the cowboy's looks like George Strait. The color pictures are wonderful and the border drawings wonderful embelishments. Jump into the modern day and the book had shrunk by 75% and the color is gone. Reading it to a child will take a magnifying glass. And I still recommend trying to do just that. But buy a nice old used copy somewhere first.
5,Fun Grammar,I ordered this book for my daughter. She needed it for a class. She has really enjoyed reading it. It puts those grammar snobs in a fun light.
2,I guess I'm a snob then...,"I wanted to like this book, but unfortunately the author seems to have put more effort into trying to be entertaining than getting things right. Starting on page 4, an omitted closing quotation mark might have been a simple typographic error, but an insistence on page 23 that the word ""up"" in ""The baby can sit up"" is an adjective (no, it's an adverb - up modifies sit, not baby) made me throw up my hands in resignation and, I confess, stop reading. I find no pleasure in reading a book on grammar that not only makes mistakes but vehemently defends them.Did the author write this book in response to accusations of being a grammar snob? If so, she has a lot more explaining to do."
3,Preety Good,"This was my first Virtue cd and the only reason I bought it was because I heard that Asaph (Alex) Ward produced it. Im a big fan of Alex and PAJAM. If you are too then you wont be disapointed. Best Trax-1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13 and 14. Most distinctive, heart-felt and ear-pleasing song is track 5. Go ahead. Its safe to buy this one. 5 star cds in my book would be Karen Clark-Sheard, Finally Karen and Kim Burrell, Everlasting Life."
2,Good Cd...Many songs too short,"The songs with the hip hop flavor are complete and sound very good. The slow songs are too short many range a 3 minutes without quick fade out at the end. I am a musician, and this Cd would be top notch if many of these songs had an ending closure to it. I understand that some are necessary for the ambiance but not every slow song needs a fade out. Just when I start to feel the vibe of these songs they fade out and go to the next track. Overall the songs are great. Just wish they had more closure."
3,"Interesting, if not quite the business","The pictures are excellent, while the text is good in parts. The drawings, where they exist, are pretty poor. Also, the selection of the boats seems random, at best, leaving you with the feeling that the authors chose what they had access to, rather than based on more specific criteria. I have nothing against subjective, even quirky choices, but I have a very hard time calling some of these boats classics, whatever your definition for it.Anyway, it's a nice book, if not terribly informative. So, buy it if you really like older boats, or if, like me, you're a fan of designer Bruce King. Or for some subjective, quirky reason of your own."
4,A filler for my shopping cart....,"I was annoyingly short $3.00 for Amazon Free Shipping. So I added this item to my shopping cart.The product itself was okay. Although there were several sheets, the sheets were extremely thin and did not work that great. They are the same paper consistency of the toilet seat covers you use in public restrooms.I liked the ones from Bath and Body Works better. This item did remove oil, but it took three or four sheets for it to do the job whereas I only needed one or two from Bath and Body Works.Overall, it was a good filler for my shopping cart. I didn't like the item too much because of the quantity I had to use...but it did work."
5,toner,In a few words it does the job! I would recommend this to other women. Fast service. Thank you I'm very pleased.
2,good idea,"This tool belt is a good idea and feels great...here's the lowdown. In the field the loops on the back of the pouches for the horizontal belt are weak. They broke within two weeks. Bucket Boss makes great products and I hope that they would upgrade this unit as soon as possible. I wish that I would have bought mine here, alas I did not and am now stuck with it."
3,good but not great,"I have been in the trades for over 40 years, and used many tool belts. This belt is more for Western framers than Eastern, the whole debate, worm drive vs, sidewinder saws etc. If you are not used to a rear hammer holder, you will find it hard to get used to. The bags hang on your side, and not the front. These are the things I like because it makes it easy to bend over and not get pinched in the gut, by quick squares, tapes, racks of 16 sinkers, etc. This is a great belt to see if you like the side bag system, shoulder harness, rear hammer, only $40. Good bags cost $100 to $200 for any type, so not much lost is you don't like. The reason for the 3 stars, the hammer holder broke the first week, and the x brace across the back moves during the day which pulls the bags around to the rear. I reposition everthing at lunch and start again, it's a pain."
4,so so,for the price not bad. the betsis to flimsy and twist up. so i got a heavy duty bets but the harmer holder would not fit so i got a different one over all not bad.
3,A very exciting beginning leads to...,"...nothing in particular. Or rather, one emotion played out over and over ad boredom. That first scene is definitely worth the $2 or so that this DVD costs, at least if you're a fan of Kurosawa and Mifune. It's full of excitement and intrigue and everything that the whole rest of the movie doesn't seem to value.The other reason for buying this is that, towards the end, there's a(n unearned but) prototype monologue for Mifune that would be perfected in Seven Samurai, full of inner conflict and yelling. The moral of the movie (spoiler alert?) is that you should deprive yourself of what you want and help people that won't appreciate you. The End."
2,How not to make a message film,"This is the first Kurosawa-Mifune film that I found really difficult to sit thru. In look and style, it felt like a melodramatic silent film. I wish it were silent. I found Mifune's monologue on his internal struggle between his syphillis and his sexual desires (the ""quiet duel"") so badly acted that it was embarrassing.That monologue expressed the movie's intended lesson. For the analytical, there are embedded lessons on how not to make a message film."
2,Museum DVD,I was looking for more specific details about the cars shown. It just breezed through some of the museums. I found it less interesting than other Classic auto DVDs I've purchased.
4,Works well for small applications,"I have a larger Delta dust collector that I have used in my shop for many years. I needed a dust collector for the opposite side of my shop where the larger collector wasn't doing very well due to a long run of pipe. I would recommend this collector for machines (band saw, radial arm saw, etc) that do not generate a lot of large chips and where short pipe runs are involved. A planer or jointer would fill the bag very quickly and, I believe, would not be suited as general shop dust collector. It is not very mobile as the dust bag tends to drag behind the collector when it is wheeled about. Overall, it has been a good purchase for me and does all that I expected."
1,"4"" connector kit","Although this kit contains several fittings, tees, angles, screw on connectors for the 4"" tube, clamps etc....NONE OF THE FITTINGS seem to fit each other. I have been forced to grind the inner diameter of any part I want to fit.Have tried to contact Delta by phone several times. No support e-mail address that I can find.Perhaps you could get somewone at Delta to contact me....Thanks:Walt 719/845-1091 or lobos@starband.net"
5,The Best Available,"The authors of this book, husband and wife, did a service to the pharmacy community by putting together a great collection of pharmacy and medical historical pieces that were sketched and written about. It is a compilation that is the best around."
1,ARE THESE SHIPPING PRICES CORRECT?,CHECK AMAZONS SHIPPING PRICES CLOSELY BEFORE BUYINGPORTER CABLE 12 IN COMPOUND MITER SAW $9.99DELTA 12 IN COMPOUND MITER SAW $49.99(SAME SAW AS PC ABOVE)DEWALT 12 IN COMPOUND MITER SAW FREEHOW CAN THIS BE ? THESE PRICES FOR SHIPPING ARE AS OF NOV. 4 2005
4,Great but not perfect,"I bought this saw to replace my Hitachi 10"". The first draw back is the Delta only goes to 47 degrees as my hitachi could go out to 60 degrees. After setting up the saw and squaring up the fence I went to set up the lasers and ran into some problems. The hole milled for the left laser was slightly over sized causing the laser to jump and not be true to the blade. I took a center punch and put a couple of punches around the outside of the housing and it tightened right up. Other then these draw backs this is a great saw. For the price you just can not beat it. I still can not believe the Porter Cable (same saw) is so high priced."
2,It is a debut of the GIANT,"Debut book by John Irving is disappointing only when you have previously read all others, like I did. The story is about Vienna (a recurring theme in all of his prose) and misery of the postwar aftermath with foreign occupants. The Viennese Zoo animals were released and eaten at the end of the war. Irving fantasizes about this event. I could not manage to finish the book, however. He is a talented novelist, but I should have switched the order of reading and start with ""Bears"". After all others, I am not able to recommend the book even to myself."
2,Incomprehensible,"As a long time fan of John Irving's post Garp books, you can't imagine how disappointed I was in this incomprehensible mess. So many words wasted on such a slim idea."
2,boring,I didn't like this book. It was silly and juvenile in a bad way. I can tell it was his first book.
3,"Don't Worry, Irving Gets Better","I am a huge John Irving fan, and have been ever since I read A Prayer for Owen Meany several years ago, unfortunately this book is a disappointment. As always Irving does a wonderful job creating his characters and making the reader interested in their lives, but Irving was not at his best this early in his career. I am never a fan of Irving's short stories that he puts in the middle of his novels (Pension Gripalzer etc.) and a majority of this book is a journal written by ine of the characters, so that upset me. He also does not include wrestling and does not make any of the characters writers, which I always like in his novels because he knows the subjects and writes about them so well. I think if you are looking for an introduction to Irving or are just looking for a good book A Prayer for Owen Meany, The World According to Garp, or Cider House Rules would be much better bets."
3,Nice little jointer to get by with,"Almost 4 stars. This is a nice little jointer if you work on very small projects AND don't have a lot of space in your workshop. I would love to have the nicer (but larger) JT360 in my shop as an upgrade some day, as I think it would be a better value (even though it is a little more money than the benchtop JT160). I have my benchtop jointer set at about 2-1/2 on the speed setting for most 3/4"" thick material, and often clamp it in a portable work stand (with an adjustable top) in the middle of my garage."
3,Okay for a hobbyist - Serious woodworkers shouldn't bother,"I owned one of these for about a year and a half. Functionally, it worked fine and had plenty of power to edge-joint boards. It had a resonable amount of power for such a cheap machine, and was fairly quiet. I put it through some pretty serious workouts but finally realized the sad truth. You simply cannot expect this jointer to work on pieces much longer than 2-1/2ft. It is incapable of doing the job, and you will end up with gaps in the center of your work.If you only work with short pieces of wood, then this might be all the functionality you need. If you purchase this machine, you will always be limited. Otherwise, you can do what I did and sell this machine and apply the money towards a jointer capable of doing the job. I purchased the Grizzly 6"" 1182Z and it has corrected my problems and seems to be a great performer. The price isn't bad, either. Don't make my mistake....buy what you will ultimately be happy with. Don't ""settle-for""."
4,Great tool for the price,"I have owned this bench top jointer for a few months now. I was a little hesitant on spending $200. But this tool is worth it. It runs quiet and very smooth. Every part of the tool is made solid, except for one thing. The clamps to adjust the fence are weak plastic. And in some placements they actually run into one another, so you can't completely tighten down the height or the angle. That is my only complaint. I would recommend this tool for anyone on the market for any jointer, to check this one out."
2,Don't bother,"Spend the extra money and by a good (free-standing) Jointer (You're going to eventually, once you realize how useless this product is on anything but the smallest scale project). I built a couple of small end tables with this jointer, but when I went to put a straight edge on some longer lumber I am using for a desktop, I was not able to effectively do it (I eventually rigged-up my router table to do it). It is mainly 'cause the outfeed table is so short.Also, there is no way to effectively hook up a dust collection device to this. I ended up using a magnetic dust chute, but it's still not very effective."
4,Jointer,"This jointer is a gift for someone, have opened it up to check it and plug it in to make sure that the motor runs ,But have not did any workwith it , but at this time and what I have seen it looks good.Thank You."
1,poor quality,I bought this unit and tried to set things up so everything was flush and true only to discover that the infeed table was badly warped. I took it in for service and they had the gall to charge me for repairs. The fence is horrible. I am really sorry I bought this thing and will never purchase another delta tool.
2,Tough to review a pair when you only get one,"They look nice - but I have only seen one - they shipped me a box missing the other shoe. The box even has large holes in the side and that lonely shoe was just rattling around in there - pretty obviously alone I should think.I called them at the number on the invoice, good service. But no pickup - had to head over to USPS (on Tax Day!) and mail that poor shoe back to them. They did refund the USPS charge as well and in a reasonable period of time."
5,Great as usual,"Ms. Castle has done it again. I always enjoy reading her books. Full of action, love story and humor. More please."
4,Paranormal romance done right,"A more engaging novel than the two previous in the Harmony series, Ghost Hunter is the tale of Cooper Boone, ghost hunter guild boss of the Cadence suburb of Aurora Springs, and Elly St. Clair, daughter of a guild boss with a new psi talent, the ability to resonate with plants. Cooper and Elly are on the trail of some drug dealers and a 'blue freak,' a hunter who can make and manipulate blue ghost energy, something previously unheard of.Because of the nuances of these two rare psi talents, I found this story to be more interesting. Castle is a master of creating a world and then building up on it. Her paranormal romances resonate with exciting twists. Really, it's like reading three genres at once: romance, science fiction, and mystery. I would definitely recommend this book to a fan of any of those genres."
2,Another JAK/JC Waste of Time,I don't know why I keep buying these books - they are just so mediocre. Boring and formulaic doesn't begin to describe it. It took it with me on vacation and didn't even bother to bring it home to resell.
3,Great price - functional machine lacks precision,"You can't beat the price.You could improve the quality.However, not bad for a starter scroll saw. This saw gets the job done, as long as you are not expecting high precision.Two gripes:1.unacceptable high level of vibration at higher speeds for any kind of precision cutting(perfectly acceptable at slower speeds)2.misalignment of blade locks cause blade to shift slightly from side to side as it goes up and down. Can't seem to figure out how to adjust. From other reviews, I don't think Delta support will be much help.Otherwise, it works just fine for my needs. This is a case of 'you get what you pay for'."
4,good ----zeer hul vol !,"Hello ,Het is een goed boek maar er kan soms wel wat beter uitgelegd worden de mensen die dit boek kopen kennen er niets of niet veel van en dan is het wel soms niet duidelijk .Maar voor de rest is het een heel goed boek en zeker aan te raden als je met deze super v8's wilt werken .Grtz Steven"
4,It worked okay,I have seen much better but for the price this isn't bad. You have to really pay attention to where you install the device and two would do the job better.
5,A real treasure trove of practical and tempting treats!,"As an avid baker, cook and collector/reader of cookbooks, I can't recommend this work too highly. Malgieri is an engaging and talented teacher (you can catch him on TVFN) who really knows his stuff. But best of all, he is a great communicator, sharing both basic techniques and ""tricks of the trade"" gleaned from many years of experience. His recipes are well-written, well-tested, reliable and DELICIOUS! I consider myself to be rather accomplished in the kitchen, but I still learn quite a bit from him every time I try a new recipe. This book is a fabulous addition to the library of novice and experienced bakers alike!"
1,bon scott before ac/dc,"Bon Scott before ac/dc has 3 horrible songs on it, can only be played on your computer and has videos with angus playing guitar....Bon scott before Ac/dc ????Three songs by bon scott with video of angus playing guitar...it horrible and a waste of money....."
3,A Nice Try That Falls Flat,"_Roger Fishbite_ tries, and fails, to recreate _Lolita_ from the child's point of view. It fails, in my opinion, because only the absolute genius of Nabokov can make this genuinely repellent subject matter appealling. Prager is certainly a good writer, but her protagonist speaks with the voice of a mildly unappealing teenage girl. In the end this book fails to maintain the balance between comedy and tragedy that Nabokov so artfully maintains, and _Roger Fishbite_ plunges into the realm of bathos. This is the stuff of which Jon-Benet Ramsey was made."
3,Mechanically excellent but The Table is a pain,"I bought this version of the Delta 12 inch press due to problems which others had experienced with the later version which has an ""automatic"" speed control.I do not use it a lot, but I have had absolutely no problems with it mechanically and it does what I need it to do. In fact, for the price I would probably buy it again. The only problem I do have is that attaching a vise to the table is a pain due to the casting supports on the bottom of it. It is hard to find a flat spot where you can tension the vise within the confines of the slots available for adjustment.Perhaps I have not found the right vise. But, I am getting a bit tired of drilling holes into the vise from time to time due to the difficulty of getting a proper alignment of the vise and table holes."
2,Under powered,"This drill press is adequate as a bench top unit. Initially I was fairly happy with it, other than some vibration from the spindle. But the more I use it the more I am dissapointed with it. The minimum spindle speed is 620 which is too fast for my hole cutter ( recommended 400 RPM). Delta should change the pulley ratios to allow an alternative slower speed rather than so many at the higher end. I used my hole cutter anyways and ended up barely being able to cut a 3"" diameter hole the drill kept stopping. It appears as if the motor just stops under load. I noticed a similar problem using a small diameter forstner bit. I hope that my motor needs to be replaced, and it isn't just that that's the best that 1/3 hp can do."
2,no good,"the same story format over and over again , gets very boring not at all what I expected glad I didn't pay cash for it"
1,..only because there is no zero star rating,"Shamelessly derivative of Terry Pratchett's Diskworld series, difffering primarily in the fact that it is free of plot, interest, or humor, if you define humor as being funny. I read over two thirds of the book before I realized there was nothing there. Thanks for wasting eleven hours of my life. As our illustrious commander in chief said, ""fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, won't get fooled again."""
3,Blu-ray *wince*,"I will not comment on the movie as anyone knows it is one of those classics that we have come to expect from john Woo, along with Hard Boiled and a Better tomorrow I and II.To be honest this is a really really poor transfer as relates to Blu-Ray, from the awful sound at the opening credits, to the moments of sound loss during the movie. flicking around my settings I managed to get a half decent sound as opposed to the modern Blu-rays which ""auto"" switch to DTS.My recommendation is if you already have it on reg DVD to not bother buying the Blu-ray as there are no real improvements if you have it on VHS then an upgrade is probably wise if only to have the ability to slow mo your favorite parts and scene select."
3,NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION. Dissapointed.,"This was not the original version. It was a nice movie and the copy was decent but it was missing too many scenes. It was like when you go to the movies to see a movie and then on dvd it has some scenes cut, and again if you wait a few more years on tv it has more scenes cut and yet then again a few more years on the newest dvd if you didnt buy it the first time around, you would notice even more scenes were missing. This was that version. Too many scenes were missing. I was greatly dissapointed by the missing content as it was a childhood movie my family enjoyed for years and thought we had recovered."
5,Great find!,"I needed this for a friends birthday and couldnt find it anywhere but here! It shipped fast and played very well for being an old tape, the box has a few nicks but i was told that and its not bad. I cant wait to give it to my friend!"
5,Elvis Impersonators,I am a huge fan of Elvis Presley. I was not fortunate enough to see him in person. I enjoy seeing Tribute Artists. I have seen some really good ones and some not so good but I enjoy them and listening to Elvis music.
4,What is the extended version?,"I have seen this version in New York and the producers assured the audience that this was absolutely all that they could restore. According to them, they had not much significant footage other than what is in the extended film, nor any guidance as to what Peckinpagh wanted to do beyond this point. All things being equal, I believe that they are sincere and that therefore this is the closest we will get to Peckinpagh's intention.BEWARE though- the print that was screened in New York was an extremely dirty print full of nicks, scars, noise and the like. Let's hope a considerable digital restoration saves this DVD version."
4,"Great movie even better ""STARS""","Gotta admit it I'll buy any movie with Senta Berger in it, but still this 1 is great, also don't miss ""Cast a Giant Shadow"" has Senta in it."
4,Pleasing harp renditions of classic hymns,"This collection of Christian worship songs set to the harp shows McClure's skill, not just from a sense of proficiency (which she certainly displays), but from the standpoints of laudable music selection and arrangement. It is a superior set of songs, well performed and perfectly suited for any contemplative atmosphere."
2,Why so cold?,"I really believe the main character in the story was very cold to her children and everyone else around her. She is very heartless, has no feelings and no empathy to her children, especially to her son, Money. No wonder he turned out the way he did! When her oldest daughter was raped she did not offer her one hug, no reassurance or anything like that. She was basically left to finch for herself. I am shocked that they did not come to hate her. I do not think she is a good example of a ""Mama""."
2,Well-written-Unrealistically Depressing Story,"I know the title of this review sounds contradictory, but that's what I think of this book. Frankly I did not like this story. It made me depressed! But I have to give the author her props on her writing as usual.You're a natural!"
1,Very unrealistic,This book was very unrealistic. Being from a poverty background I found it not having a very good picture of the struggle. Just because they were poor the mother did not have to go around sleeping with every man in town to get the rent. That is not how it is in the real world. All homes are different but this was not a good portrayal of the african amerian family in poverty.
4,""" Exhilarating! Mildred is breathtaking!""","This story is a great view of the african american woman as a mother. Trying to support her four children in Michigan, Mildred goes through all obstacles possible. I recommend this book to all people. You'll enjoy it!"
3,Not up to Par,"I have this habit of reading the first book by a given author after I have read the other later books. I have to say that this was the worst book written by Terry McMillan that I have read, and I have read all of her books. It was very choppy and I didn't feel much emotion when I was reading it. I wish she would have expanded on some of the characters that seemed so important to the book when they were introduced, like Bootsey and Angel. They are perfect examples of children coming from a disfunctional family. The best part about it is that it was so real much like all of her books. I guess for the first book ever published she did an exceptional job, but she did much better with her other novels. Like most good authors we see the continued growth through out her novels."
1,Total dissappointment,"I wish I had NEVER spent my money on this useless Dictionary! If I knew how to 'write' in Farsi, then it would be great. I need a Dictionary, just like all other language to language dictionaries; the words in English and then the other select language. Even if the alphabet is different, it should have it written 'phoentically' to say the least!"
1,sized very small,I normally wear a size 10 1/2 shoe. I have always bought Clark's because of their comfort and durability. I purchased a size 11 med. They were so tight and uncomfortable. I had to send them back and pay shipping both ways. What a waste of money. I will buy them locally to assure a comfortable fitting.
4,I bought 3.,"I liked this so much I bought 3. At first I was disappointed in the quality. The preproduction images where much better than the toy as usual. But once I opened it up I was very pleased with it. It's too bad they are so close to having a 5 star toy here, there are minor details that hold it back. Much better than the older version. Very cool.Update: The head is too thin, the visor comes to a point. The weapons are not very good. The gun has a pointless trigger finger hole and the sword is fat and lacks detail. The newer version (Desert Battle Snake Eyes) is much better, the head is near perfect."
4,Nice heavy drill - with mechanical flaw,"(...)Setup: 3 stars (the Delta shipping grease again)Repair flaw: 1 starUse When it isn't broken: 5 starsBroken: Two times in 6 months - 0 stars...This drill broke again today; the variable speed control snapped inside the housing. This second mechanical failure, combined with the wobbling chuck I have endured the last couple times I used it, have forced me to publicly condemn this machine as unfit to sell. I don't mind maintaining my machines occasionally, but I have put in over 8 hours of labor vs. less than one hour using the drill. Presently I am sick of it and will decide if I should try to fix it again, or just buy one from a different manufacturer.(...)"
4,"Nice camera, but be warned","I just got this camera the other day. The listing says 18 hrs? Sounds nice. The box says 16+, the manual says 16 with OPTIONAL battery. So far, it seams like a sound product. The only problem I have run into so far is that the battery packed with the camera won't take a charge."
4,Great sound quality--except for the dance mix...,"As a collector of 80s 12"" single mixes on CD, I was actually thrilled to see the 'dance mix' of The Smart Bomb included here--although, it isn't particularly a 'dance' re-mix, simply an extended version. However, it is blatantly mastered (barely) from vinyl. You can actually HEAR the needle dancing in the groove of the vinyl at the beginning of the song, and there is noticeable noise and hiss indicative of vinyl throughout the track. Sure it's great to have it preserved on CD either way, but it would have been nice if they could have found a clean copy of the vinyl."
5,Totally '80s!!,"What do you get when you put C. Thomas Howell, Lori Loughlin,& Corey Haim in a movie together? You get a quintessential '80s movie! It's cute, funny & enjoyable to watch. It may not have ranked up there with ""16 Candles"" & ""Breakfast Club"", but it holds it's own and has it's own brand of charm. The plot is your basic boy wants girl, girl doesn't want boy, but girlfriend wants boy, but he doesn't know she is alive type of plot. To add to this, a series of love letters seem to get into the wrong hands which triggers a series of misunderstandings. All and all it makes for an entertaining hour & forty minutes of pure '80s nostalgia."
5,Yeah! I do think so!,"What a great film! It's a great teen film! If you like the whole teen flick thing, you'll love this! Also with the added bonus of it being the great 80's (memories! ) and with Kelly Preston! Watch It!"
1,Poor preformance,"I have owned the Delta Router / Shaper for several years now and have come to dislike the height adjustment. Every time that I need to make the slighest adjustment, the spindel will shift to the left when tigtned by the lock. This makes for repeatable, accurate cuts impossible. I have looked at other Delta router / shapers and they seem to do the same thing.If any one has an answer for this problem, please let me know as I am about to junk this machine. I own many other Delta and Porter Cable tools that I am very satisfied with. I guess they all can't be perfect."
1,Poor quality machine,"Thought I could save some money, but it's true - - you get what you pay for. Fence is pathetic!! Called Delta Customer Service for help in locating an after-market ""quality"" fence, and they just passed the buck. Spindle height adjustment is also very bad. Fine tuning is impossible. Overall - a total waste of money spent. I thought Delta was better then this. I sure was surprised!!"
4,Review,"One thing I look for in a book are color photos from ""the wild"". I didn't see any of that, but there's plenty of information to go through and lots of references for further study."
5,Great value,"Quality construction. Tool rests are solid cast(not flimsy stamped like a lot of other grinders in this price range). Angled channel in right tool rest is great for sharpening drill bits. Super quiet - almost too quiet (can hardly tell that it's running). For the price (39.99 at Lowes), it has an attached flexible lamp!! Sturdy plastic spark deflectors are easily adjusted and are very transparent, so you can still see what you are doing. The only thing missing is variable speed control (how often would you find that feature useful?)."
5,Awesome saw for it's price range..!,"I have used this little miter saw for the better part of a year and a half. It's probably the power tool I use most often. It has never failed to deliver exactly what I expect of it.I agree with other reviewers that the compund adjustment could be better. However, I have nothing but praise for this saw.No other compund in this price range (under $100) is as reliable nor accurate. Sure, there will come a time when I will upgrade, but if you need an excellent quality saw for starters, there is simply no better buy for the money than this little champ. Thanks Delta..!"
2,Check your miters,"Be sure to check your alignment on this saw before operating. Mine was about 1/4"" in six inches on the perpendicular. Thats alot. The holes that allow adjustment of the fence for this weren't big enough so I had to bore larger holes to get it into alignment. I still have problems getting tight miters. Otherwise, the saw is easy to operate, has plenty of power, and it is easy to change angles. The dustbag doesn't do a very good job of collecting sawdust, will have to go to a dust collection system to keep sawdust off of my cutoff table. I wouldn't recommend my saw to anyone doing any kind of fine work, probably okay for cutting 2 x 4's if you get it into alignment."
5,Great bang for the buck,"Bought the Delta MS250 3 weeks ago to replace all the base molding in my house - very happy with performance. Can cut within 1/16th accuracy. I got a price match at Sears (from Lowes). The quality is good, I really like that it's small and light. Dust bag is pretty useless, dust goes about everywhere else. Looked at the usual Craftsmans with lasers and such, but I can achive good accuracy just lining up with the blade and am pleased with my decision. For the price I don't think you can do better, though this Delta is inexpensive the quality is good."
3,would not buy again,While this has a lot of information in it I do not find it worth the money. I have since found others that have ease to use.
4,Global Awakening,"A very good synopsis of 5 major happenings on the planet that says we are headed into very different times spiritually. If you are in touch with the planetary consciousness and it's (our) evolution, this video is a must."
2,Disapointing,"I also ordered these earrings, expecting them to be pink like the pair in the picture. Although they are well made, they are white; no hint of pink can be found. These earrings are nice if the color doesn't matter to you , but don't expect them to look like the pair shown."
4,Nice Product,I recently purchased this skillet at my local Kmart for $29.95. I have used it a few times so far and it seems to perform very well. It seems to get hot very fast so cooking time is quicker than I'm used to but I will adjust to this. I'm happy with my purchase.
5,good deal,with three in college I try to save every where I can good source for book. great shape no tears or marks just what he needed. great price.
4,Tajmah's Review,When I recieved the Norton Field Guide to Writing it looked as though it was practically brand new. No problems with it. I recommmend this product.
1,No redeeming qualities whatsoever,"This production is the worst production imaginable. The opera is cut by half. The singers are paralyzingly mediocre, especially the tenor. He hasn't learned that classifying yourself as a tenor doesn't necessarily make you one. The costumes look as if they had been designed by fourth graders. To top everything off, the orchestra (which appears seriously reduced) is crammed into a mini-temple on the side. A total joke! Purchasing it is a waste of money; watching it is a waste of time. I wondered if any other operas butchered at this so-called festival have been recorded. I could only imagine what they would do with a work of real quality, i.e. Wagner. The thought has me already breaking out in a cold sweat."
4,JA Henckels Fine Edge Synergy Asian Pieces,"This is the cheapest line of JA Henckels offerings, but they are decent. The brushed stainless back edge is nice, but a few of the knives have this back edge out of tolerance with the handle, so the fit between them isn't always terribly smooth. All told though, a very nice set of knives for the cost."
5,John Woo's best work,"""Hard Boiled"" is definitely within the top twenty Hong Kong movies.Chow Yun-Fat (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Once A Thief"", ""A Better Tomorrow"") and Tony Leung pair up in ""Hard Boiled"" to stun the audience with a film, that in every aspect defines perfection. With creativity and original scenes, it is surprising to know that John Woo directed ""Mission: Impossible 2"", for ""Hard Boiled"" far exceeds ""M:I2"" in every facet.With creative technology, very effective dialogue, unpredictable occurences, it is all topped off with Tony Leung's best performance, and one of Chow Yun-Fat's best as well. Special effects, stunning acting, and themes even manage to give the ""bad guys"" perspective without being bias. -Priscilla"
4,"Great action scenes , great plot.",John Woo is at his best in this hard-hitting hardcore action movie.This movie is ablaze with action.The story is pretty good the action scenes great and the charachters are cool!
1,Cheesy and ridiculous,"I can't believe how well people rate this movie; it was absolutely horrendous. All the gun battles were ridiculously unrealistic and way overdone. All the characters are shallow and most of the conversation is vapid. The body count in this movie must be several hundred. But what is worse, is that there are these sappy moments with the cheesy music where we're all the sudden supposed to care about the plight of one man after we just watched 100 invalids at the hospital get gunned down.I have to say, I'm really not a big fun of most of the action movies Hollywood pumps out, but they are significantly better than John Woo's Hong Kong flics. I still can't get over why people rate this movie so highly after what I just saw. My faith in humanity is crumbling ...."
2,A Waste of Time and Money,"If you are a student of the martial arts, don't bother to watch this movie. There are only two scenes where martial arts are used, the rest is pyrotechnics and tumbling around. This movie has to be worse than the worst American Western where the cowboys guns never run dry, except in face to face confrontations. Give me Bruce Lee anyday!!!"
3,Didn't like it,I like John woo's Hong Kong films. I have all of his movies include Hollywood movies. This was the last one I bought.Honestly I didn't liked it.Chew Yun Fat was not charm enough to be loved in this film.John woo's slow motion shot didn't really worked. It looked like some cheap movies.I hoped there were more subtitles like Korean.The image and sound were as same as DVDs.Nothing surprising.
3,"great film, horrible transfer","This is simply a great action-packed, incredibly violent film. Woo is a master of the shoot-out scene and there are plenty of them in this flick. The camera work is amazing. It's smooth, it's poetic. Its influence on The Matrix is very clear. However, this DVD is one of the worst film transfers I have ever seen. The quality image is almost unwatchable, at least for my taste. Dirt, scratches, burn marks are everywhere. The film looks like it was dragged across the floor, stepped on, dumped on, then left to sit a few days for the rats, cockroaches, racoons, and other wildlife to trample all over it before it was transfered onto the DVD. Do not buy this DVD. Rent it, or if you can afford it (and find it), buy the Criterion Collection edition instead."
1,Wrong on all levels.,"This movie is fantastic.However, it lists special features it does not have.The sound quality is... meh.The video quality is like a first-generation DVD. It's extremely piss poor, especially for a Blu-ray disc.My copy was shipped without a factory sticker and it was obviously re-shrink wrapped.This purchase was bullsh*t of the highest order!"
4,Good Action Flick!,I really enjoyed watching this movie since I love acton flix. The english subtitles throughout the movie were a little hard to keep up with but okay. Overall a good action flick!
2,"too big, too heavy","I found these earrings to be bigger, heavier, and of lower quality materials than I expected. The stones are nice, but the setting seems cheap/fake looking. I haven't worn them much at all sadly."
1,"Disappointing,Waste of$!Exercises not as the title suggested","There are hundreds of fitness video targeting for thighs, butt, stomach but I couldn't find any tapes tagaretting on arms and chests. So I decided to order this tape from amazon at once.I was very exciting when I received it so I immediately put it in my machine, then after 5 mins of gabbling(her accent is annoying btw), the actual workout still has not begun. Then I realised some of the exercises required a bench but it hasn't been mentioned on the tape cover. Worst is, the whole workout is only 35 mins long, so I was left with less than 10 mins for each exercises group after all the ""introduction"". I wouldn't hv complained if the exercises are effective and/or if Cory has brought in something new, but these are just standard exercises that u can easily find in a fashion magazine(note: not even fitness magazine)..."
1,Poor Design on Delta's Part,"I purchased this drill for woodworking and have used it less than 4 times since purchase. The top pully on the motor has a poor design to it and the sleeve that it is keyed to will came apart during normal use. You can press the sleeve back in, however it will seperate again after only a short period. When Delta was called they will replace the pully however it is on back order and a ship date is not known. If I could sell this press or get my money back and buy a Jet Press I would. This is one of the worst purchases in woodworking equipment that I have made."
1,BIG disappointment!!!,"I gave this drill a 1 and not a 0 because 1 is the lowest.Don't have exactly date when I bought, but it's around 2 or 3 years ago.Worked from time to time and it was OK. All together I think I must have used it maybe 20-30 hours and now, also here, the speed changing mechanism is gone.I can't describe it in details like others here did, but took it apart and after spending hours with a friend who knows machines, we couldn't find the problem. The handle used to change speed was stuck.Usually I buy very cautiously, read reviews, forums and so, this time it looked like a good reliable one, looking at the specs and the name Delta was OK. Should have done my homework. Writing here hoping to help someone else to avoid the mistake I did.I don't know what exactly to do, because every penny I will invest in it will be a penny down the drain. Maybe I'll sell it for parts (or give it for free to someone I really don't like) :-) and buy a ""real"" one."
1,Delta drill press dp350,"Piece of junk, so bad Delta will not stand behind it, had motor pulley blow apart, discontinue part along with the belt, and many other repair parts... Drill press is not that old and has limit use.... Do not purchase one...."
1,So sorry I bought it,"After assembling drill press, I turned it on it ran all of maybe two seconds before it threw the belt off. This was a reconditioned ""factory perfect"" unit. Table has a pin that is supposed to keep table at 90 degrees. Well it's off by a couple of degrees, it's very obvious. Table is not perpendicular to the column. The quality of this Chinese made tool is not what you would expect from Delta.I called Delta's customer service and with very little explanation was told they were a where of the problem and would send me a new belt, pulley and retainer clip. Well gee I didn't think I would have to start mechanicing on a brand new tool.Buyer beware, even at $159 it is too much."
1,Never A Delta Machine Again,"When i bought this drill press it was just what my husband wanted. Did not weigh to much and had the V S he needed for the different types of wood used. Everything worked fine for about 90 days. All of a sudden when starting up on day it started to make a terrible noise. The noise was relevant to the pulley system and and verable speed system. Tried to take it back to Lowe's where it was purchased,no deal not after 90 days. called Delta and was informed they were having trouble for over two years with the same problem. They have a 7 piece repair kit but they were in the process of moving to a new warehouse and could not send me the kit untill after May 5, 2005. Today is the 15th and nothing yet and All I get from Delta is put on hold. Save your money and buy a good drill press. No repair station within 175 miles. Thanks"
4,purchased as christmas gifts for two small kids.... will be perfect for their age.,this product was exactly what I was looking for. The kids they were purchased for are both under one year of age and this toy has no parts that could be considered dangerous to their well being. I was very pleased with this product and would recommend it for any child under the age of 5.
4,Bought for a ONE YEAR OLD'S BIRTHDAY,"When the 1 year old opened it I think she liked it, but we wouldn't know because the older sisters (3&4)snatched it up and carried it around like a baby the whole party. Soft & sweet, it does have Sweet Pea embroidered on the side. That's the only thing I don't like about this toy."
5,Love love love our Sweet Pea...,"My brother bought this for our daughter when she was a newborn, and it's become her favorite thing in the whole world! She has to have it when she goes to bed, tucks it under her arm, and she's out like a light... She especially loves the ""hair"" on top (which is really just made by two tags of orange ribbon), and she rubs it all the time. I'm going to get another one so that if/when we lose the Sweet Pea she currently has, our lives will not be over :o)Fantastic product--holds up well in the wash, is super durable, and has no small parts for babies who put EVERYTHING in their mouths. This great little doll is just perfect..."
4,The world as Indians saw it,"Ms. Swayne has done an excellent job of telling the story of one indian tribe's encounters with American explorers. Not really a portrayal of Lewis and Clark themselves, it is more a glimpse into what the world looked like to the Nez Perce 200 years ago. It's told from the Indians' point of view, based on oral and written history collected after much research by Ms Swayne. Each stage of the unfolding story is contrasted with entries from Lewis's and Clarke's journals. The different views of the same developments provides real insight into the different world views and problems faced by the Indians and the explorers.It's a fairly short book written in the style of a novel, and is a good relaxing read for adults or teenagers."
4,GREAT HOPE FOR BRITAIN!!!,"There is real music, good music being made in pop /rock circles these days. Having not been truly impressed in this respect since Oasis, I am thrilled to hear the likes of Maximo Park and The Futureheads. This album lives up to the expecctations of their recent singles and I hear they are great live as well, which will count heavily if they want to crack the states.Every song is a winner and I can only hope I get to see them live-hopefully soon!!"
2,They all can't be good.,Just can't find a rreason to like this album. Gave it a couple of tries but no go. Had faith in the overseas imports doing well but this fell into place with Athlete as something that flies over there but can't catch on here.
3,Wouldn't fit in my Kyocera phone properly,"This charger is small and sturdy, and looks as if you should be able to put some charge in a phone without much effort if it's working properly. But I got two different versions of the adapter tip for my Kyocera phone, and neither of them fit properly, so I was never able to get any use out of my charger."
5,yoga pants remain the same,I had some Danskin yoga pants for many years & they finally wore out. Of course I never thought I could get the exact same ones after so many years. Much to my delight I received these new ones & they were the exact same pant. Way to go Danskin--sticking with a good product.
5,TEENS LOVE THIS BOOK ... AND SO DO GRANNIES!,"David Field, the author, is very talented. Not only is this book alive with a wonderful plot, realistic characters, great dialogue, and unique twists and turns, it's also exciting, fun and memorable.And the little bit of appropriate ""romantic interest"" shown by the young teens in this book is very true to life. It's all innocent--hand-holding, sly glances, and kisses on the cheek of the opposite sex--is well-written, and absolutely acceptable in a quality book of this nature.Even though it's a fantasy, in writing it, Fields obviously thought things through. His style makes it easy for his readers to accept his perfectly sensible explanations when asking us to believe the impossible. In other words, he has the writing skill to make believers of all of us.My hat's off to this author. I love reading and writing for young people, and he just might be my new mentor!!! At least, his morals are ones I will definitely emulate."
2,ERICS WICKED CD.,"AFTER LISTEN TO THIS I WAS DISAPONTED. ITS NOT ONE OF E.B,S BETTER ALUBIMS TRY WICKED MAN OR BEFORE WE WERE RUDELY INTERUPPED."
5,Good product,This is a product that I have been using in addition to my adult one-a-day and it makes a perfert balance. The one-a-days have everything in them except a sufficient amount of calcium & magnesium. I also get it here for a good discount.
5,Great merchant!,Great product! Product does as advertised and is useful. And the price cannot be beaten. Will buy this product again!
2,Description is misleading,"I like NOW Vitamins, unfortunately the description did not mention that it has Vitamin D in it. I have to take prescription D so can't take this."
2,low budget... boring...,"Not worth buying, low budget movie and I kept waiting for something to happen.Not recommended. Not a horror movie it's more a suspense film."
1,Don't waste your money,"I too bought this for $5.00 at Walmart and even though it was only five dollars, I feel ripped off and actually angry...but you get what you pay for.These have got to be the worst horror movies that you could possibly imagine.The first movie looks very much like it was shot on someone's camcorder, Every film features really bad dialogue and absolutely horrible amateur acting.The films for me were so stupid that it was hard to sit through them and in some cases I couldn't even finish watching it until the end.It is not the kind of ""stupid"" as the movie, ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" which was a ""purposely funny stupid"" but the only other thing that I can tell you is that I would have more satisfaction in burning this dvd and flushing the ashes down the toilet than I would returning it and getting my money back."
5,Great fun for the entire family,This Pool set is awesome. It's Soooo Big! It can hold your entire family. Great for kids to learn to swim in. Great place to cool down on a hot summer day. Great place to even wash your dog.
1,Boring and Generic,"I can not believe people gave this video 5 stars. This series put my [kids] to sleep. This very poorly done, generic series is awful. The music is bad. This makes reading seem very boring. Please don't buy this for your children. Nothing beats Leap Frog Letter Factory and Word Factory videos. Stick to those."
5,Barn for HO Train lovers,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my nephew who has an HO train set. It arrived in a timely manner and my nephew liked it.
1,Poor Quality,"This product is very poor quality. After using it once, it would not hold air. I remember having fun on surf mats growing up, but I got no satisfation out of this product since it did not hold up to even one use."
2,poor quality,This float leaked within 5 minutes of inflating and before I ever got to the beach. I had to continually re-inflate while in the ocean. It is a great size and looks like a quality product but has poor construction.
3,Inner Seams Are The Problem,"Got 3 of these for spring break. The outer fabric is durable, the inflation valves didn't leak and the rope is nice. However, within one day of use the inner seams kept popping. In fact, 2 of them popped while they were just sitting on the beach without anyone even near them. They weren't over-inflated either...Just poor inner seams from a Made in China product. The kids did have $10 worth of fun from the rafts, but they became difficult for them to balance on once the inner seams started popping...So they didn't use them as much. I'll upload a photo to show how deformed they get with the popped seams. There's a reason these are only $10. If you accept that you're getting a lower quality product, then you won't be as disappointed when the product fails. Just don't expect several years (or even several days) of use from them..."
2,lunaire bra,ordered a 34DD like i usually wear and it was too tight. replaced it with a 36DD and the cups were too big. returned it for credit.
3,fatal flaw,"I have been wearing these sports bras for years and I love them, except for their one big flaw. The underwire quickly (sometimes after a couple of wearings, sometimes after a month or so) works its way out from under its plastic cap, and then pokes through the fabric and into the wearer's breast (big OW!). Alternately, if it comes uncapped on its inside-end, you can suddenly find it sticking out the neckline of a scoop-necked shirt (been there-- middle of the workday), but you're less-likely to be stabbed with it in this scenario.Other than that, the fit is good, the support is great and I like the appearance of them. I have successfully repaired a couple, cutting open the wire's channel, gluing the cap back on, and stitching them back up (yes, that's how much I like them), but that doesn't always work.If Lunaire can fix this one defect, it might become the perfect larger-size sports bra."
3,"Ok, but short range","I have had this thermometer for 4 months. It is pretty accurate, but the wireless range is less than 15ft and it is hard to tell if it has stopped updating. I tried to mount antennas on both transmitter and receiver by soldering a wire to the antenna circuits. It was a little better, but I am just using binoculars view the transmitter from inside from now on."
1,Big Disappointment,"Bought this for my husband for Christmas. The idea was that he could monitor the temperature inside the smoker AND the meat he was smoking, all from inside the house (less than 50' away.) Unfortunately, as soon as he was about 40' away from the smoker and just around the corner (still outside) it stopped working and he would have to reset everything. It did not work properly from day one. We thought we may have just gotten a bad unit and were going to ask for a replacement. Now we're told we can only get a refund - ""replacement unavailable."" Although we see that they are still for sale on Amazon.com (and $7 more!) I note other reviewers had to have one or more replacements. I recommend searching for a better brand."
2,"Some nice ideas, but poor implementation","This would be a solid thermometer for the price, except... it doesn't transmit further than 2 feet.At least mine doesn't, and I just got it yesterday. Apparently some of them work, because some of the reviewers are happy with theirs. But this one is a dud. I tried new batteries in both receiver and transmitter, and still can't it to transmit further. And this was outdoors -- no obstructions at all between the two.I like the features, and really wish it worked properly. But if I can't see the grill temperature from inside the house, then it's pretty much useless. I'll be returning it."
1,Receiver useless,Out of the box the receiver would only pull the temperature reading from the remote for about 10 min and then would lose the signal. This was from about 10-15 feet away. The remote sensor which is hooked up to the two probes still functions but the main attraction to this meter just doesn't work
2,They wouldn't ever communicate after initially turning on.,I had 2 issues with mine. Disappointing....-The 2 units would never communicate after the first time you turned them on. I even changed batteries. I guess you could just use the unit with probes without the receiver but that's why i aid for it.- The other issue was Temperature acuracy. it was a full 8-10 degrees off. I had 2 other reliable thermometers saying it was 144 and it said it was like 155I think im going to just return it....
1,Did not work,Returned it because the remote didn't work and you have to set the time every time you turn on the unit. Save your money
4,So far so good,"I just received it last weekend and decided to give it a try on a pork tenderloin. It worked great. I used one probe to give me the temp at grate level (the temp gauge that came with my smoker is 75 off) and one I put in the meat. It was easy to program how you wanted your meat cooked and when it gets to the desired temp the receiver beeps to let you know your food is done. You don't have to cut into the meat, to see if it is done, losing all the juices. The pork came out perfect.Be careful when you close the lid of your grill not to pinch the stainless-steel wires. They can be damaged and not work.I haven't tested how far apart you can go between the transmitter and the receiver. I only have to go 15' from my patio to my kitchen and it never missed a beat.05/28/07 - I have this thermometer in a pork shoulder right now. I used it yesterday in chicken quarters and a 4 lb pork loin. Everything came out perfect. This is a must have if you are going to smoke meat"
2,Remote check...I don't think so,"I bought this item to be able to monitor food temperature in my oven from my living room. What a joke! It drops the wireless connection even with less than 10 feet line of sight distance. Manufacturer said ""replace batteries"" so thinking the batteries in the box were old, I put in fresh batteries. It runs exactly the same. Other reviewers have made this same comment, but until I bought one I thought it was probably user error. It is product error!"
2,Didn't work quite right,"I had a lot of trouble getting the wireless signal to transmit from back probe connected device to the silver wireless receiver. Everything else worked just fine, but I purchased this particular one with hopes for a wireless connection so I think i'm going to try and return it."
1,Terrible,I ordered this thermometer based on what I thought was good reviews but this thing stinks. It takes forever to come up to temperature. I don't think it registers correctly. I wouldn't buy it again.
4,Almost...,"It does exactly what it is supposed to. A couple of comments that prevent giving it 5 stars:Even at a range of only 12 feet, I had to reset the transmitter and receiver a couple of times during a 4 hour slow cook.Could have had better instructions on the buttons on the front of the receiver.On the plus side, it did provide meat cooked exactly as set."
2,Review of Thermometer,"I purchased the thermometer through Amazon which has always been a good experience shopping. I have used the device 3 times so far and 2 times the probes acted funny and the 3rd time the device just would not read to the wireless device. I e-mailed Maverick and they seem very nice but the device has not performed like it should. It states that it works 100 feet away. I am lucky if I get 30 feet away. The device has some very cool features and the 2 probes is what really sold me, since I do a lot on my off set smoker grill. If they would extend the wireless reach and make a better product I would buy again. Disappointed in this product,"
2,Connection Issues,"I was initally happy with my purchase. The problem i have with this is the sync function between the two devices stopped working after only about 20 minuets of use. In the book it says it has up to 100 feet of coverage. I go from my smoker to my kitchen (about 10 feet and through a sliding glass window). 20 mins later and the grey part stopped giving me reading on my meat in the smoker. So i went back to the book so it can show me how to sync it back up. I did that and had a reading again. I go back to sit down in my kitchen and it happens again. I then sat next to this thing for about 15 mins and it did it again. Obviously this is not working as designed. Which makes me not happy with this product. Also, if you are using this with a PROQ or Weber Smokey Mountain (WSM) smoker, the probe will not fit through the eyelid that came pre-fab on your smoker, which is a bummer as well."
1,No wireless Range,"This had essentially no range for the wireless signal. Even 15 feet was too far for a connection, which makes this essentially useless as a wireless thermometer. I also did not like their buttons (the black horizontal stripes on the silver piece) - they were difficult to push - or more than they should be. Returning this to try to find one that will allow me to stand somewhere other than right next to the grill."
1,et-7,"one of the probs are burdt offf the first time i use it, and it was fore pulde pork so it was low and slow, the prob was sitting in the meat al the time and then after 15 hours it was broken, so this is the last time i bye a maverik"
2,Finnicky pain in the probe,Really a pain to use. Very touchy. Resets and loses contact too easily. More trouble than it is worth...more words...
1,Lousy,I should have stayed with a single probe model. The ET-7 cannot perform the most simple task. Transmitter and receiver at least six degrees off (when there is an actual temp displayed on the receiver). Internet forums on how to 'hack' this product shouldn't have to exist.
4,Receiver mal function. I think????,Over all I find this Thermometer very useful. I own a NewTemp remote thermometer for the same purpose. I find this unit much handier and eaasier to use.I.m only wondering why the receiver guit about 2.5 hrs into the cooking. I reset everything and it began to work again as advertized but it was an inconvirnce.The alarm is MUCH louder than the NewTemp and the probe lines seem more sturdy.Enjoy your new Maverick Thermometer !!!
4,Nice Thermometer,"This thermometer works great. I love the fact that I can walk away from the grill (Holland Grill) and just wait for the food to reach set temperature. The range of the receiver is not as good as stated, but it does work!"
2,Remote?,I have used this thermometer a couple of times now and found the same thing many others have reported. I works pretty good at about ten feet but past that or inside you can forget it. I checked both probes in boiling water and it's within a degree of what it should be. I mainly use a 55 gallon drum smoker and bought this so I didn't have to pop the lid until I had something done. I needed two probes so for what I needed it to do it works fine. Since the range is very limited I wish they had a plugin for both probes on the main unit. It only has one. If I had to do it over I would buy the Thermapen unit for $19.95.
1,PROBE SHORTS OUT AT COOKING TEMPERATURES,"WHY DO THEY MAKE AND SELL A TEMPERATURE PROBE THAT DOESN'T WITHSTAND COOKING TEMPERATURES???Main problem is that the probes are delicate and ""short out"" when cooking with a grill. Customer service tells me that the wire in the probe will melt when used in a grill and the temperature goes above around 400 degrees. I don't understand why they sell a probe for use on a grill that shorts out at that temperature. They have so many problems with this occurring that the FAQ on their web site talks about the unit displaying wildly inaccurate readings or just displaying ""LLL"" or ""HHH"" which occurs whent the probe ""shorts out.""WHY DO THEY MAKE AND SELL A TEMPERATURE PROBE THAT DOESN'T WITHSTAND COOKING TEMPERATURES???"
3,Is mine a lemon or am I expecting too much for $39...,I really wanted this thing to work. When I first got it the thermometer worked locally but the remote didn't reach all the way to our kitchen. It would work for a minute then the temps would freeze and I'd have to go reset the transmitter and receiver.Tried it again today because it's hot as hell outside and I didn't want to go out to check temps every 20 minutes. The probes are off from each other by about 20 degrees and I cannot even get a consistent signal to our den which is the closest room to the bbq. I am resorting to binoculars to see the built in gauge on my smoker. It's a much less hi-tech solution but way more reliable and infinitely less frustrating.
4,works well,I love this product! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the instructions were difficult for me to understand. Once I figured it out all was well. Works as advertised.
1,poor quality,i purchased this in febuary and hardly had a chance to use it before this summer i used it maybe 10 times when i went into the house it lost contact with the receiver.this past weekend main unit froze up and wont work i read the inst and it only comes with a 90 day warrantee. what a rip off
1,Off by several degrees,"My unit was badly off. I only realized after a couple of uses. When I tested the calibration both thermometers were off by about 4 degrees, resulting in undercooked meet the two times I used it. Also, the instructions are difficult to follow, as mentioned in other reviews."
1,Up to 100ft is misleading,"This product would be great if it could transmit through windows or walls. The unit I received couldn't reliably transmit to the receiver 10 feet away inside my house. Unfortunately I'll be returning this item for one that actually works. If you are just using the product for the two probes and don't care about the transmitter distance, it's a great buy for the price."
1,POS - don't believe it works as stated!,"Well after sending the first one back and getting another I can see it's a 'feature' to not work beyond 15 ft. (and especially through any material). This was painfully obvious when first using the unit, and really being fascinated at first... seemed to be working good... I had meat in the smoker... and it was getting hotter...I was actually seeing temp updates... then after not paying attention for a few minutes, I checked and the temps were way hotter than the reciever reported - since it hadn't gotten any updates from the xmitter!! ARGH! And eventually a 'loss of lock' was obvious. So much for sitting in the house and watching the temps! At least the transmitter unit seems to register the temps correctly so if you chuck the reciever in the trash, you still have a nice digital readout - sans remote. Buyer beware!"
1,Wireless doesnt work well,"I'm disappointed that the wireless didn't really work. It's a struggle to get it connected, and then difficult to keep it connected. the base station shows the temps by alternating the two, I just tossed the wireless receiver."
1,I really wanted this to work...,"I love the features of this product, namely the dual probes and the fact that you can see the probe temps on both the remote and the control units. However, the range was abysmal, as noted in several other reviews here. Abysmal as in it loses signal after about 10 feet through glass windows and doesn't alert you to this fact. It also only updates a few times per minute even when it is working, which is frustrating when you're trying to determine whether or not it's actually working.I've ordered an Oregon Scientific unit as a replacement and have high hopes as a friend has one of those and it works perfectly, albeit without the 2nd probe or the ability to see the temp on the ""outside"" unit."
4,MAVERICK WIRELESS THERMOMETER WITH 2 PROBES,"Have used this device of years. Over all satisfactory. Not extremely accurate but lnforms me when I need to go to a thermometer that is instant and more accurate. When using in an outside cooker, i cover the probe wires with foil, therefore they last MUCH LONGER."
5,Maverick ET-7 Remote-Check wireless Thermometer with 2 Probes,"I have used both probes simultaneously smoking loins of Canadian Bacon and a full Loin of beef on the BBQ. The thermometer was easy to setup, install and monitor. At this point in time I'm ecstatic with the results."
2,don't see it too long and boring,This movie was boring they prolonged it for so long what made it so boring not enough action. More talking then anything. If you like poor animation and the characters talking alot and not enough action then this is the one for you our if you like old animations.
3,Some trail descriptions not accurate,"This is a nice reference if you'd like a list of the trails in the area. Many of the trail descriptions are confusing, and the mileages listed are incorrect. When the author describes the ""round-trip"" mileage, it is usually the one-way mileage. Sometimes the listed mileage is simply incorrect. Seems like the author may not have been on many of these hikes recently or at all."
3,Perhaps Series Has Run Its Course,"I think this will be the last edition of the Guide that I purchase. While there are a number of problems, two stand out for me. The first is that there are an awful lot of CDs listed that are simply unavailable. For example, I've never been able to locate the Papa Celestin/Sam Morgan CD on the Azure label. But there it is, edition after edition. Never mind that the material has been available for some years on the Jazz Oracle label. And this is a crown CD! The second major problem is that many of the star ratings don't match the text. One of the most glaring examples is the Chick Corea CD, The Ultimate Adventure, which is given four stars. However, the text utterly pans it.While I have great admiration for the authors, I believe this project has just become too much for two and now one man. It had its day but I feel that day has passed."
1,Jazz is African,"Jazz is African. Jazz music comes from a place -an exclusive reality marked by poverty and anti bourgeoise values. It is unfortunate that all the jazz festivals and audiences are bourgeois. Their commercial values will never be able to purchase jazz-African. They will only understand the commericial values and not the true essence of Jazz- African music. For Africans, music has always been an expression of our exclusive and dire reality. Caucasians will never understand it because it is simply not thier reality of commercialism, debauchery and intemperance. long live non bourgeois, non commercial African jazz."
3,Jensen Ackles!,"I only bought this because of Jensen Ackles, but he deserves much better roles though, since he's an awesome actor!"
1,"Devour is one for the skeet shoot. Pull, release and shoot it!!!!","On his birthday, Jensen Ackles (Smallville, Supernatural) gets a surprising birthday gift. His friends hook him up into a website called ""The Pathway"" a game where they call you and you tell them what to do and they get it done for you. Suddenly, bodies pile up and nothing is what it seems for Mr. Ackles as he goes down a path which leads to the end where of course for me it was obvious who it was predictable. Sad sad horror wanna be delivers no goods and a wast of a perfectly good cast, well Shannyn Sossoman (40 Days and 40 Nights, The Order) and Dominique Swain (Face/Off, Lolita) arent that good of actresses anyway. Also starring William Sadler (Demon Knight, Die Hard 2), Teach (Limp, Fierce People), Martin Cummins (Ice Men, Just Candy), Alan Ackles (Hexed, Walker, Texas Ranger) and Rob Stewart (Two of Hearts, The Pawn). No fun to be had here only mind numbing boredom."
3,Nothing to write home about,"I purchased this DVD because of Jensen Ackles. I thought I would give it a chance because of all the unfavorable reviews. If you are a Jensen Ackles fan, you might want to purchase this just because. If you are a fan and want a movie with substance, you might want to skip it.The acting was fine. I believe Jensen Ackles is a terrific actor and hope he can find a movie that will make people see what his fans already do but this movie will not be it. It was lacking substance and was slow in many areas. The special effects were very good and the ""tongue scene"" was gross.I am almost disappointed that I purchased this movie as opposed to renting it. I tried to rent it but my local video store didn't even carry it. Oh well. I'll have something to look back upon whenever Supernatural is in it's 5th season! (I'm hoping!)"
5,Don't Let this one Go!,"This CD is fantastic. It's a vivid account of a story that anyone who's launched an honest search for truth will both marvel at and relate to in a way that feels incredibly personal. Truly, it's a story I WISH I could claim as mine, but I wasn't nearly as thorough, or as amusing. You'll laugh out loud at things you never thought could be funny. I downloaded it to my iPod and listened at the gym. I had to really fight not to look like the resident crazy. I bought copies for several friends for Xmas and my popularity is at an all time high. Buy this and enjoy!!"
5,My 14 mo. old loves it!,"I bought this book for her when she was 10 months old. At that time she didn't ""get it"" and I had to pull the tabs out for her. But at 13 mos. she figured it out and she loves pulling the tabs and seeing the different animals! I think the Slide'N'Seek is a great concept for little hands and there's no way she can tear the tab out of the book (she can tear a flap easily). Perfect for the 12-24 mo. age range. I've bought her the rest of the series for Christmas. I just wish there were more board books like this out there!"
5,Killer Cats In San Francisco,"Writer Shields has produced an exciting read based on an intriguing premise. Animals released into the wild is a neat notion, however wild animals who have developed a taste for human blood or a willingness to come where the hunting is easy.... fenced back yards filled with trapped pets and kids are not likely to relish being released into an area where they have to search for food and fight with others for territory."
4,A Handy Tool,"We are getting closer to moving and I'll want to check room sizes when looking at homes we might consider. This tool can very quickly measure a room and you can quickly sketch the layout and add length and width as you walk around looking. This would be nice for later comparisons. I found that ceilings will not measure well because of lack of solidity of the material. It can place a laser circle of dots on the far wall so you see where it is measuring, the measurement is made sonically!I am impressed with the tool - you add 4.25 inches to the dimensions (length of the tool). Max length for measuring is 50 ft - but it has a setting to add two lengths measured to get a longer measurement."
5,Great for public meetings,"This mic is just plain great for meetings. I am a public official on a government board with 8 other members. Each Board Member has one of these mics which feeds the PA system. I find it very sensitive, the on-off switch reliable, and the quality is good. My opinion is ""Highly Recommended"""
5,Very nice!,"This is a great hydration pack for rides of a couple of hours or less. It keeps the water nice and cold, and the 50 oz. pack is light enough to not bother me while riding. Highly recommended!"
2,I Purchased this for 1 Song & had no idea!,I only heard 1 song on the radio of this artist and I loved it that's why I purchased this album. What I didn't know is that this CD is truly for a special demographic (Weird). I really dislike the other songs on this CD they are depressing. To give you an example; I was playing this CD at night to lull me to sleep and next thing I know I woke up to this one tune playing crying. It was that song it was making me sad in my sleep and woke up crying. Enough said.
3,"Surprisingly enough, Corsten does NOT impress as a DJ","Ferry Corsten is a trance wizard, very high-energy, and a very skilled remixer/producer, but this album falls short of what most might expect. Although the track selection is impeccable, and his own remixes of many an anthem are mind-blowing, Corsten is just a mediocre DJ. The album feels paced too quickly, like he's rushing through both cd's, and frankly I think his live sets sound the exact same way - so I think that's just the way he performs and mixes when wearing his DJ hat.It's a fun, HI-NRG compilation, but not recommended for the seasoned progressive enthusiast. Highly recommended for those new to Trance and progressive House."
4,Jones's Review,"The unit works as advertised. Since I live in a rural area, I had no trouble finding unused FM frequencies. The entire FM frequency spectrum is programmable, but only three ""quick pick"" buttons are available. The sound is more than adequate. The iPod works best with the volume maxed out. The bass is over emphasized with ""bass boost"" on. I used ""bass reduce"" and adjusted it back with the radio controls. Treble is fine. For the price, it's an awesome unit!"
1,doesn't work,"I live in san diego, and I meticulously searched every station and couldn't find one on the entire dial that would work without static."
3,Better than most but....,This was the 4th FM transmitter I have tried and it was the only that came close to working. What I have noticed is for vehicles with rear mounted antennas seem to have a harder time picking up the signal. We tried virtually every frequency and never got a solid signal. This was the only one where you could actually make out the music. I have tried it in my 2006 Toyota Corolla and 2007 Kia Rondo.
4,Good for the price,"I bought this for my work car so I can listen to my ipod when I am driving. I wasn't expecting much...But, it really surprised me!...It actually works quite well. Sure, I have had encountered static when I go into some areas which are transmitting on, or close to my stored frequency, but I can easily change to one of the other stored frequencies. Much better than other ones I have tried...Not a bad item at all..."
1,not good,my music can never play in my car. The radio stations always take over. And its hard to get the monster to change stations.
1,It Melted....,"2010 - When it worked, it was great. On a hot August day it melted and no longer works. At least it did not start any fires. I would not leave it plugged in if I were you......I use this with a Sansa Fuze (and later an IPOD).Turns out that the normal channel I set this to is a radio station somewhere South. When plugged in, the RadioPlay over powers the distant station. This thing works and works well. Since it overpowers the station, I leave it where it works and don't worry about it. I did have to change it that time we drove to Chicago though.Three buttons to assign a station to and any channel. No restrictions on what channel you choose to set the transmitter to.The only thing I can pick about is that the other buttons on the transmitter get pushed when I set something on the control or the wife sits on it."
3,Works ok,"I got one of the Radio Play 300s and it worked pretty well then all of a sudden made a popping sound and stopped working. Returned it to Monster with no problem. The one they sent back to me works ok, but I still think a tape converter sounds better. I guess I wouldn't either recommend it or discourage you from getting one."
2,Monster RadioPlay 300 Universal Full Spectrum FM Transmitter (MBL-FM XMTR300),"It's ok. It works, but not to my liking. It does work better than another much more expensive one I tried, but still to much static. Probably not going to use it."
5,Works Great!,Great product - works well when traveling in the car with my Mp3. Only downside is hunting for radio stations to tune in when traveling to different areas. Don't do this while driving!
4,Impressed,This is the fifth FM transmitter I have tried since I got my ipod 3rd gen. The first three I tried in my Ford Expedition had static at unacceptable levels (I consider these transmitters high end by price). With that I used a cassette adapter which worked very well until the cassette player quit. I then tried a Griffin iTrip LCD Dock Connector which has such a weak transmission I had to turn the volumes all the way up and it stll was not loud enough. The Monster RadioPlay 300 was the last transmitter I was going to try before changing out the radio and the RadioPlay worked well beyond my expectations even with Expedition antenna in the right rear window. It's still not as good as a direct connection and an angle plug would have been nice.
3,Almost Perfect Product,"After receiving the Monster Radio Play 300, I installed it in my 2002 BMW 525i. I was able to install the product where everything is hidden and I spliced in an auxiliary jack that is mounted flush into the dashboard.I would love to give the product 5 stars except there is still intermittent hiss or static depending on where I am driving. Even after I change the frequency on the unit and radio, I still get the noises.I use the car on the weekends only, my weekly car already has an auxiliary cable built in to the factory radio, so I experience no background noises. My other option would have been to purchase the dice unit costing about 4 times as much. With the dice unit I would lose the CD player and reading some of the reviews, it looks like the unit needs to be reset periodically and the unit is in the trunk of the car.For my purposes the monster unit is sufficient."
1,Does Not Work!,Product did not work as described. It turned on but the sign was so weak that you can barely here any sound. I tried multiple frequencies but no luck. You have to max the volume to hear and the sound quality is very poor.
1,Started out good but failed,"Bought this product to replace an existing one that was eight years old. Previous one died as its cords failed.New one worked great for a while, but started becoming staticky all the time. Is now worthless. After reading reviews on all other brands, I will not bother to waste more of my money. Would NOT recommend this product to anyone."
5,Very clear sound,I am quite impressed with this product. Very clear sound. Easy to use. No quality issues at all.
2,Great until it Quit,"This product is great - gets hold of a station and keeps it. However after a few months, it has started to heat up and quits. After cooling off it starts again and sometimes last for an hour and quits again. Consequently, it is not usable."
4,Good and easy,Good and easy to use...I bought it again after using the first one for 2 year.Cable at headphone jack can be disconnected when pluggin it into the device whose headphone jack is located on top of device....
1,Good name. Bad results,I bought this pretty much because of the Monster name. It had static everywhere on every station. I live in an area with plenty of free stations. Refund!
2,Doesn't Work In Houston,"In all fairness, I read other reviews before ordering this product and I had my doubts that it would work well in a big city with a crowded FM radio dial.Nonetheless, I thought I'd give this model a try because, unlike other similar units, it can be tuned to any FM frequency. As promised, it was also easy to tune and set up the three preset channels.I tried, unsuccessfully, to find a frequency that was far enough away from another station to get a quiet signal. Then I tried again. And again. I had no luck so I sent it back."
4,Not what I expected,"Apparently the transmitter is powered by the car charger-like port. It doesn't work when it's not in a car outlet. I kinda wanted something that could work everywhere. Still a good transmitter, but losses a star for transportability."
1,Order did not arrive!!!,The order did not arrive and no refund was returned. Please be careful when ordering.
3,works ok,"This product works OK except the signal can get fuzzy sometimes, which is pretty annoying. I would say you get what you pay for with this product."
1,Does't work,Pros: NoneCons: Cheap plastic constructionComplex way to set up radio frequencyReally cheap plastic constructionAlso does't work properlyIt's going back.
1,Stay away from it.,The Monster RadioPlay 300 FM Transmitter (MBL-FM XMTR300) is hardly useable. It works but with intermittent noise in the raidio. very annoying.
2,Terrible for CO residents,This transmitter is the worse I have ever use. But I have a feeling of living in the mountains(CO) also might have an effect on it too. The sound quality has static in every station I turn to. and it doesn't have a synchronizing button where u can hit for the thing to search your area for a better reception dial. The transmitter makers have no vision....I an very disappointed and wasting almost 40 dollars for something like this in this economy.
3,Just OKAY; there is better,"I have had many ipod tranmitters. Years ago, they all sucked wind. Today, there are only 1-2 (that I have found) work very well and none (yet) that work excellent. This one (again, from my experiance) has dead-spots between freq's. When traveling (+/- 60miles), I have to change from one to the other -- always. The time to switch is self-evident since the static tells you and it tells you as pleasently as a snooze alarm. Check this one out; more freq's, less (if any)switching around: <http://www.amazon.com/Monster-iCarPlay-Wireless-Transmitter-Charger/dp/B00019068G/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1270134336&sr=1-15>"
3,"Very ""Manualish,"" but Not Bad Overall","This book is written as you would expect it to be - like a textbook. However, it is very good at conveying how to survive in the wilderness. If you do a lot of camping, and want to try something different, buy this book and see if you can do as it says.It's a bit on the thick side, but it's also everything you'd expect in a manual written by the U.S. Army."
2,BURNS!,"Pros: Minimizes Pores, Easy To UseCons: Burns, Irritates Skin, Dries Out SkinI would not recommend this to a friend.I have tried everything from expensive Organic Natural products,Proactive (which burns as well), Antibacterial soaps, no soap, Dove...Saw this on sale, figured I'd give it one last shot before my dermatologist appointment.First day I thought it was working2nd Day Huge cluster breakout on cheek, burnt around my eyes, red burns and irritation on my neck and chest.3rd Day all my zits are drying out, but it is still incredibly painfulAm hoping once all my zits clear up the pain will go away...will give it a few more days and see.Can't go out to gym in morning without make up because of the extreme redness on my face and neck :O("
2,needs a warning that it bleaches your shirts and bedding,"So far so good, I can see an improvement of my acne (under my chin) using this product, but as I woke up after applying it on my second day I saw my t-shirt on the mirror and its collar was totally bleached !"
1,Awful for skin!!!!!! Does not work!,"Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and ""day cream"" burn and sting when you apply. Also you can't realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won't, benzoyle peroxide is awful for yous skin and known to cause thin skin and premature aging. As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing! I have cystic acne and it works. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side try Aztec healing clay, does wonders. :)"
2,"Really, Amazon?","Usually I can depend on Amazon to provide me with a reliable product when I order directly from them (and not a third party). All AcneFree products were included but the label to the Toner was written in Spanish and English. Random words were Spanish but majority of the wording was in English. Makes me think that this product was purchased from a discount merchant (like Ross) and resold for full value on Amazon.Not usually highly disappointed in Amazon, but am this time."
3,worked pretty good,It wasn't magic but it was better than other products that our daughter had been using. We'd buy it again but I don't know that I'd argue that you should buy it.
2,it burned me,I put it on last night and again this morning. A few minutes later it started stinging around my eyes. When I looked in the mirror and all around my eyes was deep red. I washed it all off as soon as possible. But it still stings and is very red.
2,It didn't work,"I was really hoping for something that would work, but unfortunately, this set up is complicated, and after all that, just doesn't work. It did dry my face out, however."
1,MAKES ACNE WORSE!!!!,"I have suffered with mild acne since I have graduated high school. Once I started breaking out, I began using the original acnefree kit. It made my skins worse, but I still gave it a try. Now that my acne became severe, I decided to go a step up and get this product. This product has left me with red skin, bad acne, and more acne scars. To add up, the only this product has done is bleach my hair and clothes. this product smells really bad! Dont get this product expecting hope, cuz i bet these positive comments about it are from paid spokespeople."
1,OH! My Aching Head!,"How did this movie ever make my local video store shelf? I too, love ""B"" movies, but this one left me in shock! Are we to take this flick seriously? One question..........how did Rhino keep that toy car under that poncho as he traveled through the jungle fighting off armies of little men dressed like cavemen??? What about the scene where the armies run out in pairs and stand with their backs to the camera looking at the forest?? My mouth was hanging open throughout this film, trying to figure out if it was a martial arts movie or a comedy. I told my son that he was in for a thrill when he watched it after me. He's the one that paid the 50 cents to rent it anyway. I liked the other reviews and laughed when I read them too."
1,read discription carefully,"with this item i was dissapointed, u must read the discription carefully because the pictured item is not what you receive. the inlet is not centered as in the picture but offset as it says in the description which isnt that much of a problem but can potentially cause too much stress on ur pipe or hangers if ur set up is made for a centered inlet. this just taught me to always pay attention to the little stuff. and that ppl will just take a random picture of a simmilar product and put it on alot of different products. hope this helps."
2,Retarded yet fun wanker Rockabilly,The Rev. Horton Heat did it better. But then again every city needs some doofus with a pompadour roaming around in biker boots to sing retarded whiteboy rockabilly or blues ripoffs while drunk for a good time.
3,mediocre soul album,"Beverlei has a good voice and is a well known background singer. Unfortunately the quality of the songs aren't that good, so the album is only mediocre. It's more like radio-music"
3,Quirky,I found this book by searching for Christopher Moore. Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom was very quirky with characters much like ones you will find in Christopher Moore's titles. I will definitely look up more of A.L. Haskett's work.
3,Fun,"This was a light, definitely entertaining enough to read, but not something that you would read twice type of a story."
1,If you are in the top 1% income bracket...,"..Then this is the book for you. The author says there are some things you just don't try to save on-'last year's Prada shoes are better than this year's Nine-West', and other important distinctions. She even advises you on how to save money by packaging your own parcels for the Post Office.For those of us in the other 99%, I think we're looking for more practical advice. To the author- you can save money by cutting your child's hair. There are fantastic videos at the public library that show you how do it.For me-a wasted inter-library loan (I borrow rather than buy first)."
5,Audio-Technica AT-LP2DA LP-to-Digital Recording System,"I think both items, the turntable and software, are great. I had some trouble connecting the turntable to my computer, but it was my mistake--it needed to be plugged into the back of the computer, not the front.As far as the software is concerned, I don't have a problem with it. I'm recording my LP's to CD--just the songs I like, so I'm not recording the whole album--and the software works great.For the money, I think this a great product."
5,Good Product,"I thought the instructions were okay. At very least, they laid the foundation to operating the different functions of the turntable and software. Tech support is good too. Had trouble activating the mp3 converter but it was resolved quickly. Have had no trouble with it since. Would recommend it to anyone."
3,No USB Connection,"I bought the turntable because it said that it included everything you needed to hook up to your computer. That was not quite accurate since it only has RCA connectors, and will not hook up to a notebook computer through the USB connector. The product seems like a good idea, and it was a good price, but not what I needed."
3,Disappointed,The turntable connections are limited and the software that came with the turntable did not load properly on Windows XP. Cakewalk Pyro5 also cannot be used with Windows ME.
4,LPs to MP3s,"I bought this product for my husband. He had some trouble with the software interface, but perservered. Once he figured out the problems with the software, he was able to get it to work. (A day of growling at his computer.) He now is taking 1 LP a night and converting it to MP3 so he can listen to his old music on his iPod. The process is somewhat slow, so he can only do 1 LP per evening - but he's ecstactic!"
5,Watch out Bratz!,"I LOVE the My Scene Dolls! I have all of them including Nolee! I think these dolls are better than the Bratz because they are prettier, bigger, have more clothes, have actual feet and don't even cost a lot! I took advantage of the Easter sale and completed my collection. This doll is cool even for ages up to 14 ( i think). I'm twelve and dont even like barbies but these are so cool!"
3,A good beginner's summary of Kubrick's work,"This book reads more like summaries of Kubrick's films than either analysis, or indepth reviews. It might be useful to anyone beginning to explore Kubrick's body of work, or anyone interested in having a mini-encyclopedia of cliff notes. Be warned that the book contains notes on all of the endings to Kubrick's films, so if you do not wish to ruin the endings, perhaps you shouldn't read it."
1,Who the heck is this Kagan fellow??!!,"Not particularling illuminating or informative, at the very least it collects portions of commentaries from some of the best film critics (eg Pauline Kael). Beyond this there is not much positive to say. Often Kagan can't even provide accurate summaries of Kubrick's films (one example is that he confuses the identities of the condemned men in Paths of Glory, and this effectively renders his thematic analysis of that film useless!). Kagan also seems to miss the entire point of certain films. One wonders why he even bothered writing such a book."
5,Slow Dance Music,"Wonderful songs, very romantic and wistful. Their rendition of""I Will"" is the best I've ever heard, and the other songs are tremendous."
4,interesting topic & wonderful new author,I was very interested in reading this book when I heard of it. I was born and raised a Catholic and enjoy reading books of all topics about my faith and I especially love true crimes.....my husband is a police officer! So when I saw both areas of interest twisted together in one book I was fascinated!! I really enjoyed this book and this authors writing style! He masterfully captured this priest and his crimes with such imagery.....as I read the book I could envison what was taking place and I kept thinking this book would make a great movie!I hope to see more books by this author!
5,Excellent,"This is one of Thalia's best productions, I love her voice in Closer to you, it's a great song. Keep it up Thalia"
5,A GREAT ACTION THRILLER!!!,THIS MOVIE STARRING THE BEAUTIFUL ALEXANDRA HOLDEN IS A GREAT ACTION/THRILLER. NOT A LOT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS AND NO LARGE BUDGET...BUT NOT A BAD MOVIE!! CHECK IT OUT!!
5,"The Greatest ""Artist"" of All Time!","""2 Whomever it May Concern, u must come to your senses, there are no KINGS on this earth only PRINCEs"". ""His name is PRINCE & HE IS FUNKY""!As always, Prince has remained true to his name. He never ceases to amaze me. I remember watching the Gett OFF vhs when it first dropped in '91, in complete awe! And even in 2002, this is certainly a masterpiece. This CD is a funky,""LOVESEXYMUTHA"".To all the Purple People in this world, if you don't own it, buy it, you will ""GETT OFF"" to ""VIOLET THE ORGAN GRINDER""!Peace & Be Wild......................"
4,Pretty Good,"I have this doll and it is great but whats with the arms,knees,and waist.You should definetly get this doll but its waist is srange!Anyway Bryant is cute and relly is a good mach for Madison or Chelsea. Get Him."
2,Liftmaster 3200 Professional - screw drive,"Sounds like most everyone install their own garage door openers. I would have preferred to do that, just not enough time. Anyway, I had to replace a screw type Genie that was 20 yrs old. The Genie was so quiet and smooth, it was hardly noticed, too bad it quit raising the door. I had a new Liftmaster 3200 Professional - screw drive, installed by ""professionals"". This opener is VERY noisy, it bounces up and down, and twists the rail while it's pulling the door up. I was told it was ""better"" than a Genie ... my experience says don't believe it. ( suppose the installers may have done a poor install). Still, I wish I had replaced the Genie with another Genie and done it myself. A $350 lesson."
1,Poor reception!,"We purchased this monitor as it had both the video that we could keep next to the bed and the sound monitor that we could carry around. The video monitor is a piece of junk! Our house is only 1700 square feet and we cannot see the picture if you are more than one room away. Also, it gets a lot of static and becomes very loud with static during the night. I've been woken up more by the static that I have by my babies cries! The portable sound monitor seems to work well, except the batteries fall out very easily. If you just shake it a little, the batteries fall out and then they have to be reinstalled. Unfortunatley, we received this 2 months before baby was born and didn't use it for teh first three months, since he was next to us in a bassinet. I didn't save the box or the receipt. If I had, I would be taking it back. My advice is to test out any monitor you buy before you destroy the receipt or the box!"
3,Good at first,"I had recieved it as a shower gift and at first it worked great, the night vision was the best. However after about 6 mo of use the night vision no longer worked, I would advise anyone willing to spend this kind of money on a monitor to spend it elsewhere, especially due to the length of time the thing actually works."
2,2.4 GHz was much better,"We bought the 2.4GHz version of this monitor last November when my daughter was born and absolutely loved it. We had to send it back when the infrared night vision lights went out (customer service was great by the way) and they had changed to the 900Mhz version. The 900MHz monitor has terrible reception in our house. We get almost no picture two rooms away. I would say that it might be because we have 900Mhz phones, but we bought the Summer Infant 900Mhz monitor and get a great picture. I really still love the 2.4 version the best and would buy it again in a heartbeat if they ever make in again."
2,Not as good as the 2.4 GHz with TV inside,"First I purchased the 2.4 GHz monitor with TV inside. It seems to be work great. We still didn't try it on baby (I'm due next week) though, but we did try it in dark room and with both our laptops working with wireless internet. Then I saw this model and liked the idea of wireless sound monitor (that comes as a bonus). So I bought this one too to try. Well, the quality is not even close. The picture is awful, ""snow"" all over. And it doesn't have a TV inside, which can be nice in future. BTW, TV works great!So my husband already returned the new one (900MHz) and I'm keeping my ""old"" one (2.4GHz).My 2 cents - try both of them and see what is good for your house and for your telephones and computers.Good luck."
3,Infrared has a Short Life,"The infrared has died on me once on this camera and twice on the Sight and Sound model before this one. And the video monitor died on this model. All of this within 3 years. Also, a friend of mine has the same model and his infrared has died twice. However, the picture is great and audio has very little interference. Also, the company did a great job of replacing the defective parts at no cost during the warranty period. Bottom line: great video and audio, but be prepared for it to die young."
1,Beware of Safety First,"We bought the 2.4 GHz Child View Monitor and absolutely loved it. Unfortunatly, the LED lights went out and when I contacted the company I was informed that they could only relpace it with this newer less appealing model. The 900 Mhz will interfere with my cordless phones and there is no TV. I loved the TV! I would watch it while folding laundry or waiting for my daughter to fall asleep before I went to bed. To get the replacement, I have to send back bits and pieces to prove that it is destroyed. So I couldn't keep my TV anyway which seems like an awful waste. I am really dissapointed with this company and urge others to beware before entering into a dysfunctional relationship with Safety 1st!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This product was a replacement for the other Safety 1st monitor that broke. I got it in February and about 3 weeks ago the sound doesn't work until you hit the top of it and now the on button has to be pushed several times before it goes on. To top it off, the Safety 1st company is doing nothing for me. Talk about good consumer relations! They said my warranty ran out from my first product that broke. Which by the way I mailed back to them at my expense! What a bunch of bull! Please do not waste your money. I will never buy a product from Safety 1st again!"
1,Replaced five times and it still did not work!,"I received this video monitor as a gift and loved it at first. Within a month of installing it, the camera stopped working. I had to send the entire unit back before Safety 1st would send a replacement. I received a replacement within about a week. For about 2 weeks I got great reception with a clear picture and then all of a sudden the reception on the new monitor just died. This same thing happened with 3 more replacment units before I finally just returned the entire thing to Babies R Us and purchased the Summer's Infant Video Monitor. I have had it for approx. 6 weeks and love it."
3,"good picture for me, hissy sound","We received this as a gift hooked it up last week and I have no problems with the picture at all, even in the dark. The sound has a definate background (annoying) hiss but the lights for sound level work fine and are sensitive. I'd love it (5 stars) if I could get rid of that hiss. I plan on trying a few friends audio monitors to see if its this monitor or just a high 900mHz background in our house. Credit to the manufacturer for the packaging- near imposible to open without destroying packaging making trying before buying difficult (hard to return in a ripped up box)."
2,The monitor doesn't work,"I bouht this item last september, and I lived in Brazil.Well, the problem is.. 2 weeks after I am using the monitor, it stops to work, and I don't know what to do, because nobody here knows where can I find a place to replace that.Someone can help me?"
2,Stopped working after 15 months,"Our monitor officially stopped working 2 days ago. We will replace it with another brand, b/c we find it very reassuring to see the baby at night and check on him w/o opening the bedroom door. The monitor's plug is a huge and bulky square that gets hot when plugged in. The plug seems to be the reason the monitor is not working because when we adjust it and hold it into the outlet the picture appears for short bursts of time. However, once it is let go, the unit is out again. I was surprised it only worked for a little over a year. I would not recommend purchasing an expensive product like this only to have to replace it in a short period of time. Also, the heat from the plug seems dangerous."
1,Not much good,"Used this for a week monitoring my son in the adjoining room.Reception was OK - but the quality of picture was extremely bad. During the day the picture quality was like watching a 1960's TV - which is OK - it's only a $[...] piece of electronics. But in a dark room at night, the picture provided is so poor that you can't see anything. While the camera claims to have night vision, it doesn't provide anything that comes close.So if you need something that works at night (which is sort of the whole purpose of a monitor) then this product won't do the trick. I returned this product."
3,Great while it lasted,This was fantastic for about a year. Our hand-held sound only receiver had to be replaced after a year because it no longer had sound. The video monitor has been slowly fading since about 15 months and no longer provides a picture. After reading reviews I think Safety 1st is intentionally producing a defective product that falls apart immediately after the warranty expires....
3,Initially awesome product....,"Initially I was absolutely delighted with this monitor and like others have said, it was a life saver. Our daughter's bedroom is on the main level and our bedroom is upstairs. With that being said, after about 3-4 months of using it the night vision went out completely. I returned it to Babies R Us with minimal problems. They tried to sell me a 6 month warranty for it and I said I shouldn't have to buy a warranty for a $150 item that has only been used for a few months. So the replacement monitor just went out as well. I tried to return this one to Baies R Us as well today where they gave me the manufacturers phone number. That's it, no exchange, credit nothing. They asked if I had the box and I replied why would I keep the box if it worked when I got it? So 2 monitors within less than a year? I have a 14 month old and am 7 months pregnant. Who has time for this kind of crap? So yes, while it works it is awesome.....but seems like overall product is lacking."
5,I REALLY enjoyed this book,"This book suprised me. It is very well written, and has a captivating storyline. I enjoyed it from start to finish."
4,Closely accurate description.........,"This book does a very good job of stating most of the facts surrounding the two famous hacker groups MOD and LOD. It adds a hint of drama to try and keep the reader but is basically a description of events. I thought it was well written and knowing most of what went on back then could vouch for the books accuracy. In terms of how each of the characters involved thought, the writer threw in their own opinions, but the timeline of events was pretty much on the money. If you are interested to read a bit about how some of the more well known historic events about hacking, I suggest you read this book. I found it enjoyable throughout its entirety."
3,ac delco?,Not sure if AC delco box was wrong and thermostat had no marking on it. It is working good. 3 months now.
4,Very good read,What I liked about the book was the pace and the availability of the characters. Meaning there were no long pauses to set a scene or over description of the characters. I found that I was very captivated with the the characters. You just enough information on each one to judge for yourself their personalities. Tori Maxwell(main character) was engaging and you understood her dilimma and the outcome of her decisions. I found the book very delightful despite a few words that were misused but this was very minor. Also the title did not grab me but that goes to say read the synopsis before you make your decisions. I strongly reccomend as a must read and an addition to your liteary library. Bravo to the author Brey.
2,I Still Get Streaks,"Not much better than ordinary Windex. If you really want no streaks on your windshield, get a real automotive glass cleaner like Armorall, RainX, or Invisible Glass."
3,Beautiful,"This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous. I was going to a wedding, and I wanted to wear black jewelry, so I purchased this bracelet. It went perfectly with my dress and my other jewelry.The only problem I had with it was that the clasp did not want to stay closed. Several times throughout the evening, the bracelet fell off. Fortunately, I found it every time, but next time I may not be so lucky."
4,This is a great bracelet but......,"I had an allergic reaction to it. Some sterling silver causes me to have an allergic reaction depending on how and where it is manufactured.I love the bracelet and am going to try using clear nail polish on the inner surfaces that touch my skin, hopefully that will work."
2,Not what I thought,"We have some knives from J. A. Henckel and thought these would be a good addition. Theses are all serated and cut really good when using a sawing motion. They do not push through food as well as I would like. They are thick blades, so if you are looking for thin paring or boning knives, these will disappoint you."
2,"Fulcrum, lever and base combined with two way action","I felt that the most valuable material in the dvd was the fulcrum, lever and base combined with the two way action. Unfortunately, there are very few close ups clearly showing the wrist action and hand placements. The instruction would have been much more effective with close ups and slow motion.I was disappointed with the focus of the dvd being more on Leon Jay's emphasis on the pressure points striking without providing any real instruction on that topic. I did not see the connection between the title of the dvd and what the emphasis of the instruction that is actually on the dvd is. The title could have just as easily been Leon Jay shows off his knowledge of pressure points and knocks a few people out.However, the real value and a special treat on this dvd is a short biography of Professor Wally Jay. Well done and worth the price of the dvd alone."
5,"Eleanor Burns, Flying geese book",Received the book in excellent condition.would purchase through this seller again andrecommend them.
5,A Greatly Balanced Book,"If you love fantasy, this is the book for you. It binds very familiar and legendary characters and edge-of-your-seat suspense so you can't put this book down. Richard Knaak delivers again and succeeds in flying colours. I have the whole saga, and I believe this book is one of the best. I recommend this book to any reader who enjoys fantasy. Even if this is your first fantasy book, it will most likely be the building block for the rest of the Dragonlance Saga."
2,Almost a disgrace...,"I feel that this book was not up to true Dragonlance standard. The author obviously didn't have time to even leaf through the Chronicles to find references to Huma. There are a large number of holes in it, leaving out stuff that was sorely needed to make this book even an interesting read. Huma and Magius are both hugely disappointing characters. I found it almost laughable that the so-called 'greatest war wizard' couldn't even pass the Test. In my opinion, Richard A. Knaak's book didn't rate highly when compared with some much better Dragonlance books by Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, Douglas Niles, Jeff Crook, Mary Kirchoff etc. etc. etc.I would not recommend not bothering with this book, and proceeding straight onto Kaz the Minotaur, which I didn't yawn ALL the way through."
3,Ok,This game has some falts and pros. Like the 1 level where batman is trying to sneak up on these guys is really hard. Also that it is based totally on the movie!!
1,This junk dented my RV,"I was hopeful that this would work well because the price was right but I was terribly disappointed.The problem is that the post is designed to fit two different sized receivers. Unfortunately, it doesn't work well on the most common size, the 4""x4"". They have this plastic shim in there that just does not work at all.There is so much play that the bikes sway back and forth with every turn. The post travels at least a foot in both directions.Because it is so loose, the small, kids bikes I had on it crashed into the back of my brand new, $22,000 travel trailer and dented it in two places!I am so mad about it. I guess the only thing I can do is warn other shoppers."
1,Doesn't Fit Ford Ranger 2X2 Hitch,"We didn't feel that the bikes would ride securely on this rack, because it wobbles in our Ford Ranger's 2x2 hitch receiver. There's a plastic adaptor that you have to use with a 2x2 hitch. It appears to be sized a little too small.Rather than mess around with trying to ""fix"" a poorly designed product, we disassembeled the thing, put it back in the box and returned it to the store. I wouldn't recommend ordering it online."
2,Not what I was hoping,"My husband and I purchased this mount hoping to make our lives easier when transporting the family's bikes. The first time we used it (mounted two adult bikes), we noticed swaying each time we hit a bump or turned a corner too sharply. Giving the item the benefit of the doubt, I attributed this to assembly error and not faulty manufacturing. So being the perfectionist, I disassembled the rack, combed through the assembly instructions one more time and reassembled the rack. Well this time I mounted two youth bikes and wow let the swaying begin. I think the cars on the road gave us at least three car lengths between us and them just in case we lost the bikes and the rack! We drive a Ford Explorer, the mount fit, however it never seemed secure. I wish I had chosen the Schwinn model!"
4,Tai Chi,Great book so far. My only request is if they can make an app to go with the book. I think that would be a nice addition.
2,Dissapointing,"As an artist myself I was expecting this book to feature alot more art then was delivered. If you want to read such exiting interview question such as 'What is your favourite food""? Then this book will knock your socks off. For anyone else with a pulse, the interviews will get boring and tedious quite quickly."
1,NOT available from Amazon!!!!,"I ordered this product from Amazon earlier this Fall and after several weeks of waiting,I could not get any estimate as to when it might be available from Amazon. I honestly don't think Amazon ever had any intention of of filling the order. I finally cancelled the order. The more I deal with Amazon the more I question their integrity."
5,A survey of recipes from Van Gogh's last home,"Van Gogh's Table At The Auberge Ravoux isn't just an art book, though Van Gogh's paintings form its foundation - it's also a survey of recipes from his last home, providing an intimate portrait of his world and culinary appreciations. Recipes are from the cafe and boarding house where the painter lived his final days, and provide intriguing views of dishes and art."
5,Excellent Resource!,"Although I've published work in other areas - I really didn't know much about food writing or how to get started. This book was the perfect guide because it gave me the big picture (e.g. food writing can be anything from writing resturant reviews to writing recipes and cookbooks, to writing a personal memoir or fiction) and the nuts and bolts (e.g. it clearly explains how food writing is different from other genres and how to get published). The author has so much real-life and professional experience, that it was like having my own personal consultant! I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to write about food."
5,Chihuahua loves it!,"The only dog toys that stand up to time. Have had this mouse and the octopus for about 5 years of fun play. They wash well without stopping the ""squeak""!"
1,A Temporary Lift,"This opener works fine for a short time, but when it goes there is no middle ground. The built in (annoying) feature that freezes the keypad for 30 seconds if you hit the wrong number is the same feature that makes it impossible to recover when a number starts to go bad. If it doesn't work, you can't try again for 30 seconds and, after the 3rd try, it won't work again until you open the door from the inside. Mine worked correctly for less than a year. It is poorly made and poorly thought out."
3,Be aware this only works with openers made prior to 2005,"This probably works great with the proper door opener. The only problem is that when I bought the opener from Amazon it was bundled with this remote. But since the door opener was made after 2005 it wouldn't work. I don't know if Amazon has corrected this on their site, but beware. To be fair to Amazon they did refund my purchase price, but who needs that hassle."
1,Died after 6 months,"Worked great for about six months. Stopped working last week so I replaced the battery today. Still wouldn't work so I tried another battery and the connector (9 volt style) broke off. Now the whole unit is useless. I'm pretty sure it was dead anyways, but a cheap connector adds insult to injury.Avoid this one."
2,Weak,"This book bugged me. The basic thesis, in my view, aside from being unpersuasive, amounts to self-congratulation."
5,Superb,"This book is clear, concise, and to the point. The language is in such a way as to pack the maximum information into the minimum space and yet remain fully intelligible.The techniques and methods described are top rate. If your desire is to not simply learn database design and implementation but to ""understand"" it, this is the book for you."
3,Uneven,"This book basically is a collection of stories, bound together by a travel report. The stories vary between highly witty and almost embarrassingly average. They do not always fit together to make a consistent whole. But - if you skip some of the worst passages - this is one of the most amusing books one can find. As a German native speaker I especially enjoyed the part about the ""awful German language""."
1,Moving On,"I found this book, what I was able to read, to be poorly written and uninteresting to say the very least. Did not capture my attention and I thought the scenes and characters were very unrealistic... just very boring. Would not suggest this book!"
1,Reader from MN,"Other than lots of sex and more sexy talk, there's not much here worth plunking down your money for. However, if that's why you buy a book, this H-O-T one is the one to buy.But if you read for a good story, try another book."
4,Amazon is a great way to find old PS2 games,"My two boys are great fans of Batman and they just love this game. A little before their time but still a great game especially when you can get a like new copy cheap, something like $10.00."
2,some mo garbage,"My favorite super hero is batman. the graphics is all right. but everything else is garbage. you do the same thing every level. You grapple here, interogate him get the password. scare these guy's they get so called terrified. Beat them up game over. I got one word.Garbageyes I am over 13 and I cant spell. all I need to know how to spell is garbage. I like this reveiw stuff."
3,"Good, but not as good as Gangsta Lovin'","This is somewhat catchy but I'm upset Gwen didn't play a bigger part-she just harmonizes with Eve in the chorus. And....it isn't as good as ""Gangsta Lovin',"" which, to this day, is Eve's best song ever."
3,A GREAT DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO DEAL WITH A TRS WOMAN,"This book is of great use to the psychonalaytic model because it throroughly explains what the therapy for the syndrome adresses, which is Trauma reeneacment Syndrome, should be treated. Although this book only provides one psychoanalist's point of view, it give great information on what a woman with TRS goes under. This is also a great book to read and get credit for an abnormal psychology book review, eh Ms. Martin?"
1,Did we read the same book?,"Harrowing, great fiction, page-turner...Looking over these reviews, I must have read a different book. The characterization was sloppy, to say the least. The guy who said ""youse"" so you knew he was a louse (and he said it every stinking time he opened his mouth), cardboard characters aplenty, characters who changed their perceptions of each other just long enough to have sex, firefighting facts dropped with the subtlty of lead balloons...This was the first book I'd read by Suzanne Chazin. Even though I bought the second book at the same time and actually have it in my possession, I can't bring myself to read it. I paid $2 for both books and I feel like I got ripped off.I suggest Earl Emerson's novels for truly well-written firefighter novels. Emerson is a firefighter and, unlike Chazin, manages to create a believeable and taut thriller."
4,You need this one just for Isle of the Sirens!,"Even though this is probably the weakest of the discs in this series of four, it is still rather good. I am a huge fan of abc-era Impressions records, but I have to say, I had only heard three of the tracks from these two albums prior to having purchased this. There are a couple of tracks here that have been haunting me like the devil for the last few days, and I think everyone should hear them...they are ""Isle of the Sirens"" which recaptures some of that eerie storytelling Mr. Mayfield had abandoned after that first album...it has a ghostly production and lyrics that put me in mind of all those great prewar roots recordings. Simply amazing. ""Let Me Tell the World"" is a great ballad worthy of any Impressions best-of collection...I cannot believe I haven't heard it til now. The only bum tracks are the ill-chosen covers here of ""100 Lbs. of Clay"" and ""Up Up and Away"", otherwise, this is flawless. Get yours today."
1,Eats 9v batteries in a day or two,"My Clicker seems to have developed a problem after being only a month old -- it eats an entire, fresh, brand-new 9v battery in a matter of days. I keep it in the door pocket of my car and I have repeatedly verified that the buttons aren't getting mashed. I know the button isn't geting stuck -- the LED on the front illuminates when you press it, and it goes off when you would expect it to. But I've now replaced the battery three times in two weeks. Each battery was a fresh, brand new 9v bought from different stores. Energizer, Duracell, didn't matter.This makes my Clicker a useless paperweight."
4,review remote controler item,"I am pleased with the remote door opener. For some reason however, I did not recieve my original order, and I had to call on telephone to notify them that I did not recieve the order. They replaced the order and sent it to me. I then recieved it two days later with no problems. Overall I am pleased with the product and would recomend it to others for the price.Thank you. Zoltan Balogh"
2,Partial Success,"Remote worked for the Sears Green learning button garage door opener....but does not work with Sears dip switch garge door opener.Instructions are vague in parts, and forget calling tech support. I was on speakerphone on hold during the entire evening news as well as dinner and still in cue. I lost any interest in getting this to work just because of the non existent customer support."
1,NOT a proper replacement,"This unit was listed as a replacement remote for my Sears garage door opener... BUT, unlike the Sears remote, which has eight 3-position switches to set the opener code, this devices only has eight 2-position switches to set the opener code with my unit. The instructions blow past this point saying ""just don't use any of the 0 settings for the switchs), but this reduces the number of possible opener codes from 6,561 to only 256, which is much less secure. No thank you."
1,"Didn't work, couldn't get help, website was down",The CLT1D wouldn't work with my Chamberlain door opener. Couldn't get anyone to answer the help line and the help line didn't even recognize the the CLT1D as a valid model number. I bought a #CLT1 somewhere else for my other garage door opener (same model of Chamberlain) and it works great. Buy the CLT1D at your own risk.
3,not so great,Its not the same as it used to be it didn't cover the same and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't nearly as light as I hoped.
1,nutrisse nourishing color foam,"NEVER, NEVER AGAIN will I usse ANY Garnier products. I used the coloring foam, followed the instructions perfectly & guess what? HALF OF MY HAIR FELL OUT BY THE HANDFULL. My beauty routine has been exactly the same before and after coloring my hair. The only variable is this hair color. I am just livid. What's left is broken off and the consistancy is like straw. When I contacted the company all they offered me was a hot oil treatment for no more than twenty five dollars. I offered to send them before and after pictures and they refused to look at them. The color was ok but lasted for less than eight shampoos. Do yourself a favor & stay away from this brand. It may work fine today but it's like this. The dog chases the cat, the dog chases the cat, the dog chases the cat the dog catches the cat & your hair is a disaster. I'm going to have to get a short haircut. And I look like a pinhead in short hair. Stay far, far away from this company & their awful products."
5,Great Idea Idea Book!,"The high spirits and easy going nature of Jon can decieve you! Behind those high spirits and easy going nature are insouciance and flippancy!!(""Insouciance"" means high spirits - ""flippancy"" means easy going nature). I have thoroughly enjoyed Jon's Hook Book. He is the Betty Crocker of crack-you-up commentary! I think more than anything else that his insights and quotes give you, is the postulate of simplicity and lightness that permeates the genuine depth that Jon carries like a beautiful hot air balloon! This book is a must for those who need a muse connection!"
2,Blah!,"I love Denzel & everything, but I was not impressed with this movie @ all...actually went to see this in the theaters the first week. Somebody on the radio was mad that it came in @ #2...when it should've been #1{in her opinion} She needs to be happy it was in the top 5.It only gets 2 stars cause of Denzel & Eva."
3,Pedestrian Latter Day Noir,"I always like it when Denzel Washington stretches his acting muscles and takes on characters with darker shading (see ""Training Day"" and ""Man on Fire""). And he does account himself pretty good here as the philandering Florida Keys police chief who may or may not be set up. That said, this vehicle is pretty much of a waste of his time and talent. The plot does take an interesting twist at the film's midpoint but a ten year old could predict the ultimate denouement and the ending is a little too pat for my taste. Pretty much the sole reasons to recommend this flick is Washington and a pretty good turn by Eva Mendes as Washington's estranged detective wife."
4,Good Film,"This film is a must for all of you Denzel fans.Good plot, excellent casting, and good action sequences.And the ending keeps you on the edge of your chair because Denzel is ""Out of Time"".Buy used."
3,pretty good,"We start out with a small town cop(the Chief no less) cheating and drinkin hard as his divorce is pending.The beautiful babe he is cheating with is getting beat up by her old man, Dean Cain of Superman fame. He hates the husband but loves her body. His Ex is just as bodacious and Ill never understand why he left her. Any way nothing is really as it seems as the twists and turns begin. Soon he is framed for stealin 450,000 jack he was holding from a mob bust and the murders of his main squeeze and her hubby. Now he must become a player to fool his ex(a miami cop also) the C.I.A. and his own police force. How he does it is tricky and kinda unbelivable, but our hero is down wit it. The ending can be seen coming form a mile off but, after a film full of the two babes its cool. This film is rated 3 stars."
4,"Excellent, but wordy","I was highly impressed with Eller's thinking throughout the book. He was able to put into words a number of things I had been mulling over, but was unable to adequately express. All Atheists, Agnostics and Theists worth their salt owe this book a careful reading.The only complaint I could register was that there are just too damn many words, cover to cover."
2,Less Than I Expected,This puzzle is less sturdy than I thought it would be. I would estimate its value at $4. There are no handles on the puzzle pieces. You can do better for the money.
4,It's a Good thing they DIDN'T Put Badge on it!,"The only dissapointment I had with the CD was the mediocre version of ""Badge""....""Badge"" is my gavorite song, but in the CD, the song is terrible so it's good they left it off! Everyother song is good."
4,"A Good, Not Great Clapton DVD","I love the songs on this DVD, though I'm not a huge fan of the orchestra section. One thing that does bother me is the 3 seconds between camera cuts. For example, during a 30 second solo, the viewer will jump back between the audience, backup singers, pianist, bassist, and finally Clapton."
3,When less is more,"I'm a Richie Cole fan, but I can't be as positive about this release as the previous reviewer. I give it 3 1/2 Stars.Why?The pianist: Bobby Enriquez. Calling it ""Liberace"" is too generous. ""Chico Marx"" is more like it. Track 10 ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"" IS slaughtered, and should have stayed in the can. Enriquez plays more notes than 3 or 4 bop pianists put together, and most of them are meaningless.It's too bad, because the sound is clean and punchy.But at times you can almost hear the ghost of Eddie Jefferson behind such classics as Charlie Parker's ""Confirmation."" If Richie Cole has any unreleased Eddie Jefferson tracks in the vault, it would be a service to release them.So skip Track 10, and imagine what it would have been like had Eddie Jefferson not gone down."
3,Unification is a Revelation,"While I don't often pop this substantial rocker into my stereo, when I do its usually to listen to the instrumental Unification. The beautiful build up, subtle tension and revelatory and joyous explosion of this composition are fairly astounding. It almost seems to call for a choir at times."
2,poor packaging... it looked like it had been used,"The mat came wrapped in plastic wrap, not the actual original packaging. I'm gonna have to call customer service to see if I actually purchased a used product instead of a new one. I'm very disappointed."
1,Difficult,I would guess this book is for kids over 13 or 14...my 10-year-old granddaughter found it confusing and cluttered...and so did I!
1,Works less than 10% of the time,"A great idea if only it would work. Even with the microphone mounted directly on (or in) the doorbell case and the sensitivity turned all the way up, the chime only works about 10% of the time. I called the company and their response was I needed a bigger, louder doorbell. Back to looking for a product that can be wired directly into the doorbell."
1,Very unreliable,"My experience with this product is similar to most of those stated. From day 1, the extender worked intermittently and unpredictably. It's mounted right on top of my doorbell chime. So, I don't really understand why the performance should be unpredictable.Over time, its performance degraded. Now (even with new batteries and the sensitivity turned up), it works less than 10% of the time. I give my strongest non-recommendation to this product."
1,worthless,"I bought this at Ace when I moved my home office upstairs and was unable to hear the doorbell. I've had this product for over 5 months now, and no amount of adjusting will make it work. It will go off if the dog barks near the transmitter, or when we run the vacuum, but never when there's someone at my door. Very disappointed. A waste of $30."
5,WOW,"This show is one of those shows that at the time was extremely cool. I watched every episode and found the series to be original and fun to watch. I got addicted to the show and it always amazed me when they did something that I was not expecting. While the last episode was not all that great, it is still worth watching and so put a bag of pop corn in the microwave and grab a couple of sodas and enjoy a afternoon of real entertainment. You will not find more entertainment then this show."
4,great new show,"this show has a lot of promise. awesome visual effects. if you like people with powers and stuff, you will like this show."
5,An addictive show,Any Heroes fan would be delighted to own the complete series. The video quality is fantastic and there is nothing like watching the complete series in one sitting. Each episode keeps you wanting more with it's gripping plot and character development.
5,one of the best dvd productions ever,"I'd like to review the DVDs and not the series (which is of course great)!I collect a lot of series on DVD and most of the time these productions are only made to bring in fast money. None or little extras, no heart just quick 'n' dirty.Heroes is different. The whole thing shows the love of the producers all over it. Nice looks, great menus and, to top it all, a trillion of extras!Almost every episode has deleted scenes, most of them have a commentary track and lots of other things that really make these DVDs a MUST to buy.Compare this production to Star Trek (and I love ST). ST when it first came out on DVD had no extras, poor quality and you had to pay twice as much as you have to pay for heroes.Is there anything else to say?Go out and get it NOW!"
2,A Matter of Opinion,"I watched the first episode of Heroes, and while it was well made with very good acting, I came away with a less than positive view of this program. The producers seem to strongly promote the theory of evolution, mildly promote teen suicidal attempts, etc. In general, if you're looking for a good sci-fi with high morals, and some family values more like Smallville promotes, you might would rather watch, well... Smallville. I'm selling my Heroes set."
4,"Heroes Great, Amazon not so","The Heroes series is amazing. Just watch it. One of the best shows in recent years. Up there with 24. I hope Season 2 is just as good. Although I don't expect it to be.I bought this from Amazon USA to be delivered in the UK. Because I didn't want to pay for the UK hike in price (over double what it is in USA for the same item). It eventually arrived 8 days late. But instead of being delivered, there was a Customs charge of just over 12 to pay on it (which is still cheaper than UK version!). Unexpected, Amazon didn't warn me about it. It's the first USA Region 1 DVD I've bought. Works fine in my DVD players. Doesn't work on my computer, but I expected that.5 Stars for Heroes, 2 Stars for Amazon.com"
4,Buen producto... pero,"Lastimosamente en la descripción mencionaban subtítulos en español y no traía.Sin embargo... y a pesar de eso, cuenta con excelente imagen y sonido."
5,Heroes Season 2,"Box set was said to be in good condition, but I felt that it was in excellent condition. Very satisfied."
4,A Good Start,"It's always amusing to watch a new sci-fi or fantasy series commence, trying to explain how their 'heroes' arrived at their newly found status. In a way, this makes Heroes novel, with a huge part of this first series being all about this journey. Normally producers of such series drag this out over an extended period of time, feeding the audience titbits in the hope of keeping the audience captivated through titilation. It is this voyeuristic approach to the past which makes Heroes (and for that matter, Lost and similar) the success it has been. However I felt that sometimes the scriptwriters ran out of ideas and shortchanged the audience by making the 'Bobby Ewing gets out of the shower' leaps of faith, which stretched the incredulity, and distorted the story. I'm going to be honest, I am only halfway through this first series at the moment, so I will rereview this upon viewing completion."
5,Heroes Season 1,"I bought the HD-DVD series for my wife and I ended up watching it more than her. I had some trouble with Disk 4, but once I upgraded the software on my HD-DVD player, everything worked and looked great."
4,Commentary Lacking,"If you loved Season 1 as I did this set will make you happy but if you like extra features you may be somewhat disappointed. Some of the DVDs have commentary for each episode but some of them have only 1 episode per disk with a commentary track. To me it was a slight blemish on an otherwise fine product. There aren't any extra features such as background ""making of"" and that was another blemish but if you buy DVD sets for the show and not the extras then you may appreciate not having to navigate alot of garbage."
4,Good TV Series,"I liked the series when it was on TV. I wanted to re-watch it and watch the episodes I missed. The first two seasons are good, there's a lot going on and a lot of showing of powers. I feel later in the series it gets very odd and too soap opera like."
5,Heroes,This box set is a really great buy for any Heroes or prime time drama fan. The commentary and deleted scenes are really cool and go very in depth about the show. Also the 73 minute episode is really interesting because of the many character changes and different plot lines that were completely changed including a whole terrorist plot that had a middle eastern Ted. Also the behind the scenes and making of are amazing because of the techniques they used for the TV show. It was really mind blowing and interesting to learn how they did technical things for the show without using special effects. Great dvd set and awesome extras A++.
1,My shipment is late and I do not know how to contact you.,I hope somebody sees this. My shipment is quite late. Season 4 arrived a few days ago. How do I get help with this? Thank you.
3,"I Love this Album But Terrible In Your Face Mastering, Get ""Best Of"" Instead","I love The Count Bishops/Bishops and love this album but the mastering is ""In Your Face"" sound which I can't stand and is unlistenable if you do not live in a private home as the bass is way too loud. Yes, you can listen to this if the bass is lowered but it loses dynamics. The perfect example is that some of the songs on this album are on ""The Best of The Bishops"" pn Ace and are mastered so much better and not in your face."
3,These are clichés that attack the left only,"This is a reprint of a similar book previously entitled ""Clichés of Socialism."" It is an irreverent collection of 83 right-wing shibboleths, against ""socialist tinkering,"" repackaged as contemporary nuggets of patriotic wisdom. Were it not so obviously politically skewed, this book could be a potentially valuable collectible. However since it is both dated and gores only one side of the ""sacred cow,"" it is much less valuable. Instead of just changing the title, the author should also have changed the content.Arguably, in today's reactionary American culture, which is slowly drifting in the direction of Fascism, and given that Communism is on its last legs, we sorely need a book that explores the clichés from the other side of the sacred cow much more than from the side presented here.Still, if one can overlook this built-in bias, there is a great deal of knowledge and truth exposed in analyzing these clichés.Three stars"
5,Good skate/thrashcore,"Mr. sum 41 needs to shut the hell up. KLU makes the best hardcore music that a pop punk band, like sum 41, will never come close to. Pick this up if you're into good raw hardcore while Sum 41 guy goes to his nickelback concert."
2,Jazzy,"I watched his DVD and really enjoyed seeing this talented man. I blindly seleted this cd and find it waaay too jazzzy for my taste. I had hoped for more of his smooth, Brazilian sound."
5,Unanswered Cries. Good True Crime book.,Great book. I have ready many True Crime books and this one kept me interested. I would recommend this book to anybody that reads True Crime books.
3,Unanwered Cries,I was a little disappointed in this story. Does not really seem the punishment fit the crime.The victim suffered a good deal more than the neighbor who did it.
4,Really good true crime book that makes you think,"This is the rare true crime book that actually improves with a second reading; things that seem innocuous or commonplace the first time through will reveal their true nature and secrets on a reread. Thankfully, this book avoids the ""victim beatification"" too often found in other true crime books; here, the deceased is shown as she was, with both virtues and flaws. My only real complaints are that the end of the book feels a bit rushed, and that the author starts treating the suspect as guilty before the sentence is passed; it's well-established tradition in these books for the author to at least feign neutrality until the jury returns a verdict, at which time he or she is then free to let loose."
2,Not a good fit,"only installs one way, still doesn't conform to the actual shape of the door frame. better than nothing, that's about it."
3,Mistaken version,"BEWARE ! This is NOT the version with Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff & Vincent Price. This is a newer remake with Vincent Price only. Note the film dates. The description does NOT match this movie. The earlier one is a masterpiece, & although you may like this one, it is not the what the description says."
3,"Critics have been ruff on this collection, and I know why...","It's because the producers chose to save the best for last. Just hang in there, dear Viewer, and you'll be rewarded with ""Koko"" and ""Roof"", the two best in the lot. The rest are middling. The little intermission cartoon piece is cute and actually grew on me. Not an erotic or sexy collection, but thoughtful and interesting, and what more do we ask? It's about as good if not better than a lot of other movies out there which explains my rating."
2,Save your money,"There are some much better quality stories on other short movie DVD's that are available such as ""Watching you"", which leaves this DVD in it's dust."
1,Too fragile. Didn't last coming out of the box,"Neat concept, but the wing materials are too weak to withstand flight. Immediately after launch, the wings go way past horizontal, killing any forward progress. Don't waste your money."
4,Still a Wonder After All These Years,"I remember watching this show faithfully as a kid, and I have to say, it still brings me joy after all these years. Although the special effects were the bare minimum, they got their message across loud and clear. It's amazing what a TV show can do on a modest budget. I do have to say that, despite what others have said, I prefered the first season show over the second and third seasons. The World War II era shows were much more gripping and exciting, relatively speaking."
5,Afternoon Owls CD,I ordered a used CD and received a new one which made this transaction a surprising exception. I've spent many afternoons enjoying this CD and I'll return again to the prompt service and enjoyable product(s) from Amazon.com.
1,Child in Tears,"This seller and item were both AWFUL! I have never felt so compelled to write a review. Usually don't waste my time, but needed to warn others!! Rude seller.Wouldn't replace defective item.Receipt says they will return and refund items but they DO NOT! The airplanes were so cheaply made they broke while putting together.(if they weren't already broken in the package) My seven year old son was IN TEARS because he had saved up his money to buy two of these. Since I opened the package (to put it together)they said I couldn't return it. I have had several styrofoam airplanes in the past, so I DO KNOW WHAT I am talking about. DON'T LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS! Really, you couldn't just refund the defective items? Back your products and if they stink, refund the customer! Don't buy from them. Target carries a heavy duty airplane that we will purchase again.(AirHogs stickers on it)"
2,Just as I remembered...,"So...the glider arrived broken at the wing joint. I remember these being fragile as a kid anyway. The packing was good so I know it was packed broken. No matter. Though I enjoyed the repair since I'm a tinkerer, I am a bit annoyed that I paid twenty bucks to receive something broken. If you're not a handy person...don't order. If you are...by all means."
3,Was packaged poorly,"I didn't want it to be sealed, so when I got it I opened it. However when I got it in the mail, the top part was bent, and looked like I just got thrown in the box. Perhaps next time they shouldn't be so rough with this product."
5,My Kid LOVES This Book!,"The pictures are cute (but not overly so), the prose is well-written, and the story is great w/ the lesson of friendship & giving. I got this for my daughter when she was 13 months old. It took a couple weeks before she got to the point where she wanted to hear the whole story instead of just randomly flipping through pages & looking at the pictures. We also got Kipper's A to Z which is fantastic."
3,"sturdy, tall shoe - but easily scuffed","I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
5,Negri is amazing,"Antonio Negri is probably best known for Empire, the book he wrote a couple of years ago with Michael Hardt. That brilliant survery of globalization and late capitalism remains essential reading for anyone interested in the subject. Negri's new book is a reprint of some pamphlets he published in 1970's, but it is still an incisive and pertinant work. Reacting to the tremendous disparities between the social classes in Italy, Negri grapples with the central moral questions involved in revolutionary change and violence. I found it an initially difficult but rewarding work, and it would be interesting if many people, not only on the left, but on the right as well, took the time to check it out. This is one of those books that has alot to teach to people on both sides of the political fence, and Negri, as someone who has really paid his dues (he was imprisoned in Italy, and the pamphlets in Books for Burning helped to put him behind bars) is an important figure in Marxist thought."
3,Could be Better for the Money,These were a snap to install. Light Weight so go easy or risk denting the tube. I had to remove my tow hooks to install this but it fit right up after that. I got mine at a super reduced price so I really can't complain. If I had paid the price listed here I would not be happy with the Bull Bar. I have had mine on for about 8 months now and noticed that the lower stainless grate is discolor. Not sure why as most of the time I have been in the deserts of Colorado. I will need to use a stainless polish on this. Hope that the grill work with Weston name punched out in it cleans up easy. The tubes are however still very shiny and easy to clean. Didn't feel the need for mounting any lights on mine.
3,Interesting,This book keeps you interested. The battle between good and evil has just begun. Are you strong enough to beat the Devil?!?
1,RELIGULOUS,"Most of the other bad reviews state the various typing and editing errors so I won't bore you with that. All I will say is that never, EVER in my life did I expect to read, let alone pay for, over 300 pages of religious propaganda.Perfect example of judging a book by its cover..."
3,Read other Clyde Edgerton,Not the best of his works. Try Raney or Walking Across Egypt to know why there are Clyde Edgerton fans who will even read Redeye: A Western. And don't ever miss an opportunity to hear him talk and tell tales.
5,Titanic model kit,I purchased this for my son as he loves Titanic. This is his first ever model to be built and so far so good. I like it because it teaches him patience and it doesn't look to hard to assemble.
2,Not what expected,"I have read all of her Lakeside Chronicles, and enjoyed all but one of those. This book however, was set across the country at the LakeSHORE and somehow was very flat and uninspiring."
4,Lakeside cottage,I liked this book. The beginning really surprised me but then took a totally different turn. It held my interest. I like a book with love involved but not sex and this one was what i expected. An enjoyable read.
4,Lakeside cottage,This was a Great book I love all of the books that have read thus far written by Susan Wiggs
5,Lively Reading,"The search for authentic experiences is regarded as an important theme in postmodernism. John Millington Synge's book demonstrates that this quest for authenticity has been an important part of cultural inquiry for a long time. This wonderful book was written almost one hundred years ago, but it reads like a contemporary ethnographic inquiry. He provides vivid descriptions of daily life and wonderful presentations of the folklore of the Aran Islands. The book is primarily descriptive, but there are interesting textures and conclusions throughout Synge's writing. I would recommend reading this book and then watching Flaherty's film ""Man of Aran."" Follow up that visual feast with Stoney's ""The Making of the Myth."" To complete your excursion, top things off with a reading of Synge's ""Playboy of the Western World"" and ""Riders to the Sea,"" two fine plays that he set on the Aran Islands. The stories, descriptions, and textures within Synge's book will become very clear when you're finished."
4,good because of illustrations and emphasis on clean eating,"the pictures helped me understand the positions for the excersises and the fact that clean eating contributes to the healthy butt should not be minimized so yes, this book is a great start. The pictures make it fun, fast and easy to read. There are pictures of the food as well so it makes all those veggies look very appealing; another great start."
3,Mixed Reviews - 4 stars YYH and 2 for Nunku = 3 overall,The Yu Yu Hakusho Movie is great IF you are already familiar with the series. If you don't know a thing about Yu Yu Hakusho you're going to be lost. It jumps straight into the story without giving you any background information. If you have the basics of the manga or the TV series you won't have any problem enjoying it. Plot: Koenma(jr) gets kidnapped with Yusuke and team racing to the rescue.As for the Ninku Movie all I can say is to picture the Simpsons as Martial Artists.
2,What the hell!!!!!,"What the hell is this and they call this a double feature they're barely even movies. The first is Ninku the movie the only thing I don't get is if it is the movie what happen to the series, might as well just call it Ninkuby itself.And there is the second movie, the famous Yu Yu Hakusho apparently they released the real movie Polgriest Report which is ten times better then this crap. Sure it has an okay plot but if they really wanted to make a movie out of this they could have made it longer at least an hour and had better voice actors."
1,crappy,i purchased this dvd thinking that it was the other(and better movie poltergiest report) i had seen poltergiest report before but didnt remember the name anywho this dvd was horribl i am like the BIGGEST fan of yuyuhakusho an i found this offensive to all fans because it sucked it sucked more thatn britteny spears ithe plot was horrible and the animation did not live up to the seriries i was devastated when i watched this movie to any true yuyuhakusho fan i warn u stay away from this dvd i strongly suggest POLTERGIEST REPORT it is an excellent yuyu film
4,Subtle satire of a film genre,"Here we have a joyous occasion where *three* under-recognized actors have a chance to deliver a nuanced and very entertaining performance. John Vernon (of course recognized as the Dean in ""Animal House"") is a fine character actor and can find ways of expressing anger or delight even when the script and direction take a downbeat turn. Al Waxman's plays a character in confusion and he, too, can make filet mignon out of chuck. Margo Kidder is the loopy, leggy underachiever, exotic dancer and paramour of, euphemistically speaking, an undesireable who agrees to complete the evil task conjured up by Don Luciano's (Vernon character) ex-cohort in crime.The frigid setting itself is somehow made funny by the offbeat, effective directing and writing. Viewers, is this now considered a ""Cult Classic""?"
1,Worse movie ever,"Okay, this is one of those very very low budget movies with a stupid story line that no one in their right mind would watch for entertainment or any other purposes. The quality of the picture sucks, and the actos are horrendous. The directing is the worst I have ever seen. And the storyline is extremely boring. If you are interested in wasting money on this movie, get it. If you are trying to build a mob movie collection, and you want to have every movie ever made, get it. But if you are a mob movie enthusiast, you are better off watching something else. No one with any taste would watch this movie!"
4,Misa Criolla,"Having heard snatches of this music on Classic FM, I was keen to hear the whole album. I was not disappointed - the beautiful voice of Jose Carreras was more than adequately supported by the Sociedad Choral de Bilbao.Top marks for this composition from Ariel Ramirez - altogether a spiritually uplifting experience."
4,Very Fun...can drag on though,"This is a very good card game. It is mainly luck of the draw but there is some skill involved at times. I will say that I just finished a game, no, we didn't finish, but we were going on playing for 4 hours straight. WARNING! Don't play with too many people, you will suffer a game of great lengths. Although, I have played games that took more than one day to complete.This game is very fun though. Great for those camping trips, family get-togethers, long rainy days (like today). I highly recommend. The only bad thing I have to say is that the games can go on, and on, and on....but that is easily dealt with. Give it a try if you're a fan of UNO, Skip-Bo, Rummy, etc...Enjoy!"
5,This game keeps the adults entertained,This game of Phase 10 keeps the adults entertained while the kids play with their electronic games.It keeps us laughing and having fun more than regular cards do.It would be well worth for you to purchase. It just gets better and better.
5,One of the Best,"I haven't seen the other tapes as of yet, but this anime series seems worth the time of viewing. I love the animation, the story, and the characters."
2,as expected...,"I purchased Manic after reading many decent reviews. After viewing the movie, I am somewhat disappointed. The movie started out kind of slow, though it was able to capture my attention later on and keep me watching. The dialogue was poorly written; it definitely could have been written better. The shaky camera work, highly contrasted shots, and unnecessarily prolonged close-ups were distracting. Overall, I'd say the movie was okay."
3,"Decent flick with ok dialouge, not quite IFC standards","This movie has a very interesting and styleistic opening scene and following scenes but they dont really go anywhere, it just sort of flows on. One may not expect much change and matureing to happen at a mental insitution, but still, its a movie. The main guy is not too beleaveable execept when he fights, not at just being and suffering within himself. The best performances are by Don Cheatle, the quiet Indian/Mexican kid (he was excelent), and the big and rowdy wigger. The ending lacks visual breakthrough and could have been better, if it was a bit darker and had a different male lead."
3,"Boy, Interrupted","I saw this a couple of years ago at the Seattle International Film Festival, and it was pretty much your standard nut-house flick. There is a token goth chick, a token bully, a basketball game used as a bonding moment, group sessions with mildly amusing topics and, of course, a little ""incident"" where someone gets hurt. It was like watching a remake of Girl, Interrupted, just with a little better script and acting. The plot is predictable, and the whole cinema vérité style (shaky camera and all) gets really annoying, but it was still pretty interesting. There has been a lot of buzz over Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance (yes, the kid from 3rd Rock), but I didn't think it was anything special. Don Cheadle was great as always though -- any movie with him in it is worth watching."
1,Not good software,"This software really is poorly written. The Hearts game does not allow you to follow standard playing rules; the Poker, and especially the Texas Hold 'Em is not a true game of chance as it is programmed against the game player. When playing Blackjack, if you buy insurance, the dealer never has blackjack, when you don't buy it, it does have blackjack. The pegs on the cribbage board disappears when it makes the turn to the new column."
2,"NICE CITY, BAD MOVIE!","After watching for few minutes I realized we were not going to get anywhere ""Sacred Silence"" Another example of a Priest making a Bad Judgment. I kept waiting for the next Character to introduce him or herself as they did through out the Film looking straight at the Camera...what was the Point for That? Maybe that's how they make Films in Naples. It was nice to see the Beautiful City and for that I gave it two Stars!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Heavens to Betsy, what a joke! The picture quality is horrible, the sub titles don't make sense half the time and after watching this flick, I honestly can't even tell you what I watched. A whole lot of violence and killing for no appearent reason. It's a semi-narrative film with each character giving their date of birth and I suppose who they are and what they are supposed to represent to the plot of the film. Not at all what I expected. It appears the Priest molested the boy and the boy reported him although the boy seemed to esteem the priest very highly. I don't know, it makes little if any sense. I would recommend staying far far away from this one. I wish I had."
3,Culture - The Journey of Reggae,The audio cd recording title 17 Chapters of Culture is a vintage collection of Culture's reggae music. Brings back memories of childhood and how reggae music was defined by the authentic roots rock style. Culture's style is both unique and definitive up to today. The cd was converted from analogue recordings so still maintains that feel of tape sound.This cd has filled a gap in my collection that could not be filled by anything else.
5,Not JUST for weight loss,"If you're completely new to Pilates, it's perfect for you. If you're experienced in it, this may not be the best choice of a DVD. This was the 4th Pilates program I bought and it's better then all 3 of the others combined. The instruction is detailed and separate from the actual exercise sessions. There are several sessions of different lengths and focusing on different areas (legs, upper body) at each of the 3 levels. As you get to the harder levels they start going faster but it's not too fast."
2,"This video is good enough, and that's it.","This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout. I still think the moves work, but I'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me."
3,Transition is disjointed,"As another reviewer stated, this DVD is very disjointed. When moving from one position to another, the screen would go black so you have no idea what position will come up next until they lift the black veil, by then you are scrambling to get in sync with what they are doing. There are better pilates DVDs out there."
2,Nice variety but voiceover is terrible,"This dvd has several options for pilates workouts, but the whole time it is a voiceover with a person (not speaking) doing the workout. This creates a very odd dynamic and flow. The energy is quite low in the dvd and the production quality is mediocre at best."
5,Great,"I am a bit overweight and new to Pilates and this DVD has helped alot. It is presented very well with three levels that are modified for your level. The beginning moves are easier versions that are modified for those new to pilates and/or out of shape to be able to help you learn them. Then the next levels present less modifications and some more moves, which is also described in each level. Very easy to follow and understand as you build along the way."
2,Pilates weight loss,"good product, but not what was advertised! I was expecting the DVD that had a woman doing pilates on the grass as my product, but instead i received an interactive personal trainer DVD for pilates. The two DVD covers are definately not the same, and if a DVD is advertised with a certain sleeve, it should be sold to the customer with the same sleeve it was advertised with."
3,"Good Content, Low Budget Quality","I thought the exercises in the DVD were just fine. However, I did not like that the DVD had a separate narrator from the person performing the exercises. It gave the whole thing a very cheap quality. Also, there is one point in the DVD where the woman actually turns her back to the screen completely while performing one of the exercises! I don't understand why she had to turn around to work her other side, as opposed to just switching sides, and continue to face the screen. You couldn't even see what she was doing. Either way, the work out was good, but the DVD format and all was terrible. Not soothing."
3,"Good, but very slow paced",I bought this dvd after renting a few from my library and found this one to be a very true pilates workout. The different levels are helpful if you are going to use the dvd for a few months. I found the different workouts on each level to be boring and monotonous. I also found the narrator to be very annoying (for lack of a better word) and her tone seemed condescending. She consistently mispronunced the word 'lengthen'.I'm now looking for a more up-tempo dvd that gets my heart pumping more.
1,This is a Black and White Movie!!,This is a fabulous movie that everyone should see in BLACK AND WHITE! Don't buy this colorized version!
5,believe,oh yes they live on dvd makes mr piper all the more accesable to the homes of the masses. now put on yer glasses and have a good time
1,Very Slowwwwwwwwwwzzzzzzzz.......,Following John Carpenters very good 'Prince of Darkness' comes this heavy handed political piece called 'They Live'. The movie moves very slowly and the movies descends into the completely ridiculous with his depiction of the homeless. THe fight scene between Keith David and Roddy Piper is memorable only because it runs for about ten excruciatingly boring minutes.Carpenter later admitted that he made this movie in some sort of attempt to attack the Reagan Adminstration. Movie makers should stick to entertainment and keep their juvenile views of politics to themselves. Carpenters movies have been crap since he started to take himself seriously. He should go back to what he's good at.Rent this is you can't sleep. It will cure the worst insomia.
4,They Live...They Rock!,"""They Live"" is a great, almost forgotten movie by Director John Carpenter. ""Rawdy"" Roddy Piper stars as the main character, who accidently stumbles onto an Alien Invasion to take over the Earth! By wearing special sunglasses, one can see thru the Alien's disguises. Not only are the Alien's already here on Earth, but they have fully integrated into society! Most of the population of Earth has been brainwashed, and doesn't even notice the Alien's blimps, or the motto on their money, ""This is your God"". Once Roddy Piper finds out, he joins the rebels!This movie is great! I highly recommend it! How can you not love the scene with an Alien having sex with a woman, and in the middle, his disguise doesn't work! Let's not forget the Classic, (20-Minute, no joke!), Fight Scene in the back alley! Fighting for that long because Piper's buddy won't wear some Sunglasses! Classic!Run, don't walk to a PC near you! Really, buy this movie, you'll love it!"
3,Fun and worth the couple hours you'll spend watching.,"Carpenter did a pretty good job with this concept-piece.Despite what seems a very limited budget, this film comes off as fun, exciting, and interesting all the way through.The plot is short, which actually does not detract from the film - rather, it's appropriately simple for the idea behind this. I don't want to spoil it for you - just don't expect ""Lord of the Rings"" here. When it is all said and done, this is a fun action film that is on par, quality-wise, with a lot of Schwartzenegger's movies, and has Carpenter's flair for decent science fiction.If you decide not to buy, this would at least be worth the rental.Have fun -T"
5,One of JC'S greater and most stuning pieces of work!,"Around the time of 1988 John Carpenter realsed They Live! a look into a drifter's world leaving only truth leaft in the shadows, and finally we find that the Truth is out there! The idea though of glasses being able to see an alien race does sound a vit dreary, but the movie is very, very, very enjoyable!"
4,"""I figured it'd be something like this.""","John Carpenter's They Live is a delightful blend of satire, biting social and political commentary, and simplistic b-movie thrills. In other words it's the 80s version of a 60s Roger Corman movie. To bad it falls apart in the last reel. Still the first hour and fifteen minutes of this underrated movie is priceless, with Carpenter's nihilist viewpoint and love of rugged individualism almost seamlessly married. Highly recommended."
5,A GREAT MOVIE,"This movie works on a number of levels, it is an excellant satire of greed and the me me culture of the 80's, and on another level it is a great sci-fi movie including all the much used and much loved sci-fi standards of alien invaision and control and thanks to Roddy Piper who surprises all with the quality of his acting the fight scenes have an extra bite which helps alot.This movie will appeal to anyone with a interest in politics as it is a classic example of the true nature of capitalism and the way in which its true goal is to set people against each other and to control the masses with consumerism.Anyone who likes action movies, sci-fi and sharp satire will think this movie is a blast, miss it if you dare."
4,Decent movie for what it is,This movie is hard to find in retail stores and rental stores. The blue ray version is great. The video is actually remastered so it is in HD and not just a simple repackage of the DVD version.
5,Looks great,"The 5 stars is for the blu-ray and not the movie itself. The picture and sound were fantastic. If I was grading the movie I would have to knock off half a star due to one of my pet peeves concerning gun fire that never hits. However, besides that it still has to this day one of my favorite endings."
3,great & unforgettable film for 5 minutes...,"I found this to be a perplexing film.In my opinion- It has one of the most poignant scenes in Sci-Fi cinema history (the Sunglasses on) and yet digresses into a tedious stream of cliches.Carpenter's homemade soundtracks seem sophomoric to me as well. I can almost see the index fingers tapping on the casio!Too bad- it could have been a ""Planet of the Apes"" of the the 80's."
3,satified customer,my item arrived in brand new condition and i was very happy with my purchase.hands down this is the B-movie ever.
4,impulse,"this was the first time i read one of her books. i don't think the text was perfectly awesome, but i didn't think it was porn either. i think all the details in this book were relevant, and i usually hate long boring details in a book."
2,Definitely NOT the best out there,"If you like to travel on dirt roads like me, then the DeLorme is almost useless, I have been using the Benchmark Atlases for years and have found that nothing even comes close to the detail of those, unfortunatley they only make them for the western states. The Delorme's show back roads as a small line that is barely visible to the naked eye, and it's up to you to travel them to figure out if they are paved, dirt, gravel, 4wd, forestry or if they even exist any longer."
2,The music in that drama,Somebody can tell me the name of the band that performs the amazing song we can hear when Suzanne Somers arrives at the Blue Moon club and sees the scene of the crime?
1,"Loaded to Windows Media Player,Big Mistake","I loaded this to Windows Media Player and all I have to show for my money are some songs that would have cost me less than $10 on Itunes.No instructions,nothing,I wish it would have just loaded like EVERY other program out there.It comes up ripping some Johnny Lang album.I don't know what the heck happened.Total mess,never again!"
4,learn to play chess,"great introduction to beginning chess. Some elements of the book are very basic, but easy to understand and is a help in building a foundation for more skilled play."
4,take a walk thru town and country....,"If you are considering this magazine by the title alone, you probably know what you like and that lies somewhere between town and country. I happen to like reading articles on many different topics including decorating, gardening, and fashion - this magazine usually has something to offer in many different areas of my interests. Yes, there are TONS of ads for things way beyond my means but the ads keep the subscription costs low and are even sometimes places to find inspiration for creative projects. If you happen to catch the November special pricing of five dollars for a whole year you can't go wrong, even if you just thumb through to look at the pictures. Nothing to lose since publishers will refund the balance of unwanted subscriptions if you are not happy."
4,Town&country,Enjoy reading this magazine.Allows a peak into how the other half lives. Enjoy the fashion which gives me the opportunity to search for similar styles at a more affordable price.
4,A Classic Must Have for Successful/Fun People,Over the years if I ever miss a copy of T&C I feel a bit lost knowing that whatever great and entertaining things were in that missed copy I will never see & know and it's an unpleasant and somewhat unsettling feeling. The reason for this of course it that for the many decades that I have been a faithful reader there have been so many memorable & fun articles that I have loved and they have become like a part of my life as knowledge. It's a STEAL for the inexpensive sub. price so naturally I always try to remember to renew! One of my very favorite feel good mags!
2,change the mood from glad to sadness,"As with other reviews i must agree, there is not much new material or insight, though what is presented is well written, another book entitlted "" the end"" was researched on a personal budget, but seems to convey alot more ground work of the authors doing, has to much time passed and no one wants to co operate anymore? its been over 30 years, im sure the clues and memories of all involved are drying up to a point, a good read of something that is already out there, i was hoping for more insight."
1,Book has major Discrepancy!!!!,"When I started reading this book, I was overjoyed at all the information apparently going into this book of every minute detail and read the entire thing, only to find out at the end, that all of what I just read may or may not have been true! Needless to say, I was upset! I got all the way to page 423 before I found a discrepancy and a major discrepancy at that! Quote ""One day he opened the herald-Tribune and read the obituary of Wharhol's ex-muse Edie Sedgwick, who had died in California of an overdose of barbiturates. End quote. WRONG! Jim died before Edie! As you can see, I'm pretty upset about this and because of this have wondered if anything I have read was real or not! So, in conclusion, I have to totally disregard this book and move on to more viable sources! Stephen Davis, you suck! You really had me going!"
2,Fairy Tales,"The book was quite entertaining and included a number of stories I hadn't read before, some of which may even be true. The number of obvious and glaring factual errors give it a credibility somewhere short of Mother Goose."
3,Some good nuggets...,"A good summary of what most people in ministry already immersed in a postmodern/postchristian culture understand. Well articulated though - a few highlights for me...- The real beauty of experiential education is that it places trust in the learner to derive meaning from his or her experience. As a learning environment is created, the active focus shifts from the educator to the student.- Truth divorced from experience will always dwell in the realms of doubt. (Henry Drause)- We were created with a curiosity, a complexity, and a need for meaning- Whether we are Christian's or not, our hearts were created to vibrate with the story of God.- Every child is an artist. The child is how to remain an artist once he grows up (Pablo Picasso)- Never let formal education get in the way of your learning (Mark Twain)- Embracing this new mode of communication means worship becomes collaboration, faith now becomes a journey, and the gospel is now communicated in multiple forms of media"
5,great duck sauce,this is a gret product i use it on chicken turkey and pork roasts also excellent with chinese food buy it a lot of bang for your buck
2,Don't bother with this one...,"I would encourage you NOT to buy or even rent this video for that matter. The video cover claims that it has a candid, unscripted side of Angle in the video. Well to be honest, there is nothing of the sort. Angle remains in character for the entire video which runs about an hour and ten minutes all together. The video itself basically covers Angle's first year in the WWF thru ALL of his PPV matches up until No Mercy. The only thing that made this video earn two stars was the comments about Kurt Angle from other stars. Jerry Lawler, Steven Richards, Tazz, Steve Blackman, Rikishi and the Brooklyn Brawler all share there thoughts about Angle (All in character I might add). This is a poor video and the false claims on the back of the video make it even worse."
2,It's Boring! It's Boring!,"I expected this video to be like an autobiography of Kurt Angle, showing him as a child, growing up, through his Olympic days, all the way to the WWF. This was not the case.The video is pretty much a non-stop clip of Kurt Angle's highlight matches in the WWF. Not a bad video for someone who missed those matches, but it's nothing new at all. Anyone who taped the Pay Per Views has most of the footage already.Another annoying concept of the video was having Kurt Angle stay in character. Why not show the real side of Kurt Angle? That's what we want to see. We see enough of the Kurt Angle character on TV every week. How about showing us the Kurt Angle behind the scenes, that we don't know much about (except for the Olympic Gold Medals).This video was a bummer. Hopefully the WWF will release a video about the Real Kurt Angle, not the character."
1,Bach Reader...for Ph.D.'s,"First of all before I get attacked by JS Bach music lovers, I consider myself one as well. But, I didn't like this book. From the reviews I read I had high expectations, but I was extremely disappointed. I found possibly 5 quotations that were interesting or amusing. The majority of this book deals with musical terms and definition that can only be understood by musical composers or students, not for an average reader. Letters are written by Bach providing recommendations for his students, receipts for goods received, and his acceptance of a position for organist. How this is interesting to anyone, I failed to grasp."
3,"Wnat to like it, but had a hard time following it","In principle I really like the Sedona Method, but the book was hard to read - a bit wordy and hard to follow. But I really like Hale Dwoskin, too, and would consider watching a video or DVD (or seeing him live). The book just wasn't as readable as I need it to be. I personally prefer Byron Katie and the Work, but I think there's room for both. I definitely think the methodology is wonderful, though!"
3,"Book was ok, video course is better","I thought the book was ok but just like the current audio course its got so many different things in it that were not in the original course. When Lester Levenson was still alive and in charge the course was split over 2 weekends and in my opinion was much better. I did not get to go to a live course back then but i have the original 2 weekend course on video and its so much better. It teaches you how to just release, gives you a week in between to practice and then takes you into the deeper stuff such as the wants."
5,One of the better self-help books out there,"I first bought this book last year during some tough trials. I can safely say that it has made a tremendous difference in my life so far. It talks about a method that some of use to release our tension and let go of our problems. Some of us use the method without even being aware of it, but once you do, it can accelerate your healing. It has a great simplicity about it, but don't let that downplay its impact and importance. My life has been changed for the better, in leaving a job that wasn't bringing me fulfillment. I've heard that Sedona is a beautiful town in Arizona, where Sedona Method retreats are planned. I plan on going and learning all I can about the Sedona Method in the future."
5,Based on Profound Spiritual Principles,"I am a long time student of deep spiritual Truth. Don't let the self-help image of the Sedona Method fool you...it is based on deep, profound spiritual principles that WILL transform your life. It takes the principles taught by Byron Katie and Eckhart Tolle and others and simplifies them into a simple practice...so simple. Release your thoughts and go back to your natural state...peace and joy. It is too bad that the focus of the book appears to be on changing your external life...it goes much deeper than that. Use it...diligently. To understand it's depth read more about Lester Levenson...he has books available on Amazon."
2,NOT a USA Product,"I have two electronic air pressure gauges that I have no confidence in because they appear to be flimsy and were manufactured in China. I was told by several sources that the line of mechanical gauges from the GH Meiser company are accurate, well constructed, and produced in the USA. I ordered the Accu-Gage 0-100 lb dial gauge with bleeder hose, and the first thing I saw when it arrived was MADE IN CHINA!! I will never use this thing on anything high pressure, or an application where accuracy may be critical."
3,wrong pressure scale,"Unfortunately, the gauge's scale is 0-60 lb instead of the stated 0-100 lb. Such a hassle to return. Seems to work OK, however."
5,"Excelent, hot, fun, sexy shoe","I love this shoe. I have it in 3 different colors. Always get compliments on them. High heel, but not uncomfortable at all!"
3,"Great sound track, though it is missing several songs......","I bought this album because it sounded great in-game. It has most of the music but it is missing atleast 8 or 9 tracks...including the main title! I don't understand why Bungie would leave out these beautiful compositions.Other than the lack of music, the music on the disc is great. I enjoy listening to them over and over. Some people are complaining about the music being too different from the first game. For the most part almost all the music has more bass and is in a kinda remixed format, like rap.I recommend it to all halo enthusiasts."
5,best video game soundtrack ever.,"i understand that many people are a bit angry with breaking benjamin and hoobastank being in here. i'm not particularly happy myself with the last track, but i think contemporary music is appropriate here, albeit lyrics may not be the greatest form of expressing the mysterious feeling behind everything. i think o'donnel and salvatori have what it takes to compose a score of music, but it's not a score, it's a soundtrack. i found that if you don't like them you can just skip them. the second to last track is a great way to end the soundtrack."
3,NOT BAD FOR A CARTOON,"Though I've not watched STARBLAZERS or CAPTAIN HARLOCK for 20 years, DNA SIGHTS 999.9 is decent, if you're into that dramatic ""space opera"" stuff. Man, that villainous chick is hot! If I had a daughter that looked like her, well... I'd be in jail!! So, if Leiji Matsumoto's work is (to quote Austin Powers) ""Your bag, baby"", then order DNA SIGHTS 999.9."
5,Class Act2,"I was truly amazed at the content of the stories in this anthology. Some are brutal and graphic, but they are not lacking for truth. It was painful to read some of the stories and accounts of slave life. I had to wonder what type of people could implement such a vile and dehumanizing institution, and force a race of human beings to submit to such treatments that they themselves would not, and could not endure. The authors deserve an incredible amount of credit, not only for their contributions, but for their bravery in writing and ultimately allowing the publishing of these stories. No telling how much is still out there that has not been, and probably won't be published."
3,Only bought because it was required,I only bought this because it was required. I was excited to learn more about AfroAmerican history but the book is kind of dry to read.
2,A lesson in how not to mix an album,"It's a total giveaway, isn't it? When the guitarist ""remixes"" old demo's and rerecords the guitar parts is anyone really surprised when the vocals and bass become inaudible beneath the ego of the man at the faders? No, not really. Which is a shame as it happens, as this album is potentially full of great songs dragged into the late nineties with all the productions whizz-bangs at Paul Chapman's disposal. Sadly we will never know how great they might have sounded as this sounds like Mr. Chapman was demoing his playing and not his song-writing ability. It's clear to me he holds both Pete Way and Danny Vaughn in contempt. If you want to know how these two fine musicians really sound, buy some ""UFO"" (Pete Way) or better still get some ""Tyketto"" or ""Vaughn"". Better songs, better production (and if you get the right albums) better guitar playing. 2 out of 5 says it all. Avoid this like you'd avoid something really horrible on the pavement that you don' want to step in."
4,The damages a gossip makes,"In spite of all the negative critics about ""Gossip"", I really enjoyed this movie. The plot is interesting and shows the damages a simple gossip can produce. ""Gossip"" is not a regular teenage movie, with beautiful faces and no plot. The cast was very well chosen and the soundtrack is good."
3,great sound but...,installed this muffler on my '06 Subaru Impreza 2.5i and it sounds great. not overly loud either. would definitely recommend to anyone! Update: about 2 years later the muffler cracked because it was completely rusted so it was replaced with a T904 which actually sounds better. don't think i'll be buying another flowmaster again.
4,Very realistic movie,"First I read the book. Then I saw the movie. I was very pleased by the result of the movie. It shows how being gay in Latin American countries really is. It shows how society behaves when dealing with homosexuality issues. Being gay and from Mexico I felt really identified by this movie. I really liked it for being real. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I bought the DVD edition, and they don't take advantage of this technology, they don't add 'interviews' or 'comentaries of the director, produces or actors'. But the movie, it's very honest and real, and Santiago Magill -the main character- is really cute ;-) Ah! and the movie shows nudity."
5,Wow! An awesome Anime....,"This is one of the best Anime I have ever witnessed. Not only is the Anime in general great, but this is one of my favorite videos of the series. Episode 14 is, in my opinion, the best episode of the entire series. Not only is the battle spectacular, but the events that are caused by it are just mind-boggling. I say, get this video right away! ^_^"
4,Great Album,"The third album of hungarian hc band freshfabrik. the sounds are much better than on the other two. the song ""drive my hand"" is absolutely amazing. i strongly recommend this album."
5,Great holster; second one of these I own.,"Actually, the Model 15706 is Right Hand draw, black, for S&W; J-frames so ignore the picture.I also own one of the Black Widow holsters for a S&W; 9-mm semiautomatic. Both are well made and hold the firearm snugly in. In other words, the grip does not hang outwards away from the side of your torso causing it to print against your clothing. Effective and comfortable use does (like every other on-waistband carry) require a good 2-inch belt."
1,Waste of time...,"The other negative reviews pretty much spell it out, why did I not listen to them. There are some critics that create heated debates as to the weight of their opinion (Bangs, Marcus, etc), but this guy is just bad. I think this book is made for teenagers who can't read more than a page or two without getting bored. I traded it in for a good book on Marvin Gaye, so the experience wasn't all bad."
1,cap,the packaged arrived pretty quick but the hat wasnt what i expected...more pics of the cap would have been nice?
1,This thing is awful!!!,"The girls are definitely sub-Playboy quality. Most of them look and act like cheap street walkers. If you're into trashy women, that's cool. But that's not what I expect from Playboy. Playboy is supposed to show you the finest of the fine ... and this ain't it! I was very disappointed, to say the least. I threw the DVD away after scanning through it one time. Save your money."
3,Only Fair,"The ""trip"" mechanism on both units was out of alignment. I had to bend and re-shape the rods to get them to work. Also, a chipmunk managed to escape after being trapped. I assume he squeezed thru the space between the cage and the door.- J."
2,I havent caught a thing with it so far,"I read the reviews and most everyone seem to have no problem with catching many squrriels, with peanut butter on a cracker stuck to the tray. But i am begining to wonder if they smell the human scent and dont come near it. Or maybe they hid it under something that masked the human scent and the trap itsefl. Has anyone got any ideas?"
3,Not as good as the 1062,I purchased this from Home Depot and returned it after one day. I uses metal levers to do everything and they are crude. I replaced it with the Havahart 1062 which uses metal braided wire and a magnetic handle trip mechanism. I caught 4 squirrels with the 1062 in 3 days. The 1062 rocks.
3,Trap door pain to open and setup,Got it with the door clashing against the cage so needed to bend the cage/door to provide enough clearance to open/close. I setup in the attic space to catch critters crawling but didn't catch squat! An animal once set the trap doors but some how escaped. Only used few times so I guess time will tell..
1,Not very reliable,"I use this to trap squirrels. The bait pan isn't very sensitive. Even when it is sprung, one of the doors does not close entirely and the animals escape. It's OK when used as a single door trap. But those are harder to attract squirrels since one door must remain shut at all times, and some squirrels may then be too cautious to enter."
3,Havahart cage for squirrels,"This cage is to small for a squirrel it will work for a rat but the squirrels can get out, the tail sticks out which keeps the trap door open. Also it is hard to set the trip on it, does not set on uneven ground. It works but I wish I had returned it I have squirrel problems not rats."
3,This trap is Fair,"This trap is too small for rabbits which claim its for, I would get the next size up. Also setting it is a little tricky because if you don't have the sensitivity just right the animal will not set it off. Maybe mine had a flaw in it. Don't know."
2,Not Good Enough!,I have had this trap for one year now & I am not happy with it. Either this trap is lame or I have the smartest flying squirrels in Branscomb California.I bait this trap in every way possible & all I do is feed the squirrels. The trip plate just isn't sensitive enough. After one year all I have caughtis a rat. The flying squirrels just come in & eat away & never get caught. I have tried many modifications including blocking off one of the doors stillno help. I'm going to try the single door model to see if it can do any better. Either this is a lame trap or my squirrels are smart! Go Figure!
