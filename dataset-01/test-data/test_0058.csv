2,not very sticky,This tape is not very sticky! If you need it to stick...your out of luck! I wish I could return it easier!
2,whats up with this?,in what sporting event would a flying camera be pointed at the stairs and not the center of the action?
5,One Heck of an Excellent Film,"What can I say? This is a great movie! I saw it 4 times in the theater and have an authentic movie poster framed in my room. No sooner did this come out, and I had to get it. The camera shots are new and very smooth to the eye. It's easy to follow, unlike some mysteries. Great movie!"
2,a silly goof-January 7- Kabb,"Come on people can you think of more of a thriller than this worthless trash. This movie was way to obvious,about who assasianed the secertary of state. There were no good Performances except for the women that is sitting in the arena and suspected in the killing, but other than that it sucked."
2,"A tame no surprises hear , boring thriller .",Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise are both great actors but why theydecided to star in this lame thriller is beyond me. After the 30minute continuous shot it just slopes downhill. Cage and Sinise both act well but whats the point its like being able to swim when trying to drown yourself. Its worth seeing for the first 30 minutes but after that you may aswell go for a walk or something.
2,"Not a , mystery or thriller, it's an action adaventure.",Your about 20 minutes into the movie when the person gets killed. then it's another 30 when you found out who was doing it. And trust me no big surprise. After that it was confusingly bad.
2,"Same old, same old","Nicolas Cage is such a talented actor (Leaving Las Vegas being his best work to date), and he is totally underutilized in trite movies like this one. This was merely a class B film. There was nothing new about the plot: the conspiracy theory, the corrupt cop, the damsel in distress... Cage does a decent job, but the movie did not help him show his talents."
3,???,"this movie left me confused. the first half or so is a mystery. the second part deals with telling you exactly what happened & wrapping the whole thing up in under 100 minutes. so it's not a mystery at all by my definition. if this is truly the way brian de palma planned it, then i would be surprised. it's too explicit in terms of the amount of information you get. but rent it anyway."
1,Whats All The Fuss About?,"Well I must admit I am no real fan of Nicolas Cage but take ""The Rock"" for example that was a great movie with a believable plot and stunning effects .... but with this movie its was so stupid! no real story and Cage should be given an award for over acting was this a comedy or what?In summary it was weak with a story line that wasnt ever going to take your anywhere,all I can say is thank god I didnt buy it."
1,Terrible Headset,"I bought this headset recently and was amazingly disappointed with it almost immediately. Other than a stylish design, this headset has no upside. The sound quality is terrible, even for the price. The mic is worthless; in all my attempts to use it in gaming(what this headset was purportedly designed for) failed utterly. People were unable to make out my voice at all. Don't waste your time buying this trash, you'll just have to return it and replace it within days."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I was looking for a decent pair of headphones to use for a program called TeamSpeak. My outfit on a game called Planetside uses it to do faster communication. After comparing prices, this was the cheapest and, because of the trusted name of Logitech on the side, I thought I could trust these headphones were of decent quality.Wrong, goes to show me once again, ALWAYS READ THE REVIEWS! My troubles started when people couldn't hear me unless I shouted to the heavens even after I had the settings on the highest they could go to boast performance. Next was the horrible design. After 30 minutes my ears started to hurt because there was no support for the headphones, which pulled and pinched my ears. The sound quality is fine, but unless I held the mic close to my face, it wouldn't pick up, which is impractical to gamers.I plan on returning these less then 24 hours of purchasing them and to buy something decent that I reviewed this time. What a waste of money."
2,Pass on these. . .,"On the plus side, they worked. . . on the down side, everything else. Uncomfortable, and everyone in the room hears them even if the volume is low. Did I mention uncomfortable? These also take up a ton of room in a drawer. Definitely pass on these!"
2,it is not how i expected,in fact this headphone is good qualified but the problem is uncomfortable. in one hour it make my ears painful and the bad thing is head band goes around almost from backneck..anyway i still use it but it depends on for what purpose u gonna use it ...
5,Excellent Headphones,"I purchased these headphones at the end of July 2006 and since then they've been very handy. They don't hurt at all, and the sound pickup is good too. I give this product an A+"
2,Bad value for the price,"I just bought these the other day for use on World of Warcraft, and I must say I am greatly disappointed.The microphone, for no reason, would cut out at times, and didn't have much sensitivity to pick up my voice at times unless I was cupping my hands around the actual voice reader. This was not a sensitivity issue with the program I was using, as I had the voice register set to max.Also, the voice on/off switch was delicate and easy to accidently brush on/off against clothing or my desk.The earpieces themselves began to hurt after an hour of use, but I have found this problem with several headphones in the past which fully cover my ears.The only perks are that the cord is long, and thus I didn't have to move my CPU around as I've had to do for other sets. Also, it's very easy to use - no software at all, just plug in and go.After only one night of use, however, I'm already browsing for an alternative set."
4,Where Are We,"This is a very interesting movie with plenty of suspense and nerve wrecking adventures. Something worth watching and buying for the usual dvd buyers that want something different in their liberaries.Very entertaining and good to see this show, Horror,science fiction mixed into one a must see to understand the movie."
5,Another Great Japanimation Series.,Definetly a must have for the japanimation lover. Has Great characters and a great storyline. Will watch this series many times through years to come.
3,Disappointed,"According to item description, I believed I was purchasing a CD with multiple tracks by the Hinsons, including the song ""The Lighthouse"". What I received was an accompaniment track for singing ""The Lighthouse"". Not at all what I expected to give as a gift for a fan of The Hinsons."
3,"Not bad, but not all that great.","A mysterious figure known only as The Gentleman gathers together Doc Ock, Mysterio, The Vulture, Electro and The Chameleon to form the Sinister Six. The sixth member is Pity, The Gentleman's mentally troubled, but no less lethal, henchperson. The true plan is for four of the Six to keep Spidey busy, while the other two conduct a robbery of a sort.As entertaining as Revenge of the Sinister Six is (and boy do they get their revenge on poor Spidey), the book is hampered by some flaws. One, it is overwritten and reads as rather talky at times. Two, there are numerous errors sprinkled throughout the BP paperback edition, the proofing was quite poor. Three, there are several pop culture injokes that detract from the story, rather than enhance it.Those problems aside, fans of Spider-Man will no doubt enjoy the two hundred page slugfest that is the Sinister Six's Day of Terror."
4,A great collection of 70s pop songs,"These might not be the 13 songs I would choose as the greatest radio hits of the 70s, but this is a great collection, especially since I got it for $5. Listen to the samples; I'll bet you'll recognize (and probably like) a few of these songs even if you weren't around back then."
2,Usually a fan of CD,"Sheesh, I must be the only person who was disappointed. I am a fan of her other work with historicals... and that's in spite actually preferring contemporaries. I figured this would be GREAT.I found it dull, a bit too silly and rather disjointed. The characters just never engaged me. I never finished the last chapter as I just didn't care to see how it finally turned out."
5,Christina Goes Contemporary!,"Dodd's book is fun and engaging! She's done an excellent job with this book! More, more, more!"
2,ehhhh!!!,"Well, I did not really like either character, but the hero was such a cold fish. I could'nt really sense any love between them just convenience. So this wasn't a terrible book but it surely did not live up to the Governess Bride series we have all come to know and love.Sorry MS. Dodd please try again."
1,metaphysical mumbo-jumbo,"I bought the Nightingale Connant edition of this title, thinking that I would get some scientific information about mind-body healing. Instead, it was full of New Age metaphysics about past lives, reincarnation, spirit guides, angels, out of body experiences, and the like. If I had known this in advance, I would not have spent the money."
5,Amazing Spanish Guitar Play!,"Do not be surprised. Steve does not use electric guitars at all in this album. However, he proves that his passion can be expressed by acorstic guitar. Rather his A-guitar playing is a better way to present his brilliant guitar technique.The variation of each tune makes us happy, too.This should be the masterpiece."
5,"Character-driven, action-packed, solidly-plotted fantasy.","Again, solidly-plotted with plenty of action and adventure and introducing more memorable characters who mesh well with the lead characters from the first book. Particularly, we see more of the nonhuman population of this planet. Plus, Fancher's world-building skills are as good as her character developing skills are! (One of my favorite aspects of sf/f!)--Margaret Adamson Fincannon"
3,Someone mixed and matched cast members with the wrong movie,"I see Charles Dutton and Charles Dance listed as a few of the cast members, and even a comment about pulling the Queen into the molten lead. First of all, the Queen was in Ripley's chest; the Alien which got fried wasn't a Queen. Second, this description - along with the names Charles Dance and Charles Dutton - go with Alien 3, not Aliens."
4,A good action movie,"Yes, ""Aliens"" is a good action movie but people, wake up!!!! There is only one original ""Alien"" and that's it!! No director can beat the outstanding vision of Ridley Scott, and besides thanks to Mr. Cameron, soon we will have ""Alien 25"". It's all a joke now, in every new part the original story and ideas are twisted so bad that it hurts. I am glad that there is no sequel to ""Close encounters of the third kind""."
2,A so so DVD,"The movie of Aliens on this DVD is really nice. The extra 17 minutes of footage fill in pieces of the plot and make the movie have a better more rounded plot. Almost worth the DVD itself.However, I said almost...There are no good extra's on this DVD. No directors commentary, in fact, there are no commentaries at all on this DVD!What extra's there are on this DVD are pathetic; Some short home footage of the model of the Base and Atmosphere Processor on LV-426, and how the Face Hugger, and Chest Burster mechanics work and a concept of the Alien Queen. There are also some stills from the movie and that's about it. I expected a whole lot more.As a movie, I would rate the 5 out of 5, but as a DVD, only 2 out of 5.Mr. James Cameron can make some really good movies, but his DVD's really stink in comparison to what other directors put on their DVD's.If your a hardcore Aliens fan, get this, other than that, spend your money on the Gladiator DVD since it is a much better DVD."
5,Let's Rock!!,"First time I saw the entire film was back in high school, when the film society somehow got their grubby mits on this movie. We were all blown away. I was pissed when they only released the director's cut on Laser Disc. Fortunately, we had a hi-fi fan at college who had the latest everything. It was cool seeing the restored footage again. However, the LD also had Cameron's comments, which were pretty important. As with the extra footage cut out of Terminator 2, Cameron had really good reasons to cut the extra bits out of the movie. Won't spoil the extra footage for those unfortunate enough to have missed seeing them, since this was mentioned in a previous comment here, but the tense scene with the automated sentries was cut because Cameron did not want to make the movie just about a war of attrition. Of course, the special edition should have been released earlier, but that goes without saying."
4,"Really a 5 star movie, but...","The DVD picture looks a bit rough and fuzzy at times, even in component video output. I suppose they are digital artifacts or film grains. The picture is very sharp in some places, but grainy in others, expecially when the background becomes dark. If you pause the DVD once in a while during the chapter when Ripley goes back into the complex to get the girl, you'll see what I mean. I watched the Alien DVD (first movie) on the same TV set and the picture stayed sharp in that one, none of this fuzzy stuff."
5,See LV-426 Full of Life!!!,"To see LV-426 teeming with life, before the Alien is introduced and wipes-out the ""shake-and-bake"" colony, is worth the price of the new Aliens: Special Edition. Hats off to Cameron and Fox for including the 17 minutes of additional footage to what I consider the finest sci-fi movie ever made. Also, the additional set-up with what happened to Ripley's 66-year-old daughter Amanda adds a crucial element to why she defends Newt with such determination and force. The disc is a must-have for all fans of the Alien series. Go out and buy that DVD player now!"
5,"Great service, Quick delivery",Thank you for the great service and quick delivery. I would purchase from vendor again.
3,extra footage takes away 2 stars,"I'm a big fan of the entire Alien series, and Aliens is my favorite of the 4 movies. The movie itself gets 5 stars. I am, however, extremely annoyed that I can't watch the movie without the 17 minutes of new footage. The new footage is completely unnecessary. Everything that the footage ""reveals"" (Ripley's maternal nature, the relationship with Hicks, etc.) is stuff that a discerning viewer would have been able to see from the original version of the film. All the extra footage does is make me appreciate the role of the film's editor, who did a pretty good job the first time around. Perhaps someday people will realize that just because you *can* pack a lot of stuff on a DVD, doesn't mean you *should.* Sometimes it's best to leave well enough alone."
3,Additional scenes ruined the film,"I liked Alien as a film very much. Its claustrophobic sequel was something else - more or less an action film in SF environment, and a very good action at that. The reason I'm writing this is because I want to share my dissatisfaction with Director's Cut version of the film. Additional scenes slowed down the film in some places (e.g. the beginning, Ripley's recovering and facing reality), enfeebled the emotional impact (aliens are not all that dangerous after the sentry guns' scenes) and worst of all, removed any kind of implicitness from the film (a) Ripley's daughter, b) we know what happened with the colony right from the beginning). DC is not the film I've seen in the theater, but rather a much weaker version of it. I would not have had it in my collection if it had not been by an accident, and I do hope that one day the studio publishes the original film on DVD."
4,I need to clarify this ...,"The Director's cut is the BEST version. The extra 17 minutes some people complaining about are essential, not only to understand Ripley's relation with Newt, but also to the complete saga, the development of Ripley's psyche. I think these scenes never should have been deleted in the first place, cause they make the characters more human and sympathetic."
4,Strange and entertaining,"This is a truely strange and entertaining work. There are aspects of Manchester's writing style that will seem to be a ""rip off"" of various lines and themes from various horror films, but overall the book is informative of the work of a modern-day vampire hunter. If you're wondering if Manchester is dead (!) serious about his work as an exorcist and vampire slayer, he definitely is. BTW--if any reader wishes to purchase this book without having to remortgage the farm, go to Amazon.com's UK site, where you can get it for under $38.00 (19.99). No need to put up with State-side price gouging."
1,Go for Montague instead!,"It is fairly obvious that this book was written by a nut!!! A pale reminder of Bram Stoker's Dracula. For the real stuff, read Montague Summers. 0;)))))"
4,Go fish!,"No twist on this game, standard ""Go Fish"" but if you like Dr. Seuss you need a copy. Nice graphics right from the original text. Lots of fun for the whole family."
4,a fun and rockin' ride,"the best thing about ""rock""-is when u play it loud-like it should b played-u hear that guitar -and guitars-that form a bed and cushion of guilty pleasures of solid rock and roll-this is a fun romp for eltons' new band-this is one of the few albums-besides his live releases-that he lets loose-and shows us what a rocker and good time boy he can b-enjoy this and buy it-cause i don't think u will b hearing anything like this from him in the future-but who knows?-elton is full of surprises-some great rock and roll-some good funk-even a lone ballad-all fits together in this package-to me?-this is elton at his ""commercial prime""-if u want to party and have fun and rock with elton-this is the ultimate ej party album-and a good one at that-check it out--------"
3,CLASSIC ELTON IT AIN'T,"I consider myself a really big ELTON JOHN fan and this album is just lousy .In context it's a bit more rocky than the 1970 -1975earlier lps.But after listen to this album even after many of his lesser ""hit albums"" it just doesn't do it for me now or then.ISLAND GIRL though a big top 40 hit is down right corny.I really don't give a hoot about DAN DARE or the STREET KIDS.The only saving grace is I FEEL LIKE A BULLET..On a possitive note SUGAR ON THE FLOOR one of the cd extras is a vocal beauty and a really nice song written by kikie dee.The other down side is that this was the first album without the likes of NIGEL OLSSON and DEE MURRAY"
4,second best to the jam,"The ""mod"" movement of the late 70's in England was bound to die as are all fads. Most of the ""mod"" music that came out of that period stunk (secret affair, lambrettas, etc). The Chords were different. Even though they wore the mod uniform, musically they held a lot in common with some of the more punk bands. I think that they are the closest I've heard to the Damned. Anyway, the album is fantastic. It's full of teenage anthems that carry with you all day long. For those of you just beginning to explore the mod scene, this is a must to your collection."
5,Great Refrigerator Thermometer,"I am very pleased with this thermometer. The temperature dials on most refrigerators are less than precise. If set too high the contents of the fridge may freeze, too low and bacteria may be a problem. For $6 I now have piece of mind."
2,"Good ideas, bad book","Per Bak's ideas (and ideas of others that are occasionally presented without quoting the original sources) are remarkably interesting, but the book itself seems to be a product of an uncontrolled avalanche in author's brain. Too low rigor and signal-to-noise to be interesting scientifically, too poorly written to be read as fiction - sorry, two stars. A 10-page summary could have done much better."
2,Per Bak is overwhelmed by his own enthusiasm for his theory,"Per Bak came up with a nice theory for complex systems. Potentially it has wide ranging implications, however it remains speculative at the moment. I think SOC will in time come to be a useful tool for describing a broad class of complex systems however I doubt it will ever reach the hyperbole given in this book. Unfortunately Bak's turned this book into a sales pitch for his theory, forgotten any pretense of reasoned arguement and so spoiled what could of been a good popular science book on what is a extremely interesting are.If you are of a slightly mathematical bent get Jensen's book. There you will get a reasoned account of what SOC has given us and what is has not even if you skip some of the derivations. Balance is something you won't find in Bak's book."
1,Save your Money!,The author amazingly manages to be neither funny or informative. I would rather have thrown the money out of the window of a moving car. That would be far more entertaining.
5,This book answered many questions for me.,"What a lot of helpful information, and it's written so average folks like me can understand it! My family is having fun sharing photos from our family reunion, and this book made it so much easier. Other books I've seen assume I know things I don't know. If you want to create a Web site but aren't sure how, I recommend this book."
2,Should have known beter.,I did read the other reviews before I bought this thing and did not listen to them. It started leaking water out of the bottom of the pump and drained most of my water out of the pool. I bought it 06/14/2009 and today is 8/02/09 so you get the point. I don't know what else you could buy for these pools as far as pumps go. I would search high and low for another brand before I bought this one. Now I have to get on the phone with intex to see if they will honor the warranty.Good Luck everyone
1,Pool Pump,"Low marks only because this is not a toy, so the questions do not pertain. Pump is great, super price, fast shipping and came with a lot of extras that I didn't expect. Would buy another one today if needed."
3,Less than expected,"I needed to get another pump for my 15 ft pool (Intex). It said however that it was made for my pool. It is not! The hoses and equipment are for a much larger hole than what my pool was. In fact If I were to go and buy another pool this size I'd have the same problem. Then to be told I'd have to buy an adapter for $20 more is more like misrepresentation. No where in the description does it say how large the diamenter of the hose attachment opening it fits. Very deceptive on their part. All in all I had to put aside the clean out plungers and get a hose change kit at the local Ace hardware. It works good (the pump) but connections leak a little as they were a make shift idea. Oh well, live and learn."
4,pool pump,"I bought this pump to replace the pump that I purchased to replace the one that came with my above ground pool. Had to cut the openings on the pool to fit the new fittings... if done carefully and slowly there should be no problems. But anyhow I love this new pump, wished I had bought it first... the other one only lasted 6 weeks. I have told friends and family about this one and I know of at least 2 that have already ordered one."
1,"Junk, Buy the 2500 gallon Pump","This pump came with our intex pool from costco. A great value for a pool, but this pump only lasted one 3 month season before the infamous impeller blades did what they all seem to do and ate themselves to death. Spend the extra $20 and buy the 2500 gallon pump instead, this is a complete waste of money."
4,Review,Works very well with pool I have....I have an Easyset 2 ft pool.....My orignial pump died so i bought this one. Has a timer to set for easy filtering of pool. So far no problems with it at all...
2,"Intex ""they call them toys"" pool pumps.","This pump is now the fourth one in less than a year. The first one went bad after a month or so. They sent me a new one at no cost. That one lasted about a month and I had to pay $18.00 shipping to get another. The third one I ran maybe an hour a day and that lasted about three months. To bad they said, ship it back at another $18.00 So I decided to upgrade to this pump. As soon as it was online it sounded terrible. I am nursing it along only running it for the minimum of two hours per day. I figure it will also quit soon, again, due to the impeller. They wont sell just the impeller. It's always a differrent reason, depends on which rep. you talk too. Don't believe anything they say, it's all B.S.Good luck with you're experience! Gary Tyler@ [...] or gttyler@cfl.rr.com"
1,Product Description This is perfect pump upgrades that come packaged with your 16' or smaller size Intex pool set.,"OK, so upset!I bought this thinking it was for smaller pools when it clearly states on the box for 18' and over sized pool. So it will not work. It looks like a very nice pump though, sturdy.Have to find a way to send it back, what a pain!"
4,does what it needs to!,"ordered this pump cause i dropped the other and it wouldnt work, ordered it tuesday, arrived on thursday (today), love the super fast shipping....we were able to swim after less than 5 minutes of installing it. these pumps arent designed for years, but it does good for running it a couple hours a day, last one, i had for 3 years....came with tubing, plunger assembly parts etc...AND a filter in it....pleasant surprise cause i didnt wanna make a trip to the store for one!"
1,Poor impeller design,"I bought the 18' pool Mar 07. I am on my third pump (under warranty) as the impellers kept breaking the blades (likely because of the poor filter design). No way to just replace the impeller so now my THIRD pump impeller blades went. On some sites you can see that for 2008 they have a new impeller design (probably cost too much replacing warranty broken impellers). I am upgrading to 2500 or 4000 gph pump. Still researching but want to HIGHLY discourage buying any of the 635 pumps, definitely if they are not the ""new"" impeller design for 2008 and even then Im not going to buy one!"
3,good for basic use; design not refined,"i purchased for office use. everyone likes the size and weight. it works fine as a replacement for basic use.however, the wheel is buried too deep. you cannot wheel it easily, i found myself had to use finger tip more often. especially annoying is when i use the wheel click to open/close files, i have to press hard while trying not to accidently press the right button. and the wheel is too mechanical (""stiff"" was the word). it is not very comfortable to use.it is cheap and works well. but i am looking for something better."
3,AUTHENTICITY AS SEEN BY VARIOUS EXISTENTIALISTS,"Jacob GolombIn Search of Authenticity:From Kierkegaard to Camus(New York: Routledge, 1995) 219 pages(ISBN: 0-415-11946-4; hardcover)(ISBN: 0-415-11947-2; paperback)(Library of Congress call number: B105.A8G65 1995)Authenticity as found in the thought of:Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, & Camus.Academic rather than existential,but an important contribution to the very slim literature on Authenticity.If these thinkers' versions of Authenticity interest you,you will want to read this volume.If you want to read other books on this existential theme,search the Internet for: ""Authenticity Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
3,Universal Soldier,"This film in the blu-ray format has been given a new lease of life, with the actors looking fresh faced and very 21st century. Van Damme looking at his physical best is eye candy for the ladies, and the overall action sequences entertaining for all. Unusual location shots enhance the enjoyment of the film and the quality is of a new cinema release. Its more action movie than strictly sci-fi but definitely worth a watch in the blu-ray format for Van Damme fans and far better than the original release due to its high definition."
5,Transcend Jetflash v30,This is a very neat and durable drives. I bought online for several of my friends and they seem to love it. I think the bet thing about it is its durability. A good product to buy.
4,Great Drive I'll just.....wheres the cap!?,"I've owned a few flash drives, and a problem I consistently have is loosing the cap, don't worry though. It defiantly isn't because the cap falls off, it's nice and sturdy and the drive itself does the job just fine. But I tend to loose the cap fairly often as the cap is so small it makes a dime jealous, with the given size of a flash drive the cap should be attached or something to prevent this from happening. But I digress, here is a quick break down.PRO:No memory issuesHole for lanyard or necklace makes for convenient carryFair price for amount of GBCON:Constantly loose the cap"
3,"Another early, unexplained flash drive death","Like another customer this product died after a little over a month. 1.5 gbs of data are now gone. I was using it on a daily basis at work, and for no apparent reason, one morning when I plugged it into my PC, it just would not work. I have tried it on other PCs & laptops, and am able to use the ports with other flash drives, so it is definitely a problem with the drive. For the month it was working, I absolutely loved it, it is extremely fast. I don't know how frequently those that have given this drive great reviews were using it, but this is the first drive I have ever had that has completely failed to respond, and as I said, I was using it for multiple hours daily."
4,Great value!,"This flash drive is the same size as the 1, 2, and 4 gig comparable ones, but with a slightly faster read/write speed. It's definitely worth paying the extra $5-10 for the fast read/write speed.I haven't utilized all of the software features of ""Mobile email"" and such, but sounds like it's quite advanced."
5,Really good book,I enjoyed reading Twilight Of Fury since I was a B24 navigator with the 15th Air Force in Italy.
5,A Powerful Story,"Twilight Of Fury is a gripping tale wrought with such realism that it sweeps you into the story. Only a really good film has ever stolen time like this book. For the action, the air combat scenes were so real you almost believe you flew those missions. For the drama, you will understand what life was like in World War II. And you'll understand someone struggling with insanity, anger and hate.Tom is most guys I know. Molly and Mary are kind of like a lot of girls I've known. Twilight Of Fury makes you see and understand why guys and girls have different perspectives."
4,Live action vs. Anime,"Ok first of all, this movie is Live action. Your not gonna get the gore quality of Anime without kickin out some serious bucks. Had George Lucas and his movie entourage taken over this production then many of the opinions written here would be justifiable. Unfortunately it wasn't, so what are we left with? A decent dialogue, extremely well rehearsed fight sequences that smack of John Woo, and a very good storyline. Gary Daniels and Costas pair off very well together. If you want a Hot action movie then this is the one for you."
1,THIS IS NOT THE ANIMATED VERSION!!!,"This is almost certainly the ""live action"" version that was made a few years ago, which was absolutely horrible. Even if I'm wrong, and it IS the anime version, it only has the dubbed English soundtrack (see technical notes). Spare yourself the pain, and DO NOT BUY THIS!"
2,fist of the north star,the story kept with the cartoon. the martial arts was a bit too much with that final blow. it was just so so.
3,Older but fun,"Fist of the North Star is an older movie that is a lot of fun if not taken too seriously. It has a good cast, good effects and a great story. The acting leans more to the ""B-movie"" side of things and is very graphic making it an entertaining movie."
4,good solid album,"as for as production this album is one of the best this year by far and his lyrics are tight as well . people dont give joe much credit, this album has to be a top ten of the year"
3,This is a very decent album,the production is tight and fat joe stepped his game up from his last album i feel.yes he did a track with paris hilton. this is what he does to make a living. It was probably a huge pay check. we all live in the real world. Bills need to be payed.And atmosphere manfans are gonna hate because he did a track with the same sample they used. (which often happens in hiphop)ignore the haters. This is a good album.
4,Excellant for changing your life style and losing weight.,I read this book years ago and I was able to lose over 100 pounds by using the life style changes it suggests. The book is entertaining and uses real life approaches and situations that occur in your normal everyday life. The book makes sense!
1,Picture went out after only 15 months!!!,"This video monitor always had an annoying buzzing sound I think because our cordless phone (in another room) interfered with it but because we loved being able to SEE our baby, we tried to ignore it. Then after only 15 months of use, the picture went out completely. I called Summer Infant direct and because there is only a 1 year warranty - they would fix it for us but there is a $43 dollar charge for it! I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want to spend $99 for only a little over a year of use."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I received the 1st monitor as a gift. I took it back because there was no picture. The 2nd monitor worked well for about 2 weeks. Then the neighbor's telephone started playing through the monitor at all hours of the day and night. It began to make a horrible hissing noise around 11PM every night. Sleep is precious in the early weeks and with a loud hissing noise there would be none. After a couple of nights I took this one back too and got a Safety 1st. It's not the best, but at least I don't have to move to an area with no portable phones for it to work."
2,"Reasonable Picture, Horrible Audio","We purchased the Quiet Sounds video monitor, and have received an audio monitor as a gift. The video portion of the monitor worked fine. As others have noted, the green diode does illuminate the baby quite a bit, and keeps her fascinated at times. At night, the picture quality dims, but we are able to tell if her eyes are open. However, turning off the monitor and using only the audio receiver (the video display lights up a bedroom at night) is not possible due to the background noise and popping. We have tried turning off or disconnecting all of the wireless technology in the house, to no avail. Even after I opened the units housing to adjust the gain/squelch controls, we found the noise level to be unacceptable."
2,Get the Handheld Color Video Monitor instead!!,I had this one and then returned it b/c of the poor reception. It worked ok at first and then it was impossible to get a clear picture-plus the knobs are really hard to turn b/c they are in the back of the monitor.The Handheld Color Video Monitor- also by the same company- was really easy to install and then the picture is right there on the lcd screen without ANY adjusting at all!! It's worth the extra $89.
3,"Picture good, sound not so good","I get a beautiful picture from anywhere in my large house - even in a very dark nursery. But the sound is always full of static. So I use it with the volume off and use my Sony sound monitor (which is awesome, by the way).Why bother then? Because it gives me the extra peace of mind I need to leave my daughter in her crib across the house. At 6 weeks old, she's not moving around much yet, but when she starts flipping over, it will be nice to check in on her and make sure she's not face down in a corner of the crib without getting out of my own bed.Bottom line, quality isn't great, but it's still worth it to me."
5,Cannot live w/o this product!,"This is the absolute must-have for any new parent. I'm about to buy my second for baby number two so that each child can have one! The picture is in black/white, but for the price you cannot beat the reception. I'm not sure why people would have problems with this...perhaps it has to do w/location. We're in a big city and have never had a problem with it. It's the best $100 I've ever spent...hands down!"
2,sound but no picture,I received this monitor for a shower gift. No matter where I put it I can't get a picture. I called the company and they want me to ship it back to them and they will ship me another one. I hope the new one works after reading the reviews it seems like they have some sort of problem with the monitors. It's very dissappointing.
1,Horrible Monitor,"This monitor is horrible, a big waste of money! The reception is awful. It makes loud static and noise all night long. While your baby may be sleeping, you cannot sleep with this monitor around! My mom got a cheap monitor free with other purchases and she has no problem with it at all. Our monitor just broke. My baby is a year old old and now the picture does not work. The screen is completely black and of course there is no warranty so we basically paid over one hundred dollars to use this monitor for a year. Now we're going to go buy a cheap one like my mom has. Trust me, save your money this monitor is no good!"
3,Too bright in a dark nursery,"I thought this monitor would work in the dark the way our Night Vision does on our video camera, where you can't even see the beam of infrared that allows it to pick up the image. It sort of does, but there is a fairly bright green light that shines from the part that goes in the nursery and it must be facing the baby for the monitor to pick up the image. It shines light directly all through her crib, like a sort of nightlight, only too bright for her to ignore. Maybe if we had started off with it, she'd never know the difference, but we got this now that she is pulling up in the crib, and she's old enough now to wonder what that light is, to keep staring at it, and NOT go back to sleep. Sadly, we'll have to return it for this reason. However, the reception was just fine. It's too bad it needed that much light to work."
2,okay if baby's room is next to yours,"I purchased this for my infant and the picture was horrible. We got a lot of fuzz and couldn't even distinguish our son from the fuzz. It could be that our room is too far away from our son's. We live in a split ranch home, so our rooms are on opposite sides of the house (that's WHY we wanted a video monitor) but it is also the reason why the monitor did not work for us. Bummer..."
2,Not a good option,"I can't understand how people rate this as a good problem. Also, I cannot understand how they can name it QUIET. It's not quite at all. We have had lots of interference problems with it. The video is ok if you find the exact position for the antenna but the sound is terrible. We really can't rely on it. There has been several time, when our baby is crying, before we actually see him moving. This really upsets me."
2,Bad sound reception,"I bought this monitor because I wanted to see and HEAR my baby; and even, turn off the tv and only hear my baby at night, but, as I located the monitor just far away from the camera/microphone, it becomes horrible to hear the baby, it only has static noise on it, and it is very difficult (if not impossible) to hear our baby.....it is impossible to wipe off the static even if you located it near or far from the camera.....it does not have any noise filter that could erase that static noise, so, it is NOT a very good choice if you want to hear your baby.....and if you ever try to talk by phone using a wireless phone unit, you will be surprise of all the noise the baby monitor gets......."
4,GREAT MONITOR AND CHEAPER!,"I can honestly say this is so far the best video monitor out there. I tried the safety 1st monitor which is more expensive and had no luck. I could not get a clear picture. I tried exchanging it for another one and still the had the same problem...to much static! Well I decided to try out this new product and absolutely love it. It has no interference I get a clear picture and best of it all is I don't hear any static. Its very quiet! Another great thing about it, is the the way you turn on and off the video screen while its still on...its like a snooze button. ITS JUST GREAT! I see my baby at all times and any little noise lets me hear and see it. Another good thing is the way the camera comes, you can place it anywhere! I am sure if you get this product you will love it and its so much cheaper."
5,Great Monitor,As a first time mom I can say that this monitor is a MUST have. I was constantly running to where he was because I was worried something might happen. With this monitor I can sit quietly at my desk/couch/etc. and just glance over and see him. I live in a rather large 3 story home and I've had no problems with reception what so ever. I would recommend this monitor to anyone.
3,monitor quit working,"I absolutely LOVED this monitor until after just a few months, our monitor quit working. The sound still works great (I can hear our daughter breathe), but now the monitor just has a line down the center of the screen. Before it quit working, the picture was good and we really liked being able to see our daughter during her naps. The manufacturer responded promptly to my email, but told me it would cost $53 plus shipping for them to fix it!!! I might as well go buy another for that price. Even though I loved this product when it worked, it did not work long enough for me to justify buying a new one."
3,Worked great... until it broke,"I LOVED this monitor, so I was very disappointed when it broke after only 18 months of use. It was well taken care of, so we were very surprised when the picture went out. The sound went out about a week later. When the sound went out, we did smell smoke like one of the other reviewers.It worked so good until it broke, I'm not sure if I should buy it again, or try something new."
5,Great video monitor,"Bought this when our baby daughter refused to sleep in her crib (ever). Needed to see her waking in our bed, so we bought this. It's been wonderful. The picture is fine for a black & white monitor. Audio is fine, too. I have absolutely no problem with our monitor whatsoever. I would definitely recommend this to others. It is also less expensive than the other manufacturers. We've had it for over a year now, and I expect we'll continue to use it even after she's older (to monitor the kids playing in a basement play room when we get that done)."
1,Freaked my wife out...,We received this gift for our shower after friends of ours raved about how great this was. Well I then got it home started to install it had both the camera and the monitor on when I decided to turn the camera off. My wife tells me Honey there is a baby on the monitor. I said yeah right! She said I'm not kidding. When I looked at the monitor there was a baby in his crib sleeping and I could even hear his breathing. This really freaked my wife out. Looks like it was picking up someone elses camera frequency. I packed the camera up and back to Babiesrus it went. Imagine if someone really want to peek into your house. Some people might rave about this but I cannot think of someone invading my privacy like that.
1,Dangerous Product ... BEWARE,"After two months of use, our monitor literally went up in smoke. One night, we woke to a burning smell, turned on the light, and saw smoke coming from our monitor. DO NOT leave this product on unattended ... should be recalled."
3,Nice to know we're not alone.,"We received our monitor as a gift for our second child. We got it a couple of months before she was born, so we used it in my son's room until she came along. It was great to be able to see and hear him alone in his room. We've now had the monitor for about five months, and are having audio problems more often. I came here to see what the other opinions of this product were. And it's nice to know it's not just me. I figured the noise was electrical interference that I had not figured out yet. Well, from the other poor reviews, looks like we only have a couple more months of use.I would put it on my registry again and let someone else pay for it, but would not buy it myself.If anyone has any suggestions as to what the interference could be other than ceiling fan, cordless phone, or second audio monitor, please let me know. Thanks, good luck and I hope this helps."
1,HUGE WASTE OF MONEY,"THIS PRODUCT WAS A TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT FOR US. IT HAS TERRIBLE RECEPTION AND THE PICTURE IS SO UNCLEAR I CAN'T TELL WHAT I AM SEEING. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT MADE BY THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE, WE HAVE A MOVEMENT MONITOR THAT IS JUST AS BAD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,average,Nothing special. I didn't realize this was a book of short stories or I wouldn't have bought it. Maybe I've read to many of his novels and thwey are all statring to sound the same.
1,Read on Google Books before you buy,"Read about this theory supposedly in relationship to stock market investing. Read excerpts on Google Books. It appears to be a collection of management consulting bromides and cliches. Also, the world has changed a lot since its publication date in 2003. Suggest anyone check it out before buying. Definitely not worth the $100 posted price - unless you have corporate expense account."
5,VFP 7 - Best Version of FoxPro Yet,"I've been developing in the beta version of VFP 7 for the past 6 months, and so far I've had a great experience with it. Even in beta I've found the product to be robust and reliable. In VFP 7 it even easier to develop applications due to it many new features such as intellisense (you start a command, and the program provides the possible options to finish it). I'm to the point where I feel a bit too contrained when I have to go back and use VFP 6.0 for code maintenance purposes. I know I can't wait for the final release of version 7 -- I'll be first in line to purchase."
1,Waste of time,"I bought this book two weeks before the BioGRE in order to bone up on anything that may have slipped my mind since freshmen bio class. The review section in the beginning of the book was ok, though it went into insane amounts of detail. I took the ""practice test"" in the back, which was so different from the actual test I wanted to scream. The actual test is far more clearly written, thought out, and fair.This book also gives a section to explain why you got that one question wrong about how bacteria reproduce. Sounds great, right? Wrong. Sometimes the explanations say things like ""Answers B, C, and E can be eliminated because they are wrong. Answer D is the correct choice. Answer A is also a good choice."" How helpful!Save your money and read another review book or your freshmen bio text."
5,a classic,I loved this record. it is one of my all time favorites. there is such emotion in every track. this is a must buy!
1,Pro Racer Wheel stupid idea,The Gamester Pro Racer Wheel is poorly designed. To turn left one must pull the left side of the wheel counterclockwise so the black bottom of the left side touches the black bottom of the right side of the wheel. To turn right one pushes the left side of the wheel clockwise. When using the Pro Racer Wheel my hands and wrists quickly became sore. The directional pad in the middle of the wheel is cheap. Stay away! Either revert back to your Microsoft controller or buy a real steering wheel.
5,SPICE GIRLS RULE!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK WAS TIGHT!!!!,THIS BOOK HAD ALL THE 411 ON THE SPICES THAT I HADN'T ALREADY KNOWN. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.I EVEN FINISHED IT IN 2 OR 3 DAYS.I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK THAT I READ THAT FAST!!!!! IT GAVE ALOT OF INFO ON EACH OF THE SPICES AND IT SAID ALOT ABOUT HOW THEY STARTED.BYE!!!!!!
5,It was good and gave me quite a few facts!!!,I really liked this books. I've bought other books about the Spice Girls and this was one of the best. I would definately recommend this book to any Spice Girl fan out there. Spice Girls Rock!!!!!
4,Great Book,I LOVED this book it had so many facts on not just the Spice Girls as a group but each girl on her own. I liked it but it was still unoffical.
3,close ...but broken winged,"The last the third period of Everly Bros. First, Cadence early classic Second, Warner Bros hits, Third, Mercury 80's comebackSOME HEARTS suffers from some lesser songs Phil and Don still ring true voices but the material does not add up to the previous last 2 albums. It is sorry to be said that this is the last album/CD of new material, maybe forever.Everly Bros. completists will want this CD (no LP issued)"
3,Problems Feeding?,"I almost gave up and brought this calculator back... I could not get it to feed (and the instructions don't help since they are very small).. It prints nicely now that I've been given the secret to feeding the paper:There is a slot under a little black plastic strip in the calculator.. Cut the paper into a "" /-\ "" type of shape (diagonals on the side up to a straight edge) and put this smaller piece into the loading slit. Apply constant pressure to the paper(without bending it) while pressing the FEED button. It seems to work really well.I had to look a while for this info or the calculator may have scored higher"
4,fun toy,The scooter glides well and looks good. The kids like it. It'd be nice if it were just a little bigger - for sitting and kneeling on. But I suppose if I were just a little smaller I wouldn't be saying that. ;)Great toy. Good for gyms/basements.
1,Useless product,"This scooter board does not hold any weight. I am under 130lb, but I can not sit on it and roll with it. It's a waste of money to buy this product."
4,COOL SCOOTER,"I use these things in PE. I really think they are great, except, they pinch fingers (OW) and aren't always THE BEST."
2,They're not black!,"I ordered these straps to go on a boat with a black bimini top. The picture shows straps that are black. What I received were straps that are white! I did not use them, so I don't even know what the quality is like or if they work. Very disappointed. I needed these on short notice and the opportunity to use them was lost."
1,Does not work below -4 degrees Fahrenheit contrary to the label on the face of the product (the image is misleading),"First, the unit that I received didn't look anything like the one depicted in the picture.Second, this unit does not work below -4 degrees Fahrenheit - which is not what the product image indicates (i.e., -58 to +158 degrees Fahrenheit). In other words, you cannot set the Low Temp alarm below -4 degrees Fahrenheit.If this information was clearly satated in the description of the product - I wouldn't have ordered this unit. By all means - very misleading."
3,Lovely...but not life-changing like The Good Earth...,"This is a lovely novel, beautifully written and insightful on romantic love and on duty in the Chinese culture of the early 20th century...but it lacks the ""great"" quality of The Good Earth, which is on my top ten list of all time! I liked the characters here but do not feel attached to them as I finish the book, which is disappointing. A nice read but not one of Mrs. Buck's best. For really super reading with a bit more dimension, try Peony and The Three Daughters of Madame Liang, among others!"
1,Best thing about this movie is the end credits,"On the end credits is an amusing set of out-takes from the filming of this absoultely dire movie.The rest of the movie is not even worth a glimpse. Despite having some decent names involved, the movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I don't want to describe the movie as it is behind me now, but just look at the reviews on imdb.com and you'll soon see they are all in agreement with each other.AVOID this film!"
1,NIGHTMARE!!,"AVOID THIS COMPANY!! My unit arrived broken. Haier customer service was rude & obnoxious. They were completely unapologetic & seemed to go out of their way to be UNHELPFUL. When I finally bullied them into action, they wanted a full week to send out a service man who may or may not have been able to fix it. I spoke to both customer service and corporate, both were extremely rude and entirely useless. What's more, neither one had the decency to so much as apologize. NEVER AGAIN.This was every internet buyer's nightmare!"
2,Remember......,"This book was one of the worst in the series. However it is important to remember not to criticize Clancy. He doesn't even write the books. This one is in fact written by Steve Perry. It is just ""Tom Clancy's Net Force"" because Clancy is the one who first created the series."
5,Great Game For Simpsons Lovers,"I LOVE the Simpsons and therefore I LOVE this game. It's really fun for both adults and children. I've been playing Clue for years, and it was an interesting change playing Simpsons Clue. I'd recommend this game to anyone, especially those familiar with the cartoon."
4,This has to be fun!,"I got this for my son for Christmas (he's a big Simpson's fan). I always enjoyed playing Clue when I was young so I think this would be fun for us to play together. The fact that they use places and ""weapons"" that the Simpson's would most likely use (radioactive donut, anyone).I can't wait to play this game."
2,"great concept, hard time getting through it",I think I am too analytical to appreciate this book. It seems as though no-one proof-read it before publishing. The authors present the information more like a train of thought than an organized view of emotional development.
4,"Low budget, high style","Ulmer's ambitious, cockeyed update of ""Hamlet"" is one of his best Poverty Row films. Cheesy sets, half-baked scripts, and overwrought acting are to be expected from these ultra low-budget productions, and they're all in abundance here. But because Ulmer brought his screwy artistry to even the seamiest Z-grade projects, this film is shot through with a grimy gutter poetry. _Strange Illusion_ isn't a cult masterpiece like _Detour_, but it's still worth seeing.For my money, this film's treatment of psychoanalysis, exploitative though it may be, is still superior to Hitchcock's _Spellbound_."
5,strange illusion,"I am a great fan of Warren William, who played Perry Mason in old movie series. This is why I purchased this movie. Anything he does can have an undercurrent of adult humor. Easy to deal w/ seller. No problems. Delivery on time. Thanks"
3,It's ok .. trying to get used to Mac is hard though. :/,"Got my package real fast was great. The program itself is fine, I am just trying to get used to using a Mac instead of the PC."
5,It's still the Gold Standard,"I've been using Microsoft Office since Office 98 and have never had a problem with any of the programs. Of course it has many more features than most people will ever use, but I constantly find new ways to streamline projects. I use it mostly in a business environment and don't know of any other program (suite) that would work as well as this does. I suppose for most ""home"" users, Apples Pages, Sheets, and Keynote would work fine, but for real heavy lifting you (still) pretty much need Office."
4,"Crystal Clear Blu Ray, But this version is cut","Great movie but the version I saw before I bought this had a few additional/altered scenes that are not included as special features here. Kind of disappointing as they were much funnier than what the filmmakers included here. The pimp scene dialogue is much better on the torrent version I saw for instance. I'd say buy this for picture quality if youre crazy about formats, download for a funnier version that flows a little better."
4,black dynamite,it was hilarious... looking at this old timey movie brought back alot of memories and the styles they wore...it was crazy...but overall it was fun to watch..me and my kids had a blast...they couldn't stop laughing at the slang and corniness...it was nice to share with my kids who are grown now and made them realize that some of the fads they have right now will be what their kids will be laughing at someday...I will be searching for more of such so we can have this experience again
4,Entertaining,"I got caught up in the hype, and as a result, the film didn't meet my hopelessly high expectations I had for it. That said, the movie was very funny, and a movie that has replay value: there are many subtleties that might be missed the first time through.4 stars might be higher than I feel it should be right now, but I am thinking the movie might grow on me.By the way - not a movie for kids. But the rating should have told you that already."
1,An insult to all of the great blaxploitation flicks,I grew up in that 70's era of the blaxploitation movies and that did not scratch the surface for me. Sure the clothes the hairstyles and the sets was a good description but the great blaxploitation heroes and heroines fought for serious issues that was going on in the black community and I am very sure it had nothing to do with a presidential conspiracy to shrink the black males genitals either.
5,"Funniest spoof since ""Airplane""","This film is hilarious. It hits all the tropes of blacksploitation films. Go ahead a buy it, because if you watch it once you'll want to own it."
2,Boring,"I love humorous horror. I love Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and Squee, so I thought I would try out this series of twisted dark humor. It was soooooo boring. Save your money."
2,Disappointed,"I own the entire Carmen Electra series and was excited to hear a new DVD was coming out. I pre-ordered it even. I think this is the worst out of the series, followed by her other new release, Vegas strip. It starts out with a warm up, that doesn't have her speaking during it. They put her voice in, and it makes the workout feel very impersonal. After the warm up they change it and she speaks while demonstrating the moves. I don't feel like the viewer learns anything new with these two releases, and is left challenge-less."
1,"Arent we supposed to be watching your hips, not your face?","I own 2 of Carmen Elecra's aerobic workout videos, including Vegas Strip. In the Bedroom is a flop. There is no workout, and most of the time the camera man is zooming in on her face. Um, excuse me, but isnt the more important action happening below the waistline?I love the Vegas Strip workout, you can actually feel where its working, and see how she is doing the moves. But dont waste your money on this one."
5,Excellent help for ACOAs,This book was very helpful in helping recover as a ACOA. It was Insightful as to what I can do to change behaviors that I have learned becuase i lived with Alcoholic parents.
4,helpful book,"i like the book, i didn't give it 5 because well its a self help book. i recommend it to anyone who is shy"
2,I don't find this book useful at all,"This book is for novices who has very little knowledge on IPv4 and now trying to know something about IPv6. My sincere advice to any serious reader on IPv6 would be, never go for this book. It gives no information but stories about how internet evolved and kind of stuff. And anybody who is working deeply on IPv4 would know that. And this book gives fifty to sixty pages of printed RFCs, may be to make the book bulky."
3,Missing 3rd Set !,"I would rate this as the weakest of the Dead videos that are currently released. The song selection is OK, nothing special. Performance is acceptable. The biggest problem is the exclusion of the 3rd set, where the Neville Brothers joined for a few songs. Only the ""Knockin"" encore is included."
4,"Cute, classically corny comedy","Great movie! Tony Randall is adorable in one of his few leading characters, and Debbie Reynolds is a little too sappy, but it's a great movie!"
3,Cute!,Yes this is a cute movie and was amusing and as a fan of Debbie Reynolds and Tony Randall it was worth watching even though the character who Debbie Reynolds played was kind of annoying at times I still enjoyed the movie.
4,"Debbie Reynolds, Tony Randall how can you go wrong?","This is a cute, funny little movie that is just fun to watch. If you liked ""The Thrill Of It All"", ""Houseboat"", ""Move Over Darling"", or ""Father Goose"" then you will probably like this."
3,Kind of nice. Ok. I couldn't get into the characters that much.,"It was about a school teacher, Quinn, her family and friends. It was about relationships that weren't going well, some were breaking up. Some got back together later. Nothing really excited me. Even after seeing her end up with Nick, which was a happy ending, I felt as if too many details were missing. The story wasn't as fulfilling as I would have liked. Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting current day, small town USA. Copyright: 1999. Genre: contemporary romance."
4,Funny but serious.,"I enjoyed this story. It is fast paced and more than a little crazy. It is based on a woman who has decided that she wants to make a few small changes in her life. Basically she wants to keep the stray dog that someone has brought her. Her live in boyfriend (who is just a bit controlling) doesn't want it and even takes it to the pound. This sets off a huge chain of events that ends up with her being stalked and at the same time finally finding her true sole mate. Along the way she buys a house, helps her friend try and put some spark back in her marriage, and it seems the entire town catches the bug that she has and things are changing all over the place. There is quite a lot about stalking in this story that makes you take notice!"
4,Wow!,"Crusie's characters literally pop out of the page at you. I found myself wanting to smack Bill, the ex-boyfriend, gossip with Darla, and help Quinn move, just from reading. The book's exploration of what one small decision can do to affect the lives of practically an entire town is interesting and thorough, and Crusie throws in enough quirky characters and plot loops to keep one interested the entire way through. But like any good romance, everything works out in the end - just not the way you'd quite expect a typical romance novel to work out, though. A caveat - if stalker-esque behaviour freaks you out, you might want to avoid this book."
5,Waiting for the Movie,I just returned from vacation where I devoured this book! I loved it. It made me laugh out loud several times which caused my 3 year old to ask what was so funny! Now I am waiting for the movie. I can just see Sandra Bullock as Quinn but I haven't yet made my decision for Nick - maybe Nic Cage. Nic fits Nick's description - wiry and not too good looking. I have also read Tell Me Lies (& loved it) and am anxious to read Welcome to Temptation. I am almost tempted to buy the hardcover rather than wait several months for the paperback.
4,Riga Review,"A classic Mankell and Kurt Wallander story. The surprise element is taking Kurt out of his familiar Ystad surroundings and taking him over to Riga in Latvia. This is starnge territory for Wallander readers, but made interesting by th plot. Worth reading as always."
5,Dogs of Riga Super,"Just read this older story about Kurt Wallander. Very atmospheric, and the truth of the matter(s) comes only at the end, keeping one's interest plowing ahead. Super story and writing."
2,most disappointing of the series,"This is the weakest of the six books I have read in the series. The translation into English is flat and the language drab. Usually, the element of mystery and suspense is stronger as is the character development of the detective Kurt Wallender and those surrounding his life. Here, the mystery lacks tension and at the end I hardly cared about the resolution. Also, there was little depth in the portrayal of Wallender or his personal circumstances. If you want to read two first rate Wallender mysteries, choose either One Step Behind or Sidetracked [they are quite similar in plot --and both are extraordinary mysteries]."
1,Unengaging,"I tried to give this a chance, because it's set in Sweden, but after the 50-page test, I saw that it was just another boring police novel. (DNF)"
3,least good of the Wallander books,"I've read several Wallander mysteries and I love the character but this book, while I liked it, is at the bottom of my list for favorite Wallander mysteries."
4,Review of The Dogs of Riga by Kurt Wallander,A Very intreaguing story with plenty of excitement and twists and turns in the plot which makes for good reading
3,"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind","Despite the possible interpretation of its title, this is not a great book for beginners like me looking into Zen Buddhism. I don't think jumping into the practice of Zen is the best way to get an overview of what it is about. This book is written under the premise that the reader is already handy with the sometimes difficult concepts. That said, I kind of liked the book as an adjunct to other studies."
5,"Easy read, very inspirational...",I'm about half way into the book and have found many gems of knowledge so far. I would recommend it to anyone who studies the Buddhist philosophy.
3,Zen Mind Beginners Mind,It was used book. It came promptly and was in good shape. It is for a class my son is taking and is a required read.
2,Nice and Glib,"It sounds good, with the fly printed on the page and the condescending rhetoric that passed for wisdom at the SFZC.What Zen masters of this lineage teach nowadays is nothing valuable. They teach you to abandon expectation and embrace mediocrity, unlike the masters of the Mumonkan and Hekiganroku. There are no real masters in the USA for certain, where they all look up and bow down to Shunryu Suzuki, who came out (in THIS book) and admitted he had never had satori, and whose lineage was a matter of ritual and hand-me-down heritage.Or the followers of Trungpa, a drunk who appointed as his successor an HIV-positive predator who knowingly infected his own students with AIDS. You must find your own light on this continent, and be, as the Buddha himself proclaimed: ""a light unto yourself"".Why waste your time when you are told to ""expect nothing""."
1,Never Had Satori,"Shunryu Suzuki never had Satori.He admits this on the FIRST page of this very book.So why should we listen to him?According to D. T. Suzuki, ""Satori is the raison d'tre of Zen, without which Zen is no Zen. Therefore every contrivance, disciplinary and doctrinal, is directed towards satori.""Shunryu Suzuki inherited his Roshi title from his father, without any authentic Dharma transmission.HIS only named Dharma successor, Richard Baker, was a notorious playboy who spent the SF Zen Center money on Porsches and jetsetting.And now the SF Zen Center, run by a bureaucracy of new age politically correct ""talking parking meters"", is a franchise temple, spinning off their chain store temples all over the nation, with their emphasis on ""no enlightenment buddhism"".The San Francisco Zen Center has yet to produce an enlightened Roshi. They are a fraud.And this fox's book continues to trick naive Dharma seekers.No satori, no authority."
1,Impossible to Understand,"This book has to be one of the largest wastes of paper known to mankind. While I am sure this master knows what he is talking about, he sure as hell doesn't know how to impart his knowledge to anyone else.Extremely confusing, and he rambles at times."
5,very good. I've looked back to it many times.,"this isn't some ""how to"" type deal. It's also not a history of zen. It IS zen."
3,Me not Zen Mind,"I really started off with this book to gain more spiritual knowledge about Zen and meditation. Like many of the Zen-less people who want to give it a try I found this book not stimulating enough to continue practice.The book's contents should apply to anyone who is really willing to change their lives in order to Zen more and more. For me, this book was a personal adventure giving a shot at Zen but ending up not practicing it.If you like to try out Zen, pick up this book. When you have a very busy life and want to use Zen to relax, this may not work though. If you like sports maybe you'd prefer to read 'Sacred Hoops' by Phil Jackson first."
5,Good Book,"Shunryu Suzuki was an excellent teacher and has a very impressive Dharma heir living among us today, Jakusho Kwong-roshi. The book is quite thorough and saturated in practice. The title of the book, in essence, almost conveys the entire meaning of the book. The sections on posture are helpful, as are the various other areas the book addresses. The book is probably the most popular in the history of Zen, and I guess rightfully so. I personally have found more kinship to other teachers along the way, but Roshi Suzuki was always at the very least-and excellently insightful teacher. I simply have more of an affinity to, for one reason or another, his succesor Jakusho Kwong-roshi, or Zen Masters Seung Sahn and Taizan Maezumi. Regardless, the book is excellent, so please buy it!Enjoy:)"
2,"If you like bathroom humor, you'll love this one","Marlon Wayans is truly funny, however, for the life of me I don't see why he keeps doing these slapstick/bathroom humor movies. He's in the vein of Will Smith, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, etc. who can do funny ad libs. You know most of what he said wasn't in the script.David Spade was actually pretty good- and annoying in the movie as the smug rich little daddy's kid. But tops goes to Wayan's roommate. There really are his types in college- the extremely experimental yet good hearted dope.It's cool to watch on cable but I can't recommend adding it to your collection- unless you like this sort of thing."
1,not cool,I love this movie and I remember it well.I have always loved Marlon Wayans.I do have to say that alot of the products from gohastings have been good but when I got this copy it was scratched and hopefully it will work.Before I bought it said the condition was very good.Thats a total lie.Watch yourself when buying from this seller.
3,Good looking watch...,"I had the Seiko 5 automatic watch orange in my hands and it feels good and looks great. However, after wearing it for about 20 hours it stopped. Just like that. I started it up again, but then after 30 hours it stopped again. So I sent it back. Currently the reseller is ""demagnitizing"" the watch and monitoring it to see if it still stopping. Seller says they will send me a new one if it does not pass the tests. All in all I feel it is exactly what I wanted, but it has been a bit of a hassle to send the watch back to the seller (insured and return receipt) at my expense. When I add up the total costs I spent 166 dollars so far on this watch."
1,Hard for a kid to put together,"I wouldn't buy this puzzle for anyone under 6. It's difficult to put together. Once done, I glued it together to hang on my 4 year olds wall as I know he will not be able to assemble it on his own for a while. While cute that it's ""spidey"" shaped, it doesn't allow the ""fill in the blank"" concept of other puzzles. Good- but for older kids. Fun- rating 2...come on it's a puzzle...really how much fun could it be. Educational 2- slightly more educational than a standard puzzle. Durable-2-it's cardboard...depends on how cardboard holds up at your house."
4,Great for kids!,"It's not a real quality harmonica. It weighs very little, but since it's geared towards kids, it's perfect. Harmonica sounds pretty good. The included book is slightly helpful in teaching kids how to properly hold it and shows more than a few keys to learn and even some full songs to play. If your child is looking for a musical toy, then I recommend this. If you're trying to raise your child to be the next Bob Dylan or Neil Young, then look elsewhere."
5,One Episode got the whole family hooked on the Action!,A friend staying with us Introduced us to Total Drama Island and within watching the first Episode we were all hooked! It is great fun for tweens and teens alike!My daughter is 8 and she loved it! She watches it over and over again.
5,total drama island,the item was actually for my son. he is a total drama island fanatic and had to have the dvd set. thank you.
5,The show that saved Cartoon Network!,"So CN was dying off very quickly with crappy shows like Squirrel Boy and Camp Lazlo that everyone skipped to watch Spongebob and Zack and Cody. Thankfully, TDI came and saved CN. This show is a riot!!! Everyone I know who has seen this show loves it. So either buy these episodes or watch them on TV. Watch out Spongebob, there is a new contender for best cartoon of the 21st century!!! by the way, OWEN ROCKS!!!!"
4,Pretty Cool,Lots of episodes. It is pretty interesting to watch but isn't as good as i remembered. Buy this if you are a big fan of the show.
2,Good for beginners.,"If you have never used singing bowls before and haven't a clue where to start, this book is for you and can provide useful and clear information to get you going. If you are looking for more detailed information on this instrument's history and uses, without new-agey interpretations, there may be other places to look."
1,BEWARE OF SELLER!!!,"I purchased the Labtech Stereo Headphones (980232-0403), to allow me hands-free phone conversing. I am partially disabled and cannot manage the phone and writing at the same time. I received the product only to find out it was not compatible with my home phone. I had to fill out a survey as to why I was returning said product, of which they were more worried about my ruining the inside packaging...now how can you tell something will or won't work without examing it??? They responded to my survey, then gave me 10 days to return it for a refund. REFUND WHAT A LAUGH! On an over $14+ item, my credit card was refunded #3.43. NEVER AGAIN!!! I went to Staples (which I should have done in the first place.), and purchased a headset which I am very pleased with. BEWARE!!!kathyf262West Bend, WI"
4,Cheap but works great,I use this for gaming and for Skyping and it works great. The fit isn't too tight and the sound quality is great. So far it hasn't broken but I've only been using it a month.
5,Awesome headset.,"I have purchased this headset quite a few months ago and I still use it daily. I haven't seen anything break, as it's quite durable. The sound quality is above excellent, and the microphone, though it can be hard to adjust perfectly for your way of speech, is amazing. The headphones are very comfortable, but can make your ears feel a little sore after long hours of wearing it. Definitely a must have, and for the price, this headset is a definite steal."
5,EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT FILMAKING HERE.,"I can't say enough. Just damn good. Gripping. Voilent. Touching. Truth. Hate. Love. Feeling, lots of feeling. Edward Norton is such an amazing actor! I hope he gets soooo many Grammies in the future! I will see ALL of his films!"
5,Outstanding Performance by Norton,This is one of the best movies of the decade. Edward Norton plays an outstanding role as Derek Vinyard. Dont wait to see this movie!!!!!!
3,quality,"American History X.Is a great movie, great acting and perfect cast.Sadly the picture quality leaves something to be disiredthis film is very grainy.sound is good"
5,.,"This movie is not without its problems, and a few of the criticisms in the negative reviews a ways back are valid. And I do not merit any movie, ever, for its ""social importance"" or whatnot. But the reason I *do* give this film 5 stars is because it is absolutely intoxicating. It is compelling and powerful from start to finish. There are some holes to be poked and some nits to be picked, but the pitch perfect quality of the performances and the unflinching brutality of the content and script more than make up for it. The climax is ... incredibly impacting. If you feel even the slightest inclination to see this film, I highly recommend you follow it through."
4,Powerful,"Before its release a lot of dirty laundry was being voiced about the production of American History X. I had been anticapating this film for quite sometime and was disappointed to hear the director disparaging his own film. After viewing this movie I was conflicted. Without a doubt it is very distrubing and powerful. On the other hand some elements of the movie, technically speaky, are not perfect. I got to thinking does that matter. American History X hit me brutally with its message and I have returned to watch it more then few times. It works and thats what should count.Your New Line DVD was surprisingly devoid of extras. Standard trailers, and then some deleted scenes. Thanks to the aforementioned production squabbles American History X should have had some choice extras. Hopefully it will be revisited. Good movie, sparse extras."
5,Powerful Movie,This is a good and powerful movie. It shows us what the world is actually to life. They take a problem that has existed in the world for years and expanded on it and it moves people with the power behind it all.
3,Evangelical,"Although there are skinheads and racism among certain types of whites in most countries, there is something particularly American about this movie (in spite of its British director) which makes me feel it is inappropriate for a non-American to voice an opinion. Here goes, anyway. I wouldn't call it bad, but I didn't take to it. It seemed preachy and sentimental, with stereotyped characters, and an ultimately shallow plot and story. Towards the end I found it hard to pay attention. Compared with Romper Stomper, a much lower budget Australian movie, with Russell Crowe, which deals with pretty well the same themes, I think it suffers. Romper Stomper packs a much heavier punch, is much less self-consciously arty, yet more artistic, and I have watched it several times. American History X is worthy, worth seeing, but not worth seeing twice."
3,"thoughtfully made, very tragic story","AHX is definitely worth buying. It's a very thoughtful look at racism and how it can destroy a family. Edward Norton's unforgettable performance is reason enough to see this film--I can NOT believe how amazing this actor is (and he's what? 29? 30? Geez!). The supporting cast was good, but they didn't have much to work on (damn script). The screenplay could have been much more developed in terms of the other characters, but sometimes it almost doesn't matter because of Norton. Tony Kaye did a good job on this debut of his, no matter what he says. Not perfectly made, but still very powerful and thoroughly disturbing."
5,Amazing from beginning to end,Chillingly realistic. Insight into the mind of what troubles America today. It isn't pretty. It is graphic and intense which keeps the tone of the move through out this amazing movie. Racisim today is a glossed over problem because it does not directly effect most Americans today. We don't see it so it must not be there. This movie made me think a lot of how I look at and treat other people. That is what we should ask of movies today. Not only do we need mindless entertainmet but we sometimes need to have our eyes opened up and see what really goes on around us. Truely gripping and compelling. The use of black and white flash backs was quite interesting. Well acted and the direction is great. Ed Norton is amazing. A gifted actor. Looking for good things from him in the future. A very well crafted movie. A real must see.
3,good but NOT Great,"The movie fails to tap in to the realism of American nazism. It might as well have been a story about a redeemed young man trying to save his troubled young brother; because that's exactly what it's about. The movie has very little to do with Nazism, let alone racism. It's quite a conventional movie, filled with pseudo-innovative creativity. It lacks realism. It wasn't poorly written, but the writing wasn't all that great either. Edward Norton's character is more like the screenwriter's representative than a real live person. This movie was made more for its message than for its story. It's worth renting but not worth buying."
2,It's been done,"There is nothing new here just the usual Hollywood hype. Grossly exaggerating the threat of neo-Nazi's while ignoring California's minority gangs. More people are killed by gangs in one day than in the last 10 years from the nazi's. If you watch/buy this, just don't think. It aims soley at the emotional."
5,Outstanding!,"I first saw Edward Norton in that terrible movie, Death To Smoochy. I was thinking: Who the heck is the guy in the purple rhino suit? Then I saw him in Red Dragon: Well, he did a good job in Red Dragon but Red Dragon wasn't that good anyway. Then I saw him in American History X, and just let me say this, this is his best role ever. Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, and the entire cast puts on an outstanding performance. It's about a neo-nazi who gets put in prison for killing two black men trying to steal his truck. Later, he begans to see that what he was doing is wrong and once released, tries to keep his younger brother from being a Nazi himself. There are flashback scenes done in black and white. This is good because it actually feels like you're seeing a flashback and there's no flashbacks within a flashback either. The ending was pretty depressing, but that's something you'll have to see for yourself. Highly recommended."
5,American History X GREAT,"This movie is action packed, racist, and knowledgeable. It shows how pointless raceism is and how it shows long term effects of racism and hate crimes. This movie was required to watch for a class in college. I got an A on my report. I highly reccomend this movie."
4,"I enjoyed the movie, but I wasn't interested in the violence","I really enjoyed ""American History X"" because I thought the movie had a really important message to get across. The message dealt with racism and equality. However, the movie was very violent and bloody. This movie made me understand what some people are going through in their everyday life. I can appreciate this movie because it brought racism to a whole new level."
1,A real disappointment,"I have used a Labtec microphone with my laptop for quite some time, and with good success. The microphone is decently built, and the quality of the captured audio is excellent.On the other hand, this Gamimg Set product from Labtec is a real disappointment. The headset speakers are very poor, and the microphone is even worse; even when positioned in front of my mouth, I have to shout to produce a recording with any significant volume, and this is with the 20dB booster enabled.Stay away from this product."
2,Confusing,"This ""book"" is a collection of essays. The essays don't flow together and the context or occassion for the essays are difficult to discern. Unless you are fluent in German, Greek, French, and Latin--you're going to have a difficult time reading this book. Barrett provides no translation for paragraphs in foreign languages. This is a really tough read."
1,not at all satisfied,"I ordered this book as a birthday gift for a friend who is a nursing student. Much to my surprise, ALL if the pages are stuck together, and cannot be unstuck, which renders this book useless. If the seller has a replacement, I would like it replaced ASAP, as my friend needs it for her classes. I have submitted a ticket to Amazon, but have not heard back about a replacement."
1,be careful what you buy,"i purchased the cyberhome dvr player from vct electronics, when i got the unit i could not get it to work, so i had another person try and they couldnt get it to work either, i sent it back,, they sent another one and it wouldnt work either, i sent it back and hopefully will get my money back,would not choose a cyberhome dvr, try something else."
1,"The worst piece of ""excrement ""ever seen","Don't buy ANYTHING from this company, not even for $1!! Nothing works! There is no support, web site does not allow to contact anyone at the company. No phone numbers. Unit stopped working very shortly after I got it. Worse piece of junk I ever bought in my entire life!!"
1,A pitiful attempt from an amazing woman,"While her struggle is apparent her story is difficult to follow and when it is followed it is merely repition: ""I was held hostage in my own kingdom, I was strong, My subjects came to me with gifts... blah blah blah."" I do not reccomend this book except if you are an insomniac, it certainly can put one to sleep"
5,Hawaii's Story - e-book,"Besides the fact that I prefer e-books to hard-covers, Hawaii's Story is an excellent revelation of the history of Hawaii."
3,Table Clamps,I'm sure these work well on some tables but not standard Costco brand ones as they are not large enough. Fast service though!
5,Excellent all around knife,"I dont know what ""Gift Card Recipient' was talking about. I just bought mine, put a fresh edge on it and just cut an onion into paper thin slices, with no tears even. This knife is very well balanced with no feeling of awkwardness like so many of those cheap knives have. Definately a good buy."
1,Does not compare :(,"For Christmas I asked for a Santoku knife and I got two. The first I received and used was this KitchenAid Santoku. While I used it, I questioned whether I was using it right as it seemd so unstable, I felt it was almost dangerous. Surely I was using it wrong, so I researched what I should be using it for. I confirmed that, yes, I should be able to easily chop an onion with it. Huh....this didn't match what I was experiencing. Sooo...I tried my next Santoku, a Furi Coppertail 7""...and it was worlds apart in performance. Slid through the veggies like buttah. NO COMPARISON! Granted the FURI is quite a bit more in cost, but trust me, if I had to buy one or the other...the Furi was worth every cent. I never plan on using the KitchenAID again. What a disappointment."
2,broken santoku,"I've had the large Santoku knife for at least 3 years. It is a wonderful cutting tool, however, this last time after I washed it, the handle became loose, and then, while using it, the blade snapped in half, under the handle! I won't be replacing it w/kitchenAid."
2,Vegas Strip - overrated,"Carmen Electra: Aerobic Striptease - Vegas StripThis was one sorry little dance routine repeated over and over again. Between takes, the editor didn't bother to take out the parts where Carmen was just bouncing weakly, waiting for the music to start."
5,"THIS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE!!! WONDERFUL, FUN, WITH SPIRIT! !!","The movie is one of the best dance movies I've ever seen. It is about a professional dancer ( Vanessa L. Williams) and a sweet and innocent young man(Chayanne) from Cuba. The music is wonderful. The chemistry between Rafael and Ruby lights up the screen. It is a clean movie with very little bad language, a touch of romance. This is one of my favorite movies. I'v watched it at least twice a day for the past month and I haven't got tired of it yet. It makes me want to dance. It makes me laugh and it makes me feel joy. It is a feel good movie for adults and children alike."
5,It was one of the best latin movies ever!!!!,"I rented the movie about a week ago, and it was just amazing. Chayanne and Vanessa were just fantastic. The music and the acting was great. I loved it so much that I watched it about 3 more times. Since I am hispanic, it was even more enjoyable, especially since I love to dance!!!"
3,slow & predictable,"some good dancing/music & an occassional laugh; however, i found the story slow, cliche & predictable. did i miss the scene where the us/cuban governments began allowing hassle free travel for citizens between the us & cuba??? a 2 star film with an extra star for vanessa williams, who is unbelievably gorgeous."
5,romance and love,"It is a nice litle film. On honesty,reality and there is many ways to have a family. Raffele comes from Cuba to the USA. He works as a handiman, who has hidden dance talents. He dances and romances the dance teacher, teaches her to relax and let loose. Alot of sweet romance as he takes her out and about, and excitment as they dance in copetions and win. Wonderfull visuals in the costomes. I showed this to my neice when she was young and she loved it! and she is now 16,and its still her favorite movie, so she got her own copy for christmas."
3,Dance with Me,"Beautiful people, beautiful story, great music, the kind of movie you watch to really relax and ""go to a happy place"". The ball-room dance afficionados will love it. Watch it!"
3,Decent,"This well thought out film had it's highs and lows. I loved the entriguing Latin dances and the predictable, yet satisfying romance. Although the plot was hard to follow in some areas for younger viewers, this vibrant film had a lot of realistic views that could relate to our every day life. It was decent."
4,I've seen it but I didn't buy it!,"Don't know how this is shown as a purchase because I didn't buy it however, I did see! I enjoy some movies where they learn the dance steps and watch as they progress and I do enjoy them. If you think it is easy just try it. I'll see a step like in the movie Cadence with Charlie Sheen and get up and try the step...Did it! Just fun stuff and some of these moves are a challenge."
5,A very entertaining romantic musical with latin dancing.,"This video is one of the rare musical videos produced in the last decade. Without violence and steamy sexual themes, the video is romantic, entertaining and light. For someone tired of extremes of sex, violence and special effects on the screen, this is a very refreshing movie. We highly recommend it for pure relaxationa and enjoyment."
3,"Movie a little slow, dancing entertaining!","Overall this movie was a little slow, the plot was predictable, and it took a little long to get there. The best part of this movie was the dance sequences. The opening scene in Cuba looked completely staged and not authentic at all. The best part of this movie was the dance competition which comes at the end of the movie after you have sat through almost two hours of very drawn out rather boring scenes."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"I haven't heard anything so fresh and so rock n roll for a long time. These guys are gonna be big, but they need your support. Buy it! Best 13 bucks I ever spent."
1,Garbage the worst book ever,It's a stupid book and isnt worth while the read. You cnat understand a word the guy says. And it belongs in the trash.
4,The usual HBO quality,"A very good production, highly recommended enternainment. Igal Naor's impersonation of Saddam is impressive (and sometimes spooky), despite his clear Israeli accent. Same problem with the ""Chemical Ali"" played by Uri Gavriel, but in a more moderate manner. Anyway, I sincerely doubt there will be a more accurate portrait of the deceased Iraqi tyrant. Pity that the legendary sadism of his son Uday was toned down."
2,Biased,"This book was definetely biased and dumbed down. Some of the information was factual and helpful, but I was hoping for a more balanced and serious discussion on the topic. Coming from a scientific backround, I definitely felt like I was being talked down to and lectured at.Also, I didn't see anywhere where it mentions the fact that several vaccines (including chicken pox, and MMR) are produced using aborted fetuses, which is something I came across on the Christian Medical and Dental Association website. This may not be of concern for some audiences, but it certainly was for me, and I think all people should know about this, and the book should mention it if it wants to be considered an informative text for parents."
1,EXCLUSIVE for members o/t International Churches of Christ,"This book is written and published by a religious and will-controlling, abusive mentorship cult called the International Churches of Christ (AKA Boston Movement, Discipling Movement). ALL Christian readers should be warned that this book and others published by DPI (Disciple Publications International) are written exclusively for members of the International Churches of Christ and SHOULD NOT be considered doctrinely sound to that of the Holy Bible."
2,Boredself,"I guess i am the only one who have negative feelings about the album. I too have waited for 7 years and Nakedself isn't the album I had been expecting. Matt Johnsonn is of course a genius, but this album doesn't add anything new to his genius. The lyrics are so simple..what happened to the man who wrote Infected and Mind Bomb? Salt Water, Voidy Numbness don't feel like The The,they just feel like any other industrial rock band.I believe that Mind Bomb was the peak moment of this genius. Apart from other albums, this album can be regarded as pretty good. But if it weren't The The, I wouldn't buy it. I wouldn't even download it for free. I don't know if i am being too rude here, but as a person who have been listening to The The more than 10 years, I can say Nakedself can be forgotten for another 7 years. Don't mention Hanky Panky..i won't say a single thing about it."
1,didn't work for me.,"I bought two, put them along the wall where I'd seen the mouse go. I put in peanut butter and smushed it through the holes. It didn't work, so I moved them a little bit. Then I saw the mouse literally run right past one of them not even interested 2 times in a night (of course then it disappears so I can't get it) but then I even put a cheerio in them. These haven't caught anything yet so I had to get over my fear and get one of those victor snapping traps that are cheap and I hope they work"
2,Not Built To Last,"I bought this as an affordable controller when I first took on Ableton Live. One big reason why I liked it is that I like the feel of a cross-fader, and this one has it. The serious buzz kill came after I'd used it less than 10 times and the cross-fader went out. I usually like M Audio, but they way they built this one stinks. THE CROSS-FADER IS NOT REPLACEABLE!!! Do yourself a favor, save your money and buy a controller with a replaceable cross-fader, or if you use Ableton, look at the Novation Launchpad or the AKAI APC40."
1,The samples are all in Stereo the CD is in MONO?,I can truly understand why the music business is in the sad state that it in. When you have some guy at Concord Music answer the phone and has no idea about an album they put out and why the samples are in Stereo and I get the CD in mono. I asked if it was a mistake or defective and he said to ask AMAZON they would know more then he would. Concord only makes the Cd we don't sell it. Really bright guy!!! So Amazon what's the Reason???????????????????
5,couldn't be more pleased,the package was quite secure and shipped very quickly. my 90-year old grandmother was floored when her blush was no longer available... i couldn't be happier with this purchase.

5,GREAT!,"It is difficult to put into words what is contaned within this book, many who have read it, myself included, find it more of an experince, than just a read. A subject that can often be laborious to comprehend, Muktananda weaves into a colorful, amazing, stimulating and often unbelievably true tale. I found myself mesmerized and willing to set the book down only when I was so saturated with his energy that I would pass out. A deffinate recommend and a great gift to anyone who is on a spiritual path.."
2,early techno meets king arthur's court,"during the days of the vietnam war, emerson, lake and palmer put together an early techno-pop song featuring the then almost novel moog synthesizer. the song's lyrics spin a tail of a knight or some such folk dying for the honor of the king, the court, and many other now abolished politico-social structures. just what the vietnam era generation was looking for."
2,what a pety of sound quality!,"This is one of the best Evans tittles, of course..., but at least this edition, (the first in cd, 1989), needs a deep mastering."
4,A well organized travel guide,"This guide is the most user-friendly London guide I found. It's small enough to be carried around, has great tips on restaurants & shopping, floor plans of major museums, and makes sight seeing a breeze. Not the book to find low-cost hotels, though."
5,Great show,"So glad i was able to catch up on season 3, glad i started watching it and can't wait to watch season 4."
1,collar points frayed,I wore this shirt for one day every other week and after five months the collar points have worn through and the white material underneath is showing through. It's a blue shirt so I can't wear it to work now. Unacceptable in a shirt of this price!
3,Larger than expected,"I ordered a few 14.5 / 32 size shirts, which is their smallest size. Arrow shirts of this size fit me great. These Traveler shirts, however, did not fit me very well at all. The wrists are pleated and look very baggy unless you have stocky arms.I have only worn them each once, so I haven't developed any of the other problems listed here, but I probably won't wear them enough for them to fade or have the collars wear out.If your arms and chest are large enough for it to fit (do other same-size shirts seem too small?), these might be good for you. While ordering, just be aware that they are rather large compared to other shirts."
3,A few more classics,"After discovering Engelbert's perfect note for note vocals i am now in search mode for classic songs he has recorded throughout the years and i'm findng there are many. Even doing cover songs he brings his own unique vocal style to them and often times makes them better. This CD has a few more classics on them- Only Love, Take it to heart, Hearts in the Dark and Falling in Love Again.He never sings bad but after listening to Eng a while you can tell where he really sinks his voice into songs or not and while there are a few other well done songs on this CD making it worth buying, the 4 songs i mentioned are the ones he really got into vocally."
5,Great Sands!,"I purchased multiple grits of this same 3M wet/dry sand paper (32035-800 grit, 32021 - 1000 grit, 32023-1500 grit) for a couple of paint jobs so forgive my copying this same review to all three. I type all week and don't prefer to do it all weekend as well, sorry! Other than the grit, all of the 3M wet/dry sand paper in this ""family"" of their products is just a great tool to use. They all work great wet or dry. Although I did not purposely wet sand, in August where I'm you'll end up with that anyway and it does a great job there as well. There is no degradation during hard use wet or dry and with the type of backing used, you can easily ""slap"" it against something to knock the sanded material out of the paper as you start to lose the sanding function. I highly recommend all of the Imperial Wetordry products by 3M."
4,A Well Written Story,"""Wind Chimes And Promises"" captures your attention from the very beginning and holds you spell bound to the end. It is the story of a close knit southern family who worked hard and tried to do what was right. Even so, they were forced by the Klan to leave Homer, Georgia (Banks County), the only home they had ever known. The book walks you through the day to day challenges the family faced in Georgia as well as those they faced after arriving in Indianapolis. In some instances it must have been difficult for this family to differentiate between Georgia and Indiana. A well written book, suited for readers of all ages."
1,Faulty design,"At first, I was really happy to receive these clips because they have a much stronger magnet than the norm and I wanted them to hold up school papers and memos on the fridge. One clip was broken (plastic was cracked in two) upon arrival, making it unusable as a clip. I was disappointed, but did not return it because it would have been more trouble than it was worth for such a low cost item. By 2 days later, 2 more of the clips had done the same thing with minimal use. Obviously, there is a flaw in the design. Waste of money."
1,Do Not Bother,Besides being short and also extremely basic it is way over priced. I expected at least a two to three hour program for my $60.00. The narrator sounds like she is reading from a script and knows nothing about the subject.
1,"Very flimsy fence, won't take any wind....","I would not buy this fence again, it is VERY flimsy, has no strength at all. So thin and flimsy it tears at the slightest touch. The pic does show it pretty accurately, but who would expect a product advertised as snow fence to be so weak?"
5,Master of cultural studies,"This book is legendary. Max Weber arguably was the first social scientists who devoted his life's work to cross-cultural studies. His pioneering study of ""The protestant ethic..."" combines a broad, almost universal, vision of human desires and ideas with painstaking details of how certain religious movements transformed the economic basis of feudal Europe, and later the United States, into an economy of competition and free enterprise. The drive in early capitalism, Weber shows, was an inherentreligious belief in money as a means of eternal salvation. Trough accumulating more wealth, capitalists were trying to prove for themselves that they were worthy of God's grace and hence were secured an afterlife in Paradise. However, spending money was not an option for these capitalists. It was considered a sin to use capital gains to satisfy carnal and worldly desires ( compare with Enron and Worldcom executives). Wealth was in many ways protected by a fear of God."
1,"Classic work, but avoid this edition!",The Renaissance Classics version is absolutely ridden with typos and other formatting errors. One of the worst reprints I've ever seen.
3,For an amateur sociology student-nothing of a real value...,"I had to read this book as a part of my Social Theory class. I did not find this book interesting (much less relevant to the real life...unlike works of Emile Durkheim, ""Father of Sociology"", that are still powerful and fascinating read). In my opinion, Weber's work is just another example of a 19-century man, sitting around, having ""much ado about nothing"", and afterwords being satisfied with himself and his intellect..."
2,Gotta' be a handyman...,"Purchased from Amazon.com. Delivery was marginal as it took more than 2 weeks to arrive in spite of being advertised as a 2 day shipping. Then, after only 3 months and 7 days use the chair's left arm disconnected from the back. It takes a handyman to keep this chair usable. Buyer beaware."
5,thank you for such a helpful book at such a difficult time!,"Just wanted to say that losing my dog Teddy and having to put him to sleep was probably the most difficult day of my life. I needed something to help me to feel validated and to ease my grief. I was especially happy to see a chapter on euthanasia as we had to put Teddy to sleep. I praise the author for his compassion and providing links to other resourses as well including the support group which occurs almost nightly. Thank you for this wonderful book. Anyone that has lost a pet or has a sick pet will want to read this insightful, compassionate book!"
2,cold,I felt the author was too distant in his discussions and I didn't get what I needed from this book.
5,Very solid,"My beloved Scottie died two weeks ago from lymphoma, and I completely fell apart.I know everyone has their own opinion, but I don't get it when some reviewers say that this book is ""cold"". The last thing I needed to get myself together was to read some touchy-feely book that would only make me cry harder. That's why I thought this book was tops. Not only did it give me a practical understanding of what I was going through, but more importantly, I got to stop crying for a few hours while I read it.Call it ""tough love"" if you want. I wouldn't. But it sure helped me out a lot. I highly recommend it.If you really want to cry, get the book called ""When Only the Love Remains."" I could not get past page one, and that is not what I needed right now."
1,Rip Off!!,HALF seasons for the SAME price as FULL seasons???? Come on!!! I ain't fallin' for the ol' banana in the tailpipe!
2,The Midlife Miracle Diet,"I received the Midlife Miracle Diet, very quickly after ordering it...(Just haven't had the chance to finish reading it yet).I purchased Adele Puhn's 5 Day Miracle Diet, in 1995 and Loved it...So I am hoping to get the same results with this book. :O)""I'm giving it a two star"" at this time, (to be able to submit my review) as I have not completed the book."
5,Marriot!,"This is a must for anyone who wants to understand the american roots of British stadium rock.Great recording.You can find some of the covers on this record by other folks,too."
2,While I agree with the majority of what Sykes writes...,"While I agree with the majority of the viewpoints in Ms. Sykes book, it gets tiresome. About halfway through the book, the soapbox format gets old. It takes little talent to write in such a perscribed format."
3,"Yo, Joe! Autobots, roll out!","Good characterizations of all the people and 'bots we knew and loved from their cartoon shows so long ago mark this volume. The artwork is crisp, although the Transformers are all altered from their familiar forms - only their heads are the same. Great work on Megatron, Cobra Commander, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Optimus, Bumblebee, and many others. I've read that volume two is better than volumes one or three, but it's hard to get your hands on. This is a good start, though, bringing these groups together in a believable and enjoyable way."
1,PUBLISHERS TAKE NOTE AND BUYERS BEWARE,"It's not enough anymore to slap a game together people will not let you get away with games that are as bad as this one is I rented it and returned it its god awfull i cant see why anyone would play this game, and I would bet the positive posts are all fakes, or at least some of them, I mean the power full weapons are heavy but the big boss is super fast so fast you cant dodge him, this game is lame, the concept is lame and the design is cookie cutter and soft around the edges like play mobile toys, no grit or feel to this game at all. if you want a good shooter game look else where cuz this one sucks."
3,couldn't get into it...,"let me first say i made a big mistake. i played rainbow six vegas before i started playing this one, which made this game unplayable since rainbow six is the best console shooter of this generation and everything else pales in comparison. trust me. try RSV if you don't believe me. it'll cure you.but then again this is more of a third person shooter with some other elements then a true FPS, so maybe I am ruined instead by playing Splinter Cell Double Agent before this one. It is the king of 3rd person shooter with some other elements."
4,Great game but a little repetative,"While playing this game I found the experience genuinely enjoyable for the first few hours of play. After about 3/4 through the game the game play gets a little repetitive, but still enjoyable. The plot was written well and the story is entertaining, but the voice acting is a little generic and dull. Overall the game is a nice new look on the action shooter, adding some great flavor to the genre, but the game lacks that classic replay ability that all top games have."
3,to much hype,"i want to like this gsme but with your life always creeping down i just cant enjoy it like i want to,imagine playing halo and the entire time your health gauge slowly drains untill you kill some enemy and get their health and then it begins to drain,no time to adventure around even though on easy you do have a little time you always feel you have to stay on the move constanly or die,for the most part you do,it really gets annoying actually it was annoying the first time i played it.thats to bad their was so much hype,try rainbow six vegas,gears of war,prey or call of duty 3,or FEAR, this is ok for a rent"
4,Nice look,"Wanted something that looked nice on my car, but not too busy. This gives it just the right amount of style without being too much. Does feel a little flimsy though."
3,Great show - Lousy Copy Protection on Disks.,"Loved the show. However i had to try the disks in 3 different dvd players before i could actually watch them all. Would not play in my PC either. Apparently this is due to the lame copy protection they have on the dvds. So here i cant use my Brand new fancy dvd/blueray player to watch these.. i had to drag out the oldest dvd player i had.. And guess what. it would play some of the shows on a disk. but not all or them, or it would have pauses and other problems. So basically I legally bought the shows and cant watch them. Once again copy protection rips off legal users. I will definitively think twice about buying any other of these series."
2,Self indulgent,Too much space and time spent on self indulgent praise. Not enough information on the art or the science. Very little imparting of the knowledge of the art or craft.
4,Essential Aerosmith,"This is always the album that I tell people to get when ever discussing Aerosmith. ""Back in the Saddle"" is probably my favorite tune by them. The album does have a couple filler tracks (Sick as a Dog, Home Tonight) but it is really a great album otherwise. This was back when Aerosmith rocked hard before they completely lost me with all their ""Love in an Elevator"" type tunes. Don't let this one pass you by."
5,a blueprint for what music is all about,This is one of those recordings that changed the rock world as we know it. I remember when I was a kid listening to FM radio and I was learning what music was all about. This may be one of Aerosmith's finest recordings. I know they were wrote off as Stones wanna be's. But they are far from the Stones. Rock's shows the absolute high point in creativity and how out of hand the band was at this time. This could be one of the best recordings period in the last 30 years of music.
4,RATS IN THE CELLAR!!,"Rats in the Cellar is a wonderful song. It has so much energy, yet it keeps the funky swagger that Aerosmith relies on to sell their songs. The rest of the album is just OK, but Rats in the Cellar makes it worth it. Sick As A Dog, Nobody's Fault, Last Child... they're all OK, and they do kind of grow on you, but Rats in the Cellar is not only the best song on the CD, it's Aerosmith's best song ever. (Not that it has much competition besides the ""Toys in the Attic"")"
2,One of best pop albums.,"Yeah this is unpretentious fashionable rock. The tracks on this album are all played cohesively, yet there are flourishing riffs in just the rights places. Very professional."
5,Laws of Life a life changing experience!,No matter where your walk in life is the principles discussed here will give focus to what is truly important to the rest of your walk. Focus focus focus. If you have loved ones searching get them the book!
4,Flat out rock,"From the start of this disc to the end, it is flat out rock! Straight forward with no holds barred. Do yourself a favor, buy this disc!"
4,Jr and Sr sing Hank Williams Sr,"This is a pretty decent album, but they are not ""their"" greatest. They are some of the best known songs of Hank Williams Sr.The first six tracks are recordings of Hank Williams Jr, from his first two albums, SINGS THE SONGS OF HANK WILLIAMS and YOUR CHEATIN' HEART, the soundtrack to the movie about Hank Williams Sr, starring George Hamilton. Both albums were released in 1964 when Hank Jr was 15 years old.Tracks seven through twelve are sung by Hank Williams Sr, beginning with his original recording of ""There's A Tear In My Beer"".Hank Jr's early albums are hard to find, so this is a good disc, if you want some of those recordings."
4,Take me back in time,"To any of you who have fallen under the spell of Jack Vettriano's beautiful work, this book is a must have! I started buying Jack's prints about 5 years ago for my wife and recently found that a work colleague is a collector too. I ordered two of these books, one for my wife and one for the co-worker, so that we could explore the full range of Jack's talent. It was a revelation to all of us to see how varied his subjects have turned out to be!"
5,A Great Mix of Favorites,"Top Gun is jsut one of those soundtracks that takes you back to the 80's. I even brought it to school with me once and they went wild with it. It's upbeat and romantic. ""Take My Breath Away"" is in fact one of my favorite songs because it justs captures the moment!!"
5,Outstanding,I bought this album and I think its cherry! I suggest it for all. Kenny loggins baby yeah!
5,Cool,Great music! I've seen the movie so much that I know the part of the movie when I hear the songs.
3,All Time Favorite,"""Top Gun"" was one of the best films of the 80's and the soundtrack is even better. When I originally purchased this after the movie came out I wore out my tape. This is one of the greatest with songs by Kenny Loggins, Berlin, Cheap Trick, Loverboy, and Hans Zimmer. With the additions of The Righteous Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis it makes the album that much more complete."
1,"Good popcorn, poorly made especially for cost","Purchased last christmas, used maybe 10 times before it broke. The tabs that heat the base were defective, cuisinart sent a replacement but it cost $20, more than this was worth. Save your money and buy a West Bend for less than half the price."
1,Poor manufacturing standards,"This is a popcorn popper that doesn't pop more than a dozen or so batches before the heating element dies. Yes, a very simple piece of equipment is the major engineering flaw in this very expensive piece of junk. But that's not all--as other reviewers have noted, the heating tray has to be positioned just right in order to even get it ""locked"" onto the heating element in order for the darn thing to work at all. Then, of course, just when you finally think you've figured out how to make the fickle popper pop, the heating element breaks and you throw up your hands in disgust.What's the point of replacing the $65 piece of junk by paying another $10+ in shipping costs just to have the same thing happen again."
4,Popcorn Lover,"Great product ...this is our second one. We just purchased another for our vacation home. Everything goes in the dishwasher, even the heating unit. Uses very little oil, but the popcarn tastes great...not like cardboard."
4,Great popcorn popper,This is a great popper. Cooks all the kernels in just minutes. Easy clean up. Definitely recommend!
1,Messy - frustratingly messy,"This does a fine job of popping popcorn, but the design makes the oil leak all over the counter."
1,Cuisinart Popcorn Maker - avoid like the plague,"I purchased the EasyPop Popcorn Maker CPM-900 Series yesterday. After reading the manual thoroughly, and using fresh popcorn kernels, I turned the unit on with anticipation. Three popcorn kernels popped. I tried it again - zero popcorn kernels popped. I spoke to someone at Cuisinart (customer service.) I was told that I had to return the unit to the retailer (8 hours away by car) or, I could give them my Visa number over the phone, and they would charge me $10, and then I would have to pay for shipping and handling for a new unit, and then pay shipping and handling to return my broken unit to Cuisinart. Customer service.....no....customer neglect or abuse....yes."
2,Had to return two of these due to the same broken part...,"I loved the popcorn but returned two of these because I broke the same part on both within three uses. The broken piece was inside the main body (I could hear it rattling around) and after that it wouldn't heat. The first time I did it, I thought I had just been too rough inserting the cord. The second time - after one or two uses and being very careful - I did the same thing and decided it was junk.Pottery Barn let me return it both times with no hassle at all.Now I use a hard plastic microwave popcorn popper (about $10 at Target) that uses oil and kernels and I am thrilled with it. So easy to clean, cooks great once you figure out the right amount of time for your microwave, etc."
1,Quality is BAD- 2nd replacement needed in 21 months,"Buy a different brand - the quality of workmanship is very cheap.Disappointing for a Cuisinart - If I was the CEO of Cuisinart I would insist this was made better or stop selling it, it is an embarrassment to the Cuisinart name.Purchased in Feb 2010, we make popcorn fairly often. It does work great but the construction is terrible. Within months the popping base broke we called for a replacement and the first one sent was broken, 2nd one was ok but we noticed a crack called and complained about the quality of workmanship and now the base base has broken again. I am now buying a different popper - not sure which one. In the end the popcorn popper lasted about 21 months."
2,Not Cuisinart quality,"Cuisinart really missed with this one. I don't think anyone in their Quality Control ever tried popping corn in it. The corn all jams up at the bottom and eventually lifts the lid off the popper as it pops. There are no vents in the top, so the steam starts to moisten the popped corn as well. I wouldn't use the top as the serving bowl for that reason, plus the narrowness would make it easy to tip.On the plus side, it's incredibly easy to clean - I can just pop the lid and the removable bottom portion into the dishwasher."
1,Cuisinart CPM-900 EasyPop Popocorn Maker,"My husband and I saw this popcorn popper at Sam's Club and decided to get it since our Stir Crazy popper was getting older. A few months later, the tab that locks down the heating surface broke. We did not wash it in the dishwasher or subject it to any kind of abuse. It is just obviously a flimsy product. Not going to bother with contacting customer service. We just pulled our old Stir Crazy out of the closet and began using it again. Glad I kept it. Threw away most of the Cuisinart but am going to user the ""bowl"" part as a planter on the back patio this spring. I definitely would not buy this product again."
1,wish I would have read reviews at Amazon first,"We purchased from Sur La Table on Saturday, used it once, and the second time it would not heat up. It is going back to the store today. Guess I'll wait for Kitchenaid to come out with an air popper. I am disappointed that Cuisinart would put out an inferior product like this and I am even more disappointed in retailers who continue to sell it in their stores. No wonder they were all marked down!"
1,Produces tough & soggy popcorn,"Purchased one of these about 4 years ago through a local retailer. We tried various types of popcorn in the unit to see if we could get a single good batch, and we never did. The corn was not light and fluffy - it was ALWAYS dense, small pieces that were tough and soggy. The moisture from the popping process gets trapped in the popping chamber and then covers the corn once it is popped. I drilled holes in the top of the clear cover to let the moisture out, but that didn't help. We ended up giving the unit to GoodWill. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"
4,Majorly underrated band,"Time in Malta is just one of those bands you keep asking yourself, ""why aren't I seeing more of these guys?"" I'd substitute many mainstream bands for Time in Malta. With their heavy in-your-face guitar, amazingly talented drummer, and equally as talented vocalist, [...]. Alone With the Alone was a major change from thier last album, which had some lengthy tracks that created more of a desire for the track to end than for it to begin. These guys have also really set themselves up for success, finally finding a style that fits their talent. The vocalist can both hermonically scream, and equally pull off softer more dense lyrical points. One minor downfall though is, this drummer does not have enough voice in this album. I'm striving to hear the drums, which needless to say are phenomenal. I'd like to see Time in Malta spread their wings, continue touring with the larger bands they have, to gain publicity and fans, and some how, grab the spotlight they most definitely deserve."
5,excellent,"I am a most devoted fan of his music and was ready for everything,but this masterpiece left me completely stunned. Highly recommended to everyone who strives for tranquility and piece of mind"
2,Very disappointing and frustrating for my 5 year old.,"This toy does not work well and it makes a huge mess. My daughter was so excited to receive it and got very frustrated trying to use it. The sand containers ""leaked"" I think the stopper only worked in 2 out of the 6. Also they do not tell you how or where to get additional supplies. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
2,Nice idea but poor quality...,"I agree with all the reviews that have already been written, about the poor quality and the leaking. I wanted to add that, not only do they not tell you where to get refills, but there is not even enough sand to fill the eight bottles that it comes with! My kids were so disappointed because they had divided them up so they could do two each, but then we discovered there was only enough to fill four bottles. Very disappointing product."
4,Nice blowing session,"This is a very nice blow session, recorded almost 9 months after the extremely popular Somethin' Else. Unlike the earlier album, this one is definitely a Cannonball album in style. Unlike many later albums, this is a blowing session rather than a studio appearance by a live, working band.I'll admit to being lukewarm on Milt Jackson and my judgment of this album is probably affected downward as a result. Milt's playing is nice here, just not anything that sets me on edge.Like a lot of Cannonball albums from this period, there is a healthy mix of ballads (""Serves Me Right""), bebop (""Groovin' High""), interesting originals (""Blues Oriental"" by Milt Jackson) and extremely funky material (""Sounds for Sid""). Not a spectacular achievement but a very good one. Fans of Cannonball's 50s playing will find a lot to enjoy here."
2,"well, maybe two and 1/2 stars...","Ho-hum...another Elephant Six album, rife with Beatles/Beach Boys plagiarism, shoddy production values, bubble-gum naivety, cutesy nonsense lyrics, and total incapability to do anything forward-looking with the many influences at hand.I remember when XTC did something similar with those Dukes Of Stratosphere albums, aping everyone from The Hollies to Brian Wilson, but with such an obvious sense of humor and parody that it was easy to digest. But these guys do seem to have a seriously inflated sense of self-importance, as if this stuff were really ""art"", when in fact it's simply emulating the masters with finger paintings.For the record, some melodies are enjoyable, there's always a nice backbeat (ripped off from the Beatles album of your choice), and the occasional hook here and there. But I'm tired of it all. First it was cute, then it was tolerable, now it's just plain annoying. For completists only."
1,pathetic,"...see, the thing that made the beatles and the beach boys great was their ADVENTUROUS, ORIGINAL, MIND BLOWING MUSIC... the thing that makes this band suck is their lack of originality... and talent... oh, yeah, and soul. can't forget the lack of soul... stick to producing neutral milk, dude, they're the only thing that's good about your collective of elephant poo..."
5,A different perspective,This is a book that is both entertaining to read but it also has the subtle ability to change perceptions I think about a loaded subject. I was aware of recent explorings of the family systems in the often mysterious land of Mormonism. The writer has managed to bring a personal experience into the characters of her story and the complexity of being in and/or from a Mormon community in a modern times.I think it is true that it is impossible to write anything without it being somewhat autobiographical but this author has managed to remove herself enough to let this be a story that is entertaining to read and enlightening. It can't get any better than that for a writer or a reader. Being a writer myself makes me doubly critical and I give this 5 stars. This book was thoughtfully written and well researched.June of the Corn Huskers Ball
4,Get it,"If you like AC/DC, this is a must have. The quality varies, which should be expected given the ""pre-MTV"" timing of many of the clips. Even the the ""MTV"" videos provide little production or theatrics beyond the stage performance that they know best, but you get what you expect, and it is fun to watch the band progress from teens to 40s without losing focus on either subject matter or delivery."
5,awesome 70's meet great 80's,would recommended this to any ac/dc fan. if you like the brian johnson stuff you will definately love the bon scott stuff. bon scott ruled was just tragic couldn't have some of his interviews in it. both singers actually made this band great and would play it over and over again while listening to the cd's i dug out of the stuff that wasn't on the dvd.
1,A(nother) C(ompletely) / D(isappointing) C(ompilation)..,GARBAGE.....A terribly executed dvd release . Old video footage with studio versions poorly dubbed ..... live footage with below standard live sound quality .... and miserable MTV era videos which we've all seen a million times ..... a waste of my $$$$ and time . Just another example of the corporate music industry machine milking everything they can out of archived recordings ... don't be fooled like I was . AVOID this at all costs .
5,Listen to this if you want to learn Swedish - you'll enjoy it...!,"After growing up with Polka's at the family parties, I was under the impression that was the only purely Swedish music available - Triakel is a pleasant discovery for me.I found this record who teaches Swedish how I should begin - she said start with music and listen to the words. This record is outstanding for that - I am memorized.The music is upbeat and well performed - a good mix of old and new adaptations of old. I enjoy listening to this on a regular basis - well worth the price."
2,No instructions,It doesn't give you any kind of instructions on how to do anything. All you get is a cd and that's it. So it is disappointing..It would be nice if they gave you step by step instructions on how to make at least one so you get an idea of what your suppose to do.
1,not great,this product worked no better than the g receiver I had used previously.they claim 4x the coverage of wireless g - it was worse than may g. Yes I did have the trendnet N router. Every house is different - it may or may not work for you
4,"Functional, pretty boxes!","I love these boxes. I have organized my baby's clothing by size, and as he moves from size-to-size I simply pull out the appropriate box and fill his closet with clothes in the correct size! I am also storing his outgrown clothes for our next child. In the future, I anticipate that we will use these to store keepsakes, toys, out-of-season clothes, etc. The only problem? They are just a bit too small."
5,Can't get any better!,"In my 50's, I had forgotten about the musical sounds that made my generation transition from Beatlemania into the soul sounds of the 70's, offering breakthroughs by Michael Jackson and his family, yet still producing the body-pulsating tunes that to this day make me turn the volume up full-blast and sing along with words I could actually understand! This Spinners collection is truly the very best of the Spinners! So happy to have them back in my life!"
1,A very sad book!,This is one really pathetic book.Don't buy it. It will depress you! Who in the Good Lord's name is still using Adobe Premiere to do work of any decent quality. The world had moved on. Adobe had blown it big time with Premiere. Apps like Final Cut Pro have totally put the last nail it Premiere's coffin and it is only a matter of time before Premiere goes to the grave for good.I really feel badly for these poor souls who write such sad books
4,Listener Alert,"Most folks are familiar and aware of the more famous Etta James. But Etta Jones was also a great selling artist in her time. She was more of a pure jazz singer with a silky,fluid voice, with less growl in its timbre than Ms.James. Sadly most folks ignore Etta Jones thinking that it was a mis-spell of Ms. James. So please do yourself an audible favor and take the time to purchase and listen to this Etta!"
5,Maturity,"John has grown since his last ablumn and it shines in this albumn. His sound is more mature, and more meaningful. It's not all about the catchy tones in this cd, which may disappoint some ppl. But if you are more into the meaning of the song and how it relates to you and your life, you'll love Heavier things. John has said that this albumn wasn't made as ""chordy"" as room for squares but it was made with a more lryical emphasis. So if you're lookign for a catchy tone, you're not going to like most of the cd, but if you want music that means something, you'll love the albumn."
5,Brilliant!!,Once again John Mayer has put together an excellent set of sounds and lyrics. A must have for all music fans!!
2,To much alike,"I really didn't like John Mayer's new album. I do like the new song Bigger than my Body, but all his stuff sounds to much alike. He is to much like Dave Matthew's and the whole raspy voice thing gets annoying after a while. Most of the tunes are catchy and the songwritng is good, it just didn't have the variety that would make me want to buy it. If your a John Mayer fan, then it should be right up your alley, but from what my little sister has played of his new album, I just can't get into it."
1,This album sickens me,What a steaming pile of [###]. There are maybe one or two songs that don't totally suck. But I'm not about to list them. I don't want to recall the other terrible 'songs' and go through that living hell again.Zero out of five stars.
2,What a change,"I am a huge John Mayer fan, however, this CD did not cut it for me. Normally, to get the feel of a new project, you listen to it over and over, but I was not impressed with ""Heavier Things"". John's first two project were great!"
1,"great album, but the sound is horrible","sorry folks, this title on dualdisc does not live up to the hype, the cd layer is 16 bit 44khz and the sound cant even match that of the sacd CD layer (hmmm??, no surprise there), and the dvd layer is 16 bit 48 khz and guess what? no difference in sound quality what-so-ever!!, i have by far am above average system consisting of arcam and b&w; so i like to think i know what im talking about. do yourselves a favor and stay away from ALL DUALDISCS BY SONY!!!, enhanced stereo is just a nice way of them saying sacd failed and they will never support dvd audio!!! and a dolby 5.1 mix doesnt hold a candle to even a 24 bit 48 khz dvd audio 5.1 mix, let alone 24/96.sorry sony, i am not buying into your dualdiscs!!!p.s. i returned this disc to the place i purchased it and got a full refund and told the management about sony's obvious bait and switch. and they agreed to post signs pointing out the lack of superior sound on the sony dualdisc titles."
1,*Gagging*,"I find it extremely hilarious that the media hypes this guy up to be some sort of intelligent singer/songwriter who people should take seriously. This music is flat-out sappy, saccharine, safe, middle of the road junk. It's for the suburban, trendy, crowd who don't like to be challenged musically because their brains are incapable of handling it. John Mayer wreaks of Michael Bolton! John Mayer is too feminine. He plays the sensitive type to attract mindless legions of female fans who know jack about real music!! Oh well, while the mainstream crowd keep listening to this sappy pop piffle i'll stick to my Nirvana, Bob Marley, Beatles, The Clash, albums. You know....music that's innovative and creative? Something sorely missing in todays mainstream music culture."
4,Great record...if you understand the meaning,"John Mayer is one of my favorite artists, and I think that this record is a great follow up from his body of work. This CD is more Pop oriented...you can tell he added a polished exterior for the radio stations. This does not hurt his sound...but I do miss the raw edges of his acoustic work. John still has the poetic singer/songwriter angst that his fans know and love. He has not lost touch with his move to the mainstream, however, his older material touches me slightly more."
3,A Better Try,"I enjoy John Mayer because he sounds like Muzak turned up. He is a respected songwriter, with one notable hit ""Your Body Is A Wonderland"" and is a very good guitar player. (Those two things earn Mr. Mayer at least a three) In a time when music is cockeyed with hits from people who don't know how to use their own voices, John Mayer is the exception to the rules. The CD bends between soft, guitar driven songs and mild pop, which takes nods from Eric Clapton to Badly Drawn Boy. And although this CD is quite good, there seems to a potential that can be had and as long as John Mayer keeps making CD's, he can build up a nice portfolio of songs. I Like this CD mostly because it reminds me of James Taylor, Cat Stevens and again, Eric Clapton. As his songs continue, so will the quality of John Mayer's work."
5,Awesome CD,"John Mayer's new album is like a breath of fresh air. His lyrics are much more reflective and mature when compared to ""Room For Squares."" Musically it sounded different than I expected and it threw me off a little bit, but in a good way. This CD grows on you. The more you listen, the more you get hooked. Just throw it in your stereo, lay back, close your eyes...You will get pulled into his songs. Of course, I am speaking to fans of this music genre. I can't believe some people on this page are rating this album 1 star. That's totally ridiculous and without perspective. They have no credibility with me....This is a wonderful album."
4,Better than most,"I just bought Heavier Things a few days ago, and it has been in my cd player since. It may not be as good as Room for Squares, but it is definitely better than the average music put out by other artists. Come back to bed was a great song, as were many others. You can't always only compare an artist to his or her past works. Sometimes you need to look at the big picture."
2,Dave Mathews Wanna Be - but he will never be,"John Mayer is a perfect example of the unoriginal artists who plague the music industry today. He brings nothing knew to the industry except corny lyrics and breathy vocals. A couple of his songs are ""catchy"" but quickly becoming annoying tracks that you cringe at the mere thought of hearing on the radio. My advice to John: Try being yourself instead of a poor replica of someone who's musical talent is untouchable! If you want to hear music from a truly amazing artist - get Dave Matthews ""Some Devil"" - now that dude is a GENIUS!"
1,"Oh, what an age we are living in!","This is a complete Dave Mathews ripoff!!!!!!!!!! He can't sing, but whispers. The songwriting is wince-inducing, and he as an annoying mouth. Get Green Day's ""American Idiot"" insted puuuuuuuuuleeeeeeeeeeze."
5,Wow! What an inspirational singer!,"Theres one word that descrbies this cd...wow! yet i can think of many other words that would work such as exceptional, perfect, a touch on the heart and inspirational. John Mayer is one of the most talented artists on the market right now and he isnt trash like Justin Timberlake or Nick Carter. He has real singing talents and he talks about stuff that matters. Kudos to John for producing another great cd!"
4,I love John Mayer,"Whew! I loved &quot;Room for Squares&quot;. His fantastic lyrics are smart, sexy and sweet. I bought &quot;Heavier Things&quot; as soon as it came out. I was not dissapointed. His talent for lyrics is still evident. He has added some more jazz and horns to his sound. It adds a new dimension to his sound and shows his growth as an artist. His songs are truly amazing and thoughtful. I can't wait to hear more from him"
1,Too Many Heavier Things,I recently bought this album. I was thoroughly dissappointed. I agree with an earlier reviewer that there is nothing on here that truly grabs you. The album felt dark and dour. Way too heavy. A reviewer in the NYT recommended Josh Ritter's new album - much less heavy. Quite a bit more inspiring!. I am on my way now to the used record store for trade in. I am way too heavy.
1,John Mayer does death metal,This album is called 'Heavier Things' because its a death metal record. It is a little too heavy. His heaviest song ever was your 'Body Is A Wonderland' though. That definitely should have been on here. They could have at least included a B2K remix of it. That would rock. Maybe he should go touring with B2K. John Mayer stars in the movie 'You Got Served'. B2K should have though. Buy this cd for hardcore heaviness. B2K rocks too dudes!
4,A Different Direction,"This is a much more mature album the Room for Squares... and thats not a bad thing. I like the addition of the horns on some of the tracks... it adds a new dimention to his music.The first listen to the album might not give you everything you are expecting, but give it another spin and it will grow on you."
3,"not as good as to be expected, but right on time","Well,well well. I'm sort of disappointed. somethings missing. maybe john needs to rock a little harder, be a little more passionate.Lyrically, he has definitely evolved. but sonorously, his voice never changes. song by song1. clarity- I would've thought ?uestlove would've delivered a little better. that oooooh. sound is kind of weird, but it is a great song. song- 8/102. bigger than my body- Great anthem. no such thing part 2. very popish, but very john. 10/103. something's missing- great delivery , great lyrics. 9/104. new deep- nice lyrics.introspective. 8/105.come back to bed- alright.all in all, this cd is very interesting. I wish it had more songs, and better guitar from him, but you can't have everything.for any body interested in him, this is ok, but hopefully he can top it next time.i do like the cd booklet."
1,Biggest Waste of Money EVER,"I loved John Mayer's first album, but ""Heavier Things"" is the biggest let down/waste of money ever.Every song sounds like the next. It's the most abrasive dribble I've heard in quite a while.LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT OURSELVES ANOTHER ONE-ALBUM-WONDER.My advice: spend your money on something else."
1,This guy does not rock,"I saw John last night, June 5, 2007, in San Jose. I hadn't heard alot of his material, but did hear that he had alot of talent, so I was looking forward to the show and went with an open mind. I checked around the internet and saw stark differences in how people perceived him; some spoke of Jimi Hendrix, or Stevie Ray Vaughan, and others said he was sugar-coated. So here's the story: this guy does not rock. He is not a blues player. He is what I would call an adult contemporary artist, which to me is one step below soft rock. For example, he did a version of ""I Don't Need No Doctor"". This has been done by many; my favorite is the Humble Pie version. His version was really bad. Not bad like good, but bad like lame. I could have left then, but stuck it out, and it did not improve. He's got some talent with the guitar, but no notion of what to do with it."
3,Not There Yet,"The Problem with john mayer, he doesnt amkes enough research with his music. He has one of the most unique voice in the music bussiness and his skills with a guitar is unlimited. But it seems that when it gets to the studio it just doesnt sound right. But he still makes effort to deliver you truest song and he doesnt fake it buy asking other people to write it or to produced it. So a big cred to johnny for that .... Lets just hope one day he delivers what he is really capable of."
3,Quantity over Quality?,"John Mayer's first studio album, ""Room For Squares"" was a hit, so I assumed his next album would soon become one of my favorites as well. Although it is a good album in general, it isn't a good John Mayer album. I expected more out of my favorite insightfully lyrical artist. The lyrical quality of past songs is reduced to oversynthesized ambitions. I don't know who he's aiming to please--himself or an audience who favors his real music, the music he used to produce. I don't know who made him write these songs, but I say fire his behind and bring back the quality. ""Numb"" appears to be his new ""deep."""
3,The healthy way to getting a good night's sleep.,"No doubt, John Mayer is one of the most talented artists out there, but this CD is just boring. The first track is really good and quite catchy, and Bigger Than By Body is is even better, but after those two the rest of the album goes down hill. The songs are well-written, for sure, it's just boring. I kep listening to it, trying to like it, but after a minute or two of the other tracks, I just keep going back to the first 2 tracks. I'm glad I borrowed it from a friend, because I don't think it's worth buying. Full price anyway."
2,2 of the 6 Balls Were Defective,"I received all six balls ordered; however, upon inflating them, I lost 2 balls. Apparently, these balls had defective air valves. I did email the distributor on 1/19/09, eSportsonlineCS, with no response. Very disappointing...let the buyer beware."
4,It bounces,"If you put air in it, it will bounce!If you don't put air in it, it won't bounce!Kids prefer it with air in it.Great for 5-8 year olds."
2,Shameless,"I give this two stars because ""Are You Gonna Be My Girl?"" is a great song. I first heard it on an internet radio station, and thought ""Oh fun, an Iggy cover!"" No, just an shameless rip-off - although nicely done. Buy the real thing."
1,goodnight mr tom,"I had to read this book in 24 hours 4 school and i was staying up til 2:30 am reading it, but it was dead boring anyway. the first few chapters were just boring, until Will was taken to his mother and was rescued, but, like the beginnning, the end chapters had no action and were so boring"
5,The Captive Queen of Scots,"If you enjoy historical novels, then you should check out this author. I've read her novels for many years."
4,nice,"This cd from late 1991 shows Perry's synthesizer based dub tracks in fine form. The tracks and his voice are in fine form on this cd, and while the overall magic from the Black Ark days are long gone, Perry continues to create his own wonderfully quirky dub stylings that are pleasing to his fans.Nice stuff."
3,Okay!,What can I say that the title does not tell you. It is a simple plot line which is enjoyable because it is simple. Very easy to read and it will not take the reader long to finish the book. There is not a whole lot happening so I do not want to give out any important details since there were not too many. But again it was still fun.
3,OK,This v collar choker is pretty but it doesn't hang like I would like it to. I will not return it. May give it as a gift. Nothing wrong with it....maybe just my neck???
5,FABULOUS!!!,"... really, absolutely FABULOUS!!! Clear instructions break down complex techniques into managable and fun chunks. The only downside is that we are all going to be running around in gorgeous matching scarves and wonderful domino book necklaces -- Tim needs to make another video."
4,Think New,"This is good stuff, particularly for the avid urban scrap booker who is bored with the ""cutsy"" stuff that one finds in most scrapbooks, or in the online stores. A step by step read that brings a lot of new elements and sentiments to the scrap table. I particularly enjoyed the new and different ways to use around the house or old scrap book stuff. An overall good series for those looking for ideas outside the usual comfort zone"
5,Ticket to Heaven,"Since I started doing the Naqshbandi daily Practices my life has changed and I feel and experience differently. Because I am still in such early stages, I can only speak what I have experienced so far.Once I started doing the practice daily and sincerely, I felt the changes in my heart, which cannot be explained. I feel lot cleaner, stronger and my hawas(bad desires) are in fair control. I hope and pray that if I keep doing this that one day My sheikh will bring me to his presence and take me to the presence of Prophet saw and eventually to Allah almighty.To me this book is more important than anything I own. It is my ticket to Heaven inshallah and I pray that it be yours as well. May Allah reward Mawlana Sheikh Hisham Kabannai granting him heights levels and knowledge from his infinite ocean."
4,Pressure Gauge,I did what it was advertised to do. It came with the proper adapters for 1/8 npt or 1/4 npt which was a nice plus. no running to the plumbing supply for parts.
3,OK but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.,It's OK but I wouldnt buy it again. It takes off some of the mascara when you are trying to seperate the lashes. Not impressed.
4,1967 Gig,"In his ""later years"" Chuck Berry never toured with his own band. He would have his people find a local band to learn Chuck songs. Chuck would show up at the auditorium, holler out a song to the band and the key it was played in, and that was it! Even Bruce Springsteen backed Chuck a couple of times before he made it.Steve Miller backed Chuck at the Fillmore a few times while both were playing the venue,, as did a local SF band called the Loading Zone."
4,Track 11 listing wrong,"Since I can find no other place to do it,Track 11 should beWhat Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin' by Stephanie Millsnot a duplicate of track 10"
3,its just ok,"Average camera - the quality is average, the cord it too thick so you cant put it in a stable shape while you want to move it around. I think for the money they could have done a better job. But it is not that bad."
2,mount does not fit all laptops,"guys think twice before u buy this. quality is good. but i had a IBM think pad and the mount does not fit. the mount design is so stupid tat it is not elastic enough. this camera mount fits only on compaq, sony vaio, dell laptops.I have to change my laptop to fit this camera. stupid camera mount"
2,Bad webcam for Vista,I bought this webcam because I got new notebook which had vista and my previous Logitech webcam is not supported by Vista. Having used and very happy with Logitech webcam I got this webcam. The video quality is very bad and as soon as I start webcam the computer gets very slow and I cannot doing anything.
4,Good web cam for the money,If your looking for a decent web cam for under $30 this is one of the best. It works great on a laptop and has a nice carrying case to transport it while on the road. The resolution is great for the price and the microphone is sensitive and can pick up sound great and cancels out background noise fairly well. The face tracking software could be better but I don't use it.
1,Never with a Mac,Although this camera comes with software for Mac OS never works in my iBook. Customer services never answered my request about drivers and have not found any on the web. If you have a Mac never try this camera. I lost 60 bucks.
2,Not for all Laptops,"The quality of the webcam is great, but it is not made for all laptops. I have a Dell Inspiron 1150. My Laptop is too thick to clamp the webcam onto. This was a gift given to me from a friend who is serving our country overseas. I greatly appreciate the gift. I have to try to figure out how to clamp the cam onto my computer inorder to use it, so I can communicate with him. It works great for him and this is why he bought this one for me."
3,Webcam,"A bit smaller & simpler than anticipated, but can't complain for the price paid. The installation CD was missing some files which I fortunately was able to download from the Logitech website.I can't wait to tryout its video capabilities."
2,Very Poor Picture Quality,The picture quality is verrrry blury.I am very disappointed in this product;It was a waste of my time and money
4,really good,"most of features are very good:- the precision lens- the built-in speaker- the light & color boosts- the image qualityhowever, the resolotion is just 325x240"
2,doesn't fit my IBM T-series laptop,"The camera itself is ok. But the spring that clip on the laptop screen is too tight, it hardly gets on my IBM T-40 and T43P (~0.75 in thickness). I have a QuickCAM pro 5000 at work which works much better, although larger in size. make sure you measure your laptop screen thickness before you buy this camera."
1,crashes computer,either I got a defective one or this webcam really sucks.It crashed my computer twice.Never using again
2,WorkED great...,"... at first. I used it mainly for photos and yahoo chat. But lately every time I plug it in, my computer goes to the blue screen and has to do some sort of crash dump thing! It's ridiculous! It's not the first time I've had a problem with a Logitech product, but it will be the last. I've wasted too much money on products that work well the first 6 months and then crap out. Don't waste your money!"
1,Never would work with Vista,"Never could get this to work and the included software entangled itself so badly, it has been difficult to remove. Windows Vista"
4,PASSED!!,"I STARTED WITH NO KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHOLOGY. BUT I STUDIED THIS BOOK ALONE FOR A MONTH AND PASSED WITH A 63 (20-80, 50 PASSING).IT'S WORTH THE MONEY, TIME, AND EFFORT."
1,this book sucks,I used this book for 90% of my studying for this test. Read it from cover to cover several times and even made note cards on a lot of the information that was in the book. Come to find out that time it came to the test there was hardly any information that was in the book on the test. The topics the test covered were completely different from what the book covered. I got more information that helped me on the test from a Google search on Psychology clep and I came a cross a free study guide. At least those topics were on the test. I have to agree with everyone else who did a review if you use the book also use other options. Do not use this book as your main study guide because you will get burned.
2,Not what I expected,Guess I should have read the fine print rather than go off the pic. It was the bag only and I was expecting a kit. Nice bag but now I have to fill it too.
5,Best Toaster Oven I Have Ever Owned,"The Cuisinart TOB-195 is the best toaster oven I have ever owned. It is easy to clean, looks great, toasts evenly and is the perfect size for baking/broiling when I don't want to use my big oven. The only feature I wish it had is an inside light. I highly recommend this product."
2,GREAT OVEN THAT SOMETIMES WORKS NOW,"I've had this over for about 8 months now and have used it very heavily during that time frame. Never found a problem, very user friendly and with the convection feature, I could cook way more than toast. However yesterday, I was cooking an item for about 30 minutes and after about fifteen minutes, I noticed that the fan had stopped and was just buzzing. Motors can overheat and fires have been known to happen from that type of situation. I was able to bang on the side of the fan case and got the fan going again, but I can no longer trust the use of the oven without my being there. It was never maltreated and was always cleaned regular."
2,Caution,"We have had this oven for 4 months now and I must say it does do a good job of toasting anything you want if you watch the oven carefully. I have several warnings for prospective buyers though, everything on this oven gets hot but the handle, the timer is just that a timer when your time is up the oven will not shut off it will keep cooking until you shut it off. The bottom tray cleanout pulls out from the back so you have to take it off the counter to clean it. The middle rack does not pull out when the door is opened like most ovens you will have to get a oven mitt every time to check your food and pull the rack out. We will not be buying this oven again and will be buying another one shortly there are just too many annoyances to this oven."
2,We Expected More Features,"This toaster-oven was a disappointment to us. It needs an oven lamp so you can see what's happening to your food and the crumb tray pulls out from the rear of the unit - a big inconvenience. We received this toaster-oven, looked it over, and sent it back to Amazon the next day. We then bought the Oster 6058 - at nearly half the price - and are very satisfied. It has the features that the Cuisinart lacks. I hope this review helps someone avoid the mistake we made."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,"Shipping is unbelievably FAST!!!!. So far, I only use mine for baking and It was very good. My husband purchased me the cheap kind brand last year and it was terrible. I do a lot of searching and I finally settle to buy this one due to the customer ratings and I was very satisfied. The style and look is classy. I really like the look of it in my kitchen counter.The size is just perfect. It is not as wide as my old one. I save a lot of electricity using this than my large oven. I encourage anyone to give this oven a try. You won't be disappointed."
4,Great Toaster Oven,"Love the toaster oven, however, we're a bit confused on the oven rack positions. The manual states that there are 3 positions for the oven rack and has recipes with examples of where the rack should go, but it's not very clear on when you should use it and in which position. Also - the manual states not to use glass on the broil mode - why? Never heard that one before. One other complaint - the timer only works in hours and minutes, not seconds. I'd like to be able to have seconds on the timer. The manual needs a lot of work - the toaster oven is a great appliance with a lot of features, but the manual doesn't explain fully how to use them."
3,"OK, but lacking in some important features","While I agree with most of the reviews, I do find it lacking in certain areas:1. There is no inside light. This makes seeing how things are cooking very difficult.2. The timer does not turn off the oven when time has completed.3. Control buttons are very difficult to read because they are the same stainless as the panel.4. Some functions require a sequence of buttons to push and requires the manual to do a simple task.5. The convection fan makes a loud humming sound.BUT, it was a bargain at COSTCO."
2,"How do you reheat a slice of refrigerated, not frozen, pizza?","We just got this oven. Toast is fine.How do you know what settigs to use to reheat food that has been refrigerated? Over half our toaster oven use is to reheat left-overs. I just burned the crust of a slice of last night's left over pizza. Not only is there no ""reheat"" button (except the 24 second one for a slice of toast) there are no instructions in the booklet for reheating. I wish the consumer reports people had taken note of all toaster ovens that do not automatically thrust the rack forward. Perhaps toaster oven companies have stock in the company that makes First Aid Cream."
2,repeat offender in the series that promises extended versions,"This time around, we get a fair amount of 7"" versions and edits. Track times:1. Born to be Alive (6:05) (12"" edit)2. rock your baby (6:26)3. you make me feel mighty real (5:29)4. don't leave me this way (5:43)5. macho man (5:14)6. in the bush (3:35) (7"")7. hot shot (3:34) (7"")8. bad girls (4:59) (album version)9. he's the greatest dancer (6:15)10. planet rock (6:24)11. swearin to god (4:04)12. this time baby (5:53)(edit)"
4,Jackie Moore,"Can't believe two others said ""get this for the Jackie Moore song."" That's exactly why it's been in my cart. There are about a dozen songs that transport me back to the dancefloors of the late 70's when I was a disco twink. This is one of them. Absolute perfection!"
1,Ripoff dealer!,"Last year I bought a telescopic rod from this dealer. I got a damaged piece of junk. The rod had cracks an deep gouges from top to bottom. I tried to contact the dealer numerous times with no responses. I didn't get a new rod nor my money back. To top it all off, I tried to use it in the Bahamas which is why I had ordered the rod. The very first cast with a ounce and a half lure caused a 15 inch piece of the rod to break off. What a ripoff!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this one. I bought one 7' and one 9' don't like them.7' broke in base second time I try to pull out 12"" fish."
5,"Buy it, just buy it...Thank me later..","Ok, heres a rub. I have the ORIGINAL VINYL tucked away very carefully. BOTH albums are in PERFECT condition....Pulled both out the other night, looked over the album jackets, yes I have those too, and cranked up the ole B&O; turntable. My Polk Audio LSi-15s screamed out Bad Detective, as I was taken back to the summer of my youth......I loved these guys back then, and I still love them now. Ahead of thier time. Glad to hear the last surviving members, (2), played @ the Filmore the other night. From the press release they received a warm and well deserved welcome back....Buy it, just buy it....You youngsters out there, sick of all the crap out there? Take a tip from a Geezer, heres what it was really like back when the music wasnt dead & lipsynchers were laughed off stage......"
2,Can help many! From Corporate Leaders to Everyday People,"I thought the book would be more geared toward business, but after ready it, I think that it could help people of all walks of life. The honesty and clarity of the conversations between the wizard and the warrior were very moving, and really made me think about how they related to my life. I recommend this book very highly."
1,Too much Will Ferrell trying to be funny,"I bought this CD because of the music- lots of great songs that I rarely hear. Unfortunately, Will Ferrell (in his Ron Burgundy persona) does a lengthy introduction - up to 25 seconds long- for each song. It was ok for the first song, but after that it is simply obnoxious. I can't imagine anyone wanting to listen to him do that schtick more than once. In short, don't buy this unless you need to hear Will Ferrell do the same lame routines again & again."
2,Review of The best disco funk from Josephine Yong,"I rated 2 stars and the price is $2.99. ""LET IT WHIP"" by the Dazz Band, 2nd is "" CELEBRATION"" by Kool and the Gang, 3rd is the ""SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING"" Peaches & Herb. The rest of the songs needs to be replace."
3,Not as good as it used to be ...,"We have an older version of this toy. There are at least 4 different ""specialty"" ramps : water wheel, squiggly ramp, ==O== ramp, whirlpool drop, and perhaps 50 ramps, 20 vertical connectors, and 10 circular / base pieces. From the pictures I see on the Amazon site, this version is a heavily castrated set with less than half the fun of our set (which is circa 1995.) The version we have is called ""Super Marble Run"" and I wish that Amazon would carry this enhanced version - it's well worth the extra $$$."
5,An Introduction to Noncommutative Differential Geometry and,"FOR PHYSICIST, I strongly reccomend this book! There are so many physical examples in this book. Always we physicists hate mathamatical proofs like a torture. But this book concentrates applications to physics. If you want to study Noncommutative Geometry as a physicist, this book should be chosen as the first introduction!"
3,hate this game,A friend suggested me to get it and I'm thankful I go it so cheap. The product itself came fast and it was in great shape. But I hate this game...I really do.
1,"Save your money, it isn't worth a cent and a minute of your time.","Pokemon Ranger has to be one of the shittiest and most pointless editions to the Pokemon franchise ever. All you do is run around the world controlling pokemon by circling them time and time again. This could take you 40 hours to complete with constant stress and a story you will most likely forget in 2 days. The graphics are a piece of garbage, tutorials are a piece of shit. 47 bucks for a game that came out 4 YEARS AGO!!! Bioshock 2 is only 10 dollars and it was made in 2010. Seriously nintendo review your prices!"
4,a break from the normal battles for any pokemon fan,"this is a very good game. it's better than other pokemon games because your not haeming the pokemon the storie line is good but short. the game isn't realy over though intill you capture snorelax (that should be enough of a hint) i just got shadow of almia and cant wait to get it. you use the styls to circle the pokemon so you can befreind them.great game, and worth getting"
4,Great Game!,"This game is really good, from touch screen usage to capture pokemon to each pokemons special abilities. Personally, my favorite part is that you can get a Manaphy and send it to your Pokemon Diamond or Pearl.The storyline is good, and you still have things to do after the game is over. After you do that, then there is nothing to do."
5,The Greatest pokemon game ever.,This is the BEST games ever! I cought a lot of pokemon. Definitely not boring and great value for the price paid. Anyone interested in POKEMON must have this game in their collection! This is a KEEP game.
2,Meh...,"The information contained appears to no longer be updated per the actual research of the author, but rather updated via input from emails submitted by readers. Thus alot of the information is severely outdated or wholly inaccurate. At least the restaraunts I visit regularly turned out to be when I looked them up. One had been closed for several years, but still showed up in the text. This could potentially result in a hundred dollar trip to a vending machine, if the pilot were to go on the information in the book without actually calling ahead. Would be better if the ""Author"" actually researched each locale, and submitted updating information and ratings. Pilots spend alot of time, money, and effort making sure all the information they have regarding a flight is up to date and accurate, and I imagine this would be as dissapointing to more pilots than myself."
4,Excellent Webcam,"This quickcam is very small and easy to carry around. I was surprised at how small it is when I got the package. I have a Toshiba Satellite and it fits really well. However, the outcome of the cam is often a little dark. Make sure your room is extremely bright in order to get clear videos."
3,"So, so",Picture was kind of grainy my old intel webcam -IPCC4PRO- looked better and were talking 5 or 6 years ago.
1,Not advisable to buy...,"This is one of the worst web cam's I bought. You need to have a powerful lighting conditions to view the image, otherwise, you can just view black screen....Not a good idea to spend amount on this.."
3,Logitech Quickcam for NOtebooks,"the webcam is beautifully designed, very fashionable and high tech. However, it can't fit on every laptop because the clip only expands a little bit. I had to return it because I can't put it on my laptop."
2,"Simply put, SUCKS Big Time","I had a cheap webcam (Veo brand) that i purchsed from Walmart. I purchased this this to replace the earlier webcam. It produces so-so quality under good lighting conditions, but under low light its just horrible, my earlier webcam did much better job than this one. The whole point of buying a notebook webcam is to be on the move, but with this one its more like using your laptop like a desktop just to get good lighting conditions for this webcam."
4,Not a bad bargain for the price!,"This is compact, portable, fits well on notebooks. Picture quality is good during day, ok in night!"
3,Cam in Japanese,"Works fine although the instructions are in japanese, thats the reaason for the rate. Good delivery time good condition."
4,Must Have,"This book is a must have for the practicing magician, no matter on how you feel about Crowley. His bits on gematria are great, as well as the tables of correspondences. If at all studying the Q.B.L this is the book to get.L.V.X"
2,Disco nights steps into house--and gives TOO many EDITS,"this is probably the most sinful of this series that promises extended play club versions but rarely follows through. Here's the track times:1. Everybody Everybody (4:10) (7"" version)2. Back to Life (3:51) (7"")3. Finally (6:26) (edit of 12"")4. The Power (5:43) (album verion, not hit version)5. Pump Up The Jam (3:38) (7"")6. Touch Me (5:59) (edit of 12"" version)7. gypsy woman (3:51) (7"")8. Nu Nu (5:05)9. French Kiss (5:18) (edit)10. My Love is Guaranteed (4:48) (great song from that era)11. Ain't Nothin Goin on But THe Rent (6:01)12. All And All (6:06)"
4,I Loved So'Often by C'Note,"So' Often is beautiful. The lyrics and style of the song really touched me. I purchased the soundtrack just for that reason. I heard the song at the producers website and I was taken by it. I heard they are coming back with another album in 2005. I will definitely buy it and support them again. I can't wait to hear the songs in their new album. I have missed C'note since they've been gone and I'm happy to hear they are coming back. I'm in New York but I found this out from my friend Lucille in Florida and reconfirmed when I saw the information on the producers site that wrote & produced So'Often. I found it on this site www.gw1productions.com... C'note's site is www.cnoteonline.com.. C'note, I Adore You Guys!!!!!!!!!"
1,I 'almost' made a mistake...,"Okay people, this is what happened...Today I was channel surfing when I ran across a movie that was going off. The closing music was kinda funky so I continued reading the credits to see what song was playing.I decided to come to CDNOW to check out some samples and read reviews.THANK GOD I DID!!!!!!!!Not a single good review. To add insult to injury, all of the snippets sound like songs that didn't make the artists' original CD.If this isn't bad enough, the song at the end of the movie is not even on the CD. I don't how the rest of you feel but when I hear some pretty decent closing music, I at least expect to see it on the soundtrack. That 'one' song probably would have made me think twice about buying it.Too bad I can't hear the rest of the snippets. They might be better.P e a c eThe Shadowman"
4,dIDN'T know what to expect,"Well.I thought the movie was better than expected. I thought it was going to be plotless like some reviewers said, or really really good. Frist of all it is not plotless, it does have definite meaning although it goes off to a slow start. I mean you kind of realize how messed up this family is at the first sight, you know something is not right, and at the end you really see, and realize that you know people are living just like this in America, maybe not a mirror image but pretty damn similar. So, give it a chance, it's not like it's a 3-hour long movie, watch it and decide for yourself!"
4,strange,it was ok....but it is worth watching to see the sick disturbingending..........u won't be able to forget that.....
3,Trippy as all hell!,"I like to think that I am a very open minded person and like to spread my wings and watch all sorts of movie's. Indie, art house, silent, foreign, old school hollywood, it doesn't matter. As matter of fact I'm usually not a big fan of alot of films coming out these days. I'm also not one of those people who fall under the ""I don't get it crowd"" either. But after watching this movie I've got to say WTF! Maybe if I was high I might have understood it better but my day job prevents me from that luxury. Don't get me wrong I actually watched it all the way through without pause(many films I've paused for break or completely stopped watching because they sucked)which means it held me with some interest. Let's just say it was unique, albino rappers, blind bowling/iceskating, trash can wrestling, incest(let me know if I'm wrong on that one), a crossdressing wrestler and last but not least dead bay kidnapping. Weird, weird, weird."
2,It's hard to rate this movie - but . . .,"I'm usually attracted to off-the-wall flicks - and this one is off the wall. . . However . . . 1) the film is grainy, which only got on my nerves; 2) the father was great, as was the Julien, the schizophrenic. But not much of a story line - simply showing the life of a schizo. 3) it didn't really go anywhere - this is life, mental illness is all around - it's just whether you notice it or not. I think this is way overrated for what it is - and while it had a decent cast, the characters lacked greatly."
5,Julien was awesome!,"I saw Gummo and Kids and I loved those films. When I saw Julien Donkey-Boy, I was actually surprised. I thought I may not like it because it centers around a mental guy, but I wound up realizing that people with mental problems aren't scary or bad. They are normal people with so much love to offer. When I watched Harmony talking on the film extras and he said the movie was filmed in a house he grew up in and it was really about his uncle, I felt even more like a jaggoff for ever judging Julien. Great film! Everyone should see it!"
3,GREAT book POOR conditon,"I love this book and the message in it, but the book was all dented in when we received it....."
3,shopgirl,As for looks it's adorable. I expected it a bit larger then it's size. I use it for my teapot collection display. It's unique shape and cast iron look scores points with me.
4,Goofy but cute,"My son is 4 months old & enjoys this toy. I like that I can use it while he lays on the ground or it's the perfect height to use with his Fisher Price Rainforest Bouncer. He loves to watch the sunshine. When you push the sun it plays 8 continuous songs (including ""You are my sunshine""). I don't like the woman who sings off-key every time we turn this toy on. I'm glad we got this toy on sale because I don't think it's worth the $22 price tag."
5,Interesting spread of stars awarded by reviewers,"In looking at the reviews posted so far (8), I notice that 4 have given Season2 Part 2 a 5-star rating, the other 4 have given it 1-star. And the distinction is clear: all those who think the $35 for 1/2 season is too pricey give it 1; those who think it is worth it, give it 5. But I guessing all would agree that this is one of the best Western series of all time. This was a great series, Season 2 contains some of the very best episodes of the 8 seasons,and fans of Clint Eastwood will enjoy watching him in the early stages of his acting career, growing in his role as Rowdy Yates. If you want to see wonderful TV Western stories, for about $2.20 per episode, this is a perfect choice. If you dont want to pay that much, wait and hope the price comes down. But it could be long wait."
2,"Too expensive for assembly, noise","I don't understand why this fan is more than $100 more thanWestinghouse Winchester Four-Light 52-Inch Five-Blade Ceiling Fan, Brushed Nickel with Frosted White Alabaster Globes #72056. The Mimosa offers the typical hold your arms above your head for an hour and fool with wires, downrods, light fixtures, screws and fan blades. When I was done, I got a fan with a quiet but distinct electrical hum. The Winchester was at least three times as easy to install (less fooling with wires, no fooling with lighting and snapping instead of bolting the blades in) and does not have an electrical hum. The Mimosa is a pretty fan, but I have no idea why it is more expensive than the Winchester."
4,Great product & value. Installation was easy.,For what I paid I consider this to be a great buy especially with the remote unit which I ended up not using! I decided to keep mine wired to the switches. If you don't have a fan wall switch then the remote unit is perfect for you. That alone sells at some place more than $40.Installation was easy. Of course considering you already have a ceiling box for it.The only bad thing about this is the lighting which is too weak. It takes three tiny bulbs more suitable for a nightlight.
5,John Berendt's Mother wrote this.,"Only want to comment that Carol Deschere is the Mother of John Berendt, he of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Berendt says this novel parallels his life growing up in Syracuse New York. And he Mother never wrote another book. The novel sold about 2000 copies."
3,I lost this one..,This was my favorite work out tool!!! I lost it and need to buy an other one. Seriously I can't wait to get an other one. I won't buy a different one. I will only will buy this one again. (Amazon has a silly rule on reviews they don't allow duplicate words words words words words words words words words words yeah!)
5,Great waterbottle cage.,"This water bottle cage is very lightweight and durable. The plastic backing is very strong and the metal cage ensures your bottle won't slide out. In addition, the cage is adjustable to ensure a good fit for any size water bottle.Overall a very good value, highly recommended if you're looking for a solid water bottle cage."
1,bottle holder,"for me it was a very useless thing;( it wasn't a spot on my bike where i could put this holder, so i didn't use it even once;("
4,Great learning toy!,"We bought this for my son's 4th birthday....he absolutely loves it! He learned the Pledge of Allegiance and most of the words to ""America, the Beautiful"" in a couple of days! My 17 month old also loves listening to it!Really worth the $$!!!"
1,Don't Buy,"I purchased this product from Best Buy and had to return it twice for a replacement. I finally returned to the store a third time due to ongoing problems and even the ""Geek Squad"" could not get the unit to load files properly from a flash drive. I even took another unit from the store floor display and after nearly an hour of fiddling by the Best Buy staff, they still could not get the floor unit to load pictures properly. I finally exchanged the Westinghouse for a Kodak replacement and had no problems at all with the Kodak unit. This is an extremely frustrating interface for all but experienced computer users. I would highly recommend staying away from any Westinghouse photo frame products."
2,Frame died after 9 months!,"This frame looks nice and the picture quality is good, but only if viewed head-on. Off angle viewing is terrible. The worst is that the frame died after about nine months of continuous use in a well ventilated location. It shows a solid white screen, no menu access, and will not read SD of CF cards as a test to see if it would resume operation. Look for a better picture frame elsewhere."
2,warranty,did not buy the westinghouse 14.1 digital photo frame because the warranty is only 6 months---westinghouse is telling you their product well not last a year without a problem--
3,So So Coco for Coco,"In the vastness of pop music, consumers are often badgered with repetition and homogeny. Coco Lee's turn at pop, particularly dance pop fails at it's attempt to differeniate itself for the same reasons many other acts do. That is, it's formulic and unimaginative. Essentially, her vocal talents, in of itself, are above average, even if juxtaposed to her American contemporaries. However, the extent of her involvement in writing, arrangment, vocal direction and production may have an effect on the overall quality and aesthetic. It's an interesting attempt to fuse several genres, as the trend seems to go these days. Although the dance remix is infectious, her somewhat whiny vocal gymnastics deter from the overall grove. Still danceable however."
3,You won't want it to end,"This is one of the best ""can't put down"" books I've encountered in all myyears of reading. The author puts on paper the bad luck, the sad and theterrifing details of his months and months on the highway in such graphicdetail, you feel like your butt is getting sore just from riding along.This is a true story and you don't find out what he is running from untilthe very end of the book. The trilogy gets more and more interesting untilyou finally reach another ""Thursday"". You'll understand when you read it.Great writer. Almost anybody can go through what Jack Vink has, but no oneelse would survive and live through it, let alone write a best seller aboutit. Get it. You'll be the pride of your reading friends. I am a radiotalk show host and after reading this great autobiography I had him on myshow several times. This is truly one remarkable man, and a story that youshall always remember. If you have loved and lost then this is the book foryou!>From: Dick DiAndrea"
3,repetitif,Albert griffith est un incontournable du reggae. Malheureusement cet album est à mon avis trop commercial (drum machine+ bass éelctro pop). Un live avec son band (the gladiators) serait mieux apprécié.
2,You've got to be kidding!!!!,"I bought this book based on the reviews and I found it to be a joke. The exercises are totally vague(Ex-author tell you to go in and play around with groups and GPO's)I mean go-in and play around with something that you've NEVER used!!!! This is one complaint I've had and the CD is AWFUL-If you can hear him performing the exercises. I went with Microsoft on this one, I looked at SYBEX(Almost as bad as this one) and found Microsoft's Text to make sense and the exercises are good. My recommendation from a guy who bought this book-If you want to use it to pass the exam-Forget it-If you want to use it for some household feature(like standing on it) then go for it"
2,Go back now,"When you get it, you will not be dissapointed if your a starter, but after a couple backyard shootings, it may stop shooting. It sometimes doesnt even shoot before that happends also. Buy a diffrent gun.Pros1. Realistic look and feel2. Not too heavyCons1. Spring rifle, nuff said.2. Vertical grip is impossible to take off.3. You have to put the sights together.4. Cannot attach a silencer or a scope, not even a laser."
4,Perfect for the price,"i would have to say that this product is very good, considering some very important facts.1) it's under $102) it's manual3) it holds less than a single desert eagle clipthat being said, this gun really is exceptional, providing a nice balance of control with weight and ease of carrythe mag is somewhat shallow tho, so extra mags are a mustit is great for backyard brawls and CQB against other springs, but that's about it as a main weaponif you use this in a real match you definately wanna have backupa lot of backupBTW, the scope requires the attatch of a special shell atop the reciever, but doesn't fit flush against the receiver,in addition the scope is a simple lense with crosshair"
3,Not bad,"this gun is just okay. I haven't used it much cuz I just got it today. But I shoot it a bit.Pros:-good price-shoots fairly well-Nice feelCons:-Its very light-curves to the right-Did NOT come with any light, lazer, or anything electronic"
5,Fly Fishing Reading,"I found this ""For Dummies"" book very informative for a novice, well-written and witty, and covered much of the stuff a novice fly fisherman would want to know. And some that even a more experienced one could benefit from. JAT"
4,kaleidoscope beacon from mars and other psychedelic trips,"Hi! Very good,interesting collection from kaleidoscope psychedelic years. Worth of buing,tells a story of pleasent times of 60""s,when all is innocent and possible to make own kind of music,yes.Good compilation indeed!"
2,Overated,"Pros -- Easy to use -- entry level cameraCons -- Photo Print quality larger than 4 x 6 is very poor, lots of noise, colors do not seem natural. I would suggest that you spend a little extra money and buy the Nikon P-3 or P-4."
3,You're Really Buying the Instructions,"We've had a lot of fun by following the instructions in the package, which is essentially what you are buying - rope trick instructions that can be used with almost any cutable rope. If you can get the technique from a magic book or elsewhere, you would probably save some money by just buying a similar rope at a hardware store. That said, its still a neat trick."
3,It's kind of hard!,I was very pleased with the quality of this game when I received it. I bought it for my 7 year old grandson who is into hockey and loves to play games. So the perfect little game for him I thought. It is kind of hard. Even my daughter said it was hard. The recommended age started at 6 which I think is too young. He plays games that are for much older than his age and doesn't have any trouble. Maybe it will get easier the more he plays it??? I hope so.
1,I have still not received it!!,The item is on back order...they have promised me to send as and when available...I am not sure when...lets hope soon...
4,Fair Second Album by the 60's Bee Gees,"While ""Horizontal"" contains some very good tracks (Lemons Never Forget, And The Sun Will Shine, Harry Braff, Birdie Told Me, Daytime Girl, Earnest of Being George), and hits (World, Massachussetts), there is a few that definately do not hold my interest.You are better off getting this one as one of the last Bee Gees CDs if you are collecting their albums.Don't get me wrong it's not a ""bad"" album, but not a Great album like the 1st album."
3,Not quite as wonderful as I remembered,"I bought these because I was searching for the old-fashioned filled hard candy we used to get at Christmas. These were adequate, but not as beautiful as the ones I remember. And the fillings were a little on the pedestrian side. Also, I don't think this was a good value for the money I spent."
5,Must have for anyone coming up in the 70's,Sinbad is one funny dude. I came up in the 70's and he had me in stitches with this one. Don't matter if you're black or white he will have you rolling!
3,Afros & Bellbottoms,"I own the original VHS tape. This DVD was edited, and alot of key parts were missing. I would not have bought this DVD, if I knew portions had been cut out."
3,Sloppy follow up to Alterno-Daze - Origin of the Species,"Unlike the tightly woven tale presented by ""Alterno-Daze: Origin of the Species 2000 B.C. - ???"", ""Natural Selection - 90's"" is sloppy and unrepresentitive of the era. While attempting to hone in more on the alternative scene that inspired the title halfway through the CD, the music gets unpleasant, boring, or irrelavant. Stick with the original."
4,very nice,Very nice collection - hey anything with a cut by Material Issue is automatically four stars.
5,"Great Book, Great Man","Herbert Simon is an amazing figure in the world of science. A Noble winner in economics, a well-known contributor in psychology, and an expert in organizational study. People who know him always wonder how can he be so successful in different fields. By reading this book, you are able to get the light of the stories behind his success.As same as the papers he wrote for his research work, Simon's writings are always straightforward and intrigue you to think about the world we are living. When you read this book, it may change your thinking of this world. By reading his books, you would understand why simple human being will always have complex behavior.Though passed in Feb., 2001, Herbert Simon is an unforgettable figure to our lives."
1,Garbage,I bought this toy for my kids to play with in the pool (I had similar subs as a child which worked very well). The problem is that the submarine fills with water and them immediately sinks to the bottom and sits their. No matter how you set the dive-planes it is not neutrally buoyant and the motor does not have enough power to overcome the negative buoyancy. This thing should be sold at the dollar store or something. It is complete garbage.
5,nylabone super-tuff,Our French Bulldogs love these bones. They are just the right size for them to hold and chew. I know that their teeth and gums are healthier as a result of the Super-tuff bone. Be careful not to leave them laying around on the floor.....stepping on them with bare feet is painful.
1,Didn't recieve purchase,"I recently called and thought that i receieved the item for ""review"", but i actually didn't recieve this item yet and im still waiting for it, all the other purchases through Amazon for my dog were very good. Sincerely, Beth M"
5,"Beautiful designs, nicely explained","I ran across this title in a small shop in San Francisco's Chinatown. I was running short on cash, and was kicking myself within 24 hours for not purchasing this book. Hawley provides 300 cut paper designs used in traditional Chinese embroidery. Each design is in white on a solid color background (red, blue, black, brown, or purple). The designs are clear and easy to see and enjoy. A brief introduction gives a little background (I would have liked more) on this folk art, and an index at the beginning allows users to look up symbols of specific interest. Do that, but browse the rest of the book as well!An eight-page supplement at the end illustrates 160 symbols (including ideograms, trigrams from the I Ching, and pictoral symbols) used in traditional decorative arts along with their meanings. Fascinating!For those interested in learning more about Chinese art, or for those who just enjoy beautiful designs, this is an excellent choice."
3,Not Jackie but not bad none the less.,"If your looking for classic Jackie Chan Action then don't grab this off the shelf. But if your lookin for high flying action then this is a good film. Cassanova Wong is the star in this film about a young fighter caught in some trouble with a big time bad guy. With the help of an old master he sharpens his skills in hopes of bringing down this crime kingpin. Great fight scenes, and a good story. All though the quality of the film itself is not all that perfect the movie was."
1,"Good movie, bad transfer","This movie looks like a really bad VHS tape that's been copied several times and then soaked in salt water for a week. It's blurry and the sound is bad.We need a real version of this movie, which is otherwise excellent."
2,DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO!!!,"Whatever you do, do NOT buy this film. This is not Drunken Master 1 or 2. As a matter of fact Jackie Chan isn't even the star.(he's only in about 5 minutes of the movie.And, that's a clip from another movie!)The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the film has mediocore action."
5,One of my favorite Kung-Fu Movies,"If you are looking for an old school 80's style Kung-Fu movie with great choreography, a variety of styles (crane, snake, tiger claw, etc), and the English dubbing with Chinese mouth movements (sometimes continuing after an English sentence is completed), then this is the movie for you. The only thing missing is the high flying acrobatics such as jumping on the roof of a house. In addition to the above, the movie includes the amazing stunts and use of remote items (chairs stunts, buckets, brooms, etc.) that are common among Jackie Chan films. Drunken Master is a great movie that shows Jackie Chan's skills as a marital artist and the breadth of styles he is familiar with. Bravo!"
1,Disappointed,when i bought this title i was expecting a jacky chan movie but it turned out a jet lee movie though dvd cover indicates jacky chan but the actual content is not
5,The first no-hype book for online investors,This book can take you from zero knowledge of the market to a confident level of expertise in investing online. Most valuable is the fact that it's free of the breathless hype that clutters othe books about investing online.
4,hypocrisy revealed,"as if anyone with open eyes needed any further evidence of hillary's loathsome character, here it is. her two faced self serving nature, her self-perceived superiority, her vindictiveness, her hypocrisy, even anti-semitism........the list goes on and on. hopefully she never realizes her dreams of elected power."
5,Get it.,I've got the clear one and the gold one. This one really warms it up and it's great to use with tungsten lighting and wb on the camera.
2,"History, but not theology","For those interested in ONLY the historical Neibuhr, this book might fit the bill. There is almost no attention given to his theology, so I do not recommend it to readers who have no prior knowledge of Niebuhr. Without some understanding of his theology it's very difficult to understand why he has historical importance. Fox also (surprisingly) does not include much information on Niebuhr's influence on later important historical figures such as Martin Luther King."
5,"trio sound causes strange bodily reactions, film at eleven","I can't explain it--this recording literaly makes me salivate, as if I were thinking of a sumptuous meal or a great red wine. I also bounce my feet, bob and swing my head, smile stupidly, and dream of swinging like this trio. 'nuff said."
4,great retractable leash,It really pays to buy a quality flexible leash the Flexi line is all quality stuff and I would still be using my old one if my dog had not chewed thru the cord.Quick ship great price all is good
2,Smaller than expected,"I have two dogs, both about 30 pounds. I thought I was buying a similar one to the one I have but no. My hand does not fit into the handle. It's kind of useless."
3,light,"Not heavy duty like I expected for a 44lb dog. I'd expect it's for dogs under 20 lbs, but my dog is old & doesn't pull much, so it works for me. occasionally the chord gets caught inside & sticks si I have to play with it."
4,Nice CD for an introduction to Mid-East music,"I'm a novice and have just started investigating Mid-Eastern music so my opinion of this cd may change over time and experience. However, I found the music very beautiful and entertaining. And you can't beat the price (3.99 at time of review) if you're wanting an introductory CD."
2,NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST,"Except for one brilliant song(I Started a joke)and one really good(Kilburn Towers) this is really a very poor effort by the brothers Gibb. But if you happen to like this album and really need three versions of ""Kitty Can"" than this expanded edition is for you."
4,Bee Gees Idea,"Most people remember the Bee Gees from the disco era but they had a whole career before and after. This is from their pre-disco days. The sound is very dated from the late 60's British scene. Lots of horns, violins, and electric guitars. I personally think the lyrics from this time period in their careers is much more interesting than the music. Also if you like Robin Gibb's voice as much as Barry Gibb's, he features more prominently in this period as a lead vocal. If you dig the Bee Gees, Idea is a must for your collection!"
2,Won't Stand up to Professional Use,"David White's name is what lead us to this product. But when we received it, it was clear that overseas production or corner cutting has diminished the overall quality. The foot pegs on the tripod are made of plastic and would surely break off if too much pressure was applied in tougher ground. Additionally, a call to a recognized repair facility resulted in a virtual guarantee that we would be using their services in the not-too-distant future. Thankfully, we purchased via Amazon where we were able to easily return the unit and shop for something more durable. For the record, we found no optical builders levels still being manufactured in the US. All of them seem to be coming from China or India. Even the Japanese and Swiss manufacturers have moved their production facilities there."
1,"do not buy, useless","Just bought it for $4.99, hope I can return it still. The sound is terribly low, can barely hear anything. Useless is the right comment."
4,not too bad,"first of all. you got what you pay for. these little things a cheap, and they're so portable, and they're not ugly, and they don't use batteries. for all these reasons. these are not too bad."
5,This one's great!,"I've listened to this collections dozens of times and love mixing in tracks on cassette. This one's a treasure trove of beats and rhythms. Yeah, some of it has a basement tape quality, but the vocals are stunning."
1,A Toaster oven only and not a good one.,"This reaplaced a Cuisinart toaster/convection oven. It worked great but it had a painted finish and after 5 years of everyday use it was discolored and chipping. It was a true convection oven only taking 70% of the normal time to bake.Oster is not even a good toaster oven, the manual said that you have to preheat to toast. It does not signal when it is preheated. No digital controls!It takes longer to bake than a normal oven. Save your time and money and get a Cuisinart. Amazon accepted the return and I ordered a stainless steel Cuisinart from them. Pay the extra money and get the best!"
1,Do Not Purchase!,"Attractive item in good condition MISSING RACK! When contacted Amazon they first told me to return the entire applicance to get a new one with a rack. Then instructed to return product, that it is not an isolated issue and they cannot replace the missing part! If you purchase this you will only have to return it."
3,Rattles a lot,"This convection-toaster oven is okay I guess. I had an old Black and Decker and there product is definately better, but they have started making them bigger and bigger. I had a size constraint. This rattles a bit and seems very cheaply made. I would get a black and decker if I had to do it over again and just make room for a bigger one."
4,Pretty good,"This works well for the purpose that I need: making tons of waffles in the morning for my 4 kids. It does take longer than I would think it needs to toast things though but that's alright. It makes a great grilled cheese sandwich as well. It is easy to use, looks nice on the counter and is easy to clean."
1,Dangerous,"I received this toaster oven as a christmas gift. It worked fine for a few months until one day while making toast, BOOOOOM! Right before my eyes the toaster suffered a mini-explosion inside the toaster. Fortunately, it tripped the gfi (ground fault interrupter) and the flames died down enough that no one was hurt. I had black marks from the flame up the backsplash. We reset the breaker, my husband looked it over and couldn't see anything wrong, but we planned to throw this toaster in the trash and replace it with something that didn't explode. Later that week, we had company over, and while I was cooking, someone plugged in the toaster oven to heat up something small. BOOOOOOOM! This item is clearly dangerous. If several people had not been standing right there, our kitchen would have gone up in flames."
2,Broke after 6 months,Toasts bread okay if you set the temp. numb to 400 degrees or less. Does okay as an electric oven.Timer broke after 6 months of light use.I do not recommend this product.
2,They don't last very long......,"When working, this is a very good toaster & oven... However, we've gone through 2 of them in the past 6 years. The first one died 3 years ago and now my current one won't shut off!!"
4,"Oster 6295 6-slice Convection Toaster Oven, Red","This toaster oven works great and it's just the right size. I love that it comes in red, it matches my kitchen color scheme. This is a great appliance to have!"
4,Very good quality & features,Looked at many 6-Slice Convection Toaster Ovens and found this one to have the features and quality that we were looking for. Large interior and yet not a bulky exterior. Easy to remove crumb tray. Toaster settings are accurate. The rack moves forward when the door is opened. The door springs closed. All these things seem very basic but many of the other brands lacked some of these features. One brand had a crumb tray that was removable from the back of the toaster. Not a great idea!! You'll be happy with this one.
4,great but not as roomy as anticipated,"This toaster oven is great. Cooks well, toasts well, has automatic shut-off, etc. I guess it could toast 6 slices of very small bread, but it's certainly not as large as I anticipated when I saw that 6-slice denotation. Still, I'd buy it again because it functions well and looks great on my counter-top. We use it daily."
2,"Love it, but Dangerous!!!!","I am sad to say I had to return this oven. It works great, but it is extremely hot on sides and top, but even hotter on the polished metal trim around the front. If you can build a protective cabinet around it to protect from someone accidently bumping it while trying to reach for something, it would be a great oven to have. After having this oven for only one week, I had a guest injured with a severe painful burn on her forearm that will leave a permanant scar. The oven was placed on the countertop next to the range and while reaching over to turn off a burner her arm touched against the trim which was about 450 degrees; the outer metal reaches the same temp as the oven setting."
3,"6-slice Oster toaster oven, red","The dials are very hard to read, small black letters on a red background. The toast setting frequently burns the toast if I don't watch and turn it off in time."
2,There are better toaster ovens out there.,"Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off. For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).Cons: The toaster part is horrible. This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time. Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn't work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off. Also, the bottom rack is completely useless when toasting, so the fact that they are touting this as a 6-slice toaster oven is misleading."
2,Oster toaster oven,I'v had this toaster over for about 1 year now and now it takes longer to cook items. Pizza use to take about 10 mins. on toast now it takes about 13-15mins. Bagel use to take about 10 mins now it takes about 13 mins.
1,Junk,"I made the mistake of buying this from Amazon about 5 months ago and not returning it, mostly out of laziness and figuring it would do okay. Every single thing I bake in this oven cooks way faster on the left side. I have to take out a pizza and rotate it so it doesn't get burned on one side. Pizzas are generally undercooked in the middle, and the toppings and outside edge are always black. Same thing happens with garlic bread, sandwiches, etc. Sometimes stuff cooks too fast, sometimes takes forever.I've not found 1 thing that this oven can do better than the $25 toaster oven I bought at Walmart 10 years ago. As far as the design goes, the temperature dial is horrible. The graduations are seemingly random -- you can't tell if you have it on 375 degrees because the graduations aren't broken into logical chunks. You just guess for some temperatures. It's also noisy as hell. I can't tell you how much I regret not returning this. I am going to throw it out and buy something else."
2,"Great oven, but seriously dangerous!","Between my office, my home, and my parents, we all have this model toaster oven. We all got it from Costco for about the same price.As an oven and toaster it works great - You do have to be a little careful about toast since its easy to burn bread if you're not careful about the settings.But the one thing I wanted to share with everyone is that they need to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL because the built in timer does not always function properly.Usually you turn the knob which is like an egg timer, when it hits zero, it is supposed to turn the oven off.Unfortunately, if you are doing a short period of time (for example, under 5 minutes), the timer is PRONE TO BECOMING STUCK BEFORE REACHING ZERO, AND THUS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF THE OVEN, NOR MAKE A DING.This makes it extremely dangerous in that if you are not constantly watching your oven, you will either burn your food to a crisp, or worse, start a fire.All three ovens we have purchased exhibit this issue."
1,not right,"I bought this oven with moderate expectations. What I've found is the oven works great, but the toaster won't heat. I'm getting rid of this and never buying another Oster toaster again."
5,toaster oven,"Hello - my wife and I use our toaster oven multiple times a day now for well over a year. We use it to toast bagels, toast, make frozen chicken nuggets, french fries, heat up pizza, garlic bread, toasted almonds, pine nuts etc. It is an awesome unit and we'd never go back to a toaster ever again. It doesn't take up that much space on your counter and it heats up VERY quickly. I strongly recommend this Oster oven."
2,"Gigantic, slow slow slow toaster","This is almost the size of a microwave oven. It is easily the slowest toaster I have ever used. It's a decent oven and can hold a lot of food. A full dinner plate can fit in this unit. I do not like the cheap twist timer, it's just not accurate but who cares? It takes so long to toast you end up standing by it waiting and waiting and..."
2,great until it quit working after 3 years,"I loved this toaster oven until it quit working 3 years after I bought it. My last toaster oven lasted 13 years, and my mom's last one lasted 15 years, so I really expected at least a decade out of this thing. It seems to be an electrical problem, because it sometimes worked and sometimes didn't for a couple months, then totally quit. The timer makes clicking sounds but it doesn't heat up and the indicator light doesn't come on. Anyway, it was a bummer. So if you want a toaster oven that will last a few years, this is a great one. If you expect your small appliances to last longer than a pet hamster, you might want to look elsewhere."
4,Hot Stuff,If you have a toaster use it. Otherwise this is worth the price and more. Works well and heats up faster than my old one. Yes I would recommend it as I was a little apprehensive since it was an Oster. I thought they only made blenders but they make a good oven also.
3,Toaster oven more oven than toaster,We bought this item for a double purpose -- to toast and to bake small meals. We found that it is just too big to quickly and evenly toast bread. It does a pretty good job with thawing and toasting thicker items -- like a square of corn bread -- but it's slow.
2,"Flashlight Good , Knife Bad","The Flashlight is a pretty cool item. Feels substantial, and is relatively bright for how small it is.On the other hand, the knife is a complete piece of garbage. I have bought better knives at Circle K. Blade is loose and has a lot of play. I bought this to give as a gift to a friend and now I cant, I would be much too embarrassed to hand him this pile of horribleness."
4,Excellent Instrumentals...,"This cd is very nicely done for Hawaiian Favorites. Listen to the demos, I recommend it."
2,Nowhere Near Worth It,"What is selling this book is the essay Fourth State of Matter, which originally appeared in the New Yorker, and which is genuinely quite good. The rest are just sappy personal reflections on girlhood. Or at least they seem like that to me. We need to be ashamed as American readers if in fact this is literture we're claiming is worth reading."
1,worthless,this book is terrible. i tried the first 7 chapters and aside from not teaching me any new vocabulary it bored me to death. it is basically a generic dolphin story set on a tropical island with white beaches and blue water where a teenage girl and a poor native fisher guy who dreams of school befriend a dolphin and save its baby from the mean scientists. it is THE MOST BORING book i have read in several years and it does not deserve a glance. if i knew how to rate the book zero stars instead of one i would. it deserves -10.
4,Lots of vocab practice in a very casual read,"I purchased this for my niece teenage but gave a couple chapters a read before shipping it off to her. For it's purpose, it's not a bad text. Every page has about 5-10 SAT words interspersed throughout the text with the definitions on the bottom of the page. The writing does come off a bit mechanical and the dialogue is especially unnatural when using SAT words I feel that for the purpose of teaching vocabulary words in context, this is forgivable. It's to be read not as the next great American novel to torn apart for literary criticism but as a fun tool for SAT practice.In general, the writing is very easy to get through and the story in engaging enough. It reads like a take-to-the-beach novel but with random sentence that suddenly jump into academic language. Hardcore readers will probably be a little bored but if you take this book as it is - as an alternative to computer word games and flash cards - it's a great tool."
5,A truly inspiring journey......,"The moment you open ""I Wouldn't Die"", you're captivated by the many obstacles young Franco endures. From the sadness of near death experiences to the humorous story of Italian Sausages brought to America, it becomes clear this boy has a purpose. As you continue through each chapter, it's as though you're right there with him experiencing every journey: the highs and lows, the love, the laughter and the tears. The writing comes straight from the heart; you can just feel his passion for life.This book will not only keep you entertained but it will touch your heart. ""I Wouldn't Die"" is truly an inspiring book that will motivate you and make you just want to get out there and absorb all that life has to offer."
4,Fellowes Powershred 450Cs,"We have used our shredder over the last few weeks and so far it has worked very well. The paper shredding is cut into very fine particles.The one thing that I think is a concern is the credit card shredding. We had some old credit cards that we shredded, but it only cuts the cards into strips and does not do the cross cut. So we would cut the strips into pieces with sissors after running them into the shreader. Not a real big deal but just not comfortable leaving credit cards in strips only.Other than that the machine itself works great."
5,Fellowes Powershred MS 450C,The machine is quiet and thorough in cutting up documents into small pieces. It has an auto stop feature to prevent overheating. It also has a safety feature to prevent hands from getting too close the the shredder opening. The safety feature can sometimes be activated when there is no hand nearby. It adjusts quickly however. The product fully meets my expectations for home use.
2,Heats up fast.,Bought this for my office. Got too hot to use after 4 minutes of continuous use. Bought a more expensive one hoping it would work for longer than light periodic shredding. No such luck.
1,Confetti all over the place,"I had the shredder for perhaps a week, and then I had to change the bag. I used all the oil they told me to use, but somehow the works must have gotten clogged, because after that time, more confetti got onto the floor, or the outside of the machine, than into the bag.I don't use the shredder any more. It sits in my laundry room as an emergency device, in case I ever absolutely, positively have to shred something. (Too bad I don't have a fireplace: burning would be a lot easier, if you ask me.)Once bitten, twice shy: I won't buy any shredders ever again, especially not the type that make paper into confetti. Maybe if someone gave me a free, el-cheapo ""strip"" shredder, I'd use it. You know what? It's just as easy to tear stuff up with my hands, or use my scissors."
4,One of the best summer reading books ever!,"Time may not have been on my side with this book, as summer was closing and I was frantically reading this book as well as two others. I feel as though this novel caught me in a way that none other has yet. It seemed to teach more about myself than any novel ever could. It showed me more about foolish pride than any person could ever advise me. I own the Cliffs notes, however I did not need them. This is an easily-read novel, and the Penguin Classics version shows the two-fold meaning of the political and fantasy novel. Because of the footnotes, I learned more about the novel than any teacher could ever even attempt to achieve. If you are required to read this novel, or would just like to give it a try, I strongly recommend it, and I also recommend that the reader tries to purchase a copy of the Penguin Classics version."
3,Gulliver's Travels,"I enjoyed this,at times a bit slow. I think he needs to return to the sea, his return home left him disgusted with his own."
5,Review On Gulliver's Travels,"I enjoyed Gulliver's Travels because it is not just an adventure story but a book of criticms and opinions by the author, Johnathan Swift. For instance,in the lst country Gulliver visits is ruled by horses. He does not want to go back to England because tgher is politcians, lawyers, theives, and drunks there. Horses do not have those things. I think what Swift was trying to say was thatif humans had the minds of horses then life would be a whole lot better. Throught the whole story Gulliver meets many interesting people. He meets tiny people, large people, and magicians. The only thing I did not like about this book was that it was a little hard to understand in some parts."
1,Gulliver's Travels,"Don't waste your time!!! The only good part of this book was the beginning, and then all it talks about is the legal system in England. This is the first time that I have ever said that the book is better than the movie."
4,"Original, a must read book, but average interest holder.","This book is original and you must read it. It is average for it's interest holding ability. Sometimes really great, other times really boring."
3,A Journey without Closure,"Throughout the novel, I was very interested and I thought Swift was making some good points about society and how we view things, but the ending is lacking and I was confused as to what the theme was."
5,Excellent!,This was the first book I read from start to finish on my Kindle. I love Swift's political/social satire and I honestly felt like improving myself to the best of my yahoo abilities when I reached the conclusion. The Kindle version read just fine on my device. I remember experiencing none of the major complaints in formatting I've read about in other reviews (that's not to say they weren't there but that any formatting issues were so minor I passed over them without a second thought).This book is a must-have for everyone with a Kindle or Kindle app!
1,Very good read.,As though things went on you did not see Gulliver give up. Reminded he sort of gave me the inspiration to finish my piano lessons
1,No stick,Bought this for my daughter's IPOD it worked for a couple days but now it won't stay on the device and just slips right off. Guess its my fault for judging/choosing a product by its cover
2,disappointing performance,"This solvent is a mediocre performer. Since it does appear to be less toxic than many others, I gave it two stars. However, it does not perform nearly as well as other solvents on the market. Although other solvents require more care when using them, they are much more effective. I recommend using other solvents and simply using the appropriate care required."
3,Viva Bukowski But This Isn't The Good Stuff,"My shelf of Bukowski's poetry and prose is testament to the tremendous pleasure I've taken over the last twenty-five years reading his work. He's unique, and although at first he may strike you as a guilty pleasure at best, he's profound. He's also detested by some -- especially women who consider him misogynistic. Decide for yourself, but don't judge him by this book, which is about as close to hack work as he's come -- although Bukowski's hack work beats a lots of others' best. Try Women, The Most Beautiful Woman in Town, or Mockingbird Wish Me Luck."
2,Boring,"I started this book but it just couldn't hold my attention. I skimmed to the end and felt no need to actually read most of the book. Fortunately, I got it free on Kindle - so no loss."
2,Not a great read,"This was a disappointing novel. I kept going with it for a few chapters, but it was not well written and a bit predictable and cheesy. I've just deleted it from my Kindle. Wouldn't recommend it."
4,must read if in TV News,"If you work in or around TV News anchors, this is a must read. It shows the cut throat world the business can be. The veteran anchor vs. the wannabe-anchor. We can all relate to at least one of the characters in the book."
3,Good story. Too long,I enjoyed it. It was an interessting story. The vilain was a bitch which gave the story some spice. The story needed to be about 1/3. Shorter. The same thoughts were repeated over an over from different angles which was excessive. overall it was good.
3,"Good book, bad editing","This was a good book. The characters were easy to relate to, and the plot was good. The dynamic between Natalie and all those around her made me want to keep reading the book to see how things would end for her. I agree with a few of the other reviews, though, the poor editing did make the book hard to read."
2,The media: worts and all,"I read about 1/3 of this book and couldn't care less about any of the characters. Does anyone really care about the female talking heads who read the and who mostly look alike: blonde, blue eyed, no personality? I tried and tried to get through it, but I finally deleted it from my Kindle."
5,Am reading this now,"I am reading this right now and it's definitely worth your time. I am enjoying it so much! Great characters and involves the TV news industry. If you are a read-a-holic, you will like this book."
2,Slow start,"I had a really hard time getting into this book. It probably took me a week to read the first tree chapters. Once I got past this first part of the book it went a little fast. From the very beginning everything that could go wrong does. Natalie Daniels is a news anchor that is getting ""old"". She is dealing with a separation from her husband, her career is going down the tubes and she is struggling to find a new one. Everything she does ends up hurting her or her career.I think I paid 1.99 for this on my kindle anything more then that and I would have been upset."
5,Fast-Paced and Sexy,"From the first chapters of FALLING STAR, it becomes readily apparent that this book was written by a person with not only absolute mastery over the art of modern story-telling, but first-hand knowledge of the cut-throat television news business. Dempsey's book is a must-read for anyone who has entertained the idea of work in television news, been looking for a fun, poolside read, or both! I would recommend this book to everyone I know without hesitation!"
1,Needs proofreading and editing!,"I decided to try reading this book because of the glowing reviews, but in order to carry a reader along, one has to care about at least one of the characters. None of these characters are even likable. Then, as others have pointed out, this book needs a good editor. Since I was an editor up until a few years ago, it irked me that there were so many misspellings and grammatical errors, even use of wrong words in some sentences, and run-on sentences or incomplete phrases and sentences. This writer needs to link up with a really good editor, as it's obvious she doesn't know how to write a decent sentence. Further, if she writes another book, she needs to make some character in the book, preferably the protagonist, likable. I am about 50 percent into the book and am thinking I am just going to stop reading it; it isn't worth my time."
3,A good read,"Diana Dempsey has done an excellent job with this story. I do not know a lot about the newspaper business but the interplay between the characters involved was very well done. The people are believable and they are interesting and exciting. Am sure that there are more to come.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
3,falling star,"Enjoyed this book very much, the author very sensative upon writing of this couple, very much in love. I truly did enjoy her book."
2,"Disappointing, and a dull read","Photo Projects is a disappointing book. First of all, much of the specific information about resources for publication has to do with the UK (the author is British). There are some useful general pointers at the beginning of each chapter about having projects published, portfolios, etc, but the author doesn't really address those things in the rest of the text. As a writer, this guy's a dud. Also, for my taste, the photography isn't very interesting. Bleh. This is the only photo-related book I've purchased that I've regretted. Save your money."
2,"Sadly, a disappointment","I'm reviewing the audio version of this book.I'm sad to say, I didn't even finish listening to it, which is a bad sign in a murder mystery, when I don't even care that much who did it. The narrator was ok, but his accents were really exaggerated which I didn't enjoy. The story was a little dull and very slow moving and repetitive. Anne Perry always does a good job and creating a setting, but even this fell somehow flat. Sorry, but not a favourite of mine."
1,A true disappointment.,"Ms. Perry's latest is sadly lacking in all the elements that generally make her fiction delightful. The characters are unformed, the plot is shaky at best, the background data of the making of the new sewers of London after the death of Prince Albert is so sparce that she simply repeats (entirely too often) the same bare facts that shifting earth and wandering underground waterways make all such excavations dangerous. I was profoundly disappointed at the lack of care that went into this novel since the series itself has been so satisfying up to this point."
1,Negativity,"I was very excited to get my Golden Retriever in a couple weeks, however, after reading just the beginning of this book... HOLY NEGATIVITY! I know there are pros and cons to dog ownership, but where are the PROS in this book? It's almost like it's trying to talk you out of getting one! ""Don't do this"" ""Dont do that"" ""The dog will eat everything you own"" ""The dog will chew your house apart"" ""The dog gets separation anxiety"".It's not teaching me anything, it's listing the flaws of a Golden Retriever (or dogs for that matter)!"
5,Like new; speedy service,I received the book in a very short time. It was in like-new condition with the CD still in the sealed carrier inside the back cover. This was a completely satisfying transaction.This is a one-of-a-kind book for anyone who needs to get serious about rendering text and graphios on different output devices. WYSIWYG printing is not as easy as MFC might make it sound. Vic explains the intricacies of working with fonts and graphics. This purchase was to replace an earlier copy of the book that was damaged over time. I recommend it to anyone who needs more than the Microsoft documentation about how MFC works.
5,This book changed my life,"I read this book at age 18 after getting interested in psychiatry by an author named Karl Menninger. Freud's essay, Civilization and Its Discontents, has had the greatest impact on my life out of any book or experience. Within this short book he had taken my whole view of the world, turned it upside-down, and added an exclamation point. To understand this book doesn't require great intellectual power but rather mental capacity i.e, a capacity to receive a massive dose of pessimism! I would add almost as a warning that Freud's implied philosophy is almost conducive to depression in a maladjusted mind! If you want hope or faith, this is not for you. Regardless, everybody should read this book."
4,thx,i got this book 2nd i ordered 3 at the same time. i was so happy to get it. the book arrived promptly and in good condition.
4,Very interesting look at society.,"This was the first book by Freud that I've read, and now I see why he was so successful. He had a brilliant mind and was a very effective writer."
2,The end.,"I can understand why they split up after this album. According to CCR history, John Fogerty allowed the other band members,including his brother, to have more control over direction, song selection, and production on this release. The result was fatal. But, I would replace the cd if necessary because of the input by Fogerty. It's still decent music."
2,CCR's last hurrah,This is the last studio album recorded by CCR and was recorded as a threepiece since the departure of Tom Fogerty. Although his presence is not missed by the band you can really tell that they were running on fumes by then. I only purchased this cd to complete my Creedence collection.
1,CCR OPD,"This is one bad album from a once great band. Well, as a quartet CCR never made a bad 33 1/3, but as a trio they stunk. The trios live album ""Live In Europe"" was a fake (read my review) and their one studio work was a bad joke. I bet Tom Fogerty was laughing at this release. By 1972, Creedence was officially pronounced dead!01. Lookin' for a Reason - 4/1002. Take It Like a Friend - 1/1003. Need Someone to Hold - 3/1004. Tearin' Up the Country - 4/1005.

2,Umm No,"It has a pretty good plot line but what's plot? The writing style is weak, and it sounded childish."
4,"Dark Atmospheres, Vivid Storytelling, Deep Emotions","Krik? Krak! forces the reader into a world in which many people suffer, men are forced upon women, and mothers lament over their dead children. Krik? Krak! is an extremely deep novel that creates a deep sympathetic feel in the reader, even if he/she was ignorant to any of the events in Haiti. If ever you thought that the world was perfect, then this book brings you outside of that box, for Edwidge Danticat acts as the voice for all those silenced Haitians and tells a tale that may have been left untold for so long. This book is far from your average historic novel, it goes so deep into the emotion, into the thoughts, into the physical feel of the characters, that even you cannot help but admire the context of the book.This book proved to me that the world really isn't perfect, and I doubt it will ever be. It caught me slightly off guard at times, but Edwidge's writing style captivates you and forces you into the book once again."
1,Not realistic,"To be honest I got about 20 pages into this book before I decided I wouldn't finish it. I passed it off to my cousin, since he is the one who told me I HAD to read this book. Although I was not born in Haiti, both of my parents were and thus my entire life has been enwtined in both American and Haitian culture. I am also recieving my graduate degree in writing. Therefore as both a Haitian, and a writer I cannot give this book good reviws. She can write...fine. But what about the substance? What about the THING that makes me want to keep reading? I was particulary annoyed that she didn't stay true to our culture. There were moments when I wanted to scream at her,"" You know we don't do that!"". I haven't given up on her and plan to read more of her work, but she better wow me the next time."
4,Good and affordable,"This string is nice for the money. I've played tennis all my life and am now 24. This string has been a lot easier on my elbow than some of the other prince, Wilson, and head string types I've used. It's got good control, a solid feel, but maybe not quite as much ""pop"" as some of the better strings I've used. Durability is good, I play with a lot of spin and pretty aggressively and have made it through about 10 hours of play without breaking a string yet, although it is starting to look a little frayed in places."
4,Excellent,"Truly gripping dramatic study of the heroin trade. The flow between storylines is handled perfectly. Some dialogue is a bit stilted and some aspects of the plot are not completely credible, but understood as an allegory this miniseries makes a strong link between Third World poverty and despair, criminality, unbridled affluence, the failings of Western societies and the misery of the international drug trade. Next time you hear a politician spouting off about the need for a ""war on drugs"", ask them if they've watched this series."
4,Rather intresting,I had to watch the Miniseries for a class and write a 12 page paper on it about one of the characters.... Some points in the movie were long and could have been made shorter and to the point. But over all it was rather intresting and showed the many sides that Heroin Production covers and who it affects and how. From the Drug dealer to the drug user to the Drug Manufacter....
1,Mine broke too!,"So far I've bought three of these at one of the big box stores because it's the only kind they carry. After the first pair snapped, I was very careful but to no avail. I finally wised up and am checking Amazon for my next pair."
1,"Boke, just like the others","Went to put them on and the band snapped. I wasn't pulling on them hard or anything. They were OK before they broke, nothing special. Not sure it is going to be worth it to call the company to replace them."
5,Heatwarming True Story,"This book tells a true story of colonial Africa. It chronicles how one man's love for Africa laid the foundation for growth in the early years of the last century. It describes how he overcame any number of challenges to hold onto his dream, and ultimately contributed to the current state of the nation."
2,What do you expect for 20 bucks?,"My biggest dissapointment with this product was how difficult it was to hook up to my computer. It uses RCA plugs, and even with my expensive sound card with lots of different connections on the front and back of my pc I had to spend an hour searching for an adapter to make it work. The sound quality and bass are also much worse than I expected, but I suppose you get what you pay for."
2,portable but lacking quality,"To put in batteries is difficult. The ear pads you have to take off are plastic and foam. Very hard to take off, too easy to tear up.The product literature says the unit provides effective ear protection only if the foam pads are in good shape. It further says that the foam pads have a lifetime of about 6 months."
4,Good Buy,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my father who is an avid hunter. We took a hunting trip the following weekend and everyone there was very impressed with its performance in both deer stands and shooting ranges. Installing/changing the batteries is a bit of a pain with clarification needed on the directions, but that is our only complaint. I am getting a second pair for his birthday in March. Solid purchase!"
4,Hearing Protectors,Product was received timely and in good shape. I've been using them for pheasant hunting as I need to protect my remaining hearing. They are comfortable to wear hunting and the low profile doesn't interfere with shooting. Battery life has been good thus far and I'm on the original set of batteries after about a week of hunting. The only down side is the background sound that they pick up & you have to get used to. I knew from other reviews I should anticipate this & it's of minor concern for me as I've gotten used to it. For the price they are just what I needed.
3,size vs comfort,"I purchased the 6-S ear muffs for the size, full size muffs get in my way when shooting and I don't care for ear plugs. They work as stated and fit fine but the comfort level for long term where is not so good. They mention that the pads wear out in 6 months, which I thought odd because I have muffs a lot older than 6 months that I never replaced anything on. The interior foam will wear out on these for sure, do to the fact that they make contact with your ears. This is what makes them hot and uncomfortable for long term wear (3-4 hours). Not to mention your glasses ""must"" have wire frames or the muff becomes useless, there is no extra room in the cup for the arms of your eye wear."
3,Works but for how long?,"As others note, battery insertion is pretty hard and takes enough force that the plastic must be close to breaking. My first set of these worked for an hour and then one earpiece stopped amplifying and instead it started buzzing and whining. Amazon quickly replaced them (good job Amazon) and the new set has worked so far. And I didn't break them putting in the batteries, but maybe next time? Anyway, low profile, good at blocking sound, and the audio gain is sufficient to help with hearing people talk."
3,Peltor Tactical rtisky to open,"The Peltor Tactical is a very good hearing protector. My only problem was figuring out the instructions for opening ear parts to insert (and remove) the batteries. It also took considerably more force to open the covers than is practical for frequent removal of the batteries (as suggested in the instructions). Otherwise, no problems."
3,Great protection but design flaws,"This would have been 5 stars except for a couple flaws:1. It's difficult to remove the cups to replace the batteries despite their warning that they should not be stored for extended periods of time with batteries.2. It requires 4 batteries, 2 for each side.3. The control knobs are situated very close to the hinges and may inadvertently switch them to the on position.The actual protection is outstanding.I also have theHoward Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffwhich does not have ""active"" hearing protection (or at least not as apparent or dramatic as these) yet designed much better as far as usability. Changing the batteries is as easy as it is on your TV remote control and only requires 2 batteries total.These will be used as my primary ear protection until the batteries run out, then I'll be switching back to the HL and will be in no hurry to replace the batteries."
2,where do you put the batteries????,Ok these things workbut I have had them amonth now and still can not find where to put battery ini would not buy againno support online anywhereI have another pair of electronic ear protectores that I Will look to buy a more ofnot these.And where and how do you put batteries in these?????
4,Excel Bible 2003,"I bought this as a reference book for the office after taking an advanced Excel class. Everyone in my office uses it and the power pack that comes on the CD included with the book adds awesome tools and macros to the program. The only drawback is that most of the add-in programs on the CD are only 30-day trials, so you have to pay for them after a month."
4,Good reference book,"My proficiency level with Excel is not that high, so when I started a new job that required more Excel knowledge than I have, I bought this book based on the positive feedback it received. I have been very pleased with the book. I have not read it cover-to-cover, but it has worked well for what I need, which is mostly just for looking up how to perform specific tasks. For me, the index is the most important part of any technical book. I want to be able to find what I need as quickly as possible, and the index in this book has been great."
2,Excellent - for people who never used Excel before!,"Perhaps I expected too much, but this book is so voluminous that one assumes it should contain all the answers to Excel related questions (as many people believe the books of `Bible' type should :-). On my second try, I was greatly disappointed to find that the only reference on important programming function `ADDRESS' is a one-line definition! So, if you never used Excel before, I guess this book would be a good place to start. Otherwise, continue to search for the true Holly Book elsewhere."
2,This is not really a good compilation of dancing tracks...!!!!,"This ""Motown Dance"" compilation of ""dancing music"" hits, has a very, very pretentious title for its real content.Main tunes this CD is worth for: the magnificent ""Love Hangover"" by Diana Ross (what a song, dude! It's really good: it has rhythm, excellent performance and a very catchy melody), ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" by Thelma Houston, and even ""Dancing In The Streets"" by the wonderful Martha & The Vandellas.For serious Disco & Dancing Music collectors only."
4,Essential compilation to have in your reggae collection.,"I got this album primarily for Blake Boy's ""Lord Deliver Us"" which is one of only 2 recordings I am aware of that he made. I'm not cocmpletely in love with this CD, but nevertheless it's an important one to have, and there are a couple of great tracks on it. I's definitely the old ""roots of reggae"" type reggae. You arent gonna hear perfectly refined rhythms and Bob Marley / Jimmy cliff comparable stuff. But it's got some great CDs to throw into the mix for a cool summertime cocktail party. I will be enjoying it and very glad I purchased it. I must say Blake Boy's ""Lord Deliver Us"" is one awesome song though and for the price I paid (about $8 after shipping) that one song was almost worth it to me alone."
4,TUFF STUFF,"Queen Majeeda will definatley get your attention, I am truley surprised that she hasnt done anything else and when you listen to this cd you'll understand why I say that. She is a great artist and heavily influenced by LKJ and Mutabaruka, this aint no IRIE reggae music! and it aint no one hit wonder either, every song on the album is good! My favorite is GYE NYAME (listen to sample) I FEAR NO ONE ACCEPT JAH . A must for any serious rasta, Trust me mon! The only bad thing is that if your a deadbeat dad, #3 - OH DADDY might hurt a little, the truth usualy does. PEACE"
4,Escape to Hidden Beach,"This CD stays in my car...Makes my drive to where ever like an ""Escape to Hidden Beach"", these are not ordinary remakes from Hip Hop to Smooth Jazz, these songs evolve into a life of their own, artfully combining the Fresh ""Funky Jazz and Smooth Hip Hop"", especially the two 50 Cent songs and Lean Back, my only complaint was the extra ""All Fall Down"", song."
3,for the collectors,Princess is a one hit singer. She got Say I'm Number One and After The Love Has Gone as hits when produced by the british trio Stock Aitken Waterman in the 80's. This is her second album and it has some interesting slows that showcase her very particular matallic voice. It's not memorable but if you are a collector it's a hard to find cd
3,?,"Ryan Reynolds is hot and his character was hot- personiality-wise too! It was funny. It would have been better with someone other than tara reid cast. Can't decide who though, there are alot of great actresses."
3,fire safe,"THIS ITEM, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PRODUCT, WAS A RIP-OFF IN THE RESPECT THAT I FOUND THE SAME PRODUCT AT LOWE'S FOR NEARLY $150.00 LESS. PLUS THE ADD STATED IT WAS A TWO HOUR SAFE, AND IT IS ONLY A ONE HOUR.BUY YOUR SAFE AT LOWE'S, NOT AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Foodservice Organizations,"Need text for course, but actually interesting content. Would recommend to those going into food service/management."
2,Quality issue..,This backpack would work fine for gym clothes or storing extra sneakers in a school locker. Does not work as a book bag. Tears easily and strings break.
5,Awesome lighter!,"This lighter is for true anime fans. I mean who doesnt like a cool samurai on their lighter? I don't smoke, I just like the look of it. *(Also, like all Zippo lighters, you must buy the fluid yourself)*"
2,The Kids are NOT All Right,"Excellent cast. Spotty script. Viewer must be prepared for inclusion of porn. I thought the way porn was introduced was too direct and detracted from the storyline. However, I may just be a fuddy-duddy. Anyway, it became apparent at story's end that ""The kids were not all right""."
2,"Acting yes, story no.","In terms of acting, it's a great film. Each character is fleshed out to the point where they seem like real people. The problem with slice of life pictures like this, is they often don't offer a reason to watch. It's so much like life that is boring. Nothing ever happens. I don't mean that there needs to be explosions, or car chases or death. But beyond a few arguments, there is nothing here to make someone feel like the story should have ever been told, if there were a story at all.Conflict sure.Climax... sorta....Resolution... not really.Just, a few bickers, a flighty affair, and then, nothing.Nothing is changed, solved or resolved.Again, actors are great, the story is not."
3,Really Hated the Ending,"Just seems this story was written by a couple of disgruntled, man-hating lesbians. Felt bad for the Ruffalo character at the end, and was surprised there wasn't some sort of closure that allowed him to be seen as anything more than the interloper Bening's character so nastily called him. (I guess that was supposed to be her ""triumphant moment"" - proving herself right all along about his ""full-of-himself"" character, and putting him in his PLACE, by GOLLY!) He was not an interloper. What happened was not all his fault. And he didn't go looking for that family - the kids went looking for him.I thought the acting was great and the story too. But the ending was totally unsatisfying. I felt cheated, both for myself, and for Ruffalo's character."
5,Kids Are All Right DVD,"Literally no words. I honestly forgot if I bought it used or new, but it doesn't matter because it looked like new. It was spotless, wrapped up, and the disc has NO scratches on it. I'm very pleased."
2,Catty lesbians are catty,"If you want to watch two lesbian moms with little affection for each other fight over a two dimensional sperm donor their kids discover and can handle poor editing, you'll love this movie."
2,Unimpressed,"Frankly I'm really sorry I bought this DVD. Firstly it had an area code on it which wasn't compatible with my DVD player - bang goes $27. So I decided to bite the bullet and buy one locally,(another $30), only to find it wasn't the light-hearted entertainment it was advertised as. If you like porn get this movie; it's peppered with porn and really doesn't add anything to the plot. Story line was going nowhere and did just that. Pretty ordinary really. Only plus was an exceptional performance from Annette Benning."
1,Not at all what I expected.,"Very disappointing! I love Mark Ruffalo in movies, but this combo didn't work and the way the movie ended up going wasn't necessary!"
1,Overated,"Not sure what all the praise was about. A bunch of smug, entitled unhappy people doing nothing much. Skip it."
4,Despite poor viewing experience a Good Film,Have yet to see a better American movie this year. Mia Wasikowska somehow held her own against a strong performance by Bening. Wasikowska may have been the best actor in the film. Moore overacted in a few scenes but her character seemed to be written that way. The story didn't seem contrived or overly precious at all. Just a good story well told.
4,It's pretty darn good,This respirator is great. I use it for protecting against nuisance dust inhalation and working with various powder chemicals. It definitely filters and seals well; I tested it with a room full of a bittering agent to make sure it worked.
5,Very pleasantly surprised. Excellent book.,"Have seen Wilhelm at the Horse Expo a couple of times now and really enjoyed the demonstrations. Got the book somewhat reluctantly, most of these are SO dry and hard to follow, but this one really works. Easy to understand and written with nice stories and examples. Really enjoyed the pictures too - so many books are just pictures of the trainer - nice to see the focus be on the people who own horses rather than someone's ego. Anyway - great book - just straightforward approach to foundation training that should work for pretty much anyway. I was happy to have been wrong about what I was expecting. Nice job guy!"
2,"Not a true ""black and white"".","The quality of the this product is perfect. It is very elegant. The description says ""black and white"". The color is cream instead of white. I am sending back. It does not match my office color scheme and makes the drapery look dirty. The price was the best on the internet. Sorry I could not make it work."
5,"An Exceptional, Bizarre Tale","I hold WWII soldiers with the highest honor and am always prepared for a great tale. This is nowhere near what I expected but was fascinating nonetheless and fills in holes of the war in other parts of the world where occupation was the fight vs. actual battles.A boat is sent from England to Norway but upon arrival is immediately detected. How can one man survive in occupied territory where he can trust only a few who he must meet without knowing they can be trusted? How does he survive trying to walk across a mountain and becoming snow blind prior to wandering into a farmhouse to the bewilderment of its inhabitants? How can he be carried out of a country since he is incapacitated and how long can a man live isolated in the high country with no food?This tale of survival is just epic and keeps opening your eyes to new mundane challenges! I do recommend this book. Yes, it could have stood to be 50 pages shorter but overall, a very good read."
4,"Wow, what a story!","This is the ultimate survival tale - a man who survived a German attack is stranded in the Arctic for months during the winter and lives to tell his tale. The book was a little hard for me to get into at first, but it is worth pushing past some of the dry parts. Jan's tale is inspiring on several levels - not only did he refuse to die despite the fact that the odds were repeatedly against him, but he encountered so much help along his journey from people who risked their lives to move him to safety. Some parts of the story are a bit long, but overall this was a wonderful read."
4,Get book!,This is an excellent book about the will to survive through terrible situations. It also includes the kindness of one person toward another person. Many people risked their own lives and well-being to protect another person from the hatred of the Nazis. This book is well worth the time to read it.
4,Sobering experience of an extraordinary will to live,"A factual and interesting story of sacrifice, survival and patriotism amongst the cruel artic climes of WW 2 occupied Norway."
4,Incredible story,"The amount of adversity that Jan overcomes is hard to really grasp. At times the author bored me with a bit too much detail regarding certain events, but overall an easy read that is worth the time."
4,Unbelievable story!,"This is one amazing story! The heroism of Jan Baalsrud and the strangers he met along his journey are the stuff of great fiction, but it really happened. I found some of the descriptive information hard to follow, but still couldn't put the book down because of the story itself. It was worth plodding through some of the prose to get to the action. I highly recommend this book mainly because of the heroism of these ""ordinary"" people. Wonder if this sort of human being exists still today???"
5,Blessed Vocals,Lexi is very talented I love her voice it's beautiful.I remeber her first album Call Her Lexi.With her up lifting songs You Gave Me Love and I Been Thinking.Now she's back with a powerful message to the world with her new album Lexi And That's The Way It Is.She's blessed and God is really using her.
5,I can't believe I finally found this!,"I've been searching for this album for YEARS. I'm so relieved to see they reissued it! I have it on cassette (somewhere!) and haven't been able to find it, and nowhere, I mean NOWHERE ELSE can you find ""The Last Chant"". It's an absolutely brilliant song. Thank you to whoever re-released this!"
4,not what expected,"We could only use part of this item, the plastic pc that hang down. The white pcs that slide in the awning were to large to fit in the slide track and could not use them @ all."
2,Light Holder,"Cant say much for functionality of these hangers. Tried to install them for over an hour and finally just gave up. Although they may work on other RV awnings, they didn't on mine. I did end up using the rubber string part to just tie the party lights to the awning and it works to some extent."
4,Excellent!,Admittedly I'm a Steven Ivory fan. I've read his column in Electronic Urban Report from the beginning. This book exceeded even my expectations and leaves me looking forward to the next one......
3,An okay read,"This book was well written and engaging enough that I finished it, but I found it to be a rehash of the 90's and therefore rather out of date - White Supremacists are somewhat passe in my humble opinion. The style was of the book seemed rather self indulgent and the author's desire to establish genuine human connections with his interviewees seemed false - can you have a genuine connection with someone you're going to turn around and mock in a documentary and/or nonfiction book?All in all it was entertaining, just not great."
3,"Good,just not complete","This is a fairly easy read and the subject is quite interesting so it's overall worth a look. With that said, however I was expecting a more diverse subject matter; this book misses some categories of people, let alone certain individuals. Ike Turner is weird no doubt, but what about Michael Jackson or Prince? Where's a chapter on the Goth culture, or Pagean religious people? How about the Amish? Circus people? How about the eco terrorist groups or PETA? Instead there's 3 chapters devoted to right wing nuts and certainly some bias must of come into play not to cover the left wing nuts that prefer their own brand of anarchy. Still written well for what it covers."
2,Call of the Weird,"This book is little more than a rehash of a film produced by the author some 10 years earlier, as a BBC documentary. The people revisited by the author are more sad than weird, and it became apparent that the author has been unable to move beyond what he views as his ""great"" triumph. The only thing weird that called to me, was the Bush Bashing that he manages to work into every storyline in an odd and forced fashion. My advice is to wait for this book at your nearest garage sale for 50 cents..."
5,Betsy Ross,"This book is very informational. I did not know of her background, only that she was responsible for making our country's flag. I think that children would be surprised, just as I was, to learn of her history."
3,Wrong color.,"So I ordered this for a Halloween costume I was putting together and in the picture it shows a black visor but when I got it, it was grey. Now I have to buy black paint to paint over it. That would be my only complaint."
4,Does its job,"I use this a lot at the lathe, but also for odd jobs around the shop... much easier to slip on and off than goggles - though obviously there are times when goggles are better, such as when you're creating a lot of dust. For what it is, I think it's a pretty good product."
3,Great Halloween Costume Addition,This fit the role perfectly for my Dexter costume. I sprayed the mask with fake blood and it looked perfect.
5,Not foggy,Thought it was foggy. But it was just a removable film :) Great product. Fits perfectly over respirator. Very nicely done. Thanks!
5,great gift !!!!!,i like the fragrance .. its a good gift . so i just going to say stuff now cuase i have to put more words ..
4,"Definitely not 'live""","This disc has been mismarked as ""live"". It is actually a studio date, fairly well-recorded by a small Italian label and licensed to OJC. The pick-up band of local musicians does a good job on the standards despite never having played before with Chet. Of course, they're playing in the by-then international language of hard bop. Conservative, bright, snappy, mid and up-tempo for the most part... in short, right down the middle for someone just getting into Chet or even jazz. I think the reason so many especially like this disc is that there are no vocals on it (a shame, really... I love to hear Chet sing)."
1,stopped playing music,"I bought three of these for my own child and family members. After ONE week with NO rough play - just normal use - two of the boxes stopped playing music. The jack still pops out of the box, but there is no music at all. Very VERY dissappointing because my little 2 yr old really liked it at first. I plan to return them if possible. I will write another review about the return process for these faulty toys."
3,A Perfect Union: Dolley Madison and the Creation of the American Nation,"This is a comprehensive biography of Dolley Madison and her role in James Madison's presidency. It was all right, but far too detailed for a biography on someone who was not a substantial contributor to American History. There were endless descriptions of the type of furniture used in the rooms, etc. which got a bit tedious. It was as though someone wrote a 1000 page biography of Jacqueline Kennedy and her role in JFK's administration; this would suffer from the same problems. The book needed good editing and abridgement, in its present form it is just too detailed."
4,Surprisingly stunning.,"I was rather skeptical about this one but the album is captivating. There is an interesting mix between soulful singing (Chan has one of those can't miss voices) and simple arrangements. Basically, Chan's voice stands out from the simple, almost banal, arrangements.The highlights are: of course, the infamous version of 'satisfaction' (which by the way offers an interesting indie-rock take on Mick's swaggering lyrics), 'Naked if I want to,' and Dylan's 'Paths of Victory.' The versions here make up for the atrocious 'Moonshiner' from 'Moon Pix.'It's not feel-good music. Rather, the tone is sombre, moody, almost like being half-drunk late night at the bar."
4,Revlon is Great,"I have been wearing Revlon lipstick for 25 years. talk about loyal, but when you find something that works you stick with it. The color stays on for a while."
2,lipstick,"It was not dark enough. I have been wearying black berry and black orchard for a very long time, two of my favorite lipsticks. I found that it was not dark enough. I just so happen to go into a five dollars store, someplace I don't generally go and they just so happen to have the perfect color, five left, and I bought all five. I never wore the lipstick I purchase from you again after I found the one I really wanted."
5,"Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick, Rum Raisin, 0.15 Ounce","I love this color, complimentary to my skin tone and most of clothing I wear. Revlon works well for me. Color lasts and keeps my lips moist."
3,Not for those with pigmented lips...,"Demure is a really beautiful lipstick. The color is very complimentary and something that I really wanted to like.I have pigmented, naturally rosy lips and unfortunately, Demure just doesn't show up all that well. It is barely noticeable.The formula sits nice on my lips, but I would be careful to moisturize first or else it will be drying.Although Demure is advertised as a creme, I found it to have the slightest bit of shimmer to it.I don't know how this shows up on lighter lips, but for those with darker pigmentation, Demure doesn't have enough pigmentation to be truly noticeable."
2,Do not order the 16 x 20 frame,I ordered two of this frame; an 11 x 14 and a 16 x 20. They arrived quickly but the 16 x 20 frame's glass was broken. They sent a replacement and that was broken as well! No issues with the 11 x 14 frame at all. The packaging was poor. The wood is good quality and the frame does not look cheap. Wish it would have arrived in one piece!
3,Not recommended,"Well, it basically does what it sets out to do (i.e. cover the ipod). However it is just a tad to big for the 5th gen ipod 30 G so as a result it slides around once enclosed. That, in my opinion, will simply not do. I definately feel as if I wasted my money buying it and I am now looking for a different case (hopefully one that FITS)."
1,An Ad for his other books!,"I agree with the other eviewr... this i nothing more than an ad for the more ""advanced books"" the author sells. Save your money. This is garbage."
2,Extreme 'Basics',"This is an extremely limited overview of my favorite casino game, Video Poker. This book will teach you how to lose a little bit less money, but it is a serious misnomer to call it ""Winning Video Poker.""If you followed all of the advice in this book to the letter, your odds of winning would be about the same as rolling on pure luck.The information is dated and if you want a serious or an informative tome on video poker there are dozens of better ones out there."
2,Wish They Hadn't!,"Thelonious Monk played on synthesizers, well what would you expect?This release actually harkens back to a long tradition (at least since 1968) of novelty records rushed out by various studio musicians to capitalize on the sudden boom in ""Moog records"" following the success of ""Switched-On Bach.""And like those records, this one bears not one iota of the musicality of Carlos's 1968 ground-breaker.The synth sounds used are all parodies (quacking duck sounds, growly square waves, all insanely primitive) plus at least half the sounds are not synthesizer at all -- secret agent guitar, banjo, cheap rhythm box, ring-modulated piano and combo organ. Monk's songs are mostly played for laffs, at the level of Rick Dee's ""Disco Duck"" (if you like that sort of thing).To be fair (and hence the second star) this release makes no pretense of being anything other than what it is, a retro cheesy novelty Moog record. The date says 2003... but I'm not sure I believe it."
5,Happy Valley Days!,"If you're a history buff - especially British history - you won't go wrong with this book. It's setting is the home of such notables as Denys Finch-Hatton and Karen Blixen: British East Africa - Kenya - specifically, ""Happy Valley"" between the two world wars. The author, James Fox, does an excellent job in setting the stage and introducing the characters in one of the most fascinating eras of the 20th Century - complete with the wild lifestyles, drugs, plenty of booze and orgies that the Happy Valley crowd were addicted to. Its unofficial leader was, Joss Hay, Lord of Errol, with his wife, Idina who used to host parties while reclining nude in her bathtub before the games began. Hay, a notorious womanizer, was killed in a yet unsolved murder in 1941; according to rumor, Nairobi still talks about it over seventy years later. Highly recommended![...]"
5,A true classic,"A marvel...a must read for anyone interested in the port of New York. I was fortunate to find a copy in a library I will not name for fear it might be stolen. Last time I checked the New York Public Library had a non-circulating copy in a distant branch, but that's not where I found it.This book was written a long time ago, and I'm amazed at the detailed research the author included in his work. Anyway, the author says the rise of the port cannot be attributed to the opening of the Erie Canal. Instead, the relative advantages of the port of New York compared with Boston, and Philadelphia are 1. It's closeness to the open ocean (ships out of Boston had to first clear Cape Cod, and ships out of Philadelphia had to first cross the length of Delaware Bay) 2. Two different approaches to the port...the Narrows and Hell Gate. If the Atlantic were too rough, then a ship could head for Hell Gate and sail the protected waters of Long Island Sound."
3,More politics and culture than economics,"This book attempts to show the Thai economy both before and after the ""blood baht"" of 1997. The book did an adequate commentary on the build up of the social and political structure but did not deliver on the economic side too much. It also gave the consequences of the crash in much the same way. In short the book is good to read if you want to see how the general population lived both before and after crash. If you want an in-depth critical look at the Thai economy and the underlying reasons for the crash as well as the economic ramifications afterwards then this book is not for you."
1,Disappointed,I purchased this book because it said it was a photographic tour -- it's anything but that! I expected pictures of places all along the coast and the entire book is in black & white with hardly any pictures.
5,Too fun to pass up!,"I loved this when I was a kid and still do, it's the only carton I like now. All of the characters are lovable with Buster and Babs on the Huck Finn adventure. They go a long way for only being on a coffee table and Spelberge even mocks one of his earlyer films (""E.T: Extra Terrastrial"") and even super man. Plucky is histerical while riding in back with the escaped convict. And you get the ultimate laughes in the theatre scene. Spelberge is a genious, I hope this comes out on DVD soon."
5,AH childhood,The Tiny Toon Adventures movie is hands down one of the funniest movies ever made. The 1990s had some awesome cartoons and TTA was one of the best. So relive your childhood or share this classic with your kids. 90s kids are growing up but it's wonderful that we can final share the true cartoon masterpieces.
5,I Love It!,"I Love It, Maybe It's No Bad At All, But It's All Good At All, Tiny Toon Adventures are Bringing them Back in the early Nineties aRE All That! I Love It I Love It Man, Thanks For Your Support The Time!"
1,Phone shuts off on its own.,"I got this new battery. When I started using it the phone just shuts off on its own once in a while.I have to power-on the phone again, then it works fine for a few hours.Then same thing happens.Seems like the battery connections are not good."
4,Great place to start!,"I'd bought other books on the subject, but they were all just pics of other people's creations. This book goes a bit further. It not only provides great photos to spark your creativity, but also some very good basic instruction, and semi-step-by-step images of many projects. It also covers good basics on the different types of concrete for varied projects. Though there is room for improvement, I definitely recommend picking this up if you have any interest in doing your own indooor or outdoor concrete projects."
5,Melodic and energetic!,"I've been listening to this CD and ""Scarlet and Other Stories"" for several years now, and I'm still enthralled by her balletic parade of music and voice. This music is a rare gem."
3,Good story about a small town,"Gas, Food, Lodging was a down to earth,at times, touching story of a single parent family. The story contained good solid characters for the daughters, but at times the mother seemed a little bit flighty and unconcernced. As did the divorced father. Good story line about three peoples existence in a small desert town where there isn't much of anything to do but live a small life. Very good scence's containing hispanic boy and first love of daughter and how boy lives with his deaf mother and how daughter's friends view her relationship with this boy. Older daughter is the opposite of younger daughter and is rebellious to a point where she leaves the small town. Divorced mother and father don't seem to be to concerned with the children unless children need a favor or are being disiplined by mother. END"
3,item not as discribed,Tape displayed lines through out first half of movie. Item not as discribed (did not play like new).
5,THERE'S MORE HAPPENING IN THE DESERT THAN WE CAN SEE...,"Three woman share the long and slow days of Laramie, New Mexico. Nora, the mother of Trudi and Shade works hard everyday and tries to find a sense for her life and her daughters'. Trudi looks for a reason to survive in the desert of her hometown and her life and tries to find it in boys. Shade is looking for a movie-like love, and tries to find it in the screen and in her plans to reconstruct her family. The three of them will fight, will cry and will learn hard but important lessons in the heat of the desert. Excelent movie, very well directed, with a good photography and great actresses. Really a beautiful story with a little bit of hope for everyone."
3,Wrong definitions,"The book provides too many examples. Some of them (30%) are useful.The rest are boring. The definition of the Current Transformation matrix is wrong (colums and rows are exchanged) showing that the author has no idea about linear algebra and matrix products.However this is the only book available for me, so I had to learnPS with it."
3,average book,"I found this book to be lacking in details for the advanced shooter who is looking for information on individual rifles and pistols .the author did not go into much detail ,this book would be ok for a beginner who knows nothing about firearms.It was not what I was looking for."
1,No help from this light.,"I read the reviews and only used this light late at night with the all the other lights off, and held it close to the floor. It was no help. It does make dust glow. Maybe it only works on carpets. I really wanted it to work, but after a couple tries I gave up. i would pay 2 or 3 times what i paid if it worked. For my house it didn't. save your money and buy enzyme cleaner."
2,Battery cap broke instantly!,"The product works as expected but the batteries fit so tightly that the cap broke instantly. Seems a lot of people had this problem. I use tape to hold it shut now. I would return it, but being that it's only $7 and the infrequency of use, I decided not to bother."
5,The Sergeant Pepper's of British Blues,"This underappreciated, almost unknown 1968 recording took blues to a previously unimagined level. Melodic, complex songs with depth and occasional wit are played flawlessly by an all star band steeped in jazz, pop and rock influences. Mick Taylor's stunning guitar work earned him a spot on the Rolling Stones soon afterwards. My only possible complaint with the CD version is that the seven songs of the ""Bare Wires Suite"" which filled the entire first side of the original vinyl release are now lumped together for a 23 minute cut one, making cueing or programming them individually impossible."
4,Rediscovered classic,"After Hard Road and the 'beano album', I was originally outraged that Mayall had included 'horns' on this album. I now have 25 Mayall cds in my collection including anything since Walter Trout and Coco Montoya were members. Mayall and Paul Butterfield turned me onto the blues but this album was rejected. It was not until Kazaa came on the scene before I rediscovered this album. It is the album between 'Hard Road' and 'Crusade'. It contains some classic Mayall, Mike Talyor guitar and some wonderful moody tracks with Henry Lowther on violin. I repent, this is a great album, diminished only by the fact that the first track is a suite of tracks that should have been broken into more sizable chunks."
2,Average Book - buy 1 up on wall street instead,"Save yourself some money and buy One Up on Wall Street. Peter Lynch does a better job of explaing investing and using common sense. This OTA book is OK, but why spend the money when you can get a better book cheaper. A lot of this book talks about how his company informs the institutional investor and comes off as add for his company. His methods are good, but most people can not use them to the extent that is necessary."
5,Mesmerizing,"Morgana King's ""I Know How It Feels To Be Lonely"" alone is worth the price of this brilliant CD. This collection possesses an etheral quaility that presents Blues at its quintessential best. Sara Vaughn and Nina Simone also shine like bright and radiant stars."
4,Good text,"Not a leisure read. If you want indepth, academic discussion this is it. Its very dry but covers the topic well."
3,Brother John steals the show,3 1/2Swinging set of competent live bop rarely exceeds traditional expectations but is well recorded enough with instrumental integrity to avoid apathy.
3,An Interesting Collection,"BEK's cartoons have a distinctive yet austere style. He seems to have put more emphasis on the writing than on the drawing. As Bob Mankoff, the cartoon editor of The New Yorker, of which BEK is a frequent contributor, once wrote: ""It's not the ink, it's the think that makes a great cartoon."" All in all, I thought it was an interesting collection."
2,Not Pleasant Tasting,"This is very foul tasting. Mixing it with milk only helps a little, I would not ruin any form of frozen dessert by using this product. Btw, I am not a picky eater but this was too much."
4,Works well,"I have had this product for quite awhile and have only replaced batteries once. It seems to work well and gives me some peace of mind. Our grandchildren stay with us a couple times a month and it gives me a place to store their toothbrushes and feel they are safe to use. Previously, I bought new toothbrushes for them almost every time they stayed over."
3,Not worthy of its subject,"When I saw this book on the shelves, I grabbed it. As the title states, Johnny Cash at Folsom prison is a masterpiece. Unfortunately, this book is anything but. The story, which really requires no elaboration, is marred by writing which is so excruciatingly bad in places that I found myself wincing. Instead of being able to focus on the story, I was irritated by a neverending series of atrocious similes and metaphors. Open the book at random, and they jump out like fleas. Page 25: ""Cash glided through the grim lyric [of Folsom Prison Blues] like a harrow through soft, pebbly earth."" Next page: ""[Cash's 1950's recordings] strutted rock and roll style and ached like cracked dry skin, far scalier than the Nashville Sound that was melting over country music..."" This is unfortunate because the book is, or appears to be, well-researched. If an editor's pen had excised the purple prose, this might have been a good book."
1,Makes Elvis Movies Look Good,"Oy. What a disappointment. So sickeningly sweet, I had my blood sugar checked for diabetes afterwards. Makes Elvis's Fun in Acapulco look like Citizen Kane. Could only have been redeemed if their holiday bus's brakes had failed, sending this lot of saps flying off a cliff.So sunny and light, it could make dark gothic horrors sound healthy and balancing, careful about showing it to your children!Cracking my copy in half felt like I was helping rid the world of a dangerous menace."
5,HAS HEAVEN RUBBED OFF ON ME OR WHAT,"I CANT FIND THE WORDS. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS ALBUM I KNEW PERFECTION HAD BEE ACHIEVED. THE BEE GEES HAVE BEEN PUTING OUT MUSIC FOR YEARS AND I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THEM. THE SONGS ON THIS RECORD DEFINITLY WILL ALWAYS STICK IN MY HEART. NIGHTS ON BRODWAY IS SUCH A FINE TUNE. AND WHAT ABOUT ""FANNY BE TENDER"" MY HEART ALMOST STOPS EVERY TIME I HEAR IT. ALL I CAN SAY IS I THANK GOD EVERY DAY FOR BRINGING ME SUCH A WONDERFUL GIFT TO SHARE WITH OTHERS. IF YOU WANT MY ADVICE. BUY IT. IT MAY BE THAT MISSING PEICE YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR THANK YOU VERRY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!darrell"
5,A great collection from the BG's,"I just recently found a copy of this at the local church sale. At the moment I didn't know it was a hard find. I did know that when I had a vinyl copy in my youth, it blew me away. Going backwards in time it not always a good thing for a pop music lover. In this case, I just couldn't believe how great the Gibbs were at this point in their career. The production is clean, the songs complex, and the harmonies are ones only these three brothers could pull off. The hits from the cd sound wonderful so many years after the fact, and the less famous numbers are simply beautiful. Along with the BG's first, this is my favorite of their albums."
2,decent at best,"I just recieved this cd in the mail. It's ok but far from what I expected from Killing Joke. A lot of their albums have come under fire from fans, such as Democracy and Outside The Gates. I gave this record a few spins and while it certainly has its own style... the boys seem a little lost. Maybe it was the fact Martin Atkins appeared on the album... maybe not. It may be one of those records that grows on you over time but right now, I can definetly say this is my least favorite of KJ's albums."
4,Peter Erskine's first and fine solo album,"This is a fine first solo effort by my favorite overall drummer and one of the if not THE most versatile drummer(s) around, Peter Erskine. For this album he assembled an all-star cast including among others Michael and Randy Brecker, Bob Mintzer, the late Kenny Kirkland and Mike Mainieri. It is not an earthshaking record, but the execution of the well-chosen songs is inspiring and powerful enough power to impress. Peter's distinct and tasteful drumming style is already evident, although on albums to come after this one he would develop it to higher stages. An album closely connected to this one, both as to recording date and sound, and also highly recommended is ""Steps Ahead"" by Steps Ahead, although I am not sure if it is available at the moment. It is a shame that a number of his other recordings are currently out of print, like the excellent ""Transition"" and ""Motion Poet"", both on the Denon label."
3,Not for action,"Poorly made for an ""action"" toy. Tower will not stay connected to base especially when launching vehicle or dropping down elevator. An accidental hit with an elbow sends the whole thing crashing down. 3.5"" action figures barely fit in chairs, vehicle, or elevator.My 5 year-old is a huge fan and has almost every figure and was looking for a toy like this where he could act out the tv shows. We thought it would be great, unfortunately, after 1 1/2 weeks he barely plays with it because it won't stay together and is frustrating. Not worth (...), even as a gift."
5,Great Book,"I really loved this book! It has a great review of the basic theories and trends of Sociology, and 3 practice exams. The first two exams are on the CD, so you can practice similar to the CLEP. The CD had a great explanation section for the questions. It not only went through the correct answer, but also told you why the other questions were wrong. This was very helpful to me because it helped me learn how to group sociological theories together and made it easier to remember which scientists were in which field of study. I also thought it was brief enough to not fill your head with a lot of clutter. I did very well on my test, and this was the only source I used to prepare."
2,Test is easy but this book covers about 50%,"People seem to be rating the CLEP books based on how easy the test is rather than how much the book actually helped. I read this book this morning (only 75 pages of content, the rest is practice exams). I took the exam in the afternoon and got 63/80 (50 is passing). Unfortunately, half of the stuff on the exam is not in the book at all. So my passing score can be attributed more to good testing taking skills and educated guesses rather than the content of this book."
3,Passed the test but...,"Ok, it does have most of the review of Intro to Sociology but I had a new exam that people were talking about on the forums -it basically had a lot of questions about nowadays trends, data analysis of the last 5 years of like birthrate, obama care plan's pros and cons, so i barely passed the exam. I hope the book that came out in November 2012 has some of those answers."
3,Book is written in horrible English,"I used this book and Wikipedia to study and passed the exam with a 70. However, the book is written in a way as to discourage reading, describing simple concepts with unnecessary complicated words and sentences. This is one of the poorest CLEP review I have used so far."
4,Smooth and gentle intro to Wicca and its practices,"I throughly enjoyed this book. Its reads with warmth and charm and it contains many throughly interesting and informative chapters on getting started, moon magick, herbs,oils and incense and spell work to name but a few. All chapters are generous with their subject matter. What I liked about this book is that it approachs the subject from a spiritual if not metaphysical point of view in some areas, its gentle in its approach and it could easily fit into the same theme ""energy vibe"" that comes off book catagories that you would find Scott Cunninghams work. Earthy. The sections of Tarot, Chakras and Qabala are very enlightening. A gem of a book for those just starting out and interested in Wicca. The book cover art is beautiful and will appeal to many to pick it up and give it a look through."
3,Where's the band?,Don Ellis fans (and I know you're out there)love Ellis'intricate time signature work in a big band arrangement best. Ellis' popularity was made and continues on in a big band setting. His intricate time signature work was/is his forte! Where's Live at Fillmore on CD?
5,An extraordinarily expressive & versatile singing voice!,"There are 3 things that make this album exceptional. The first is AB's singing voice: for those who have heard him it's obvious that he has a gift which few can equal. The second: the theme of the 1st half of the cd: a personal spiritual struggle of great tension. The third: Vincent Crane's fantastic Organ work & Carl Palmer's drumming. No guitar here, yet remarkably moving music that fits both the theme & ABs voice. ""Fire"" was/is a huge hit single, but the first 6 tunes are all great. Try Fire Poem or Come & Buy. AB is a very creative, ORIGINAL, & different artist. I say ""buy""!"
4,Crazy Brown,"When Mr. Brown brought his show to Honolulu in the late '60s, only about 400 people showed up. The man generously envited *everyone* present to come down to the front and center section. And then he gave us an *incredible* performance! I've never seen anything like it since. Great music!This is a hugely classic CD. I want to give it 5 stars. Several of the songs *are* 5 stars. Hmmm... Well, it's still one of the essential works that shook the definition of rock when it first appeared. (Like much of the music at the time.) Brown, of course, has an amazing voice. Arthur, my dear...I love you. You made a fine album.Yes, but, the live show was ever better...."
4,Worth it just for Fire,"I first heard Fire on the radio back-to-back with Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire and was hooked ever since. The rest of the album doesn't quite measure up, but it's still interesting and grows on you after a while."
4,Conspiracy,"Worthwhile CD, entertaining and sets the mood I was looking for when purchased. Glad to have added this one to my collection"
2,Erros Abound,"Enthusiastic and entertaining, but alas errors abound. The authoris an astronomer who doesn't really understand fundamental physics. Entire passages seem to be copied from Feynman.And where Icke begins making additions of his own, they frequently -- and I imagine unintenionally -- display his lack of insight into physics. I cannot begin to list the examples here."
5,"Perfecto, inolvidable","Dicen que las primeras impresiones son importantes. ""El Hombre del Traje Gris"" fue el primer album de Joaquin Sabina que escuche. Despues de escucharlo quede marcado, y aunque busque mas material como el que Sabina capturo en este album, y aunque Sabina ha grabado mucha musica increible desde que salio esta produccion en 1988, nunca mas produjo un album entero tan perfecto, tan inolvidable. Desde ""Eva Tomando El Sol"" hasta el ""Rap del Optimista"" su genialidad a nivel de composicion, su sentido del humor impecable y la chispa y sensibilidad en sus letras me capturo por siempre. Son casi dos decadas desde que salio a la venta, y todavia hoy ""Quien Me Ha Robado El Mes de Abril"", ""Una De Romanos"" o ""Los Perros del Amanecer"" se apoderan de mi cada vez que las escucho.""El Hombre del Traje Gris"" es uno de esos pocos albumes que merecen el titulo de clasicos, y como tales, deben tener un lugar especial en toda coleccion musical de rock en español seria."
4,What an eye opener!,"It's the world we live in. Internet, cellphone, cable tv, facebook, work, school, etc. We try and cram so many things into our day thinking we are being productive, yet we are wreaking havoc on our bodies. Read this book and I think you will be fascinated by what you learn, and I think you will enjoy what you do for yourself after reading."
3,NICE OVERNIGHTER,THIS BAG WAS PURCHASED AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. THE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD AND THE COLOR (GARDEN ASH) TURNED OUT TO BE NICER THAN EXPECTED. I THINK THE BEST FEATURE WILL TURN OUT TO BE THE BOTTOM SECTION THAT ALLOWS THE USER TO STUFF DIRTY CLOTHES. GOOD VALUE FOR THE $$.
2,Worse than VHS Quality!,"Most videos on here I am sure hip-hop fans have seen, but the quality is not even up to VHS standards. It is like a dub of a dub or a dub! How this got released I'll never know."
2,I'm disappointed!,"I bought this CD because I love the song ""Spaceship"" and it's alternative rock style. I listened to the rest of the album and thought that it couldn't be the same guy! All of the rest of the songs on the album sound like they were recorded by a 'boy-band'. I will listen to ""spaceship"" over and over...it's only too bad I couldn't return the rest of the album."
4,Profound Ideas,"Baxter's 'Manifold Time' focuses on some truly profound ideas and mind-boggling time scales. Very deep.Yes, the dialogue, plot, and characters are at times a bit thin. Overall the plot and writerly craft pick up during the second half. But the point of 'Manifold Time' is the science and the ideas, and sublime ideas they are. If you are just looking for a dumb, cheap thriller, this is not for you. But anyone who appreciates Carl Sagan or Michio Kaku and the accompanying deep thoughts of astrophysics and the universe should appreciate this book."
3,"Good science, but depressing","Baxter's novel Manifold: Time is a mind-boggling exercise in concrete scientific concepts put to theoretical use. It is interesting, well-written, and intellectually stimulating. But it has rather thinly drawn characters, and the ending, which is perhaps meant to be uplifting, strikes a depressing note.Baxter tells us his story using multiple points of view. Some characters appear once, and others many times. We occasionally feel some emotion for them, but not much, because they rarely seem fully realized. This book is enjoyable if you wish to read about informed concepts (Baxter has a doctorate in aeroengineering research), and it is successful enough to have been nominated for the 2000 Arthur C. Clark Award. But don't read it for a human story, unless you're interested in one on the galactic scale."
1,A very painful read,"I love books of all types (especially SciFi) but this book was very painful to read and after halfway through the book I finally had to put the book down. Perhaps I just didn't get it, but even after getting through half the book I still ""didn't get it"" and wasn't sure what the story was supposed to be about.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."
5,Three Cheers for Sheena 5,"None of the reviewers (5 stars) has mentioned Sheena 5. Stephen Baxter created one of the most unique science fiction characters ever published: Sheena 5, the intelligent squid. Yes, fellow Sci Fi readers, see character development for an inhuman character, a squid. Experience the thoughts and emotions of a squid! This is a great book of imaginative fiction with a most memorable character. This is a fabulous story. Sheena happens to be one of my favorite parts of this story."
3,An opportunity missed,There is almost nothing available concerning the US Federal Bureau of Prisons (the BOP)This writer was given wide access and considerable assistance in obtaining info re the BOP by the BOP..The book is a pedestrian book by committee.As a faculty member she had available a number of students to do the grunt work of assembling the info for the book and she acknowledgesthat that is what she did.On the positive side it has photos and a thumbnail write up on about 98% of the BOP prisons and other faciliies.Beyond that the effort is pitiful.Nothing about the personnel and policies of the BOP and so little as to be useless about such serious aspects as the siting and design of new facilities.The author is a career faculty type and her book reflects the worst aspects of writing to pad out a resume.A worthwhile book on this major government agency is waiting to be written
4,movie review,"I was eager to get this video ordered the day Whitney Houston died because I remembered it as a really fine movie, fine performances by all, esp. Kevin Costner. However, there were a couple of sequences referred to but not in the movie...the ""voodo doll"" and the ""white powder"" incident. Strange.We enjoyed the movie, but wondered what happened to these two sequences. Thank you for getting it to us quickly."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this to watch in HD on my new 43"" plasma TV. Half way through the movie it stopped playing. I could not finish watching. Very dissappointing."
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Cheesy plot + terrible acting = The worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not surprised it garnered the Razzie Award for the worst picture of the year. On the other hand, the music is awesome."
5,good movie;great music!,i SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN IT ORIGINALLY WAS RELEASED. The story is very good and of course the music is wonderful. I enjoyed watching it again. It was especially a treat to hear the music.The acting was very well done also. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston did a fine job.
4,A good film!,This is a good film with an ok plot. But if you dont like any of the acotrs and dont like mind games dont get this. But on the hole it has some great acting (on Gary Kemps parts) so if you are a fan of any of the actors get it.
3,good movie,My dad has a lot of VHS tapes and wanted them on DVD..this was his first choice..glad I could find it here for him...
3,New Twists are Intriguing,"This book was interesting in the fact that it was different than other Holmes books. It has some different approaches and moves into some different areas where other Holmes books don't attempt (such as the last story). This is supposedly the author's first book and it's not bad in that regard. I read some of the other reviews and noticed that the ""purest"" of the Holmes society have once again tried to trash anyone who tries to write out of the original canon. Shame on them. There are some editing problems in the book, but I have found that these are somewhat common from the specific publisher."
3,Decent for First Book,"This book was fairly good. I think that the author had some difficulty with the British phrasing/grammer, which explains some of the awkward sentence structure. Conan-Doyle wrote in a very baroque style and some authors have difficulty following it, especially if they are not British. I liked a couple of the stories, the others could have used more detail."
2,What WAS the author thinking?,"The first story bored The Raven beyond belief! I almost tossed the book (I gotta learn not to buy every book with Sherlock Holmes in the title!) but I forced myself to finish. It's bloody sure Dilisio is not British, nor has he read much British fact or fiction. In fact, he blew it badly. Some stories amused The Raven, so two stars. The only worse pastiche is Michael Dibdin's The Last Sherlock Holmes Story, which indeed should be the last one HE writes. Ditto for this book and dreary Dilisio. Quoth the Raven..."
4,Pond Life- Great Variety,I am very pleased with the variety of plants and animals identified in this book. Lots of very useful information. Nice size for carrying in a bag or even a pocket.
3,Prada Princess,"This is a decent movie. It's characters are well-played, but, unfortunately, you pretty much know exactly what is going to happen throughout the show. No big, thrilling movie for me, but there's a good lesson about keeping your values intact even when you don't want to."
5,My wifes second favorite movie.,"Behind Pretty Woman this is my wifes favorite movie. I even liked it, but don't tell anyone."
4,Fashionably Engaging,"Cute story about a young college graduate seeking to become a journalist and takes a job working for a fashion magazine under Miranda Priestly, the demanding high-powered executive whose connections extend across the globe.Although the movie center's wound Anne Hathaway's character, Meryl Streep steals the show. Her represntation of the dragon lady boss was dead on! Not the high-octane-greedy-loud-mouthed CEO so typical of Hollywood films, but a very realistic view of Bosses at the top and the manner in which their subordinates react to meet their demands. She's controlled, soft spoken, unyielding and very firm...and she knows the business better than anyone else. It's funny to watch people scramble to meet her impossible demands.Amazing clothes! I have a new appreciation for the fashion industry. I didn't realize so much went into it. Enjoyable chick flick with amazing couture."
2,Ordinary chick flick,"I'm surprised this got such good ratings here. The story line is thin. A young girl comes to Manhattan and gets a job as an assistant to a bitchy magazine mogul. Nothing much happens, it's like a one-joke comedy, wears thin with the similar scenes becoming redundant. Meryl Streep does her best to save it but it's just not a good story and nothing much happens. Add a star if you like chick flicks or love Streep in any role."
1,No download,Never was able to down load movie. Called the help desk and talked to someone that wasn't much help. Was able to down load another movie so I know my computer works.
2,haven't we seen this before ?,"Ok way to spend a couple of hours, but hey, didn't I see something oh so similar called ""Working Girl"" starring Melanie Griffith, Sigorney Weaver, and Harrison Ford ? That one was I think a more memorable 'edition'. A few differences, but similar new girl-underdog-to slave driver boss senario."
2,The Devil wore Prada.,A shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values... A waste of time.
2,What the devil was all the hype,We didn't like this movie at all. While Meryle Streep did a good job (reason for 2 stars instead of 1) this movie must have been targeted to the 19 - 21 year old female market. Even my son's girlfriend was bored by it.
5,On-line movie purchase,Both the video and sound quality were excellent. I highly recommend movie purchases from Amazon.com - they are always top quality.
3,Chick Flick,"It's a good movie, kinda wants you needing to know more? Maybe you should get the book, it's a lot better than the movie."
3,ONCE WAS ENOUGH FOR ME,"I'M A 'PLAIN JANE' IN HER MID-FIFTIES, SO THERE WAS NO PULL FOR ME TO SEE THIS AGAIN & AGAIN. THE WORLD OF A FASHION DIVA JUST DIDN'T HAVE MUCH APPEAL FOR ME. HOWEVER, MY TWENTY-SOMETHING FRIEND FROM WV PUT THIS AT THE TOP OF HER CHRISTMAS LIST."
3,The Devil is naked and Jesus has a cold,"so so film, if you like Streep's character acting like a pain in the arse with Hathaway at her beck and call. Pretty lame ending because seriously for her to...well let me just say that her boyfriend in the movie was a schmuck who did not deserve a girl like that in the first place. Hey writers of this movie, do not paint a guy to be a loser but then try to make him out to be some nice guy with some interest in stuff, guys who sit around eating pizza all day and not giving a crap about the ladies who love them really are losers!"
3,Engaging!,"Whilst the book was much better, the film was good although the sound quality could have been better. Meryl Streep as usual gave a good job, ditto Anne Hathaway."
4,Daughter loved it,I got this for my daughter. She saw it on TV and wanted to have the movie. She likes the lessons she found in the movie.
5,"Meryl Streep, you rock!!","I loved her in this movie, and couldn't wait to see what she would do next. Top that with Anne H. and all those beautiful clothes, the skinny attitudes of the models, and it was a great movie!!Atruly modern version of truly modern women!! S. Tucci is awesome in anything he does, loved this movie!!"
5,Love this movie,I originally bought this movie because Meryl Streep is in it. I also like the fact that Anne Hathaway was in it. I think the storyline is excellent and anyone would love this movie.
2,A Piece O' Postmodern Junk!,"I can summarize what this movie truly represents in this quote by a comedian.""Ex-girlfriends are like 'ok' movies. They were alright at the time but I really wouldn't want to see it again. Especially if the movie was a bitch!""-Demetri Martin-buy his cd now:These Are Jokes"
2,Why would Meryl Streep be in this movie????,"I hoped I would never have to endure an experience as boring as reading ""The Devil Wears Prada."" (And I didn't finish it).Then I saw the movie. (I still didn't totally finish it).Predictable, cliche-ridden, and totally banal. The only question I have is the one I posed in my title: ""Why would Meryl Streep be in this movie"" and, further, in this BAD a movie?I only wonder why I've never published a book, then had a movie made. Because this book was so lame, and the movie, so much lamer, that I know I've missed a great secret that's lying out there.Meryl Streep is the ONLY reason to watch this movie. And, sadly, even she isn't enough to make it worthwhile.Watch an old Woody Allen movie. Much more entertaining."
4,Dark and moody.,"This is the 7th in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. It starts off in the year 1887 with an interesting premise, and it moves steadily toward an exciting finish. The character of Thomas is more likable than last time, and his wife Charlotte, who doesn't have much to do in the first part of the book, becomes very active later, as does her sister Emily. And there are characters brought back from previous books. Along the way, because of Charlotte's unusual social circumstances and Thomas's profession, we learn some fascinating insights into the class system of that time and place.The author is consistent in her ability to create a sense of place and character. In DEATH IN THE DEVIL'S ACRE the atmosphere is dark and moody, with a very unpleasant topic. But the book is well done and adds to the series."
2,Really outdated,"Many of the previous reviews are really old (or have nothing to do with the actual text of the book). So much has changed, for example, digital photography is the norm, not the new technology. Many new tools and techniques have been introduced to the scrapbook world since 2004. I would love to see an updated version come out."
3,Scrapbooking for dummies,"not exactly what it appeared to be, Thought it would be in colourotherwise ok"
5,Must read,"Heartbreaking look at the darker side of what's going on in our country. I helped rash a foster son who suffered the milder form of this tragic man made infliction. Anyone who wants to understand the real side effect of our welfare systems, the inner city and the Native communities should read and pay heed."
2,Very crude and superficial Lincoln film,"This is an episodic film that touches on important moments in Lincoln's life. The acting is stilted, script very disappointing (especially since written by Stephen Vincent Benet). Sound is iffy (at times the film inexplicably goes silent, even when actors are moving their lips. Overall, I would not recommend this film."
3,AVERAGE DISCO SOUNDTRACK,"If you've seen the movie, you'll relate to these songs. If not, it is far from the best that the disco era had to offer. The only big names here are Diana Ross, Donna Summer, The Commodores, Thelma Houston and, to a lesser extent, Santa Esmeralda. Diana's ""Lovin', Livin' and Givin'"" was a small hit back then, as was Paul Jabara's ""Trapped In a Stairway"" and the title track by Love and Kisses. Of course, Donna had a huge hit with ""Last Dance"" and her version of ""Je T'aime (Moi Non Plus)"" is a superb interpretation of the Gainsborough/Birkin classic. That's about it! TGIF never had the appeal of Saturday Night Fever. It's worthy as a period piece but to get real disco classics the numerous compilations on the market are a better bet."
5,great to have as a backup,"I appreciate how these survival essentials are merged (whistle/knife/firestarter). Try holding all the items separately that this tool integrates. Small enough to be a solid backup blade for survival packs, not big enough to be my main blade. Opens/closes easily but firmly, fits in my hand well. Firestarting takes some real effort because of the short mag rod, but is reassuring to me to have as a backup. I wrapped hemp wick (about 8"" worth) around the mag rod. The holder appears water tight, it has rubber gasket, with just enough room for a tiny amount of combustible material (hence the wick). I considered it reliable enough to buy again - after losing my first one. Look for the one that has the glow lanyard, nice little extra."
4,"Excellent quality, but food does stick easily","I've used my Sizzle-Q a number of times now, and it is well built, made of very thick material, and is most likely indestructable. It has been used several times to cook bacon and other items, and does so quite well. The only downside is that since it is not coated (and it shouldn't be given the temperatures it is subjected to), so food does stick unless you spray the surface first. Sometimes food sticks regardless of spraying or not.One other thing of note. As of the writing of this review, the Amazon description says it's made in America, but the manufacturer's site, [...]"
4,Harry Hoyle's Giant Jumping Bean,"Harry Hoyle collected all sorts of things. If it could be kept in a room, he had it. In fact, he lived in a house with 72 rooms, each filled with a different collection. Harry had everything from string and rocks, to telephones and ice cream. Harry and his cat, Max, would go to a different room each day, but never to the room where the giant jumping bean was kept. The jumping bean was very dangerous and had to be locked in at all times. Then one day, Harry realized that the housed was full. He had no place to put his new collection of old doorknobs. Harry finally decides that the jumping bean must go, even if it means taking it out of the house himself. Will Harry's plan work?This fun-filled story is easy to read and follow along with. The humorous personality of Harry and the exasperated attitude of his cat, Max, make the comical duo very likable. Although the idea of a giant jumping bean is a little silly, I think it is a great topic for a children's story."
3,Hit-and-miss and keep on drivin'!,"Good old Hank: they keep on coming and even if the new ones are increasingly a hit-and-miss affair it's still worth ploughing through. Just when you almost nod off a thought, a paradox, an acerbic aside jolts you back to life and you keep on reading until your eye lids get heavy and you at last fall asleep.If there were no Buk he should have been invented. Still a strong anti-dote to the virulent poisons of the ""politically correct"" Suburban Americana."
1,I think it was mislabeled.,"I put this salve on my tattoo and it burned so badly I broke into tears. I contacted the manufacturer, and they said it was probably mislabeled. I believe it should come in a black tube, but mine was white. I hope this was an isolated incident."
4,A Pioneer Author of the Macabre,"Most of the other reviews here rightly criticizethe syrupy romance of Chambers and the thincharacter development in this book. They alsoentirely miss the point. This book was publishedin 1895, and between Poe and Ambrose Bierce theliterature of fantasy and the macabre had notdeveloped greatly. This book should simply beenjoyed for what it is -- a flawed book withsome rather sinister and chilling stories.A better purchase would be ""The King In Yellow AndOther Stories,"" which collect this and other works."
4,"I thought it would be ""dated""","I read this novel as an adolescent when it first came out and was prepared to find it dated because I remembered, vaguely, that it was about open relationships and all sorts of hippie stuff that was so prevelant at the time.How a novel that is so ensconced in a time and place can still sound relevant is remarkable. If you were to change some of the details--hairstyles, labels, even the television programs--you could transplant these characters into the present without compromising the characters or their experiences.I reread it and found myself laughing and cringing. If everything old is new again then this book definitely proves the point. For better or worse, maybe we have not come as far as we had thought."
5,Soap Opera Lover's,This is such a great book. Spiral bound and easy to read and I am a big time daytime soap fan so when I came across this it is where I live I took it tongue in cheek but fell in love with it. I have read it many times and if you are a Soap Opera Lover then this book is for you.
5,Fash Shipment!,I received the product 2 days after ordering it. It was in perfect condition and is a phonenominal book to purchase if attempting to persue personal training as a profession. Very easy and educational for someone who needs a hand getting started.
4,Good introduction to subject,"Interesting introduction to the Palestinians own perceptions of their occupation and diaspora. Also a good window into a literary tradition very different from that of the West - and therefore it can sometimes be hard for Western readers to fully understand some of the cultural and literary allusions. Subjects are often approached very indirectly. Unsurprisingly, stories are bleak, raw and sad at times. They're also very personal, and a good counter-balance to the usually very politicized accounts of the situation in the media."
3,3.5 Stars for The Clearing,"I'm not too familiar with Craig Armstrong. I know what movies he's scored, and I own the occasional track from his music, but I don't own too many albums of his. The Clearing is a darn good movie that opened with little fanfare, as did the score. This score is better than you'd think. True, a lot of it is background music. There are some tracks which could be excluded from this almost hour long album to make it tighter and more attention grabbing. But if you're a fan of electronic suspense scores that are underscored with tragic strings and heartbreaking pianos, then this CD is for you. It doesn't jump out at you, but gradually lets you know of it's presence. Besides, if nothing else, you should get it for the I Have Everything I Need track, which is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.cheersKZ"
1,Don't waste your money!!,The idea is great and the pictures make it look like the ideal toy...which is why I spent the $70. But I can't get the bars together to make the arches and my daughter hasn't spent a minute using this $70 toy.Cathi
1,NOT STURDY!,"This tube just isn't safe to turn your back on! Because the sides give, a baby's face could get trapped. It's a pain to inflate and the toys fall over. It just doesn't offer long-term use. I bought The Sitting Square and love it much better. It taught my daughter how to sit up and crawl and offered a safe nest-like area for her to play in. My older children love it too! They read in it and watch videos!"
2,not as good as expected,"It looks to be well made but I found it difficult to keep properly aligned.All dowel jigs I have used are to some degree, problematic.The drill bit did not cut well either.It does not inspire confidence."
1,Incredibly Flawed Product,"Good luck using this garbage. How do you mass produce a dowel jig with it's guides manufactured off center and unusable? I'd like to see what the General Tools T Square looks like. No inch would be the same length. Pointless. It would have been an useful product had they otherwise paid a little attention to this one, critical feature. Maybe it got botched in the manufacturing, who knows. Useless. Save yourself some time and look elsewhere. This thing just cost me a day or two."
2,All in all a very decent book,"This book is not bad. It is not anything like Hit & Run Trading, but it is a good start."
1,5 STARS?!!!!!!,"I read the book. If you know about trading, you can tell that Ms. Turner does not trade!.( As a matter of fact I KNOW she is not trading, because she doesn't know how!!!) I wounder if she is the one giving her book 5 star reviews!. That could be a full time job!!"
3,"great for animation, posing, and decoration, but not very durable","I recently purchased a Stikfa set because i had heard they were very good for animating. I had been looking for an inexpensive armature that was pretty durable and fun along the way.They worked great for the first few weeks and looked realistic in most poses, but the plastic was not very high quality. after a while the joint became wobbly, and didn't hold up for the work. Often the joints would break from having a little too much pressure.I decided to get another set because of this, and after the first few days (before any animating had been done) all of the figures feet snapped in two.Overall, I thought stikfas were good products for me, and worked well while they did, but the overall durability was disappointing"
5,Fantastic!,Sean Bean plays Richard Sharpe - a poor common soldier raised from the ranks for saving Wellington's life. In this movie he risks all for honor and to secure a promotion. If you enjoy old fashioned adventure then you will love Sharpe's Eagle.
5,MATT DAMON WAS BORN TO BE JASON BORNE,"The Bourne SupremacyThe Borne Supremacy takes over where the Bourne Identity left off. Jason Borne played by Matt Damon is still searching for his true identity and why someone is out to kill him. One thing leads to another and Jason finds himself in Berlin. A truly good action adventure. I wonder if it was an accident that Robert Ludlum chose a name with the same initials as Fleming's James Bond?Highly recommended for Ludlum fans and for fans of high adventure.Gunner October, 2007"
4,Third Damon/Bourne Movie will make the killing machine human,"....*more* human that is. I predict this because here we see little tidbits of info--revelation of Jason Bourne's real name, Jason's apology to the Russian gal for offing her parents, his relying on the by the book female honcho played by Joan Allen--that there may be a movie franchise in the making. This film is one you've gotta keep your eyes open for or you'll miss something...you can't doze for a second, because you'll miss him getting to, say, Berlin, por exemple (whaaat? how'd he get there?), to say nothing of the real-time car chases. (The one that is in India culminates in a manner which will blow your mind....). Matt has found a movie character that many will identify him as...ala Connery as Bond or Ford as Indy Jones."
3,"""BORING""","""The Bourne Supremacy"" is definitly not as good as the first one. Who ever watches this film will go to sleep. I like the film, I like the fact that I get to more about Bourne than I wanted to. But this is just a BORING FILM. I'm kinda dissapointed, but I still recommend it. I hope the third installment is better."
5,one great action movie,"Nicely made and well acted. The action is furious, and believable (well semi believable, but hey it's a movie!). Highly recommend this to action movie buffs."
2,Shaking Camera,"Except for the terrible shaking camera, this was a good movie with lots of action and a good story line. I had to look away on some scenes to keep from getting sick due to all the camera motion."
5,Bourne Again,Jason Bourne leaves you on the edge of your seat again as he continues to unravel the mystery of his past. A better investment for your dollar than the latest 007 drivel.
3,They were done shooting their wad with the first one,"More of the same. The car chases - this time in Goa & Moscow feel like the rehashes that they are. This sequel comes across as very unoriginal and what's with that long coat? Doesn't a guy trained to kill & evade capture not know to change his identity once in while to throw people off his trail?This one was a huge disappointment but still gets 3 stars for all the fireworks. Worth watching once mainly to see how they followed up on the masterful ""Bourne Identity."""
4,Second in a trilogy,The second movie of the Jason Bourne Trilogy is also the second best of the three.Action packed and edge of your seat.If you like the first one you will like this one also.
4,Great Movie,This is part of one of our favorite trilogies. It has very strong characters and great acting. The fight scenes are awesome!
4,Bourne Supremacy review,This is one of my favorites. My son and I love to watch the Bourne series when we have the opportunity. Have not seen Legacy.
1,Horrible Plot Hole,"Hollywood is known for taking a book and completely screwing up the plot, and this movie continues that tradition. Within the first 10 minutes the plot hole upon which the rest of the movie is based is revealed: Jason Bourne supposedly leaves his fingerprint at the scene of an assassination. Wow!In the first movie Conklin tells Bourne that he is a ""30 million dollar weapon."" So, Jason Bourne is a highly trained assassin who comes out of hiding to assassinate two people, but conveniently leaves behind a pristine fingerprint; and no one in the briefing room at the FBI could realize how incredulous this seemed? I mean the first thing an assassin learns in Assassination 101 is wear gloves. Again, wow."
3,Ripoff,"This film is a clone of Three Days of the Condor, the Robert Redford classic. Not a bad film but a work of plagiarism if ever I saw it."
2,I really wasn't impressed.,There are better movies out there. This follows the standard Hollywood formula. Predictable the entire way through.
2,Everlasting Treat for Dogs,"not so great , my dog was finished the treat in no time did not last at all, sorry about this reveiw but do not like this product"
3,Yummy but pricey...,"If the treat would stay in the toy for awhile it would be fine (which it would the first couple times I used the toy) but the toy must stretch a bit or something because now my pup can get them right out and it's gone chomp, chomp. So after I use these up I'll probably not buy them anymore and just let him get the little treats out of the middle of his toy."
1,A Real Disappointment,"As a fan of Crowded House, Neil Finn, and Tim Finn, I bought this album with high expectations. But after one listen, I came to the conclusion that this CD will probably rank as one of the worst of the year. A real mess.Finn tries for a harder rock sound and in doing so sacrifices all of the tunefulness of his previous releases.This, in itself, would be OK, but the product is just a disaster. It sounds like something that was banged out in one afternoon.Perhaps Finn should bring back producers like Mitchell Froom or Tchade Blake if this is what he sounds like without their help."
4,Fat Tuesday Tradition,"On Fat Tuesday, the 'Indians' of New Orleans swagger & sway their way through the streets in search of rival gangs to 'serve' in a ritual which dates back to the call & response chants used by nomadic West African societies.Their brightly-colored feathers & plumes, bejeweled with elaborate beadwork are inspired by the garments worn during ceremonies & by the warriors & royalty of the 19th Century Plains Indians.Heavily laden with percussion (bells, congas, drums, bass), ""Here Comes the Indians"" is a Caribbean broth seasoned with a touch of reggae, simmering with jubilant vocals, mixed while still hot with organ & guitar, then splashed with brass (trumpet) and finally plated with a side of winds (flute & sax).The CD starts with a boom & ends with a version of ""Redemption Song,"" performed with a tenderness that come only come from the heart.No collection of Mardi Gras music is complete without the spice of this unique musical style."
4,Land,"Land being a 2 disc compilation of Patti Smith and was released 2002 on Arista Records. I had not listened to Patti Smith prior to picking this compilation up at my local library. The sound is a mix of rock, protopunk and punk rock with very provocative lyrics. The booklet contains a letter written by Clive Davis and liner-notes by Patti Smith herself. The booklet also contains several photographs of Patti Smith and her band. I had heard the song ""Because of the night"" before listening to this compilation but I had no idea that Patti Smith had written as a collaboration with Bruce Springsteen. Allmusic and Rollin Stone both the album high marks in their reviews. 4/5."
4,A great upgrade.,"This is the starting point for the wiring system clean up project for one of the show trucks. This made it simple to clean up 3 different wiring systems into one new integrated and simple to troubleshoot system. It also dressed up the battery, a notoriously ugly part."
3,Audio,"There is done right, then there is over done. The allen screws for the wire hook up is done right. The allen screw for the actual terminal screw is over done, a bolt would be easier to get tightened down, rather than trying to contort an allen wrench against battery to tighten it."
2,Eh,"Had great potential but the ending fell flat. Couple of creepy parts, but overall predictable and NOT scary. Skip it!"
1,You'd be better off volunteering for 2 hours of tasering,"I bought this movie with high hopes. The cover makes it look compelling, right? No. Not compelling at all. Absolute garbage. It starts out the first few minutes trying to hook you and seeming to do so not too badly. Then when they try to have their first event, I could tell I wasted my money. The only thing this movie did besides making me want to give the people who made this their last rites, was to realize what a hoax some of exorcism is. But if you look at some of the good reviews and see who made them, that should be a light bulb going off in your head... (I figured this out after the fact) I am off to use my copy for batting practice until I am lucky enough to find any of the actors, directors, or writers."
2,GOOD IDEA ...HORRIBLY EXCECUTED...,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA BE SCARY... I FIND THE DEMON POSSESSED GENRE OF HORROR FILMS TO THE MOST FRIGHTENING . SO I WAS A BIT NERVOUS TO SEE THIS MOVIE...I'M ANNOYED NOW.I CAN'T BELIEVE I EXPENDED ALL THAT ENERGY BEING AFRAID OF THIS PINHEAD OF A MOVIE. I WILL SAY THIS. IF THE ACTUAL EXORCISM WAS EVEN REMOTELY SCARY ,THIS MIGHT HAVE BE A VERY CLEVER FILM. BUT IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE TO BEING SCARY."
1,I'd give it 3 stars if not for the ending.,"It could have been an interesting approach at an old story. However, there was far too much time spent on the fake exorcism but I guess that really was the whole purpose. The biggest problem is the ending. It ruins the few positive aspects that do exist."
1,Garbage,"This movie is not frightening. It is rather nasty garbage. A horror tale, book or movie, should induce suspense. It should, if good enough, involve the emotions as well as the interest of the reader/viewer. This one does neither. It only brings the knowledge that one has wasted one's time."
1,The dead cat did it,I had to stop watching it at that point where Nell kills the cat. I hate it when they kill pets in movies. That part made my veterinarian sister cry and shake because it disturbed her so much. We returned this movie after that and watched Inception.
1,=p,thank u for the good service fast delivery but... this movie SUCKED lmaoo but thank u for the great service! =]
2,Dropped the ball,"Would have easily been a solid 4 stars were it not for the ending. That's too bad. Loved the idea of revealing the scam which is religion - (hate me, don't care. That's my opinion. Deal with it.) But then they dropped the ball at the end. Watch it and you'll enjoy the first 80%. Then they ask us to forget all that which we just watched and jump on board with the ""voodoo"" believers. Really? That's how you lose both audiences. You never gain the ""paranormal"" believers by doing a ""reveal all"" story and then you lose the logicians in the last 20 minutes.I give you credit for trying...2.5 stars for failing."
2,"Yes, I do hope this will be the last film of exorcism","Warning: SPOILERS AHEAD.- The only good things about this film are Patrick Fabian's acting, the twist at the end and the surprise ending.- There's no suspense, horror or climax at all.Patrick Fabian's engaging acting kept me interested for two-third of the movie even though there was very little material for him to play. Then it became boring when it turned out to be another story of Satanism worshipping. It also showed that a beast or a monster or a devil might have been born by the girl. I said ""might"" because that moment was just shown in seconds. It's too short to see things clearly. The movie ended when it looked like all the film crew had been killed or some of them had escaped with their lives.In the end, I think it is more annoying than entertaining."
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars,What a horrible rip off of the Blair Witch Project; which was another waste of film. This movie dragged and dragged and dragged. I don't know how I sat through it. Pathetic writing and acting. Barely any suspense. Huge disappointment. Don't waste your time with this film.
2,"Wow, what movie did everyone else see?","I rented this because I usually like this genre of movie, and I read a bunch of reviews that really raved about the creativity and good acting. I did not have extremely high expectations, but even so, I was disappointed. The first 20 minutes or so seemed ridiculous to me, like a really bad parody of an ""exorcist"" movie. Within the first few minutes of the film, I had already predicted the ""surprise"" ending. Disappointing, and I can't believe they have come out with a second ""last exorcism"" movie. What, is the next one called ""The NEXT Last Exorcism""? Or maybe the first should have been called ""The Penultimate Exorcism"" or ""The Next-To-Last Exorcism"" instead?"
4,I thought it was pretty good!!!!,"Not sure why so many dislikes, but I thought is was a good movie and I am a huge horror movie fan. Yeah, similar to all the other exorcism type of movies, but this had a twist you should enjoy!"
4,highly entertaining,For a b movie this was great!! It kept us guessing for quite some time as to the real reason for the behavior of the girl. Glad we watched it. Very much an edge of the seat view.
3,"""Faux documentary""","I was not looking for a lot out of this movie, and I was not disappointed. The genre is getting WAY overused, and the actors are making it worse, unfortunately. If you can suspend disbelief, and just watch it for what it is, it's a decent movie. Had it been better acted and not so clunky, it could have been better and scarier."
2,It reminded me of Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity,"Neither of which I found credible, scary or convincing. Alot of hype about NOTHING. Don't waste your money - I am glad I decided to WATCH it on Amazon and not purchase the video."
3,I hope to find a better book than this,"There were some helpful things in this book, but I had a hard time with the way the author uses anger as a verb. It made it rather awkward and uncomfortable to read. It did have some ideas that are helpful towards anger management, but I am going to try to find a book that is more up to date. I didn't like the way the author seemed rather full of himself at times, even using his own quotes! For a book published in 2000 it seems rather out of date. I expected a lot more. I was looking for a book to help me learn to manage my anger, this book seemed to have a larger section aimed towards people trying to defuse an ""angering"" person rather than help the person with the actual anger problem. It seemed to have more parent/child anger problems in mind than couples. This book is better for someone who has to deal with a person with an anger problem, not so good for someone trying to manage their anger."
4,good medical kit,"I just purchased Adventure Medical Kits Light and Fast Trail Kit. I think that it is a good starter medical kit for hikes, boating, hunting, and camping. It is small, compact, and light weight but still comes with a wide assortment of basic medical suplies."
1,absolutely horrible movie,"I rarely will give a movie only one star unless it contains very offensive material or has something else fundamentally wrong with it. There is nothing terribly offensive about this movie, but it is so terrible that I could not possible give it more than one star.The movie's soundtrack is comparable to a 70's porn flick, the action was boring, the script was obvious, and the plot was at times completely obvious and at other times completely inscrutable.Avoid this movie. You'll find that you've only wasted your time without having received any entertainment value. If you want to see Wesley Snipes in a good action movie, take a look at the first of Art of War."
1,upset consumer,Do not purchase this movie in bluray it does not play in either of my bluray players. My laptop has a bluray player also and I get the message content blocked. Save your money
1,Yuck! This is the grossest film I have ever seen! Never again!,"This has gottent to be the worst and grossest film I have ever seen! Yuck! I'm an adult that enjoys horror films, but this is not exactly a horror film. It is a film about human torture. It is a film about a nutty, mentally unbalanced and screwy surgeon that decideds he wants to create a human centipede. To do so, he has to kidnap three humans, which he does and hides in his surgery/hospital in his basement.I can not recommend this to anyone. I had nightmares the night I watched this. Not because of the movie, but because of the fact that there are literally nuts like this somewhere out there. That is the scary part. Gross. Disgusting."
2,"On the Positive, It Was Free w- Amazon Prime... In the End a Really Bad B-Grade Movie","This Film was laughable at times, however overall it was really bad. I'm a fan of horror, and although I'm sure this will likely go down as a cult-classic in certain circles, it would be really hard to recommend.Pros:*The villain provides a few creative and insanely-humorous moments.*The language barrier experienced by the U.S. tourists provides a few unexpected laughs.*Creative moments.Cons:*Really bad special effects*Outside of the primary villain, fairly weak acting."
3,Doctor runs amok!,"First of all, I think Eli Roth should have done this film with Lance Henrickson as the Doctor. Acting was ok (dunno how much you can do or say when you are one of the 'segments' of a centipede) Typical horror movie start with some torture porn thrown in the mix. Disturbing (not as bad as Audition), but actually I wanted to learn more about the doctors character and he became insane (anybody see his 'art' work on the walls). Good for a low budget torture-porn movie but it leaves me wanting more."
2,LOL.. You Want to do What? Really??,"All I can say is... What? lol. I want to meet the person who came up with the idea for this movie. Wait, no, I don't. I don't know. I'm so confused. Low budget, bad acting... But I have to give it 5 stars for unexpected shock value. I'm still not sure if it was entertaining or if I couldn't stop watching it because I couldn't believe what I was seeing."
4,Surgicial Horror,"A very dark and interesting look into the horror of a doctor turned serial killer looking for a new way to entertain himself with the unwilling flesh of his victims. This movie is only for the most ardent horror fans its unforgiving in its sobering look at a once great doctor reduced to a cold and souless monster who takes 3 people and conjoins them in the most horrorific way possible, a MUST see!!"
1,"Not Horror, just Torture","This is not a horror movie. It is a movie about human torture. Plain and simple.The hype about this movie is the confusion that this is art, or even falls within the realm of the horror (or psychological drama) genre. It doesn't. At first I thought this was going to be a very dark-humor ""it's so bad, it's good"" type movie. No.It's not scary, it's not humorous, it's not entertaining, and it is very poorly made on a number of levels.It's not the gross-out factor that bothers me so much. It's that the movie is really about nothing other than a close-up look of human torture with no point or meaning. Mean-spirited is an understatement. Seriously.If you like horror movies, skip this.If you like watching people suffer, being mutilated, and being tortured, then you will enjoy this movie."
1,Garbage...,"If you have half a brain in that head of yours, do not... DO NOT... insult it by watching this tripe. I've seen some bad films in my time but this has got to be the worst of the bunch. There is nothing redeeming in this film. It isn't even ""so bad, it's good;"" it's just bad."
4,what the???,This movie freaked me out. I am a big horror fan and I have pretty muchseen it all. The end of this film is one of the most disturbing things Ihave every encountered.
3,human centipede,I have no idea what to make of this film. It was very.... unique. I liked the...centi..pede..The plot is simple. A German doctor who is known for seperating conjoined twins is mad and now wants to basically conjoin people into one. The centipede itself... i'm stuck in the middle of saying it was cool or dumb. I don't think the film bad but i seen better. It's worth checking out either way. I'm loss at words honestly. I'm not at all disturbed since i seen plenty but i'm not sure exactly what i was hoping for with this....film... hmmmmmmmmmmm
3,Overhyped Bore with little blood or gore.,"The idea behind this film, the story is far worse the what you will see here. This movie is not very disturbing outside its subject matter and is rather boring and super slow paced. The acting is insanely bad, but... The Doctor, even with his bad acting does come off extremely creepy and gets under your skin. There is maybe a seconds flash of nudity (side boob), very little blood and not much here to give a film an R or Unrated in my opinion. This film is all hype and nothing within lives up to what it claims."
3,Different horror movie,This was a totally different type of movie for me. Left me wondering if there will be a follow up movie to this. It was a little disappointing but I still enjoyed it.
1,Fast forward...the whole way through,"Tough to tell who is in more pain, the viewer or the three people turned into a centipede. Take the time you would've used to watch this movie and ponder your navel lint. You'll be ahead on all accounts."
4,"It's a fun, but f'd up ride","Listen to the concept or watch the trailer of Human Centipede and you will immediately know if this movie is for you or not. Nothing will change after watching it either. I could not believe the idea and was so intrigued (and a bit disgusted, but in a good way) that I was enthrawed throughout the entire movie.Is it a perfect movie? Not at all. There are a few storyline flaws and holes, but the whole point of this movie it what it says it's about. What's the funniest part is comments people make about the goriness of the movie. It actually is fairly tame compared to Hostel, Hills Have Eyes, The Collector, and other gore-porn type movies. I think it's just the idea that freaks people out.Just settle down, drink some alcohol, and enjoy this f'd up ride!"
1,hmm..,Nothing special. just gross.. and not gross in an intriguing artistic way.. just gross like a dirty outhouse... boring and stupid.. glad it was free
5,Excellence In Horror,"I was awed by this film. I had read all the reviews. What I saw did not reflect what I had read. I was completely captivated by this film. I found the acting first rate. Hats off to Dieter Laser! I want to see more of him in future films. He makes this film worth watching. The other actors are also in fine performance. Ashley Williams shines. A bright future in film awaits her.While I would agree that the subject matter of this film is a bit striking, it is by no means as bad as the torture films by Eli Roth. In my opinion, those films should have been banned or rated X. This film is more of a character study. What makes this doctor tick? What drove him to this madness? Just as in Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the doctor is Kurtz. ""If one does what God does enough times, one becomes as God is."" - Hannibal Lector"
3,Funny Thing Is.....,"I find it funny that most of the people giving this movie 1 or 2 stars make a point of bad mouthing those who are drawn to this type of movie. Fans of the genre, and yes, there is a genre, will appreciate this movie for what it is. It's shock value alone is good for a few laughs. The most important thing to remember is that IT'S NOT REAL!!!! To those reviewers that wonder how anyone could watch this movie, I have only one thing to say. You watched it, didn't you? If you didn't, then why are you reviewing it? If you don't like these types of movies, don't watch them. While it wasn't the best movie, it certainly wasn't the worst. I think movies like Titanic, Gone with the Wind and any remake suck eggs, but that's just my opinion."
4,Sad man and his hobbies.,"Well after all the hype and many stories I have heard about this film I set down to this gym.I like it and think it is a good horror/torture porn movie with some very good actors. I just think the ending was pretty sad. I am not saying it is a bad ending just a sad ending.I am not going over the plot as one look at any preview or review tells you way more then you should know before setting down to view this film. I must say Dr. Heiter (Dieter Laser) is what makes this worth seeing, this dude is CREEPY and pulls this role off like no other. Gore hounds will be disappointed by the lack of blood and guts but the sick story should pull you threw.See it."
1,"This movie is foul, and not in a good way","This movie is not art, or is it horror. It's just foul. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original) was a classic that was gruesome, but it provided serious tension and fear. That adrenaline fight or flight response that draws us to horror films. This movie is nothing of the sort, and anyone who attempts to justify this trash by saying that it was humorous is by definition as sick and deprived person themselves. There was nothing funny about this film like the goofy humor in Piranha 3D or some of the smart humor in Scream.This movie is foul. The morality of anyone who laughs at the screams and pain of others as they are forced to digest the bowel movements of someone else sown to their very face is definitely in question."
2,"Not very good, definitely not a true horror movie in traditional sense",Watch it if you are curious and have nothing else to watch. The mad doctor definitely has lost his mind as his attempt to create his masterpiece has no medical and scientific understanding about separate gastric systems... More of a demented exhibition than traditional horror. I would definitely not recommend if you are a traditional horror fan.
4,disgusting beyond belief--but recommended,"Several times I had the dry heaves. So disgusting when the Doctor was yelling ""Feed her! Feed her!"" Yet, I couldn't turn it off--was mesmerizing. Ashley Williams and Ashlynn Yennie would obviously do anything for their first major movie part. Wonder how many casting couches they've been on? Can you imagine having your filmography list this to your credit? ""Hey, mom and dad! Look! I'm a star! Just had to kiss a little ass!"""
1,DIsgusting,"Not entertaining and who comes up with this fecal material???? I mean really - piecing people together from anus to mouth so that the first person eats food and the others eat the waste of the person they are attached to. This is not entertainment - nothing like SAW which at least had an intellectual story line. This is just plain ""Crap"" ok. I said it. IF I could give it less than zero I would!"
1,Vile,"I wish I could un-see The Human Centipede, but it's too late for me.Not chilling, not scary, and certainly not clever; it is a truly unpleasant torture flick. You will feel guilty for the minutes of your life you have wasted if you don't turn it off the first time you say to yourself ""this has got to get better soon."" More disturbing than the actual images, however, is that someone had to dream it up."
2,Too ecletic for a smooth continuous listen,"this is simply too ecletic for my tastes. It starts off with Way we Used to by Cevin Fisher, and portions of this song weave throughout the mix to good effect. This is a good start, and the following track Feel What You Know is good soulful house. Track 3 is another solid selection, with guitar weaving throughout the beat. Track 4 veers off course with a grating male voice wailing, and Track 5 So Far Away, while initally pleasant veers off into high-pitch wonker teritory. The next few tracks feature not really ""deep"" house with latin percussion or harmonica jamming, before dropping to the generic diva-whaling Music is My Life. It ends on a good note with the last track, but getting to it isn't worth it.Overall this disc may work if you want to dance, but as casual listening, it doesn't work for me- it maintains no theme or groove you can lock in to."
2,Less than expected,"The set is smaller than I thought. It also didn't include some commonly used symbols which was a disappoinment. I can't really suggest that anyone else order this product. I really does need some improvement. The booklet was okay, but had a lot of empty space that could have had more information, but it was very eye catching. I also didn't get the dark black results that were shown on some of the examples sprinkled throughout the booklet. I don't know if that was because of the ink or the material used to make the stamps."
1,"Sorry, no love for this book","I am Erich Segal's #1 fan; I've read and re-read all of his other books so many times, my husband laughs at me. But this one is an absolute dud. Instead of involving us in what's happening, (much less involving the characters), Mr. Segal just reports what happened, many times covering years of time in one paragraph. It reads like a college application essay. The writing feels stilted and unemotional, even though he's describing something very emotional. I hate to say it, because I've loved all his other books, but skip this one. Re-read ""Love Story"" instead for a love story you will truly love!"
4,Love it!,"This ice cream maker is great. We bought it to make low sugar ice creams, and it has been easy and wonderful."
1,Absolutely awesome,I love this product as it is quiet and makes just enough ice cream for two of us. We make several different flavors so we have plenty for guests. I have experimented with several recipes I found on the internet. There are recipes out there that do not cost a lot of money and are truely delicious. I would buy it again in a heart beat.
1,HORRIBLE MACHINE,"I purchased this machine because of its high star rating from so many other customers. The machine worked fine the first time I used it although it took an hour for the ice cream to get to a firmer consistency. The next night when I wanted to use my gelato maker again---it didn't work. I turned the machine on and the churn paddle would no longer turn! I called customer support listed in the manual, and they were of no help. Save your money and buy a different machine!! I wish I had!"
1,Ice Cream Ice Cream we all scream for ice cream!!!,"But to no avail!!! I got this maker for Christmas. Imagine the disappointment I and my children experienced when the blade froze after running approximately 5 seconds, never to run again!!! This item may not be the most expensive, but it is still spendy enough that one should be able to rely on its quality!!! And I thought I had done enough research and read enough reviews... ah well, it's off to Mio Gelato we go!"
2,Lello -- Poor costumer Service/ good product once problem resolved with Amazon,"Unit did not get cold at all. Delivery fine. Not a lot of noise. When I called Lello they had an ""I really don't care"" attitude and didn't help at all! HOWEVER, when I contacted AMAZON.COM, they were a help and told me how to return the item and use the return lable to avoid shipping costs. The NEXT DAY I went to the UPS store to sent the package back; to my surprise, when I returned home, Amazon.com had OVERNIGHTED the replacement without even recieving the return yet. Now, THAT'S what I call costumer service!!New unit works wonderfully. Gets cold fast and ice cream in no time"
3,"Campfest, but worth the rental","""Devil's Advocate"" is definitely a movie to check out on DVD and widescreen TV wherever possible. The production on this movie is probably the biggest reason for that, and the acting second. If that sounds like a criticism, believe me, it isn't.Good movies shouldn't be about spectacle, they should be about storytelling; this one succeeds somewhat, although it's not helped by having Keanu Reeves play the lead. He's competent, but uninteresting. No, the real stars of this movie are the set/casting/production departments, make no mistake.And having Pacino mime Sinatra's ""It Happened In Monterey"" was nothing short of genius--I laughed out loud in the theatre, and I wasn't alone.The downsides of this DVD are definitely the lack of options with the extended scenes; why they decided to cram Taylor Hackford's commentary down our throats on that one, I have no idea. And a few of them could certainly have been added to the film without much hassle. It's already pretty long."
5,A ONE of A Kind Film with a Perfect Cast.,"A Great, spine chilling movie that is sure to provoke your thoughts on the power's and reality of Satan. If not, at least the Morality of each and every choice we make and how it effects us and others and the motivation behind each choice we make. Sure makes you want to be as Humble as possible for you never know the forces behind your decisions and the profound impact they can have. I tell you after watching this movie, sure made me want to examine any choice I had made to feed my own ego regardless of the consequences it may have down the road. A great movie and an ALL STAR Cast."
4,The movie has grip!,The movie takes a strong grip on the viewer although at times offensive in terms of its language towards GOD. The overall theme is however thought provoking as it reflects how the devil makes you lose when you think you are in the fast track and winning !
3,Reeves and Pacino makes a lovely couple...,It's a unusual kind of movie with great actors and a funny storyline; good vs evil on a lawfirm. Great ending...
2,Pieces won't stay together!,"We inherited this set from a cousin and ended up throwing it into the recycling bin because it was more frustrating than fun. Even on a hard, flat surface, the pieces would not stay together. Marble runs are great fun, but try another brand."
4,Easy to assemble,"Though I purchased this set for my 5 year old, my 2 year old has spent HOURS building marble runs with it. It is his favorite toy, and has been for months. It is easy enough for him to put together simple runs completely by himself, though the runs my 5 year old makes are ""fancier"". Both children love this toy. We have other marble sets which are much more difficult to put together (and thus VERY frustrating when it inevitably gets knocked down), so this is the one they play with the most. If it gets knocked down, they just build it again. I highly recommend this marble set for younger children."
5,Fun for hours!,"My kids (ages 3 & 5) got one of these sets as a gift. They didn't seem to have enough pieces to make the marble runs as big as they wanted, so we purchased two more sets as add-ons. They will play with them for hours! Great educational toy promoting creativing and problem solving skills."
5,Awsome!!,"I love this book because every little part of it is very interesting and you are hooked to it the whole time. It has a little mystery, some action, and the author is good at descriptions. This book reminds me of the books by Roald Dahl. I recommend this book to people of all ages."
3,Not bad..,"My son likes the characters that go along with the sub better than the sub itself, which sinks too much. It's really cute, though, and is very colorful."
5,Great Tool,Works great reaching into the black tanks from the toilette to get the remaining parts out. Avoid sticking it too far down so you don't break a sensor from the spinning part on the bottom.
4,Did the job,"It did a good job of cleaning out material in the tank. The flexible hose navigated the route tht our plumbing required. The shut-off valve on the stick dripped pretty badly, which was a nuisance."
4,Great for my motorhome,"I haven't used it yet in a used holding tank, but tested it on my new motorhome black water holding tank using both the on board water pressure and at home off my well pump pressure. It works much better at home but still is adequate with the MH's system, which may be all I have when camping at state parks."
4,Tank Cleaner,Very handy and convenient. Something was stuck in our rv tank causing the led board to show 2/3 full. I used this once and cleared it right up.
3,be careful,"If your'e a fan of Crimson, you would like it, it might even bring some nostalgies to you. If you want something more than that, you might as well pass it. Technically speaking they do well, apart from the singing, but it is too predictable.This group has generally been all too overrated by the progscene and the reviewers. Yes, it is good, ok, no big problem, but not SO good. Basically all the compositions is based on a single idea, and when you have heard the dark mellotrone sound, sometimes accompanied by a flute, piercing through the structure of every little tune you get somewhat bored. The singing, when such occurs which isn't too often, is just awful, so try check the instrumental tracks.If you insist to buy an Anglagard recording mind that basically all their three works sound pretty much the same so you might be well of with just one of them."
3,Pretty sweet...,"This album is great. However, if you don't have Marcus Garvey, Man In The Hills, or Dry & Heavy, get those albums first. They have a more accesible sound than this album. This album gets a little bit repetitive especially on ""Follow Marcus Garvey"" and ""Jah Guh Raid."" The album has a dark mood. It's not bad though. The best songs are ""Columbus"" and ""Road Foggy."" Definitely essential roots reggae, but not as good as the three albums mentioned previously."
4,Calverts return,"Excellent period piece from an often neglected time of the Hawks. Any Hawk fan should buy this in preference to the many dubious quality comps and cash in albums, if only to get the ultra rare Time for sale (a proper Calvert track, not another meandering instrumental recorded in a cement mixer.) and Back on the streets a single from 77 hardly available else where. Quality sleeve, decent length, reasonable sound, (it was 20+ years ago, bound to be a bit ropey.) Well done Griffin, now can we have some more please?"
3,Interesting book.,"A Search in Secret India - Paul Brunton This book is a curious report of an English journalist's contact with the ""mysterious"" India. Armed with the best intentions possible in that time, Paul Brunton reveals to us all the prejudices and deformed ideas that the Occident has of the East. And he played a role in the vulgarization of several erroneous ideas that nowadays are accepted with the largest naturalness. Of special interest is the chapter IX ""The Hill of the Holy Fire"", where P. Brunton tells us his encounter with Shri Ramana Maharshi, a true Illuminated (obs: the ones that surrounded him at the end of his life and that proclaimed themeselves as their heirs weren't of the master's height). The reading of that chapter is worth the book!"
1,Hogwash!,"Brunton was the P.T. Barnum of the exotic travelogue.He WAS able to write bestselling books about mysterious locales, but they were full of obvious inaccuracies and flat-out fiction. He wrote whatever he felt would sound dramatic and self-aggrandizing. In this book he relates a meeting with Meher Baba that has little to do with the actual interaction between the two. Although Brunton went on to be one of Meher Baba's most famous critics, in person he represented himself as a devout follower.I'm glad to see that his Ph.D. status is no longer attached to his name... he apparently made it up to lend more credibility to his writings.Check out Jeffrey Masson's 'My Father's Guru: A Journey through Spirituality and Disillusion' for more on Brunton's nonsense."
4,The Shelley Winters mystery,"Yes, I too think very highly of this movie. Thematically, it's truly a zero, and yet with all the great singing, dancing, comedy, and technicolor, who really cares?A previous reviewer said that he or she could not find Shelley Winters. I am reasonably certain she is the office girl in the ""Who's Complaining"" number."
2,less than mediocre,"i usually don't take the time to write reviews, but in this case i had to make an exception because the shoe is so bad. kenneth cole has dropped to a new low with the ""Unlisted"" brand. the entire shoe feels as if it is made out of rubber. imagine your crocs or tevas covered with a brown plastic molded to look like a dress shoe. that is what you get with this purchase. i'm sure at some price level this is a decent value, but for me it would be much closer to the $5 range rather than the $15 i paid. i'm serious; these shoes are that bad. shame on kenneth cole for such a mediocre product."
5,Great value,"These shoes are exceptional value. They have a great combination of comfort, appearance, and low price. They also fit well - they match the stated size."
2,"Nice looking shoe, but not very sturdy","This was a great looking shoe for the price. Unfortunately, it fell apart after less than a year of steady use."
3,good movie and well acted,"Reviews have been fair to poor; however, I enjoyed it. Friendships and conflicts abound and the plot is well constructed for the subject matter. Raul Julia is excellent and displays the charisma and range despite his limited role. Gibson and Russel pull off the friendship roles convincingly, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who I understand dislikes this movie so much she won't mention it, is dazzling as a restauraunter who is a perfectionist. The late J.T. Walsh noted as a fine actor by everyone is also convincing. I am not quite sure why the movie is rated so poorly compared to many movies in this class that are not as well acted. Perhaps this is a movie that requires personal moorings that reviewers like Maltin could not possibly have. The movie is a worthy weekend rental. The reason I reviewed this movie is that I have been looking for the soundtrack. Dave (Grusin) please send me the soundtrack (Smile)."
5,"The best movie Phieffer, Gibson, Russell, or Walsh has made!","Movie is well worth the cost. I loved the scenes between Gibson and Pfeiffer and the scenes between Pfeiffer and Russell. It seems her chemistry was great with either man. Movie had a great ending, and I thought the plot was sooo believable. You must see this movie. It will quickly become one of your favorites."
4,high tech heretic review for class,"The more I read this book, the more that I began to understand what it was about and the more I began to agree with Stoll.Stoll gives many good reasons to question the significance of computers in the classroom. Stoll challenges using computers in public schools because of the high cost, and the low benefits from it. Stoll also talks about technology in general.Stoll talks about what is wrong with computer learning in our society, by questioning every aspect of computing, especially the computer use in public schools.Stoll, however does not hate computers, he just hates how they are misused in schools. Cliffors Stoll is upset about how much money is being wasted on technology, that is used for the wrong reason.I feel that this book is a really interesting book that teaches alot. I agree with the author of this book when he says that technology will never replace the hands-on of school learning."
2,Sharp points buried in padding and colloquialisms,"High Tech Heretic continues Mr. Stoll's writing trajectory from Cuckoo's Egg and Silicon Snake Oil. Each succeeding book contains observations that you won't find in the cheering ""cyber"" press, but each also contains fewer of them buried in more and more padding.What is worth reading in High Tech Heretic could have been contained in a short magazine article, and an aggressive editor would have removed the jarring colloquialisms that jostle one another from page to page. Does starting every third paragraph with ""Hey"" appeal to educators who are the author's target audience?"
1,Not the advertised size for Cologne,"The web page says 3.3 oz. Cologne and 3.3 oz. Body Shampoo. However, the Cologne was only 1.6 oz. The outer packaging was mislabeled as 3.3 oz for both, but the bottle was only 1.6 oz and that is what it showed on the bottom."
5,Phil Is The Man !,"This album is true quality. Phil's work is phenomenal in this album. My favorite songs are #5 - To Fall in Love, and #6 - In Winter. They are classic love songs. The album's title song #1 was a surprise because it is more of a mid tempo upbeat song but, as you listen to the words, it fits with what you will get out of this album. That's one thing that I have always associated with Phil Perry and that is quality work. This album is total quality work. The melodies, lyrics, and Phil's voice are simply beautiful. It's a well-rounded album with a mixture of tunes, not all ballads. Just simply a marvelous piece of work. Treat yourself to this remarkable man's talent which is evident in this album!"
2,Yorkshire Terrier 2nd Edition,The book would be fine for a child or someone just purchasing a new pet. It has some helpful hints on housetraining and teaching commands. This book is NOT for the advanced yorkie breeder with any medical knowledge at all.
1,Five Month Life Span,"I bought this item: ""Sharpay Plush Fleece Queen Blanket, Red"" and also a ""Pinzon Microtech Full/Queen Blanket, Spice"" at the same time. I also purchased three throw-versions of the Microtech one.So far the Sharpay Flush one, this item, has survived five months and is ridiculously pilling everywhere. I've tried many methods to stop this and nothing works. If you've had success with this blanket, great! But I do NOT recommond buying this, and, if you like soft blankets, go with the Pinzon Microtech. It's almost identical to this product but better made and softer. The Microtech throws were also great! The Sharpay Fleece is now being confined to my basement and I am deciding if donating it to Goodwill is ethical or if I'll just drive whoever gets it insane from getting pills or ""fuzzies"" all over their clothing.The only positive thing about the Sharpay Plush Fleece is the lack of static. But it's the messiest blanket I've ever bought."
2,warm but sheads too much,Not really pleased with this purchase. Followed instructions and it sheaded even worse. Got red fuzz all over the black cormforter. It is very warm. It's a keeper if you can live with the lint.
3,Not Bad For The Price,"This is good if you have a tight budget and just want a decent, yet cheap stereo. I had mine for about 10 months then suddenly the cd player stopped working. I attempted to clean it, but that didn't help. Although it did not last very long, I was satisfied with the way it played when it worked."
5,"Mesmerizing, boldly honest and brutal masterpiece.",A magnificent achievement! Oddly touching psychology and searing brutality work together to create a portrait of a man who for all mankind represents how multifaceted we can become in the face of wide ranging experience. Made me hungry to experience new and exotic emotions and experiences. An eternal masterpiece which demands re-reading.
1,No room for medical / psychiatric conditions,"I have already reviewed this book, and explained that there is only blame for the parents and important adults in the child's life for being shy. Many, many people have emailed me, requesting more information about what other explanations there could be, because their children are not shy due to their environment of happy loving families. So this is an update to my original review.The book does not mention any treatable organic causes for apparent shyness in children, including but not limited to anxiety disorder, social phobia, and Asperger's Syndrome. None of these issues are discussed at all. This is a serious and inexcusable omission. All of them are treatable and controllable by medication and therapy. It seriously angers me that this book does nothing to address these concerns."
4,Upsetters Chillin',"Nice easy listening music from the band that backed Bob Marley in the Lee Perry produced days. Lotsa cool instrumentals, one with kettle drums from Carlton Barrett, Aston ""Familyman"" Barrett, Glen Adams and Reggie Lewis. Lost in a vault somewhere in Jamaica for years until Keyboardist Glen Adams found them, this is not a swamped up ""Scratch"" production but good come to work and lets record some reggae music. Spliffed up versions reminiscent of ""Grazing in the Grass"" (Tan Yah) and ""Moon River"" (Red on Red) make this a perfect outdoor summer selection"
5,Daryl's Best Solo Album - Perfect for CD Format!,"Unbelievably, this album is out of print. In spite of the fact that ""Dreamtime"" was a Top Five hit, it went gold and was well-received by the critics, you should go ahead and pick up the imported version unless you search online for the domestic release.This album, co-produced with Dave Stewart has the best rocking guitars and basslines you'll hear on CD. Very strong musical production. Daryl's songwriting and vocals are unapproachable throughout. Best songs are ""Dreamtime"", ""Next Step"", ""Let It Out"", ""Right As Rain"" (with a Joni Mitchell back-up), ""Someone Like You"" (w/guitar solo). There is a version of ""Someone Like You"" with a sax solo which is available as a 12"" vinyl single (search the used record stores or Amazon. Try also Gemm.Com).You can't miss with this bit of perfection but try to find a domestic copy first and save some dollars...Now where's John Oates?"
1,NO Tenk You Vedy Much!,"This videotape is the shoddiest product I have purchased from Amazon, ever! And I'm not blaming them...It's a 35 minute documentary recorded at 6 hr. speed with no hi-fi and looks as if it has been put through a lo-fi inducement device. The material appears to be taken from an NBC special on Kaufman from a few years ago, slightly rearranged and combined with some hideous and inaccurate narration. Also we get to see more Howdy Doody footage that is probably in the public domain, then we do of Kaufman footage. This tape even lifts promo material from the forthcoming Jim Carrey biopic. By all means avoid this tape and stick with something legitimate. I hope the people who made this thing get sued by the copyright holders (NBC, ABC, etc.) so at least I have a collectors item when this thing gets forced off the market. BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, OR BETTER YET, THROW YOUR 9.95 IN THE GUTTER, YOU'LL GET MORE FROM THAT!"
1,"""Tank You Veddy Much"" Tanks","This 35 minute retrospective of Kaufman's career is recorded in SLP mode, and the clips that are used look like 3rd generation dubs made on a home video setup. There is a good bit of Andy performing, but 90% of it is overdubbed with a horrible narration, so all you get is the visual. The whole thing looks and sounds like it was put together in somebody's basement using equipment bought from a local camera store. Obviously a quickie project to make a buck off the interest generated by the upcoming ""Man On The Moon"" film. Not worth the money I paid for it."
4,i thought it was pretty good,"This movie tells you almost everything you would ever need to know about this man. some people said it was boring, but i didnt think so.it did show alot of pictures and should them twice sometimes.but i think that this would be a movie for people who want to learn about him. not someone who wants comedy and a good laugh.Andy kaufman is my hero!!thanx for reading."
4,No complaints,Doesn't come with a fuse already and that is fine. Felt solid enough and it is the basic fuse design. I had two different 4 gauge wires wired to this fuse and if you have some extra insulated cables the weather seal will not fit over it so you just will have to do without.Does it's job and that was all I needed.
4,Dunston Checks In,"Purchased this movie due to its local non-availability. Was looking for some nostalgic movies from when I was younger and thought of this movie. I wasn't able to find it so I turned to Amazon. Very happy amazon had the movie, and at a reasonable price. Great movie with only one gripe: standard format. I mean, c'mon, they haven't even sold standard format tv's in almost a decade now. The formatting is tolerable but unnecessary in this day and age. Time to do away with this antiquated format. Only other comment being that the disc itself looks like a CD-R (no artwork, one sided). Otherwise, a fun movie from a respected seller."
5,Cute boat!,I got this for [...] so it was a great buy. It was a fun addition to our Geotrax collection but I wouldn't pay anymore than that.
1,In the beginning . . .,"there was Procol Harum, the ""inventors"" of Crock Rock -- pretentiousness for the ""classical"" music aspirant without the necessary effort.From this point, those who couldn't compete with such as The Beatles in the field of creativity opted instead for being consciously ""different,"" thereby trumping the merely excessively self-indulgent rockers.It wouldn't be long before rock 'n roll, the democratic alternative to white-only MOR, and classist ""classical"" music, renamed ""rock"" by its second generation, would splinter and devolve into numerous ""alternative to rock"" ""rock"" musics, each ahistorically claiming to be the True One.There is nothing in the history of ""rock"" more retrogressive than crock rock mysteriously labelled instead ""Progressive Rock"" (or, if one is ""hip,"" ""Prog Rock""). Anyone for ""Rage Rock""?Kill the phony beast before it pollutes the minds of future generations."
4,Nice basic shoe,I like the shoe. it is nice and basic which is what i was looking for. I ordered a 10 N and it is not really that Narrow across the arch. but i put an insole in it and its is great.
4,Always Reliable,Basic loafer at a good price of $49.00 Look great. Nice thing about ordering online is they are NOT used as store samples as most small sizes are so they are completely NEW. Felt broken in after only one day
4,Nice shoes,These shoes were very nice and just what I was looking for but I had to return them because theydid not fit.
1,WRONG ITEM,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON (SHOEFLAKE) AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO. HOWEVER, I AM OUT $60+ DOLLARS."
2,Not so much fun with Ernie,"My 18 month old son loves Ernie, and I was so happy when I purchased this toy. I was a little disappointed because it does not do what it is supposed to do. When the toy is in the the tub, it just tips over. The propeller on the back is very loud, and I get nervous when my son winds it up."
5,Soundtrack to the life I want,"If someone said to me find the soundtrack for the life you wish to live this album would be it. The hope ,the sense of timeless peace, the ascension of a higher more beautiful existence to come. If this this is what you want in your life. Then meditate on this album. Maybe for a least for a few hours you can get there."
2,"Learn a ""new language"" to read this book....","THIS IS NOT ENGLISH. You may have to learn 2spanish-english"" to read this book.It is ridicoulous. The technical part is good, but you really need to spend 50 minutes per page in order to understand the translation. It's a pitty because you have good coverage of Equity and Bond-Linked structured notes...with little math. Easy to follow but only the math...BUY THE SPANISH EDITION (if any)...Products like Asian Equity deposits, Digital Ranges, Step-ups, Range Accruals...are covered but with little implementattion guidance for Matlab or Excel code. Formulae is always available...advance users may find it usefull...not much proofs though."
1,"A terrible, unwanted surprise after their promising debut","The first Grapefruit album (""Around Grapefruit"", also available on CD from Repetoire) was a delightful late '60s pop album, fueled by nice harmonies, catchy tunes and sympathetic instrumentation. Not really essential, per se, but surely worth having if you are a fan of pop music from pop music's golden age.This album, Grapefruit's second (and last) is, in contrast, complete junk. In place of high quality pop music, we get generic hard rock and boogie. It's really hard to believe this is even the same group. No matter how much you enjoy the first album you don't need this one. There isn't a single tune on this album that ranks with the material on the first one. Too bad.Things that make you go hmmm... aside: Before this album was recorded, John Lennon offered Grapefruit the chance to record the then-unreleased Beatles track ""Two of Us"". They passed. Yikes."
1,Disappointed,"I have built several homes through contractors who have lied, cheated, and attempted to steal from me during the construction process. I have lived in homes built by contractors that have severe problems and critical mistakes made during construction that cannoit be repaired, yet now this book's revelation is to hire another idiot to build one's home because the average persson is just not smart enough to see the project through. Obviously this is a book written by and for contractors who still believe that no can do what they do. i am very disappointed."
3,Great Looking but not worth the Price,"I rated these shoes a 3 because both shoes were not made to the same specs..At least in my case. The cusion on the inside of the right shoe is higher then the left. They also tend to wrinkle ( the leather) very easily and quickly BUT, They are a very durable shoe so far. They do have good looks; just be sure to buy shoehorns/stretchers to keep the leather from wrinkling too much. I believe the retail price for these shoes is above $100. That is way too much. I took advantage of an Amazon special were I got them for $39.97 I believe. Great looks and durable ( weather proof) but not worth the hefty and inflated price tag."
4,"3 stars for the material, 1 more for being adventurous.","Hall & Fripp sounds a lot different than Hall & Oates. Maybe it's the ambient soundscapes, the backward guitar loops, the ""Starless and Bible Black""-style monster riffs. This is a very interesting recording and probably more enjoyable to Fripp fans than H&O fans - all of the songs sound like Daryl Hall but the arrangements are decidedly Frippian. Plus there's two Robert Fripp tracks from ""Exposure"", including ""North Star"" which sounds a lot like a certain ""Matte Kudasai"" by another Fripp project. A very interesting addition to both Hall's and Fripp's respective catalogs."
4,Forget the rest of the album,"That one song, ""Sacred Songs"" is an absolute monster. The rest of the album/cd sounds like Hall 'n Oates outakes w/o Oates and with Rob't Fripp's (there's no other way to discribe it) ""Yoko-guitar."""
3,Difficult machine but makes good cafe lattes.,"This is a bare bones somewhat flimsy mostly plastic espresso maker. The operating instructions are woefully inadequate. I had to call the support number three times before I was able to understand what was needed in order to ""prime"" the machine to be able to draw a cup of espresso. It is not simple to load or clean. That said, it is quite inexpensive and it makes an impressive cup of coffee. I cannot recommend its purchase but with patience it does the job and might be worth the effort for someone on a very tight budget."
2,Broke almost instantly,"We had this machine for a week and than had to return it. The cappuccino jet frother just stopped working. It would produce steam but not foam. It was ok while it worked so I'm giving it two stars instead of one.Other cons to consider:- instruction manual is horrible- espresso is very weak; our Krups steam espresso maker made much stronger coffeePros:- relatively easy to operate, once you decipher the manual- nice cremaAll in all I would NOT buy this machine again. Going from a steam to a pump espresso maker, DeLonghi BAR32 was a big disappointment."
5,Excellent purchase,"Awesome machine, once you make 1 or 2 expressos, its a really easy process. The expresso it makes is great, the machine is excellent quality, and it only takes about 15 seconds to actually make the expresso once you've prepared the grinds. It takes about 30 - 45 seconds to warm up for the first one, and then you can pretty much make a second and third with no warm up time. I bought this for work to share with a co-worker, we use it 3 or 4 times a day and it has worked perfectly so far - we've had it for about 3 months. Needless to say, work morale is way up! I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a great quality expresso maker."
1,"Failed after 3 months, 2+ months still waiting for repair","Good machine but if you need repair be ready to wait for a very long time. After 3 months of use my steam valve started to become stiff and eventually started to leak. I called Delonghi and got referred to take my machine to a local (thank goodness its local) repair shop. 2+ months later I'm still waiting for the replacement part to come in from Delonghi. I'm sick of ""instant expresso"" while I wait and wait and wait for the replacement part.Delonghi does not truly support their products. When it worked it was a good machine but if I ever get this back, and if it fails again, I'm buying a better product."
5,Makes a great espresso!,"If you love espresso, this is a great espresso/cappuccino maker!It's extremely easy to use and makes a great espresso. It's fast and makes the perfect cup of espresso instantly that you can compare to an expensive single cup at a restaurant. Start up is easy and has 2 separate thermostats to control temperature. It has lasted me for a few years, but its time for an upgrade. The stainless steel version is definitely the way to go. With the new one you can use either pods or ground coffee, it gives a rich and creamy froth, no start up preparation, brews the perfect cup of espresso and perfect temperature and will last forever! I can't wait to try this one out when it gets here!! My girlfriend is going to love it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CNG7RY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B001CNG7RY&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazon070f-20"
1,"Don't Bother, It'll be a drip-coffeemaker in 6 months","I should have believed the negative reviews - talk about irrational, wishful-thinking decision-making! In less than 5 months, the pump is a total fail. Yes, I took it apart and cleaned every part with vinegar and water, in-between descaling. Coffee is wasted, electricity wasted, waiting for some pump action. I bought it barely used, it worked beautifully for a few months, though it never had enough pressure to leave a solid coffee-clump in the basket - it was always soupy, instead. If you want to create more plastic landfill every 4-6 months, go ahead, waste your money and taint your karma. Otherwise, save up, buy an espresso machine made in Italy, where they're built to last and to make true, rich espresso. Only Saeco and Hamilton Beach make espresso machines in the USA, and both brands have terrible reviews. This one is from China, a sheer plastic horror."
1,Didn't work for me,"This is one of the few returns I've made to Amazon. When I got the machine, the water reservoir was wet, maybe it had been used? I was still fine with giving it a go. However, no matter how loosely I packed the grounds it would not make a good shot of espresso, it seemed clogged. After a few hours trying different things, I packed it in."
1,Had high hopes for this product,"Purchased this product after reading reviews in various sources. My desire was to get a good or at least a decent Espresso machine at a relatively low cost. All went well for about 3 1/2 weeks then the espresso began to drip out into the cup at a very slow rate (15 minutes for a cup) Tried cleaning the unit - descaled, the whole bit all to no avail. Only got about 20 espressos from this machine before problem.Beware, this machine will work fine for a while but then you have problems."
2,just ok,"i would not purchase this model again...instead, i would spend more money the next time for a better quality item"
2,LOUD,I bought this a few months ago and the whole thing is not amazing. It rattles like crazy when you turn it on - to the point where you have to put your hand on the water lid to keep it quiet. The espresso is half foam when it comes out. Not recommended.
4,"convenient, great for two, good buy for price","I bought this for my daughter for her apartment at school. She loves it, the quality and ease of use. makes great latte which she loves.Worth it if you want to save money and have tasty latte at home."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This machine made excellent espresso for about 10 months and then suddenly died. I used the machine 2-3 times a day, had de-scaled the machine regularly, but the pump seemed to lose it's pressure as time went by. Last week the machine stopped taking water from the tank altogether. De'Longhi does not have a service center in my area so I have to ship, at my own cost, the machine to New York. Ridiculous. From other customer reviews I see that this is an ongoing problem with De'Longhi. They need to either produce a quality machine that lasts, or be prepared to cover the cost, including shipping, to fix it."
1,Not Happy!,"I recently purchased this model and cannot recommend this to anyone who like's latte. This unit only puts out two shots of week espresso. I have tried all types of coffee including Starbucks and Caribou. I even had them grind it, to make sure my mill was working properly. I had a Mr. Coffee that put out better Latte. It does give you that creamy foam on top but lacks the dark carmel flavor you get at the big boy shops. I am looking to replace this with something else, I have been making my own for 16 years so, I think I know how to make a good cup. I just can't do it with this model."
4,"Good looking machine, but just haven't had excellent espresso out of it yet","I purchased this machine based on user reviews, both at Amazon and elsewhere. Overall, I'm pleased with the operation of the machine, ease of use, quality, etc. The only thing is that I still haven't been able to make a really good espresso or latte with it. I'm experimenting with grinds, beans, and amount of pressure on the grounds before brewing, and I hope that I do get there, but so far, it has been mediocre.Also, I have been unable to find the 'pods' at major grocery stores or at Super Target, which was disappointing. I thought those might take a factor out of my control and it might make a better cup."
1,replacement doesn't work either!,"It arrived very fast, looked great, BUT JUST DIDN'T WORK! The steamer was operational, but no water would come out of the machine to produce coffee. I followed all the instructions, waited for at least 10 min, while it made all the noises and vibrations pretending to work, except no water would come out. I did make sure the water was getting into the machine (saw bubbles of air coming out when placing water tank). Read all the reviews online. Consulted my friend who has the same espresso machine for a year now and it works well. But he also confirmed I was doing everything right and the machine still did not work.So considering all the good reviews I ordered a replacement. And guess what?.. IT DOESN'T WORK EITHER! SERIOUSLY???!! I am very disappointed, not sure if it even worth to order third replacement."
2,URIAH HEEP,"NOT THE CD THAT WAS ADVERTISED.THE ORIGINAL WAS ADVERTISED, AND I RECEIVEDTHIS LIVE VERSION. NOT THE STUDIO RECORDINGQUALITY AS THE FIRST URIAH HEEP.TOO MUCH HASSLE TO CONTACT,VENDOR, THENSEND CD OFF FOR REIMBURSEMENT."
5,A FREESTYLE/DANCE CLASSIC CD,"This is Safire's debut album - and it is one of the best cd's by a freestyle artist. I still get a kick out of listening to it today. I remember this cd being a big seller and delivering such hits as - BOY IVE BEEN TOLD, THINKING OF YOU, LOVE IS ON HER MIND, GONNA MAKE IT, YOU SAID U LOVED ME and LET ME BE THE ONE - all top dance/pop billboard hits-"
2,NOT WORTH IT,"I bought this wind up Elmo toy for my 10 month old daughter to play in the tub. I dont know if I got a defective one or not, but I would wind it up and it would sink to the bottom of the tub. She did get a kick out of the propellers turning and the clicking noise but it sure doesn't float like it should."
5,Mircobiology Atlas,The book is very helpful especially in looking at slides of bacteria that you've no idea of what it looks like.
3,Slightly misleading,"It was loose leaf and some of the holes are torn, therefore it shouldn't have been sold at full price or in excellent condition."
2,Tuner does not work,"If I could tune this easily, I would give it a great review. It is simple, easy to play, and pleasing to the ear. Unfortunately, the harp arrived painfully out of tune and the tuning key does not fit properly. It does not turn several of the pegs. Some of the pegs will not turn even with a gentle twist of pliers.I don't mind tuning a harp, but the original equipment should work.This harp arrived with a small crack in the wood. It did not come with a pick, which surprised me. The Amazon product description says ""handcrafted in Europe"" but the box says ""Made in China."" I would like to order a replacement but I am concerned about the quality of workmanship. What a disappointment!"
3,A good toy if you have the patientce...,"The price is reasonable however this is VERY difficult to keep in tune. Unless there is an experienced (and patient) musician in the family (who happens to own a chromatic tuner) I would not be able to recommend it. I say this having played (and tuned) my guitar for many years with no issue. Even with my chromatic tuner I could not really get it close and ended up taking it to my local Guitar Center- it was that much of a pain. But the tone is nice and the kid I gave it to as a gift does enjoy it. He especially likes the music sheets that slide in and make it easy to play right away (though he has reportedly uttered the phrase, '...but it never stays in tune'. A good toy if you have the patience..."
5,Highly recommend; Art Pepper is a genius,"Art Pepper's genius is clear on this record. I love his lyricism. The alternate take of ""The Prisoner"" is my favorite track. Extremely moving."
1,wutheringheights,"i purchesed this movie from movie mars, the movie will not work! i e-mailed movie mars---no responce! we have a new dvd player, therefore i do not think it is a problem with the player. will someone help me resolve this problem?"
2,Not a good make of a great story.,"The reasons I only give this movie two stars.1: In the beginning when mr lockwood went to wuthering heights, he got stranded there due to a snow storm. In the movie though they made it a thunderstorm. That change to me made no sense.2: The character casting was alful. I didn't think one charater in the movie was casted good.3: The movie didn't flow very well, And unless you read the book or know the story it will be very hard to follow.I would not recommend this movie, The 1939 edition was better.The book was great."
1,A Sad Day's Work for Ralph Fiennes,"I rented this movie because I have recently read Wuthering Heights and now feel that I understand it, and because I adore Ralph Fiennes. But I turned it off after about 25 minutes because I just couldn't watch anymore. Not even accurate, though it is supposedly more accurate than the one from the 40's. I still adore Ralph, and I still think Juliette Binoche is a wonderful actress, but this movie is not worth wasting the money on."
4,wuthering heights: a review,"This is a good version of ""Wuthering Heights"", full of the romance and passion that is in the book itself. Laurence Olivier was suave and romantic in the role of Healthcliff in the old version of Heights; but I have to say I like Ralph Fiennes in the role better; he brings the edginess and spunk and rage to the Healthcliff role that Olivier romanticised a little too much."
5,The Only Good One,"There are at least three versions of this adapted book, those three being the only versions I personally know of, and this one is by far the best. Expecting yet another jaunted version of Emily Bronte's best and most famous book, I taped this movie off of HBO and found that it was one that I would gladly see again. The incredibly beautiful Juliette Binoche easily played both Cathys, and Ralph Fiennes was a surprisingly vengeful Heathcliff. I actually was able to follow along with the book in my lap, unlike most of the other adapted-Bronte-novel movies. The only burrs that stuck in my saddle were personal thoughts of the supporting cast, and nothing that affected the movie itself. This is an excellent rendition, as the general opinion speaks of, and should be shown in any Literature class that wishes to show a version of the novel. As good as any Sparknotes."
3,UNDESERVED CRITICISM FOR AN ADAPTATION,"Finally found it, I'll admit I only watched it because of Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche and wasn't aware that Sinead O'Connor was the narrator/Bronte until I researched it on the net and read some terribly harsh things about this movie, which IS NOT BAD at all.I've never read the book, and this movie won't make me want to read it, but still Fiennes and Binoche are believable as grief-stricken lovers. Though their acting wasn't as polished as the English Patient's it did show thier potential and I was very impressed with the delivery of the story. I liked Sinead O'Connor's narration and I liked Janet McTeer's performance. And the muscical score kept playing in my head a few days after watching it. I hope Fiennes and Binoche do another movie together, but that's just wishful thinking."
3,Average,"Although I love this movie and it's music, I was very disappointed by this version. I did not feel the love, passion and connection I expected from these two wonderful actors. I hear there is a better version in the 1970's. I'll have to watch that one now..."
5,Great dog treats,My dog loved them so much that he tipped the bag over and tried to finish off the pack before I caught him. He never usually does that.
1,B&S 12kw standby generator,"this product was receive with three week delay.after install the ATS, we put it to work. the first thing i notice, it burn the three UPS for my server. The product manual from their website said computer friendly, but it is not. My installer test the output, and the frequency is jumping from 50 to 70 hz, voltage drop to 100 to 130. Call B&S; , they said this is how it is. after complain and complain, they keep saying it was not install properly. what a real BS company!"
5,"Wonderful for fine, colored hair!","I have shoulder-length, fine hair. Before buying, I debated spending so much on this Technician shampoo/conditioner, but the ""Best of Sephora"" award convinced me to spend the money to try them. These products are made for color-treated hair (which I have) and protect the color.Well, I absolutely LOVE them both! They do not flatten my fine hair down, and my hair really does look thicker and shinier. Plus, both the shampoo and conditioner are so creamy and rich, you only need to use a tablespoon or so each time you apply. The shampoo lathers up immediately, with only a small amount. And the conditioner is rich, but rinses clean. Due to my hair type, I need to shampoo daily or my hair looks flat. Again, these products are protective, but don't flatten out my hair. I'm in love! TOTALLY worth the money!"
2,Historical value only,"Stowkowski is one of the most renowned conductors, and Symphony No.9 ""From The New World"" is one of the best known classical works.This recording was made in 1927, and the CD was mastered from 78 rpm discs; there are many sonic abberations, despite any restoration that was done.So if you are looking for a stunning performance and recording of this marvelous work by Dvorak, don't buy this.If you are looking for a historical recording that might give you a look into why Stowkowski was so good, to hear the nuances and shadings he gave the piece, and experience this piece as only he could interpret it, then this is a good CD to buy.But don't expect a great, clean recording without mechanical and electronic artifacts."
4,"go ahead, read it... I liked it","The book is well written and captivating. The author invites you into a world that is not well defined in time; you are ushered into a story told by an unnamed young lady who gets married to a rich man whose wife had fairly recently died. The main character, a shy and naive young lady, undergoes quite a transformation not only as she takes in her new role as a wife, but also as she struggles to meet the expectations for someone in her position. Her personal limitations are only a small piece in the puzzle that eventually reveals itself.The story varies in pace. At one point it really picks up and it becomes very hard to put down. I recommend this book; it makes for a good read."
5,The perfect book for a reader who likes romance and suspense,"Rebecca keeps you in suspense, while you feel connected to the characters. Daphne Du Maurier writes it in the main character's view, but also explores many other character's aspects. When I was reading it, I told myself I would read one chapter, but then I would go on to read three or four chapters. I just could not put it down. It is definitely a classic."
5,"Mystery, Suspense, & Romance",I loved this book! If you can get past the boring beginning it is GREAT!
4,Rebecca Review,"Rebecca is an interesting book about a young girl who is pulled form her comfort zone as a companion into the world of the rich and famous. She marries a man named Maxim, who's wife drowned a year before. He can be very ill-tempered but she loves him. She moves to Manderly, an exquisite house just outside of London. She loves it, but she feel that she is in the shadow of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. None of the servants like her either. A boat wrecks in Manderly's bay and while they are checking for leaks they come across Rebecca's boat. There is a body inside! There is then an inquest into how she died. If it was murder, who did it? Was it suicide? Who knows! Read the book and find out, it's worth it!"
1,Do yourself a favor and watch the movie,"I read this book before I watched the movie. I usually like reading books then watching the movie and almost always the book is better, but this time, the movie was so much better! It's probably because I absolutely hated the book. I read it as an assignment for my high school English class over 10 years ago. I chose to read this because my teacher recommended it since I really liked Jane Eyre. Ugh...bad idea! I understand that we all have different tastes in books, so if a spineless, meek, and boring main character is something you'd like then you'd love the book. I hated those qualities about her and the thing is, she never did get a backbone. The book didn't even get interesting until 3/4 in. If I didn't have to read this book, i would've given up on it. If you want to pass through all the boring parts, just watch the movie that was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. You'll thank yourself for it."
3,surprising,"I think it`s a good book. Not the best I`ve ever read, but really good. I like the fact that in the middle of the booky you notice suddenly all is different from what you have thought. I was really surprised that Rebecca was such an unkind person! And that Maxim never loved her. I think the end of the book is also really good, because the whole book deals with events that have never happened when Manderley, Maxim`s house, isn`t so important for Maxim any more. And at the end, Manderley burns down.But sometimes the book is a little boring. There are a lot of long dialogues that aren`t really exiting. They are much too long!But I still liked reading that book."
3,Review for Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier,"I thought this was a pretty average book. It could have been a lot better. I didn't get into it after the first 150 pages because it was extremely boring and there were a lot of random things written in it that didn't need to be in the book because they didn't add to it at all. I skipped a lot of paragraphs and even whole pages because I couldn't stand how boring it was. But as it went on it got a lot better and I became much more interested. It was a good story and must have taken a lot of thought to write. But once in a while it was confusing and I sometimes had no idea what was going on. But overall, I think that I liked it because it really wasn't too bad and I would have given it a five-star rating if it only was more interesting in the beginning."
2,Rebecca,"it was an ok book, it started out really boring and then it got better. it was kinda confusing and i didnt really understand the meaning of it. good luck to you who read it and i hope you enjoy it more than i did"
5,this is one great book!,"i had to read two summer reading books for school and rebecca was thnkfully one. like all school books i thought it would be awful, much to my surprise i loved it. this book is a charming stroy of a woman that marries a rich man whose late wifr suposidly died in a boat accident. all along thw un named woman compares herself to rebecca( the late wife) thinking the oppisit thing than what was the truth. this is a must read i highly suggest it."
4,Interesting,"I found this book very interesting. But sometimes I had problems to understand the context. But we read the book together into the class and so we talked a lot about this book, and I got answers to my questions. The book tells the story of a young poor woman who marries a very rich man. But there's something wrong in the past of her husband called Maxim de Winter. Before he also had a wife, who he had killed. In order to forget his past he married this new wife. They live together happily in his big manor house called ""Manderly"" until someone finds the body of his first dead wife Rebecca. Then the story becomes confused and Maxim has to prove his ""innocence"" My opinion is that Maxim does not use his new wife only for his own good. So when I read the book I was sometimes angry with him. But that's what makes the book interesting. And so I would advise you to read this book. Erika"
3,A VERY SLOW READ!!!,"I don't understand why so many people gave this book five stars. One of the most important things to me in a book is a catchy beginning. This is something this book dfinitely did NOT have. Absolutely nothing happens for the first 230 pages. Then the plot gets interesting and we learn Maxim's deep, dark secret. What I don't understand is why the second Mrs. DeWinter stays with Maxim after finding out what he did. The plot is totally unreallistic, because Maxim asked her to marry him after knowing her for about two weeks. Also, no woman in her right mind would stay with a man who committed murder. And why don't we ever find out the second Mrs. DeWinters's first name? Overall, I really don't recomend this book. I had wanted to read Rebecca for a long time because everyone said it was so good. I must say I was extremely disappointed with the novel. This is a good book to cure insomnia. I hope I have better luck with the movie."
2,Cliched,"The archetype of the buck-fifty romance novel. It's light reading, mildly entertaining, but it's nothing spectacular. It appeals to the weaker sex (make of that what you wish.)"
1,Rebecca. .,Print too small for me to read. Not what I thought I was ordering. I should have returned it. I ordered another copy from Target with normal print.
5,It was the best.,"This novel is about a rich, hansom, man name Maxim De Winterwho has a dark secret about his ex-wife--Rebecca. This novel is about his marriage with his new wife, which is the narrator of the story. Throughout the book, Rebecca's death seem to hunt the whole town espicially Maxim's new wife.This book was fabulous. It was a very interesting,trilling mystery and exciting book. You don't want to put it down.Kelly So"
5,a must read,"this was such a good book! i just couldn't stop reading it! this book ate up all my free time! but i must admit it was well worth it. a great story. this book is what romances should be like, we don't need all those annoying sex scenes"
2,The classic co-dependency novel,"I wanted to take the second Mrs. de Winter, give her a good shake and tell her to get a grip! It's no wonder du Maurier never gave her a name. Anyone with any gumption would have fired Mrs. Danvers after the second encounter, redecorated the west wing, given all those clothes to the local thrift shop, and had a life. Obviously well-written, classic story of suspense, etc, etc, but I had to force myself to finish this book - the heroine is so useless I had no empathy with her at all. And Maxim is another neurotic. No wonder the book is called Rebecca."
4,Great Read from Past Period,"I read this book when I was in my teens, and at that time I found it very suspenseful . . . even though I wondered how and why the young female hero from whose point of view we see the events unfold could be so naive. The naive-woman-in-peril genre doesn't thrill me. Nevertheless, I couldn't put this book down, and I liked the ending, which was a twist upon a twist and very well done. I have no idea what I would think of this book if I read it today, when its style is so passe. I'm glad to see that it's still in print, because it's a classic."
5,"A Wonderful, Intriguing Book","This was such a great book! It started out a little slow, but go so interesting, and though nothing really happened for a while, the words just made you want to read, and read.. Maxim de Winter meets a shy, plain girl who is accompanying an older woman, Mrs. van Hopper, in Monte Carlo. Soon they marry, and she becomes the second Mrs. de Winter, and finds herself living in the shadow of the first Mrs. de Winter, the beautiful Rebecca. Everything about Manderly, the place she lives with Maxim, is how Rebecca wanted it. But Rebecca was killed in a boating accident a year ago. The 2nd Mrs. de Winter is afraid to change anything, because of the sinister Mrs. Danvers, the main housekeeper, who was very fond of Rebecca. But soon the second Mrs. de Winter finds out some things..and learns the secrets of Manderly. The ending was really a surprise, and I loved all of this book. It's a MUST read!"
5,"rabecca, a bok that will never die","Rebecca,by daphne du maurier is certainly a book that will never die, no mater how many times it is read it wil always have that same enchanting magic.It is it that kind of a book,that will always remain close to the readers heart. The story is about maxim de winter,the owner of manderly,a beautiful estate . After the death of his first wife, rebecca, maxim falls in love with the author,and takes his shy bride to manderly again.it is impossible to describe the magical feelings that the book creates. ""she thought rebecca was alive in his heart,she thought that she still reigned over manderly"" it is difficult to describe how rebecca died.Can a dead woman reign over the living.But she did die. she had no power for she was dead.Every reader kills rebecca at the end.Every reader identifies with the author.The magical effect that the book creates however will never die.......it will live forever,read the book to find out more."
4,Very good story about a unique personality and talent.,I really enjoyed this look into Roger Miller's life since I have always been a fan. It is also a good look at his wacky sense of humor - it seems everyone who knew him personally admired him a lot - for his talent and personality.
5,Splendid and Entertaining Music for Children 0-99!,"This music is a must for children 0-99. The songs available for preview were favorites of my own children over 30 years ago. I am thrilled to have this wonderful product still available. This is truly quality entertainment that I will use repeatedly in my own PreSchool classroom. My own grandchildren can also look forward to being entertained by Mr. Hall.Tom T. Hall is really ""tuned-in"" to what can really make people of all ages be happy and not worry."
4,Excellent tension: Interesting and Substantive,"This book is ambitious, and though it doesn't quite live up to its own expectations, it's a great read.Both a character sketch and a workplace mystery, *Anxiety* reminds you how dangerous it can be to take people at face value. Manipulation and office politics are treated with gravity and wit. An excellent and impressive first novel. I will definitely buy Sheehan's next book."
2,"Great Writing, Poor Pacing","I picked this book up while browsing. I flipped through a few pages, liked the crisp writing, flipped again, and still liked the writing. But, much to my disappointment, when I tried to read the book straight through, I found the overall plot to be surprisingly off. Aurelie can clearly frame beautiful sentences, but what happens in the book is helter-skelter (at best), and the secondary characters seem unknowable."
5,"Very interesting, entertaining book",I first read a portion of this book when killing time at Barnes and Noble and decided to come back and order off of Amazon for much cheaper. It was a lot of fun to read and the things I learned have really raised my awareness of how people use body language to communicate - even if they don't realize they are doing it.I recommend this book as it can only help you become more aware of your own body language and the body language of others. I've been able to use things I read in this book both in personal relationships and in the office as well.
4,good book,"this book is a very good experience about gestures ... however, still has some confliction that I cannot really get :""}Book comes with great condition - thanks :""}"
1,Too poorly written to give to a friend with my recommendation.,"I loved Barbara and Allen's two books: ""Why Men Don't Listen >>>""; and ""Why Men Don't Have a Clue >>>"" and gave many copies to friends.BUT, this book on body language is WAY not up to their standards.Sorry. I give it a THUMBS DOWN and donated it to the local library just to keep a guest from picking it up and thinking I had read and liked it."
3,Good reference book,"The book is simple and easy to read. I like how the authors use their references, specially Man Watching. If you have different research based books about body language, this book is useful for quick reviews."
1,"If your looking for tips and hard evidence, keep looking","This book is fun but there are some cultural inacuracies, and a definite Australian slant. There is little scientific information about how to communicate with body language and how to use the body language they describe. All the examples are still pictures of brittish royalty and dated celebrity shots. And while it's nice to see familiar images, not all gestures that people make have a message. Sometimes, one just needs to adjust their tie; they were just unlucky enough to have their picture taken at the same time."
5,I love this book and have referenced it a few times,Easy and fun to read for an instructional book it definitely opened my eyes to body language and taking note ever since I have to say that they are spot on. Very useful.
1,This book is why there needs to be a ZERO star rating,The postulations made by the authors themselves are dangerously unskilled. The book itself is highly outdated. By that I am referring to the fact that the majority of the researched used to bolster the author's opinions are studies/works published in the 50s/60s/70s (for a book written in 2004).There were double contradictions all throughout the book and there was a horrible amount of redundancy that could have been eliminated by an unbiased editor.There are better books out there. And by better I mean more accurate and more widely respected.
5,WOW! This is shiny!,"Starts with beautiful pictures, witty interviews, the script, story boards. Some not so pretty pictures (bad guys). Do not open before seeing the movie, because you will read it and be spoiled. But come home after the movie and enjoy. This is a quality product. I enjoyed the guide to OMWF, but this surpassed that."
5,Finding Serenity,"As a big fan of Firefly and Serenity this book made the sting of not having anymore new episodes to watch a bit less.Beautiful drawings, photos, and plenty of behind the scenes information on the characters and settings made this a treasure.Every Browncoat needs one!"
5,Shiny - Naturally,"I've been wanting this for a while, but in Australia it's double the price for some crazy unfair reason... but I was buying some other stuff on Amazon so took the opportunity to save on postage and got this too - can't wait to spend some time with - I've only had a chance to flip through and read Joss' intro so far but it's good enough that I wanted to come back and comment. If you enjoyed Serenity and/or Firefly - you'll love this, in addition to the script you get a bunch of nice behind the scenes stuff."
5,An excellent lasagna & Enchilada pan,I have been cooking for more than 30 years and have used a lot of different cookware to say the least. However just over 10 years ago I started getting Calphalon for gifts and once I learned the secret to cooking with Calphalon (Preheating the pan) I will not cook with anything else. This lasagna worked so well the first time I used it I went back on line and secured another. Some times people tend to use a pan out side its intended use and are not happy with the performance and in this case I think this to be the case with other reviews. The pan it self is intended for Lasagna and other casseroles for the mid size family and when used properly it preforms flawlessly. I could not possibly be happier and I am sure if used properly so would anyone who adds this pan to their collection.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my son's 5th birthday (who is very mechanically-minded) and am very diappointed that the pieces do not stay together. He can hardly move it or play with it without several of the pieces falling off. It seems too complex for 4+ which is what is says on the box (my husband had to put the whole thing together for him), especially given that the pieces do not stay together well - it ends up being frustrating instead of motivating. On the other hand, my 3-year-old daughter likes playing with the 2 mini-people and animals separately. Overall, we are very disppointed especially for the money...I don't think we'll get much long-term enjoyment out of this one. I liked the concept but after this experience I'm hesitant to try any of the other Gears! products."
2,Poorly Published,"The writings of H.D. are excellent, however the published structure of the essays is deplorable. There are no paragraphs and typos abound on every page, I recommend avoiding this version of Thoreau's writings, as they are very difficult to read."
2,Disappointing.....,"Cinematography is good.... Substance is lite... Music and script is overly dramatic for the events depicted.... I didn't learn that much in watching these.... Expected much more from the way this set was promoted.... Sign me, ""Disappointed""."
3,From back cover:,"Private investigator Kelley Samuels thought her only official business at her friend's wedding was as maid of honor - until all hell broke loose. Sudden blasts of gunfire drowned out the ""Wedding March,"" and Kelley was losing her wrestling match with a lunatic. But, pressed hard against the long, lean body of her rescuer, Griff Bryant, Kelley knew she was in a different kind of danger...Any of the guests could have been the escaped gunman's target, and with a long list of enemies and a young daughter to raise, Griff wasn't taking any chances. He had to hire a bodyguard, and having his body guarded by a petite, armed private eye as she posed as his lover would keep Kelley safe, too - but not from Griff...."
4,Very Good and Very Real,I had no expectations of this movie being any good. I must say after watching it that I thought it was excellent. I thought it was also very realistic in its view of prison life including the Aryan Brotherhood character. It is very scarey in its realism of prison life and also that it in part was based on a true story as another poster said of prison guards staging gladiator fights in Corcoran Prison.Not for kids by any means but very good.
3,Scott's Lady of the Lake,"I purchased this for my husband, and just as a ""to read"" model. It is NOT a collector but is an excellent SOURCE for reading."
4,I love it,Dear Sir/ MadamI love that item. It's good for my studied. I think it good usage for the student.Thank youFrom Sophat UN
5,Best starter book on the market,"This is the book for anyone using 3D Studio MAX for the first time. After completing the first 3 chapters I was able to begin reading (with understanding) the more comprehensive manuals for experienced MAX users. GREAT MANUAL, THANK YOU Michele and company."
4,Fast service,"Was informed that I would receive the product in 10 days and I received it in 4. My only complaint was on the site I was advertised as New and when I got it, it was marked previously used."
2,What were they thinking?,"I saw this movie in April of 2001 and saw the DVD in early October of 2001. This is an average, boring lagging movie that has no meaning or any positive messages for any viewer. Also, the dramatization of conning innocent people is a bad influence for others who want to get easy money."
1,Embarassingly bad,This movie should set women's equality back about 50 years...not to mention portraying men as total saps. How do movies like this--with stars the calibre of Sigourney Weaver and Gene Hackman--get made? Even if it's the only movie on a trans-Atlantic flighte (which is how I saw it)-- READ A BOOK!
2,... not enjoyable,"Jennifer Love Hewitt better be thankful that she is attractive, because she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.Sigourney Weaver is still beautiful at her age, but this was such a demenaing role for her, after all, she is so much better than this movie gives her credit for.Ray Liotta is ridiculous, I think he's been getting type cast a lot since Goodfellas. It's a shame, because he was really good as white bread Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field Of Dreams.Gene Hackman, the best thespian in the film, smallest part, least lines. This is just a travesty. Thought the purple shorts and green socks were hilarious. And the hacking and falling downa lot. Who knew he had it in him.Anne Bancroft: give her more screen time.The story: stupid. Very much like the review said, a female version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with a huge sacrifice in talent... I'm glad I didn't see it in the movie theatres, because it would not have been deemed worth the price of admission. It just stinks."
4,A Great Comedy/Romance Movie!,"Heartbrakers is a great movie about a mother-daughter con artist group. When the daughter falls in love and wants to quit the buisness, she agrees to 1 more con that will give them all the money they'll need to retire. But when the con ends up dead, and a past victem of the girls con's comes back demanding his money back, The daughter must con her love for all he's got! This movie is full of laughs for everyone over 13. You'll love it!"
4,"So funny, it hurts!","Max Conners (Sigourney Weaver) and her daughter Page Connors (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are con-artists where Hewitt's character jeopardizes their latest scam when she falls in love with the owner of a bard that's worth at least $500,000 (played by Jason Lee). I enjoy this movie a lot, like ""Trojan War"" I was laughing at all the hijinks (not to mentioned smiling all the way) throughout the film (when Hewitt appears in her first scene, to the end of the movie).What can I say, I'm big fan of Jennifer Love Hewitt! I admit, however I was kind of surprised with the outfits she and Weaver wore for the film (considering I was so use to see Hewitt as the girl next door thing when she was in ""Party Of Five""). But they both look great nevertheless!"
4,Little dish rack,"This dish rack has worked for me. I have an octagon shaped sink and could not find a dish rack small enough to fit in it. This dish rack works well. Water gathers on the bottom so I do have to empty and clean it, but it's no big deal! It has a sleek modern look to it too. It is not scratching my new sink either which is a big plus!"
2,Too small,"The bottom tray was too small for the dish rack, which itself looked too small to hold any dishes I own. I returned it."
2,I'm lukewarm on this one...,"I bought this to sit in the sink and hold a quick wash worth of dishes from dinner. I doesn't hold thick plates, multiple pots and pans, not any bowls. Well, to be fair, of you are only washing one bowl, or one pan, it would be fine, but nothing will nest together and the silverware holder falls off. The clear tray doesn't have a pour-off area, so it just fills up with water!"
3,COMPACT DISH DRAINER,"IT IS A BIT TOO SMALL ,HOWEVER I TRIED EVERY MAKE AVAILABLE IN THE STORES AND NONE FIT SOOOO THIS ONE IS ACCEPTABLE.. THANKS"
3,item not what was pictured!,"we were thrilled to find this baby car seat at a good price and ordered it, but the one they sent us wasn't what was pictured! it is a more basic model, with no canopy, and was disappointing to my daughter...beware!"
4,The first ass ponys album,"This album, their first, is middle-of-the-road as far as ass ponys cd's go. It is better than their second album,""Grim"", which I have also reviewed. Being next to impossible to find, this well worth the hunt!"
5,High Quality Throughout,"The arrangements are not technically difficult, but they have lots of accidentals and various rhythms that require close and careful reading. Fortunately, the publishers have produced a beautiful volume, with large, almost oversized, easy-on-the-eyes printing set on heavy paper in a lay-flat binding. In other words, the book itself is as elegant as the arrangements it contains. Also included are the original sheet music settings."
3,An interesting approach,"I recently finished reading, ""The Anderson Tapes"", A book I purchased from Amazon.com. This was Lawrence Sanders first book. I found the unique method he used in writing the book - chapters done in report style - entertaining. The book had a good blend of characteriaztion, suspense and dialogue. What I liked the most about the book was, even though most of the chapters were done in a report format, the characters came to life on the page. A tribute to Mr. Sanders ability as a writer. For thoses Lawrence Sanders fans, I recommend you give it a read."
3,disappointed,"The supplier who provides the tools for the belt discontinued sale of them. If the seller of the belt had known the tools weren't available at the time of the order and said so, it would have been good. Now I have to search for a answer for this. I should have returned it, but didn't."
5,Just like Papaws!!!!!!,My 3 year old grandson wants to be just like Papaw. So he had to have a tool belt. He loved it. I received my order very fast and was very satisfied with this item.
5,lost treasure unearthed!,"Barto is so very good; the recording first-rate. Rarely does a product of any type whatsoever provide this magnitude of ""bang for your buck."" Cannot recommend it more highly. I'm just so glad someone has at last dusted off these lovely gems and shone such a radiant light on them.Buy all the volumes - you won't be disappointed.For a full and perhaps fun discussion of this material see my review of Volume I."
3,Lute cd,"soothing, moarnful, but relaxing. Not for everyone, but if you like this kind of thing you will like this cd. Shuffle the cd and it makes things sound even better."
2,Great for Music CD's but falls way short for Data CD's!,"I have been using these CD's for a long time for making backup's and music CD's. They look great and work great for music, but I kept having problems with the data CD's working on my DVD-CD drive on my laptop. I thought it was just my older DVD-CD drive. But then after going to two places to work (I'm a software developer) and the data CD's not working on their drives either, I thought it was the way I was burning the CD's.I did some testing and still did not work. Someone at work suggested for me to try a CD that was not black like these Memorex CD's were. I did and that CD worked fine!Conclusion: These CD's have major problems being read by most common CD and DVD-CD drives. If you want to use them for data... DON'T!"
5,Awesome CD for the money!!,"I was unsure of what performance these cd's would give, but I must say I am happy with these cds.I have a Lite-on drive, and these cds have not dropped a coaster yet. They not only look cool, (I love the black backing) like the playstation cds. I highly reccommend them to any who want new cds. They do cost alot, but they look so cool!!!Later"
2,Demanding,"Only for hardcore oriental meditation practitioners. I found it a bit oppressive after a while and irritating. Maybe, too much of a good thing in a modern day setting."
4,Speechless,"Who cannot love the song ""Only Hope?"" That's got to be the best song on here and it was placed at the greatest moment in the movie. It's a great song and Mandy has a great voice. Just lovely..."
2,Soundtrack omits many songs from movie,"People have the mistaken idea that this was a christian movie, it surely wasn't. Perhaps it's because many rock/alternative songs from the movie were omitted from the soundtrack. Why the Cold song was included is beyond me. I suspect that other than Mandy Moore's fantastic voice and charm, this movie hardly did justice to the book. How come we never saw anyone PRAY in this movie? Not for a miracle, not to give thanks, for the kid in the hospital?? There was alot to PRAY for, but it never happened. This movie is not a christian movie. Sorry."
4,buy it!,"this cd is great, it has different sorts of music so you can listen to it no matter what mood you are in. from punk rocker ( number 11, so what does it all mean, and yes, it is shane west's band! ) to only hope, #6, which is a really beautiful, amazing song. i listen to it every night before i go to sleep and it totaly calms me down. i am addicted to it. switchfoot is really good too, 1 and 3 are both great songs. mandy moore does a really good job. it is definitely worth buying! and see the movie too!"
4,A Pleaser!,"This cd is well worth the money. It is definitely a good CD. Love Mandy Moores ""Only Hope"" and West's ""What does it all Mean"". Awesome CD. Wests song was a complete shocker...loved hearing his voice."
3,Missing Something...,"While the tunes included on this CD are for the most part pretty good, I only gave it 3 stars as it was missing something important, which was the beautiful orchestration in the movie. As a background to the poignant moments, the score was essential and sadly missing on the CD. Pity..."
4,"Rafferty's best work since 1978, perhaps ever","Truly one of Rafferty's finest works, and certainly his most polished. Every track works, and he given the album a distinctive sound by giving in to his Scottish roots. Fans who were won over by City to City will want to hear this as well."
1,Absolutely Worthless !!!!!!!,"It's not possible to give this book a minus 5 STARS!!! This is by far the most wasteful use of paper I have ever seen. If you think you are going to pass this exam with this book you are sadly mistakened. This book is not even close to what you need to study to pass the exam. I bought the book ""Windows 2000 Network Infrastructure Administration by Paul Robichaux and James Chellis"" and passed the exam. I would not recommend this book to anyone. As a matter of fact I have one that you can have for free. I will even pay for shipping."
4,The Best 70-216 - focused Book,"70-216 is the most difficult exam of the 4 core MCSE 2K exams, I bought this book to prepare for it and never regretted it. I got also Sybex and MS Press books but this one is certainly the best. Buy also ""Toubleshooting TCP/IP"" book from the same authors/publisher and you will have no problem with the exam and you will be learning more than just how to deal with the questions on the exam (from those 2 books) even if you're new to this subject. Anything less than 4 stars for this book is unfair in my opinion, this is the book you should get if you're deciding between Sybex/MS-Press etc."
4,The best of the series but not perfect,"This is head and shoulders above the rest of the books in this series.The book fairly thoroughly covers the material tested on the exam. By itself, it may be enough to get you past this exam, the most demanding (in my opinion) of the four. Overall, I was a little troubled by the lack of editing."
2,Don't count on a video,"After reading some of the other reviews, I guess that I should not have gotten my hopes up that I would have a complete set (Rebounder & video). On my 1st shipment, I did not receive a video & did not receive an instructions manual. I spoke to customer service & had to return the original package & re-order another. This one came with a video & manual. I was very excited to give it a try. The ""mega video"" is supposed to be a compilation of several videos from beginner to advanced.When I played the video it was extremely grainy..it looked like a video that had been poorly copied multiple times. The video played the introduction but would not play the individual workouts....I was VERY disappointed. I think that I would really enjoy this rebounder if only the videos worked. I am suprised that Amazon continues to ship this out when they KNOW that there is a problem with the videos."
4,urban rebounder,Fun and not-too-difficult way to exercise. My only complaint is that one or two of the legs get stuck when trying to fold it up after use.
2,Falling apart,"I've had this about a year and a half. It's only been used maybe 20-30 times and all the legs are falling off the springs come undone and have to be put back on everytime you use it. I really liked this at first, but then it started falling apart."
5,Awesome Rebounder,"I am 52 years old and have some joint problems. Also, I've always been a bit clumsy. :-) I've researched exercise equipment and decided that rebounding was the best way to go for me. I found the Urban Rebounder on Amazon.com. The stabilizing bar convinced me to purchase this product. For those who do not need a stabilizing bar, it is easily removed. DVD's came with the purchase and they are fun and easy to follow along with. I started with the beginner workout before I discovered the 'Senior' workout. The Senior workout uses the stabilizer bar, so I primarily am exercising to the Senior workout. I am 100% pleased with the Urban Rebouncer and would recommend it to anyone desiring to purchase an inexpensive way to exercise at home."
2,Safety Concerns and Suggestions,"I have purchased TWO Urban Rebounders. The SAME PROBLEM has occured with both. The TAB(strip) that is attached to the mat and holds the springs, has become detached each time. I used the first rebounder for less than ONE YEAR-it pulled apart in two places. The second UR was used less than THREE WEEKS and became detached also. (My son and I both weigh under 200 lbs., so weight limit is not an issue.)I would like to offer the following SUGGESTIONS: 1. Lengthen the tabs so that they fit further into the mat./or 2. Double the tabs for better reinforcement.I truly enjoyed using the Urban Rebounder and lost weight using it. However, I will not even consider purchasing another one(nor recommend it to anyone else) until this HAZARD is corrected. The breaking of a tab while using the Urban Rebounder IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS."
3,Urban Rebounder,The Urban Rebounder will certainly get your heart rate going. It does have a tendency to come up off the floor but that might just be me and the way I use it. I like having the hold on bar.
3,Fine except for noise,I think it is a pretty good rebounder for the price. I found the squeaking springs too loud.The smell from off gassing is also very strong and did not completely go away even after 30 days.I replaced it with a Bellicon knowing the sound and bounce were important factors for me.
3,production problem?,"I have used this mini trampoline before and wanted to get this as a gift for my active 11 year old son. Upon opening the box on Xmas Day, we realized one of the legs was missing the bracket for the support arm. Odd because the legs come already attached and you just have to move them into place. I would imagine that means even if the company sent me an extra leg with the correct bracket, I would have a tough time attaching it. On the other hand, the company has not answered my email sent on Xmas Day so I am still waiting a reply. I realize its the holidays but today is January 2nd and there is still no answer. I will give it til next week, assuming it will be business as usual in the first full week. Also wish the cushion around the edge was thicker. It is fairly skimpy and my cheaper mini tramp had a better buffer around the edge. Will keep you posted to see if the company rectifies the problem with the bracket."
2,Terrible customer service!,"I recently rec'd the Urban Rebounder. The top of the handle bars, where the padding is, does not fit together. One bar is supposed to fit inside the other and lock. Since the two bars or tubes are the exact same size, one does NOT fit into the other. They are now just hanging in mid-air.I have contacted the company numerous times. They told me to take a picture and e-mail them a copy of proof of purchase, which I did. They said they were unable to download it...so I sent it to several other people, including myself!, and it downloaded perfectly. So I resent it to them 3 times and have yet to receive any response. I have called them twice now. The customer service for this company is terrible. You can see from these reviews how many people have problems with this product."
1,Misleading Advertising Re: Folding/Unfolding Option!,"Be warned the instructions clearly call for two people to open and fold the trampoline, so for those of you who live alone, you are out of luck.And trying to handle it yourself is a dangerous proposition, not at all recommended.The product should be re-designed so it is easier to open and fold, and the advertising should make the ""two person"" requirement very clear."
1,Too Good to Be True,"Let me start by saying that this equipment is really, REALLY fun. I jumped for about 1.5 hours the first day I got it. Along with three DVD's and fitness bands, it seemed like a great deal.I ignored the fact that the spring cover was ripped when the item arrived. I also ignored that springs kept coming unhooked and are damned hard to hook back. But, then the mat broke. On the first day. The mat ripped and a spring flew off, and this time no amount of grunting and groaning was going to get it stretched back into place (the section connecting the mat to the spring was torn completely free). Poor craftsmanship that I will now have to PAY to return.I would have really loved this item if it hadn't been constructed so poorly.Edited to say: Amazon gave me a full refund. I love Amazon so much."
2,Toxic outgassing of materials,"While I thought the product was high quality and strong, the outgassing was incredibly toxic. HSN, where I bought it, said they had never heard of this before, however, when I contacted Urban Rebounder, they did acknowledge that they've had complaints occasionally. The solutions didn't work for me, so they did take the product back. I appreciate the excellent customer service, and I hope this issue can be remedied, because I think it's a great product and a great way to bring up heart rate and have fun while doing so."
5,"You're planning something, aren't you Nemoto?","Fascinating, unputdownable space opera yarn. Certainly has its weaknesses, characterisation is maybe not so strong, and the much vaunted ""hard science"" still relies on ""deus ex machina"" plot devices such as stargates (!) and miracle anti-ageing treatments not seen since the old testament. However, the ""idea density"" is so high that you would expect some duffers. Also, since I stayed up til 340am to finish it, I have to give it 5 stars! Author's misanthropic, Malthusian outlook does become a bit tedious at times but overall great speculative fiction.Incidentally, I have not read part 1 (Manifold: Time) and as far as I can see Manifold: Space is self-contained, however other readers who have read both may like to comment on this."
2,Amateurish,"Having read all of the hullabaloo on the back cover, I was suprised by the amateurish writing within. The main redeeming qualities of this book are in the scientific ideas it contains, which are pretty interesting. The story itself is poorly written."
4,An enjoyable read,"I purchased this book on a visit to Catalina Island, and finished it before our boat returned to the mainland. It is a very enjoyable read, with wonderful historical photographs to help you picture the situations they are discussing.It is up to the reader to decide if they believe the stories presented here. If you have an open mind and are willing to entertain the possibility, you will enjoy the book. The added bonus, is that you also learn a lot about the history of this charming island."
3,Zeitgeist,"Zeitgeist being the latest release from Smashing Pumpkins is an alright release that gets a bit too political. It seems like almost all major artists do it these days. Madonna on Hard Candy, Sherryl Crow on Detours and now Smashing Pumpkins on Zeitgeist. To be honest it sounds just as trite, forced and pretentious when either of them do it. To think that this the same group the recorded Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness with truly classic tracks as ""Tonight, Tonight"" or ""1979"" makes it painfully clear that this is not their best work. Even if one compares with the earlier ""Siamese Dreams"" then one is reminded that they can do so much better then this. ""Doomsday Clock"" is an ok but it lacks the SP aura of earlier releases. 3/5."
1,This album sucks,"This is by far the most pathetic reunion album in the last 10 years. Pure Garbage from the fathers of gay goth, emo gayrock."
4,"This album rocks, and so do the new Pumpkins","I was skeptical about a Pumpkins album done without James and Darcy, but this rocks. It's in heavy rotation on my CD player (both in the house and in the car, and that's saying something - my other CDs sit in one place). As for the band, I caught one of their Fillmore shows in SF - they were tight and strong on both old and new material, and even played some songs better than the original group, especially tracks from Machina (Heavy Metal Machine was amazing in concert). Billy Corgan still has it as a singer/guitarist/songwriter, and Jimmy Chamberlin is one of rock's best drummers. Buy this album, you'll enjoy it."
3,"Not bad, but Iha and Darcy are clearly missing","I'm a huge pumpkins fan, so of course I was eager to get their latest record. It definitely has some rocking riffs (Billy and Jimmy know how to do that!) but I feel like overall most of the songs are more atonal and purely rhythmic and lack the roundness and fullness of say Mellon Collie or Siamese Dream. It's alsmost as if not having James Iha and Darcy is limiting the music--even though Corgan was always the major creative influence--when it's just Billy and Jimmy, it sounds like, well just Billy and Jimmy. Worth picking up if you're a fan, but I didn't hear anything that makes me think ""this is up there with my other favorite sp songs""."
4,New review in an unique-word... now 4 stars!,"Okay, I've made the old mistake when we talk about Smashing Pumpkins... SP are not something trivial, as usual... I should listen more times...1.Doomsday Clock- Energy. 9/102.7 Shades Of Black- Wow!!! 10/103.Bleeding The Orchid- Fantastic. 10/104.That's The Way (My Love Is)- Good. 7/105.Tarantula- Amazing!!! 10/106.Starz- Noisy. 6/107.United States- Horrible. 1/108.Neverlost- Melody. 9/109.Bring The Light- Jimmy. 9/1010.(Come On) Let's Go!- So so. 6/1011.For God And Country- Art. 10/1012.Pomp And Circumstances- Beautiful. 8/10"
3,Eh,"Eh...Goo Goo Dolls blew me away last year with ""Let Love In."" I was hoping for more of the same from Smashing Pumpkins. Nope. For hard-core fans only."
4,Nice to have them back,"I, too, had some questions at to how much of a ""Smashing Pumpkins"" album this was going to be with only two of the original members. Even in the ""old days,"" however, Corgan really was the band (I think he always performed almost all the studio tracks except the drums). I stopped listen to Pumpkins after ""Siamese Dream"" so I have probably missed part of the evolution of their sound.As a fan of ""Gish"" and ""Siamese Dream"" I think Z is a different sound (but not radically so). Overall, I really like Zeitgeist. Maybe it is a cash-grab to milk the old fan-base but I can live with that. Most of the songs are pretty solid even if somewhat mellow and a touch pop-ish. Personally, I'm glad to have the Pumpkins back.Recommended."
4,its cool,I have personally never bought a Smashing Pumpkins cd myself. But for some reason i felt interested enough to buy this one and see what its all about. I dont think i got a whole lot of insight into them as a band. But i do have a better idea now of what they like and bring to the table. I find myself thinking about buying something from earlier in their career 1st or 2nd album maybe. So that way i can make a much more informative review.I will say that i enjoyed the following tracks on ZeitgeistThat's The Way (My Love Is)TarantulaStarzBring the Light(Come On) Let's Go!I didnt really care for the last 2 songs that much...it felt real broading and preachy which i have never been a fan of. Enjoyed the rest of the cd though and might look to getting another one of theirs in the future.
1,The first terrible Smashing Pumpkins album.,"There's nothing to find here even close to the quality of any previous Smashing Pumpkins Album. United States has got to be the worst track I've ever heard. But a lot of great bands have had that bad album someplace. I hope the pumpkins get back into the studio to record something that rocks. This one will find some fans, and others will leave it behind as I will."
2,Not the right software,"It was my impression that this was a software program that had recipes to be used with Pumpkins. I tried to follow it but there is just some guy whining with a lot of buzzing noises in the background, and even at times what sounds like Zombies eating something. This software has nothing to do with Pumpkins and the booklet does not seem to have any ingredients even listed in the instructions. Very upset and I am returning this product immediately."
3,"What I expected, which was not much.","I have been a huge fan since day 1, but I think Billy is moving away from where I am musically. Some good guitar work, but too much mosquito-boy vocalizing. Instead of just rocking out, he's trying to sound profound, and missing. Let the Smashing Pumpkins die."
1,Yawn!,Want to know what the sound of a desperate mid-life crisis sounds like with guitars? Just listen to Zeitgeist.
2,The Problem with Sequels,"I liked First Evidence. But if I'd wanted to read it again, I would have. Outer Perimeter was little more than a re-hash with a subplot woven in. I'm a big fan of episodic fiction - following the same characters through DIFFERENT stories - with little or no reference to previous events. However, I had the feeling throughout Outer Perimeter that I was reading the next few chapters of First Evidence. It had very little of its own plot. When I got to the end just to discover the story lines, such as they were, weren't even resolved, I just had to throw up my hands. It's my guess the next in the ""series"" will be another weak subplot with the bulk of the book simply re-hash of the first two."
3,Not comfortable on the face,The rims and wrap-around pieces are significantly thicker than I thought from the photo. I found them uncomfortably thick and tend not to wear them as a result.
3,"Fine safety glasses, not perfect","These are just what they look like. They fit comfortably and don't slip. As for complains, I didn't like the lenses. Mine are clear, so possibly other shades are different, but the ones that I have don't have any sort of non-reflective coating. They are also not polarized. So there is some internal reflection and the objects you look at don't appear as sharp as I would've wanted them to. Also, the glasses don't fit well over the earmuffs. For the latter issue, most safety glasses of this design will not fit over the earmuffs, but given that these were supposed to be designed for shooting sports, it is only fair to expect that they would. Thus my 3-star rating: -1 for internal reflection in the lenses and -1 for not fitting over earmuffs."
4,Great for dark cycling,"I bike commute 12+ miles every day thru Seattle rain and in the dark. I needed a lens that didn't mute light and that didn't fog up. These definitely fit the bill for the price. They do fog a bit when it's 100% humidity and I'm working hard, but most any would. The amber lens actually enhances contrast on overcast days or even night riding. They do turn all lights yellow, which seems weird at first but you get used to it. The rubber nose bridge and ear temples are nice and they are fairly comfortable. They are made in Taiwan. I would love if they were polarized or made in the USA, but I'm sure that would raise the price quite a bit."
1,Not Much of a Checklist,This book focuses too much on the older tradional weddings. I don't feel that couples today can really benefit from this book. It's a good starter if you can't find anything else. I highly recommend Pamela Thomas's Bridal Guide.
3,not the best,"I wasn't totally impressed with this book. It definately has some good points and advice and there is information to be learned, I just thought it was average in the format."
4,Chet Baker Live at Gaetanos,"This CD is a gem. Beautiful solos by Chet Baker on fluegel horn, Dave Mackay on piano, and Phil Urso on sax each with his own style. Hard to believe these guys were all struggling jazz musicians in 1966. Taped by drummer Harry Keevis on a reel-to-reel tape machine nestled among his drums."
1,Doesn't do much!,Maybe good enough when you need a quick pep talk. Hardly anything new or interesting. Don't waste your money.
4,Carnivale Season 1 Review,"Carnivale Season 1 tells the story of Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl),a young man with no family and a shady secret lurking in his closet. Ben is rescued from the end of his road by the Carnivale, a rag tag bunch of circus folk, as they make their way acorss the western US during the dust Bowl years of the thirties. Along the way you get a roller coaster ride as you discover more about the Carnies and the reason why they were passing through that way in the first place. Carnivale is a rich series set in a poignant era when hope and despair were fighting in every heart. Add in lots of dark noir style and some mystical dilemmas and you have a great first season that will have you wishing you already had the second one in your collection."
5,great show,very entertaining i would buy it again. sweet baby j they make you type a certain amount of words...how much to they expect me to say?????
4,"Creepy, gripping series - great characters!",This series is set in the Mid-west during the Dust Bowl / Depression in the late 1920's. The characters are great and the story is very gripping....there are elements of supernatural and religious symbolism....great acting and the characters are excellent. I love this series - too bad it was only on for 2 seasons!
5,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite shows of all time, and is perhaps one of the best I have ever seen. I am still baffled as to why it would have been cancelled after only two seasons, but this was during a time when HBO always cancelled their best shows.It takes place during the Dust Bowl, and revolves around the lives of carnival members and a Methodist preacher's life. The cinematography is beautiful, and the actors are wonderful. The main character is Ben (played by Nick Stahl), whom the carnival picks up after his mother's death. He has the power to heal things, which the carnival members discover early on, and try to exploit. There are many other notable characters, all of whose lives you will become deeply involved in.I grabbed it right away on prime, mainly because it is hard to find the box dvd set in my area, and much more expensive than the 18.99 I had to pay for it through Amazon. It is fairly cheap to buy both seasons, and you will not regret it."
2,wonderful but cheap made,"I love this product but it is very cheaply made, quit in the middleof my love session. Suction is wonderful if made better"
4,"Jack Radics, From the Roots!","Jack Radics is one of the many ""underestimitated"" talents in Reggae Music. I have owned this cd three different times over the almost 10 years since it was released, and with songs such as ""Purify"" ""Open Rebuke"", and the addition of Yami Bolo, this is my ""Praise"" and ""Meditation "" cd. Jack Radic's vocals lend the perfect touch to make this a true ""Roots"", Rasta, Nyabinghi classic! What a way to musically experience the Proverbs and Psalms! Jah Love, Keturah J."
4,meditation cd,"Helpful for relaxing for meditation and stopping internal chatter. Not as good as the Tibetan Singing Bowls, for me, but better than the OM chanting."
1,worst tool ever,"unfortunatly I purchased this tool on June 17th and was so excited to try it out when I finally did it did not do what the reviews and demonstration claimed. Paint was all over my ceiling. so I tried it again just above the molding cause I thought I was doing something wrong, but again the paint went all over the top of the molding. I got so fustrated I just threw it in a box. Went to home depot and bought the flat edger which works just fine. I would love my money back but Im sure this is impossible. So disappointed.this is my reviewThanksTerrence"
2,Taylor 49562,"Bought this to hang on tree close to house. Very disappointed in quality of product. Cheap materials to hang it by (Probably won't last through Chicago winter). No covering for workings of thermometer, so spiders and ants get in. Disappointed in quality of a Taylor product. On the plus side - is large and easy to read."
1,terrible picture quality and sound,"This dvd is worthless i will never watch it again the picture quality is like from the 70's sound on my grande utopia and halcro dm88 is terrible ,it is not what i expected at all !!!"
1,WEB Griffin fan,"The works of WEB Griffin are great, I have read all his books numerous times. Trying to market abridged versions of his books is a sham. You cannot take a book normally requiring 11 or 12 CD's and condense it to 3 CD's without loosing 75% of the story line. Poor decision on the publisher's part for producing it and on Amazons part for selling it."
3,DVD with VHS quality ...,"This DVD had been introduced in 2005 according to the package note, but the sound and image quality are so poor as if they were ripped from VHS counterpart produced earlier.And if you are a technology geek and buying this product hoping you can put your hands on some cutting-edge technologies, forget about it.This is all about the images and history, not about how it works, I mean, it's more like a History channel thing than a Discovery channel type.Making things even worse, although the running time is approximate 60 min. or so, 10-20% of them are just repetitions with different narrations or music.I graded this DVD with 3 stars only because of the price.If it's more than $30, definitely out of the buying list."
3,It good,This book is a fantastic journey from jeans life in China to her grandmas house in the united states. Her life is interesting and there are joyful times and hardships along the way.
5,well written,"This books gives you great information and is written in an easy way, you don't need to be a proffesional to understand it"
2,A 3/4 Fan,"I absolutley loved this book!However, I have a major beef with the trilogy.3/4 of this trilogy is great, however all of the books were completely ruined when the tanks and armed soldiers showed up.I hate it when fantasy writers try to merge the modern world with a fantasy world. I see it as the worst cop out, perhaps even worse than the ""it was only a dream"" ending.If they could have just changed this one thing, this would have been so much better."
1,Why didn't I give up on reading this sooner?,"I read Forging the Darksword, Doom of the Darksword, and finally Triumph of the Darksword, wanting to know how it would come out, and hoping, expecting, that it would get better. It did not. The pace drags, the plot fails to hang together, and the characters fail to become real. It was a waste of time reading these, when I could at least have been rereading other, better books in this genre."
3,Where are the mummies?,"The publisher should have retained the original title of this anthology, which was Stories To Be Read With The Door Locked, Volume II. Only two tales, Pipe Dream by Alan Dean Foster and Shottle Bop by Theodore Sturgeon, really come close to delivering the chills promised on the cover. The remaining tales are a mixed bag of Cold Era thrillers (View by Moonlight and The Odor of Melting), crime and suspense stories (Coyote Street, The Pattern, and The Income Tax Mystery) and old fashioned whodunnits (There Hangs Death! and The Affair of the Twisted Scarf). Nonetheless, it contains a pretty impressive sampling of familiar names - Rex Stout, Bill Pronzini, Edward Hoch, and Joseph Payne Brennan, to name but a few. Fans of the Alfred Hitchcock and Ellery Queen Mystery Magazines will enjoy these old chestnuts."
5,Mr. Ed Van Denburgh,"I am very happy, I have tried at least a ten different stores and was unableto obtain them, I came upon them by searching the web, and Amazon had them.Please advise me if them become scare...Thank You for the quick service..Please do not use VANDY in the revew, I tried to edit itand couldntED"
5,Help for parents with children of any age,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. What a wonderful book for all parents. It is well written, easy to follow and easy to read. I cannot express my thankfulness enough. This book has helped me so much in parenting!"
2,What the heck happened to the production?,"The only reason I'm giving this album a 2 instead of a 1 is because I think under all that muddy noise is some real good music. If I set my EQ just right I can hear something that sounds good. It might just be in my imagination but I can't fault the band completely for a bad production house. But, like the title says, this CD has HORRIBLE, DEPLORABLE, TERRIBLE, SAD, MISERABLE production quality. There are some CD's you buy that sound good on only certain types of stereo equipment. This cd sounds TERRIBLE on all configurations. The only album that I can think of that has just as bad if not worse production quality is ""St.Anger"" by Metallica, but at least Nevermore's music is still good, so that's the upside. Please Nevermore, if you are reading any of these reviews, I'm almost positive that your songs are awesome. Please produce another CD. We won't think any less of you!!! I just want to hear these awesome tunes. :("
3,Enemies of Me too,"I can't say enough good things about Nevermore. But this album was published on Magic Arts Publishing (never heard of them and don't want more). It's not a bad album, it's just bad for a Nevermore album. So if you're a depressive individual, possibly goth chick or goth guy (who's still straight as an arrow of course) check it out. Oh yeah, the music's good too. Hope that doesn't turn you away from this band."
1,NU METAL DISSAPPOINMENT,"I REMEMBER THAT IN THE EARLY 90S THERE WAS A BAND CALLED SANCTUARY COMPOSED BY TWO OF NEVERMORE MEMBERS (Warrel Dane, Jim Sheppard). DID YOU KNOW THAT SANCTUARY BROKE UP BECAUSE WARREL AND JIM ACCUSED THE OTHER MEMBERS OF ""SELLING OUT"" AND NOT PLAYING ""TRUE"" METAL. WELL, WHO WOULD HAVE GUESS THAT ALMOST 10 YEARS LATER, NEVERMORE WILL BE ""SELLING OUT"" TOO AND RECORD ONE OF THE WORLD'S DISSAPOINMENT."
4,The Sound Quality Is Fine,"I really don't get why everyone's complaining about the sound quality. It sounds perfectly fine to me. If you want bad sound quality, I suggest listening to ""Reek Of Putrefaction"" by Carcass, ""Scum"" by Napalm Death, and ""Mortal Massacre"" by Mortician.Besides the impeccable sound quality, the music is very solid and I consider this to be my favorite Nevermore album. I especially like ""Enemies Of Reality""; ""I, Voyager""; ""Never Purify""; and ""Tomorrow Turned Into Yesterday""."
3,good games,"I liked the games themseves but found it confusing and hard to understand the instructions.Great graphics but each game takes too long to set up and play,not like Micro Softs Combat Flight sim."
5,The Definitive Collection,"This box set celebrates the long career of the original guitar god, Eric Clapton. It traces his history back to the days of The Yardbirds, his time with John Mayall, Cream and Blind Faith, and his solo career. Over eighty cuts on four albums provide a great sampling of Slow Hand's evolution of sound and playing. This is still one of the best box sets that I've found, covering all of his greatest hits. Of course, Clapton has so many great hits, that it requires a second box set to cover them all."
5,Great stretch assistant!,This is a great product!! Foam is very sturdy and doesn't bend under weight. Would recommend to anyone! Very satisfied!!
1,Not durable surface,"The firmness is softer than Power-system's EVA foam roller. The surface does not have any protection, so it is easier to be scratched and damaged. For this quality, the product price does not make me happy. I am very disappointed."
4,Great!,"Bought to stretch by IT band...helping quite a bit :)Also has many more exercises to do which I haven't tried yet, but plan to. Isn't so big that it takes up a ton of space, can fit in a closet, corner, etc."
3,Stinky,"The roller is super firm, but has a very unpleasant odor, I had hoped to use it as a bolster pillow, but it is too firm for that, so I use it for floor exercises (what it was designed for.) However, the odor forces me to keep it in the garage."
2,Funk Classic CD,Its ok I have heard better CDs !!! Put together than this! Although the songs r good on this cd there is a mixture ofEverything!! KC
3,I was ashamed to read it!,"Yeah, it was trashy, but I got it for 2 bucks. The girls in the book try to come of as these poor mistreated soles, when they are really just sluts and whores. The Johns wouldn't be Johns without sluts like them. They are using each other. But hey, it was very interesting. And I read the sequel too."
3,Didn't like Goldilocks' Facial Expressions,"After reading the other reviews, I chose this version of the classic tale. Although I like the book fine, it is a little too wordy for my taste, although what I really don't care for are the facial expressions of Goldilocks. I like all the other illustrations fine, except for most of those of Goldilocks' face. In some of the illustrations her face looks like an adult and in others her face looks like she is mentally disturbed. I think it every time we read it to our daughter."
4,"Nice laptop, but screen specs are in error","For those shopping by spec, for some reason the LCD specs are messed up in many sources, including Amazon currently. Just looked at models in a store, and neither the 2710 nor the 2715 have ""native"" 1600x1200 LCDs. The screens are 1400 x 1050. There is indeed a setting for 1600x1200, but this merely allows the 1400x1050 screen to pan across the larger area.You may also want to know that the 2715 has 16M video RAM vs the 2710's 8M, which woudl be important if you are expecting to use dual-monitor desktop mode."
1,You cannot learn Java in that short time,"not upto mark as java beans java servelets and JDBC should have been included atleast at awareness level. Book can be made expensive and nunber of pages can be increased . you can do more in 24 hours. Concept is excellent maybe they can have two different editions one in a handbook format for quick and lightning tour, second covering java 1.2 atleast the concepts clearly."
5,Autobiography of a thinker,"Perhaps the lure of this title is unusual. However, the book is a classic. I read it when I was too young to understand it well, now I am listening to my husband as he is reading it and finding that I want to re-read it myself."
4,"Beautiful, if flawed.","This autobiography of the early years and conversion to Catholicism of the Trappist Monk Thomas Merton is highly engaging and often quite beautiful in it's descriptions of the value of faith and the the importance of a contemplative life. What I found difficult was the constant condescension toward other faiths, which seemed very strange for a man who would become a champion of ecumenicism, and who wold die decades later on a tour of Asia, where he addressed an interfaith conference of monks.I was glad to learn later that Merton said he regretted much of this book, and for my own enjoyment I will assume it is this over-eagerness of a recent convert that he regretted.Beyond this one complaint I can say that it is a beautiful book with value beyond the Catholic world, as well a good introduction to Merton."
4,"Literature, Theology, and Autobiography","Part literary analysis, part theological speculation, and largely spiritual autobiography, this 467 page tome is a much easier read than one might initially expect. There were times when, as a non-Catholic, I got bogged down in some of the particulars of the tradition, but much of the book has a universal appeal. The Seven Storey Mountain tells of Merton's journey from agnosticism to Catholicism, from self-absorbed young man to contemplative monk. The work is well enough written to have captured the imagination of countless readers, and it has even been translated into 20 languages. The Protestant reader may be either annoyed or amused (depending on his personality) by Merton's jabs at Protestantism. He does, however, have the magnanimity to frequently compliment Protestants for having ""at least that much of religion."""
5,to build on life's meaning,"what a magnificent 462 page autobiography!written in 1948 , this book will not appeal to the masses but should.the story of Thomas Merton who scaled the seven storey mountain [the deadly sins]and climbed the spiritual and mystical heights with all humility.will be especially satisfying to those familiar with the peggy lee classic ""Is that all there is?"" one book that will take you to a different level of religious and spiritual experience beyond that! this classic can of course be found at amazon. whatever the price , you will gain more than amazon."
4,Rich Maristed,"I am an admirer of Kai Maristed's work. She is a terrific writer who makes you share the emotions of her characters. She paints vivid verbal portraits of people and landscapes of places, sometimes, as in this novel especially, surreal."
3,Disappointment reigns,"I wanted to like this ""pure"" version of Trovatore, but I was disappointed. Maybe I'm a heathen, but I'm a sucker for the ringing high C's of Franco Corelli and the melting lyricism of Leontyne Price. I found Licitra's Manrico bland and plodding and Frittoli only servicable. The exciting part for me: Muti's vigorous tempi and the Azucena of Urmana (in 10 years, she'll be giving Giulietta Simionato a run for the money). I'll add these CDs to my collection."
1,All fluff and no meat make this physics book useless,"This book takes an exhustive amount of time describing models of physical phenomena, and then briefly mentions the physics behind the models. This is entirely insufficient for learning physics. It helps not only to grasp the concepts of physics, but understand the mathematics that underly those concepts. This book seems to gloss over those mathematics entirely, and for this reason the book is useless. Avoid this ""physics"" book at all costs."
5,Chose rating because,"I chose this rating because I received the product on schedule, and it looks to be in good shape. I have not listened to it since it is a Christmas gift for a friend."
3,not bad for pet hair,"I purchased this vacuum for cat fur removal from my couch and the kitties beds. It works okay, but is a bit awkward to use with the pet hair brush attachment. It's not a solid connection and moves up and down, which makes it more difficult to use. I would have preferred it to be stable. Still, it works better than my canister vacuum, so I would recommend it. It's powerful and the suction is very good. It's just that cat fur is very hard to clean from the type of materiel of which my couch is made."
4,Great!,This works wonders! I did have to spend a little more time getting the dog hair off the couch but it does a great job. I def. recommend it.
3,Not as good as expected,"This little machine is powerful and convenient to use -- easy to empty, etc. However, the brush is pretty much useless. I bought this cleaner to try to keep up with cat hair on my sofa and in my car (gets carried there on my clothes). In both cases, the end of the hose is much better at picking it up than the brush. The brush seems to distribute the suction so it's nearly non-existent. There's no convenient way to stow the cord other than wrapping it around the body of the tool. Although there's a built in clip near the plug that is made to secure the end of the cord, there are no prongs or hooks to wrap it around. That said, it does the job I intended, just not as elegantly as I'd hoped!"
