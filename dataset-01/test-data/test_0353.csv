1,Terrible rip-off,"Don't buy this thing. Get Wembley or On Fire or either Greatesthits collection or Freddie Mercury's Solo collection...or even'The Three Amigos'...just don't get this.I'm a liberal democrat, but whoever put this mess togethershould be publicly flogged.But major thumbs-up to Amazon for posting the unfavourablereviews without flinching. I've adored absolutely everythingelse I have ever gotten from them."
5,Not your father's Government,"Mr King tells a story about what happens when the government does what it wants without any one watching. How many other stories are out there like this one, but nobody made it back? Having worked with ""SF"" people that have worked with Mr. King and Marchinko it is very easy for me to believe this happened."
1,"Long time, no hear","Hey ""Chance"", long time no see. Ladies and Gentlmen, I know this guy and I've heard all these stories before. This is a ""never made it there"" Private with too much barstool time. It's what you get when you cross the fiction of Rambo with the reality of Norm and Cliff at ""Cheers."" ""Chance"", I know where you drink Corona (or are you back to Stoli in a Chimney?), and if you make money off of this, I'll come slap you off that barstool and take my money back."
5,The BEST,Everything is in the case you need except the 20 gauge. Which we bought one for the kit. Now we have everything to clean our guns with. We can take it with us to clean them where ever we Cowboy shoot.
2,not worth the trouble,"the simple old fashion rod style of cleaning is a whole lot simpler and easier. this package comes with hardly any instructions,to many attachments and parts that i""m sure you'll need that are easy to lose. i should have returned it on sight instead of trying to clean my lever action 22 henry rifle!!!"
1,I was brain dead to buy this junk,"Cleaning a .223 barrel, I used 2 patches, it worked well, 3rd one was a bit too large and got stuck in the barrel. I can't push it out because the wire flexes. Still trying to figure out how to get out of this pickle; I tried to burn the patch it doesn't burn because of the oil. I wasn't planning to buy a new barrel but it looks like I'll have to because of the Otis ""most advanced cleaning system"". I wish I bought a carbon fiber cleaning rod as I was initially planning..."
2,Do we need another potted compilation?,"I have many other books on the great man himself. Along comes this ""must-have"" book and I plonk down my money. Afterwards, I realise that many of these maxims and one-liners are already embedded in my other books. The truly bad thing about books like this is that it takes things out of context.It is probably a great read for business managers."
1,what a rip off,I'm a hairdresser and not only is it hard to use on yourself but it's equally hard to use on someone else. It truly sucks.
5,Looking for this book,"I've been trying to get ahold of this book for YEARS!!! I started reading them when I was in 4th grade (I'm now finishing my 2nd year in college) and reread the entire series every summer. I have looked for this book for years because I want to know how the series ends. If anyone has any idea where I could get my hands on it, that'd be fabulous! I've even tried contacting the author, but haven't had any luck!"
4,A book for Understanding,"This book I read when I was a very young woman. Today many might think it not worth reading because they have so much to see and learn by TV or I-pod, or some other ""techi' input. However this is by the first person who had the nerve to ""come out"" and get on with what they thought need to be said and done to make a happy life during those times. What ""guts""!I hope some people will take the time to read this book and know it was history made, that needed to be made so those today have pics and writen history to gain knowledge from. I wish she were alive today to know what she started, and how things have changed for the better in most cases.This was a gift for a friend who is in their 80's and wanted to reread it from long ago."
5,Excellent product!,"This is an excellent product for my cat with a history of strivite crystals. Unfortunately, it's his brother that thinks these tablets are kitten crack. He goes crazy for them, so I shake the bottle when he won't come inside, and then he comes running! Highly recommend, especially if you can't afford the vet's $60 a bag prescription food. Just give your cat this and purina one urinary."
2,My kitties don't like it! :(,"All four of my cats won't touch the tablets. I have to grind them up (difficult to do) and mush it into their food to get them to eat it. They'll only accept so much of it in their food as well, it looks like they're only getting about 3/4 of a tablets' worth a day - below the recommended dosage unfortunately. Would be nice if they sold this in either a powder or liquid form!"
3,havent tried it yet,"It wad quick shipping, but I havent actually used the product once since I bought it. My cat had a bladder infection and needed medication, but I am planning to see if it maybe works as a preventive."
5,Truth Coming Out,"This is an amazing and brutal movie. It is an ongoing effort over the last few years to show the suffering that has occurred in the North of Ireland. Of course, being part of the Criterion Collection assures top quality with even a detailed booklet included. If you have any interest in ""The Troubles"" (at least from the Nationalist side) you should see this one. Little pricey but worth the dollars."
1,Give us Jablonsky's score for this movie!,"The minute after we came out of the theater from seeing The Transformers, my brother and I went into a music store so we could buy Steve Jablonsky's score from the movie. We were mortified to discover that the only music available from the film is the rock songs, played throughout. Granted, a FEW of the songs are good, but...The score for The Transformers is one of the most amazing film scores I've ever heard! It's absolutely heinous that it's not available to buy! (A little drama in this case is called for, in my opinion.) It needs to be, FAST!Give us Jablonsky's score for The Transformers!!!"
1,Don't bother.,"I can't say i hate the soundtrack, but I can say its not worth the money. The only three songs of worthiness are:What Ive DonePretty Handsome AwkwardBefore its To LateJust go on Limewire and search those and your set. Save your money for the Score Soundtrack. I don't know when it will be released but most scores come out 2 weeks to a month after Theater release so keep an eye out for it towards the end of July, but I could be wrong. I heard the score is still being worked on for the soundtrack so don't quote me on the release."
1,Not a movie soundtrack,Saw the movie and it was awesome. Not just the special effects but the music and orchestration that was part of the movie. None of which is on this CD laughingly called a soundtrack CD for the movie. I'd give it a zero-star if I could.
2,TF Soundtrack,"The music on this is ok, if you're a head banger or like heavy metal but let me be clear on one thing. IT IS NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED A SOUND TRACK TO TRANSFORMERS. Only one song comes close to being respectable and pays homage to the original TF Movie, it's the Theme song which was not in the movie.....don't know why. Its pretty good."
2,Don't Give Up - There Is Something Else!,"I have to say, after going to see the movie myself, I was excited about the soundtrack since I am a colletor of movies soundstracks. I looked this CD up and was very dissapointed to find that this was not what I was looking for at all. Since I can not say what program I used but I'm sure you can guess; I tried to find something - anything on the movie. Instead I came across The Transformers Game OST 2007. I have to admit, this is a really good selection of music and it's very close to the movie. In fact, it's as close as your going to get before the score comes out. This Game OST is worth downloading if you have the proper program or simpley buy it offline becasue it's not very hard to find. I promise you will like it. So don't give up, download this for the time being and keep your fingers cross for the relese on the movie score soon. ^ ^"
1,Where's the Score??,"I've always wondered what the point of a soundtrack was if it hardly had any music from the original film. This is yet another example of that. Steve Jablonsky did an amazing job at creating the score for this movie. The diversity of themes throughout the movie was superb. To make a soundtrack with none of his music on it is a real shame, especially when there's not a separate score available."
1,Where is Steve Jablonsky?!!!!!,"I just got done watching the 'Transformers' film. I was blown away by not just the movie but the film score by Steve Jablonsky. Absolutely amazing! I came to check out the soundtrack and what do I find? Not ONE track from the score. Instead, half the songs on the album are not even featured in the film. Wow. What's the deal? I really do hope a score recording will be produced soon because it was awesome! By the way, the movie is a must-see!"
1,Just wanted to vent and register my disappointment,"I agree with everyone - the music in the movie was great! I saw it twice so far in a week. Gave me chills, which is cool - not many movies do these days.I wanted the music, and it's NOT on the soundtrack?!?!? I didn't buy this, just listed to samples of[...].Which I could rate this a ZERO."
2,Score coming Oct 9,Just browsing around the future releases section and the Score comes out Oct. 9. Hope that helps..
1,iTunes,"Save your money and buy the 2 or 3 decent songs on iTunes...For there to have been so much amazing orchestral music in the film, the CD soundtrack left out too much and included too many songs not featured in the film."
2,a couple of good sounds but the rest stink,a couple of songs on here are pretty good but the rest of them aren't worth it.
5,"Excellent Value, superb product!","This bug shield is an excellent value, priced well below any products offered by the auto parts stores I visited. It fits perfectly and was simple to install. Everything was just as described and shipping was right on time."
2,Caused wind noise,"This bugflector caused buffeting and wind noise against the top of the windshield of my Silverado. It helped keep bugs off, but I just couldn't stand the noise."
2,Bug Shield quality inferior,"I ordered this LUND bug shield thinking it would be of the same quality as the shield it was replacing (LUND #730438). First thing I noticed was the thickness of this shield was thinner and very flimsy compared to my previous Lund shield. I don't like the way it hugs the front edge of the hood - sticks up too high and looks like it will be flapping in the wind at 70 mph. I have not had the chance to drive the truck on the xway yet but I can tell just by the flimsy nature of the plastic that it will be a problem. It'll probably crack after my first visit thru the car wash. For the cost of this shield, I could have purchased a competetors shield for much less with the same quality had i known LUND had cheapened their product. I would not recommend this bug shield for what it costs."
4,Very good FX information,Barbara has done very well with this book. It is a bit dated but it has the basics and some very good information.
3,Draft Blocker for Bathroom Fan,"I bought this for my bath fan because the other one broke. This item is made from light plastic so I was fairly gentle with it. I had to spelunk into the attic and fend off the giant spiders to install, but it went together fairly easily. Clamp was sold separately. Now the draft from the attic down into the bathroom has been cut off. So far so good."
2,nicely used,"The shoes fit wonderfully and looked great with my dress. However, they looked like someone previously bought them and returned them. There was a scuff on the heel and the soles looked slightly worn. Didn't have time to return them for a new pair before the wedding."
3,Audiophile-Quality Hammered Dulcimer Instrumentals,"This is a great disc for testing the quality of your stereo. There are many interesting and curious sounds to be heard here, however, the featured instrument is the hammered dulcimer, whose sound I might describe as a cross between a harpsichord and a xylophone.Sometimes a bit tedious as primary listening music, but delicious as a sonic backdrop to a delightfully laid-back ""Sunday Morning""."
1,Disappointed,"The book appears to be a compilation of white paper drafts by different people - no clear purposes for solutions, features mis-presented for benefits, no clarity in arguments let alone logic behind, exact paragraphs appearing in several places even before I got to page 80, obvious grammatical errors all over that sometimes I couldn't even begin to guess what the authors were trying to say. This reminds me of one of those C- group papers in university put together in the last minute w/o much efforts or thoughts. Disappointed and suprised the book was written by Cisco people and published by Cisco press."
2,Bland and uninspired,"This album does not seem in any way related to Middle Earth. All of the tracks seem bland and very similar to each other, there is nothing to distinguish one track from another. Having read the books many times, the areas associated with each track are significantly different. I have liked some of Wakeman's other theme albums, particularly Six Wives of Henry VIII, where each track had a distinct character. This album is not up to that standard and the tracks seem to be a mish mash of bland compositions that was thrown together and had titles slapped on them to associate them with LOTR. Given the well developed character of each area in LOTR, I would have expected tracks with distinct character, much as Holst's Planets compositions each have very distinct characters that strongly evoke the character being portrayed. Not so the tracks on this album, they evoked only boredom in this listener."
3,An average text:,"This is not a bad book but not more than an average text. The introduction is grafted on summary of high school algebra that isn't very cohesive or structured.The presentations are rigorous but most modern math books are as well. The presentation is dry. I like math and math texts. Some add humor, some add history, and some add examples of applications to make things more interesting. This book could serve as the basis for a good course if the lecturer was dynamic but as a read it is only average."
2,Very disappointed,"Years ago I used Magie Noire all the time because I loved the way I could smell it for hours after putting it on and almost everytime I wore it people would compliment me on how great I smelled. So when Macys stopped selling it, I was really bummed!Then a few weeks ago my boyfriend discovered it on Amazon and surprised me with a bottle of it. I was so excited when it came in the mail. I immediately opened the box and sprayed some on. At first it seemed to be as I remembered....but then in no time the smell evaporated and I had to reapply. It's as though it has been watered down so much that the fragerance doesn't smell as strong and it only stays with you for a very short time!I was really disappointed and couldn't believe it cost $50 for what seemed to be a very light body mist:(Will not buy again!!!!"
5,Primordial 311,"This was 311's first album, funded and recorded by the band during their years in Omaha, Nebraska, at a time when hair bands were popular. Possessing an innate musicality and original style, Omaha Sessions is raw and revelatory of a band that would go on to be a huge underground and later mainstream success with a host of platinum and gold albums. Songs such as ""Slinky"" and ""Summer of Love"" are favorites even today and are requested by fans at live shows. For Diehard 311 fans it is a must own; others would not find it that appealing."
4,disappointed,it probably works like its supposed to however the pictures didnt fill all the space i guess the reel took up some of the space--i guess i wanted a $10'000 toy for the price i actually paid
4,coming of age around the dinner table...,"Overall, TENDER AT THE BONE is a lovely coming-of-age story with hilarious vignettes that could be woven into a heart-warming comedic drama. All the elements are there, eccentric characters, witty dialogue, over-arching mother-daughter tension and a good meal. The author's childhood is more fascinating, more poignant than her adult transitions, but entire films can be made from many of the short stories.Fantastic characters people this story, including Ruth herself. Her awkwardness and self-esteem issues are painfully obvious, and make her sympathetic and endearing. She smoothly arcs from innocent child to rebel teen to competent woman. Good read!"
3,A Cooking Book,"Tender at the Bone is a story of a womens life revolving around food. Very interesting concept but not delivered so well. I think the story lost a lot when the food was incorporated. This book is sold as ""a true story"" but the main character, Ruth doesn't come off as a real character."
3,"A ""Bad Mom"" book with recipes","While there certainly are some humorous vignettes in these food-centered memoirs,the repeated theme is ""my mom was nuts, treated me badly, and made me unhappy."" Ruth Reichl paints an attractive picture of herself as a plucky little girl, and it would be churlish to be unsympathetic to that girl's plight, but after a while, the adult's version of these past events becomes just too whiney. Most disturbing is Reichl's seeming willingness to absolve her father from any responsiblity for the unhappy episodes she relates. Hey, mom had an excuse ... she's mentally ill! Adored daddy, however, does nothing to protect his daughter from mom's craziness, but emerges if not completely blameless, then certainly a lot more blameless than he should. Left unanswered is the question of whether mom is still alive. If so, how cruel to publish this book now. If not, well some might think that a less public form of catharsis would have been more dignified."
5,One of My Favorites,"If you liked Under the Tuscan Sun, you will probably like Tender at the Bone and its sequel, Comfort Me With Apples. Reading this book is a journey and an adventure, and the reader comes away feeling like they have met a fascinating new friend. If you are interested in travel, food, restaurants, or growing up with a mentally ill parent, you must read these two books!"
3,An 'OK' read,"I enjoyed the book except for the end ... it ends extremely abruptly, like a car that has just run out of gas !!! You are left asking questions about the various people you read about all through the book -are they still alive, divorced,WHAT !!! Maybe she's planning a sequel ..."
3,"Great Gencer, so-so opera","Leyla Gencer never made a bad recording as far as I'm concerned and this is no exception. She is in great form here and as good as always. If you're not familiar with her voice you are missing out on something rare and beautiful. If you don't buy this recording buy something from her, please. However I was only mildly interested in the rest of the recording. The quality of the production isn't too bad, about what you'd expect from a 50's live recording in mono. But I just didn't care for the rest of the opera. It rather bored me and I consider Don Giovanni to be among my favorite 2-3 operas. I own several versions. This one would not hold my attention except for the opportunity to hear Gencer sing Mozart, something a bit different from her normal Bel Canto/Verdi repertoire."
4,It's really a push toy.,"The string is way too short to pull this toy, but my twins both enjoyed pushing it around on the ground (rather like a car or truck), at least until they started walking."
3,Nice but........,somewhat hard to apply with out getting air bubbles. the good thing though is if you can't get rid of air bubbles they are hard to notice when the screen is turned on. Overall I like the protection they give my screen. I detcted no degradation in the sensitivity of the touch screen.I would buy again.
5,Outstanding Product,this product is very effective in healing my wounds. It has no side effects and it speeds the healing process. My friend from Bolivia recommended it. He says the natives use it for everything!
5,Great Tub Toy!,This is a cute quality tub toy. My kids play with it all the time. The sail is a whisle. I like it because it dries quickly between uses and doesn't get slimy or moldy.
3,"So funny, but they won't last all that long","They are really inexpensive but you get what you pay for... They are fun, but will not last long. word"
4,Funny,"I used these as a cast gift for the show the best little whorehouse in Texas. Really appropriate and the cast got a kick out of them. Some of them didn't hold up and the key ring broke off, but I wasn't all that concerned becuz I had extras."
1,Review for International Film Forum VHS tape,"This is one of the worst transfers I have ever watched. It is clearly from a muti-generation copy of the film and the image is blurry and indistinct. Having watched the Ruscico DVD, I was amazed at all of the detail lost in this VHS tape. The movie on the tape is also only 90 minutes long having at least 12 minutes of the Ruscico movie edited out. The sound is full of tape hiss. Avoid this version of the movie."
4,s-titles,"Subtitles are ""glued"" to the screen, there is no possible way to turn them off, this idiocy spoils the greatnes of the visual sequence..."
1,Buyer beware! Choking hazard,"I bought this toy for my friend's 14 month old daughter. While visiting them, my 11 month old son was playing with this toy and when he hit the key on the box, a small piece of the key broke off and the key came off the toy. The piece was small enough to be swallowed."
2,sheddingcomb for shorthaird dogs,almost useless. We have a black lab who sheds constantly. This comb does not remove any loose hair. I do not recommend it .
3,buyer beware,"A good collection, and some first rate movies. So far as I know, however, The Abyss has yet to be remastered in anamorphic format, thus, it's more than likely that the copy of the film in this collection is the same old transfer that was first released nearly a decade ago. On a big, new monitor, it will look pretty poor, and, unless you zoom in, it will be a small little picture in the centre of the screen. Better to wait for the inevitable blu-ray of the film, and the equally inevitable re-mastered DVD release."
1,Have not received,Ordered Hornady Improve Shell Plate and have not received. Said they were in stock when we ordered and then they said they couldn't ship them. Received no explanation.
4,Way better than those stupid candles,"Live in Atlanta. Lots of mosquitoes. This thingy masks the CO2 and stuff that makes them swarm you and leave you looking like a mutant freak if you fall asleep in your hammock. Puts all other cheap repellents to shame. More expensive methods might kill them or work better, but I don't have that kind of money to throw around on parasitic bugs."
4,Effective and cheap!,"Living in CT near the water and a marsh we have a ton of mosquitoes. I bought 4 for the backyard and noticed a big difference last year. While it doesn't get every last mosquito, it is very effective at removing 90%. A bit of a pain having to change batteries every two weeks, but will continue to use them."
2,Wrong recording!,"The idea of an ""operatic"" recording of this work is a bit like that of a ""rock"" version of a Bach cantata: wrong, wrong, wrong. Get the Barbarossa (#01302-2) recording, conducted by Theodorakis, sung by Maria Farandouri and Heiner Vogt, recorded live in Berlin in 1980; THAT'S the way C.G. is supposed to sound: filled with passion and a sense of coming from the hearts of the people."
1,Never received item.,"I never received this, and believe it was shipped to my old address. Nor have I been informed that a refund was issued. Lloyd Hereman"
4,Good volume control,"Decent volume control. Installed relatively quickly. You can go ahead and cut out the back of your remodel or new gang box - this thing is deep. Make sure you screw down the speaker wires as tight as possible - they can slip out when you are cramming everything back in. As noted in other reviews, the faceplate does stand off the wall about 1/16"" - I'm sure this could be fixed but it wasn't a big deal for me. In my installation I mainly use the higher-end of the volume control, but it does the job perfectly and I am pleased."
5,The Spiritual Warriors Promo,Length:: 2:20 MinsA great movie. A movie that is honest to the core. This film has reshaped and healed many people's lives.
4,Saved by Eli & Jo,"Clfford Odets play with a lot of depression and hopeless scenarios. Setting is in 1932 Depression era . No money,no hope & future. Business in the Eli Wallach and Jo Van Fleet family goes under. One Son dying of sleeping sickness. Another Son married to a Tart killed in crime attempt. Bad times get worst day by day finally culminatng in forfeiture of home-sweet-home mortgage and dispossession.One feels Odet's purpose in writing this play was to make his audience reach a level of guild and depression.Undoubtedly a classic work of genius, but if your looking for a cheery or happy moment in this flick, you won't find it here. Not a smile in a carload !"
3,Unrealized potential,"Some unbelieveable bits and some very confusing elements hurt this book. One problem is evident on the first page. The book is set in 1874, and it's the second book in the trilogy. If you choose to read this one, read it last so that the events are in chronological order. 1874 makes Drew (from Once a Mistress) 86 years old. He's still quite healthy and active (Kathryn is still alive too). Drew's brief but important appearance is too short. It seems implausible that he and Kathryn can travel so easily and at such short notice at these advanced ages. Kit is married; it's mentioned at the end of the book, but it happens in book 3 (hmmm).It's fun at times, and Adam is a pretty good hero, but Giana is often unbelieveable. Adam does seem easily deluded. You can read the other two without this one. Or read this one after the other two. But my advice is ""don't buy it."""
3,"Visually pleasing, but...","...lacking something. The pictures are all vivid and colorful but seem to attempt to distract the reader from the lack of substance. Do not get me wrong, Fontana appears to know what he is talking about, but upon skimming the book and then giving it a thorough read-through, I am no closer to interpreting my dreams.I suppose this is because as hard as we may look in the literature to determine what our dreams are attempting to tell us, it's all really way too individual, and no book will be able to completly answer it for us.Regardless, Fontana does give some useful basic summaries of what certain objects, numbers, etc. are SUPPOSED to mean, although I've learned to take his comments in stride. His comments however have somewhat helped me to attempt to shape my own opinion of what my dreams may be saying."
4,"""Drove"" me to my chair to read!!","This author was suggested by the Los Angeles Times. So, I have purchased two of his novels, and enjoy, very much, his unigue story telling style. An entertaining novel to read."
1,"Unreadable, a letdown - Don't waste your time!!","I loved the movie but this book is unreadable. Seriously, I can't understand how someone was able to transform such a garbage (book) into an amazing movie. Even if you liked the movie don't waste your time reading the book, because they are worlds apart, the movie is not like the book. The characters in the book are extremely shallow and don't show any qualities. A totally letdown."
2,EH,"Personally, I do like the penthouse stuff better than the playboy or hustler. However, this is mostly girl/girl. If that's what you like, you'll like this dvd."
5,From walking wounded through functioning again,"From those first horrible days of walking around in a fog, to accepting this trauma and moving on. Dumped is full of great practical advice about what to do and what not to do. It will make you laugh, and it will make you cry, but it will also put some of this madness in perspective and help you to move on."
5,"Enlightening, Really Helps","This is a collection of case histories that are combined to form an enlightening combination. It helps the individual woman in this type of situation to realize what actually happened and that the man involved is crushing, slicing, and dicing her in order to feel better about what he is doing and trot happily off with the new model. The book outlines a realistic plan for recovery from the most devastating blow of a lifetime."
5,Brought me out of a deep funk.,"I first read this book back in 2001 when I was dumped after a seven year relationship. This book, together with my faith in God and lots of prayer of course, brought me out of a deep pit of despair. It may not lighten the load for everyone, but it did for me. It's worth a try."
4,It's cool,I bought this toy at toys'r'us and my son really likes it. he especially loves the door bell. the only thing is that it is hard to put together and take apart. other than that it is a really great play center.
5,"Great workout, very rewarding!","It has been now some years since I started training myself with Billy Blanks's DVDs. I appreciate these trainings of Boot Camp Elite because these are trainings which works all the body, ultra-effective and dynamic. With the elastic bands, we can cut a little more at the level of shoulders and arms. For those who want to push a little farther, I recommend you strongly the Ultimate Boot Camp, which pushes farther the limits of the mental and physical endurance and resistance, I did not find more extreme and effective, on today...Good training to all...God bless you"
4,Works...but maybe not as easy to install,"Within minutes we could detect a rise in laundry room temperature (it is February) after I installed a vent closure for both the dryer AND for a shower vent from the same room. That more than offsets any of the complications with the installation, to me. The end of the hard or flex vent pipes exiting the house do not ""neatly"" fit with the female receiving end (against the house) of these closure units, at least neither of mine did. A descriptive of possible options - Plan B, Plan C, etc. - would have been helpful upfront. It took a while to adapt then secure the unit to the pipes then to the house. In other words, this may not be a 10 minute installation effort. Be prepared to shim the siding a bit and to have to ""customize"" the feeding vent pipe into the closure unit.But winters will be warmer and summers will be cooler in that room...amen."
2,Dryer Vent,This is the best dryer vent I have ever owned would reccomend this to anyone. Stops all back draft from outside.
3,super easy,"It was everything expected: easy to install and fit perfectly. It was inexpensive and it shows. The blind closes easily by itself or if the wand hits it, or too much movement with the door. For me it's ok. The house is a rental,but I enjoy the light from the door window and yet privacy at night. I'm happy."
2,3D?,"Not much of this movie is converted to 3D. It seems only when the Count is in the scene or at his castle is it in 3D. When it is , it is good. I like the idea of converting the old movies like this one to 3D, but convert the entire movie."
5,just what I was looking for,I have severe chronic back pain and nerve pain down my rt let. I have suffered for a long time. I am now in a functional rehab program and they suggested this product for the support it provides and the way it collapses to a small size for travel. My husband & I are planning to take a train ride for our 25th anniversary and I was concerned whether I could do it or not. I love the versatility of the pressure and how easy it is to inflate or collapse. I am glad the therapists let me try theirs.
4,Another challenging story by Lois Lowry,"The author is known for her sudden and unconventional endings. The best of these being The Giver. The Silent Boy is the author's most recent work. It too provides a conclusion that defies the usual ""feel good"" story endings of most children and adult novels. To some this may be disconcerting, but I commend the writer for respecting her audience enough to challenge their imagination and intellect. That said, I found this story to be less engaging than some of her other works. I would have preferred the story to say more about the boy of the book's title. Overall, I believe that this book is very appropriate for youths fourth grade and older."
3,This book was pretty good,"I think that The Silent boy was alright. I liked the story and all of the charcters. I didn't like how it was a slow build up though. I think the beginning was kind of boring and could have been better, the ending was good though. I think this book would be good for older teens maybe around 15 or 16. Overall it was a well written book.-East Detroit student-"
1,Is this a joke?,"I can't believe this book is suppossed to be taken seriously. This has nothing to do with the ""art of photographing women."" This is about taking a snapshot picture and then transforming her through photoshop into a barbie doll.Most of the examples show how to trim the edges of a woman's body off to make her look thinner. I feel bad for the women who's pictures are in the book cause by the end of the photoshopping they look like dolls. I returned this book ASAP!!"
3,a little disapointed..,"We got this set for our 1 yr old, hoping to encourage her to have more fun in the bath. She liked it pretty well at first, liked picking up the ducks, but she couldn't (and still can't) open the momma duck by herself. She's 17 months old now, and she never plays with it anymore at all. Also, the ducks really want to stay upside down in the water. I really wouldn't recommend this duck set, even though it's cute."
4,Good for the price,"This is a fun, although dated, workout video. I love the outfits and big hair! It still serves the same purpose as if it was created in 2012. High-energy for sure. Denise Austin fans will enjoy this!"
4,The greatest heavy music from Brazil,"If you count Sepultura as a world band who sings in english, than Ratos de Poro is the greatest heavy band from Brazil. This band in concert is really, really heavy. I see than in stage 3 times, and always was a wonderful esperience. The sound of Ratos is a mix of Slayer, Grind core and punk attitude with lyrics that talk about the underground in Brazil, religion and chaos around the world. Even if you don't understand portuguese, you can shake your head with these heavy sound."
3,Denali 300-Piece Drill Accessory Set with 3 Drawer Chest,I received this set and had some bits out of place in the box but it wasn't a big deal. It has what I need for home use. I used one of the long shank wood bits and noticed the tip was bent after making one hole. I bent it back but it finally broke. Tells me the quality is lacking but for the price and convenience it will do.
2,Yin Yang NOT Glued on Well,"Although these are beautiful and just what I was looking for, the decorative Yin/Yang ""button"" came off of 3 out of 4 I installed. I had to glue them back together and had difficulty getting them centered correctly (no guiding edge)"
4,wonderful tool for finding women in history,This book is a wonderful introduction to the role of women throughout European history. Women have often been written out of history. This book allows readers to see the important positions and influence that women have held through some of the major time periods and events in history.
4,I love reel deal games,I love all the reel deal slot titles. We own most of them now and all are great.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I bought this book a while back, but kept putting it off. I thought it would be another run of the mill romance, but I was pleasantly surprised. The heroine, while prone to a little too much demuring, was actually more likeable in my eyes than the average heroine. The plot was interesting and kept me involved, and I was actually surprised by the ending, a rarety. Justin is a likeable hero, a change from the usual run of the mill stoic silent alpha male. The locale is also presented in a likeable way. Even with the colloqialisms in the dialogue, none of the bayou people sounded stupid or illiterate, merely the simply, humble people they are. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something a little more than the average romance."
4,page-turning until the end!,"Based on the back cover, Laurel has the gift of ""sight"" (premonitions), passed down from generations on her mother's side of the story. If you have an open mind for believing in what could happen, you will enjoy this book. I was engrossed until the very end.One of my favorite traits of Dinah McCall's writing is that there's more to the plot than ""boy gets girl."" Her books aren't the same old question of whether the main male character will get together with the main female character - they have more substance than that. The subplot regarding the history surrounding Mimosa Grove (the name of the estate her grandmother passed down to Laurel) was magical, sad, and comforting (that everything is connected) all rolled into one. The primary plot was mystical, suspenseful and beautiful.The book was so well-written that it left me wanting to believe that this could happen in real life. If you're looking for a little magic and romance, you will definitely enjoy this book!"
4,Romance from the paranormal,"I liked this book even with the lack of high octane suspense. The romance was definitely different as the two main characters dream about one another without ever meeting for months. As far fetched as it seems. The story and the characters really stayed with me. I just finished reading Lisa Jackson's The Morning After where women are being buried alive in open graves and thought how nice it would have been to have a person that had the gift of sight like the heroine in Mimosa Grove to help catch a serial killer. Throughout that book, I couldn't get my mind off of Mimosa Grove. If the thought of psychic abilities intrigues you in the slightest, you will love this book. Just know that it truly is a romance novel with a paranormal theme."
1,Save your money!!!!,This album ISN'T any lost psychedelic holy grail. Anybody could record this turkey in their basement with a bunch of friends screaming into a mic and pounding on garbage cans. GARBAGE!
4,Interesting Book,I enjoyed the third installment in this series. It gave me some good historical and Biblical background on our understanding of Hell. It was also a good story woven into the material.
1,N.T. Wright REGURGITATED,"NT thinks the one who can destroy body and soul in hell"" is SATAN...hehehe."
5,Best one yet in the trilogy,"I found this to be the best book in the new Kind of Christian Trilogy (It also should be noted that I very much liked the other two). If you have questions/doubts about hell especially in regards to an all loving & graceful God then I cannot recommend this book enough.He manages to point out that the traditional approaches are flawed not just because of their approach to scripture but rather because they are asking the wrong questions in the first place.While this book is sure to be frustrating to someone who thinks they have it all figured out & anyone who disagrees with them is in danger of being a heretic, it will most likely be encouraging to anyone who strives for their allegiance to be to Christ rather than a specific doctrinal stance. It will also be an encouragement to anyone who is simply curious about Christianity.McLaren is one of the best thinkers in the evangelical community that I have come across & this is one of his best works."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"If I could I'd give this 10 stars! I'm practically in highschool, and this is still my favorite band! I don't see how anyone can't like this! The world would truely be a better place with more hamster bands."
2,The Allume Spring Cleaning for Mac OSX,After I bought this product I had a question for the seller. I was told that the product really was an old cleaning product for Macintosh. However the seller readily agreed to take it back and return my money if i wasn't satisfied.
4,New (Eastern) Europe,"A fresh perspective on Eastern Europe. Michael explains the evolution and results of the release from behind the Iron Curtain. Very worth while - music, food, trains, people, agriculture and history. The overbuilt government building in Romania shows the cost and kinds of problems people and countries face. This is Palin well done."
1,Sucks beyond measure...,Got this for a Christmas present...awful awful awful...did I say AWFUL??? Everything that you read about this camera is true....Poor indoor pictures...Eats batteries left and right...even when it is off...Cheaply made product all together....You have been warned....
3,decent for the money,"i bought this camera at walmart for $60 roughly 9 months ago.it was a step up from my last camera because it had a lcd, flash, and higher res. on the downside it doesn't have a microphone. it does not take very good photos in low lighting conditions and the flash is too powerful for most instancesi'd include a picture but they are all on my other computeri wouldn't recommend this camera for anything indoors or anything short of broad daylight. also the flash uses up most of the batteries and the 3 AAAs don't last very long (get rechargeables) the only use i can see for this camera is pictures on bicycle rides or walks during the day otherwise it is quite useless. the main thing that really turned me away was that it (or at least mine) had little gray stripes accross the image and a lack of saturation of color. i sent it back to get the screen fixed (at least the tech support is decent) and i am thinking of getting a kodak c330 and selling it here."
2,Here is some help for you people that need it,I have noticed and talked to several people with the same problem I found the manufacters website for a friend with the drivers here is the link http://www2.sakar.com/modules.php?name=Downloads&d_op=viewdownload&cid=5 it is the third one down.
5,Product was in excellent condition and quality,"This album is enjoyable to any who loved the ""best"" of the 50's-60's poetry. It makes you think not get freaky."
3,"retractable convenience, sound quality poor","I have bought alot of earbud headphones in the $5-$20 range, These headphones are worth the money if you want the convenience of not having a tangle of cables. By necessity, the retractability of the cable requires the cable is rather short, as are the cables of all retractable headphones (about 3'instead of the normal 5'). Also, the manufacturer (as most manufacturers of retractable headphones) in addition to saving money by having a 3' cable, saves money by selling headphones whose audio quality is poor. For less than $20 you can get a pair of Sony earbud headphones with a 5' cable and good sound quality. Unless you must have retractable headphones or you need these headphones for very limited usage (ie as a back-up), I would not recomend this product."
1,Awful,"I've gone through two retractable headphones and they are cheap so I expect low quality audio and simple design. However, these are the worst. Audio quality is terrible. The design is the real problem, though. The retraction mechanism is too big and too heavy. The earbuds do not fit tightly in the ear so the mechanism pulls them out of the ears unless you shove them in so deep it touches your eardrums. It's also too long for my uses, but I agree that's just a preference."
2,"Technically, it is a workbook.","I will agree with one of the other reviews in stating this is more of a workbook than textbook.I was looking for a book that would have a listing of numerous adjectives all conjugated much like the ""The Complete Japanese Verb Guide."" Instead I got a lot of blank pages where I had to figure out how to conjugate myself.The work mostly consists of translating into Japanese with adjectives thrown in for you to work on. Even though there is a list of answers in the back, it would have been nice to just have a list of conjugated adjectives.If you are willing to teach yourself how to conjugate adjectives and are already assisting classes, this book will help you to better understand, but it will require you to work for the answers.Overall, it's a workbook."
1,Yellow Ink cartridge,I ordered 3 cartridges 1 cyan 1 magenta 1 yellow. The cyan and magentacartridges were full the yellow only had about a quarter cartridge of ink in it. Is there any thing you can do about this?Please answer.Thank youEva Mabry
3,ok for the price.,I am a cowboy fan and wanted a replica to play around with...This is not really a play around type replica. Feels like it will break if played with too much.I dont like the fact that it has casting marks... not smooth like a real one...Wooden handle is nice touch... and it feels pretty decent when holding...Overall ok... but not Great.
3,"Realy nice look and feal, but...","My brother and I bought this replica hoping to get better at spinning and other tricks with a single action revolver(not wanting to risk dropping the real ones). These have a very similar feel and weight and they do look alright from not to far away.I rated this a 3 because after 10 days the hammer broke, and after about a month the whole thing was pretty much in pieces. Please keep in mind, we were not throwing the gun around, but we were treating it alot harder than it was probably meant for.Bottom line, if you want to get it for replica purposes and put it on the wall or something, go for it. But, if you want to pretend your a gunslinger, then get(or use) the real thing(unloaded, over carpet)."
2,My Wife's Thoughts,"I purchased the Balance Ball Media Set for my wife. She has been practicing Bikram Yoga for several years. She only likes 1 out of the 3 DVD's in the set ... the abs DVD. She finds the other 2 DVD's to be too slow, boring and not much of a workout."
4,I really liked it...,"It's understandable, yet when my group of yogis did these routines (all of them) we were pleasantly sore the next day. I liked it so much I loaned it to someone, didn't get it back, and now will go look for it and buy it again."
4,pretty darn sweet,"As a costumer, this is an essential library piece. Not only does it have pictures of some lovely details, the explanations also have some good tips on how some of these decorations were accomplished. I would have liked to have seen a picture of the entire garment the detail came from, and sometimes the blurb wasn't very specific. All in all, a good book to own!"
5,"A ""must have"" for lovers of the 18th century","Anyone with a love of the 18th century will drool over the many detailed photos and illustrations in this book.Those who Rendezvous often painstakingly work to recreate the fashion of the period. Though these fashions are more fitting for the drawing room, the lines and details can be translated into dressing for the common man as the lines of each of the garments are included for reference.Fans of embroidery will enjoy this book as well because of the close up photographs of actual 18th century clothing and embroidery techniques. It's eye candy for lovers of history and good design alike!"
4,Winning Wager,"Forced to marry the unwanted ward of a nasty gamester to avoid bankruptcy, Trevor stiffens his upper lip and honors his debt. It apparently doesn't occur to him that Caitlin is somewhat less than overjoyed at the prospect of marriage to him until after the ceremony. This is almost a Regency coming-of-age story. Evidently Trevor was a bit slow to mature--7 years seems a bit excessive. The true pivotal characters are Caitlin and Aunt Gertrude. Caitin's warmth, common sense, and patience in the face of adversity (especially husband related) give the book depth and interest. I frequently found myself wanting to give Trevor a swift kick, but he finally realized that he was a man and could afford to tell his parents ""no."" The manner in which his sister Melanie resolves the question of the child's paternity is delightfully humorous and devious. Well worth reading--more than once."
5,One of a Kind,"Truly one of the saddest movies I've ever seen. It's title hints at the subject, but it's much deeper. Complex in its simplicity. No ""special effects"" here. Just raw humanity or lack there of. A must see when you have the time."
1,Don't waste your time.,I've got a Chesapeake Bay Retriever who is on 50mg of allergy medicine 4 times a day. I was looking into this as an alternate to the benadryl. It didn't work at all; I wouldn't waste my time with this.
4,A Sincere Look Into The Demons We All Battle,"This book shows that although wrestlers get hit in the head with chairs, thrown through tables, and have countless injuries, they are human. The book is a sincere and passionate look into sports entertainment and the demons that Shawn Michaels has had to defeat to get to the level he is on now. It is definately a must read for any wrestling fan and will clear up any misgivings that anyone has about Michaels and proves that he is by far the best there ever is and will be in sports entertainment."
3,Not complete,"This is a good book, but there are some things left out. For instance, he says that he was attacked in a bar, but he never tells you that it was the marines who beat him up. Also left out is the match where they accidentally broke that guys neck and Marty Jannetty got fired. I just wish these things had been addressed."
2,HBK Goody Two Shoes,"I have always enjoyed watching HBK in the ring. I have been on a kick of reading wrestler autobiographies of late, so reading this one was a must on my list.While it is not a bad read, HBK (and/or his ghostwriter)sugarcoats himself to the point the reader may be tempted to roll his or her eyes. Although he swears he never tried to hold anyone back, he then talks about being in a meeting with the Kliq and Vince and giving his opinion on who is ""deadweight"". There are many more contradictions of this nature throughout the book. By the end of the book you have the feeling that Shawn has just been trying to charm you over to his side and has no faults.Much better reads on this subject matter includeHitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestlingor either of Chris Jericho's books."
2,Shawn do you actually think youre on the way to heaven?Think again!,Shawn Michaels is nothing more than an hypocrite and a liar.Of course everyone has made mistakes in the past including Michaels but by owning up to them doesnt mean you're an changed person and an christian either.Ex say if I admit that I stole something and Im really sorry.Yes I owned up to it but that doesnt neccesarily mean Im an changed person.I just owned up to the mistake that I made.Shawn acts the same way.Shawn says he was sorry for an lot of things he's done but he hasnt changed an bit.He's the still the same ol HBK.EX;The God angle leading up to Backlash.Shawn do youre actually think youre going to heaven with that kind of behavior.Well you're dead wrong.
3,A changed man with changed stories,"A few years ago, I saw the RF Video shoot interview with Michaels. Wow, has his attitude changed. He appears humble with a few of is HBK tendencies appearing here and there. If you are interested in finding out the truth about Montreal, Shawn has a version that will blow your mind. Also, watch the Bret Hart DVD and compare the two and you will realize that we will never know what happened.I was a little disappointed to not get more stories about his recent big matches, but I understand that he only had so many pages he could fill. If you are a wrestling fan, you will probably like this book. Non-wrestling fans will find his climb out of darkness compelling."
5,HBK is truly an icon,"I grew up watching Shawn Michaels, he is my all time favorite professional wrestler so as soon as I seen he had a book out, I went and got it. I already new alot about HBK, but this book taught me more about him than Iam sure most people new.From seeing and hearing HBK on Tv you think oh wow look at him he's just so perfect and a phenominal athlete but reading the book you learn differently. The book taught me that he is a regular person too, with everyday problems and struggles. His strive and devotion to find Gof was truly inspirational/impressing. Great book Shawn, pat yourself on the back."
1,Horrible book full of ignorance,This book gets horrible marks simply for the idiotic and ignorant statement regarding Bret Hart. Hart is arguably the greatest in-ring technician of all time and the statements Shawn makes regarding Bret are completely laughable. Michaels truly is a piece of work.
1,Wrong camera,"The camera I received was not the camera that was advertised, and as of this date I still haven't resolved the matter with the seller."
1,Cheaply made,"I purchased one of these at a brick and mortar store because I'd left my good one at home. I should have saved my money. My camera uses Compact Flash memory cards which are ""keyed"" to prevent inserting the wrong way. The case of this Targus card reader is so flimsy, it is possible to insert the card the wrong way without forcing it. Doing so, bent two of the pins over and, when I tried to copy the photos to my iPad, all of the photos on the card were corrupted and became un-readable. There are lots of good card readers on the market. This is not one of them."
3,Good,"This is a good album for Ziggy's first solo project, but it is inconsistant. I bet if you asked Ziggy about this album he would say that its ""experimental."" The experiment is about half successful and half unsuccessful. Half of the songs have nice grooves, great lyrics, and a fun style. The other half of the songs are too rock/pop influenced for my taste. The best songs are Dragonfly, True To Myself, Shalom Salaam, and Rainbow In The Sky. The worst songs are the last three on the cd. If you don't already own Love Is My Religion by Ziggy, get that first because it is his best album. This is good, but not as essential as Love Is My Religion."
3,Dragonfly,"I know Ziggy and I keep listening to all his production, but this music is a little too commercial.When he was performing with the Melody Makers (and his brother Stephen) his music was more mature..."
2,an uninspired piece of hackwork,"you get the feeling that bill harry wrote this off the top of his head,there are a number of factual errors, (Jim croce's biggest hit is listed as ""you don't mess around with the operator"")and unless you live on mars Barbara Streisand,the Rolling Stones and Rod stewart don't belong in a ""whatever happened to?"" book. there are a number of good moments and mr Harry seems to know what he's talking about when it comes to english performers but there were too many stones left unturned for this rock fan."
5,Very Neat Addition To The Thomas Line,"I bought Stepney and the Museum Cars for my son at Christmas. He saw them in a Thomas the Tank Engine ""wish book"", and had been asking for them.The pictures in those brochures really don't do these cars justice! The jewel car is made of clear, sturdy plastic and is framed with a matte gold color. The train itself is royal blue. The neat thing, though, is that a treasure chest is nestled inside...and 7 plastic ""jewels"" that move around when you shake the car. The jewels are different colors, including clear, aquamarine, orange, purple, magenta, orange, and more--and are faceted in different shapes.The fossil car features a small skeleton of a T-Rex that's ""imbedded"" in dirt. The side of the car says ""Sodor Museum T-Rex Exhibit"".Stepney is sturdy, as well, and pulls the museum cars to their destination.Your child will love this set if they're into the Thomas line, especially if they're into dinosaurs, fossils, treasures, jewels/stones, etc."
5,If you like the Belgariad this book is perfect,"Well after such a marvelous series such as the Belgariad, Eddings had to write a seqeuel. And there it is- in all it's splendor. This book is the first of this series- and it is one heck of a book. In the best of the Eddings tradition, this book is both exhilirating and amusing. Eddings has the talent of making the charcters full, the plot intricate and comprhensive, and the layout realistic as possible. You would think that he himself is a master strategist and comedian. This book is a MUST!!!"
3,A pleasant return to well-known lands and characters,"This certainly isn't the best work of Eddings. The plot is basically the same as his previous novels, but the sense of wonder that was so present in the Belgariad is largely missing. The writing is workman-like as the book wanders from scene to scene revisiting old characters, never quite going anywhere. Still, I greatly enjoyed it. It was quite pleasant to read about characters many of us had grown to love and were sorry to leave at the end of the Belgariad. Anyone who read and loved the wonderful character interaction of the earlier novels will surely look fondly on this novel, but its obvious flaws would make it difficult for non-fans to enjoy."
4,Belgariad a hard act to follow.,"This is a great book. The problem is that it's a sequel to the Belgariad, so it pales in comparison. Belgariad fans will love this, but if you haven't read the Belgariad first, don't try this one yet."
4,Good stuff!,"Eddings in the Malloreon shows again that he is one of fantasies greats!. The story is a ton of fun and I honestly cant think of anything wrong...well, I could have handled a tad more magic, but that's all.The Malloreon isnt as good as the Belgareon, but it sure is worth it!The Malloreon rates in my top 10 all time reads/series with the likes of Martin, Erikson and Tolkien.. Of course Eddings is much more fantasy ""lite"" than those guys, but he is a extremely fun author."
2,Garblings of the Worst,"Disappointing and very lightweight. I didn't read the Belgariad but I don't think that mattered at all. I think Eddings deliberately stretched this out for the MONEY!! Most of the book deals with a series of crises for Garion and his queen, Ce'Nedra. They aren't having sex...Wah!! They don't have any kids...Wah! Those guys are fighting, make them stop...Wah!! The old king died, what do we do...Wah! Those people don't want to listen to me and are leaving the kingdom. Whine, whine, whine. My advice would be to start with the last 100 pages where events are set up for the next novel or just skip to the summary of the next novel, as one other reviewer suggested."
5,easy and fun,"My son first found one of these on the playground and for a kuzoo type toy, it is awesome because it really works. It is an annoying kuzoo sound, but very easy to make and manipulate sound with. We bought one the next day."
2,Trying to fing a song!,"Hi, I've been trying to find this song from the 80's that I think is called ""Spring Love"". I really don't know who signs it but I want to have it because it's a nice memory. The rythm is like a hip hop semi rap song but you can dance with it, a little classical melody too, 2 woman sings and the lirics say something about: I remember when we first started..., ... Spring Love, come back to me... . If you can help me I apreciate (morphosis25@yahoo.com). P.S.: is from 1987-1990."
2,"""AVR: An Introductory Course""- like, for programmers?","Unfortunately, found this book to be primarily a programming book, and minimally useful from a semi-newbie hardware perspective.Far better, and more in depth hardware and programming information is available for FREE at www.avrfreaks.comWish I'd known that before..."
4,A book about everything,"Author quickly explains short board fundamentals - water start (in detail), clew water start, etc.Then he shows common freestyle tricks - helicopter, sail 360 and others with lots of photos but little text (5-7 pictures for a move with short titles). These explanations are like that can be easily found in the Internet.Other subjects - jumps, loops, wave riding described in the same manner. This book is pretty out of date now, so modern tricks are not explained (spock, volcano ...).It is of course not a beginner book but probably it can be useful for more advanced sailors.My opinion that it is better to buy 2-3 windsurfing videos than this book."
2,Less than quality liners,"I just purchased these baskets for our changing table and was very disappointed when I got home and opened the box. The actual basket was fine (although not the proper color for my personal nursery) but the liners just seemed cheap. i placed them in the basket, attempted to tie one of the bows and the string ripped into 2 pieces. Then they didn't fit very well into the basket and appeared to be stretching the seams to the point where they might rip open. I will be returning these and looking elsewhere for my baskets!"
5,Pentax 62212 small and good,"Bought these for my wife to carry on vacation out west. They work well, are light weight and easy to set up for your eyes if they are different."
4,"Very likable protagonist, breezy in style.","McCown sets out to make his protagonist, Nolan Vann, very likable, and he succeeds. He sets out to capture the positive aura of a small town where everyone knows everyone, and he succeeds there also, without whitewashing some unsavory aspects of small town life. The book is quite readable, but a little too slick. The final scene is particularly well written. For those readers who liked this book, but wish it weren't so slick, I recommend Shameless by Lisa Reardon."
2,Lid is Hard to Screw on and Off,The lids on these sprouter jars don't turn easily. I had to apply olive oil to the threads to get mine to loosen up. I tried four of these sprouter jars at Good Earth Natural Foods and all were very difficult to screw on and off.The price also needs to come down a bit to attract more customers.Amazon price $23.00 with shippingGood Earth $7.01 with tax
2,compatible laptop battery,"10.80V (Compatible with 11.10V),4000mAh,Li-ion,Hi-quality Replacement Laptop Battery for TOSHIBA Satellite 5000, TOSHIBA Satellite A100, 5005, 5100, 5105 Series, Compatible Part Numbers: B499, PA3123U-1BRS, PA3178, PA3178U, PA3178U-1BAS, PA3178U-1BRS, P...The service from the vendor was great. The battery fit and I charged it fully. When fully charged the battery only gives me ONE hour of service. I expected more, maybe next time I'll go with the real item instead of one that is ""compatible""."
5,Winans Phase 2 Taking it to the Next Level,"This album was truly beautiful. I loved everyone song on this album from start to finish. The songs on this album had deep,powerful and encouraging messages. Winans Phase 2 are defintely taking it to the next level."
5,A generation of blessings,"I first heard some songs in the album at a party and wondered who were this blessed people. I would say and always say the Winans definitely know how to bring up their kids. If they could keep on having generations and they are still as God fearing as the Ever, u guys are blessed and keep up the good work. I may not know the family personaly, but it has been a blessing to know u guys. Keep up the good work. God bless"
2,Waste of Time,Henry Fonda is one of Hollywood's icons and one of my favorite actors. Mr. Fonda has such a prolific film career that one can easily put together a sizable box set e.g. John Wayne's.The films selected in this collection makes no sense and didn't do Mr. Fonda justice. Very few people will be interested in ordering it. 2 stars for the collection.
3,"I hate it, but...","I hate this nasty little device, but my husband and children are delighted with it. My husband thinks it's a great gag and fancies himself a great joker like someone named, Jack Vail, who apparently has his own YouTube channel devoted entirely to bathroom humor.My husband walked around holding his stomach squeezing it all day at a family get together until his sister thought her cooking had made him really sick."
3,Board book is too small,"Truthfully, I didn't check to see the size when I ordered this. I just wanted a bunch of the ""Sheep"" books for my boys and ordered the styles that were available for the B3G1F promotion--two were paperback, and two were board books. As board books go, this is among the smallest I've seen. It's 5"" square. For this illustrator in particular, the size doesn't do it justice. I will have difficulty enjoying this with my 3 boys when I read to them (and when the eldest reads to his brothers). They won't be able to see the pictures very well. Had they been at least the size of the Boynton books, or the size of the paperbacks, the pictures would have been easier to share.As to the book content, I was already familiar with the subject and would give this 5 stars for that. Hope none of the shoppers mind my lukewarm review. I wish I had known the great illustrations were packed in so tightly so that I could have held out for the paperback."
5,Very good and reliable card,"I use this card with the Netgear MR814 802.11b Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router and they work together flawlessly.I've had my network up since November every single day without spending more than 2 hours to set it all up. The signal strength I get is really good even with two floors between the router and the wireless card.For those of you interested this card works great with Linux as well. I use kernel 2.4.24 and I never have a problem, while I had some issues with versions up to 2.4.20.It works equally well with XP and 2K as well."
5,A perfectly fine wireless networking card,I purchased a couple of MA311s and MA401 and a MR814 access point. Installation was very simple. It installs like most other PCI cards but the instructions say to install the drivers and configuration utility first. I installed the MA311s in a Windows Me machine and a Windows 98SE box and both went in without a hitch. The antenna is removeable which facilitates installation and onced installed is easily oriented to maximize signal reception. Signal strength is very good. The router is on the third floor and one computer is on the first. Signal strength is well above 70% and Link strength is >80%.The configuration software is easy to use and setup. Offers basic functions that support WEP and MAC address filtering of the router.Overall a solid wireless networking card and with the current rebate offered by Netgear a fair deal.
3,"Lousy Software & Support, Great Hardware","Software & support 1 star, card 5 stars. I have two of these, and they work quite well with M$ generic drivers for Windows 2000 & XP, and Linux Orinoco drivers.Netgear's own software is lousy on Windows- aside from the installer corrupting my registry once and putting a bunch of icons on my desktop, it doesn't add anything beyond Microsoft's. Their drivers don't even exist for Linux, but since they use a generic chipset, most distributions can support it. Their telephone support doesn't exist, and it is nearly impossible to find any helpful information on the MA311 on their website.Those negatives aside, the card works quite well, which is the most important issue for me. If you're technically competent and don't need any handholding, this isn't a bad card."
5,This is what hardcore should always strive to be,"I'm a huge fan of Poison the Well and like some other hardcore bands like Botch...but for the most part I think there is a plethora of crap in the genre (see bands like Terror and Every Time I Die).What puts bands like PTW and Remembering Never into a completely different league? First, these guys are unbelievable musicians. Since this review is for Remembering never:This band features some incredible composition, bad ass lead work, interesting rhtyms, and passionate/powerful vocals.And this band is talking about things they feel passionately about. It isn't like most of the other bands in hardcore that are ultra self-interested with lyrics like ""She makes me angry blah blah blah.""So if you have half a brain, you'll understand why this album is above and beyond most of the other bands in the genre. They use hardcore as a tool and style for communication...but essentially these guys are musicians."
4,Great...........................,"I went to school with Brian and I find this a gripping disclosure of his life. Like Brian, I am a Thalidomide and find his potral of life as very true. Great book by good friend of mine!!"
4,An interesting studio experience...,"Israel and New Breed teamed up with multi-talented musician/singer/writer/producer Tommy Sims to put together Real, the follow-up to their successful live debut, New Season. This time, instead of a live recording, they put Real together as a studio recording, and the result is mostly successful.My personal favorites of the album are ""Better"" and ""Magnificent and Holy,"" although the majority of the album works very well. There are a couple of songs that wouldn't necessarily be missed if they'd been left off the album (""'Bout It 'Bout It"" and ""Real"" come to mind), but they don't detract from the overall quality of the album.After this album, Israel went back to releasing live recordings, which seem to translate the energy of the group a little better than this album. However, Real is still miles ahead of the majority of gospel/praise and worship music that's being released today, and I highly recommend it..."
4,The essential Bisson!,"Terry Bisson became one of my favorite fantasy authors from the first time I read ""Bears Discover Fire"" in Asimov's -- before it won the Hugo and Nebula. Many of the other stories in this collection I consider to be classics ... though others I never want to read again! The themes Bisson explores in these short stories are the same ones that emerge in greater detail in his novels, so this is an ideal primer to his work."
4,Just a Touch of Wierdness,"Bisson's imagination is truly on a slant with the real world, but he's even on a slant with the world of sci fi and fantasy. Not really sci fi, not really fantasy, not really mainstream. What kind of writer is this guy? Really, really good. That's what kind."
1,dumbing down down down,This is the literary equivalent of fast food.Like Saliere the author has the ability totransform profound themes into mediocrity.
5,sweet milk,Koda Kumi is one of Japans most famous and best singers at the moment. She combines great looks and even greater singing into one pop diva!She oftens sings Japanese which might be a turn off to some but the beat and her deep voice catch you anyway. She can be the girl next door just as well as the vamp that makes you begg for more and this she expresses in her music.
3,"Holds many, but small holes!","Although this holder can accommodate up to 10 scarves, the holes are pretty small. It couldn't fit in some of my warm scarves, but it could fit the thinner, cotton ones. Also, sometimes I find it difficult to take off and return the scarves from and into the holes."
3,Holes are too small to fit scarves,"You can only fit the thinnest of knit scarves on this thing. Some fit, but would be damaged being slid in and out of it. None of my wool scarves fit through the holes."
5,Great for organizing,We have a very small closet so anything that helps maximize space is a plus. This hanger provided a way for me to hang my scarves up (as opposed to sitting in baskets on a shelf) and made it easier to see what I have.
3,Smaller than expected.,This hanger was much smaller than I expected - the holes in the hanger hold thinner summer scarves ok but anything wool is pretty tight in there. The holes are not smooth and have a few rough areas inside so be careful when putting prettier more delicate fabrics in them. Another review suggested sanding the holes and I may when I have some time!
3,the hanger is very bulky,"the hanger is for scarves, which are feather light. So why is this hanger so damn bulky? You's think it was for hanging heavy chains and not scarves. Make a slimmer version of this, one that I can actually travel with and put in my suitcase."
5,All around GREAT holder,It took me a moment to figure out the BEST way to string my scarfs through. Most of mine are thicker. Best way for any scarf is to grab a the very corner and pull through. Surprised at how organzied this really made my scarfs and how nicely they lay in the closet now. LOVE this hanger and recommend to anyone with scarfs.
1,Where's the beef?,"I am not against 'alternative' speculation.Terry Witt has written (Null Physics) a tome that proposes (can't say different as quantum theory is fog with numbers) a visually manageable way to view current observations in physics from quantum to relativity all in one formulation. Not it isn't 'One Theory for Dummies'. It is a deep deep and praiseworthy mathematical embodiment of real phenomena. Could be wrong. But that's OK. Maybe, if somehow missing a cog on a gear, it will evoke the better formulation in someone else's head. The point is that Terry's work is hugely evolved and argued stepwise through all facets of real world physics.This book, on the other hand, is like a bar room rant from somebody who better not have his keys to the car. All disconnected this's and that's. See? Huh? You see? See it? Do you? THEY don't want you to know this because THEY suck your brains or something. ???A good book to stop the patio table from rocking."
3,"There is no such thing as ""Zero Point Energy""","There is no such thing as ""Zero Point Energy,"" nor is there ""free"" or ""unlimited"" energy.The claims made by this book are ridiculous.Perpetual energy, free energy, perpetual motion, etc., are all SCIENCE FICTION ideas which propose that energy is unlimited.Any physicist will say that energy is the ability to perform work AGAINST OR ALONG A FORCE.There are four forces: gravity, electro-magnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear.Basically, the concept of ""Zero Point Energy"" or ""free energy"" would contradict all of them.There is a ""theoretical"" term called ""vacuum"" energy, which is the supposed ""energy"" of free space, but this isn't Zero, it's just a VERY LOW ENERGY STATE. It isn't free or renewable."
1,Filthy and gross,"It's obvious they are sending out the same dirty, broken and used product they've sent to 2 other people. I ordered this for a Christmas exchange, luckily we opened it before or I would have been mortified. The product has yellowed, is filthy and still has food and grime on it! Do not order this product as it looks like you could end up with the one I'm about to send back!"
4,Works well,California law prohibits the use of windshield mounts and I did not want to permanently stick a pad on the dashboard to use the standard suction mount. So I purchased this friction mount. It is also very convenient to move from car to car.It doesn't slip even during moderately spirited driving. It will fall off only under extreme hard acceleration or turns.I only wish that Garmin would include this free of charge with the navigation unit since they know windshield mounts are illegal in California. Chopping off one star for this.
4,adequate to do its job,"The mount's friction pads are adequate for most cases. There are a few times that when the car was turning too fast, the mount lost its grip. My dash is not too steep. I suspect that it will have problem if the dash is much steeper."
1,Garmin Automotive Gps Friction Mounting kit,Note:This product came up when I did a search for the dash mount gps model c330. This won't work with that unit (doesn't come with any cords or power). Buyer beware if you make a mistake and order this from Office Depot/Tech depot. No way to cancel order (even 5 minutes later) due to mistake. Very poor communication and customer service policy. Notice there poor performance compared to other sellers. Buyer Beware!!!!
4,Good addition to Macbook Pro,This product does as advertised--protects the Mac and it really feels better to the touch than the metal case. Well worth the price.
4,movie,"preachers wife is excellant.... Whittney Houstin classsic, so glad i ordered it. Other movie is just OK, but I purchased this for Preachers wife."
1,"a good idea, but the sound is horrible","A nice idea and design, but the sound of this toy is horrible to terrifying and is more suitable for a car alarm. At this time and age having this quality of sound in a toy is simply unacceptable. I am returning this toy."
3,Cartoon Network,I was looking for the cartoon Prometheus and Bob and this came up. I wondering if this was the old bate and switch.
3,Don't nest well with each other,"The bowls are sturdy and look nice. But they don't nest well with each other. Or maybe I should say, they nest *too* well? If you stack them, The lip of the lower one touches the bowl above and creates, pretty much, an air-tight seal. Then, it's very difficult to separate them sometimes due to the vacuum effect. This happens whether the bowls are dry or wet, but more so when wet. I've had to bend the bowls a little to separate them. Very annoying. They should have flared out the lip of the bowls so air can get in between the bowls. Poor design. I do not recommend these if you are planning to buy more than one."
5,Charlie Bear dog treats,Fast shipping My dog loves your treats! I will be ordering some more very soon! I like all the varities you have to offer!
4,Great training treats,"We use these treats to train our dogs for new commands. For example, we leave a bunch by our bed, and then the command ""bedtime"" means to go up to the bedroom and lay down in their dog beds, which is followed by several treats.They learn so quickly with frequent rewards, and these are so small and light that they catch them right in their mouths, without unneeded calories!"
5,"fast delivery, good condition",I bought this book because i needed it for my class. It was a fast transaction from purchase to delivery.
1,Wow! this is bad!,"What did she do to her voice? It's sounds like .... This is the worst Rainer Maria has ever released. Don't buy this! Buy Look Now, Look Again or Better Version of Me, but not this!"
1,Recommended? No way,"This title was selected by my 25 member reading group when they were seeking something humorous to read and discuss. They were both shocked and amazed that this book was reviewed so highly. Not one member found a single redeeming quality. The characters are unbelievable caricatures; it is cliche ridden; the ""plot"" is pointless with a ""nice tidy"" if abrupt ending; and the dialog seems to be straight out of every 1970's TV sitcom! What a waste of time!"
5,Great Product,We needed to replace this part on our Generac generator. Shipment was quick and the part performs just as well as the one we replaced. Ordering was quick and easy.
3,Good book,It has been awhile since I read the book. I have read several books by the author and have not read one that I don't like.
4,Vivacious early Beethoven from Schiff and Haitink,"This is a bargain reissue of two concertos, the First and Second, from a complete Beethoven cycle that Andras Schiff did with Haitink in Dresden. I almost always find Schiff's pianism too fussy and underpowered, but there is no denying his bent for classical style. If you think that correctness is a virtue, you will be delighted by these brisk, vivacious readings imbued with sophisticated musicianship. Haitink is fully in tune with Schiff's lightness, and the Dresdeners play elegantly but with undiminished energy.In all, this is a very successful pairing, and I kept back the fifth star only because in the end I think Beethoven is a romantic, even before the full flowering of his maturity. For anyone who sees these two concertos as extensions of Haydn, however, there's no reason to hesitate in buying Schff's version. The recorded sound is clear but with a hint of digital glare and smudging of the piano tone."
3,Not compatible with Early Engineers engines.,"Lots of fun and my 2 & 5 year olds love to watch the trains go flying in and out of the tunnel. However, my 2 yr old gets very frustrated that some trains will not fit through (since he doesn't understand which ones can/cannot fit); we have a couple Early Engineers engines that are a fraction of an inch too tall to fit through the opening. They catch on the opening, which causes the rest of the train behind it to derail. Also, if you have other wooden railway engines that are slightly higher than a regular Thomas (like Harvey) they will get stuck."
5,My daughter loves this book!,"We read this all the time. She loved it so much that we also ordered the grandpa, mommy, and daddy versions. (I was a little disappointed that the mommy and daddy ones included several religious references - going to church, etc. - that might not apply to every family, but the grandma and grandpa ones don't have that.)"
1,Second only to Precious Moments in ugliness and dogmatic content,"All four volumes in the Hallinan series ""My ____ and I"" suffer from googly, balloony illustration and such torturously forced rhymes as could only have come from utterly uninspired use of a rhyming dictionary. Two examples: From My Mommy and I: ""We like to dress up and go out to church/We like having picnics in the dogwood and birch."" For My Daddy and I: ""We like telling stories/We like pedal cars/We like sharing cares as we stare at the stars."" See a pattern here? In addition, two of the four volumes refer directly to ""church"" and one specifically to God. I am sorry that I read any of the four of these cloying, ugly volumes even once and am glad to have ""disappeared"" them before my child was old enough to have experienced them. If you do happen to be a lover of Precious Moments, however, then these are definitely for you."
5,I JUST LOVE IT,I JUST LOVE THIS STROLLER ITS AMAZING I LOVE THE STORAGE BASKET AND THE FACT THAT I CAN PUT MY GRACO INFANT CARSEAT IN IT THE DESIGN SOESNT MATCH THE STROLLER BUT IT FITS LIKE ITS SAPPOSED TO THATS ALL THAT MATTERS. THIS STROLLER IS VERY EASY AND CONVINANT TO USE. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
2,Disappointing,"This carriage is okay. I do not like the way it folds horizontally. The tray hits the ground very hard. I only use it occasionally, so I won't spend the money to return it. I am also sorry I didn't purchase a stroller with a five-point harness.I am very disappointed with Graco."
2,Bad design !!,"I bought this Graco stroller from Amazon & it arrived in a good package. It was very easy to assemble but we found that some of the parts were dented.The stroller is very easy to unfold but the negatives are:1. The tray hits the ground and can get scratched.2. Also, always get the dirty wheels on our dress while loading in the trunk.Overall, We're disappointed & will not recommend this to anyone."
1,Very Cheaply Made and No Adjustability,"I bought this stroller for my first baby just because it is compatible with my Graco carseat and the low price. However, after installing it, I figure that there's almost NO adjustment can be made to the seat nor push-handle. The only adjustment is the storage basket on the bottom and folding it down for storage. I'm really sickened everytimes I look at this stroller. The back angle is either too low or too upright, NOT confortable at all!! I can already foresee that my baby will have the tendency to fall forward due to this stiff back angle (too upright). It is a pain in the butt to follow through the crappy instruction pictures, and now that I'm not completely satisfy, I can't return the item back to Amazon due to it being too big to fit back into the box.\PLEASE, if you love your baby, don't spend $60+ on a stroller. Get a GOOD one!!!"
5,Choral Music,Very moving and inspiring recording by one of the best cathedral choirs in England. The mix of contemporary and traditional settings for Evensong is a perfect introduction to this characteristically English church office.
5,Best TP to use if you tend to have frequent UTIs,"Okay, not the most romantic or fun product to review but I am putting my $.02 in because Scott is the only toilet paper I use for one very good reason. Every other paper I have tried tends to provoke a UTI in me... our doctor says the softer papers contain more loose fibers, often of unknown content and in some people the fibers in the softer TPs do tend to irritate ""sensitive areas""... which can cause bladder infections and UTI's in general in some people. Bottom line, softer is not always better...and frankly Scott is not only stronger, it lasts a lot longer, and in the long run it is cheaper to use than those cushy ones."
1,Way overpriced!,"The warehouse club price for this brand is $0.61/roll. Even before shipping and with the 15% subscription discount, this is $0.83/roll. So, it's 36% more expensive here than at Sam's Club. The house brand is even less expensive, at $0.42/roll. So, you'll pay a high price for the convenience of having this delivered!"
3,An easy Sunday read.,"A good story, if you like a book that is an easy read. A bit far fetched, but, what the heck?"
5,Well written and enjoyable reading.,Cat lovers would enjoy this book. Kept me wondering throughout. Makes me want to read more of her cat books.
5,For all who love cats,"Very good mystery. The Boston/Charlestown area described perfectly. A 30ish reporter mourning the death of her beloved cat, stumbles upon an elderly cat lady. She returns several days later to interview her and finds her cats agitated and the elderly woman dead on the kitchen floor......From there the twists and turns will astound you and you wont see the end coming"
4,A good read,"This was a really good book and well written! The mystery kept me hooked. I didn't want to put it down. This is a good book for cat lovers or mystery lovers, or both!"
3,Okay...predictable,"I gave this three stars because while the story and the characters were okay, they did not pull me into a ""must read"" situation. I chose this book because I am an animal lover, especially cats, and I volunteer in a shelter. I was hoping for more from the story but did not get it."
4,MEW is for MORE than just murder,This book is a BIT slow but it WILL keep your interest and by the time you get to the end you will wish it was longer. I SO enjoyed it and can't wait to read # 2 of her books!
2,Catfox,"Not too bad. I did not guess the killer until close to the end, which is good, as you can often tell who is going to be the bad guy in the first chapter or two. But the action was slow. It is kind of a one event book. An old woman is found dead. The rest of the book just sort of deals with that event. OK bit not great."
2,Mew is for murder,"An updated version of the ""cat who...."" series. It was interesting that the story took place in the Boston area. I also liked how the author brought the heavy rock scene to the book."
3,Cute - Good Light Reading,"Mew is for Murder was a nice, light read. There is something about the way this author writes that kept me going even when the descriptions of the clubs the protagonist went to and the music she listened to in them became way too drawn out. Trying to keep Theda's club scene acquaintances straight was also tiresome.The mystery aspect was okay, if a little trite. I would definitely seek out and read more of this author's works in the hope that her craft has been more thoroughly fleshed out."
3,Small,This says soup/cereal bowl. That might be the case if your a skinny four year old but anything else it's nowhere near a soup or cereal bowl. Way to small for that.
2,Where was her editor?,"My son (nearly 9) and I consumed Pure Dead Magic and Pure Dead Wicked! We were so excited to discover Pure Dead Brilliant was coming out that I pre-ordered it in hard back (something I never do). Unfortunately we barely made it through a hundred pages. Ms Gliori is, indeed, brilliant (!) but we had two major problems with this book. It's darker than the others in the series (too dark for a 9 year old?) and, despite the wonderful characters, is horribly over written. Where was her editor! The long flowery sentences, packed with adjectives and adverbs, killed the humour and our interest in the plot. I struggled to read them, and my son struggled to listen. It seemed every few minutes one of us was saying ""wait a minute, what was that?"" Or, in our less intellectual moments, ""huh?"" Finally we gave up. Despite the $18. And went back to The Roman Mysteries series by Caroline Lawrence, with hugh sighs of relief."
3,A good recital marred by amateurish CD presentation,"This recital was recorded 1995 at the University of Cambridge and covers a broad selection of Spanish vocal music from between the world wars. Although Granados and De Falla are fairly easy to find on disc the same cannot be said for the other composers most of whom are usually represented only by guitar or piano music. The only problem with this CD, and one which for many will spoil the recital, is the decision of Herald (a small UK independant) to omit texts and translations. Some of the songs, such as Espla's Pregon - a collection of street vendor cries, or Mompou's Combat del somni - based on a Catalan poem, and others, are difficult to follow without texts, and Campos' sensitive treatment of the words is lost. The notes are over brief and in English only. Alternative recordings are available: Espla (Pappas with Espla himself at the piano), Obradors (De Los Angeles), Turina (Caballe)."
3,what is this movie?,"well, i guess the editing made it bad( i watched it on tv). but honestly, i think Andy is getting old.......the storyline is simple, King, a gambler, is color blind and is looking for his lost wife and son. He meets dragon, whom was told to take care of King and be his apprentice or soething to make some money. The story goes to tell you how King falls in love with Dragon's sister.mediocre movie....andy lau didnt fight the way i want. but i still got love for this guy tho...check out fulltime killer"
3,Ok,Pretty much strictly for looks. It is extremely lightweight and can break easily. Also had to fiddle around with the alignment and headlight to get this to fit correctly.
4,R & B for me!,"This is a brilliant album with soulful tunes that represent a mix of summer tunes and blissful beats to chill out to. It mixes some of Englands best such as Craig David with our Amercian counterparts. Particular tunes to look out for are ODB and Lil' Kim, Toni Braxton and the new and fantastic Kelis. This album is phat, fab and frankly worth its price, so go buy!"
2,Not worth the money,"This toy is all of 3"" long. The image portrays a much bigger toy and you'd think by the price you'd get something more than a small wooden block carved to be a tractor and a miniature Bob. Spend your money on something else from Bob the Builder. In order to have fun with this you'll need to get the other characters in the set and at [the price], it won't be [inexpensive]."
2,Waste of money,"After 20 seconds, the kids got bored with this and eventually all the pieces could not be found. Disappointed with this product."
3,Okay for awhile.,"My kiddos got very bored with this toy very quickly. They got it for Christmas and it's just a mess everywhere. They only play with it once, then dump the pieces everywhere and leave it all on the floor. Nicely constructed but leaves a lot to be desired."
2,Do Not Buy Online!! Crap for quality,"Melissa & Doug have fallen FAR from their humble garage and sad to say, so has the quality of their products. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the quality. The magnetic net looked like it had been cut with a dull jigsaw! It was very obvious that whoever made this product, does/did not care at all about craftsmanship(probably cause they're a prisoner in some chinese work camp)"
5,Great product!,Needed to sharpen a few of my scissors & this product worked fabulously! I wish I'd found it sooner. I love it!
2,ISqueez just ok,This product is ok. Its simple and works well for a regular IPOD. Dont bother if you are using it for a NANO.
3,Ok headphones,"I love the extra long cord length, which is good for running. If your like me you hate to have a cord flopping around all over the place in front of you. Hoever the cord extender died on me several months after purchase. I bought mine at bestbuy. I'm still considering getting another pair, just because I loved the cord lenth so much."
1,"Great fit, horrible quality","Worse sound quality than regular earphones that came w. my ipod. Plastic cracked at the hook / earphone joint on both R & L sides. This after I used them only 3X. My $20 Sony earphones w. secure hooks didn't fit quite as well, but they lasted many years & had far better sound."
1,DO NOT BUY!,The durability of the Nike headphones are awful.The wires shorted out in 5 months!Complete waste of money!!
5,Rocki'n From Madison,"Theses guys were totally under rated, They should of had Motley Crue as there opening act. I know these guys and have seen them maney times at the annexx in madison wi. this album is excellent and if you ever get the chance see them in person."
3,A Few Good Songs,"I did not enjoy this volume as much as the others. I really purchased it just for the Tokens appearance which I wanted my three grandsons to see as they really enjoy ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" that is on a CD I burned with my favorites. Keep the music going."
1,star for illustrations only,"This book's text is dreadful. Incredibly wrong information, ridiculously mislabeled pictures including these ""gems"":1)mid 1880's Fashion illustrations captioned as ""Fashions from the 1850's as portrayed in Godey's Lady Book"" (Having access to Godey's I can also vouch they are most certainly not from Godey's as well. They appear instead to be French- the high quality color printing gives that away.)2)A Fashion illustration from the later 1820's is captioned ""In the 14th century belts and sashes served as waist restraints, prefiguring the more severe cinching that would follow.""3)A circa 1750 fashion illustration is captioned ""The 15th century farthingale was so restrictive it disappeared from Europe by the early 1600's"""
4,Grandson loved it!,"My grandson's favorite piece in this set was the little watering can. He used it away from any sand/beach to keep watering my plants year round! (was a great size so that when filled, his little arms could still manipulate it well). Its just as described and I recommend!"
2,Disappointed,Insightful and articulate thoughts but the book tends to be repetitive and bland. The overall thesis could be stated in a much smaller text. Some of the terminology is quite comical.
2,Nice Vintage Pictures But,I have seen pictures of full nude women for sale from this period on ebay but after getting this book the full nude women are very few & far between so do not buy if you are looking for vintage nude women showing pubic hair photos from that era.
3,Great Performances but Audio Stinks!,"I watched and recorded both of these wonderful events off PBS when they first aired. The performances are all priceless. That said. I don't understand why the audio on the off air performances was so good while the DVD's are terrible. I have been in the technical end of the TV business for 40 plus years and have have participated in many post production sessions. It seems that the producer or the audio person/editor opted to mix ambience from the auditorium into the DVD product that was not in the PBS aired versons but he/she over did it. The result is a sound that puts the listener in the very back row of the audience or, in the lobby. It's a shame because the performances were well miced. I would have expected much better from the folks at RHINO.Tony"
3,not much new stuff,"While I am a big Oh! My Goddess fan I was find of disappointed with this release. This volume features the last of the stories that weren't released in the original couple of volumes. But this one has only features two stories that arn't in any of the other volumes. They're good stories, but I was expecting more. Still if you haven't read any of the earlier volumes this is a good buy, but if you're like me and already have 1-555-Goddess, I wouldn't bother unless you really like the series. But if you don't have 1-555-Goddess, likly because its out of print i think, then you should get this one if you're a fan of the comic."
3,step by step,Good starter book. applications & examples center around marketing buisness. If you looking for other uses you will need to simulate.
5,first one the timer was broken BUT amazon refunded my money and sent a new one out to me works fine,first one the timer was broken BUT amazon refunded my money and sent a new one out to me works fine
5,"THE TOWER OF POWER, RIGHT ON TIME.","THIS IS A GREAT POWER PACK, WITH 300 WATTS, YOU CAN INSTALL ALL THE LIGHTS YOU NEED TO GET THE NIGHT TIME LOOK THAT CARS & PEDS STOP TO TAKE IN. YOU JUST ADD UP ALL YOUR LIGHT WATTAGE, AND NOT TO GO OVER 300 WATTS, AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO WITH YOUR INSTALLATION. PLUS AMAZON SOLD IT AT A WONDERFUL PRICE. THIS TOWER OF POWER WAS RIGHT ON TIME FOR THE SUMMER."
5,this is a very good product.,"My first review was ""time will tell"" and it has held up perfectly.I do have another Malibu powerpack/timer that I have had for 8 years that is still working perfectly so this should be a good example of reliability."
2,Problem with floodlights,"In October 2009 I ordered a 300-watt power pack, nine 11-watt landscape lights, and five 20-watt floodlights. I set them up in my newly landscaped backyard and they looked great! But to my dismay within six months the floodlights stopped working. The tiered landscape lights are fine.I've since tried to solve the problem by calling the customer service line listed in the packaging. But their phone message instructs me to call Malibu, which brought the product line. I called Malibu, but they said they not responsible to the old product and told me to call Intermatic. I've been on hold for 15 minutes with their customer service line as I write this review."
2,Missing Parts,"I bought this product and after two weeks it finally came in. So I waited until it was a little cooler and started to install. Found out in the middle of the install the set was missing parts, which meant that I couldn't install them. So I called the number and they said to go to their website. I did and then they wanted me to fax them my amazon invoice.Enough of this, I took everything out that was installed and sending them back. End of story! I waited two weeks to receive them and I'm not waiting another two weeks for the parts that should of been in the box already to get here.Went to Lowes and bought a set in case it was also missing part I could just go back and get the needed parts. Think about that before ordering this sort of stuff with many parts from amazon."
2,FUGGEDDABOUTIT,"If you live in an area where there is snow, these lamps are simply not worth the time, effort or money."
2,missing parts,this products came quicker than anticipated...but to our dismay it was missing six parts and not to easy to replace..still waiting for replacement pieces...
2,Cheap set of lights - takes a long time to assemble,"I bought this back in May of 2006. OK, so I gave this two stars solely because of the price. I don't know where they are coming up with a retail of $112, but at $46 the price is pretty decent. First, expect at least a few of the lights to be non-functioning right off the bat. So, consider it a 15 light set, not a 20. The frustrating part of this set is that you don't know if the light works until you attach it to the cord with a one-time use alligator clip. If the light doesn't work, you CAN'T remove it from the cord. Dumb design. The power supply and timer are fine and work well. The lights are so darn cheap and break so easily, it makes the whole set suffer. It took me at least 4 hours to assemble everything and lay it out. Not sure what else can be said. Roll the dice and see if you get lucky."
4,"Excellent value, assembly was a breeze, all parts accounted for even w/poor packaging.","Finally working on my back yard and tying it in with the front yard, so I needed lighting. Ordered the 14 lights, 6 flood 88 watt power pack for $ 45 off of Amazon because shipping is free! Finished putting it together a few hours ago just before dark with excellent results. Assembly is quite easy after hooking up a few lights it got to be so easy! However, after turning it on, the 4w bulbs are just a bit weak and am already planning on getting a 300 watt power pack replacing my 88 watt power pack. I guess I'd like it a bit brighter. So, I'm ordering a few 12 watt bulbs to see the difference. Good product (all plastic) however cleverly engineered to last outside despite its apparent flimsiness. I bought this kit based on the comments on this web page and I'm glad that I got this kit. These comments helped me make my decision which I feel makes a good buy!"
4,The Proper Perspective,"Yes, this toy is very high-priced for the size. However, when compared to the other branded toys of similar size that are played on wooden tracks (i.e. Thomas the Tank Engine, et al, and the BRIO system), it is economically on par. While the vehicles can be played with their own, I think the entertainment value lies in creating and playing with the toys in a Bob the Builder town, along the lines of Thomas' Sodor Island. My almost-3-year-old loves all things Bob, as well as Thomas and the wooden trains. I think we'll be starting a collection of these as well."
5,Compatible with Brio or Thomas Wooden Railways,"Do ignore the negative reviews related to the size of the toy -- this is compatible with the wooden railway system, and is sized appropriately. Of the series, Muck is the least durable, since his front scoop comes off with very little tugging, snaps back on easily as well, but one more small part to lose.very cute, especially with the scenery from the race set and set up with some railway pieces as well."
3,This IS a screenplay,"I bought this book thinking that it was a novel. Many books that are based on a movie are novels. This one is not. I just want to make sure that anyone who orders this book understands that it is a screenplay, not a novel."
4,Vanilla Sky + Abre Los Ojos = Great Cinamatic Experience,"To truly feel it's soul you must see Alejandro Amenabar's piece, Abre los ojos. I call it a ""piece"", because I feel that it's a work of art in it's own right. Now, if you view the two films and come away uneffected then never watch another film, stick to movies, i.e. Spiderman, Home Alone, etc...Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Kurt Russell, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz give performances that gel wonderfully and make this a must see.This film will challenge you, you must be prepared to think and feel, and believe me you will.Live the Dream"
2,didn't fit!,"I've had installed a Borla kit for my IS300 a few years ago. That kit was a perfect fit. This kit #14888 was a nightmare to install! I had to cut the pipes and muffler in at least three differnt places to prevent the exhaust from hitting the body of the car and to get the tailpipes centered! The kit also didnt come with the correct bend for the exhaust to fit in the stock location. I had to get another pipe bent to connect the catalytic converter to the rest of this exhaust system. It does look pretty good after it was all done. 1989 Pontiac Trans Am GTA. Like the previous reviewer said, it doesnt look like the pic."
4,5 discs that could be 1,"Don't get me wrong, Extras is incredibly funny and well-written series. But know what you're getting in this set. Each season (there are two seasons total) only has six (6) episodes! Each episode is about 22 minutes long. And yet, the studio, for some odd reason, decided to split the series onto 5 separate discs (3 episodes per disc).In other words, ""The Complete Series"" means 13 short episodes total. You do get a plethora of special features, however. But if you think you're getting a week-worth of comedy, you're not.I give it 4 stars, nonetheless, because Gervais is simply brilliant. The dry British humor and all celebrity guests are simply hilarious. I took a star away just because the series is so short and the studio could have saved a bit of plastic by condensing each season to just one disc. Then have a separate disc for special features."
4,"""Are You Having a Laugh?""","You will.Oh, YOU WILL.As far as the content is concerned, EXTRAS is the stuff GREAT COMEDY is made out of. Subtle in its dry, witty ""Tongue and Cheek"" humor, yet still retaining that irresistible, crassly outrageous-unexpectedness that one WOULD come to expect from the comedic genius of producers Gervais and Merchant, EXTRAS is one series definitely worth watching.Absolutely brilliant and HILARIOUS.If you enjoyed the ORIGINAL OFFICE, then this is sure to please.As for the DVD packaging of the set is concerned however, it's satisfactory at best as it does not exceed any preconceived expectations: if you already own the each of the DVDs seprately, then I suggest not even bothering with this purchase.But if you DON'T, then BY all means, BUY this."
1,Don't buy if you plan to play on computer or portable device,"I LOVE Sarah and was excited for the CD. I'm very disappointed that it skips on my computer, despite the fact that my system meets the requirements detailed in the CD's software. While I understand they must combat piracy, they need to find a way that works. I PAID for the CD and I still can't listen to it! I'm also disappointed that Amazon does not indicate when a CD contains this garbage, so that I'll know what NOT to buy in the future. This CD is being returned to Amazon tomorrow!"
2,"Remember When Madonna said, ""You Can Dance""?..........",".....Well to this album, not so much. For anyone expecting the non-stop electro beat of the first Remixed album, originally released in '01, this is bound to be a major disappointment.Don't know who conceived of this project, but it cracks me up to think that somebody thought that Sarah shared a fan base with the Black-Eyed Peas. I guess anything is possible-but I just don't know whom this was targeted towards. I do confess that Vox (Tom Middleton mix)has caught my attention enough to be included in a compilation I just completed and hence I'm giving two stars for it alone. I guess if you have to own everything that has Sarah's name attached to it, then be my guest. Otherwise, stick with the original Remixed. Like the other reviewers, I'm hoping she can stop playing with her husband and the baby long enough to pen some new material. Isn't it funny how being angst-free can suddenly bring your song-writing career to a screeching halt?"
1,"Terrible, cheaply made","I purchased a pair of these a number of years ago expecting them to last. They did not. They are moderately comfortable, yes, but so are many shoes. I would have expected at this price for the soles to hold up for at least a year of moderate use. They did not. For something so expensive that calls itself a ""Walking Shoe"", this is inexcusable. I walked with these shoes approximately 15-20 miles per week in good weather on sidewalks and pavement. Within 9 months the outer rubber had worn through the on both heels and under the balls of both feet. At 12 months, the holes at each section had grown to the point where dirt and water were easily getting into the shoes and walking was downright uncomfortable. I've owned shoes that were $300 less expensive than these and that lasted 5 times as long. These are, without question, the most overpriced and terribly constructed shoes I have ever owed."
1,Surprise!,The arches of these shoes are much too high for me. I could not wear them and I gave them away. I am very disappointed. I will not buy Mephisto shoes again.
2,Hitler buffs might own it; the curious should visit library,"This book is disorganized and the various topics, although related, are not cemented together with anything resembling a well-thought out, well-written structure. In what direct way, for instance, are Hitler's water colors related to the circumstances of his death? This book's most important information (who found Hitler's body, how Hitler died, where Hitler was buried, something I found of particular interest) should have been summarized in a two-page weekly news magazine article somewhere. Obviously, however, the authors felt that to read their exclusive but well-padded research should cost at least $20 or so, therefore, here it is, in book form. History buffs may want this book for the inserts and for what few pages actually contain fresh, well-presented information, but the curious who just want to know more about Hitler's last days should visit their library or borrow a copy from a friend-- who, I'm sure, won't mind lending it out."
2,"Interesting, BUT...Disappointing","This is a fascinating topic, a real detective story for one of history's mysteries. (Though the mystery angle is not so great, just some minor twists and turns.) There is much in this volume that has been covered before---and done better (Trevor-Roper and O'Donnell, for example). The authors' arguments are poorly stated, disjointed, repetitive, and not particularly convincing. (Though they are probably---more or less---correct.) There's a rushed, let's-get-this-one-together-fast feel to the book (it's typos are both numerous and inexcusable). Essentially, what we've got going here is a refresher course. Interesting enough, but the billing far exceeds what's delivered between the covers."
4,Don't judge book by it's ugly cover.,"After seeing their report on the learning channel, I decided to read the book. I was not disappointed. It is chock full of little blurbs of information about Hitler and his last days in the bunker. It comes across as an extremely long magazine article instead of a heavy ""study"" undertaken by college students. I recommend it as fluff reading for a vacation getaway, but for sincere hitler nuts its not enough."
2,Not worth it.,"Didn't run on Vista even after I downloaded new driver. Complicated set-up. Instruction manual was in every language but English. Power cord kept disconnecting. Worked in XP, but quality of mic wasn't great. Bought the snowball mic instead. It was easy to use and better quaility."
2,"cheap mic, headphones and stand...","I'm the type of person that takes my time and really searches out the best possibilities before purchasing. When the Samson ""plug and play"" co1u and 3, for whatever reason didn't work for me I was so sad but thought well, I've heard good things about this product so I tried it. Although it works with my computer the sound quality is awful. The headphones, mic and stand are very cheap, which wouldn't be so bad if the sound quality was better. Sadly I cannot return it due to policy. However, I'm sure I will be able to use the audio interface and mixer."
5,"Excellent product, clear sound, almost easy set up","This is the first podcast kit I ever bought, if you don't count the 3 usb headsets to purchased before. A video I found online helped me configure everything. The sound is nice and clear (Stop the fighting in Gaza!) and works well with Skype. I would purchase this again. Once I get the hang of all the features, I'm sure I'll upgrade if Behringer has another model. If you are serious about Podcasting, (End the fighting in Palestine!) I recommend this product."
4,"Good, of course, but looooong, like all of Irving's stuff","Most people love Garp and Owen Meany. Me, I like Cider House and Widow better.Irving sure can write a good story, and he never leaves a loose end; everything in his books is there for a purpose, and there's virtually no such thing as an insignificant character or event.Cider House is really a morality play beginning in an orphanage that fronts for an abortion clinic. Homer, one of the orphans, grows up there, leaved to follow a girl he's fallen in love with on 1st sight, and becomes beholden and attached to her, her boyfriend, and her family, a family that runs 'an apple business' and hires migrant workers during picking and cider time. The story follows Homer, who seems to be following nothing much (but he's sure not leading!), throughout his life until well into adulthood, and every bit of it counts.And the movie's good, too, with Michael Caine as the infamous ether-addicted doctor in the orphanage."
3,Be prepared...,"this is NOT a quick read. As with the reviewer below me, I too would have put this book down if it wasn't for the fact that I feel the need to finish every book I start. The truth of the matter is that I really did enjoy the book. The first 250 pages were the hardest to bear. It wasn't so much boring as it was just slow. Mr. Irving, we do not need every single detail of every little thing. I think that was the most troubling for me. If it wasn't for the pace, the details, the time spent on insignificant characters such as the station master I could have gotten hooked early on. The second half I liked. I felt bad for Homer and grew not to like Candy. I don't feel that Irving did such a great job trying to convice us of her love for Homer. It seemed to me that her choice would obviously be....... I am glad that I finished the book, I enjoyed it, although I felt drained and depressed by how it turned out....or was it the time it took me to finish it?"
4,An insightful and thought-provoking work,"For all the hype that this book and its subsequent film adaptation have received, it can for once be said that the hype is fitting to the subject. Irving has written a powerful piece that not only entertains, but challenges the reader.The subject matter is one that will stir up controversy with many, and that is entirely the author's intent. In his presentation he is masterful: there are characters that the reader will relate to, no matter what his or her individual stance toward abortion and the issue of human choice; and there are characters that the reader will abhor. Their unique mixture in this piece is what gives it such life, and such depth.Funny, insightful, challenging. It is a book whose final 'conclusions' are not my own, but which I appreciate greatly for its willingness to examine the issues."
4,Cider House Rules,"John Irving's Cider House Rules takes issues everyone tries to avoid and throws them in your face in their rawest forms. Irving reveals everyday emotions then distorts them to fit the main characters. Dealing wiht issues such as abortion, rape, love and lonelyness, Irving makes you uneasily intreged with his gritty, disturbing but truthful details. This novel battles with the freedom of choice proving that no opinon is final until that opinon is exercised through experience. Revealing these characters, Irving takes them to their most uncomforable levels, pulling the reader along.Although a wonderful book, Cider House Rules is not your leisure reading. Be prepared to feel. As the plot advances the more you find yourself engaged in every emotion. Cider House Rules is a great book very well written and witty to say the least. 2 thumbs up for John Irving's master piece Cider House Rules."
1,Antidote for Insomniacs,"Trying hard not to fall asleep while reading this dry, depressing and otherwise boring tale. I found John Irvings characters wimpy and stale, dark and dismal."
5,The Cider House Rules.,The Cider House Rules is my favourite book of all time. A great story that spans nearly 100 years with enjoyable characters.
4,loved it,"This is my second John Irving book and I was enthralled,shocked and entertained. I avoid reading the back cover of books. I am glad I didnt in this case because had I known the main theme of this book I would not have read it. I cried and laughed at the same time numerous times (when Curly tries to get Candy and Wally to adopt him). I liked all the main characters except for Candy. Unlike other characters in this novel who tend to be good but flawed, I didnt like what Cabdy did to Homer and I found nothing redeeming about her devotion to Wally. In some many different level, this is a great novel. I read this book about a month ago and it has stayed with me."
3,Good Story but..,I loved this story but some parts really dragged I had to force myself to keep picking it up but I'm glad I did because the story itself was compelling this is the first novel I've read of John Irvings I would like to try another one.
4,Novel far better than the movie,"I first saw the movie, as I am an avid reader I thought I would read the book. The novel far more intrigued me then did the movie. Though the movie was good, it left out so much. The parts that made the novel. I understand that if they had put the illegimate child and all the abortion issues involved, the movie would probably have been rated R instead of PG-13, bringing in less viewers. I highly recommend the novel, it is suberbly written and I will definitely read another Irving book, I personally think he writes better then Dickens."
5,john irving's best,This is easily Irving's best book. The only others that hold a candle are Garp and Hotel New Hampshire. Can't recommend it any more highly.
5,A review of cider house rules,"I found Cider House Rules to be wonderful piece of literature. Irving tackled the issues of abortion and added some humor to the whole story. The book is about rules, about the rules people are given to themselves. Irving obviously has done alot of research to give a full description of the story. He gives knowledge about how to pick an apple to how to deliver a baby. I reccomend this book."
2,Enough!,I found it t e d i o u s to get through this book. The character and plot development were so s l o w. Homer's choice at the end was inevitable. The abortion issue was fairly presented and well-developed.
3,"A decent book, but too long and too unfocused","I agree with the reviewer below who said that the pace of this book slows down too much in the middle. It does. I enjoyed the first quarter and the last quarter of the book, but the middle 50% is a grind because it doesn't go anywhere, it just takes up space until the ending comes around. At times I felt like I was reading a Seinfeld episode -- a story about nothing -- without the humor.It also seemed to me that the author himself must have been sniffing a little ether while he wrote this book. The storyline shifts from one character to the next and from one place to another so fast it is hard to develop an interest in the plot. At times it seems that the author's ""rules"" include not devoting more than one paragraph to any one scene.This is the only Irving novel I have read and it is an OK book, but I don't think I will be reading any more of his works."
3,OK,This book was ok. It was mildly entertaining and I did like the ending. The characters were all very good. I got kind of grossed out by the graphic descriptions of abortions and I felt that there were too many of them. One would have done the trick.
5,the master,"John is one of the absolute masters on his instrument which flows with the true spirit of Americana. The others on the CD are his some of his usual posse, also some of the very best at their craft. This is a great CD for any musician or anybody who loves to hear real instruments played at their highest caliber. Highly Recommended."
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","This book is fun to read and tells the story of the B-52 which was conceived in 1952 and is still flying today as an operatinal bomber. It is truly and amazing aircraft. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
2,Shipped too late,This product although is good but the shipping sucks. I waited 15 days for the product and by then the rebate had expired since it needs to be sent with the package invoice and since the package was very very late I couldnt help it.so be aware of this trick that they play.
4,These Guys BURN!,"Up from New Orleans comes another dynamite recording job from Don Turnipseed, but not on his label. This is a dynamite live session of horn-driven blues featuring the energetic vocals of Luther Kent. Believe me, these guys burn, and the dynamic but oh-so-clean sound will have your jumping just like the New Orleans Hilton Riverside Hotel must have been jumping on the night of April 26, 1996, when Trick Bag was captured by Turnipseed's microphones as they ripped through standards such as ""29 Ways,"" ""Hoochie Coochie Man, "" ""Born Under a Bad Sign,"" ""I Can't Quit You Baby,"" and yes, ""Trick Bag."""
3,Good Information - Poor Source Code,"I found the information in this intermediate level book to be on par with the others in the ""Unleashed"" series (No, they are not intended for pure beginners). It was easy to follow and presented its subject matter in a clear way.However, there is one monumental problem with this book. The printed example source code is full of typographical errors. They are correct on the CD though."
5,Las Vegas Soundtrack Missing One Song!!!!!!!,I love the Las Vegas Soundtrack but it doesn't have the song that is on the main menus to season 1 & Season 2...IF anybody out there knows the name of the song or who sings it can you email me at BYOB316@msn.com Thank You
1,Poor Quality,Bob Klein may be one of the best but this video is terrible. It looks like it was taped in a basement with an old video camera. It is definately not for someone who is trying this for the first time. The video was fuzzy and the oration was much too fast. The moves are not explained and are too quick. If you are a first timer then there are other videos out there. Do not waste your money.
5,The best chocolate in the World,Milka is the best chocolate. The hazelnut flavor is delicious and the chocolate is very creamy. This is nothing like it in the states.
2,Bad print,"While the movie is a nice, slightly absurd little noir (3-plus stars), Sinister's print is the worst I've seen. Now in fairness to the company they, unlike some of their public-domain competitors, do not make claims to have re-mastered anything and their prices are more reasonable. Nonetheless, this version is taken from a source riddled with defects (cleanest print I've encountered is St. Clair Vision's)."
4,Just right for my needs.,"After breaking my trusty APS camera, I wanted to purchase digital which was simple, would take a decent picture, and would be rechargeable. This camera meets my needs perfectly. It is simple to use, not having a bunch of features I would never need or use, it takes a decent picture, takes a bit of practice to learn its limitations but does wonderful for my everyday family pictures of the kids, and the greatest benefit, it is fully rechargeable, no batteries to buy. I am enjoying this camera and I would recommend it to the casual photographer and those just needing to preserve the daily memories of childhood."
5,"One of Five ""Must Read"" Books on Information Age","Paul, former Chief Information Officer for Xerox and later Director of Defense Information, used this book to address the basic issues of employee productivity in relation to information technology. This is one of a very few books, including those by Carkhuff, Cleveland, Kelly, and Toffler, that I regard as fundamental-required reading for anyone with any authority over anything."
3,Sore Loser,I like this boot and there very stylish but they are a little pain full. The first time I wore em they tore the bottom of my heel up. They have NO kinda cushsion in them but that shouldn't stop you from buying them because as long as they have Doctor Scholls products we can always find comfort!!! I suggest that you put a shoe pad inside for comfort but overall they're adorable.
4,LIke it,I like this dvd. I rented it first and found it fun and easy to follow. I don't even feel like a total dork since the moves are easy to follow. This gives you a nice workout but doesn't overdo it.
2,I want to punch Allie in the face,"This DVD is ridiculous...I never actually sweat during the entire thing and the dance moves are too complicated sometimes and change way too fast. I feel like I have to be a dancer to learn some of these moves..plus ""Allie"" the leader is very annoying. Not for those who are super uncoordinated like me!"
4,A Workout That Surprised me,"I have to admit, I was disappointed in this workout at first. It's not your typical FIRM fare. It's very dancey and badly cued. But the dancey fun of it probalby why I kept at it. I find myself reaching for this workout when I'm so sick of my fanny lifter/transfimer that I could toss it across the room. If for no other reason than to kick the boredome factor, this workout belongs on my shake it up/do something different shelf alongside of my ""so-hokey-you-gotta-love-them"" Yoga Booty Ballet DVD's."
2,Bad influence--- Bad girls,"Hi. I'm Kristal and I'm almost fourteen. I live in the U.S.A and when i read this book not to long ago, I was shocked.This book contains a lot of innapropriate scenes. At one point, these three idiot girls hop into a car with three older male strangers. this may give girls the impression that it's ok to go with a stranger. Also, These gitls are foutreen and thirteen and they are dating 17-20 year olds. In america, it is illegal but in U.K i guess they aren't bothered one bit.Bottom line, i wouldn't recomend this book to anyone.Jacqueline is obviously not a mother and has no clue how much danger a young girl coud get into, following these retarted girls.All though, it is realistic and funy so i had to give it props. The other book, GIRLS UNDER PRESSURE was so incredibly wack."
2,the only good German is a dead German,"cannot say i wasn't warned--rose admits this is not a graceful book and he is not kidding. falls in to the all too frequent trap of viewing with hindsight events that were cumulative and indulging in speculation as to what the subject's mind set must have/could have/should have been in Rose's theory. first time i have ever seen a supposedly scholarly approach that cites ""private information"" without any clarification as a source.in the last analysis, fails to deliver on the promise set out in the title. a hatchet job."
4,Great resource for those wishing to learn more about C-SPAN.,"This book is a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about politics and the media. Rather than concentrating solely on Brian Lamb, this book takes a closer look at the effects C-SPAN has had on both the political world and the American public."
1,It wasn't what I was looking for,"I have a 1995 Cadillac Deville which keeps stalling on me. I discovered it had no spark, so it wasn't a fuel problem. I have brought it to 5 garages and no one can figure it out. Every time I get it to the garage, it will run fine. I am a college student who inheritted a nice vehicle. I can't find a book anywhere that will show me anything electrical in it"
1,Beware,"While the intentions behind this video are clearly good, it is my understanding that depictions of the Sweat Lodge ceremony are sacrilegious.On a purely aesthetic level, the overall quality of this video is extremely poor. The image is degraded, the audio is spotty, and the choice of music is inappropriate. It is an amateur piece of work.Having said that, it is daring of this man, whoever he is (I don't believe his background is stated), to show the details of a Native American ritual. Unfortunately, there are much more creative, abstract, and non-offensive ways the information could be presented, if it should be presented at all."
5,Good,"Received this flare adapter, after having broken the original one and was unable to finish making the rest of the brake lines I needed.This replacement was good quality and held up to make six more line flares.I found it works best when you chamfer the brake line and use either brake fluid or penetrating oil so that the flare adapter won't break and is also able to come out of the end of the finished flare."
5,Enjoyable,"This was a very enjoyable book. VC Andrews may be no literary genius, but just try to put down one of her books. I think of them like candy- a guilty pleasure you can't resist.Again, this book is a struggle between good and evil. You'll love to hate several characters. And as each secret or development is revealed, you'll be shocked. If you've read other VC Andrews books, I'd give this series a chance, starting with Dawn. Or, if you like books with deceit, surprises and family struggles, I think you'll enjoy VC Andrews."
4,Christmas Classic for All Ages,"Your rating this book as for the toddler to preschool age group is like saying all movies with Linda Hunt are for children because Ms. Hunt happens to be short. This poetry collection retells 15 legends associated with the birth of the Christ Child. It inlcudes beautiful line drawings which would probably be lost on most pre-schoolers. (The drawings are present even in the paperback edition.) The poems themselves are readable and sometimes thought provoking. Some are amusing and some are song-like. A number of the pieces involve animals and their response to Jesus' birth. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a whimsical and upbeat meditation on Christmas. For children of all ages, as the saying goes. A great gift book if the publisher re-issues it. Used copies are available for both hardcover & paperback versions."
2,Lemon saw,"This particular saw I purchased just recently arrived on time, GREAT!!! Trouble is, It doesn't run, and the customer service contact is, at least at my location, ""Crawfishing"" on the Warranty work needed too get the thing running. Sure I could adjust the carb myself, but that ""Voids"" the warranty. Reminder, You ""Get What You Pay For""."
4,This Movie is True to the book as much as possible,"I am not into vampire movies but having insomnia during Easter Sunday ( yes Easter Sunday ) I was swamped by vampire movies all night even the so called good ones are pretty awful . This movie depicts persons asking God for strength & Faith to face this evil . the special effects are not great but get their point across . Unlike the Farcical Tom Cruise movie this vampire shows no reflection in the mirror , one cares for the charecters & it is well made .my friend called it the best vampire movie she had ever seen ."
3,Strange and slow,"I love the BBC and almost always enjoy their offerings but this is strange and very slow moving. It was a little jarring when they switched from location shots to set shots. Parts were very good, the actors and locations and bit players are right on. 160 minutes is also to long for this film. Some good editing would have helped; 90 minutes tops. I hope I can put it back in the machine to finish it; maybe if I'm confined to bed."
4,Almost perfect,"A great guide. Includes everything (everything I've looked for so far at least). The histories are well-written and pretty comprehensive. There's underground hip-hop too. Also, VERY up to date (I'm writing this in August of 2005). The only thing missing is an index, which would have been very helpful, especially for those of us who are still in the process of discovering hip-hop. If you want to look up an artist, you often have to know what group they started with because that's where the info will be."
3,"Raw as raw can be, but effective.","Chris Murray is not too bad really, it took me a long time to get into this but it's definatley some good reggae however i gave this 3 stars as i have heard much better reggae aswell such as king django, kwame D and of course Bob Marley but if you would consider yourself to be a huge reaggae fan then you should purchase this if you can, while the music is a little bit low on sound quality it maintains it's involvment in the music and gradually grows on you, who knows maybe in a couple of months i might enjoy it more as it has that effect on you. I first heard this in a small market type shop in my city, Hull in the UK, and loved the raw sound that it had to it you know like your actually on a beach and this is been played live behind you so it's worth having."
5,"It kicks ass, and It's the best CD I've ever listened to..",Orgy is the best band in the world and I can't wait for them to come out with a new CD or single. as soon as they do I'll be there. But I have their CD and single and am very proud to own them. I think heven is everyone listening to Orgy because they ROCK!!!!!!!!!
2,What is this?,"O.K., I love New Order's song Blue Moday, but this cover is absolutely depressing. Oh, let's try to be ever goth band we can think of."
2,just to let you know,this is a new order song so quit refering to it as an orgy song. music like this has been done for over a decade but is now recently appearing on mtv. it's nothing new or avant garde. the lead guy really reminds of gary numan. perhaps a little too much
4,Good Tape,If your into Chinese Martial arts. If your looking for a good workout combine this with something else. This is strictly the moves. What I do is take each set of moves and do them one at a time. Its alot of info and it breaks it down easier.
1,Halls of Me Me Me Me Me Me Me!,"If Halls of Fame is what publishers are calling literature these days, then I don't want to read another word of contemporary writing. This book is ugly, self-centered, immature, and complicated just for the sake of being complicated. It's as if this writer was trying to make sure the world was paying attention to him by being as obscure as humanly it is possible. I think Graywolf better go back to printing the books they used to print instead of all this name-dropping. And the author's new book, an anthology, is just the same. An anthology that's all about the person who edited it! Wow, how interesting. It's as if all the other wirters who are in the anthology are just nick nacks for his amusement."
3,competent with flashes of loveliness,"ok, ok, so d'agata has been praised to bits here i had to read the book. it IS a good read, though a bit tedious at times. you can definitely tell he has the poet's sensibility, but i very much couldn't get past the feeling that his tone was ""ooooh, look at how clever of an idea this is!"" he is clever, just not THAT clever."
1,"By chapter 5, I was in a coma.","This book could have had a plot. It did have a plot-for the first chapter. But then it took a way-wrong-turn and disintegrated into one continuous self-centered whine.Can't remember when I disliked a character as much as I disliked Carly Linton. I started to hate her because of the way she treated (or mistreated) her poor cat. Negligence in the extreme. Cat lovers won't like that.Matt Converse did her wrong twelve years ago. So she hates him, but she wants him, but she hates him. He's a creep, but he's a hunk, but he's a jerk, but he's a hunk. Imagine those sentiments repeated over and over for three hundred and ninety-four pages.If you like shallow, silly twits, and you don't like cats-this is the book for you."
2,A bit disappointed.,"I am a huge Karen Robards fan, but first came across her books about a year ago. I saw this book, which is one of her earliest. She must have gotten better at her writing skills as she wrote more books. This reminds of a first or second try. Soft and unexciting plot....the romance was hardly there at all......wasn't as suspenseful as other books of hers are."
2,not your typical AKG product..,"I was really disappointed with these earbuds. The first pair that arrived had problems, one of the buds distorted high pitch sounds and medium to high volume. The new ones that arrived were OK initially, but the distortion problem came about again after a month of use. I'm not using them anymore.Regarding sound quality, I bought these to have better earbuds than those that come with creative nano plus mp3 players. The stock creative ones sound way better than this, especially if you like to hear some bass in your music. AKG's are ok in mid-tones and trebles.I've used AKG products before and never had issues. The AKG headphones I use in studio have never caused trouble in the past 10 years. I guess this is their lowest end product, so you shouldn't expect typical AKG quality from these headphones. It breaks my heart to give 2 stars to this item."
1,Fatal Justice: Reinvestigating the Macdonald Murders,"I believe Macdonald is guilty and wouldn't waste my money on purchasing his story of events. I never owned this movie, I never seen this movie, and can't understand why I was asked to review it."
2,Reinvestigation or reinvention ?,"After following the MacDonald case and reading ""Fatal Vision"" , I wanted to read this book to see if there was any possibility of MacDonald being wrongly accused and convicted. My conclusion is that the ""reinvestigation"" while interesting is a pathetic attempt by MacDonald to pin the murders on some really sad individuals. Bad enough he killed his family but to try and convince everyone that others ( of course all now dead) were responsible is appalling. He really is a sick man and it is always shocking when some people will believe his lies. He even remarried a woman who visits him in prison and speaks out on his ""truth"". This case was always fascinating from a forensic standpoint. His story never added up to what the blood left behind told. His lies and behavior just added to all the evidence . Interesting that there are people who may read this book and actually believe it. They must want to believe everyone else is wrong."
5,makes much sense,"One of the best and most-researched , including extensive footnoting sources, of any true crime book I've read. Yeah, this is just my opinion. But along with McGinniss (author of Fatal Vision) now admitting he altered various parts of his ""He's Guilty!"" book, Potter and Bost add much rational doubt to the supposed open-and-shut case against MacDonald.[ I'm not here to debate the whole case - - just sharing my admiration for ""Fatal Justice"" book. ]"
1,Disappointing,"As a fan returning to Joni Mitchell after a long time away, I was looking for what amounted to a greatest hits type of album. Not being aware of ""Both Sides Now"", I was caught unaware when I played the album. This is not the same singer (figuratively) who sang ""Yellow Taxi"" thirty or more years ago. In comparison, this album is over orchistrated and overdone. At times, you can barely hear Joni singing over the orchestra. Folk music doesn't take well to symphony orchestras. I was very disappointed. PLB"
2,Weak and unspirited,"An outstanding selection of songs performed with none of the zest and vigor you might expect. Some of the performances are quite good, but there is a prevailing flatness to the recording as a whole. This is made worse by having two discs to get through rather than one. This is mostly pop music, and like even the best pop music, it sounds silly when orchestrated."
5,Best Teacher!,"Again, N. Ritkowsky has put together an excellent text. Whether you use it in a classroom setting or as a programmed text designed to teach yourself, you won't be disappointed. It covers everything you need to know to be proficient at WordPerfect in a ""student friendly"" manner. She doesn't leave out steps like other authors I have experienced. I buy all of her books."
4,Delicious and nutritious recipes for kids,"This kids' cookbook starts with a brief and easy-to-understand discussion of nutrition. Safety tips for kid-cooks are included, as well as a handy illustrated glossary of kitchen tools and cooking terms.But the ""meat"" of the book is the recipes. They are simple, fun, tasty and (don't tell the kids) good for you. There are sections on breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and dessert. Many of the recipes are assembly line cooking (take a banana, stick a clean popsicle stick in the end and freeze overnight for a frozen banana treat) that will be a snap for even the youngest cook. But don't get the idea that this is all ""cooking for babies."" There's a ""Sunny Honey Banana Bread"" recipe with sunflower seeds that I'm making for the family tonight."
2,Emma/Shakespeare in Love,"I enjoyed Emma very much...BUT...As far as Shakespeare in Love--I was very disappointed to find an ""R"" rated movie packaged with Emma...The nude scenes and the Sex scenes were not necessary to the storyline and were vulgar."
3,"Good sound, stylish looks","I've had these for a while now and they have been very good. The subwoofer seems to have developed a touchy RCA connection, but that's probably my fault with the way it has been positioned by a wall."
5,Happy with product,I've been using the product for years and was happy to find it available and easy to receive so quickly.
1,A Mah Jongg Handbook,"I was looking for a review of American Mah Jongg rules. This book is not that. It has writeups about many of the international mah jongg forms - japan, china and I think America.I found it very confusing - useless - and quickly put it aside as a waste of time relative to being a practical guide for American Mahjongg .."
4,A great book for learning mahjong,"I bought this book together with a Riichi Mahjong set from Yellow Mountain Imports. It was very helpful for both teaching my parents the game, as well as straightening out a few things I had wrong. the book has clear explanations accompanied by color pictures, as well as popular variations in addition to the rules of traditional mahjong. The most helpful part had to be in regards to score calculation, where the book gave a clear, step by step list as well as a chart in the back of the book for all the possible scores. it did not, however explain the denomination of bones if you upped the ""Limit"" from 500 to 1500, or any sort of ratio for popular programs you could find online, which tend to set the initial starting points to 25000 or 50000, while the book has initial starting points at 2000, (However it clearly explained everything else about those rules in regards to variations and ""doubles"")"
2,not worth it,"had it for a short while, one day i plugged in to my work place's comp and found out i lost all the files. called in and they couldnt do nething about it. had to redo my projects at the last mins. u dont need a titanium neway unless u'r really really really careless and drive over ur flash drive. there are other 1G, 2G, and above flash drives for cheaper price still run just as good."
5,perfect pen drive,smart looking....fast...robust...comes with a keychain and pocket strap...2gb sufficient for daily use...especially carry videos...-a completely satisfied customer
2,so-so,"As far as a workout goes, it's pretty similar to all the other Abs Diet workouts (including women's) so if you're looking to change up your routine, pick something else that's more fun. Also, the main instructor guy does not have all of his stuff together. He seems almost lost throughout most of it. One good thing about this DVD though is that it has options for a 3-day, 4-day, 5-day, and 6-day routine which is great. But in hindsight, I should have chosen something else."
4,I like it...,"I have the Abs Diet for Women workout DVD, but after using that for a few months, I became bored and wanted something more challenging. This one is very challenging, even the beginner stuff was a tad too hard for me. I pulled a hamstring doing one of the exercises even though I stretched beforehand. The trainer, Terry Simpson, was not annoying at all. I like how you can customize your own workout. I'd highly recommend this DVD for someone whose been working out for sometime."
3,Same old concept.......,"This book was definitely a 'first' effort by Sharon Mitchell. Four sistahs all srtuggling with men problems, nothing new. Her style of writing was too slow. No spice. The basic story was very good but very typical. The characters had no depth. I would look forward to a second 'follow up' novel as a continuation. I would like to see these four sistahs developed more."
1,I was very disappointed,"I actually read this book in error, thinking it was the selection for my new book club. That is the ONLY reason I completed it. I thought it was trivial and unrealistic. The plot was nonexistant, the ""friends"" didn't seem very friendly to me and I never quite got how they were so supportive of one another. All I got was a lot of inane yammering highlighted with cliche colloquialisms. Not to mention the whole bulimia storyline was unbelieveable to me.When I got to my bookclub, I was pleasantly surprised to know I read the wrong book! I quickly told each member NEVER to read this one."
3,A Great Debut,"I think Sharon Mitchell's ""Nothing But the Rent"" was a great debut. However, I found myself reading ""Waiting to Exhale"" all over again. I have read alot of sister-girl books but they usually have different plots or story lines. I found many similarities in this book and ""Waiting to Exhale"". The ongoing relationship with a married man. The low self-esteem with weight. The need to hold on to members in your family. These same issues popped up and were handled pretty much the same. Even though I found the book to be very similar to ""Waiting to Exhale"" I also enjoyed it. I think that the author should continue to write more books. This time be alittle more creative."
3,Nothing to run out and purchase!!!,"Typical female stuff that confronts four African American women. Although, I could relate to the characters and their situations, the ending leaves you hanging!!! Keep trying Sharon Mitchell!!!"
2,"A slow-starter, became interesting at the end! Disappointing",Did not get a good sense of what drives the characters personalities. Ending left you wondering what happened.
2,Not too impressive....,"This book was okay as far as leaving the ending unfinished. It has a good plot, but at the end you are just left hanging on... My opinion is that one should go and check it out from the library and not waste their money."
2,Great while it lasted - both times!,"I purchased my first Gateway FPD2485W 24"" monitor some 2 years ago. It died within 6 months but Gateway replaced it with the minimum of fuss.Excellent service but there was a catch. The replacement monitor would continue the warranty held by the first. Lightning couldn't strike twice I thought.Alas the replacement just died too in the same manner as the first - monitor totally unresponsive with no sign of life except the power lamp flashing on and off.This is my only experience of Gateway hardware and to be honest its going to be the last."
4,inside peek,this really is a very good dvd and well worth having. it gives you a lot of insight into the lives of avenged sevenfold and how the band got formed. there's also a lot of extra stuff on the dvd as well. all the music videos are on there as well as how they were made. it was worth it just to finally see the sieze the day video. what you won't get it endless shots of sevenfold in concert. what you will get is honest commentary about what goes into the band. i liked it. there are moments that will amaze you and moments that will make you go what were they thinking. if you're a sevenfold fan you need this dvd.
5,A7X forever!,Gives you real insight to what the band was thinking! Even after the Rev passed its still nice to see what their life is like. I would recommend it to any A7X fan!
1,Don't waste your money.,"Worst book I've ever bought. No, the first one in this series was. Bought both at the same time, because of other reviews, now I wonder what kind of people read this stuff and like it? None that I know."
2,Bella Cucina not made to last,"I purchased the Bella Cucina Rocket Blender 1 year ago. I never really used it until recently. I started making Smoothies every morning. After about one month of making smoothies every morning, the gasket for the Blending Blade broke. I have looked everywhere on line just to get another Blending Blade. No Luck. Sensio Inc. is the maker of the Blender. When you go to their web site, they have a link for ""Contact Us"", which does not work. If you want to purchase a Small Personal Blender for a low price and that will not last a year, then I recommend the Bella Cucina Rocket Blender. The motor is powerful and works great. The construction of Blending Blade is cheap. Once it breaks, you will have to go buy another Blender. Not recommended. Amazon should remove from their site."
2,Only lasted 2 weeks,"I bought this product when I was put on a liquid diet by my doctor. I used it for mixing protein shakes with frozen fruit. 10 days after I started using this product the blades were dull, and would no longer fully cut up the frozen fruit.I liked how many cups came with this, but they are useless if the blades do not work properly."
1,Broke after 2 months,"This blender worked great for 2 months, then the plastic gear that drives the blades broke apart during the blending process. Bits of chipped and melted plastic came flying out of the blender. I would not buy one of these cheaply made machines again. I now make my smoothies with a Cuisinart mini food processorCuisinart DLC-1 21-Ounce Mini-Prep Food Processor, White."
3,For the $$$ not bad,"I've used the set quite a bit since I got it, it works okay, it's not low end but it's not high end either. I'm just a guy who works on his own stuff. I'm satisfied with it over all. If your're a professional stick with the professional stuff, for the hobbist, home repair guy you're good to go with this set."
4,Another great read from Clive Cussler,Lost City is another great read from Clive Cussler. Lots of interesting characters and drama that makes it hard to put this one down.
3,Lost City,"It was a very good read. Clive Cussler is one of my favorite authors, after I check out the James Patterson books he is the next one I check out."
4,Lost City Lacks Punch,"Having read all of Clive Cussler's works, his newer series seem to lack intensity and detail of the original Dirk Pitt novels. He has traded the depth and direction of the Pitt character for a repeating scenario in the Numa Files. Lost City was almost a carbon copy of White Death, save only a change in location. Interesting, but not a page-burner. Bring back Dirk Pitt!"
4,Great book,"If you're looking for a good story with plenty of action and a great plot and you're not really concerned with the difference between so-so writing and good writing (this book is so-so), then this is an excellent book. I couldnt put it down.I gauge the rating of a book by one thing; Am I able to truely come into the story? I am able to do this if the writing and word usage is at or above a certain level. I was able to ""come into the story"" when I read this book and to me, that provides for a good read. Bad writing can prevent this experience but I didn't think this book was too badly written."
3,Mediocre,"I am frankly disappointed with this purchase. It is a clumsy read and even for someone like myself, a mathematician with Ph.D. the technical language is hard to follow"
3,"Ethan Bortnick, your the best","My 2 year old son watches zero TV, but watches this over and over. For the longest he could only see it at the baby-sitters house as they had it on their DVR. I tracked down the DVD for Christmas so now when we need the electronic baby-sitter we can thank Ethan Bortnick.even though it's not my thing, if this inspires my son to enjoy music, I am happy with that.-Mark"
2,Contrived and boring.... mostly.,"There is no use comparing one album to another (i.e. this album is not as good a DogManStar). What's the point? Each album is individual and needs to be regarded on its own. Unfortunately, ANM is weak. For the most part, ANM seems contrived, cliched, and boring. There are a few tracks that are quite good (Lost in Space..etc) and some that surprise (..Morning); however, most are painful (all the singles so far and the awful When the Rain...). Personally, I'm fond of the song Streetlife. ANM is worth a listen, but do not expect too much. Listen to Suede's other albums - or treat yourself to one of last year's best albums: Pulp's We Love Life."
5,Wonderful!,"Robert Lyons teaches acupressure very clearly so that even beginners can learn easily. This is a great tape. The quality is very good and Lyons shows many acupressure points, the effect of each and which points to use for which ailments. He describes how to find each point and use pressure properly. Mr. Lyons also explains the basic principles of Chinese medicine and the meridians of energy. If you are even the least interested in acupressure massage, this is the video to get. I'm very impressed with Mr. Lyons teaching ability and his knowledge."
5,Babar and His Children,"This classic is enchanting. It's sweet with several anxious moments for the characters. Babar and his family are good, kind, and worth knowing. The children are like children anywhere; mischievous and without adult wisdom. They are not the all knowing ones, the parents are. Fancy that."
5,A good first novel,"This is Karin Kallmaker's first published novel and for a first, it's very good. All the humor and sincerity that will become the most enjoyable features of all of her romance books abound in this early effort. The plot is solid, the characters the kind of women who could live next door. It's set in 1978, in the year when the gay rights movement was galvanized by the murder of San Francisco's Harvey Milk. Both women are coming out during this difficult time and I liked the historical context of what coming out then was like ... it was a different world and the times were riskier. So much has changed, and so much hasn't.This early effort lacks the richness of language that flowers later in Kallmaker's work. But the story spins out quickly and gathers the reader closely. Her fans won't want to miss it. Compare it to her Unforgettable and see how good she already was, and then how much her talent has grown."
2,ok book.,good book needs to add alittle more especially at the end of the book. It was a sudden stop. Needs to get a little more sdetailed. It was an ok quick read
2,Not a very good Christmas Movie,"I watched the movie expecting good things from Cheryl Ladd and barry Bostwick. Very disappointed in the acting, the say the least. It was almost painful to watch this movie, and and was tempted to shut it off several times. After watching the whole movie, I wish I had turned it off. The last ten or fifteen minutes were good, but you had to watch the first hour or so to get to that point. i would have given it a 1 star rating, but the ending made me feel sorry and give it a 2 star."
2,Pass on this video,"I love the Firm series and I love doing yoga. I thought this video would be a perfect fit. Nope. She doesn't use pose names, which in unhelpful and it felt a bit cheesy. Plus, I didn't feel like I got a workout or stretched out. I would try other Firm workouts because they are great! For a good yoga video try, The Biggest Loser: Weight Loss Yoga, with Bob."
3,"Good, but not great","I absolutely love all of The Firm workout videos, so I ordered The Firm: Power Yoga. However, I'm not that impressed. It's not a bad video, but some of the moves were a bit awkward and I didn't really feel like I got a good workout. The instructor does not use regular yoga terms to describe the moves (like ""downward dog""), so you just have to watch her to see what she is doing. Although I am not a Yoga guru, I have a couple of yoga DVDs and have gone to several classes to supplement by mostly cardio & weights workouts. My favorite yoga DVDs so far are the Rodney Yee Power Yoga series, but I am always looking for something even better."
5,As Promised,I've not read the book yet. It is meant to be the advanced version of the first book The Way of Energy. But the book arrived on time and in great condition.
4,Real CDs Are Longer!,Great stuff. But if the music lasts only 35 minutes shouldn't the price be half also?
3,Basic toothbrush but good for the price,Very basic electric toothbrush but does what it's supposed to at a very reasonable cost.
5,Outstanding Results: BUY IT !!!,"Does everything it is supposed to and more. My Dentist recommended I buy a $100.+ version of this brush since my gums were beginning to recede and the plaque buildup was bad. I did my homework and decided that this unit would fit my needs and I gave it a try.Works great and I went back to my Dentist 30 days later for a followup checkup and my gums, which had begun to recede, were making a substantial rapid improvement and NO plaque buildup. He was very impressed. He asked if I had bought the Hi-Tech Elect Toothbrush he recommended for $100.+ somewhere else and I told him no, I got a good one on Amazon for under $20.Fantastic value.. Love it.."
3,Not sure I should have changed....,"At the suggestion of my periodontist, I purchased this Oral B Vitality Precision and am having a difficult time rating it. Yes, I think it does the job. When the brush vibrates at the two minute mark, I am able to keep brushing because it does not stop until I turn it off. The problem with me is that I have been using the Oral B Cross Action battery operated brush for years and in comparing this new brush to the battery operated, I believe the battery operated Cross Action brush did a better job. My mouth felt cleaner after using the battery operated brush. Perhaps if I buy the Cross action brush heads for the Vitality Precision, I will be more positive. Since the periodontist told me I was doing a great job brushing (with my Oral B battery operated), perhaps I was too fast to even consider a different toothbrush."
4,Works great!,"I was just about to purchase a $90 Braun after the batteries in my last $80 Braun gave up the ghost, when I came across this one. Money is hard to come by these days was and shelling out so much for a new toothbrush was making me cringe, so I ordered this one. It works great, has a built-in 2 minute timer and gets my teeth as clean as the last one. It is a bit louder and doesn't have the 30 sec quadrant timer like my last one, but it is also a whole lot less expensive. I'm very happy with it and would reccomend it and purchase another."
5,Bargain for good Dental Health!,I ordered an Oral-B Vitality Precision Clean Rechargable Electric Toothbrush about a year ago and liked it so much I purchased another recently (along with some replacement heads) as a wedding gift. This is what I had previously been giving (except the price of the others were between $50 - $60)as wedding gifts. Now that my husband has retired we've had to become a bit more 'budgety' with money and this fits right in our price range.
1,Oral-B Vitality Electric Toothbrush,"This toothbrush is unsatisfactory. Bought one on Amazon and after 4 days it did not work--Dead. Called P@G for warranty. Nice person--sent a replacement. Lasted 2 days. Discussed with P@G again. Offered to ship it back, offered to pay more for a better model. Was told that they would refund and did. Beware."
2,"Bad design, would not buy again","While this toothbrush does what it is supposed to do and the 2-minute timer is a nice addition, the design is flawed. It is impossible to brush your teeth with this brush without drooling all over the place. I believe it has to do with the width of the brush attachment. Brushing your teeth with this toothbrush is quite messy, no matter how hard I try, and I would not buy this item again."
5,interesting,this book was interesting- i found myself caring for the characters and the action was amazing
4,godzilla godzilla!,"concept albums.sometimes the word makes a man run away. sometimes it makes him salivate. whatever the case, HAI is a concept album. it's lush and expiremental and may really dissapoint some people. when i first heard it, i didn't like it. now it's in rotation in my changer at the restaurant i work at almost everyday. it's a good, cool, interesting listen."
4,"Very different from ""Animus""","The more I listened to this album, the more I liked it. I've heard that it was recorded very quickly, but it is closer to ""The Creatures"" earlier work than ""Anima Animus,"" which was a more techno-themed album.These tracks have the heavy rumble of early ""Creatures"" work, whilst still managing to be unique.The first half is very different from the second half; however I recommend the ""HAI! 2004"" release that included the B-side, ""Attack of the 50-Foot Super Vixens,"" over this one. That was a fantastic track! If you can't find that special release, the track is included on the ""Godzilla pt. 1"" single."
2,Don't bother with the sample.,"I may eventually get over my irritation and buy this book, but I just wasted time downloading and opening the ""sample."" It consists of the cover page, credits to Google for the digitizing, the names of other involved entities, and a one-paragraph comment by the author. Not even a hint as to the actual contents of the book!"
1,Dont waste your money or time with Gateway,"My warrenty expired 1 month and 2 days ago, and Gateway says Tough Luck. It worked great, and then all of a sudden nothing. I have since found quite a few postings online that all sound like the same exact problem I am having, and with the same attitude from Gateway.Go with another brand of computer. My old Dell lasted 7 years with no problems ever, and before that I had a Compaq that lasted about 9 years. Gateway was obviously a bad choice."
5,Reader from Texas,"A terrific read, in a very different way than her ""Skolian Saga"" books. The characters were well-defined and real. The author did her homework on Islam and AI. In particular, she accurately conveyed a sense of how some Muslims practice Islam without resorting to the usual stereotypes, an approach I found most refreshing."
3,Good except for missing parts,"They're pretty good barstools, once I bought replacements for several missing nuts, and I had to hammer one of the holes for the screws out because it had not been properly drilled and was too narrow. That aside though, they've served me pretty well. A little on the light side, but sturdy."
5,Bar Stools in Satin Black Finish Metal with Swivel Seat - 2 pack,"These aren't the most attractive bar stools, but they are well worth the price. They do the job."
1,The rewriting of history,"I was hoping this would be an unbiased look at this remarkable time in history, however it was just another attempt to undermine the Bible. Opinions are treated as fact in this thinly veiled - agenda driven - smear piece. One star is a stretch."
1,pathetic.biased.boring.revisionist.,"the Empire series really wandered off into the bushes on this one.i watched one so-called 'biblical authority'after another reduce the Bible to simply a fabrication of folk tales for 4 hours!.there is so much wrong with this sophomoric effort to take itself seriously it would be laughable were it not such a sacred subject.run do not walk away from this mess.the Medicis,Queen Victoria and Martin Luther are 5 star Empire sagas worth their weight in gold.if you take the Bible, Judaism or Christianity seriously avoid this leap into nonsense.you will thank youself for it.a total trainwreck."
5,a gunkholers cruising guide to florida's west coast,"Got this book from the local library and went cover to cover in a weekend just to get aquainted with it. Now I want to buy one to keep on my 32' cruiser. It has all the information you'll need to get away for a weekday,weekend,a week or for weeks at a time.Resturants,gas,deisel, pumpouts, water, anchorages are rated for weather protection."
5,"Excellent, and it grows on you","I bought this cd based upon the reviews previously written, and also my approval of other releases from Waveform Records. This work by Kin proved to be another winner. The sound is ""ambient,"" but also rhythmic, and it's musically complex enough to offer fresh sources of enjoyment even after repeated listenings.The musical styles are varied enough to avoid becoming monotonous. ""Pearl,"" with its female narrative voiceover during the first three minutes, reminded me of ""Little Fluffy Clouds,"" The Orb's best-known track. ""Triangle,"" perhaps my favorite track, is a ten-minute excursion into a trance-like vibe. Some other tracks have a heavy bass line contributing to a ""dub-like"" sound, similar to that characterizing another Waveform release, ""Earthjuice.""Overall, this has quickly become one of my favorite cd's. I now wish I could find other ambient-techno works that are similarly inventive and interesting."
2,"Misleading, buyer beware!!!","They claim it sets up in seconds, that is grossly misleading. You receive it completed disassembled and you'll have to go through a setup instruction sheet. It comes with 6 main parts with each having about 4 connections points on it, so you're looking at about 24 holes on tubes that you'll have to figure out what goes where. Secondly, they don't tell you this from the picture, but the price is for ONLY ONE! I received this from [...] and I was all excited about my new goal only to realize there is only one in the box, who buys one goal?"
5,Love,I freaking love this CD. I didn't grow up with this music. But I can enjoy it now. This music makes me happy and want to sing. I try to only play every so often so I don't wear it out.
1,Looks are deceiving,"The bag looks great, but the material is thin and the handles cheap. The first time I used the bag, BOTH handles tore away from the bag. The material is as thin as bed sheets and tears even easier. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
4,service and product,good service but the product while not being in the best of shape it is readable as as good as could be expected for the price
4,Great for small laptops,"I have owened this item for a couple of months. My HP Pavilion tx1000 fits nice and snugg.The item is just a sleve and not a notebook bag. It has one full size pocket on the back that something thin such as a folder will fit in. Under the flap, there are 2 pockets. Both are small and barely big unoough to put the power supply in.It works great for me in the most part. I use it to put my computer in when I am traveling between my house and office.It is not so great for traveling. It lacks in the padding and storage departments."
1,Not the product that they clam it is!,"Even though they show an ""Epson"" labeled product, it's not. I do have to say the company gave me a choice to return the item or not and said that it's comp-able to an Epson's cartridges. That's fine and good and perhaps some day I may want to buy their product, but I purchased two other actual EPSON ink cartridges for less money. Why can't they state in the product name that it's not an Epson product. Amazon should take a better look at their policy on how they list and describe their items. Don't hide the details somewhere although the company stated it was clearly listed correctly, if you call putting your name after the color's name. If their product is just as good as Epson's, then why not use their own label on the product listing, what are they afraid of. It may even be better than Epson's, just have the nerve to list and show your own product not Epson's."
1,Insufficient information in video.,"Mathematical formulas are not given to allow the viewer to prove for himself that Joe Newman is able to do the things which he claims. We are asked to accept, on faith, that Joe Newman's Energy Machine does as he says. A Search Engine with the words ERIC KRIEG, will give you more information."
2,Just couldn't get past the first 10 pages...,"I am a voracious reader of science fiction and fantasy novels. I buy and read a number of novels a week. So when I can't get past the first several pages and a novel sits unread on my Kindle for several weeks--even on days when I don't see anything else that interests me enough to read--then I'd say the novel hasn't made the grade.I should have probably titled my review ""meh"" as a result--I simply didn't read far enough to give it a more detailed review as the first several pages absolutely failed to grab my attention."
4,Church Service,"Very beautiful rendition of Renaissance composer Tomas Luis de Victoria's work, sung in Westminsters' characteristic choral style. Between the acoustics of the recording and the content, you actually feel you are sitting in live church service."
3,"Now rendered superflous by ""Greatest Hits""","While someone who owned this in the 80's might want it for sheer nostalgia, Blondie is much better served by the 2002 Capitol Greatest Hits CD. Pumped up to 19 songs from this disc's original 12, ""Greatest Hits"" also includes earlier cuts this album ignored, and later cuts from ""The Hunter"" and the comeback single ""Maria."""
2,the most USA commercial pop band,"oh my god,...I did not to say any silly critics, the songs sounded the same and were overplayed too much by the radio station....need I say more,...can you think alone by your selves Buddy?"
1,ocean safari,THIS VIDEO WAS NOT WHAT ONE WOULD ENJOY FOR JUST RELAXING. CHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT THOUGH. DO NOT THINK IT IS SOOTHING AT ALL
5,For Adults Only,This is the full collection of previously released Cool Devices 1-11 in one casing. Handy for saving space in a collection. Convenient for purchasing all at once. Nothing new that is not previously stated in other reviews.
2,Not as pictured,"It would be more favorable if the small 6 gm vial was shown, rather than what appears to be a large 2.75 oz bottle."
4,Her true feelings shine through in this album...,"Since Leona's last album, ""I Tried to Rock You But You Only Roll"", she's matured dramatically in her lyrics and overall style. The theme of the album focuses primarily around love and her personal experiences with the subject. Her beautiful/haunting voice compliments perfectly with the lyrics as Leona expresses her pains, losses, and happiness with love. Leona's recent self-titled album is artistically composed and it's a great album to acquaint yourself with her music."
4,Perfect for a rainy day!,"I love Leona Naess, she is so down to earth and it shows in her music and even in the presentation of this album, which is surprisingly girlie pretty by the way.As one reviewer pointed out, she does not have the strongest voice, but I think it's pretty in an erethal, light sort of way, and her voice suits the mood of the songs. These songs, for me anyway, mirror what I am thinking some of the time when it comes to relationships and so on. When I think of a voice speaking to me, it doesn't ever sound like Mariah Carey. So Naess is perfect.For the most part these tunes are slow, very floaty. A lot of the tracks are Leona and maybe a piano, guitar,drum or something. It's folksy mixed with ballad. If you are looking for THE CD to play during a:Rainy DayFinals WeekDay offWriting Sessionpick this one!"
4,Essential Leonard Cohen - Essentially,"As the title reads, this is Leonard Cohen's Essential collection, and by no means definitive. If you have to purchase one CD of Leonard's music, this would be the one get. Classic favorites include Suzanne, So Long Marianne, Hallelujah, Tower Song. All the songs are the album versions and do not necessarily represent the best version but they will certainly keep you listening for a long time."
5,Extremely happy customer,"This is a fantastic CD and the product was shipped super fast and in perfect shape, quicker than I can go to the store and buy!"
4,Essential Leonard Cohen,A bit unusual for this 63 year old but I do like the latest trends in current music. Leonard Cohen is a definate icon in the music world. I like it! I would recommend this to my friends and family too!
3,It's ok,"If you can get it cheap then it's worth it. There are some great songs in here, more good ones then lousy ones. so all in all it's just ok."
3,Be warned: These are not the versions from the radio,"In the 1980s, Juice Newton ruled pop and country radio. Her records struck a popular chord with their irresistable combination of roots rock, straight-shooting country, and slick pop. Those original recordings (14 of which were Top-10 hits) were pretty wonderful.This album contains nine of the ten songs featured on Newton's 1998 album ""The Trouble with Angels,"" with seven of the songs being newer versions of seven Newton hits, along with two songs recorded by Newton for the first time in 1998. The newer recordings are good, but they cannot match the ones from Newton's multi-platinum heyday.Fans wanting the original recordings should check out ""Old Flame/Dirty Looks"" and ""Juice/Quiet Lies"" from Raven Records, and/or 1987's ""Greatest Hits (and more)"" and 1998's ""Anthology""."
2,Why RBX? Why didnt you bring the skills you have?,"RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me."
5,This record smokes!,"This record really smokes. All comers (is that one word or two) should check it out - especially brutha J's rendition of ""Back Door"" - Peace"
4,stick with single CD,"Unless you are specifically looking for a lot of Sly, the remastered single CD is a probably better deal. I don't agree that the Riot Goin On stuff is essential, but maybe it will grow on me. The sound is very good however, and it still was a good deal."
3,Same as OEM,This is the same as the OEM one that comes with the streetpilot in the original box. I used it on my windscreen and it fell off sometimes in the heat so I returned it. The original one I had worked for a year before it failed.
1,"Great Price, Wrong Item","I purchased this suction cup from an Amazon affiliate. Their photo showed the correct item and the price was too good to be true. Alas, the picture was wrong. Amazon returned the purchase price and did not even ask for a return. I threw it away. Bad experience. From now on I will remember, ""If something appears too good to be true .................."""
5,Revealing!,"A while back I knew nothing about this subject so could not offer an opinion one way or the other. Since then, for my own interest, I have done a fair amount of research and found this DVD to be well documented and extremely interesting. To say ""the science is in"" or that "" most scientists agree with global warming"" is not true. Do your own research and don't believe everything that is thrown at you by the alarmists and warmists. This DVD goes a long way in offering the other side of the argument which is too often shut down. If you are sitting on the fence, are unsure or are confused, buy this and see for your self."
1,Continued obfuscation by big industry,"While healthy debate about global issues is important, this film is quite clearly lobsided and continues to blur the public debate on the issue of global climate change. It makes the absurd claim that most climate scientists are sell-outs (protecting their own careers) but that the naysayers are free from bias (despite being funded by big energy companies). Worse yet, they toss out the cautionary principle - suggesting that a move towards alternative energy is a way to keep developing nations poor. While the world powers may want to keep a segment of the world's population poor, I don't think they are inventing human-influenced global warming to carry out that agenda. It simply doesn't pass the smell test. Save your skepticism for this video, not the debate over global climate change (which should be ended by now)."
4,Enjoyable survey,"Agree with previous reviewer. I hesitate to give 5 stars, because I'm not expert in the electronic music field, but this CD is an eye-opener. Some of the composers (Kasinskas, Lukasik, Pamela Z and Bimstein) were new to me. Pamela Z really deserves more exposure: Meredith Monk-like extended vocals, electronics and a good sense of humor. I'll also put in a good word for Joseph Lukasik's rather ambient ballet music ""Utamaro's Dream"" (excerpt)."
2,"terrible shipping, broken nearly in half","It's a good deal, but after receiving out of the blue 3 weeks later it was a bit unnerving to see that it was bubble wrapped with one layer that had an address sticker on it, and the light casing was cracked nearly in half. To avoid waiting another 3 weeks I super-glued it together since it didn't affect the lights. I would recommend that they do a little bit better job of packing, and a tracking number would be nice instead of a 3 week+ surprise."
5,Outlaw in TX-,"Am privileged to have one of the first 10 CD's of this artist.....she is filled with life and love, and nobody deserves this more than her. Thanks for my quiet time! love ya, rjh"
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted so badly to like this book but ... I just couldn't related with anything there. Those obsessions were simply impossible to understand. Obsession towards the whales, toward obviously retarded kids, whale obsession toward human... the only thing that looked realistic was obsession between main characters toward each other and complexity of their relationship is probably the only thing that is good. But all the rest ... it just doesn't go anywhere."
2,Magical ... or empty?,"There is very little that can be said about this book without bending over backwards to find reasons to praise it. ""Magical realism"" implies the richness of Marquez, but what Mda has done with ""The Whale Caller"" is bland and generic. The description evokes no sense of place, and as far as offering a comment on ""post-Apartheid South Africa"" as the book jacket claims, don't expect it. Mda has written an allegory - a thin story which cannot support the weight of its design. Once again, instead of reading the blurbs on the back, take a few minutes and dip into the book anywhere - it doesn't matter where - and you will discover the empty sameness which permeates the entire book. It just doesn't go anywhere."
1,limited resuls,customer support was non-existent. product stopped working if large file was printed or multiple small print jobs were executed. experienced similar issues with the data transfer. had to reset by unplugging several time a week.
1,Features Advertized Do Not Work,"I bought this router over the BEFW11S4 for 2 reasons:1) It had the print server2) It supported VPNNeither of these features worked. The print server seemed to crash every time I printed more than 2 pages. I then spoke to Linksys and they said my printer wasn't certified. However, this isn't listed anywhere of what they vertify until they sent me a document after I log a case about it.As for VPN, it did not work via a DSL connection that uses PPPoE due to the fact that you couldn't set the MTU setting to 1492 as needed.I returned it for the BEFW11S4 - V2 and it's working great for VPN and then decided to use Windows Print Sharing for my Print Server connection.Also don't expect good technical support from Linksys. One out of the 11 people I spoke to was great, 2 were alright and the rest I had more idea about their products than they did."
1,Just talk to your mother!,"I thought this book had some really weird ideas that wouldn't work. Some of them might even damage stuff. I am sending this book back and asking my mom how to clean things, even though I am embarrased that I do not know already. This book is no substitute for real experience."
5,Read This One ASAP,"This novel is absolutely amazing! Not only are the characters realistic but they are also very engaging and enjoyable. It was definitely a page-turner-I couldn't put the damn thing down! Although this is Ms. Jossel's first full-length novel, she is definitely an author to watch. I cannot wait for the sequel, ""When Souls Mate"" to hit the selves. Support our African-American literature and authors-buy this novel! Be blessed. :)"
4,Saving the best for last,"This book was kinda hard to get into at first, but near the end of the book all the dirt started to come out. It was a slow read to start but got very good at the end and I can't wait for the next part to come out. The ending was full of what we love the most ""drama"". Hopefully Klarke can get her man back and put an end to Miss Meka."
5,The Root of All Evil,This book was reccommend by someone I had just met in the book store because they saw me reading a book by zane and said that they thought I would enjoy it.Needless to say i got a copy and started reading it and could not bring myself to put it down it only lasted me a day and I was mad at the way it ended at first but that quickly changed I LOVED IT and I for one can't wait for the sequel to come out.
5,"""The Root of all Evil""","This book is one of the absolute best I have ever read. I literaly could not put it down. I heard others talk about the book but I always thought it can't be that good. I was so wrong!I have all of my family and friends reading it now. This book is filled with surprises and twists. I can not wait until the sequel comes out. I am going to read her next book, ""Dollar Bill"" She has a new fan for life.TracyK"
2,Mediocre,"The author had good intentions when she wrote this book. However, the story did not have a continuous flow and too many ends were left open. The book trudged along, not really sparking much interest. Not to mention that the spelling and grammatical errors were appalling, and that was a major turn-off for me. You can't hope to be in the ranks of ""bestselling author"" if you present your readers with the work of an 8-year old, and even then, an 8-year old would easily be able to spot the errors before the manuscript went to print. Imagine what the theme of this book would turn out to be like in the hands of Eric Jerome Dickey or Zane for that matter. Explosive, that's what!"
3,As With Many Middle Books,"I really enjoyed the first book. The second gave alot of very good info into the cold world of the demons. In fact you almost feel sorry for them. The middle of the book does drag and there were somethings that seemed to be left hanging in the air that were not dealt with. But.....I do love the way she writes, although not as good as some that I recently read. Robin Hobb comes to mind. So far I am not left with that haunting feeling that Hobb seems to catch so well. I look forward to reading the last book and going on to the next of her series."
5,Track Listing,A-1. Opus 1: Come ride with me 5:49A-2. Opus 2: Mark's ark 4:46A-3. Opus 3: Midnight interlude 4:15A-4. Opus 4: On the rampage 3:00A-5. Opus 8: Ease with the breeze 5:01B-1.

4,Great low cal snack,I order this for my office and everyone likes it. I think its a great low cal alternative to chips and such. The corn and cherry berry are the favorites though.
5,Great Bike Book By Real Expert!,"This guy really knows what he's talkin' about, people! He can bike with the best of 'em and he knows how to write well, too; the perfect formula for a guide like this. Only somebuddy who's ""Been There, Done It"" as much as Mr. Partland has could create a book so tightly packed with great info for beginner and advanced trail bike folks alike. He been all across the US of A and overseas trips too.... Buy it, study it, and GET OUT THERE ON THE MOUNTAIN AND RIDE!!!"
4,Discover this music!,"Field Recordings has quickly become one of the CDs that stays in the player almost all the time. Doug's style of writing reveals possible influences by some of my all-time favorites: Beatles (of course), CSN&Y, JT & Dylan, and yet his style remains all his own. It's evident that he loves music, and has poured himself into these songs. Excellent musicianship and vocals."
3,Fairly good!,"this album contains some really good songs like ""For All Of My Life"" which is truly a heart warming love song and ""The Saddest Song"" which is also really nice.If you are not the love song type,don't buy this you'll just be disappointed but if you are,go ahead oh yeah and listen to ""For All Of My Life"" first,very nice!"
2,No fun,"I think I bought this for my daughter too late. We were going on a flight and I found this as a recommended toy for travel since it is a quiet toy. My daughter was 8 months old and looked at it for only a couple minutes. It did pack well and was very quiet, but just no fun.We did however bring blue painters tape and it was a hit!"
4,Captivating,I got this for my son who is now 7 months and he loves this toy. He can play with it for a very long time! He likes the noise of the beeds and it is very easy for him to hold.Overall a good toy that I hope will last.
5,it's the best,This is my six-month old baby's favorite toy. Her six year-old brother is a big fan too! Cannot recommend it enough. She has loved it for months.
5,Even the adults think it's fun to play with,"Our 7 month old loves this toy, and we expect to have fun tossing it around with her for years. We have not had any durability problems with it in the 3 months we've had it."
2,Recommended Age May be Off,I purchased this product for my baby based on the great reviews. The product is beautiful but it doesn't do much (you can pull the strings or have the balls roll from one side of the bar to the other). I gave this toy to my son at around 10 months and it never really interested him. The recommended age for this toy is 12 months and above. It seems from other the reviews that 4 months seems to be a good age for this toy. Maybe the recommended age is off?
2,Not what I expected..,"I bought this toy for my 5 month old, she is now 7 months old and has MAYBE played with it twice."
5,2nd Generation Loves Skwish,My daughters loved their Skwish and now my granddaughter loves her Skwish.I recently bought one for a pregnant friend and she was quite fascinated by it herself!
3,"Skwishy, but not fun","We received this toy as a hand-me-down when my son was about six months old. Try as we might, he was never interested in playing, chewing, throwing, or engaging with it. We rotate our toys in and out of storage every few weeks so we've tried multiple times to get him to play with it, but no go.As far as quality goes, the craftsmanship on this toy is very good. As I mentioned, this is a hand-me-down and still looks as good as new.The knobs are vibrantly colored with rounded edges. The elastic band is still stretchy and strong."
3,"Loved it once, but never really again.","When I went to a mommy and me group with my LO, another baby had this toy and my LO couldn't take her eyes off it. She wanted to play with it bad so I immediately ordered one. When it arrived she wasn't that interested in it and hasn't been since. Go figure?"
3,i like it more than my kid does,"we thought this was really cool, but so far our 9-month old doesn't seem to agree. when he was younger he would chew on it a bit (but it's not very good for that! the squishiness meant he kept poking himself in the eye with it). but now he's really not interested in it at all. maybe if you have a very contemplative kid that likes to sit still, this might be good. my hubby and i find it pretty transfixing, but our son prefers things he can bang together or knock over. it is good for grabbing, but he seems to prefer the big oballs over this since they roll. oh well."
3,I wish my kids liked this more,I don't know why my kids didn't like this so much. They squished it around a bit and then that was that. It didn't really hold their attention like other toys. Oh well. I guess it's a matter of what else is in the house trying to grab their attention and this one couldn't compete.
2,dissapointed,all the reviews seem so great so I bought it. I think my baby spent 1-2min with it and now it sits in a corner collecting dust. He is 10mo
2,Beige to beige,"I'm a big Mellencamp fan and this album fails to deliver. Mellencamp's pedigree would leave one to assume he will not release substandard material, but frankly John's lyrics on this album sound like he's never written a song before in his life, ""...I'm an American.....from the Midwest"" feels like he was forced at gunpoint to write this lyric. And many more. The album succeeds only in its consistent starkness, but is in no way the first to arrive to the funeral...The reason why this album fails so miserably is because it's a Mellencamp album and I've come to expect more from him and I'm surprised he let this one slip through the cracks in the record company. So sad.Bernie, Calgary"
1,This guy is just bad,"He wrote about 3 songs in the eighties that were alright, but he is just not good. I would not buy an entire album of his. There are much better artists out there that leave him in the dust."
4,GOOD CD OF COURSE,"THE SONGS, THE MESSAGES ARE ""MADE IN MELLENCAMP"" TRADITION.ROCKS,ROOTS WITH A SEVERAL SONGS AT THE TOP(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)BUT NOT ENOUGHSONGS2007 ""une bonne année "" HOWEVER.I HOPE A LITTLE TOUR IN FRANCE"
3,Freedom Road Album,The songs were poignant and reflected the feeling of disillusionment with the violence and other problems we see in the world today. Good listening when you are in a reflective mood.
2,too hard,"I got this because I wanted some fun exercise, and it was recommended by other reviewers as easy. But the footwork was too difficult for me. It wasn't well explained or demonstrated and the leader went on after only 2 repetitions. Not for me."
2,Dance Yourself Thin,I was disappointed with the CD. I was expecting a workout that was more high energy to make me sweat. It wasn't hard enough and I barely broke a sweat. More for beginner fitness people.
2,Not what I thought I was buying,When I was pregnant with my first child 7 years ago I bought this calendar at wal mart but it came with a bunch of stickers and it made it a lot of fun keeping track of everything but without the stickers its just boring I wrote in it once and dont even use it any more.
3,Cute but Lacking,"The reason I gave this cd 3 stars is because of the songs. The girls of Triple Image have so much potential, but their managers (or whoever picks their songs) gave them such lame songs. The mixes of bubblegum pop and rap just doesnt work. I hope that their next cd has songs that are more like Jump5's or Play's. Brittany, Brianna, and Brigette are awesome singers and dancers and deserve better music to perform. Of you are looking for anything more then shallow lyriks, a sad attempt of rapping, or so/so vocals then skip Triple Image and buy Play's ""Don't Stop the Music"" which is probably the best tween pop cd out there."
5,Triple Image is AWESOME!,"This album is soooooo much fun! I absolutely love it. My favorite songs are Never Gonna Stop, Last One Standing, None Of Your Business, and Celebrate. I have been waiting soooooo long for this album and it's finally here! I loved seeing Triple Image on the Aaron Carter tour. They were the best! Everyone should get this album! Brittney, Bridgett, and Brianna rock!"
1,We Truly Are in the End-Times!,"I received this as a gag gift for Christmas. This CD is too pathetic for words, but alas! I shall try...let me begin by saying that these girls must have a close relation in the music industry. Certainly they did not get a contract based upon talent. They cannot sing! I even tried listening to this lame piece of work while drunk and it didn't help. I plan on throwing this in the next yard sale I come across. I'll price it at 10 cents, but I'll bet it still won't sell."
3,Absolutely loved my 1st one!,"I absolutely loved my first Swiffer Sweeper Vac! I had it for over 4 years, used it everyday, 3-4 times a day, and rarely picked up a broom. This thing was great!It finally died on me about 3 months ago. I promptly went and bought another. Sadly I think this one is a dud; it does not work nearly as well. Gonna give it one more try --hate the thought of having to go back to a dusty broom and dirty dustpan :-)#3 is another dud! I guess they don't make them like they used to :-(Too bad, I really did love my first one."
3,battery does not last long enough between charges,I was so excited when I purchased this item and could not wait to get it....then it arrived and I used it and I loved the way it worked then all of a sudden the battery died in the middle of cleaning my floor. I initially charged it for 24 hours and the battery lasted for approximately 15 minutes- I wasn't even able to do my living room and kitchen (which is not very big) and now I have to wait 12-18 hours before I can use it again. I am disappointed in how this product performs in the way of battery life but liked the way it picked up dust and dirt. If you have a very small kitchen or just using it for touch-ups it's perfect but if you need to use it longer than 15 minutes you're out of luck!
2,Not all that happy with this item,Works great for about the first two months. I keep it plugged in when not in use. I have a 600 square foot studio. After the initial charge it works well but in about a year's time it will not hold a long enough charge to run through my entire studio (like it used to when I first purchased it).Honestly I would be happy with a corded version of this device so that I would not have to worry about dwindling power as time goes on. If this item came with an electrical cord and the power was consistent I would give this product 5.5 stars. I do not need to spend $35 on a vacuum sweeper that will wind up in the garbage in about 12 months. It really is wasteful and unnecessary dumping of plastic and metal materials into our landfills.
1,not worth it,very disappointing. if you want to push the dirt from one area to another this will do it. what it does not do is clean. the pad gets dirty immediately and is useless there after. it also leaves terrible streaks on the floor no matter what. wish i did not purchase it.
1,Not worth it,This item sucks. It takes 16 hours to charge it and it only works for about 15-20 minutes. It doesn't have enough power to clean my small (~900 SF) apartment. I have to do it 1/2 at a time and charge the thing again and finish off the apartment the next day. You're better off paying about $60 for a real floor vac because this one is useless.
1,Did not care for it,"The item will be in the charging mode, more then in use. First time 24 hours, works for eight, then 16 hours after wards to keep it going. Didn't want to make Con ED rich."
4,It works out very good!,"We recently installed Laminate Floor and is looking for a good floor cleaning tool and found this one. After using it, found it very good and convenient. The only shortcoming is that it takes many hours to charge each time."
2,The Swiffer SweeperVac Doesn't Suck,"I bought my first Swiffer SweeperVac in 2009. I loved it for my hard wood floors. It was powerful enough to pick up dust and small particles. It kept the charge for at least an hour. After two years of nearly daily use i decided to get a new one. The newer version does not perform the way the old one did. It does not hold a charge for more than 10 minutes, and the front part that is meant to suck up the dust does not stay down, so all I end up doing is dusting with the swiffer pad. I am very disappointed with this product. I would not recommend it."
3,Not meant for one time use over multiple rooms!,"The vac works very well at picking up dog hair, dust, and very small items. However, the battery does not last very long at all. It barely survives cleaning my living room and dining room and takes 18 hours to charge back up. I also occasionally have trouble with the swiffer pad moving which causes the unit to scratch along the floor."
5,Handy little device.,"I purchased this item because of the limits that a broom and dust pan have. You can sweep and sweep and sweep the dust into the dustpan but there is always a residual amount of dust left on the floor. The Swiffer Sweeper Vac changes all that and saves me a step or two when cleaning the kitchen floor. Just don't expect it to have the same vacuuming power as a conventional vacuum cleaner. This was meant for lightweight stuff like cereal. Candies and popcorn kernals, it won't pick up, otherwise enjoy the ease provided by the Swiffer company's fine products."
5,best ever,I thinks this product is wonderful. Lots of hardwood floors. I live on the water and find my floors are dusty and sandy. No more spreading the dust around. IT PICKS IT UP. I didn't expect it to work like a powerful vacuum.For that price you don;t get a vacuum cleaner. But it really does pick up all small particles and lot of dust. Love it and would recommend it highly.
1,Won't Last,"Same problem as others, this works great for about 3 months, and then you gradually lose the charge capability. I let the battery completely discharge to prevent the memory problems with rechargeable batteries. This did not help, so it must be a product problem. Maybe I got a bad unit, if not, swifter should, if they haven't already, recall and provide a replacement. Unless they have fixed this problem, don't waste your money."
1,Product OK but BATTERIES make it worthless!,This thing does not hold charge even after charging initially for 24 hours... Need $$$ returned!! Just very disappointing that it stopped after doing one room!
4,Good but not great,"The pkging and arrival was as promised. Swiffer vac is a good substitute for a broom n dustpan. Less noisier (not quieter) than a vaccum cleaner (the $40 ones). The refill cloths are worth buying in wholesale stores. The filter, as suggested by a neighbour I vaccum it with the big vac for a nicer clean after dumping the contents. I live in a 1br hard wood floored apt and it gets my job done. However I have to be real quick, as the battery shuts off in about 20 minutes. It takes 18 hours everytime(not just the first time) to get it charged for a full use. I keep it plugged in 24 hrs in my kitchen, that way it is ready when Ive a mess. They couldve created a better battery or a better life for the battery. That is why its good but not great !"
2,Not Enough Power for Our Needs,"I bought this vaccum with high expectations, as my wife uses it at the retail store she manages, and likes how it works there. For our home, however, it was a little bit underpowered. We have three large dogs and two cats. The vaccum picked up animal hair and dust well enough, but it was not strong enough to pick up kitty litter or pieces of dirt any bigger than a couple of millimeters in diameter from our laminate floors. Besides that, the vaccum charges quickly enough and has enough battery to clean several rooms. The suction is just not good enough to make our broom obsolete, so we don't use the vaccum any more."
1,Piece of crap,Don't try hard with this one. Poor life battery. Too much to trade for a chordless vacuumn. I have it charged overnight and all I can use is 2 mins.
1,swiffer vac a ripoff,doesn't pick up anything heavier than a dustball...just buy a swiffer dry duster...will save you money.
4,"swiffer good, vacuum ok","the swiffer and pads work really well, but the vacuum just works ok. it picks up dust bunnies well, but has trouble with heavier items like kitty litter that my dustbuster would pick up in a heartbeat"
3,"Better than a broom, but not as good as I'd hoped","I'd like to give 3 and a half stars, but since I don't have the option, I put 3. This product isn't bad - it is a good way to give a quick touch up on our tile floors. It's definitely less work than a broom, but is not quite as effective as I had hoped. We have a fairly large tiled area, and with 3 people (including 1 teenager) and 3 cats, there's a lot of dust, hair and crumbs on the floor. The sweeper did okay with the dust and hair, but the vacuum is only so-so on what it picks up. It would not pick up kitty kibble crumbs, for instance. A whole piece of cereal will not get vacuumed up, while a crushed piece of cereal probably will. The key to this product is to use it often - if the floor gets too dirty, it's too much for this product to handle. But for quick every day maintenance, it beats getting out the broom for sure."
4,Cleans well but dies before finished with house,I am not sure if i messed up the battery on mine or not. When I took it out of the box i turned it on. then read the directions which say DO NOT TURN ON UNTIL YOU LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN FOR 24 HOURS. My Swiffer vac works great but dies before i am finished cleaning all the floors in the house my friends tell me that theres does not die. But i have alot of floor to clean also. SO DONT USE IT UNTIL YOU CHARGE IT and you will probably be fine
2,Worked great until it died...,"I thought at first this product was the answer to my kitchen floor issues. It picked up all kinds of stuff for a few months. Then, it just didn't want to work anymore. It is like the motor just decided it was done and I had gotten my money's worth out of it. I now own a small upright vacuum with optional rotating brush. (red hoover) This is the answer instead of letting a cheap knock off attempt to do the work."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this product for 27 dollars at the walmart in town. I got it home, charged it for 18 hours. The product only ran on its first full charge for around 20 minutes..I really don't know how these people can get away with their products pkg description as it is entirely 'false advertisment'.This product DOES NOT pick up kitty litter, It DOES NOT pick up cereal as the brightly colored picture on the box shows that it does. In fact it barely picks up small sand and dirt. I was entirely disappointed in the product and its advertising..I do however own the swiffer mop and I love that product."
1,Terrible battery life,"When I first purchased this product, I wasn't thrilled with the suction of the vacuum, but it wasn't bad. I still used it for a quick clean up. I've had it about two years now and the battery/life power only lasts for one room. I can't even clean my whole kitchen without it powering down. Very disappointing."
4,Great product,"This is a very convenient cleaning tool, really like it onmy wood floors. I think it is worth the money. Shouldget the extra starter kit."
2,Lamp problems,"Just brought this tv and only had it for a month and the lamp blew out! Called Toshiba customer service and ask them if this happens alot with this tv. Customer Service stated that it may have been a bad batch. Just be warned, you may want to get the warranty. Also, they stated it would take 3 to 10 days to get the lamp. Expensive lesson!"
1,Poor Design,In my opinion the design is poor for the 52HM95 I have. The $200-300 light bulb blew after only 100-200 hours of use. The warranty replacement blew after only 50-100 hours of use. Other than the potential cost of ownership being several thousands of dollars per yer in bulbs it seems good.
3,NOT the original Yearling with Gregory Peck,"Prospective buyers please note, the version of The Yearling included on this disc is not the 1947 film starring Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman - it's the 1994 made for tv remake starring Peter Strauss, Jean Smart, and Philip Seymour-Hoffman."
3,Make sure you buy both books,"I actually picked this book up at used bookstore having no idea it was the second in the series. It can stand alone, but you really do need the first book to get the full impact of the second. This book was a bit slow to start (or maybe it just took me that long to catch up), but the last 100 pages is where the story got really good. SPOILER COMING: The idea that there were triplets was a tiny bit baffling (maybe even a bit unbelievable) but she made it work. Overall it was a fun book - though I really feel no need to read the first book now. I think it would have been better, and I would have likely given it a higer rating had I read both books consecutively."
5,THE BEST DAMN COMPILATION OF THE YEAR,"IF I COULD GIVE THIS ALBUM A RATING HIGHER THAN 5 I WOULD. THE BEATS ARE POUNDIN, THE LYRICS ARE FRESH AND NEW, NOT RECYCLED LIKE ON OTHER COMPILATIONS, WHERE YOU HAVE ALLSTAR NAMES BUT NO ALLSTAR TRACKS. AND THE TRACKS YOU DO GET HAVE STARRED ALL OVER. THIS COMP IS HOT. GO GET IT FOR REAL...IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT ALREADY."
5,coconut oil review,"I didn't find this item very helpful for my hair. I do love using it for dry skin. It's the best product I ever used for my hands and feet. It can be a little messy. I rub it on my skin and then wipe the palms of my hands or my feet with a paper towel and I find it's much better than any lotion I've tried through the years. It doesn't have much of a scent. A little goes a long way and even though I use it several times a day I still have plenty of it. I would buy this again and again. It seems to cost more than lotion but considering how you don't need much of it, even if you wipe off the excess, you really don't use that much. I highly recommend it."
2,HP!!,"We had an old HP before and I wasn't interested in buying another one for bad results with the old one; we bought the DeskJet 932C and right now... I am printing the 22nd page of ""nothing"" than letters and numbers of all kind, just because a sheet got stock. It's doing this every time we get a page that get stock. 2* for the quality of the pictures."
1,The coffee man,You will love this machine but just wait. A few months after the warranty expired the gears on the inside gave out. We were very diligent about keeping the machine clean and descaling. If you look on the authorized service centers for Washington DC you can choose the Carolinas or NY. So we paid the $600 to fix it in NY thinking would make it for years to come; I mean our dyson vacuum has lasted 10 years without repair. Now a year after that repair the diagnostic software shows a general fault; no more coffee for us.DeLonghi is no help!DO NOT BUY ANY APPLIANCES FROM THIS COMPANY!
3,Good tasting coffee but inconsistent,"Great tasting coffee still had to return it b/c:1) The temperature wasn't consistent and most of the time wasn't hot enough after you added cream.2) It also wasn't strong enough - my husband likes Peet's (to give you an idea) and there wasn't enough caffeine in each cup to give him the caffeine jolt.3) You couldn't really make a regular sized 8-10oz. coffee. We had to hit the ""large"" setting twice to double the dose.Overall, expected more for the cost. We're purchasing a Gaggia Platinum to give it a try. Our friend has one and the coffee she made for me was burning hot and super strong. It was made coffee faster than the DeLonghi."
1,Avoid,Huge problem with this tail light.There are zero promotional information that suggests this product requires their own saddle to be used.
1,By a good book,"If you want to learn something about access 2000, don't by this book. It does not work very sistimaticly. It never goes in any depth. Maybe you can consider bying the book if you have to work with Access, not if you have to make database. I bought another more complete and expensive book. I should have done that in the first place."
5,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman","What a great show, watched it as a kid. I still love it as an adult and would love to be able to get volume 2 sometime."
3,They messed up,I love this show and am glad i bought it but there is a really messed up episode included on this set. Episode 23 opens with a scene that obviously had been introduced on a previous episode but was never shown. Loretta and Charlie get stopped by Hillbillies but when the show opens it is already in the middle of it. Then they cut to a scene that was already shown on the previous episode. It makes no sense. I have read that in syndication it was cut out because of being too graphic so be warned that we are not getting all of the original material. I also would have liked a few special features like commentary or interviews. Still worth buying.
5,"""I had a coupon for tomato paste, but they were out, so.....""","So Mary got VD instead! hahahahahahahaA great American institution! No one else on TV before or since has skewered so many tabooissues as Mary Hartman, and no other show before or since can claim such an all-round all-starcast as this show....we were even intro'd to Martin Mull and Dabney Coleman through this show astotal lowlifes that we loved to hate. And hey, Doris Roberts from Who Loves Raymond fame evenspent a few years with this fine cast.Hard to believe its been 30 years since this show debuted. Fans finally have a proper DVD treatmentso that we can relive the brilliance of this groundbreaking and much maligned series. 5 Pigtails"
1,Scams for the Greedy,"Well, Glassman and Hassett wrote in 1999 that the market was undervalued. They might still believe that today, but I'd wager they will not be following this book up with ""Dow 10,000 Again!"" Speaking of wagering, most small investors would probably be better off if they took their investment dollars to the racetrack. Even a Pick 3 ticket has a better chance of paying off than the stocks these truly motley fools promote. We have learned the hard way that the louder someone shouts to invest, the more likely it is that they've already sold their own shares and are making money the new-fangled way -- cheating the little guy."
1,Totally WRONG,"Wow, they still sell this book? It's 2008 and the Dow is below 12,000.Maybe the title didn't mean that the Dow would reach 36,000.It meant that there are 36,000 false predictions in the book!On a serious note, I feel very sad for those who followed the advice of this book."
2,Disco rears its' ugly head>>>>,"Bedazzled by the flashy artwork on the cover, a well meaning friend bought this album for me. After the first song, I thought there would be more intricate musical creation. To my disatisfaction, more of the same exercise/hip-hop/disco stuff.If you have ever wondered what disco and electronic music sound like together, this is for you.This is just too dull for a full listen, all the way through.If you love that bygone era of disco music, you will probably love this album. For those of you seeking more intricate listening, forget it."
3,Order Larger Size,Ordered Size Medium. (Size I normally wear.) Gloves were to small. Had to wet them & work them in to fit.... Recommend ordering a larger size then you need.
3,I almost didn't read this - but then did - and enjoyed it,"This was a cute book - once I let myself relax and enjoy it. I had a problem with the characters in the beginning. I am the same age as the characters in the book and have some friends that fit neatly into the profiles of the character. My problem was I hated the whole SWINGERS epidemic that hit the club scene a few years back ""your so money"" etc... No matter how hot Ben Estes was in reality the moment he said ""baby"" and ""pallie"" etc. I would have run for the hills. And Sophia was a bit annoying too. They reminded me of the too pretty couple that really have nothing to go on but their good looks. After all that is said. I did enjoy the book. I found some of it funny and think Kylie Adams has a fun writing style. very now."
3,Decent sound after an extensive burn in,"These were way, way, way too bright sounding intially, but got a lot better after a long burn in time. The bass is a little lacking for my tastes and the midrange is way flat to me, but this may be subjective depending on your musical tastes and personal preferences.They seem rather durable, and for me they're quite comfortable. Moreso than my Koss KCS-75s. I like the fit and durability so much I'm actively wondering if I can Frankenstein the Koss drivers into this frame."
5,"Project Pat puts his own life style in rap, the real deal","Project Pat is one of the best rappers out there, no questions asked. I give him all the credit he deserves for singing about the real deal. He's talking about his life and puts it in music, his songs are stories. ... He doesn't hold anything back and comes up with some [great] rymes. I cant dis him in any way because all of his songs are genuis. Some songs that I think are great are: ""Mouth write a check"", ""Throw your set"" feat. Crucial Conflict, ""Weak Niggaz"", ""Posse song"", and ""still ridin clean"""
5,Too true for you!,"I ABSOLUTELY loved this book!My fav tale was ""Cruelties"".What woman has not lived this story in both heart and soul (and suspicions)?Ms. Wilson has a great imagination for the bizarre and the surreal.If you buy this book (and I think you should), read it on a night that you feel bored. This book will surely fix that problem."
4,New and yet familiar,I really enjoyed the stories presented in Season 1 of Paranormal Witness. It is really just about as much as you'd expect from one of these docu-drama type paranormal stories programs. The format and directing methods haven't really changed since the genre came out in the early 90's (or late 80's?)
1,trash,I purchased this a long time ago and kept bringing it out every so often to try to figure out why it wouldn't work! After reading the reviews I am furious that thing has such a stupid 'safety feature'! If you don't know how to use a knife you wouldn't have purchased this thing to begin with! Everything that you want to slice HAS TO fit into the small oval opening! Cannot believe this was even invented but really can't believe I paid so much money for it :(
1,awkward to use,I had owned an older model of this mandoline which was much easier to use. I;m rather unhappy with this one.
1,Too hard to use,"I had the original Pampered Chef Mandoline and liked it, but thought I should upgrade as I use it at least 3 times each week.I found it hard to work with and the blade did not seem to be sharpe enough."
1,broke within 6 months.,rubbish product and customer service.i bought the squre stoneware dish and it cracked within 6 months. Pampered chef want me to pay for the delivery back to them which will cost half the price of the product. what ever happened to customer satisfaction.
1,"Run from this book, as fast as you can","I cannot believe how bad this book was - it seems like it was written by committee. Think ""It Takes a Thief"" meets ""Charlie's Angels"" meets ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""You've got your emotionally wounded heroine chased by a psycho rapist and murderer, your crippled hero that ends up committing murder in an act of revenge. You've got your magic stones and Voodun priests, you've got your time travel. You've got faked murder, jewel thieves, and spies. Plus, sexy locations like Tahiti and Rio. All in about 300+ pages of bad dialogue.Don't waste your money, don't waste your eyesight."
2,Didn't fit,Had to return these mud flaps. They did not fit my Toyota Tacoma although it said they would. The return was easy so I was not really inconvenienced by the whole thing.
2,Not so impressed,"I have been a fan of Alex's since 105 degrees, and I was not too impressed with as promised. O.K. to listen to but I don't believe Alex was up to his standard on this one."
4,A previously unknown sound from Japan,"I have heard a fair amount of Japanese mainstream popular music, and I believe I can say with some confidence that this particular group stands out from the typical band. The overall sound is strongly reminiscent of American grunge bands, such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam; but the mood of the music is more cheerful. The band's stripped-down arrangements focus strongly on the raw elecric sound of guitar and base, with powerful and straightforward drum lines. Much use is made of feedback and other techniques which blur the tone, but no song breaks down entirely into discord and the overall effect is more melodic than one hears from similar US bands. Those put off by the raw electric fury of American grunge should find something here to their liking. In sum, this CD feels like a reflection of US alternative from about five years back; new to Japan, and an interesting twist on an old style to America."
2,YOU HAVE TO BE A TRU FANTO LIKE THIS!,DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE KIDS!!!! YO' THIS AINT EVEN REAL HIP HOP. STEER CLEAR OF THIS HAZARD!!!!!!
5,"As Always, Brilliant","I absolutely love this CD, as I do all of his others. I bought it the day it came into stores and haven't taken it out of my CD players yet! Every song on it has a message that speaks volumes. I love everything about the music from the lyrics to the composition and orchestration.If I had to pick a favorite song (which is always hard because I love them all) I would say ""Walking her Home."" It is a beautiful story of true, pure, lasting love from it's beginning into eternity. Bring tears to my eyes every time.It's hard to deny afer hearing ALL of his music (not just this CD), that God is working through him and his music. After putting out this much music, all of which is absolutely wonderful, it's clear to me how gifted he is. I could be here for hours explaining the beauty of every song on the CD. Go get it and see for yourself!!"
4,Fantastico,Buena grabación y buena orquesta para disfrutar a fondo del compositor.Disco en buen estado y envío muy rápido.Muy recomendable. Volveré a comprar otra vez..
2,One Chapter on H.264 Only - Don't Bother,"I got this book since it is the only book on H.264 I know of.There is a single chapter on H.264, chapter 6. The freeon-line papers from Richardson are mostly what is in that chapter.There are plenty of H.264 overviews on the net for freewhich cover the subject in greater depth which are more current."
5,As Time Goes By - Series 6,As Time Goes By is a great British comedy. Dame Judi Dench and Geoffrey Palmer are so good together - their chemistry shows through. The supporting cast members are all just great. I lived in England and loved this series over there. I am glad I sought out the dvd's for this series. You cannot go wrong with Dame Judi Dench!
5,Sound intervention ideas,"As a professional in the field of applied behavior analysis and autism, I often do not agree with interventions recommended by occupational therapists (the author is an OT) that target inappropriate sensory behaviors displayed by individuals with an autism spectrum disoder. However, this book makes a point of recommending age-appropriate interventions, as well as ways to teach individuals with an ASD to monitor their own sensory-seeking behaviors. The book is full of case examples and practical intervtions. It is short and easy to read, which makes it a valuable resource for parents and teachers. One caution - this book DOES NOT USE PEOPLE-FIRST LANGAUGE! If you can get past that fault, then it's a great resource."
5,Fantastic sound,"If you want clear clean sound -- these deliver a great value. However, you should know that they do not cover your ear completely and they are a tad tight. I thought I'd use them as a noise cancelling set on a long trip to Hawaii -- they don't have noise cancelling capability -- but I was hoping that if they completely enclosed my ears that may work -- it didn't. Nonetheless, these are excellent if used for only a few hours at a time."
5,a very good value,I use a treadmill an hour a day and bought an mp3 player to help pass the time. I found myself not liking the sound I was hearing from the supplied headphones. I wasnt sure that on ear headphones would be comfortable but I do not care for the in ear type. After doing some research and listening I bought the akg's. They sound very good on a wide variety of music and are comfortable for long term use as well. They sound much better then the in ear types and kill almost all ambient noise. In my opinion they are the best sounding headphones anywhere near their price.
5,Fantastic quality at a great price,"Best headphones I have ever owned. I never realized I could own this type of sound quality without having to shell out Bose-like prices.I did a fair amount of research and these seem to be know as some of the best bang for your buck amongst the audio geeks, something I can attest to once I swapped out those terrible iPod buds with these beauties.Very happy, highly recommended."
2,Cheaply Made,"These headphones were really great. Much more affordable than noise cancelling headphones, I used these on near weekly flights for roughly eighteen months and they completely drowned out the noise of the plane, snoring passengers, and bawling children without destroying my ear drums.Unfortunately they recently broke early in a three hour and half hour flight back home. As I was removing them the left earphone popped off the casing which hit the guy sitting next to me and woke him up. I spent the rest of the flight holding the earphone up to my ear, which was a pile of suck. When we landed, the casing was nowhere in sight and I was too tired to go searching under the seats for it.I got $50 worth out of them, but I'm hoping I'll be able to send them back under warranty."
2,OK,"An OK calculator for the price. But as a previous reviewer noted,the display can be viewed only at low angles. I've used a lot of calculators,but none like this!!"
1,Does not work,"I brought over the summer for Fall math class did not need to use until September. Did not look broken in package, but calculator does not work LED cutting off numbers or incomplete numbers. Too late to return.Sharp EL-506VB DAL Series Twin-Powered Scientific Calculator"
3,Low battery,The battery in this item lasted about one (1) week after I received it. At first I thought it was because I was in the house why the numbers was disjointed but a few days later it went blank. To present I have not used it again.
1,Does Harlequin Romance have a lesbian branch?,"If so, that's where this belongs. I was sorely disappointed by this sad excuse for a novel. It's poorly written, poorly conceptualized, and a waste of money. If you're looking for a good May/December romance story, try Jennifer Fulton's ""Greener Than Grass."""
2,Don't expect much from the b-sides.,"""There There"" is a very good song. However, since it's also on Radiohead's latest album, Hail To The Thief, there's absolutely no reason to buy this single unless you're a completist like myself.""Paperbag Writer"" (is that title supposed to be a joke?) is a typical Radiohead b-side (a lot like the stuff they put on their albums except not as grandiose), though quite a bit below par compared to the b-sides from Amnesiac's singles. ""Where Bluebirds Fly"" begins, ends, and runs throughout with THE most irritating percussion loop I've ever heard. The echoey, ghostly vocals have also become a bit much by this point. It's obvious that they didn't put a lot of effort into these songs, and that worries me since this is the lead-off single for the album. Hopefully, future singles' b-sides will be a lot better, but I'm not holding my breath."
4,TREASURED TUNES 4,"Although I found it a bit pricey, I bought this CD, mainlyfor one song, DIANE, by the Batchelors. Although I also enjoysome of the other songs on the album, I was very surprised byhow much I enjoyed #10, I DON'T CARE, by Helen Shapiro. I wentto CDNOW biography and learned more about her, and was fascinatedby her story. I cannot find this song anywhere else."
5,"Awesome bock, inspiring history","Up to today we had one barely idea as is the life from one Delta Force, though with this book, you can see there is a lot more, and that they really work hard. The narrative is very good too. If you already have watched The Unit, then this book is a must, specially because there is a lot in common between both. It~s the sort of book that once you start you don't want to stop."
5,Inside Delta Force,"Out of the books I've read written by former Delta Force Operators and ST6, Haney's goes into the most detail about their training. This book was a page turner for me. It doesn't slow down anywhere throughout the book. Their are some great stories that I don't want to give away in detail with a review that were eye openers for me. I highly recommend this book if you're interested in how Delta Force first started with some of the training they did back then. I would recommend this book to friends and family."
5,Top Stuff,"Excellent book, very well written. Has humour in it that even Australian's can get. Gives a very good look inside the unit, and some very humorous depictions of the late warrior Charlie A Beckwith."
5,Amazing book and series!,The DVD series is amazing and to get a chance to read the actual book is amazing. Well written and amazing. A real life 24 experience.
3,Lots of details for so many years later.,"I just finished the book. It started slow, really slow... basically just talking about how awesome he is in his own eyes. Gets a little better as it goes on, but there are so many details of so many conversations he had that many years ago, it's a little hard to believe. The ending left me wanting more."
5,"Amazing Book, I Want More!","This is an amazing book for a guy like me, who hides behind a screen monitor all day long and never get out in the sun, because it makes me thankful for all the men out there doing their service.Can anyone tell me what the best book to read for the SAS would be? I'd like to read something with the same feel of honesty and accuracy as this book, but dealing with the SAS. I've heard that all the Navy SEALs book out there kinda sux, so I'd like to read up on the SAS instead. Or if you know of a great SEALs book, then please let me know. Response here in the review would be great."
3,A Bit Exagerated,"While this book offers some interesting stories about Eric Hainey's experiences in Delta, one must wonder why he is the only Delta member to write a book about Delta. I am close friends with two founding members who knew and worked with Hainey, and according to their accounts, some of the stories were a bit exagerated. Furthermore, many of Hainey's compatriots have eschewed repeated book offers based strictly on principal - regardless of the huge sums of money being offered them. They did not do it for the money then, nor would they tell about it for money now. So what's different about Hainey from his peers?For someone who does not know much about Special Ops, this book is an interesting read. Otherwise, the only thing that kept me in it was a few of his stories, albeit dressed up as they may be."
3,Pat Rocks,A nice trip back to the eighties Brings back memories of my youth spent in Montreal. Not an album that you will listen to often but is worth having in your collection 3 1/2*
5,Actually...,"Crimson and Clover was Joan Jett. However, this album is in fact missing Treat Me Right and You Better Run.Still, a very good showing for one of the best voices in rock."
2,Doesn't keep time,"This is such a beautiful watch, I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. But unfortunately I had to return it because before the end of the day, it was already off time and would not keep time no matter how many times I set it. I took it to have the battery looked at and they said the watch was fine. So I asked for a replacement from Amazon and the next one I got had a huge gash in the back, looking like someone tried to open the back with a screwdriver and messed up horribly. So it's a beautiful watch, but buyers beware!"
2,Disappointing to say the least,"I was really excited to get this book. But it is a big disappointment. The bookRelics & Rituals Olympus (Sword & Sorcery)is a much better fantasy role-playing guide to the ancient Greek mythos, to be certain. OGL Ancients replicates too much material right out of the d20 SRD (at least half of the pages are of that material) that you probably already have if you own the PHB or have access to the SRD online. The classes are not well thought out. If you play a non-magic or low-magic campaign you may like some of the materials presented in this book. Don't get your sights set too high with this one. If you can pick this one up for under $10 it is not a bad deal. At the very least it has some material in it, that can provide you with a few interesting ideas, and the timeline is a good template. But races, classes, magic, armor & weapons, magic items, skills and feats are all very lacking."
3,Ok piece of equipment,"Mine original one fell off, this one was an alright replacement. There wasn't much elasticity in the one I got."
3,fun but tedious,"no problem with the mold itself, comes out as easily as any other chocolate mold and clean up is easy. these ladybugs are adorable when theyre all painted up but thats where the cons come in. theyre a real pain to paint all the spots and eyes on and some of them stuck to mold when they came out. perhaps its my lack of experience in working with a mold like this."
5,DVD-Audio Content,"The reviewer who writes: ""the music is great, but the DVD is nothing more than a collection of pictures..."" fails to understand the concept of a DVD-Audio disc. Along with that ""collection of pictures"", there is a high resolution 192kHz 24-bit stereo track and a brand new 96kHz surround mix. Each of those alone is worth the price of admission."
3,Should have done a remix,The album is as good as it has ever been with the same Jackson Browne sound that has made him famous. If the original multi-track tape is still avilable a new digital remix would most certainly be an improvement to sonic quality.
5,Astonishingly good,"This was never my favorite JB album. (That would be Late for the Sky). Still, the sound via DVD Audio is so crystal clear and moving that I cannot stop listening to this version. If you are even remotely a fan (and have DVD Audio capability), invest in this one. You will not be disappointed."
4,excellent cd,"This is an excellent cd from CM. I bought it when it first came out and fell in love with it! All the tracks are strong, especially the song ""do you ever think about me"" This is a great CD that was overlooked by too many people."
5,Still tearing up!,"I've just finished listening to ""Ae Fond Kiss"" for the umpteenth time and still felt myself tearing up! The lyrics, melody, and orchestration exemplify the sadness of parting forever. But the tears are mostly brought on by the joy I feel hearing Eddi Reader's passion and command of her material.Her interpretation of the other songs is just as rich (listen to her ""Auld Lang Syne"" and you'll understand it and feel it as never before).Be sure to try her other CDs, as they all are brilliant! Her voice is a delight, her material insightful and lovely."
3,"It's big, but not bad","The truck LOOKS impressive enough, but it has very little power and really only works on carpet or a semi-smooth surface. It slips too much on wood floors and won't move at all in grass. I wasn't expecting a full-fledged off road truck, but I expected it to be a little more powerful given its bulk."
4,Keep reading,"One thing I found about successful people is that they read. So even though you this book is not as good as ""How to master the art of selling"" by Tom Hopkins, it's still a great book with great concepts, not to mention that it's an easy read. So you should definitely add this one to your bookshelf!!"
5,Gitomer- Little Red Book of Selling,I just got a Gitomer`s Little Red Book of Selling and it`s really shocked me. Because the book were shipped in a very short time and the quality is very high. It was first book that i bought from amazon and i was satisfied.
4,good common sense,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its very common sense, but still inspirational. Its easy to forget to do the basics some times. And this book gets you back on track."
4,You become what you think about,"“You become what you think about.” Truer words have never been spoken. But the secret to “The Strangest Secret,” is—It’s a dedicated self-discipline that must be practiced every day. How close to “every day” are you?GITOMER, JEFFREY (2004-09-25). Little Red Book of Selling: 12.5 Principles of Sales Greatness (p. 180). Jeffrey Gitomer. Kindle Edition."
1,Written for those who have attention deficits?,I sent this book back. It is written in bullet points and different types of fonts and in bold. It seemed to be yelling out car salesmen pitches. Good for those with attention deficits?
5,Something new every time,"I've had a copy of this book for awhile and purchased another copy for a friend. Every time I pick up this book, something new pops out. This is absolutely the most complete book on alchemy and mysticism- the selection of color images is amazing, filling up just about every page with a description on the side. This thick book is worth it!"
4,Knife,"This is a replacement for my old 45 year old 6"" 1/2 knife I used for everything, hunting & fishing. It's 420HC Stainless Steel Blade makes it worth the high price, the blade will outlive me.I don't exactley collect knives, but appreciate good steel because I depend on them when needed. This knife will defintely be used a lot. The only down nit picky thing for me is it's not well balanced, the handle is much heavier than I would typically like for the blade end size and weight."
2,Seems I should have waited 5 years,"I bought my copy of BS&T Greatest Hits in 1994, but from the reviews I see here I should have waited until 1999 when they re-released it with 2 more tracks & apparently the single versions of the hits. Back in '94 I was disappointed the LP versions of songs,especially ""Spinning Wheel"" were included,even though the back cover lists this song as being 2:39,thus the single version with the guitar solo instead of piano solo in the middle I was seeking. (I already have the first 2 LPs,so I already have the LP version). Around the same time in '94 I also bought Elvis Presley Gold Records Vol.3 only to see it re-released several years later with more hits that should have been included in the first place. Seems record companies waited until the late 90's to do their reissues right. I bet the late 90's version of BS&T Greatest Hits sounds alot better,too, but if I bought the new improved version, what would I do with the old one???"
1,A reasonably intelligent human,"Is there a rating lower than 1 star? This monitor had an attractive price.... and that's about all. After 2 years, this object no longer works and Sylvania is of no help. It costs more to fix it, than to buy a new monitor -- another brand, please!"
1,Not Worth the Money,"I also bought this monitor because of the attractive price.The monitor no longer works after only 1.5 years of use. Completely dead. Sylvania no longer wanted anything to do with it because it was out of its 1 year warranty. I was willing to pay for servicing, but the most their tech support could offer was ""find a local guy to fix it.""Flat panels are expected to last twice as long as CRTs, not half as long and certainly not only 1.5 years. My advice is to buy a flat panel with a 3 year warranty, stay away from the 1 year warranties and stay away from Sylvania.Certainly not worth the money."
5,Answer the call,You have not lived until you have had Death or Glory blasting high volume while you speed down a highway. An incredible album that sound as fresh in 06 as it did in 79. A timeless classic that everyone should own.
4,Genre busting gem,"I'm not so in touch with the history of the Clash as some of the reviewers nor am I into debating how best to pigeon-hole them, I just love this record! So many great songs, so many styles, how can one not enjoy at least some of these songs?The title track and it's follow-up Brand New Cadillac are a one-two punch that any band would love to have laid down. The songs bounce onward with amazing smoothness despite the stylistic differences of Hateful, Jimmy Jazz, the aforementioned two, Lost in the Supermarket, et al. One could talk about what it means to be punk but I always thought it was more an aesthetic issue opposed to some instrumental or songwriting shortcomings. Give me this over the ridiculous Sex Pistols any day."
2,Good But...,"Five simply stunning songs (London Calling, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful and The Guns of Brixton) and one good one (Koka Kola) and the rest you can keep. Not the defining punk rock moment we are lead to believe but maybe if it was a single album (it was a double vinyl release) it could have been a worthy classic. The cover, however, is a classic from the Elvis reference to the pure rock and roll pose. Shame about the music."
2,Is it really THAT good?,"I've heard my share of punk rock albums, and I'm definitely skeptical that this one actually lives up to the hype, even though I've never heard any of it. Haven't you people ever heard of Green Day and Nirvana? What about Blink-182? Shan't they count for something? Let's get into the modern age, folks.I just remember this band's dumb song from 1982 or something, ""Rock the Casbod."" Man, that song was annoying!! So was the dusky video!! What did any of it mean?No disrespect to the Clash, for I know they are highly revered, but I feel the Meat Puppets and Journey were much better.Hope this helps..."
5,Goodbye Joe,"I just can't say enough about London Calling. I still remember ripping the shrink wrap off the LP back in the cold winter of 1980 anticipating yet another great Clash album. Then I was shocked. It was even better than my lofty expectations. I played it until the grooves were worn. ... I had never seen a band play with so much passion. ... Upon hearing of the tragically early death of singer guitarist Joe Strummer, I pulled the CD out for a spin. Twenty two years have done nothing to dull the luster of this monumental work. From the ominous opening strains of London Calling to the pub-skank of Rudie Can't Fail, to the final fade of Train in Vain I was reminded of the sounds of a great band hitting their stride, filled with passion, humor and conviction. This remains one of my all time favorites. Rest in Peace Joe."
5,Powerful and Anointed!!,"What a blessing this music has been for my family, and my church family! When our praise and worship team lead us in these songs, they are so edifying - right to the heart and the spirit!! God bless you, Tommy!!"
5,Never Gonna Stop,"This CD is fantastic. I must admit I was in the choir and we performed it 3 times in church with a congragation. We rocked the house. So I heard it live three times. The CD is almost as good as live. Great sound and mixing. I recommend other Tommy Walker CD's, like Acoustic, Live, etc. Enjoy!!!!"
4,This Album Is Not A Farce,"Recently I read a review of Natural Bridge (not on this page) which simply referred to this record as a farce. This is completely wholeheartedly and unequivocably untrue. I recently looked up the word ""farce"" in the dictionary and it read: ""The surface of the front of the head from the top of the forehead to the base of the chin and from ear to ear."" I can tell you, this album is, if anything, the opposite of this and I don't honestly think this reviewer knew what he was talking about. If I were to give a definition it would be that this is an album which is a light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect. I am a genius."
4,3 tier platter set,"Great value and beautiful platter set. I used it to display cupcakes at a baby shower and was very pleased with it. The only difficulty I had with it was in shipping. When I received it, it was broken, I emailed customer service and they promptly sent me a new one."
4,Pleased....,"For the money, this item is a great value. Mine arrived damaged due to poor packaging on Anchor Hockings part and Amazon is sending a replacement immediately. I entertain a lot and this platter set will get a lot of use!"
1,Arrived smashed so can't tell if it's nice or not!!!!!,"I was looking forward to this platter, it arrived today and the UPS man said it sounds broken. I said I had read here where many customers said theirs had arrived smashed. Well it looks and sounds like mine is too. I was hoping to be lucky. It is a gift and I am very disappointed. Refused delivery upon driver's suggestion. My question, do I try again? I bet it was nice if it would be in one piece not hundreds!! Styrofoam ( I know environmentally unfit) formed around shaped item like when you buy something in a box in the store should solve the problem, not just cardboard. It's glass!!!! Oh well."
1,SOOO BROKEN !!,Im very sad and upsep! This tiers platter set was suposed to be the cake holder of my weeding cake.. but... guess what.? I recieved them broken for poor packing... Amazon must to ask to the glass stores to be more carefully with the products of they sold.
5,Indictment and Memorial for the horrors of the genocide,"The books serves as an indictment against those who committed the atrocities during the Rwanda genocide, against those that stood by(most everyone), and those that stood in the way(the French).It also serves as a silent memorial for those who died and for all the other innocents caught in the middle and forced into refugee camps.A highly recommended accompaniment to ""I wished to inform you that we will be killed tomorrow"".This books stands with ""The House of Bondage"" by Cole, an indictment of Apartheid, and ""Amin's Bloody Rule"", an obvious indictment of Idi Amin, as the best photo documentaries of the hardest of times in Africa. (Amin's Bloody Rule is impossible to find, published in Uganda)."
3,standard,not that good. won't spend the money for this product again.It arrived looking like it was purchased and taped up.packaging was sloppy and torn
3,OK Graphics - Terrible Immersion,"Gettting this product as a gift I was really looking forward to playing it after playing the Original Quake Games.This one is nothing like those. The graphics are OK at times, but the game never fully convinces you that you are playing anything but a game. It does not immerse you into the action like other games like Crysis and Call of Duty 4, both of which I recommend Highly!The Voice Overs are very annoying! and the sounds are very ""Tinny""! When you hop on one of the bikes, it sounds like a 1/2 horsepower moped! Nothing like an army vehicle should sound like.I'm not sure, but maybe I have outgrown this type of game now? It has been a bit on the ""kiddy"" side of things.Like I said above, if you are over 17, I would skip this one and get Call of Duty 4 or Crysis, both of which are far superior!"
4,"Well done, Les!","What an entertaining read! Les McKeown has been through a lot and shares it all in this book, which is at once hilarious, tragic, and eye-opening. He gives the inside scoop on his life as the frontman of the hysteria-inducing Bay City Rollers and beyond. Les shares the whole story with us - from his upbringing in Edinburgh, to his first forays into music, to teen idolatry in the Rollers, to the aftermath. His sense of humor remains intact and his take on life and his experiences is refreshing. He pulls no punches and seems like a pretty cool guy. Thanks for telling your story, Les!"
3,Soupy Sales black and white DVD,"I have been a Soupy fan since I was a kid in the 50s. I had always wanted some videos of his show(s).I am happy with the videos. I realize that they are not exactly HD quality, but in the 50's we got what was available for the times."
3,There are so many better Carly Simon albums,"There are two fundamental problems with this album. First, producer Arif Mardin seems to have been in a bombastic mood and nearly every song is over-produced. Vengeance, which features one of Carly's best ever rock vocals, is wildly overdone. Did it really need both an electric guitar solo and a disco-horn solo? And umpteen choruses? Did Memorial Day have to be eight minutes long and have a drum solo? Second, Carly just didn't have enough good songs. Some of the songs from SPY are among her all time greats (We're So Close, Never Been Gone) and others are good too (Just Like You Do, Spy) but some should have been discarded. Overall, I would say that this album is a must for the most loyal fans, and a miss for just about everyone else."
3,Bad image quality!!!,"Sorry... image quality is poor, sound is o.k, But, when i purchased this item, was supossed to be volume 5, no volume 3 (as i received)!!!!"
1,What modern genetics says,"This book is misleading.According to Cavalli-Sforza's research, the genetic distance between Anglo-Saxons and the Irish is less than 1. They are extremely closely related. Both northern Celtic and Germanic tribes had been closely related for a very long time. Contrast this relatedness, for example, to people who are not related. The genetic distance separating the English from the Japanese is 59. The genetic distance of the English from Sub-Saharan blacks is 109.I think you get the picture."
5,A real winner of a series!,"The first of a 4 book series leading to MCSA/MCSE certification, this is the best training guide I have ever seen. I have taken the Microsoft recommended course, 2274, as well as read several other books and training guides. I am a MCP, using several resources to reach MCDST certification in route to MCSE certification. This book is amazing! The reference section on how the exam is structured is exactly right. The chapters are well laid out, and track the sections of competency Microsoft tests in the 70-290 exam. That makes it very easy to focus your attention on areas where additional study is necessary. The glossary at the end of each section provides additional study opportunities. In addition, the exercises really give a grasp of the materials. Finally, the Fast Facts section at the end of the book is a great exam review tool. This book will stay on my bookshelf long after certification as a tool to help me be a better system administrator."
3,disppointment,"I used this publisher for other tests and did well. I really can't say the same for this book for the 70-290. I have taken the actual test twice and did worse the second time. The second time, the test was 200% harder and longer. Many of the questions were not from any of the material that I read and used. The book says to use their exercises and practice tests but that didn't really help with the second tests at all. I've made a formal complaint to the testing company and to Microsoft but honestly don't think Microsoft cares one way or the other. It's their Certification and they make the rules. Using the FAST FACTS at the end of the book an hour on two before the test will do you absolutely no good at all!!It's really too much money for what you get and there isn't any assurance that the book and disc included will help you. I think that the book publishers should offer the money back if their material doesn't help you pass the real test."
5,Totally Floored!,That's what you'll be when you allow yourself to be enfolded in the embrace of the LIVING GOD!!!!On your face and fillled to over-flowing! Halleluiah!
2,Nice size bag but did not last very long,"Purchased this bag July 2010 to use with an oversize heavy Yoga mat, a Manduka. Plenty of room for the mat but unfortunately the bag is falling apart. Bag is not strong enough for a heavy yoga mat."
2,"A little too big, really","It's actually a little too big, but better too big than too small. However, what it REALLY needs is a good outside pocket, for one's keys, cellphone, etc. The inner pocket is mesh, not smooth; too tiny, with no closure."
1,Far From Judy's Best,"This is my least favorite Judy Collins album, and judging by the lack of reviewers here, one of her least popular or successful. The only high point is the closing standard, ""Where or When"". The rest is inferior to what Judy is capable of and usually delivers. Get ""Judith"" instead, and skip this one. You won't miss it."
4,Excellent time capsule,"Am I the only person to review this so far? Where is everyone??Anyway, this disc is excellent. The tracklist concentrates on their later material, from ""Automatic"" onwards, which happens to be my favourite stuff. Good news for people like me, but I imagine this will put off some people with their heads still stuck in the JAMC's ""Psychocandy"" days. Oh well, a matter of taste I s'pose.Sound quality is fine and the performances are very tight, especially the material from the 1992 show. These guys were pure pop geniuses, and the energy of their live show is impressive. This album is a good complement to their studio work. Here's hoping they release a longer performance from the 1992-era sometime!"
5,"A listening pleasure, couldn't stop listening to it for a week.","Supurb, enthralling vocals and electric guitar with, for lack of a better term, drive and energy. Like the other posters said it has echoes of blues, and of course you can tell the group was influenced by Middle Eastern/North African musical traditions. But, this album isn't like anything I've ever heard before. In particular I would recommend tract 9- Eh massina sintadoben. Great stuff."
3,"A weaker engine, perhaps, but still a powerful follow-through","To say that Candy-O is a lesser creation than the Cars' first album tells us more about the sheer exuberance and inventiveness of the first than of any weakness inherent in this, their follow-up to the greatest classic of New Wave. In songs like Let's Go, It's All I Can Do, Shoo Be Doo, and Candy-O, the Cars continued to invent a genre, all by themselves. That the genre ultimately was taken over by the hype and image-mongering of the music industry doesn't weaken the artistry evident here. Instead, it just speaks loudly about the irony inherent in the U.S. music scene at the end of the 20th Century--i.e., that corporatization would overwhelm the radicalism of musicians who resisted, and who, at least when this album originally was released, wanted so badly to be different."
1,"sub par tracks, conservative dance beats","After the first rather dark instrumental, the next few tracks are of the upbeat, funky house type. ""I Can Cast a Spell"" steals a line from the classic ""I'm Every Woman"", namely ""I can cast a spell...secrets you can tell"", sung over and over to a funky disco beat. My favorite tracks are tracks 5 and 8, moody, dark songs with female vocal. The last three tracks are repetitive, uninteresting songs, and the final track is extremely long, and extremely boring, with a sort of tropical sound. Nothing of club anthem quality on this disc. Time listings:1. 3-2-1 Fire (6:28)2. All I do (5:41)3. I can cast a spell (3:40)4. my feeling (5:23)5. keep on movin (7:59)6. Balmes (6:14)7. erotik (5:15)8. touch me (12:36)9. treaty (6:57)10. African dream (11:34)"
5,God blessed this music,"Wonderful collection of worship music, some meditative, some upbeat, all very meaningful and performed as well as anyone cold perform them. This is a great worship experience. We use this music often at our church. All for Jesus!"
1,Racist Text,"I was shocked that educators are allowed to use this text, since it is blatantly RACIST. The logic of the authors for promoting racism and hatred against ""whites"" appears to be a poor understanding of history, and an unjustifiable excuse, similar to a wild west challenge: you're either with us or you're the enemy. If this is 'multicultural psychology,' no wonder this field has such trouble with credibility."
4,Explain for a bit....,"My first edition of this book has over 500 pages. The ""new"" edition has half this? Is this an edited down version? Or does it have tiny type? What? My rating is for the hardcover edition. Maybe someone can explain it. I might have bought it, but information is scant."
4,"good quality dvd, just like store bought","good product, very high quality, not a bootleg or cheap copy. yah da di ya da bla etc. and so forth as it is ok?"
4,Two Tones of Fun,"At the start of the 1980s Two Tone was the UK's most exciting new musical movement. Bands like Madness, The Selecter, The (English) Beat and The Special AKA, all on the Two Tone label, revived the Jamaican ska beat and created a new rhythmic sound that took youth culture by storm.This is a valuable introduction to the Two Tone beat, but unfortunately anything but complete, although all the classic early hits are here: Gangsters, Madness, On My Radio, Tears Of A Clown, etc. The group Madness is underrepresented as they're the band that ultimately achieved the greatest success.Worst of the omissions in my opinion: The Prince by Madness, Let's Do Rocksteady by The Selecter. There is another incomplete Two Tone compilation titledToo Much Two Tonebut the most complete and thorough isThe Two Tone Compilation: A Checkered Past."
5,The one Punk album you need to own,"This is the one punk album you need to own if you care about any pop/rock music produced in the last 2 decades. The Sex Pistols couldn't hold a candle to these four Londoners who wielded their instruments like weapons and called for revolution.True, the mood doesn't change much on this album. Anger, defiance. From anger at the U.S.A., to anger at the New Wave, to anger at unemployment, to anger at prejudice. One song's even titled ""Hate and War"". Only one weak track here - the cover of ""I Fought the Law"". This is the Clash's brilliant debut and second best album, only because London Calling is the best rock album produced since Pet Sounds.And why is it the best punk album ever? Because it has great hooks, great lyrics, speed, and energy."
4,Clash debut memorable but not Classic,"The most influential bands in the short history of Rock and Roll exploded onto the music scene with their debut album. Alas, I cannot speak of the Clash when writing these words. For the debut album from these modern day legends forshadowed their greatness but alone only has slight nuances from other Punk Rock and British 2Tone albums being released at the time. This is not to say the album is not worth buying for one cannot forget it is stil a Clash album and like every Clash album it is full of songs which pierce your skin and make you feel honest and true. For regular Punk and Ska/Reggae listeners songs like ""Garage Land"" and ""White Man in..."" may show what these bands today are trying to immitate and how much they are messing it up."
1,extremely disappointed,"I ordered this for my dad for Christmas as it is his favorite show and what a great price it was! I ordered it in plenty of time to get here by Christmas they sent me an email that it has shipped and was expected by christmas eve. To my disappointment it did not make it and then today, 19 days later, I get an email stating it was returned because they could not deliver it to my address which by the way is in the same exact order in which I placed 13 other items, all which made it no problem. Reading the other reviews I am kind of glad I did not get it because I do not want two of the same disc I will be ordering him something else."
2,Disappointed,"There were 2 disc ""2""s and no disc 1. Ruined a Chritmas present. Called and got no help. No wonder it was available only on this website."
3,unrealistic,"The suggestions of this little booklet are a trifle unrealistic. Like joint sessions of the Diet and Congress. But, perhaps more importantly, the book ignores the rise of the Chinese economy. It may well be that for the US, it is more important to manage the relationship with China, than that with Japan.Since the book was published, Japan's economy has presumably and finally gone into expansion. Driven in large part by Chinese demand for high end Japanese products. This reason is quite different from the book's proposal for a deepening of the US-Japan relationship."
5,LIFE'S BEEN GOOD,"This song has great guitar. Metal, hard rock guitar. Life's Been Good. Just heard it on the radio, and isn't it excellent? And life's been good so far because of my girl named Tunnel of Love, and my rock band."
1,Limp,"West Side Story with aliens instead of working class whites and Puerto Ricans. The idea of alien refugees living among us covertly comes from Zenna Henderson. Shallow characters, strained plotting, pedestrian writing, little originality, and not an ounce of wit."

2,Nah....,"Is very inconvenient. The top part that is supposed to accept the trash, is not working very well, the bottom part opens up too well for the part that it's supposed to stay closed. I used it for a while, and I figured, it's not as convenient."
3,Its okay,"As a Gaillo Fan what can I say... its from the 70's and nothing special, you can now watch this one on netflix streaming. I wasnt crazy about the story but its a good add to my collection."
1,so slow and boring,it took us about 4 sittings to get through the entire movie. it is very slow and not alot happens until about 3/4 of the way through it. a couple go to a party where a scientist tells them a story about driving people crazy then using them in a ritual. then while the couple is playing tennis with the scientist who told them the story the girl gets pricked by a nail in her tennis racket. all of a sudden the girl starts seeing things. so is the girl really going crazy or are the people driving her crazy is the question...what is real and what is an illusion. this is nothing new in cinema but the way it is done here is very boring and drawn out. the music used to indicate a suspenseful moment was annoying and yea they needed music to indicate it or the viewer wouldn't have know it was suspenseful. the acting was also lackluster. the actors seemed bord with their roles and the main actress appeared wooden throughout most of the movie.
5,Great Deal here!,these are good DVD+R cheap too a they look like their double layers for burning each side works fine with my Burner great product.
3,Slightly off target,"Disclaimer: I am a fan of Hohner's gadgetry.The Hohner ""Extreme Bending"" (XB) Harmonica is expensive for an instrument that only plays one key and one scale (plus bends). Commendable as a piece of technology, the notes, all of the notes, bend like blades of grass. It's just the weight; the thick and light construction, the size, it all seems awkward. And the presentation-- a flimsy plastic case, the plates were loose (a screw had fallen out), it wasn't impressive. The sound is ordinary, playability requires some effort, yet the notes are extremely agile. There's something to explore on this harmonica, but it's not balanced."
5,It's the [Spanish] BOMB[s],"This record brings back happy travel memories. Visited London (multi-times) & Andalucia (Grenada, Sevilla, Gibraltar). They're fantastic and so is London Calling. Plus it's simply BPE (best punk ever)."
4,Proof positive of Lagwagon pimpage!,"What a great career restrospective...oh wait, it's all b-sides, rarities and compilation tracks! Folks, that's how good our boys in Lagwagon really are. This album spans Lagwagon's career without any album tracks, truly re-mining many of their gems from over the years into a neat little package. A must for any Lagwagon fan, that's for sure. This album gets 4 stars for its brilliance, but of course there are the obligitory early early early Lagwagon tracks, which come nowhere near thier music of today. Even with a few lousy tries at a more metal/punk style, this dish offers up plenty of treats for the fan of real GOOD, well written punk rock."
3,Exploring Earth Myths and Mysteries,"Anyone interested in myth and the meaning of ancient and often mysterious symbols found in regions of the earth will find this book quite fascinating. Drawing from many traditions, including ancient Greek, Celtic, Native American, Irish, Egyptian, Hindu and other world cultures, author Leviton explores the lore surrounding such mythic figures as Pan, Kokopelli, Hanuman and the Trickster as he appears in various guises.Leviton also reveals the stories behind earth's sacred sites--from the ""ley lines"" that crisscross the globe known as dragon paths, songlines, Holy Trails or light pathways to the paradise of Shambala or the geomantic Tower of Babel.Not as well-written as it might be, and sometimes a little carelessly repetitive, the book nevertheless explores over 150 mythic topics on humankind's attempt to understand the planet on which we live and our relationship to it. Tad C."
3,Disappointed,I admire grate work done by Beverly and Dereck Joubert with all they movies and books (I own many of them). I even went do Savute to see places they described in previous books.Needles to say I decided to buy this book blindly as I expected (as always) the highest quality. What was my disappointment when I discovered that this book is poorly printed and almost all photographs look gray. Even photos make in sepia look somewhat artificial. On the top of this cover picture (and many inside) is extremely out of focus. I find it hard to believe that Beverly Joubert would select such images to be printed. Those shortcomings took away all joy I expected to have reading this book.
4,A great documentary about the 1982 Rolling Stones Tour,"This movie is a fabulouos view of the first huge, modern and high scale tour of the Rolling Stones: the 1981-1982 tour.In 1981 and 1982 they performed in two different stages: stadiums and pavilions. The movie is like a documentary and shows in a very sober way how was that tour. You can see the band performing in the two kind of stages. I think that the gigs were in the States.I definitively recommend this movie! But the problem is to find it."
3,You can do better than that...,"The release is more or less pretty similar to the Brazilian Edition, yes the colors were equalized to make them more vivid, add some sharpness, and period, honestly quality wise, I was expecting something that will blow me away, and that was not the case, I'm talking of the production, the concert...well we all know the material pretty well...Another remark, stop using this crappy recycled plastic ""Green Planet Earth"" crappy cases with huge holes, these offer the minimal protection to the media, specially if you order the items alone...After watching the job done in Gimme Shelter from the 16mm film, and the one the guys did for the Kids Are Alright from a used film copy found in a basement, this is nothing to write home about..."
5,Just what I needed to get the job done!,"Couldn't find this in the local big box so ordered in here, just what I needed to get the job done."
1,This is some lame ass SHI*T,"i bought this cd hoping it would be something heavy. this is a gay band and they suck ass becauseall the musicians lack talent in so many areas. not to mention the vocalist, who by the way, is a woman. (if you want to call her that, i think she is as ugly as the music itself)Her voice lacks charisma and is horrid and opaque. she should burn in heck for being so ugly and for having that voice. O GOD IM GETTING SICK JUST THINKING ABOUT HER!!!! IM GONNA KILL MYSELF-BANG"
5,It's Royal Purple...enough said,"Swapped out transmission fluid from regular Dexron III to Royal Purple Max ATF at 100,000 miles. The RP Max ATF has made a noticeable difference in the transmission performance. Unfortunately, at almost $15 a quart you will find yourself waiting extra time for every last drip to come out of the bottle. Now considering how often transmission fluid gets replaced and how much punishment it takes, a few extra dollars now may save you a lot of dollars later."
3,"Good for some, but not for others","This book is great if your child has one of the defects listed in the contents page. I felt it gave a very detailed description of the defects listed as well as questions for the doctors and possible tests and corrections for each defect. I use this book often when talking to new parents about their child's defect. The only downfall in the book is that all 35 known cardiac defects aren't listed, so for many parents this may not be the right book for them."
5,Excellent Photos!!!!,This book is great it contains great photos and is printed on high quality paper.The photos depict Life in T&T and give a realistic view of the country.
3,you get what you pay for,Good for taking pictures of large objects that are not too far away that don't require much detail.
1,Very poor quality for both digicam and webcam,I got this camera yesterday. Picture quality very poor even in bright light. Forget about picture quality in indoor. Even webcam quality is not good. I have bought Micro Innovations webcam for [money] and it has much better quality than this one. I thought this one will have better quality.... I strongly recommend you not to buy this webcam.
2,Whats all the fuss about?,"I don't like this album, and can't listen to her voice for very long. Nothing special..."
1,Check your shipment,"Make sure to check your order upon receipt. I ordered a tub of original bubble gum and instead received a tub of 5 fruit flavors.I guess I can give it out a Halloween, but really needed regular bubble gum."
1,a flop,"I guess this book was okay. I just don't like books were the heroine's sexual excapades color my opinion of her. The plot of having her having sex with a married man was a big turn off. If a woman is that dumb ( and she made a lot of mistakes in her love life), then I really don't want to read about her. It colored my opinion of her and not in a good way. Great hero-not a great heroine."
2,Pop Punk?,"I got this cd, ... I put it in, first track is VERY catchy but very (Bad) (musically). I figure ""this must be the single, the rest will be different"" (as it turns out it wasnt even one of their singles). Song after song sounded the same.Its the bad parts of pop, with the bad parts of punk. I do NOT suggest this cd whatsoever."
4,Pop-punk?,"I've had trouble trying to understand the Riddlin' Kids sound label lately. Punk influences abound, definitely, but Blink 182? I see the perspective behinf the opinion, but the fact of the matter is, the Riddlin' Kids, without a doubt, have their own unique, somewhat-grinding sound that drives like an SUV on the highway. The Riddlin' Kids are a solid group, and though yes, their lyrics instantly bring to mind ""relationship woes syndrome,"" Riddlin Kids' driving tempos, solid, though non creative guitar playing, and the lead singer's growl-esque characteristic to his sound set them aside from mediocre pop-punk bubbles produced by MTV. A solid, good 'ol rock band for your average joe who wants a band to casually rock out to. Whether or not they're lyrics are repetitive, and whether or not they have image issues, Riddlin' Kids are a decent bunch, and hopefully their future albums will better showcase the inner creativity I know they posess."
3,Riddilin Kids -This is What I Have To Say,"Hi, a friend of mine got this cd for me on my 17th birthday.(i'm 19now) Yes I like a few songs on this cd ""I feel Fine"", ""Faithful"", ""Tina"", the remake of ""It's The End Of The World As We Know it"", but when I 1st got it I liked all the songs...but after a while alot of it does get kinda repetitive and tiresome to listen to (other than the ones I mentioned)I can't really listen to alot of the songs anymore. I advise you to be prepared and maybe borrow it from someone for a while to see if after a week or so you can still listen to alot of the songs. This gets 3 stars from me."
4,Not a bad pop punk album,If you like blink 182 and new found glory you will like this CD also. I personally dont like how the front man in NFG sounds so i dont like them but the Riddlin Kids are good. Nothing really speical but still i listen to it all the time. i first heard them on the bonus CD from the Orange County Soundtrack (that CD trocks). Thier sing I feel fine is one of my favorite... I always buy the CDs before the band is popular.Bottom line do you love pop punk Blink 182 and NFG style? if yes you will like this.
3,Good workout but repetitive,"This is a good workout to get your heart rate up, however, it seems so repetitive. Not a lot of variety in the workout. When you are doing a set, it seems like the same thing through the entire set, you want and are ready to move on to the next set already. However, in The Firms defense, it is hard to find a tape where you get a good workout without involving fancy steps or a step box."
1,Very unprofessional,"The changes are too fast. I had to put it in slow motion to get the choreography right and even then... You will spend more time on trying to figure out what to do than doing it. She does not give you any clue ahead before a new move is introduced and does not explain how to properly position your body. Instead of repeating the same move again and again so you can get comfortable doing it, she assumes it is your 50th viewing and that you know the routines 100%, she keeps changing the routines at an insane pace. She could never teach a beginner's class in a professional gym. This DVD targets experienced aerobics students only that already know all the basic and intermediate classic moves. If you want to look like a crazy headless chicken running in all directions, this DVD is for you. ;)"
4,"Great, except for the concerto","The orchestral works by Sibelius are excellent. Very dark and heavy, but dramatic and powerful. The Berlin Philharmonic is excellent on this recording.It would warrant five stars except for the recording of the violin concerto. I can hear that with a good violinist playing (unfortunately, I don't have any other recordings) it could be beautiful, but Christian Ferras at times uses so much vibrato that you can barely hear the pitch (he has one of those wide and fast vibratos that make you shiver). For instance, in the first minute or so of the first movement, there is a hauntingly beautiful violin melody against a sparse orchestral accompaniment, yet Ferras butchers it by playing far too loud and with far too much vibrato. Ferras plays the showy sections correctly technically, but musically he makes them sound terrible. He doesn't make them fit in with the rest of the concerto; he makes some sections sound almost like etudes.The rest of the CD is great. Enjoy."
1,BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Watch out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this TV from Fry's Electronics for $1399.00, I was going to buy the Panasonic TH-42PX60U BUT The Samsung looks a lot nicer than the Panasonic and for $100.00 more I thought it will be better TV as my sales person told me!!!I brought it home and it's easy to set up but the picture was not that clear and I got a BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ coming out from the back of the TV.Took it back the next day and bought the Panasonic for $100.00 less AND 10 TIMES BETTER PICTURE AND QUALITY.Go with the Panasonic and don't wate your time."
2,"Good picture, fair sound ! Horrible customer service!!!!",If you want a product that comes with the service you expect do not buy Samsung! the customer service is horrible.
5,Awesome Picture!,"Just bought this TV and received it within a week, Eagle was good with shipping, and they set up the TV to test it before they left...As for the TV, beautiful picture. Connected it to my PS3 via HDMI and blueray movies look amazing! Also, I connected an old bunny-ear antenna to it and it picks up local HD channels easily as well as regular SD.The glossy cabinet is very eye-catching and have been getting compliments since the first day it arrived. Also, it brought a soft cloth to keep it clean and avoid scratches (Works GREAT to clean the PS3's glossy finish as well).I definitely reccomend this TV, great picture for the price!!"
4,The Seduction of the Doria,"I realy enjoyed reading Deep Descent. It was very informative and full of historical facts about the Andrea Doria as well as how dive history evolved around the wreck. McMurray also explains the dangers of ""china fever"" where many divers got into trouble looking for some of the ships china. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in diving as well as wreck diving."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book after reading Shadow Divers. Technically, this book cannot even begin to compete. I would not recommend it."
4,Dive deep or not at all.,"Mr. McMurray is both insightful and entertaining in using the sinking of the Andrea Doria as the backdrop to describing the early years of TechnicalDiving. His interviews and descriptions of key characters are vivid, as are his descriptions of his personal dives on the Doria and other deep wrecks. After reading this book you'll either want to strap on a set of doubles, or take up golf."
5,Andrea Doria at it's best,"The best book on wreck diving I ever read.If you want to know about technical diving, and about the everest of wreck diving this is the book."
3,Long recounting of our auto-dependent culture,"I, too, am concerned about the decay of our cities in the name of car culture. Asphalt Nation is a nice light reptitious long read about the problems, how we got here, and a few ideas on how to fix the problems autos have wrought. While clearly written, the author is repetitive, and I think would have had more impact in a 10-20 page article."
4,"Sorrowfully, too late","Randy Brooks was a first class virtuoso, with technique almost unrivalled. Not only was he posessed of a gorgeous tone, ;his jazz and ballad work were faultless. Listen to his jazz solos, and you'll quickly perceive that he knew exactly where he was going, and had the technique to support it.With excellent arrangements by John Benson Brooks, He had a very tight, very swinging band. Soloists were first class (Eddie Caine, Harry Brooks, Stan Getz, and the inimitable Shorty Allen).As a lead trumpeter, he had few peers. Sonny Dunham told me in the late '80's that Randy was his favorite trumpeter."
5,Bubba has done it again,His first album was great but this one is definately awesome. It's very deep with te country feel with a touh of hip hop. He has outdone himself and I am looking forward to the next album!!!
1,Not for young children - should be stated on packaging.,"Our pre-K kids were sitting at a table playing with a glob of this putty. It somehow wound up on the rug under the table and has been impossible to remove. Some of it stuck to my child's clothing and wound up in his bed. We found it later but it had stuck to (and ruined) a sheet and pillowcase. Finally, some of it stuck in our dog's fur and was also impossible to remove. We tried soaking her in a bath of warm water and soap and made no dent in the glob. Finally we googled information on how to remove the stuff and found that using hand sanitizer could help break up the putty. After trying to get the stuff out of our dog's fur for about an hour, I was able to make a small dent in the glob but a huge mess. There is still putty in her fur! I can't imagine what a nightmare this would be if it had gotten in the kids' hair!!"
5,Great Quality!,My Brother has a real one (M4) and was totally impressed with the quality and authenticity of this gun! Fires so fast you can barely see the ammo coming out! It took awhile to put together but the weight and feel of the gun is awesome! Very impressed! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an airsoft M4!
1,Very disappointing.....,"My son searched and searched for a gun, when he finally found the one he wanted he used his own money to purchase this gun. It is now 11 days later and he has still not received the gun. After 6 days we contacted the seller to ask about the item and did not even get a response to an email for 4 days. This is just rediculous..."
1,"""Karaoke"" should mean LaserDisc, not audio CD.","This was a major disappointment. I was searching the Internet for Andrew Lloyd Webber Karaoke Discs for my wife's birthday. I was ecstatic when I found 2 ""Karaoke"" discs for Andrew Lloyd Webber (actually an Amazon.Com rep helped me find them). I ordered them immediately, only to find out that they were Audio CD's - not Laserdiscs!!! It totally ruined the surprise I had in store for Anna!"
5,please make a dvd,A DVD would be much appreciated by boomers such as myself.The concert is top-notch all the way!
2,It was a hardback with no cover,I am enjoying the book but I thought the book would at least have a cover. The books also had marks in it. I don't know if I would order another book from this retailer.
2,Magnets break,"You have to have this product if you have the door. Unfortunately, the casing for the magnet breaks about every 3-6 months. I have 2 cats and had the door for 3 years. We've gone through about 10 collars. It's pretty annoying, but I guess this is how the manufacturer keeps us buying their product. We have no choice.I love the door, great concept. Just annoyed that I have to keep buying collars.Amazon has the best price I've seen. Don't go directly to the manufacturer. They're pricey."
1,This does not deserve a rating of 4.5 stars.,"I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clichéd classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.An indepth and entertaining review of this album can be found at the Pitchfork Media website...I can't post the link due to strict review guidelines."
3,3 1/2 Stars. Me quedo con el primero,"Honestamente me quedo con el primer disco GET BORN por su esencia AC/DC y Stones. En este, hay mas toques Beatlescos, lo cual no es que este mal, pero, no es mi gusto. Hay canciones muy buenas y otras no tanto, en especial las baladas (que son como 4 o 5), las cuales no le llegan a las del primer album que eran a mi parecer mucho mejores"
5,Solid protection and fits the vehicle,I have used McGard locks for years with no problems. These were bought to replace Gorilla brand locks which I tried but were too short for the wheel studs and broke during the install. I will stick with the McGards from now on.
4,Enjoyable book,"I have read several of C. J. Box's books, and enjoyed all of them. This particular book had some interesting and unexpected twists."
3,Needs More Suspense,"The book was OK, the writting was OK. But many of the scenes just needed more suspense, more work pictures, more drama. Then it might get 5 stars. I have recommended this book to others but do warn them about the above. Will also read other books of his."
4,A Strong Follow Up to Open Season,"""They draw near who follow after wickedness;They are far from Your law."" -- Psalm 119:150 (NKJV)C. J. Box returns with an even better book in terms of storytelling and writing than Open Season. His targets are again environmentalists and those who oppose them, making both sides look pretty silly in their own unique ways.As I noted in reviewing Open Season, Mr. Box certainly does like to soak his stories in blood. This one has even more than Open Season ... but it's not quite as upsetting. However, if you like your mysteries to be reasonably bloodless, you'll probably find this book to be over the top.Some of the humor in this book reminds me of the books about the ridiculous ways that some people die. It's definitely graveyard-variety satire."
4,"New talent joins Nevada Barr, Kirk Mitchell","It's good to see a writer improving. C. J. Box is talented, but his first novel, *Open Season*, was short on the craft and skill that make first-rate reading. *Savage Run* shows him more in control of his story, and it takes us from a promising beginning to writing worthy of seasoned pros like Nevada Barr and Kirk Mitchell.The plot is in the editorial reviews: Apparently, there is a pogrom against environmentalists, and Box's hero, Joe Pickett, gets drawn into the action. Box weaves together environment and Wyoming history to tell his story. You will know who the villain is early on, but Box manages some good surprises nonetheless.The only quibble I have with the books is one I've seen elsewhere. Pickett is just a bit too self-effacing. A series is hard to sustain when the hero is more a victim and observer than agent of change and discovery. It's time to see Pickett grow some confidence to go with his Jimmy Stewart goodness."
2,Misleading photo.,"This product is a refill, not a complete wiper arm as the photo shows. While I can use the refills I expected the complete part."
5,Fantastic CD!,This is one of the TD's early work with great music. This is another great album from TD lovers. And if you like TD you can check out a campaign on kickstarter for new music from a new comer to the electronic music world.[...]
4,"A good, but hardly essential TD album","Unlike their previous albums, ""Exit"" doesn't reveal the entire musical range of this band. The TD staff concentrates on shorter, more melodic and commercially oriented soundscapes that are a bit trite for a once pioneering band. Just remember their prog-rock album ""Cyclone"", as they've included lots of acoustic instruments and even vocals. Despite the robotic, cold and distant feel of ""Exit"", TD are able to create an atmosphere of considerable emotional depth. Highlights are the thrilling ""Kiev mission"", the dreamy title track and the more up-tempo ""Choronzon"". Overall, this album rather runs in the category of Jean-Michel Jarre's ""Equinoxe"" with its lightweight synth sounds. As a new fan to ""old-style TD"" you'd be better off with buying some of their '70s work or the outstanding compilation ""Dream Sequence""."
4,Decent movie!,"Decent movie, even if your not a race fan the storylineis well scripted & addictive. The acting is fairly good too.It's not an Oscar winner, but I enjoyed watching it andwill keep it in my collection!"
1,Redline could have been a much better fim,"I've never seen a worse film put together than Redline in my life.Its ashame,but with alittle more effort,it could have been great.The girls and cars were beutifull,and some of the actors were not that bad,especially the main guy,Nathan Phillips,who reminded me alot like Health Leager.The ending was alittle thrilling and interesting,but who ever editted this movie should be fired."
1,horrible...just horrible,"Nice cars, and beautiful women....but the acting and the plot just plain suck. Dont waste your money."
4,obsessive-compulsice sings for four hours non-stop,"compulsive armenian-american Mudurian lives in Boston's duplex Nursing Home. Jack ""loves to sing more than anything else"" and will burst into high-speed song at the slightest provocation.Challenged to sing for a length of time-most recently by US journalist David Greenberger-he sings until somebody says he may stop. ""My repertoire is almost as big as that of Frank Sinatra""' he beams. A good job too, for his obsessive-compulsive medleys last for hours.His latest album, Downloading the Repertoire, is what can only be called a high speed stream-of-consciousness monologue to music. The 45 minute album crams in a 150-plus track listing, often repeating songs up to three times in a bid to keep on singing. Trouper!~Bizarre Magazine #80"
4,UNDER-RATED CLASSIC SIMON ALBUM!,"HOTCAKES IS BY FAR ONE OF CARLY SIMON'S BEST AND POSSIBLY MOST UNIFORM ALBUMS IN HER LONG, ILLUSTRIOUS CAREER. FROM THE OPENING SONG ""SAFE & SOUND"" TO THE CLASSIC CLOSING SONG OF ""HAVEN'T GOT TIME FOR THE PAIN"", SIMON SEEMS TO MAINTAIN A MATURE ATTITUDE YET SLIP IN SOME OF HER TRADEMARK KOOKINESS FOR GOOD MEASURE. ""FOREVER MY LOVE"" AND ""JUST NOT TRUE"" ARE MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THE ALBUM (POSSIBLY OF SIMON'S WHOLE CAREER). WHILE SOME PEOPLE DON'T SEE THIS RECORD AS BEING AS GOOD AS NO SECRETS (CLASSIC, ALSO MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF HERS)I TEND TO SEE IT AS A WORTHY FOLLOW-UP TO THAT HUGELY SUCCESSFUL ALBUM. AND ALL EXCEPT FOR THE SILLY, BORDERLINE STUPIDITY OF THE TITLE SONG, THIS ALBUM, WITHOUT QUESTION, BELONGS IN EVERY CARLY SIMON FAN'S COLLECTION."
1,Worst Computer Ever Purchased,"I received the NEC Mobilepro 780 Portable Computer in the worst condition you can ever imagine a computer being shipped in. I was incredibly angry over the condition of the computer. The seller Jtcamp indicated that the computer was in ""very good"" condition, however, when I received the device it looked as if someone ran over it with a truck. I would never have purchased this product if I knew that I could receive something in this condition."
3,"Well written, but . . .","It seemed to me that this book was too much of a historical book. That is, when you were reading it, you kept on remembering that it was a 'historically correct' story. I think that a really good historical book would make it seem like you were living in those times, which this book undoubtedly didn't. This book made me feel as if I was looking at a different time, instead of living in that time. Still, the plot was relatively good and I enjoyed reading about Peggy, the spoiled society belle."
5,Finishing Becca: A True Bedside Companion,"Rinaldi has really done it again in this beautiful retelling of the story of Peggy Shippen and Benedict Arnold. The story's charecters are portrayed in a vivid, believable form and the story is moving, well-written and historically correct."
4,A well written book about the personal life of Peggy Shippen,This story has been well thought out but the ending was not very conclusive. It is hard to read a story when all you have for an ending is a sudden rush of information and then you are done. The storyline on the other hand is excellent! Not only did it reach out in detail but of persice description of how Peggy Shippen Arnold handeled her spoiled little self during the war.
4,Classic. When SNL AND NBC had a Hit in their Hands.,"Ferrell And Katan, This was when NBC had a Hit on their hands(Excluding the office the only good thing left on NBC) SNL when it was funny, this movie is a direct result of that. Very funny. stupid funny and silly."
3,"""EMILIO!!!!!!!""","""A Night at the Roxbury"" is a surprisingly entertaining look at two lowlife club-hopping brothers who are ridiculously inept. It is funny to see them strut their stuff, while believing that they are looking great but their not.Funny"
5,"""Roxbury"" TOTALLY rocks!!!!!!","this is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time, it had me cracking up nearly the whole time. i loved it and i'm not even a fan of SNL. i'm definitely going to buy it when the price goes down. i'd recommend it to ANYONE that loves to laugh. REAL RIOT!!!!!"
4,Dumb & Dumber At The Disco,"Here's another modern-day comedy which automatically means two things: lots of sex jokes and stupid-but-harmless and funny characters.This ""dumb and dumber"" movie features two geeks who want to enter a disco and later want to own one.....all to get chicks, of course. It does have some very good disco music; somewhat likable leads; and an entertaining supporting cast - from the parents (Dan Hedyaa and Loni Anderson are a hoot!) to the bimbos to the exercise trainer.The movie also is short, which was a good move. You can only take so much of these idiot Butabi brothers, played by Will Ferrell and Chris Kataan. This gets a little sappy at the end when the brothers feud, but overall it's a pretty good lightweight comedy with a good share of laughs."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed this saga!,"My husband and I watched all episodes over a 10 day period. We both thoroughly enjoyed it. The only issue we had with it was that the last few episodes did not include one or two of the major characters. They were major characters in the story but were left hanging, while the rest of the characters had a resolution to their roles. Highly recommend to individuals who enjoy period pieces and the English countryside."
5,A good entertainment,"If you are looking for a series to watch as a family, this is good. the characters become part of you and when the series finished, we were left wishing there was more. Minnie is my favourite with her simple and honest life. Loved Alf and his desire to be responsible for all that was his. Emma and Roberts relationship was encouraging and Laura is beautifully acted - I could go on with every character. Great entertainment and good acting. Loved it.Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season Three"
5,Can't Put It Down,I have thoroughly enjoyed this series and am hoping it will continue beyond Season 4. I especially love the insight it provides. Love the English accent and especially love Dorcus Lane. I am facinated by how she speaks so eloquaintly.
4,love all the seasons,"I loved all the seasons, but the last season seemed a little rushed toward the end. Other than that, they were a great series!"
4,A Fun Read!,"This book was a fun read, full of entertaining characters who coexist in a world where fantasy meets reality. I enjoyed Harrison's writing style, which reminded me a little of Janet Evanovich with a paranormal twist. The story moved along quickly and kept me entertained."
4,Satisfies the Anita Blake fix,I was so happy to have stumbled on to this book! It's got all of my favorite brew of elements: girl power and vampires! If you liked the concept of the Anita Blake novels and southern vampire novels being set in an alternate universe where the supernatural and humans co-habitate - then this is for you.The only thing that I disliked was that the characters and the plot were only developed enough to make you itch for the sequel or series!Other than that it was great!
2,Not good enough,"The book is funny and in a way entertaining but I would rather read someone who has a different take on vampires like J R Ward or even Lynsay Sands, I am really tired of the same Undead, cannot be in the sun and will burn or be in great pain if it touches a cross ... I appreciate that it was a freebie and will not get the rest of the series unless I can get at the library for free and again maybe not .. dissapointed."
5,Loved it,I absolutely loved this book and am enjoying reading Kim Harrison's other books. Highly recommend.
4,Love it,"This is one of my favorite series - the characters are fun and well-written, and I am always left wanting more. The first time I read Dead Witch Walking, though, there was so much going on that I got kind of confused and I almost didn't bother to read the next book. That would have been a mistake! Stick with the series, then come back and re-read - it is totally worth it."
3,Two faced book,"Two faced book. I was ready to give it up at the first half, then it got muuuuuch better. I don't know why the author insisted so much on the strange relationship between Ivy and Rachel, it made no sense. Well, it made sense, but it was built in a confusing way and I ended up disliking Ivy and not really understanding Rachel's terror. I know it's the first book in the series, so the author is building the foundation of the rest of it, but it was sometimes confusing and sometimes boring. The second half was very good, full of action and it became impossible to put down. Jenks is fantastic. At his first appearance I didn't really like him, but he's such a stress relief whenever he appears that just seeing his name down the page made me smile. I'll read on."
2,Boring,"I read the first 100 pages of this book. It is boring. Contrary to advertising, the main character is not sexy or exciting. She does not have much confidence and she describes herself as flat chested with frizzy hair. Also the book is way too steeped in fantasy for my taste. The lead character actually has a pixie named Jenks that tags along and rests on her earring.Don't waste your money, or more importantly don't waste your time: )"
2,"Inconsistent plot, disappointing ending","I am not particular nor a snob. I read all sci/fantasy from Bradbury to Harry Potter. I am very surprised at the good reviews for this book. It is Junior High level writing and plot. I have never written a review but I wanted to warn people about this book. There are three major issues in the plot that are never answered, but they are not interesting enough to be cliff hangers for the next book. The character makes stupid decisions that truly should lead to her demise. I began cheering for the bad guy. The main character was often confused and uninformed both about the magical world and the human world. It is as if she has lived in a bubble her whole life. A lot of the book was borrowed from Jim Butcher's series. It is easy for me to suspend disbelief, but even in this magical world, the events were not believable and the characters were not consistent. The end was woefully disappointing. Please do not waste your time like I did."
4,Ummm...,"I like my stories to make me laugh so was excited to read the reviews and find a ""witch"" book that was supposed to be fun.While I really enjoyed the book and have bought several more of the series, it wasn't as funny as I expected. It did not have the laugh out loud hilarity that I was hoping for.I would definitely recommend this book as I found the story to be very readible and thoroughly enjoyed meeting Rachel and her friends; I look forward to more of her adventures."
2,"OK, but lacking.","An OK first novel. I definately would NOT compare it to the Dresden Files as others have done. The feel is completely different, a few elements are similar, but overall it is very different.I'm kind of luke warm on this book. It was good enough to finish, but not what I'd consider a page turner. The premise is kooky and quirky (which I generally like), but the story takes itself too seriously to really be comedic. And the premise is too kooky to take it seriously.The villians are also kind of in between. Not really stock, but not really unique. Even the main villian is rather ambiguous, so you don't really have any idea of what kind of charecter they are. I also had a hard time really getting into the heroine's head.I doubt I will read any more of this series, but if I saw it at the used books store for the right price..."
4,"Took a little while to get into, but began to enjoy immensely","This book is slow to build up to the plot. The plot gets bogged down by being the first in a series - there is a lot of introductions and backstory that needs to be set into place. About halfway thru the book, things fall into place, and the plot really picks up pace and makes more sense. You get a more thorough feeling of who Rachel Morgan is, and the purpose of the book.I nearly put it down, but hearing many good things about this series helped me continue to push forward, and I am glad that I did. I'm really interested in the Hallows and the characters that we met in this first of the series, as well as the secrets that were hinted at regarding character motivators, and I'm curious to see where the series heads into Book 2.I do recommend this book - there aren't overly sexual connotations in this book, as you will find with others of the genre (at least not in this first book in the series.)"
4,Good Read,"I picked up this book based on a recommendation from a reading group I am a part of. Tho I didn't love it as much as they did, it was still a good way to spend a weekend, and a great first novel - they can only get better, right?The plot moved along, tho you were sometimes left wondering ""why bother?"". I enjoyed the main character a lot when she wasn't turning herself into a mink. I didn't have a problem with the shape chaging as much as I did the author's representation of what a mink is. I raise ferrets, and worked at a rescue that rehabilitated mink. They don't make the sounds she wrote about, they don't perceive the world the way she portrayed. But it's fiction, so we overlook it - right?Other than that - it's a great first effort with enough mystery/suspense to keep the pages turning - and a main character who isn't perfect, and who's mistakes and personality quirks have a visible impact on the plot. I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here."
4,Good Paranormal Book,"I liked this book. If you enjoy supernatural/paranormal books you will enjoy this one. It does not have a romantic element that so many of this genre has, and is not as sensual as some others. It has a touch of humor and keeps the reader entertained.The book leaves the reader with a lot of unanswered questions. Does this mean a sequel is coming?"
4,Good Book -,The book is great - a fun read. I will have to purchase the books in this series that came before!
2,true Harry!,"Seriously, if you are a Harry Chapin fan, is there anything that isn't good? It was just what I excepted and hoped for. A blast from the past and a view into days gone by...RIP Harry!5 stars!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Footage - Must Have for Jane's Fans,"Other reviewers have complained about the video not living up to the ""hype"". Well thank god I never heard any of that hype because my expectations must have been lower and thus I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I went to the show in Las Vegas at the Alladin theater and was happy to see footage of that show included. Much like Soul Kiss and the Gift, this video is demented and all over the map. It's much less a movie and much more a highlight reel of the Relapse Tour.There is not a lot of official Jane's paraphernalia out there so for the real Jane's fan this is a must. Drop the expectations, sit back and enjoy this one with some fine wine and it's sure to bring peace to your mind."
4,Great Allegory,"This book is so great. It is a allegory ,but based on aBiblical concept.I read this book and lent it out.Is is so good that I purchased it again so I can have it in my library"
2,Disappointing to this Furst Fan,"I have previously read two of Furst's novels (Kingdom of Shadows and Spies of Warsaw), and enjoyed both. I am 1/5 through this one and don't plan to finish it.Furst's writing here is self-consciously literary and allusive, and the book suffers for it. All Furst's books are atmospheric, but here one feels he is simply trying too hard to be dark and romantic. Frequent brief flashbacks, with little significance, make the story choppy and hard to follow. The lead character, an expatriate Russian poet, is far less interesting, and less believable, than in the two other books I'd read.I can still recommend Furst, but suggest you skip this one."
2,first and may be my last,"I occasionally enjoy reading historical fiction to give some flavor and background to history that is my prefferred read. The only reason it received 2 stars from me was that it did provide that. However, it was really disappointing and good evidence that if you are reading non-fiction, stick to the classics and don't risk wasting your time. I may give him a second chance at some point, but probably won't."
4,A Great Geography Lesson,"This one of my favorites of Furst's pre- early-WWII novels. From the US, we often forget how close most of European countries are to each other. Furst must have traveled the route of his main protagonist in this story of trying to stem the flow of oil from Romania to Nazi Germany. Things have changed, but not much."
2,WELL.....,I bought this CD but I have to say it sounds like everything else. Its ok but I think that it could have been done a little better job on it.
2,Too heavy,"In my opinion, they are too heavy. I have to throw them almost as hard as I can for them to stick into the board. Usually they stick into trees easily, but not always. Also, the rotation is different from my other throwing knives. I have to stand in a different spot and almost chuck them at the board and still, they fall out a lot."
5,Listen to it always,"It's hard to tell where Cold After is coming from. They're not exactly goth. They're not exactly alternative but for lack of anything else to compare them to I'll just say the music is compellingly gorgeous, sligtly dark pop. If you like good songwriting like I do, check them out. This band from Tallahassee Florida exhibits a great sense of melody, catchy instrumental hooks, interesting changes and moody sounds; every cut on this CD is a pleasure to listen to. There's a nice dose of bass eigth-notes, edgy guitars and haunting keyboards, weaving in and out perfectly in line with the songs. Combine that with Wendy Wallace on vocals and you've got a winner. This CD is definitely going into my ""listen to it always"" stack."
4,an unexpected pleasure,when i picked up this book i did not expect it to be this well written and interesting. It has the usual aspects of wizards and magic yet it adds something special with a touch of mythology. I enjoyed reading this book very much.
4,Fantasy to a 'T',"This book is your picture-perfect fantasy novels to my idea. This may or may not be to what you like. Some books need feeling and realness, and difference to make them real, you know. I found this was not the case at the begining of this book. Steriotipical image of 'beutiful' girls, glowing eyes, pretty normal stuff. But then it got a very lot better, the characters are real, you grow attached to them, they become more real. I ust say I liked the relationships between people in the Last Wizard part, Lord Death and Crystal and the two brothers different afections for one another intertwined, (taking a little out of Lord Death, I might add, :) were very interesting. It was a great book, more there than just fantasy, I guess!"
2,Not what I expected,"I have been a long standing fan of Springsteens, and old enough to have bought Born to Run when it was first released. I also had the pleasure of seeing Springsteen live at the Madison Square Garden the year after The River was released, and it was absolutely amazing.So I was very diassapointed to hear the collection of lifeless, uninspired performances on this album.This album is actually boring, which I didn't think I would ever be able to say about live Springsteen. Who ever chose the material for this album did a very poor job."
4,Sel Help Book,"I enjoyed this book very much - although a Self help book, it is informative and fosters growth through treatment."
1,Very Disappointing,"My mother has narcisstistic-histrionic personality disorder, an intensely pathological condition far more destructive than the type of narcissists this book addresses. I already knew much of what was in the book, in terms of identifying a narcissist (no doubt in her case, as she had been diagnosed by multiple therpists). The impacts of having a parent with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) are similar to what is described in the book (again, no news for me) but the suggestions for recovery are too basic and simplistic for someone with a parent with NPD. I did not find at all the relief I hoped for in reading about others who had experienced what I had gone through."
5,Makes old classics even better,"I love this CD. They have taken old classics and with their own twist made them even better. You will know what I mean when you hear it. ""Joseph's Lulliby"" is exactly how I picture Joseph must have felt the night Jesus was born. To hold this tiny king and know the road ahead of him. But for now my son...just sleep... wow, what a great song.I highly recommend this CD to anyone trying to capture the Christmas spirit again."
4,nice,I like this but it wasn't my favorite compared to other Mercy Me cds- the variety of music styles from song to song didn't seem the same to me as other albums.
2,Beautiful but Impractical,"These tumblers look great, but cannot stand up to actual use. A sharp glance will take the paint off."
3,Looking for disc 1,I have two copies of disc two and looking for someone with 2 copies of disc one to trade with.
2,narrow metal groove siding,"Cutting the 9"" wide narrow groove metal is hard cutting up and over the narrow slots. I think it would work better on the wider groove metal siding."
3,Awkward and not very useful,"If I were to do it again, I'd pay more for real shears.It's an awkward layout, hard to hold or control.Maybe ok for cutting large flat sheets, but not for more complex or smaller shapes."
3,Use caution in submitting the test in this book!,"The contents of this book are satisfactory. I just wish there was more detail on many of the topics, but I guess that is why there are additional books available. I personally had some issues with the testing instument in the back of the book when I submitted it. However, after some time and extra emails I did finally receive the certificate mentioned. It sounds as if the IAHSSP is in a transition period so contact at this time is slow. If you do submit the test be patient and persistent!"
4,Locksmith Must Read,This book is probably the best book for the beginning locksmith to read in order to get a good basic knowlege of most locking mechanisms and also a good knowlege of locksmithing techniques. This is also a good reference book for the advanced locksmith also.
5,Hard To Beat!,"The first five songs on this album (side one of the vinyl) alone are worth the price of admission - the six remaining songs (side two) are icing on a very tasty cake.I'm sorry now that I took so long to buy the re-mastered version of this wonderful album. It sounds so much better than the original CD. All of the instruments have much better definition, and the overall sound is about as warm as you can hope a digital transfer can get. Not as warm as vinyl, of course, but very listenable. The 12 string guitars on ""People's Parties"", for instance, sound like they could be in your living room (to use a well worn phrase). This is a vast improvement over the previous release! I hear something new each time I play this - and I even have the 4-channel ""quad"" version of the vinyl!It's always a treat when a favorite album gets a proper re-mastering, and this is better than I could have hoped for. I can't help but wondering how good this would sound in a 5.1 version. Maybe someday."
3,Burned brighter before,"The seminal sensual songstress second cited song set suggests the lightening in a bottle caught with effortless grace on Blue would never repeat, as self-conscious arranging overshadows sincere delivery."
2,mistake,What I thought was a CD purchased turned out to be a cassette. This was to be a birthday gift so I had to make other arrangements.
1,"Eddie Fisher, Just OK","The excellent sound from this CD only accentuates Fisher's unease in his forced banter from this live performance. There are a lot of Jolson songs which I would rather hear Jolson singing (in sound this good), in particular ""That Wonderful Girl of Mine,"" which seems to be unavailable in all the Jolson collections. Eddie Fisher made some very good recordings in the 50's, backed by Hugo Winterhalter. Those are still his best."
2,There is no music from the 20's here...,"this is all 1930's music, as the other reviewer seems to have his decades mixed up. There are plenty of Crosby tunes, and this sounds like a somewhat mechanical 30's recreation band of mostly boring 30's society music, not hot dance music. Try Mora's Modern Rhythimists for a more exciting 30's recreation band."
5,A classic,"What's this album about? Driving in the rain, broken hearts and dreams, true love, and loneliness. Falling down drunk and landing on the moon--the stories of the night city. A poet giving form and rhythm to the musings of the soul. American music, straight up, and from the heart. This came out in 1974, and just like the mentioned Napoleone's Pizza House, it is still around, delivering the goods."
1,knives rust in dishwasher,I purchased this knife block and then returned it for the same item because mine would rust every time I put them in the dishwasher. The company asssured me this never happened before and sent me out a new set only to do the same thing. I have to brillo the rust off when they come out of the dishwasher. Would not recommend these unless you want to do the same!!!
5,Tops! Right up there with the big name authors!! LOVED IT!,"This read was a wonderful surpise!! I'd never heard of Majd before this book & it literally had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Very talented author who will be HUGE one day VERY soon! Characters were very authentic & the technological expertise on Majd's part was stunning! That's what really made the book so fabulous! Especially since the 9/11 attack to see a Mom up there in a plane trying to land it with the chance of dying & speaking to her daughter on the phone--it had me crying,too!! I can't wait for the next book--if it's half as good as this one I'll buy it the DAY it comes out!!"
4,"like opera, but better","Bach's Hunting Cantata, written for the non-religious world of the court of the financially-chaotic Duke Christian in the early 1700s Prussian scene -- is a jeu d'esprit that probably made Bach laugh inside. The Duke only cares about hunting, while his beautiful estates pine for the care of a wiser head. Or at least that's my interpretation. It's got some great riffs."
5,books i need,good place to find the right book as needed to make my set completed as i read the books by series
4,Good ending to a decent series,"While I am a fan of V.C. Andrews...after her death during the Casteel Series, things have fallen by the wayside. The Gemini series has been one of the best so far. While the ending might have been a bit too predictable, I still enjoyed it. Can't wait for the next series to start."
4,Not Just Theory---Plenty of Useful Leadership Tactics,"I bought this book because my employer, like many large multi-national companies, is dealing with cultural change and leadership issues involving the development of a new global infrastructure to more efficiently engage and win large mega-deals requiring resources from multiple country locations. This book very clearly describes the various cultural issues and the important role of leadership in cross-cultural integration. It covers theory behind cultural behavior, but more importantly, it provides real-world insight into cultural dynamics. Moreover, it provides clear tactical advice for assessing your own company's cultural dynamics. It provides good, sound leadership advice in the context of cultural integration and change management."
3,Lovely pictures,"This story is laden with very human responses from the parents to the children but I found it a bit critical of the main little girl. She loved art and the solitude of the water. Ultimately she takes herself back to it when a late teen (I presume) and also onto art school. Loved the child's spunk but had a hard time getting past the parents critical ways. Lovely art by Barbara Cooney, as always."
4,Great Addition to my Toolbench,This is a very useful vise with sturdy fasteners and adjustments all around. Perfect for the light to medium duty I need it for.
1,Overwritten and Uninspired,"Due to Roiphe's insufferable tendency to place each of her personal experiences in the context of global events, I was completely exhaused by chapter two."
2,"Over Sold, Under Delivers","The course consists of warm up exercises and scales. Anyone familiar with Bel Canto will find these exercises familiar.Unfortunately, the course doesn't provide much in the way of context. For example, the scale exercises ascend through the octaves and you're expected to follow them with ease, or you're advised not to ""go any higher than you feel comfortable with"". If you don't have a wide range to start with, this course is unlikely to deliver one.I ended up ditching the course and teaching myself from technical books on singing, singing along to CDs, listening carefully, and focusing on getting the best out of my natural vocal range. I made much faster progress than I did with Singing Success.Your mileage may vary."
2,typical math text,"Sadly, this book does not live up to itsreputation and can only be used by thosealready having a working knowledege ofthe subject. On top of that, the printingis atrocious in places - unacceptable foran expensive item."
1,Very disappointed,"Open Up My Heart: The 9-11 AlbumThe CD that I purchase had the same outer packaging but different inside packaging. The CD on Amazon list at least 10 songs, mine had only eight listed and they weren't the same songs. I mainly purchase this CD for the song, ""I'm Only A Man"", the song isn't listed on this CD but its on the one advertised.1. Open Up My Heart - Edited 3:362. Where Do We Go 4:313. Open Up My Heart - L.A. Long 13:214. Does Anybody Know I'm Here - 3:245. Open Up My Heart - Chicago Long 12:536. Star Spangled Banner 12:477. Open Up My Heart - 8min Original 8:028. Killer K 5:36Are there two versions of this CD that's packaged the same."
3,know your way around amazon,"as of 28 february 2012 it's cheaper to buy each season individually. for some reason the price on this 'set' keeps going up. this isn't some remastered re-release. it's the same set they had here when it first came out. if you're in a hurry, get this. if you're interested in saving some money, every season is available right from this same site."
5,Enjoyable book!,Almost A Bride (Wyoming Wildflowers) (Harlequin Special Edition)A fast read. I love to have something light to read while walking my treadmill. Makes the time pass so much faster. Will keep my eye open for more of her books.
4,Almost a Bride,This was an easy read - nothing to deep or mind boggling. It's the kind of book you pick up at the end of the day to relax with. I will definitely seek out other books from this author.
3,Plot which is almost a genre within the genre,"The premise of a character marrying another for less than romantic reasons is traditional within the romance genre. The idea that a sexless marriage can last for the contracted time between the parties has been used so many times that it is a tired format. This novel is no exception and the ending is entirely predictable and somewhat flat.The book is well-written and the character of Dave is engaging, though what he wanted Matty for is beyond me. I am sure he could have done better than this badly-behaved, childish woman whom I wanted to slap most of the time. I thought she was supposed to be 30-ish but she comes across like a teenager.The story overall was okay, but I don't see it as a ""keeper."""
2,otherwise ok,"Not what I was hoping for... I like CHRISTIAN novels, definately too much info for that. I skipped a lot of pages because of content. Don't need the details. Don't draw me pictures. Don't want any form of porn!"
1,boring,"it was too long and boring. the hero and the heroine were nice. i liked them. it was remarkable for the hero to rescue the heroine most of their lives, but if you love someone, you do not let other people cloud your judgemnt."
4,Great,This book was great. I really enjoyed it. It was perhaps a little predictable but would recommend to other people who are after something as an in between books.
3,Almost a Bride,"The book was an easy read, too easy, too simple. Just your typical romance but with cowboys. OK if you are really bored."
3,"A great team, reunited!","We love the Tenth Doctor (""Ten""). Sarah Jane is the model modern companion. She helped by talking sense to him -- don't give in to your nostalgia. Now, it's Ten's turn -- on her happiest day, Sarah Jane is kidnapped. The Doctor teams up with teenagers to bring her back."
1,What Season 3?,"Whether Prime or Purchased for streaming, the episodes labelled Season 3, with Season 3 titles, are actually Season 4. If this had actually been the episodes from Season 3, I would have given it 5 stars for sure!"
2,"Too much Fan Service, not enough substance","Yumiko Readman is ""The Paper"", a bibliophile who can make paper do anything she likes (she loves it and it loves her). She works for the British Library to retrieve rare books. In the first volume, she also meets one of her favorite novelists, Nanene Sumiregawa, who is endangered by a fan. It is up to Yumiko to protect her.R.O.D. Read or Die has an interesting concept (people who love something so intensely that they control it), but the story isn't all that interesting. There's a lot of sexual tension and ""fan service"", but the art style is not unique and the action scenes are too much. I haven't seen the anime, so I cannot compare the two, but I will give the anime a shot in the future. As for the next R.O.D. volume, I'll skip it."
2,completely different,"The storyline in the manga pre-dates the orginal anime release and the television production. It involves a few of the character in the original but only a couple. The manga leaves the orginal fan base and delves into new territoy, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. The character designs head for the 18+ and male only crowd while the plot line drops down into the 10+ age group. Sadly, I won't be buying the rest of the series."
4,Reminds me of Tom Clancy,"The animation was great, but the plot was a little slow. It reminded me very much of the hunt for red october."
5,Great ring at a great price...,"I just ordered this ring on Sunday night and it arrived Wednesday... Very fast shipping. The ring itself is gorgeous... even better than in the picture. I had my finger measured and the lady told me to order a 9 1/2. After reading some reviews I saw that these comfort-fit rings run a little big so I ordered a 9 and it fits perfect. The ring comes in a very nice little black box with a black ribbon and bow (doesn't look girly at all). Very nice product, fast shipping and nice packaging... what else could you ask for?Before I bought this ring I looked at some other styles. The local jewelry store had a tunsten/carbon-fiber ring on display that was very nice and cost $300.00. I got home and looked online. I found similar rings for about $100.00 but I read that the carbon-fiber an scratch easily. I found this solid tungsten ring instead for a lot cheaper. In the end, I like the look better and it was a lot cheaper. Definitely recommend this ring to others."
1,extremely boring,"This album is really overrated. Yes, it's not black metal and not even metal at all just really boring acustic album. I do not care if it's norwegian or nigerian, it isn't worth a damn. This should have been a side project only. Very lame and to top it off, you won't understand what they're lame whining is about. I think it deserves 1 star for somewhat nice artwork. avoid."
5,Sequel-Well Deserved,"I enjoyed reading the second part of this book just as much as the first. They say that things are better the second time around and they were not lying it this case. When Souls Mate should be on the best sellers list! I was able to tap into the previous book within this book with the references. Many times a sequel will come out but by that time you have already forgotten what the first part of the book was about. Joy is an excellent writer with a vivid imagination. She writes with her readers in mind. This book will definitely make you shed a tear. It speaks karma, passion, love and fate all in the same! The book was outstanding but The Root of All Evil must be read first!"
4,Great gift for Buddhism students,My sister in law is studying about Buddhism and was thrilled to receive this gift. It looks and feels heavy - good quality.
4,Subscribe-and-save every 6 months to remind you to change your smoke detector batteries!,"I subscribe-and-saved on these items for every 6 months as a reminder to change my smoke detector batteries. I have a battery tester though and really only probably have to be changing them every 12 months given that whenever I've tested them, they've shown full power. Having them come in the mail though as a queue that I need to check them is so great. I could use an email or to-do service for it. But the added steps of having to get the batteries if you do need them seems so unnecessary. Besides, with 3 kids in my house, there are more than enough toys to make use of these batteries if the smoke detectors don't end up needing them."
1,Off beat rythym,"Gilbert and Sullivan tried to do something with opera that should have never been tried. The English language doesn't do opera justice. English just doesn't have the smooth flow as Italian does. Whenever I hear Giblert and Sullivan, I feel like a chicken pecking at grain just trying to keep up with the rythym. Definetly a must skip!"
2,"I love Sunn, but I couldn't stand this","I love Sunn and Earth. But this cd bored me so much that I had to sell it. Simply put, this was missing the subtlety and maturity that are behind Sunn's other stuff that makes it interesting. It really did feel like they were just playing riffs (or whatever you'd call it) without the sensibility that keeps it from being trite and makes it profoundly affecting and absorbing. I still come back to the beginning to The Flight of the Behemoth with a lump in my throat ( you know where it sort of ""kicks in""? ), but Grimmrobe had no moments like this. But at the same time, I could see someone digging this, because it isn't BAD: it is heavy after all."
1,Linda Ronstadt's only dud,Except for the Neil Young covers this album is a mess! The songs just don't hold up. Buy any other Ronstadt album and you will be pleased buy MAD LOVE and you will be turned off.
5,A Must Read!,"I am not one much into the Royal Family and received this book as a gift. However, from the moment I opened it I was hooked and read it straight through to the end. Princess Diana died just one week after I had finished the book, and I am very thankful for having read it, because it helped me to understand what she and Fergie must have gone through. I did not expect to enjoy the book so thoroughly and found that I could relate to Fergie. My Story is now one my all time favorites."
2,I could hardly make it to the end,"While I agree that this poor woman has been treated terribly by both the press and the Royal Family, this book was so whiny I could hardly get to the end. Practically every sentence contains some self-berating statement. While she says at the end that she has overcome, the book doesn't read that way. I'm glad I only paid [$] for this book at the used book store."
1,A woman of little taste or style,What a perfectly ghastly woman. She is the living embodiment of vulgarity.
5,Great finishing sander,"This finishing sander is a pleasure to use. I usually use a Dewalt 5"" random orbit sander for finishing the face of my work pieces as it is very ""error proof"". However, I find a random orbit sander difficult to use on the edge of boards and in corners.The Makita sander fills in where my Dewalt is lacking. Don't get me wrong the Makita is a wonderful finishing sander for the face of boards too but I am not a gifted woodworker and enjoy the forgiveness of the random orbit sander.The only problem I have had is the plastic frame for the dust bag. The frame broke as I was replacing the dust bag. I don't know if it was cracked from the manufacturer or if I broke it. I am going to contact Makita and will let you know if their customer service is good or lacking.Very slow on the update!!Contacted Makita and had a new frame shipped to the local Makita service center. Service was great and the price was reasonable."
3,Good album,"Good album, the recording equipment is a little subpar(read my review of Vol 1 for Details.) And for the highly learned individual from the enlightened ""free state"" of Maryland, for your enlightened information, the word ignorant is spelled with an A, not ""ignorent""."
4,His greatest original,"Im glad I got this one.It was long overdue.Harry put together some of the greatest songs dealing with heavier topics..love gone bad,slave labor,injustice.He also had a way of combining the common bond of the working poor and unfortunate..you can tell he was there and didn't forget it.His softer style still hit the soul with his creative,no-nonsense lyrics.Its most unfortunate he left us way too soon."
4,Its good for the price..,"Good for the price, it seems like the hose doesnt pull out and push in as smoothly as I would have liked. Overall for the price- a great faucet."
5,The most beautiful book I've ever read,"Masterful. Quite possibly the most beautiful book I've ever read, for and about human beings on this earth. The reflections, observations and guiding hopes in Dear Little One will accompany my kids now, and throughout their adult lives. I can't think of another book that does that. This book is unique. And poignant. And ultimately the kindest gift."
4,Very good,Very good. Their live album is a touch better but I enjoy this one very much. Would buy again.
3,if it fit better I'd give it 5 stars,"It's thin, it's protective, it's not as slippery as the pearl, but it doesn't quite fit. It doesn't conform to the curves of the phone, and thus both the top and bottom aren't actually attached to the phone. I tried just tossing it in my pocket, but the protector kept getting caught and pulling off. It's less than a millimeter, but it's enough to snag.I'm now using it with a silicone jacket to hold it down. If it fit right, or conformed to the phone's curves it would be perfect.I'm thinking about going at it with scissors..."
4,Good quality,Product was clean and in a good package. As I could not find this item locally I looked to Amazon. Price seemed a touch high except I have not shopped mung dal recently and that might not be fair. In any event I was glad to get it anyway. I purchased it with tumric spice also and was impressed by the packaging on both items. These people seem to take care of their products.
1,Awful,"I read some of the glowing reviews and ordered this CD. I really like John McCuthcheon, but this is not at all what I expected from one of the great folk-singers. Just light dulcimer elevator type music on this CD. Only song worth listening to is Christmas in the Trenches. The rest is just not very much of anything other than light tapping on a dulcimer. If you like that type of stuff, then go for it. I like to hear songs with actual lyrics."
5,Its fine,"Though it was expensive relative to my local grocery shop, it met my expectations. The overall quality is quite good."
1,Joni didn't get around to writing any tunes,"Apparently, she went into the studio with an acoustic guitar & Jaco Pastorius & not much else. There's one great track called OFF NIGHT BACKSTREET, which includes a fun recurring appearance of Jaco's high-register bass-pings. The title track is a mediocrity that uses a glissando bass-pulse. At the end of the title track, Joni threw in some background singing. Too little too late. The title track would've been a lot more interesting if it had contained her background singing all the way thru it. TALK TO ME is a pretty good song lyric. Unfortunately there's no tune attached to it. Which raises the obvious question: is TALK TO ME deliberately tuneless for the purpose of expressing the desperation of the narrator?"
5,Adapter,"It's a simple adapter, what does anyone expect me to write about that? It's dark and shiny? Two-ended? Feels solid in my hand? The dumb thing works. Knightsix"
2,Good story nearly wrecked by bad acting,The actors in this are for the most part so bad that they ruin much of what might have been a more effective story of a haunted house with deadly entities wreaking havoc at night.
4,The Rape of the Nile,"This is a must for anybody who has visited Egypt to understand what the Western World has stolen from this country. The amount of antiquities taken by the British , French and Germans is mind boggling. The book is well written and a great source of reference with information broken down into several periods in History finishing off with Howard carter. Well recommended and easy to read"
2,Second Thoughts,"My Grandson is 3 and hyperactive. He doesn't sit still long enough to listen to the DVD. There's a lot of talking, not enough music to grab his attention. I feel it's for an older child. I even tried to watch it when my Grandson wouldn't. It didn't work for me either."
2,My toddler was not interested at all,"I bought this for my toddler, thinking she might like to watch a video to learn about potty training. She didn't even watch it for five minutes before she lost interest and went off to play with her toys. Admittedly, she doesn't watch the Sesame Street tv show (although she knows the characters), but I was hoping for something that would at least keep her interest. I would not recommend this unless your child really enjoys the Sesame Street tv show."
4,Helpful potty video.....,"I think the video is very helpful and cute. I find nothing offensive about the word ""dookie"". As a matter of fact, when the little boy said it I cracked up for a minute or two!! Kids are funny and besides, the script writers are at fault. Anyway, my daughter loves Elmo and she laughs in delight at this video. She's at the point now where the pull ups need to go and I'll do anything to help her. In my opinion this video is just a little extra and I would definately recommend it."
2,Not Very Instructive,"My son enjoys watching and reading about Elmo but this DVD could not keep him interested. If you are looking for a DVD that goes through detailed steps about using the potty and toilet training this isn't the one for you. It is not straight forward which is what I think younger toddlers need in order to understand how the potty works. The program, for the most part, beats around the bush, dealing with matters such as everybody needs to use the bathroom, showing metaphors to keep trying even though it seems difficult and how other people use different words in reference to ""pee"" and ""poo""."
2,NOOOO Potty Training HERE!!!!,"First of all, the video itself is okay, and probably entertaining to most children. Older children, would probably actually ""understand"" the video. But, as for POTTY TRAINING content... it would have received ""0"" Stars, if I was basing it on that alone. I agree with another reviewer who suggested having Elmo and the other puppets actually ON a potty more frequently."
4,For 22 Month Old Daughter,"We bought this DVD for my 22 month old daughter, who LOVES Elmo. She enjoys the DVD because Elmo is in it, I don't know if I could go as far as to say that this DVD will help with the potty training, but at least it gets her familiar with it. The DVD is very educational as are most Sesame Street DVDs. It is not one of those kid movies that aldults will enjoy too, but as long as the kids like it then it is okay."
4,Helped my 2 year old,"My daughter just turned 2 and has been doing a really good job trying potty training w/ some success too! This really helped spur on some interest in the potty training and she asks to watch it often. I'll admit, some of the songs are a little lame, but it is for kids, not adults. On the flip side, they do a song tour of a TP factory which is kinda neat to watch w your kiddo."
4,Great for first time potty users,This video has it all.With songs and rhymes it has everything a young child needs to learn for using the potty
2,Not the best tool for potty training,"This book is written and illustrated for 1 year olds or younger, not older toddlers learning to potty train. Don't waste your money."
1,Not Helpful At All!,"This video was the least helpful potty training video ever.I have never found a movie my son didnt sit to watch;yet, this one could not hold his attention for 2 min. It really didnt have much potty training, just singing. I would not recommend this dvd to anyone."
4,great potty DVD from Sesame Street,"Before we received this dvd as a gift from the grandparents, we were reading tons of potty training books to our toddler. She seemed interested, but not excited about potty training. Once she watched this dvd, she loves to go potty and sing the songs from this dvd. Eventually, she skipped training pants and just wear underwear. Until she started preschool, then she has to wear pull up during school becasuse she keeps singing ""accident happens and that's okay"". So I have to make her watch the part about this DVD for ""pausing what you are doing and go make wee wee"". I still think it's a great tool to get children excited about potty training."
3,it's decent,"This product does brighten as it claims, but as others have said it is a bit shiny and it also doesn't conceal dry patches. It is very nice for bringing a little pop to the cheekbones and under the eyebrow."
2,children's literature,"I am sure that the author of this book had good intentions, but I do not care for the story, nor would I include the book in my classroom library. Parts of the story are positive, in that one student does learn to work with and accept a student with a disability; however, the child with autism is portrayed in such a stereotypical way that I find it offensive. There are much better books about children with autism. Don't buy this one, keep searching!"
4,Best In Series,"This was a good book. Not quite as good as watching the show, but the characters are well done and the plot is decent. However, it is the only one in the series so far that I liked. If Roger Stern writes any more for the series, I'll buy his, but not any of the other authors."
3,Good for the beginning exerciser,"Welldone video for the most part although the music and exercise sequences occasioanlly seemed a bit out of sync. very upbeat, pleasant gentle workout that would be best duited for the beginning exerciser"
4,"Good DVD, my wife was happy with it","Good DVD, my wife was happy with it. Got shipped quickly, is useful for doing excecise at home. There're more variety available though, so see for better options while this being still a good option .."
3,"Lonesome River song thrills, chills to the bluegrass bone!!!","Alas, my computer would not allow me to preview the songs from the site. I have, however, heard the song Lonesome River done from this CD on a Nashville station. It is classic bluegrass that I could listen to repeatedly, for days on end, I believe. I will be purchasing this CD. I can't wait to here the rest of the songs. I am extremely hopeful that the rest of the selections will be as soul-satisfying as Lonesome River is. I actually would have awarded more stars, based on this one song, but thought that I really should hear more than one. Thus, I awarded 3 stars as sign of great expectations."
5,Just what i was looking for,Needed to replace my old copy for my grandchildren. It was in great condition but with a few added text and pictures.
5,His best live album,"And with that title I disagree with the other reviewer of this album. I always preferred this one to Greatest Stories Live, as I always disliked the drawn out Bananas and Circle songs and found that the live W.O.L.D. didn't stand up to the studio original. On this one I just love the title track, The Day They Closed The Factory Down, If My Mary Were Here, Corey's Coming, Stranger With The Melodies and Mail Order Annie. As an album I find it more consistent than the Greatest Stories Live (which also featured 3 studio tracks - 2 of which are sadly missing from the CD re-issue)."
5,Some of Chapin's Best Songwriting,"Sure this album is not full of ""hits"" and many weren't even familiar or released prior to the live versions. But if you ever got joy from sitting and listening to Harry tell you a story, that in a few minutes made you feel like you experienced a two hour movie, this album will hold up well and give you many special moments. Some of these songs became favorites of mine and I feel any Chapin fan should give it a chance and a good listen. The more I heard it the more it grew on me. I was fortunate enough to get to see Harry live once and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life. This album helps bring back a bit of that joy, and definitely keeps Harry alive."
2,"Cool concept, but poorly executed.","I really can't wrap my mind around the fact that this flick is getting so much praise on here. The story, like so many have said, is refreshing but the poor cinematography, trying too hard acting, and the badly paced plot just really killed it for me; by the end of the movie all of the characters and plot just seem convoluted."
1,I'd recommend instead...,"Not sure why so many people are giving high ratings on this one. The acting was sub-par, the lighting design was heinous, and the production was more horrifying than the story. If you want to see a truly creepy indie horror film, check outBaby Blues. I was lucky enough to attend a private screening and was thoroughly creeped out. The acting is better than expected as is the production value. It had some truly unexpected twists. Check it out instead, it comes out on DVD in August."
1,Seriously?,"I can't believe how many people fawn over this movie. It has as much tension in it as a bag of wonder bread. This movie isn't very memorable. In fact I forgot that I had even seen it until I saw a preview for it on the Unrest disc. Then I remembered this drivel.The whole story about a family of psychopaths who are psychos ""just because"" doesn't really work. The acting was decent, it had to be to hold the weak, slow, plodding story together. The story just meanders along taking its sweet time to get to an unsatisfying conclusion. Weak production quality. Looks like someone shot it on their camera phone.Waste of a rental."
1,don't bother,the scariest part of this movie was the acting. I had to force myself to stay awake. NO THRILLS.
2,Low Rent Hostel,"In this movie, a series of young women suffer terrible torment at the hands of the creepily incestuous Hamilton Family. But when the movie finally explains the siblings' motives, it's clear their methods were not necessary to achieve their ends. So this film just ends up being an excuse to show girls being caged and tortured.There is a touch of humanity in a tentative romance that develops in this film and that partially redeems it. But on the whole, the acting tends to be a bit amateurish and the film has rather cheesy production values. So this ends up being a low-rent ""Hostel.""If you liked ""Hostel,"" you might not mind. But if you prefer more classic, character and plot driven chills, this film will probably just leave you feeling wasted. You'd do better to check out some of the other movies in the ""After Dark"" series - such as ""Penny Dreadful."""
4,A great addition to the series,"Butcher shakes things up with this one, in a good way, - I'd say the plot is much more fast paced, new characters are phased in (Michael, Lea) and old ones don't show up as much (Murphy). I liked Michael's character (Knight of the Cross) alot, and can't wait to read more about him. I also liked that the book went into much more detail about the 3 vampire courts - excellent stuff! Another great read. One plot twist after another."
2,unimaginative story,"I am an avid reader and this series is one of the worst I have ever read. I ordered the first three books together and will not be ordering any more of the series. The story is choppy and slow and boring. Not a series I would recommend which is disappointing because I have read other works by this author and could not put them down, unfortunately this series is not one of them."
2,The series started so well,"I picked up and enjoyed the first book in this series, so bought the second and third together expecting more like STORM FRONT. Unfortunately Butcher fell into the same trap so many authors have done. The reviewers compare this series to that of Laurell Hamilton, and it does do the same pattern only faster. It only took three books for Butcher to change what was a good urban fantasy/mystery about a private investigator/wizard into an attempt at a modern fantasy epic in which the main character is the pivotal element in a worldwide war between wizards and vampires.I don't understand why so many of the fantasy writers seem determined that any character they create has to become Frodo. I was looking for a nice urban fantasy/mystery like Mercedes Lackey or Tanya Huff do so well.Buy the first book, skip the rest."
5,grave peril,"This series is one that continues to get better. This times around, we learn about ghosts in the world of Harry Dresden, and the culprit has a tie-in with Book 1. The vampires also make an important appearance. We don't see so much of Karrin Murphy, but Harry's girlfriend, Susan, plays an important role. I definitely don't find their relationship believable, which is the one negative about this series. In fact, I don't even find Susan likeable. On the other hand, I greatly enjoyed the character of Micheal and hope he makes more appearances later in the series; I'd like to read an entire book about him actually. He has a lot of depth that could be explored.I've been more than pleased with the developing world of this series and am eager to begin Book 4. Jim Butcher's imagination is amazing, and Harry is lovable in that bumbling, geek kind of way."
3,A weaker third book in the Dresden series..,"I don't think this third book in the series is as strong as the first two. It might just be me but it had a different feel to it. Harry wasn't as witty or sarky and he seems to have lost a little bit of oomph.The character of Michael is strong and adds an extra element to this book, however I am not sure it is a positive one. Due to Michaels position a lot of the text between him and Harry has religious references.So Harrys says hells bells a lot for instance instead of his usual outbursts. Now that might not seem like a big issue, but it completely changes the way Harry interacts with others. Part of what made his character so likeable is the way he doesn't conform to the wishesof others.All in all I thought it was a lot weaker and hope that the next one brings the old 'devil may care, I will never lick your boots' Harry back instead the placid must watch my mouth Harry in this book.AVP-UK"
5,"Grave Peril, another fast & fun read","This series is good clean fun from beginning to end. Grave Peril is more of the same. Alternately amusing and exciting, the tale follows Harry on the trail of disturbing ghost manifestations. This is a page turner, and the ending will probably have you immediately buying the next in the series to read.My biggest gripe would be the opening scene, where Butcher info dumps in a rather clumsy fashion everything that Harry Dresden's been up to recently. Beyond that point, the story starts to run smoothly."
4,Dresden series takes a dark turn,"Grave Peril is a much darker book than either Storm Front or Fool Moon. This book has a sense of hopelessness to it that neither of the others contained, even in their darker moments. Read with caution, and read slowly. The bad guys are bigger, badder, and there are certainly more of them. The problems start even before page one, and never let up, or give room for breathing or for Harry's usual wisecracks.Michael is a welcome character addition, especially when the only other returning male character, Carmichael, was killed in Fool Moon. Murphy is noticeable by her absence, but I guess there is only room for 1 woman in Harry Dresden's life, as Susan, the reporter for the Arcane and Harry's love interest is more prevalent in Grave Peril.This is a good read, but I can't help hoping that the 4th book in the series gives Harry a little bit of a break from the nonstop terror and evil."
1,audio is lost when connected,"once again you get what you pay for. This thing does not work as it is supposed to, when connecting to the source device and then when checking on the tv's the audio is lost! in both TVs. i should pay a little more and get an amplified (powered) HDMI splitter."
3,Splitter Decision for HDMI,"Other comments are generally spot on....I would only add that the price of HDMI switchs has dropped so low that most folks might best consider one instead of a spitter. Avoids the issues with signal loss and HDCPEspecially recommend consider the 4x1 and 4x2 switches. On the other side, if you have not yet upgraded to a HDMI based A/V receiver for your home theatre... they basically have an HDMI switch built in and aren't really expensive. You really need one anyway--eventually. Onkyo has ones with 5 to 7 HMDI input ports that aren't very spendy. I have one in use for some time now and it has proven to be very reliable at 1080P. For some reason the most recent year of Onkyo units have one less port than the year before, but you should be able to find a ""new"" one from the previous year if you need max port count and probably at a lower price also."
1,Very Disappointed,This product caused a lot of interference in my signal. It resulted in lines across the screen and a very unclear picture.
1,Don't buy it! It doesn't work!,"I bought it recently as I've two output devices and I want them display simultaneously; one is a projector, another one is a LCD TV, both are working at 1080i max. My input device is a PS3.However, this splitter is a totally failure, it didn't work any.I returned it immediately, but this sacred me how do I choose a HDMI splitter. It may not as simple as its look."
3,If your lucky this will work,"The reviews sounded like this product would do exactly what I wanted- connect 2 HDTVs to a single Dish Network DVR and view only ONE tv at a time (one in the living room and one in a bed room). Unfortunately it did work at all since my DVR and HDTVs are never completely off. Since my DVR is always connected to the TV, it wouldn't sever the HDMI connection when one tv was off and allow the other TV to connect to the DVR. So all I got were funny lines with no picture. If my DVR or TVs would shut off completely then it would have worked.So you might get lucky and this passive splitter will work for you, but if it doesn't work then it's not the fault of the splitter. I can't think of a way to test the compatibility of your TV without buying this unit and trying it, but odds are it will NOT work. Cables Unlimited should provide a list of compatible components and save everybody time and money. I recommend just buying a powered splitter like the IOGear GVS 182."
3,HDMI Splitter,"Item does work however you are forced to use both displays simultaneously. If this is your goal then this is the product for you. If you want to have the ability to use the displays individually from the same source, you won't be able to. You simply must have both units on to get an image on either screen. A bargain if this is what you want."
1,Just does not work!!!,David G is right - Amazon needs to stop carrying this item entirely. I have a TV (9 ft. cable) and a projector (25 ft. cable)connected to a home theater receiver. When only one is connected it works fine. As soon as you try to have both connected none of them work. I am just using it now to switch manually between the two (connecting only one at a time).
2,HDMI does not split,"As far as I know this product may work as advertised. However, I don't think a HDMI signal can be divided by a simple splitter such as this. At least it did not work for me in trying to split HDMI out from a cable box."
1,It just doesn't work,"Bought 2 of these, neither work. 30 ft. cable run to remote unit but base unit doesnt work either, coming off direct tv hi def box."
3,"Convenient Style, Quality is Lacking","I owned a similar style auto trash bag, and it was extremely convenient and durable. This one is made out of super-thin nylon, and I suspect it won't last a year."
3,When the HFIL???,"I'm a long time DBZ fan and I felt like this movie was inconsistant with all the DBZ movies thus far. Most DBZ films kept to the timeline of the TV series. I think the thing that bothered me the most was WHEN was this movie supposed to take place? Gohan and Vegeta are super saiyans and future Trunks is there, so it's after Cell (WHERE GOKU DIES). Goku isn't brought back to life until the Buu saga where gohans an adult, but in this film he's only a kid. Then there's the ending (energy transferance), why not just kill all bad guys that way if it's that easy"
4,One of the better DBZ movies,"I would rate this as a 4 and a half if I could. This movie has some intense moments, and seems to flow pretty smoothly. This movie is not without its flaws, however. Like other people have said, the fight at the end is anticlimatic, but it serves its purpose well.Animation: Superb. Better than almost all the other movies. (yes, I have seen them by downloading the ones not released in America) All th characters look good, and the animation for the fights is smooth and flawless.Sound: Alright, but not the best out there. I don't usually focus on the sound unless it interferes with the movie.Story: Pretty good. For once, the story is over an hour long, letting the story flow much better than the other, shorter movies.Overall: Its good. If you liked the other movies, don't hesitate to buy this one, you will probably not be disappointed."
3,it revs you up for the return,"I saw this in jap. and its just like wtching Kooler, the returns are the best but the first apperance really gets you in the feel of things. I just hope they put the rock soundtracks back from this one until the rest of the movies, because that is what really makes it completly different from watching the TV show. In japan the used the same music. Funimation did there own music for the episodes, but i guess they got tired. the movies are suposed to be movies without that little extra that was found in the soundtracks, the last 2 movies just seemed a little bland. Back to the point, its good to see and watch because it introduces you to the return , which personally is second place next to bojak in the movie series."
1,"Very bad, a dissapointment, for the fans (i'm one of them)","This movie it's just too bad, dumb plot, stone characters, no humor, no fun, no nothing, good, not even the animation!, the music it's the only good thing. period."
1,Just Say No to Pokemon,"I can't see why any animator, filmmaker, or little child could possibly respect this lame movie and cartoon series. This movie doesn't have anything that makes a movie good.Story? There is none. There is no plot, this movie consists of little creatures running around and doing mindless slapstick moves on each other.Animation? This is what really stands out as being horrendous. Dialogue consists of 2 frames of animation (one with the mouth open, one with it closed). Not that it matters, the dialogue is never in sync anyway.This is just a lame movie. It is just low quality animation, with BAD and ANNOYING acting, and a very low production value. This movie says ""I was made in a couple of weeks, for a couple of bucks.""This movie is unhealthy for impressionable youth to watch. Pretend this is the plague, and stay away."
4,A Good Film,"This was a rather good Pokémon Movie that I found enjoyable. Apparently the original version was longer, and I don't understand why there were cuts.The movie was great, a good plot, but there were some mistakes during the dubbed. I found two Pokémon errors. There was a Pidgeot called Pidgeotto, and a Scyther that was called I think an Alakazam or Kadabra.But in conclusion I think you should see this movie for yourselves to see if you like it or not. The only disappointing part of it were the cuts (I haven't seen the original version yet)."
4,Mewtwo vs. Mew,I have seen this movie several times and I must say that its one of the best Poke'mon movies made. The poke'mon are drawn well in this movie and the characters voice acting are done quite well.Overall I give this movie like a 3.5 rounded to four!
3,Wish the DVD version ...,I wish the DVD version was in letter box! I didn't get to see the movie when it was in general release. I'm sure I'm missing some action on the side (as always occurs with a movie going to the small screen).Part of the idea of DVD is widescreen. I was hoping to buy a copy but to get me to spend money means providing a widescreen version.
2,Utterly disgusted with WB,"Please listen to this view, for the uninformed who have notseen hide nor hair of the Japanese version. I really hope this isposted. Well, I rate this movie two stars. This is Japanese art. It shouldn't be spoiled by ""popular music"" and 20 minutes worth of cuts! Let's just summarize this review saying that WB took out all the emotion and excitement out of the movie and replaced it with ridiculous dialogue and mushy music. This review was written in hopes to encourage a subtitled version of this movie, to show some of us what this movie is REALLY about and correct the wrong the WB brought upon this once excellent movie."
1,A Really Bad Movie,"This was the singular most poorly made movie I have ever seen in my entire life. My younger brother wanted to go see it, and so I brought one of my friends who likes Pokemon to come and check it out with the rest of us. Before the actual movie there is a shorter one, Pikachu's Vacation, and that was alright. It did rather drag on, though, and even my friend got bored half-way through, and he's not one to have a short attention span. The actual movie, when it started, was the most sacrany, goody-goody, we-should-all-love-each-other children's flick I've ever had the misfortune to encounter. All children's movies have an undertone of such, but to come right out and preach a sermon about it as this movie did made me want to leave the theater, and I probably would have if my friend hadn't been there to make fun of it's stupidity. It does have it's audiance, which is kids up to about the age of ten, but anybody over that age will not enjoy this movie at all."
4,An Okay Movie,"I do have to admit, even though I am not ten years old I love Pokemon. I'm a big fan of anime, and I think Pokemon is a great anime series, but the series' first movie just doesn't hit a chord. First of all, Pikachu's Vacation, which plays before the movie, is the stupidest piece of Japanimation I have ever seen. This movie will definitely be a good choice to buy for any Pokemon fan, but I can really see why for non fans of Pokemon this is a hard movie to sit through. Definitely a good flick, just not one you hsould get unless your a fan of Pokemon."
3,Ok,Best pokemon movie ever but The condition wasn't great and it was worse then it was described but the disk was fine
2,Review of Meat Loaf tape,"I got the tape very quickly. Unfortunately, the tape itself is defective (skips from track 3 to 6), so that is clouding this review."
2,Turn your back and its great!,"I like everything about Paul Weller's music and the way he performs live, but his DVD has a problem I wouldn't expect from such a together performer. The editing appears to be done by a computer programmed to cut randomly to any camera every 2 or 3 seconds. Not only are they cutting fast, but they are moving in and out, up and down, so its just vertigo. I'm not the first one to mention this, but it really ruins the presentation. This is not Maroon 5 for heaven's sake. For those of us not lucky enough to be able to see Paul live, this is a major disappointment. I had to close my eyes to be able relax and enjoy the music."
3,Bansai Daniel Son!,"Arrived beautifully trimmed and in a WOW green. However, the soil was dry and these things require a lot of attention beyond your normal houseplant. Do your research before buying."
3,night cream,"This product is not all that is promised, but it's not too bad.I think it would be an ok moisturizer, but not that great as a ""wrinkle"" cream."
3,Okay moisturizer but what firming?,I've been using this for at least a month - I don't really notice any firming though it is a good moisturizer - but I could get the same results with some Avon at 1/3 the price. At least it smells good :)
4,Too Long,"Great album with too many filler songs. Dan's best song (Chelsea Hotel) is here, and so are the best versions of his other classics (Tiger Woods, One Thing Real, both of which are much lusher and fuller than they are on 50 Eggs), so it's a great CD. But this should have been pared down to one CD; if it had been, this would probably be my favorite album ever. I'd recommend New American Language for first-time Dan Bern listeners, while for everyone else this is a great investment, if too long."
5,Truth,"If you are looking for truth, in this case through art, then buy this record and listen to it regularly. On top of being spiritually enlightening it will entertain you. Not too shabby for 17 bucks. You could opt to buy a few hundred bucks worth of self-help books instead and probably walk away from reading them feeling as empty as before."
5,OH MY FREAKIN' LORD!!!,"This is an AMAZING disk!! Vin-E Dombroski who produced SPONGE took an unassuming Detroit band, and with the help of mix master Jim Ebert (Butch Walker's producer), and made new Rock gods!From first to last, this is a worthy effort and leaves me impatiently waiting for the next disc!!!Buy it, listen to it, love it!"
1,Disappointing,"Extremely disappointing. Uneven base: rocks on stove coil when just starting to boil, lid attached with what appears to be cheap paperclip hinge and lid does not ""sit"" on top of pot securely. Plastic dome clouds and wiggles around while coffee ""perks"" through the top hole and spits all over the stove and spills down pot to stove coil. Would have returned it if it didn't cost so much to do so. It went in the trash the second day."
5,A Book To Read Twice,"This book is a very good book. I really like it because it's has a compeling story that will keep you wanting to read the next line. If you are doing something important, do not start this book because you will not be ablt to put it down. This book has everything from sex, to viloence, to friendship. The gunslinger is great character, he doesn't really reveal his feelings and is trying to find the man in black. This book is really one of Stephen King's best works. If you ever want to read a good book pick the Gunslinger!"
4,Absolute Must Read,"We all know Stephen King and his works, however, this series by far is the greatest I've ever read. I cannot wait to read the next page, the next chapter, the next book. This book starts out a little difficult to follow, but stick with it. If you've ever read Tolkein's Hobbit, you will understand the need to keep reading. This is masterful and quite unlike King's absolute horror books. Keep reading."
5,Nice hooks,These are very nice hooks. They don't work for me. But it's because I have very special measurements. My pot holder rack was custom made. I haven't returned these yet as I want to ask my contractor if the narrow end can be slightly pulled apart.These are not your flimsy hooks you buy at department stores.
4,Fantastic stuff,"The musicianship really shines through on this one. Has a great balance of simple, elegant melodies and virtuoso performances. All the stars are here: Fleck, Grisman, Anger, Rice, O'Connor, etc., and their personalities really come through here."
3,Interesting Interpretation,"Having studied escatology for many years, this idea of the blooming of Eden was new to me. The writing style was a little strained. The author was jumping around and trying to cover a lot of ground: Biblical history, the occult, budding romance, adventure. On a purely literary level it was a little disjointed. However, I enjoyed the book for its alternate view of possible end-time scenarios."
2,Good Story Poorly Executed,"The storyline was good. Others have written about that. I want to comment about how badly it was written.I find it impossible to imagine that an author does not have access to a Spell Checker. What, for heaven's sake, is the ""aristocrisy""? Perhaps some form of aristocratic hypocrisy? Just one of many, many typos. Cumbersome sentences forced me to re-read paragraphs to try to understand what Mr Phillips was trying to say. I got the distinct impression that Mr Phillips was an American with stereotyped views of what English people were like. His ""Jolly Old Brit, eh, wot!"" characterisations were not at all convincing. Please, Mr Phillips, take the time to run a Spell Checker, at the very least!"
4,Great Action Comic,"If I would have known these books were so cheap online I would have been ordering them all the time. Anywayz....... I have volumes 1-5 and they are awesome!!!! I first found one of these on the bus and did some online research and found about these different series of books. I am so addictid now!<--- probably spelled that wrong. Any way, if you like kung fu movies and comics you can definately enjoy these books, because they have fantastic art which seems a lot like Jim Lee's work (artist for the Old X-Men comics and Batman currently). This story starts off with sort of a romeo and juliet type of plot and then its the typical revenge plot in kung fu stories when the son of the couple gets older and theres the typical sublots through out the story as read. The action sequences are in my opinion breath taking. The lines used to show movement perfectly portray the kung-fu in this line of comic graphic novel."
1,Get A Proofreader - PLEASE!!!!!,"This book contains a strangely large amount of typos, grammar and spelling errors, and mangled English composition. I started keeping track of all the mistakes in it for my own amusement, but soon gave up in exhaustion. There is simply no excuse for any professionally produced publication to reach the public in such a state. Whitechapel Productions, have you no shame?"
1,So disappointed.............,I bought this thing based on the majority of the reviews here. What a letdown!!!!! Certainly not to my liking and what scares?.....This is a kid's movie.
1,1 of the 8 films to die for...from laughing yourself silly!,"I can't believe some reviewers gave more than two stars for this predictable, over-wrought mess. A piano that plays ""by itself""! Rattling pipes! A hissing cat! A secondary character that seems dead but comes back to life to help in the end! Ooooooooo! Feeling the chills? Nope, me neither. The best though? A gigantic, floating skull that chases a Hummer! NOW THAT'S SCARY! Do you know how much gas one of those things consumes?!"
3,Good,Before I purchased this product I was using just plain batteries for my camera's and I was always replacing the batteries everytime I used my camera and now that I decided to purchase the rechargeable batteries I am very happy with my selection. My order was on time and everything was there. I am satisfied.
4,Beautiful History,"This book is a wonderful companion on a trip to Angkor Wat, in Cambodia. It makes excellent use of a wide variety of historical anecdotes and images to convey a sense of the feeling of rediscovery of Angkor temples in in the early 20th century.The production quality is also quite high, with glossy reproductions of color drawings of the temples. This book is not a mainly a text explanation of the temples at Angkor, nor is it a primary guide for a visit there. But with its images and written history of the temples, it describes the history of Angkor as a wonder of the world, and places the temples in the context of archaeology and travel. And it includes numerous cool little details about for the curious traveler, that more scholarly works would leave out."
4,Good service,My husband has these socks that look exactly like the picture but say INGENIOUS down them. These came and they say WigWam. Not exactly what we were hoping for but he likes them so we kept them. Service was good fast shipping
1,orthodoxy,"An evangelical with adult onset christianity, who still thinks dinosaurs were reptiles, discovers you can write a book by filling it with quotes and finds a publisher who has problems aligning his type."
4,Worth a viewing,This movie reminded me of the stupid funny of the 80's movies - a mindless good time.
4,Almost perfect,"Great fit and finish but the dust cap is plastic, which makes the whole assembly look cheap. So I just left it off my CB360 Cafe."
5,nice lock,"Nice high quality lock. Make it easy to lock up two devices, and makes me feel a lot more comfortable leaving my expensive electronics behind"
3,"Good security, locks feel a bit cheap","I recently purchased a new iMac and external hard-drive as a back up and wanted a little extra secure feeling knowing that my stuff is bolted down. This product fit well as it is a twin-lock system. The cable itself is very stiff and pulls the external over if/when I tilt the iMac. The locks don't really fit as snug as I would like, they kinda feel like they aren't on properly. The cable, however, is very long. I would recommend this product for larger, heavier items that don't move often... like for DVRs, DVD players, etc."
3,Vinnie Mac.....Master of the Bait and Switch,"I was in the mall yesterday and happened upon this DVD set. It was three discs and only $20, so I figured it was worth the cash.I brought it home and I was dismayed to find that I already had most of the matches on DVD. In some cases I have the same match on three seperate discs! Talk about a disappointment.On the plus side, the WWE is finally paying Jesse Ventura to use his commentary and Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart from Summerslam '94 is finally on disc. Orher than that though, I can't justify purchasing this dvd, even if it is for $20.If you don't have any other WWE dvds, then this is a worthwhile purchase, but I still think you'd be better off buying something from a tape trader."
5,THIS MOVIE IZ FABTASTIC,FOR ANY HORROR MOVIE FAN SATIFY YOUR CRAVING WITH WICKED LITTLE THINGS.ITS DEF A NEED TO SEE/BUY MOVIE.I COULD WATCH THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IM GOING TO ADD THIS TO MY HORROR MOVIE COLLECTION. I GIVE THIS 10 STARTS!!!
3,Movie was ok.,This movie was not the best and not the worse it worth getting and watching at lease once.
4,Pretty Good,"I just watched this movie and I must say...not bad. I liked how they looked, made it a lot scarier. Some lines were kind of cheesy but other than that, it was great. And the girl who played Sarah and played Laurie Strode in Rob Zombie's Halloween did GREAT!!!"
5,Brilliant Early Zevon,"Melodic, gritty, and smart. This album set the stage well for Warren Zevon's career. The songs are filled with brash, intelligent, and often touching lyrics rendered in that unabashedly in-your-face Warren Zevon style. This is a brilliant early album that heralded great things to come."
3,Decent Device,I bought this because I usually sleep with the tv or a radio on because of ringing in my ears. Sometimes when I am asleep I would not hear the phone ring so I got this device hoping to eliminate that problem. Almost all the time I can hear this AT&T device but on occasion I don't. The device would be much better if it had a volume control on it.
3,I miss the old intimate BEN HARPER shows!!,"I have been a huge fan of Ben Harper for a long while now. I must say that I'm not the biggest fan of his newer material. I really loved his earlier albums which in my mind were extremely unique in sound and soulfull. Even more so, I miss the way he used to sing as well. His newer recordings/performances just don't stand out. Some of the songs on this DVD seemed as though he was really trying hard. But then he sang the older songs really well. All in all, I really enjoyed his older (more acoustic) performances. This DVD was kind of a let down for me. This is just my $.2 so take it as just that. You may in fact love it."
5,to say the least..... groundbreaking,"i don't know what it is about this album really, it was the first album i heard from tom waits. found it at a used cd store, picked it up, checked it out and purchased it. put it in the cd player at home and hated its guts. left it alone for about a year, got drunk with my dad (cool guy) and started hearing it for the first time, the second time around. ive bought many tom waits albums since then and this one still manages to take me to what id be bold enough to say the essence. its deep, its dark, and most important, its felt by the man who created it."
4,"A poetic, gritty album","Much of Waits's early music could be described as ""gritty."" This is because it was hard-luck, true-to-life music about people as real as you or I, who just happened to have a narrator to tell the story of their lives. This is honest music--there aren't always happy endings, the good guys don't always when...and sometimes, there aren't any good guys at all.The X-rated rap ""Pasties & a G-String"" is alone worth the price of admission, but there are other songs that stand among the best in Waits's extensive catalogue: namely, the beautiful ""Tom Traubert's Blues,"" and the witty ""The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)"". These three songs hold up the rest of the album. Not that anything on here is bad--good heavens, no. It's all worth listening to repeatedly. I would listen to it in small doses, though--sometimes, that's the best way to take the truth."
3,uneven tom,"""Tom Traubert's Blues"" is a freaking masterpiece. Too bad nothing else on this early Waits album can match it...."
4,Fast delivery,I bought this for my wife as she had since worn out the original cassette many years ago. She is very happy with the CD that arrived sooner then we expected. It was in excellent condition and the cost was much less then she expected. We will definitely buy from seller again.
1,Kludgy Software. Poor Tech support,"My experience was similar to that of topher666. On a brand new laptop, on which the OEM DVD player ran fine, this software ran extremely slowly with no sound. Tech support was of no help. After filling out a long form on the gocyberlink website, they do not even respond directly to you. You have to login into your account to check if a response has been posted. This is anyway just a form response, to reinstall the program after first editing your registry (something most people are rightfully reluctant to do) to complete the uninstall. The form has to be filled out all over again for each follow-up. I gave up after three weeks of fruitless exchanges, after having sent at their request several diagnostic files, with not a single constructive suggestion."
5,Dead Center,This was an excellent book as is all of his books. They are so funny and great to hear what a great animal lover Andy is!! I recommend all of this books to my friends. Can't wait for the next one.
3,Not the best,"Andy goes to Wisconsin at the behest of his former(?) girlfriend Lori. A young man has been arrested for a double murder, and Lori feels he didn't do it. The dialogue in this one is not as clever as usual, and the religious sect is to stupid to be believable. A wheel dictates their lives. While this is far from my favorite book in the series, I am not going to give up on it. Hopefully the next book will take place in NJ."
4,4 1/2 Stars,"I liked this novel as much as I liked his previous novel 'Sudden Death'. It was an engaging read with a protagonist that's hard not to like, a wise-cracking Andy Carpenter. An easy and light read that's perfect for the pool.Recommended."
4,Instant Smiles,"From the cover to the very last page, I was smiling. Like other readers, this book brought back lots of memories. Even if you are from somewhere other than NY, it doesn't matter. This book is incredibly entertaining. I am not one to usually write reviews, but I just had to on this one. I hope the writers have a second book in the works!"
1,No Stars,"I'd give this book no stars if that was an option. The authors drone on and on about nothing. What is the plot, exactly? And the writing is horrendous. Not one original thought whatsoever, just a bunch of junk regurgitated back to me, cliches all over the place, and ramblings that make no sense. It was so awful I couldn't finish it. Who is giving this book 4 and 5 star reviews? The authors themselves? Friends of the authors? Glad I took this out of the library!"
1,Unrealistic all over the place,"I, like others, fell for the cute cover and the recipes, but I could not finish the book because all the characters are so unrealistic and so stupid. Save your money or buy my copy--it's for sale on half.com now."
3,Warning: Not the full album,"I love Harry Chapin and this is a great album, but be warned that this CD version is not the full album. It's missing two cuts: Love is Just Another Word, and She is Always Seventeen. I bought this to replace a cassette tape I have had forever and noticed that the number of tracks didn't match. Then I noticed a disclaimer in very small print that these two songs weren't included ""due to time restrictions."" Personally, I think this is a bit of a ripoff. To make matters even worse, neither of those songs is available as an MP3 download."
5,Summary of the Bible,"I did notice that ""The Story"" leaves out some things from the Bible. For example, when Noah sent out a dove from the ark and it brought back an olive branch, is not even mentioned. On the other hand, if ""The Story"" included every single little detail, it would be a 1000 page book like the Bible itself. This 400 page book is much more manageable. As long as you realize this is a summary, I think ""The Story"" is completely acceptable."
1,Beware,"I bought this book because I had heard a lot of good things about it. I was sorely disappointed. In the preface, it says that they've omitted portions of the Bible and that they've included ""transitions"" in italics to summarize what was left out. I'm continuously reminded of the verse in Revelations 22:18-1918 For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; 19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.In my opinion, The Story, which claims to be a Bible, is misleading, incomplete, and not the true word of God. It has been added to and taken away from, and isn't worth the money."
3,The Story,"I just have started to read this book, and although I think it is OK, I think it could have been better if all the stories in the Holy Bible were in this book. I have only gotten to page 38 and have noticed some stories missing from this version of the Bible: like what happened to Cain after he killed Abel, like the Tower of Babel, and more events that are mentioned in a normal Holy Bible and are not mentioned in this version of a Bible."
5,Wonderful and easy to read and understand,"I have always had a hard time reading the bible and have tried many different versions. Each time I always get bored or fed up with it and don't pick it up again for a long time. I just cannot get into it. Again I decided to try a new version and bought The Story. I'm so thrilled with my purchase and that they have made this book. I read it every night and find it very hard to stop reading. The bits of the bible which have not been included in the text of The Story itself are included as summary snippets in between passages, so I find I can stop at one of those each time. I am half way through it already and will be sorry when there's no more to read. Maybe I'll have to start again, or maybe I'll understand the bible better having read The Story and could make a start on that. It's a great buy and well worth the money."
3,Masque Video Slots,Only a few of the games are like they are at the casino. Most of the games on disc are boring. They are all copy cats of each other with very little difference.
4,Good Slots,This is a good selection of slot machines including video poker. I enjoy the machines that have bonus plays which are a lot of fun.
3,Not enough variety.,"I usually find Masque products pretty entertaining but I was quite disappointed in Video Slots. All the games seemed to be the same. Many of them did not explain the special combinations giving bonuses in their ""paytables"". You were left to just keep pushing the button and waiting. I do like the ability to set the payout level to regular or high."
1,Evisceration of a classic ...,"In the dozens of CHRISTMAS CAROL videos I have seen, none is as appallingly amateur as THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SCROOGE. Dickens' powerful tale is dragged through the religious mire as a company of rank amateurs fumbles through a production whose text is lifted from various film versions (which provide the only decent lines outside of poor Mr. Dickens).In one particularly reprehensible scene, in lieu of Jacob Marley's Ghost, Scrooge is visited by the voice of Jesus Christ.Tedious and preachy, offensive to the religious, non-religious, and those of even a modicom of taste, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO SCROOGE is the biggest ""Bah humbug of them all."" END"
3,Nice eye cream,I have was looking to get rid of undereye circles and they did lighten a bit. The cream worked well at moisturizing and smoothing the undereye area. It has a nice feel and smell and one tube last forever. Gives your eyes a nice bright appearance. I saw a difference in three weeks.
2,assymbly,dthe pieces did not fit together. I'm not sending it back unless I'm assured that I can get a replacement.
5,useful and fun,"This book is an invaluable resource for anyone who will be spending time in New Haven -- it lists tons of restaurants, if not every single one in the city. Not just good restaurants, but bad ones; expensive ones and cheap ones. And the authors definitely tell you what they think, absolutely trashing some restaurants, and always referring to specific dishes to let you know what was right or wrong about them.What's more, it's a really fun book to read. There are places I would never eat at, but it's fun reading about them anyway since this book is well-written and funny. I definitely recommend it."
5,Jackson Browne's Saturate Before Using,The Cd came in just a few days and was in perfect condition. Very pleased with the service.
2,Very little of real value,"Nice paper, full color printing, a catchy title ... When readers say these things it usually means there is nothing else worth raving about, and in this case they would be correct. Not a bad book at all, but not nearly as detailed or useful as ""Million Dollar Consulting"" by Weiss, a much more practical book in my opinion. I got no new ideas here and that reduced its rating from 3 to 2 stars."
5,"Easy to Read, Informative, Well-illustrated","Steve Kaplan is the nicest guy you'll ever meet, the boy every mom wishes her daughter would bring home for dinner. He could easily have been a regular on Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.So did Steve Kaplan became rich as a salesman because he was nice, or in spite of it? In this book, Steve tells you exactly how he bagged the elephants, and how you can, too. I strongly suggest you grab it now, before the first printing is all sold out and a waiting list is formed.If you're one of those people who says, ""It's worth the time spent reading and the money paid for the book if I get at least one, really useful nugget,"" then you could easily justify five or ten times the price of this book, because you're certain to find that many nuggets. Steve Kaplan was very generous in writing this book for those of us who have spent too many years chasing after mice because we were afraid of the elephants.Buy it and prosper."
5,"Wonderful Fragrance..... lives up to the ""class"" we've come to expect from Chanel.","I've never been big on names, but when I smelled Chance by Chanel I just had to have it! I received it as a gift recently and I adore the scent... it's strong, but subtle as well... I don't know why I like it, I just do. I think it triggers your senses and gives off an air of independence in some way... its hard to describe a perfume to someone so you'll just have to take a ""chance"" on it and see for yourself... But this scent has definitely earned a permanent place in my collection."
2,Sophomore Slump,"What a disappointing follow-up. The English lyrics are awful, and the singer's accent is really irritating when he sings in English as well. Much more radio-oriented and less daring and cool than the debut album. Great beats and nice instrumental licks are shed in favor of a Casio-style sound. Here's hoping for a return to their original genius on their next release. Maybe even a live album. In the meantime, I'm hoping this one will grow on me."
1,what a disappointment,"don't bother with this album. kinky's self-titled debut album is amazing. this is just a mediocre attempt at equaling their success with the first one, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a P.O.S."
2,not hard enough,this cd is ok... i like the lyrics i guess but someone being used to harder rock i just dont like this cd. the person who sings isnt all that good either.
3,Good but not great,"This movie was wayyy better than the abandoned and dark ride (those two were awful) but it was not the best of the horror fest 2006. this is a good one to watch..my father is a doctor and it is kind of fun to compare what the girl is going through with being afraid of the body, like my father was when he was in medical school."
1,can I give it zero stars please????????,"This was horrible. My God, this movie is so slow, it's like waiting for water to come to a boil. The idea of using real bodies sounded so cool. But this was a REAL stinker. Please, please, stay away from this bore. I want the 90 minutes of my life that I wasted back!!!"
2,Sooooooooooo Slow,"You need to be a fan of the hospital/cadaver type horror to enjoy this one. While there were a few decent moments of suspense, it overall moved very slowly, and provided little in the way of actual horror."
2,NO arch support,"Bought these shoes for ARCH support....there is none. Nice shoe, but if you are looking for good support...don't bother!"
3,A Little Disappointing,An Unexpected Family was not as interesting as the other books in this series. The story line was focused on Amelia too much of the time.
1,Very low quality. Beware!,"Purchased this item in May. I'm updating this review in September. Here's the life story of all 5 DL disks from this package:Disk #1: Massive CRC errors immediately after burn. Coaster.Disk #2: Massive CRC errors immediately after burn. Coaster.Disk #3: Tried to read it in June. Half of it read OK, half (2nd layer I assume) did not. Fortunately, I had a copy of all the data. Coaster.Disk #4: Tried to read it in September. DVD-Multi Drive LG-GSA4163B will not even recognize the disk. Was able to recover it in my laptop's Sony DS-D65A drive. Coaster.Disk #5: Tried to read it in September. DVD-Multi Drive LG-GSA4163B reads it fine, albeit slowly; I suspect CRC errors are mounting. Will re-record it to other disks.Bottom line: 4 very expensive coasters out of 5, and 5th seems to be going the same way. Beware!"
4,The Birth of a Enterprise,"For many people, the name W.R. Grace is connected with lawsuits and legal nightmares. But, for a true look at the birth of this amazing enterprise, one should read ""The Story of W.R.Grace"". Apart from the civil actions that Grace has confronted in the past 50 years(which you will not read about in this book), the company and its fascinating founder, William R. Grace, hold a rich history and an incredible story of rags to riches.As a young Irish boy, W.R. Grace came to America with a dream of wealth and commerce tied with a honest and sound approach to business. At a time when America's industrial revolution was booming and business pratices were not as regulated as they are today, Grace came forward with a honest and upfront approach that would change the face of America Commerce and would launch Grace into the spotlight, good and bad, for years to come. A must read for anyone in business!"
2,Lots of Average,"Lovely scenery. There is a great deal of average script to wade through between meaningful story telling moments. While I am a large fan of period pieces and BBC productions, the best scenes and acting moments can be seen on utube without spending so much time waiting for those ""moments"" of excellence in season 1 and 2.The final season is the best of the 3, but it's a long journey to season 3. Robin & Marian were a bit to sanctimonious. Knowing Marian would not be in season 3 was one of the main reasons I ventured forth."
4,Don't be mislead,"I thought I was ordering ONE PACK of 10 cassettes from Data Unlimited, for the price indicated, plus a stiff shipping and handling charge -- $13 total. What I received was a single cassette. I just want to make sure other customers are clear about this."
2,Practice Makes Perfect,DJ Venom sounds like a beginner DJ. He mostly mixes on the break. Unlike the rest of the Hard House DJ's. He mixes Hard House from beginning to end. Kinda tiring. Humpty to Irene they have skillz...if it had a little bit of Trance & some Breaks..and a good mixing...would've been a pretty good album. I'd recommend DJ Irene - Audio Underground or Richard Humpty Vission - Shut The F*ck Up & Dance! Compare to DJ Venom..mixing styles and see who is kinda behind!
4,A unique insight,"In a sea of books describing on how the PROCESS of innovation, Jeff does a good job of reminding us that without creativity, without the big idea, innovation may be possible, but it won't be very interesting. He provides a solid framework, to expalin why may organizations conforatably build systems and provide infrastructure to support innovation but do not achieve what they set out to do.. a interesting book worth a read"
5,Rockin' Wanda,"This is a fantastic CD and a must for any Rock-A-Billy fans collection. It flat Rocks!The Mean Eyed CatKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
1,No wonder she never made it big!,"These are the worst Elvis covers done in a studio I've ever heard. I think she must have paid them to record her! Try early 55-56 Elvis, Stray Cats or early Gene Vincent if you want to hear Rockabilly. In my opinion this is complete nonsense and an insult to the fans of Rockabilly! Save your money."
5,RED VISE,"I've been using Wilton Vises at work for years so I've seen the quility first hand. I've shopped this vice out pretty hard, and came to the conclusion that Amazon was the cheapest and best option for purchasing it, based on years of great Amazon service. Plus its free shipping! As expected the vice is in great working order and look forward to yrs of use. Great Vice at a Great Deal!"
3,Need a 1996 Metro Manual - 4 Cyl.,"I am looking for help in finding a repair manual for my 1996 Geo Metro. It's 4 cylinders, automatic transmission, 2 door hatchback. The newest year I've found is 1994 but these only cover cars with 3 cylinders. Can anyone help ??"
5,Lordie Lordie!,"From the moment I picked up this book, I knew that I was in for a rich and detailed world filled with love and lust. The historical world Kalen Hughes creates for us is one many historical writers have a tendency to gloss over. Lord Sin has amazing depth and intelligence all around. Her characters are beautifully flawed, which sets up for a realistic, hot story I didn't want to put down. Wonderful, wonderful debut!"
5,Prisoner in Disguise,"This was the first Linda Ronstadt album I ever heard back in late 1970. I had never quite heard anything so pure and wondrous as this voice and to this day wonder if I will ever hear any one sing like her again. Perhaps Trisha Yearwood is a close second these days.This album contains such classic tracks as Love is a Rose, Prisoner in Disguise and Silverblue. The arrangements are fabulous. There are many different styles tackled but the album has a wonderful flow.It is so exciting to be able to have this album on CD as my old vinyl was well and truly worn out. Even today this album stands up - my 18 year old son commented 'wow who's that singing!'. He was hearing the voice of an angel that can still move people 30 years on! Thankyou Amazon for bringing this CD to my attention."
4,The sweetest gift,I bought this CD for the duet with Emmie Lou Harris of The Sweetest Gift and they do a very good job.
2,Staled Out,"Let's be HONEST, REALISTIC and downright to the point! Patty needs to be shaken, awakened and have a fire lit under her...! She's been recording and shelling out the SAME schmaltzy formulaic noise for a decade! TIME she ROCKS the turf! I've been a loyal Patty Loveless cd buying fan since 1987. If she doesn't shake things up soon, I won't be buying anymore of her stuff, period! It's obvious - from record sales & chart status - that many other fans stopped supporting her already...Patty, You're slipping fast!"
4,pure patty and that's good,"finally got this copy, I love the style of this CD, how it sheds some of the recording frills and stays to basics, which if anyone has her Mountain Soul CD, you know its what she does best. The added bonus of the DVD, is nice as well with some good clips from Austin City Limits, and a music video or two, all in all very good."
5,totally charming!,"I was house-sitting years ago and the people had a copy. Had never heard of it but will always be grateful I watched it! It has become one of my all time favorites. simple, sweet, with a great message.I keep watching to see if it comes out on DVD and guard my VHS tape carefully!"
4,A journey thru time,"John Douglas' The Armenians is not an easy read with complex or unfamiliar names and places. But it is engrossing and hard to put down. As a married-to Armenian wife, I have struggled to understand the family history. This book helped me to establish in my mind the journey taken by grandparents-in-law in the early 20th century as they left their beloved homeland to begin life again in the US."
5,AMAZING WISH I COULD GIVE IT 10 STARS,"I love to read and sharing an amazing book like this with others is a joy. Rating works of art (books) is not a love of mine simply because each reader's experience with a book differs due to our life's interjected- perceptions. They say perceptions are everything. Right? So I say go in with no expectations- live with the characters- accept the journey for what it is and the book will take you where you are to ""travel"". Enjoy your reading!!! This is a lovely story...curl up and read away."
3,"Just okay, boring at times","This book is just okay. It isn't a bad story; it's just boring. I stuck with the book until I had about 50 pages left, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I read the last few pages to find out what happened and my overall reaction was, ""Ehh."" It just wasn't compelling or engaging to me. If you want to read a time-traveling love story, read the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon. Great books!"
2,"Distasteful characters, distasteful story","Gave this a couple stars for sheer creativity and an interestsing concept, butI almost didn't make it through this book as I felt it was incredibly stupid. I'm not a fan of science fiction, but love a good love story -- and this wasn't it. Henry and Claire had little chemistry for me and they both seemed more like sex partners than true lovers. All kinds of details were mishmashed together illogically. The scene in Gomez's kitchen at the very end was the epitome of ridiculous and only reinforced for me the idiocy of these characters."
5,Cinematic,"I loved this book. It has incredible scope and flow. As I read it, the movie unfolded in my mind. I only hope that it isn't ruined when it is finally made into a film."
1,UGH.,"Somehow it just didn't grab me. I might be a wonderful book for someone, but not me. Older guy visiting young girl. It creeped me out. Couldn't finish and after first chapter never pick it up again."
1,I've got better things to do.,I've got better things to do than read this trash. It's a lovely tale about a couple who can't achieve anything past a good night of sex in their relationship. Boring! If I wanted to read a romance novel I'd have picked something a bit more entertaining than this.
2,Well written - no moral sense - sex isn't always romantic,"Sadly I was unable to read this book through. The writing style was good and I found the premise attractive. I even liked the setup at the start of the novel, but before you even get to chapter two you have an out-of-wedlock sex scene (granted it isn't as bad as the average modern romantic novel, but still unacceptable for a practicing Christian). Why should we think it's romantic when Henry takes Clare home, having just met her, and fornicates with her? He's just getting what he can while he can. I flipped through the novel and easily found more of that type of content. If authors can actually convey a sense of romance between two people, why do they need tittilation to keep people's interest."
2,Couldn't relate to the book,"I love science fiction and fantasy, but I'm picky about what I read. Even so, I can count on one hand the books that I've never been able to finish. This book is one of them.The reviews I read here made me look forward to seeing what this author had to share. After 2/3 of the book I got sick of the disfunctional characters and their sorry lives.The main concept is interesting, and the journal like presentation gives the book a nice style. Unfortunately, the male hero of the story is portrayed as such a jerk that I was never able to understand or care about him.While I can see that the author is trying to show us a couples struggles in life, I got so tired of reading about the guys sex life that I couldn't hang on for any future emotional payoff.In short, it's a guy you don't care about who is stuck in a fantastic yet depressing (and sometimes creepy) relationship. Major downer."
1,i wish i would have known,"this story is polluted with cursing and crude gratuitous sexual content.there is no real plot line to this book, you can turn to any page and follow the story as well as if you read it in chronological page order.there is nothing to keep me reading. i felt no pull to know more about the characters or what they were experiencing. the story was told and not felt.the narration is poor. the story is told in first person from the views of clare and henry, neither of which has a voice of their own. on several occasions i had to look back to see which one of them was speaking.i feel like the characters were shallow with nothing but sex driving their love or lives.overall i am disappointed and left this book feeling dirty."
2,Don't believe the hype ...,Was hoping for a romantic time travel story. Plenty of time travel but no romance. The characters had no depth and the writing did not convey any passion between these two. The underdeveloped characters are the fatal flaw in what otherwise may have been a great book.
2,more of a lust story than a love story,"While I really liked the whole time-travel, meeting your spouse ahead of time, etc. story line, and the way the author presented it, a major problem for me was that this book came off as more of a lust story instead of a love story. The author's overuse of the f- word was what did this for me. The time traveler and his wife didn't make love, they f-----. Both characters continually referred to it in those terms both after the fact and in asking each other for it. ""Why don't you f--- me"", ""please f---"" me"", ""let's f---"", over and over. The overuse of such crude/juvenile terminology for what should have been beautiful moments in this couple's life ruined the relationship of the two and the entire book for me."
3,Disappointed,"Being a fan of time travel movies and stories, I thought this book would have been a real page turner. Quite frankly, I forced myself to finish it. I honestly don't understand the hoopla this book as gotten. I'd see the movie just out of curiosity. How are they pulling this off in a movie??? You want to see real time travel? Rent yourself the movie ""Somewhere in Time"" (with Jane Seymour & Christopher Reeves). Now THAT was a great time-travel story, and I guarantee you'll agree. Even Back to the Future in the 80's with Michael J. Fox was better time-travel entertainment! Sorry!"
5,I want a time traveler of my own,"I loved this book! It ranks as one of the best books I've ever read. I just loved that there was nothing predictable about the story, it always kept me interested and on my toes. This wonderful book goes on my relatively short list of books I would read again and again. MAGNIFICENT!!!"
3,Better than the movie...,I enjoyed the book but found towards the end I was wondering if I would ever finish...it was a little long and drawn out for me. I am glad I read it before watching the movie or I am sure the movie would have been a little difficult to follow.
5,Engrossed by the prologue,"I bought this book on vacation because I wanted some light reading and because my husband has something in common with the time traveler (both librarians). I had no idea that I would become so engrossed.I knew from the first 10 pages that the book would be tragic. I fought the opposing needs to both read the book as quickly as I could to find out what happens, but also trying to go slowly so to avoid the inevitable. I wept aloud for the last several hours of the book, and that is not a common occurrence.I absolutely loved this book. I dreamt about it, I told my friends about it, I appreciate the little things about my marriage so much more because of it.I want to read it again to see what I didn't pick up on the first time through, but I'm not ready yet.This is an amazing love story and does not come across as sci-fi. Very highly recommended."
2,"Good premise, verbose execution","At first this book was a real page-turner. The premise is preposterous but one can easily accept it as the driver for an interesting and innovative story. And it could have been such a novel, if it was 300 pages shorter. In reality, the relentless pretentiousness and verbosity of the prose gradually wore me down. Endless descriptions of the protagonist's daily lives, laced with a comical amount of literary, artistic and musical name-dropping mentioned by other reviewers.It's the archetypal first novel, and for all that, is a decent effort, but it needs an awful lot of editing.I made it to page 337 before I gave up and read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia."
2,Disappointing,"The main points that bothered me about this book were the forced profanity as well as the sexuality between a child and grown man. The crude language spoken by both Claire and Henry made these characters less believable to me. It didn't jive with the character development. Claire using the 'c' word regularly and both Claire and Henry throwing around the 'f' word caused me a great deal of discomfort. It added to my feeling of dislike for the whole bunch of them. Secondly, the sexuality developing between Henry as a 40 year old man and Claire as a child was plain wrong.I loved the idea of time travel and thought about what it would be like to meet 'myself' as a teen. Neat thought, thus the 2 stars."
3,Travel and Sex,"This book is fascinating because the idea is incredibly cleverHenry is the time traveler, and the trouble is, he disappears from one period of time to another and takes nothing with him, so he is always trying to find clothing first off when he arrives in the next time.Clare met him long ago when he was thirty-six and she just six. Eventually they meet in real time. In real time they are only eight years apart.Audrey Niffenegger makes this book interesting with the details she adds when they play pool; when Clare works on her paper art, Niffenegger adds the details, talking with a doctor about DNA, again the details are there.I really love every aspect of it EXCEPT the characters are flat. There is nothing to Clare and Henry's relationship except sex and time travel."
3,Overall decent read,I was suprised when reading this book considering all the great reviews I read and heard. It didnt turn out to be the page turner I expected it to be however I did finish it within a few days so it was enough to have me return.The book was a bit slow at times and didnt really make for an intersting story.
1,Emotional blackmail,"I actually reviewed this book early on, negatively, which was not well received. I erased it. Now with thousands of reviews this is probably a moot point, but I get my say. It took me a long while trying to figure out why I was so negative about this story. I've come to the conclusion that it is emotional blackmail. Some people get their jollies by extreme sports, jumping out of airplanes or bungee jumping off bridges. This novel is kind of like that. The author jacks you around emotionally. It's intentionally manipulative, and that makes me angry. The thing is, it's a huge book and represents an investment in time. I expect some return on that investment, but what I got out of this was a depressing sadness. If you enjoy being made to cry, this is for you, but if you believe you have a right to pursue happiness, don't detour down this road. It just isn't necessary."
2,"dull, dull, dull","I expected more, after hearing so many people say they had really enjoyed this book. I found it to be dull and weak. I guess if I had related at all to either main character, I might have been more into it. But as it was, I just didn't care enough and I didn't buy this lifelong love affair. By the end, I was ready for it to be over. And I hate to say this, being a woman and all, but the writing is unbearably feminine."
2,Time Travel Should Have Been More Believable.,"There are many scientific hypotheses dealing with the manipulation of time. However, the ""Chrono Displacement Disorder"" invented by the author is too infantile for romantic and sci-fi readers to accept.The story could have been more ""realistic"" had the author employed other forms of time management. Perhaps the teleportation of body and soul as claimed by spiritualistic mediums worldwide would have made much more sense to those who read to transport themselves into new dimensions.Andrew J. RodriguezAuthor: ""The Teleportation of an American Teenager"""
3,Tooooo Looong,"Altough I have read many many books in my life I sometimes get tired of the way writers keep going leaving behind readers and their patience. Case in question is this work of fiction that has a perfect premise and it develops it in the first 300 pages and then you need to read 500 more out of nothing. Good book, good premise, good writer, long work, where was the editor? so if you are retired or a leftover of the nineteen century this will be your book."
2,offensively poor writing,"I was embarrassed when this book arrived and I realized that I had just purchased a dressed up romance novel. The premise sounded great, but it is only a front. Niffenegger is painfully self indulgent. This would be great as a guilty pleasure for someone who can stomach it, but the write-ups are misleading."
5,"Some of you just didn't ""get"" it","To all the people who read this book and didn't ""get into"" it. YOU SIMPLY MISSED THE POINT. After everthing is said and done it's a love story plain and simple. The ancillary happenings in the book are simply backround noise for the love between Harry and Clare. Would you wade through everything they went through and still continue to love? Love isn't easy, it's a struggle that last a lifetime or almost two as this book goes. The final chapter that has Harry popping in on Clare....well I don't want to ruin it. Truly heartbreaking. It is quite possibly the saddest book I've ever read.If you want ""literature"", read ""A Tale of Two Cities"" or ""War and Peace"" If you want a good, no a great book, that deals with the stamina of TRUE love. Pick this book up and give it a chance."
1,Something must be wrong with me...,"I finished this book last night, almost racing to the end wanting so much for it to be great. Not so. I picked this book up mainly because the reviews were so great here. I tried to keep an open mind, but it was just too confusing for me, particularly the way that Henry dies...or did he?? I would love to say that I loved this book, but in reality I wish that I could go back in time and not buy it in the first place. A better book, in my opinion, would be ""Middlesex"" by Jeffrey Eugenides -- where you go back and forth in time and it makes sense."
1,Ugh...hated this overhyped book...skip it. .,"I tried, honestly I did to like this book but the story is boring and repititious and goes nowhere. I know I'm in a minority but, if you like books that have plot, skip this one. Sorry. There must be someone out there who feels as I do."
4,Well worth the read,"I really enjoyed this book. It is well writen and the timeline is easy to follow. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I am interested. This book was funny, sad, sweet, and interesting. Even though the outcome was apparent, the journey was not transparent. I really liked this one!"
3,It was good.,"Every time I Google this book I see hundreds of raving reviews. I just don't feel it. It IS a good love story that involves time travel in a unique way but it's a little redundant, way to long and just lacking something. Halfway through I felt like ""I get it he can travel in time already!!""It's not a terrible book but it's not the best book I've read this year it's average. I seen it's being paired with The Kite Runner and to be honest I much preferred that.I did really like all the music, as a huge fan of the Violent Femmes it was cool to see their songs throughout and I did like the cover.Danielle Millar, Glenn Simon Inc."
4,Beautiful Love Story,"The movie was almost the perfect translation of the characters from the book ,but they did leave some of them out.The choice of actor's to play Clare and Henry were perfect. Lot's of chemistry between them, very believable. This is oneof my favorite books about love and time travel. It is a lengthy book at 500 and some pages, but is an easy read. Received thebook whithin days of ordering it and was priced just right."
1,Horrible book. Save your money,Just pure hype. Life is too short to waste on such a piece of garbage.
1,The Time Traveler's Wife,"This book was very confusing. It goes from 1991 to 1968 to 1988 so on and so forth. I couldn't make sense of it.The story is about Henry DeTamble. He has Chrono-Displacement Disorder. It causes his genetic clock to reset. ""He finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity from his life, past and future."" He'll just disappear without warning.Then, there's Clare. She's met the future Henry in her past and he told her that they would be married.They meet again in 1991. Henry is 28 and Clare is 20. They fall in love.And then we go back and forth in time until nothing makes sense.Don't read this book. It's a waste of your time."
1,Just couldn't get into it!,"So many people I know read this book and said they liked it so much so I thought I would too. I tried to read it before the film was released but I just couldn't get into it. The characters were just not that interesting and I really didn't care about their lives and what this time traveling guy was up to. I never got past the second chapter.I'm sorry I actually bought it (good thing I didn't get the hardcover edition) and now it'll sit on my bookself until I donate it to my local library bookstore.As far as ""time travel"" books, The Outlander series is by far much better and IMO, nothing compares to those books."
3,Enjoyable read,"The plot and the premise of the story rely entirely on one interesting concept, and it becomes a bit repetitious and tiresome after a while. Niffenegger's writing is fluid but a bit bland. The two main characters are not particularly likable either; they sounded snobbish and pretentious, yet their lives are really quite boring other than the fact that Henry time travels. The graphic descriptions of their ""love making"" did not help to make them more interesting unfortunately.Nevertheless, there are enough suspense and interesting things in the story that keep me flipping to the next page. It is a nice and extraordinary love story after all. I also enjoyed the ending which is melancholy yet effective.This book is an enjoyable read."
2,Not a good book for kids,This was an ok book! a little to much of the physicalrelation ship though!!! the story and the plot are great but ididn't really like that they were describing their sex alongwith the book. that is a thing that should have been not sofocused on. if you don't mind that trash though you will like the book.
5,Awesome book!,"This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is now one of my favorite books of all time."
2,This book should time travel somewhere else,"This book was recommended to me by numerous people on an AOL book message board. They all pronounced it ""fantastic""! Is it because I really don't understand time travel? Or was it because I couldn't sit down and read it all at one sitting? Maybe it would've made more sense then. But the constant going back and forth between time periods and a character talking to themselves in a different time just didn't make sense to me. And I didn't think the ""romance"" that it was sort of wrapped around was anything to write home to mom about either. Maybe I just don't ""get"" time travel. I think I'll stick with Jodi Picoult!"
2,no depth,"This is one of those books you try to finish because of good reviews but in the end you wonder why they got such good reviews. Too simplistic, no depth at all. The story itself is not intense enough to keep the reader focused. I lost interest after reading 1/3 of the book."
3,Maybe I just don't get it,"I see that this book got a lot of good reviews, but personally I found it to be a real disapointment. I thought it was over emotional, and some of the plot points really bugged me. For example, why on earth would Claire insist on having a baby when that baby could end of time traveling. And then what ever happened to the poor kid? And was it really necessary for Henry's mother to die in such a bizarre way? I found myself getting more and more annoyed with this book because I felt there was some emotional manipulation involved that I didnt appreciate."
2,Very disappointing read,"When I began reading this book, I absolutely loved it. It is a very interesting story, and has very beautiful writing. I enjoyed it right up until the Henry met Clare for the first time. From that point on, the story became increasingly pretentious and unbelievable. But my biggest disappointment was the jarring language and constant sex. Niffenegger has real talent, and it is disappointing that she wastes it turning a potentially classic book into a cheap sex novel."
2,"close , but no cigar","What promises to be a highly original novel soon turns out to be nothing more than just another love story. Sure , the love between the two main characters is complicated by the fact that one of them suffers from Chrono Displacement Disorder (He is epileptically transported to the past or future , against his will) but this original idea is not fully exploited and worse , ends up in Contradiction City. Add to this the fact that Niffenegger's writing skills are mediocre to say the least (someone must have convinced her that she could do anything) and you are left with just another movie script."
1,Disappointment,"I bought the book because of the early reviews and the fact it was on the bestseller list. It turned out to be one of the few books I never finished reading because I thought it was horrible. Very confusing and not at all what I expected. The time traveling was hard to follow, especially when Henry runs into himself at an earlier age and the earlier self also time traveled to that moment. I then decided to watch the movie first to make reading the book easier. Well, I found the movie was just as bad, so I gave up on the book."
5,A keeper,"Like most time-travel stories, this is a meditation on destiny and free will, with a plot driven by paradox dilemmas. I've rarely read such a fresh and moving treatment, however. The author wisely avoids too much investigation into the explanation for the time travel and concentrates instead on the impact on lives and characters; it's not science fiction but a traditional novel. I found this a very, very appealing book. I'm looking forward to the movie."
4,Great Story!,A story about love and the different ways love often binds us to someone we love. I loved the character development. The main characters were flawed and realistic which is especially important with this type of fiction book. Unpredictable story line keeps you reading until the very end. Very enjoyable and makes you think abstractly!!
2,"Technically brilliant, otherwise a yawn","I really labored to get through this book. While the author does an outstanding job of weaving the details of past and present events as the characters transition from one time to another, the story itself is not very compelling. It is also somewhat tiresome to continue keeping track of who's speaking (Henry or Clare), and who's what age. As other reviewers have said, the character development is weak, and it's not easy to develop a lot of empathy for either of them. I mostly hung with this book and finished it so I could guilt-free write a review here, and warn other would-be readers to avoid this popular novel. There are so many better books out there so spend your time on."
1,I don't get it,"It took a lot of pages to tell a relatively thin story. I found the characters a bit unbelievable. I would have liked some evidence as to why they loved each other so deeply rather than just a repetition of the fact that they did. And, as a librarian, I found Henry totally unbelievable. It felt a bit like a harlequin romance with time travel as the twist."
3,Request for Kindle Version,Why is it not available on Kindle? will this ever change? Request ... please make this book available on Kindle.
3,Almost Fabulous,"This book had me at the beginning and then got even better. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but near the end there is a scene that made me hate Clare and another character. Both of whom I had grown to love. And it was done in a gratuitous fashion and was completely unnecessary to the story. Except for characters acting out of character I loved the book, but my lasting memory is one small part that ruined an otherwise great book."
2,A Soap Opera of a Novel,"Yawn!!!!What do others see in this book! It is dull trudge full of the usual grab bag of devices that supposely make a book interesting. If you are looking for a mindless read, this fits well. Don't expect to be challenged!"
2,Boring- flat and lacks depth,"I thought it was me, the reviews that first showed up when I bought the book glowed. Every friend thought it ""one of the best"". I cared so little about the story or the characters that I just stopped reading it 3/4 of the way through. Then I looked at all 800+ reviews and saw that to my surprise many people thought it less than a bearable read. I cannot help but wonder why these reviews did not present themselves before I wasted my money and time on this trivia."
2,One-dimensional,"After hearing rave reviews from my coworkers, I decided to give this ""new, up and coming"" author's debut a read. It was a disappointment.The author fails to logically address the awkwardness and distastefulness of a six-year old girl meeting her future husband, and vice versa. Although the audience knows from the start that they are to be lovers ultimately, no concrete reasons are given as to what exactly makes Clare and Henry fall in love with each other. The love story is simply too one-dimensional, and full of sex, more than anything else.It's a popular theme, but could have been much more interesting. Spend your money on something else."
1,Full of holes and unsatisfying,"Of course, from the very title you know not to expect a believeable story, but this author does not even try to bridge the believable gap of the unbelievable.I doubt the author is a woman. It reads like it's written by a man--despite the mushy love story. The author uses crude language when it's not necessary and has the main character sleep with another man (twice) when she is most likely not to do so - unless written by a man.To top it off, the ending is decididely unsatisfying."
1,The TIme Traveler's Wife,"It was an okay book, but way too long....she added so much fluff--typical first time author. Great premise and ending, but I was skimming through many many sections."
4,The Time Traveler's Wife,"The Time Traveler's Wife, By Audrey Niffenegger was a book that I had not initially intended reading, but became curious about due to the conversations others were having. I had mixed opinions about this book at first because I really struggled to become invested in the plot and characters for the first half, but then absolutely loved the second half so I am glad I persevered! Overall, a beautiful love story with a unique time travel/sci-fi twist which will ultimately tug at your heart."
3,Its only okay,"The plot for this novel is interesting and it is a page turner. However, the characters are not very likeable, and the writing style is pretty average. This is not literature by any means, but a good summer read. Don't think too hard about the plot or else you'll really think this was a horrible book. Just accept what the author says as fact."
4,Restores your faith in book club books,"I don't trust bestsellers that became that way by being promoted on a TV book club. I've had my fair share of Oprah Book Club selections that were so dull I wondered how many of those that actually purchased them on her advice actually waded all the way through them. This one is a Today Show selection --- which made me skeptical about the good reviews from the start. I read books by the bag full --- and this is one of the best I've read this year! It's a love story with enough intrigue to keep the pages turning as fast as any thriller. It's a book that will make you laugh, cry and wonder --- and stick with you long after the last page is turned."
3,"Book-Blooging this, anyone care to join?","I just bought the book and started reading today. For some reason I started a blog on it, there were just so many thoughts going through my head while reading...Attention! I saw the film first, so I take knowledge of it, i.e. the story/the ending, for granted!Anyone care to join me? I just finished chapter 1.[....]"
4,Up there with the best!,"Successfully employing the much exhausted subject of time-travel, this stunning debut novel from Audrey Niffenegger contains a poignant, thought-provoking story that is definitely hard to forget. While evoking the more classical aspects of love and good story-telling, Audrey Niffenegger manages to tie in the modernity of the main world the protagonists live in, creating a balance between the old and new, as well as the beautiful and vulgar. It is fairly difficult to find a boring part within the book as it flows superbly, despite the sudden flashes of time travel littered throughout it, and uses every technique possible to endear itself to almost every age group.A recommended read for a rainy day and the perfect companion to a steaming mug of hot chocolate."
3,Really a Romance,"The title of this book is both accurate and deceptive.""Accurate"" because it really does tell the story of a woman who's life is profoundly changed from age six by visits from her future husband. She met him for the first time when she was six, and he met her for the first time when he was 28. The story develops in a shakily linear fashion, with overlapping and flashbacks from other events. It makes the tale a bit difficult to follow, but is also what makes it unique.""Deceptive"" because the title makes one believe that this is a work of Science Fiction. Certainly it must be a form of Speculative Fiction, but in truth the element of time travel is merely a device to create an unusual story. Philosophy -- in the form of free will vs. determinism -- is involved as well, but the central theme of the story is the love shared between a man and a woman.This is a well-written romantic novel, a solid ""three stars."""
2,Too Much,"I enjoyed the book, except and this is a big exception , there was way too much sex. It wasn't needed that graphically. In the book the main character needed to have sex to not time travel. I'm sure the author could have found something else, or if not, she could have made it less graphic. I was hoping to share this with my book club, but now I know not to recommend it."
3,Good Book,"This was a good book, but it was a little slow at parts and a little drawn out. I LOVE to read and enjoy a long book if it keeps me reading, I love a good page turner. But for me this wasn't a page turner through the whole book and I found myself skimming parts and skipping pages just to get to something interesting. But over all it is a pretty good book."
4,illogically realistic,"this is not a science-fiction book, even though the title might suggest so (just in case the 1-star comment should scare you). in fact, in order to truly enjoy it, you have to abandon logic. once you do, it becomes one of the most heart-wrenching, realistic love stories you'll ever read: i've seldom been able to relate as with this book. minus one star for requiring a blind eye."
1,Not much on Time Traveling,The book was basically flat regarding interesting time traveling. There was never any really reason as to why he time traveled and the wife was surely a misfit. The characters were poorly described and just as poorly developed so that there was never any real mystery except to say why did the author attempt such a story not knowing much about time traveling or reasoning for time traveling.The ending left you very dissapointed for wasting valuable time reading this book.
4,WORTHWHILE,This book feels a little like slogging through at the beginning- but it feels worth it as the book eventually picks up speed. The characters feel real and the author grows on you. Am waiting to finish before I see the movie.
2,Hard to finish,"Other reviews summarize the plot so I won't repeat everything here. Essentially, this is a story about a time travelling man and the various people in his life and how he comes in and goes out of ""meeting"" with them - at least that's how I felt about it. I kept reading it to see how everything would end but even that was disappointing. At times, the story and characters were really annoying. Yet when I gave this to a friend, she loved it! So much for opinions!"
5,Amazing,"This is the best book that I have read in a long time. I was intrigued by and committed to this novel by the time I got to the end of the summary, but it turned out to be so much more than I expected. The characters are real, not perfect, not heroes, and at times not someone that you would want to associate with. However, their struggles and triumphs are something that so many people can relate to. The time travel aspect adds a little extra twist to the novel, but mostly it's a story about life, love, and growing as a person."
4,enjoyable,I have to agree with the gratuitous sex comment that another reviewer has mentioned. It is sex addiction. If I sort of try to block it out I enjoy the narrative for the aspect of Henry and Clare as a team in their marriage. They have interesting conversations and I love how literate that they both are.
2,Random?,"Great title, gifted writer, great concept - but somehow so depressing. Every time I read a chapter, I just felt wiped out afterwards. It had me in the beginning, but the page count could have been cut in half overall without losing any essentials. The plot was very creative in parts, but overall felt patternless. The ending didn't satisfy or make much sense - why did he visit her one last time at an old age? Was it symbolic (a resurrection of sorts), or a subconscious nod to the (admittedly tearjerking) end of ""Forever Young?"" A more logical ending would be him perpetually re-visiting her at age 18 when they got to have sex for the first time. (Not that I totally dug that scene, either - it lacked soul and beauty.)Maybe I'm just weary of the ""intelligent people write dark books"" box, but there seems to be something Emperor's New Clothes-ish about all the raves here."
5,Excellent,"A remarkable book that truly wraps you up in the idea of time travel. I found myself utterly believing Neffenegger's plot, and absolutely loving her characters."
5,You will fall in love with this book!,"I am usually very critical on books. But this book is such as exemption!!! Very well written, it will make you fall in love with the characters.It is that type of book that will ""hunt"" you for a long time. You know what I am talking about, don't you? While reading it, it will be hard for you to think about anything else. After reading it, you will wish that all your friends would read it too, so you can talk about the book...This is the story of a man who has a desease that makes him travel in time, like the title suggests. Throughout his life he meets people, makes friends, gets married... But not exactly within the pre-established order that a normal life follows. His curse is the lack of control he has.Even with this lack of control, he lives a passionate life, taking with him the lives of people who loved him."
4,The honeymoon is over... before it's even begun.,"Easy and enjoyable to read and the author did a laudable job of structuring what might have been a very confusing story. Even though the characters were completely banal and unengaging I wanted to know what happened to them. Soon I realised that I could not enjoy this book as the sweet and quirky romance it had been marketed as. I could only enjoy it as a macabre examination of intimate relationships, seasoned by the horror of inevitible decline. The ending, right down to the last paragraph, is particarly ghastly. I am completely undecided as to whether A. Niffenegger is cheap writer with the convenient ability to pull heartstrings or a good storyteller with the ability to expose the dark void at the core of the American Dream."
3,tragic and depressing,"Although it contains all the things needed for a great book-well written, an interesting story, and likable characters,it was extremely disapoointing. It did not live up to the hype. Extremely tragic from beginning to end."
5,Extraordinary,"This is a book that will wrap itself around your heart once you are established in the rhythm of ""time travel."" I originally rejected it because of the sci-fi angle, but realized once I had begun reading it, that the time travel is a necessary adjunct to the love story of two exceptional people. The intensity and depth of their feelings for each other would not, I believe, have been there without the concept. Audrey Niffenegger is a consummate writer who succeeds in combining two or three disparate themes in one truly outstanding novel."
2,Like reading an internet chat room,"I confess -- I bought this book for the intriguing title and well written first page.NOT FOR ME. It's all written in first person from the point of view of both characters (which kills any suspense), and you have to wade through it to find anything resembling a plot. You would have to pay me to wade through the whole thing.It reads exactly like an internet chat room -- on and on and on about what?Give me a book with a plot and some suspense anyday."
2,Slightly below average,"I was disappointed after reading this book. While it did keep my attention, I was unmoved by the love story. The method of story telling was unique, but ineffective in the end. In addition, I found that the use of vulgar language was totally unneccessary - not a book for children of any age."
1,Trite as shite,"Niffenegger is a broken woman. Some man, somewhere, broke her heart and so, as artists are apt to do, she used that pain to create this novel. Unfortunately, she used it to create Henry, an idealistically perfect and laughably implausible man. He's witty and devoted and handsome and says the perfectly scripted things at the perfectly scripted time, and he cleans up well and is well-read. Oh, but he is an alcoholic, which, strangely, hardly seems to be a problem for anyone. Garbage.He has no depth; his love, Clare, has no depth. They sit in their home with their angsty time-travelling problem, being hip and so beautiful, and nobody ever says anything REAL. I felt like I was watching Dawson's Creek. I'm sure Niffenegger is a lovely woman, and I'm sad that she was slighted somehow, but she is a poor, poor writer. This book is trite. Not one character rings true. Not one."
1,Oh please,Go to Einstien's Theory of Relativity. It's just better thought out and easier to understand. Time travelers cant change events says the author. So how did he win the lottery???? Oh please. Dumb book.
5,"One of my favorite novels, if not my favorite","I didn't know what to expect when I bought it, but you have to know that from beginning to end (all 560 pages of it), it never let me down. It has adventure, action, comedy and drama. In some parts I even cried. What I'm hoping is that author will write a new novel that will fulfill my expectations as much as the Time Traveler's Wife did. I am really excited to read her next work. I highly recommend it for anyone who just wants to escape reality and live someone else's."
5,The Charecters Remain With You,"""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is about longing and idenity and love and I did not want it to end."
2,Pathetic ending,"I will agree that the bulk of this novel was an engrossing page turner, however the ending was pathetic. Clare seemed like a strong character and then she just lost her backbone. Niffenegger handled the time shifts reasonably well, though she never does adequately explain the final tragedy. I found Henry's attraction to Clare as a teenager, and vice versa, to be a bit creepy. I also don't understand how this guy could keep a job when he's always disappearing, leaving behind his clothing and reappearing naked. If you are an observant reader, the obvious flaws will bother you."
5,A stunning accomplishment,"What an amazing novel. Touching, funny, tender and unusual, it is steeped in relationships of all ilks, and manages to explore the issues of chronic illness and fear in a manner that is neither a downer nor scary. A true 21st century gem that will be enjoyed all the more by those who live in, have lived in, or are fond of, Chicago -- where much of the book is set."
3,Good but limited,"This game is good for the price---the first 3 games are good for beginners, the last 3 are a little more challenging. The games aren't real exciting, but good enough."
2,Impossible to open,"This game is great for teaching notes and chords, but once the download is complete, it is impossible to open and play the game. It takes longer to figure out how you wound up getting it open than is worth the aggravation.Music Games (Jewel Case)"
1,One of the worst!,This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. It's hard to know where to begin a critique.The plot is outlandish. The theology stinks. The characters are shallow. The writing is banal. I patiently plowed through about 100 pages of this drivel and gave up.WHen will Christian publishing houses raise their standards? I find it difficult to believe that this author has sold so many books! Perhaps I should ask: When will Christians raise their standards for reading material?
4,Computerwelt is way better.,"This is a perfect album in almost every sense; production, composition, performance, concept, etc.It's only drawback is that this is the English version. The lyrics in ""Computer World"" have been edited and they have no real meaning nor sense anymore. This is why I give it 4 stars.The German version has more sound channels, more lyrics and more overall meaning.You'll notice the differences as soon as you get to compare them.Of course, if you prefer this version, it's just a matter of choice. In the end, this is what this world is all about, right?"
4,VERY DREAMY,THIS CD MAKES YOU THINK OF GREEN FIELDS AND RAINBOWSFOR SOME REASON IT JUST HAS THAT EFFECT ON YOU!
3,Ok,I like it a lot but the mat ripped which I don't like it for my children and the timer is bad .....I wish it was better
3,A good first effort.,"Clemens has created a fully dimensional, very believable character in Stella and surrounded her with an excellent supporting cast. She paints a realistic picture of farm life and has structured a solid mystery around it. My only hesitation is that, to me, it seems a bit too structured and a bit predictable. But the overall result is a good, solid, enjoyable first book."
1,Not the best horror in the woods movie I have ever seen,An unattracive man and an unattractive woman go camping in the California woods and babble on about nothing and they meet a creepy guy with a rifle. Not to give away the ending but if you are dumb enough to watch the entire thing you deserve the pain.
5,Late night ecstasy,"Tom's first 3 LPs are almost perfect. This has some wonderful songs and performances, he could actually still sing here and this may be a shock to people who have only heard his later records. The production is a little ""thin"" but this is a wonderful record."
2,The Waits Stalks at Midnight,"What could I say that hasn't already been said about this album? Well, I could say it's good. No one has ever said that. And there's a reason for it. This is an awful album. Everything that could have been done wrong, was. I can't believe that this is the same man who brought us that other stuff. This is such a sub-par record that I felt sickened by the whole experience. Do yourself a favor and avoid all this bad noise."
3,Not my favorite.,This certainly isn't my favorite CD. I like a few songs on it & that is all. Maybe it's just Fado music that isn't my favorite.
4,needs lyrics,"Love the music, but feel you need to know the lyrics to 'feel' the music. I bought this after watching a TV documentary which had sub titles, and was so much better."
2,Teething babies bite the foam apart!,"I don't own this one. We have a keyboard that looks like the same material. Ask the manufacturer of the danger incurred with teething, and babies with a few bottom and upper teeth chewing on this.Regards,Ray Konchalski"
5,Shogun Assassin: A cinematic visionary's dream.,"This has got to be one of the most visually impressive films of the genre to have come out of Japan in the last 30 years. Stunning cinematography with top notch scenes of blinding swordplay make Shogun Assassin an absolute must-see for fans. Tomisaburo Wakayama plays the central character with integrity and realism. One of the greatest scenes in the film, in my opinion, is when the boy Daigoro fetches food for his wounded father. Taking rice-cakes from under a Buddha statue, and leaving his jacket in exchange. This scene is very touching, and fills my heart with compassion every time I watch it. Fantastic!"
5,That Cub is dangerous.,"The second movie is as good as the first. Female ninja, a traitor who plans to sell out his clan and the three Gods of Death make this a great film. Lots of spraying blood, flashing swords, drama, screaming, humor and plotting.And Cub is dangerous. He takes out one of the female ninja and even slices the feet off a couple of assassins of the Yagyu clan. Baby Cart at the River Styx is a perfect sequel. Makes you feel good all over. A family film."
5,always smooth,"Wonderful work; I just miss Jayotis Washington's voice on this album. And they still don't have a band because they never, never need one."
2,Vertical Mounts Beware!,"I used this product to mount my Garmin Nuvi 660 to the dash of my Tahoe, but after less than three weeks, it fell off. You can stick it back on, but once it has fallen, it never has the same grip. I suppose these things might work great on a horizontal mount, but beware if you intend to mount on a vertical surface. After having used up the disk which came with my Nuvi and now this one, I am looking at other options such as an AC duct mount."
5,One of the best albums of the seventies!,"This is one of the best recordings of the 70's. I bought it when I was 13 years old and haven't stopped listening to it having gone through album, 8-track, cassette and CD versions of it. And it just keeps getting better and better with each listening. From the famous opening lyric of ""Harry's House"" -- 'a helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof/like a dragonfly on a rock' to the African drumbeats on ""The Jungle Line"" (and this a full decade before Paul Simon and Sting were lauded for their experimentations with African music) to the haunting ""Shades of Scarlett Conquering"" the album leaves one with the indelible impression of an artist at the peak of her talents."
1,Shipping fake,"Just to let you know that i have ordered this book a month ago and I'm still haven't receive it !!! Of course they already charged my account. If you really need it just go over to the nearest Borders and buy it,Illustrated Guide to the NEC: Based on the 2005 National Electrical Codeat least you will not have this headache waiting for something that may be in your house six months later !!!! I will never buy from this distributor again in my life. I have ordered things two weeks after this one and they are already with me !!!!!"
4,a journey through Platipus's finest trance creations,"This is tricky to review, for several reasons. Undoubtedly almost all of these tracks are classics and/or standouts. Unfortunately, you have a chunk of these already if you are a trance fan- these songs are all over various compilations. While it's not the label's fault their stuff is good, it'll be up to you to decide if you want to hear a portion of your trance collection remixed and in a different track order.But if you don't have much trance, well there's definitely quality here. Without covering all 24 songs and artists, I'll just say you won't be disappointed by the mixing or the songs. But beware that some of these tunes are older and there is a wider variety of styles than you'd get on a normal comp because of it.I'm giving it a 4, but beware that if you have a trance collection you'll have portions of this and if you are new to the genre this isn't the ideal CD to start with."
2,You get hat you pay for,"Just got this and the lug nuts key is already damage(bent). There is a saying,""you get what you pay for""."
1,Defective thread bolt,"Amazon: be carefull with the quality of this product, today I try to install this set and we find a bolt with defective thread. After check that I have decided don't install this set in my car because I will produce a damage in car-thread."
3,How to use this..,I ordered this hoping to use this with my laptop. Upon arrival I realized that this is an accessory to another set of more expensive equipment.
2,Boring DVD,"I sat thru the first hour of this dvd, MAN was it boring. I wouldn't spend money on this piece of crap."
1,"Typical McMahon, yep.","First he screws DX & his attitude goes on & on again like his old ways back then. Doesn't he know that he ain't tougher than any other wrestler here in the WWE, say like the Rock for example. He's so afraid of them so he attacks them from behind like the coward that he is so with that said you kissa** mother******s out there who loves this man, ya'll're making the biggest mistakes of y'alls lives including if y'all're following the likes of this f$$$$$ here.P.S. Hell, even I can beat this guy up easily."
1,"Ha ha ha ha ha ha, I like WE! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA.","oh ah, I'm a tough 61 year old hag that likes to make people bleed to death, yeah right. This guy couldn't even pull out a plundger just to dig his own a** in. I laugh at each in every one of you morons out there that like this guy & his s***.Hell, Korn's ""Deuce"" DVD is better than this, the greatest metal bands of all time!"
4,Puzzle,"When I received this puzzle form Amazon I wondered how the fit so many puzzles in such a moderately sized box. How they did it is that each puzzle is in the same box. They have 8 compartments (which are separated by cardboard dividers). Luckily the backs of the puzzles are color coded so that even if they get mixed it is quick and easy to sort them out.The downside of these puzzles is that they are about half the thickness of your average puzzle piece, thus they damage easily. Also the shapes seem to be almost cookie cutter puzzle pieces. There is little variety in piece size or shape."
5,Rock the Flock,The guys have really matured in their music! This album is very deep and great for a college student or any student growing in Christ! =) The beats are great and Nate really pulls through taking the lead vocals! This album really makes you think and I love that! BUY this cd it rocks!
5,Great..it definatley growns on you!,"When I 1st got the cd i thought "" Yeah its alright."" but now i have become hooked! The music begins to speak to you on a personal level and its use of metaphors make it even more unique. I highly recommend this Cd! If, when you buy the cd, you are not automatically pleased, give it time. I along with others have found that the music grows on you as you listen to it more because the words become more meaningful."
4,believable and immensely satisfying,"In her legal practice workaholic January Stewart defends abused children. She's closed off her heart from romantic involvement because of her own childhood abuse - and a terrible secret that she must hide. Coming into her life like a thunderstorm from the Past, Michael Hayward, with his trained reporter's eye, can see through the frumpy business clothes, high-powered conferences, and courtroom drama that cloaks the beautiful January Stewart. It will take everything he's got to win her heart and uncover her secret. An unexpected twist at the end of the story makes TEMPTATION FROM THE PAST by Cindy Gerard believable and immensely satisfying. Very well done!"
3,A good shoe for a good price,"This shoe is made of nice material, and is fairly comfortable, I'm a twelve and it is a tad big, so perhaps a half size down from your usual might be suggested, but they fit well, and most importantly, they're a great price."
4,Long Overdue Tribute,"And a darn good one at that! The album has a good mix of renditions faithful to the originals (We've Been Had, True to Life, Graveyard Shift, New Madrid), original interpretations (Screen Door, Steal the Crumbs, Fatal Wound), and spirited covers with a solid nod to the original, but infused with unique style (Still Be Around, Slate). Perhaps the highest achievement for a tribute album is to make you enjoy songs that weren't really among your favorites - this album did that for me, particularly Dolly Varden's soulful take on Steal the Crumbs. For Tupelo fans, this is a must. For the uninitiated, this would be a great companion to one of UT's albums - I'd recommend No Depression and Slate as good introductions to the band that most successfully married punk and country."
5,"One of McLean's more ""outside"" recordings","""Let Freedom Ring"" features McLean at his most Ornette Coleman-eqsue. The presence of Billy Higgins on drums certainly helps in that regard. Rounding out this quartet date are two somewhat obscure players, both of whom smoke on this session: Walter Davis, Jr. on piano and Herbie Laws on bass. Laws in particular makes his presence felt with his versatile playing -- there's some very nice, avant-gardish arco bass on ""Melody for Melonae"", and some good fun riffing on ""Omega"". Three of the four compositions are McLean originals, with Bud Powell's ""I'll Keep Loving You"" rounding out the record.No frills, no bonus tracks, no alternate takes. The disc clocks in at a short, but sweet 38 minutes. The disc sounds great; Van Gelder's presence as the recording engineer at the original session helps greatly in that regard."
5,Go there,"This was my intro to Tom Waits and I've loved everything he's done ever since. I'd even say that the first Tom Waits album you can live without but Nighthawks is a gem. The only reason I'm here to write this review is: I'm going to buy this baby again! Don't hesitate if you've never heard Tom Waits before: this is a great, step-right-up, intro to Mr. W that you will never regret."
3,Wish the actual artists sang the songs...,"Great selection of country songs for kids!! Would have been more pleasant on the ear to hear the original artists sing the songs. :o) I do think the ""I Like it, I Love it (i want some more of it) and ""Whose Your Dadddy"" (""...you know I got it, so come and get it..."") could have been left off the list. They are great songs but come on...I don't want to hear my little girls singing them. Freaks me out and is totally inappropriate. But otherwise the kids will enjoy them!"
3,"ok, i guess","this book was pretty good. however, it was a disapointment to read it after reading Tamora Pierce's other books, like the Wild Magic series and the Alanna books."
