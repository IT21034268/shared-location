3,Operation - made by Milton Bradley,"Another game that I find it amazing that is made available in this hi-tech age we live in.As a kid,I thought this game was okay.Purpose is to remove these tiny plastic parts from the operating board.Comes with twelve parts that's to be 'professionally' removed with a pair of tweezers.Don't lose the parts and this game should last awhile.Anyone else remember the TV ad for this game way back when as the girl in pigtails reads off the instuctions on the card,""Take out wrenched ankle...""?That commercial may've done more damage than Milton Bradley knows.Requires two size AA batteries."
3,Depends on who is playing,"This game was okay. I had the game when I was little and now, my younger sister has it. The concept of the game is unique and fun. However, I would not recommend it for somebody who gets annoyed easily because the sound on it is really irritating and loud. It is also somewhat scary for really young children. But overall, it is pretty fun."
1,i was sent the incorrect version from what i ordered,"amazon had listed the ""original"" operation for $29.99, which is what i ordered. i was sent the ""new"" version, the one made for small kids, that sold at mass merchants for $7.99. when i complained, hasbro ""generously"" offered to let me have this version (which i didn't want) for $15. crazy. fortunately, i was able to return this & get a full credit. what a bother though, and an extreme disappointment..."
2,Buy Two,"I got it because I wanted the volume control. When I got it, it did what I wanted... for 3 months. The paint started peeling off within a month of use. A couple months later, the sound control stopped working, and than a few days later one headphone stopped working. I would only recommend buying this with another, or ordering a pair every few weeks. I decided to go with some other company, I've had issues with Panasonic headphones before."
2,I Expected Much More,"This is not going to be a long review, but I did expect more movies. I remember watching these kind of movies late at night or on saturday mornings so I think they are great dispite the budget of these type of films. I dont think I will purchase Vol II of the Shaw Brothers collection."
5,shawbrothers collection 4dic set,"I like all martial art movies that are in english,and not sub title in engilsh print.All 4 movies were clear."
3,Money Mischief,"The reader is not a person I would any common ground with. She is very hard to understand as she reads the book too fast and as if I know the subject inside and out. Maybe the book is over my head? I am not sure as I will not pass this audio on the someone else. I also own the soft cover book of Money Mischief and have read some of it, which I enjoyed. I feel the book will be the answer if all is to be well. I have limited time to read and this will take some time to finish up."
3,Less than I expected,Redundent with little real meat. A easy read but light on history and analysis for anyone with a modest knowledge of monetary policy and history.
5,Money Mischief,"Although I have not completed reading this book, it came in a timely fashion and so far I am extremely satisfied with it's content."
2,MAKE SURE YOU'RE QUALIFIED,"I am a high school economics teacher and was looking for something to deepen my knowledge of the subject. As a pro free-market teacher (yes, there are a few of us out there)I turned to Friedman. I have seen him in interviews on YouTube and admire his clear thinking and firm convictions in the inability of government to solve economic problems.This book however, should be reserved for intermediate to advanced level university students specializing in economics. There are interesting stories throughout but much will be above the level of the novice. God bless you Mr. Friedman for all your work advancing the cause of the free-market."
3,Understanding the current financial crisis,"Quite an interesting review of past missteps in the world of money and finance. Puts a new perspective on the fragile state of our economy.For a casual reader like myself, there is a bit too much detail (rehashing) of the missteps of Useless Grant and the Congress of 1873. I think it could use 50-100 fewer pages in the middle. It would then be a quick read with insights that everyone ought to appreciate."
1,Save Your Money - Propoganda,"This work is a flat out lie and it would not suprise me if New Press (the publisher) isn't eventually required to publish a formal retraction.There are frequent remarks which are presented as ""fact"" that are completely unsupported yet used as a basis to make sweeping, ridiculous proposals.For example; Shugarmann claims that handguns are ""rarely"" used for self-defense yet frequently cites them used in the majority of crimes committed. Just the opposite is true - see USA Today 4/11/08 (no pro-gun publication for sure).This can not be called a book - it is Pure Propoganda which requires the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" (Hillary Clinton) to get through it."
1,lacking in facts,this book is better left unread. objective data will always serve one better than prpoganda. if youre already convinced no protection is the best defense but you need to reassure your feelings than this is for you. if on the otherhand you want hard facts go elswhere.
1,PRIOR TO PURCHASE REALLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Prior to purchasing anything from Spinkeeper Stores, I suggest you contact there customer service at (800) 986-1610. They have best price guarantees on there own website, but it is cheaper on Amazon. This company makes me very skeptical. They were very rude when it comes to customer service, and before you purchase anything make sure you can return it. THANKS AGAIN FOR THE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE."
5,One of the funniest books I've ever read,"I've loaned my copy to multiple folks and they all ask me the same question, ""what are these spots on the page"" and I tell them it's where I snarfed espresso all over the book laughing. Honestly one of the funniest books I've ever read. I struggled through the Bridges of Madison County just to be able to enjoy this delight that much more."
3,Not your cand land,"OK, first of all, my son loves this. HOWEVER, I hate the redesign they did. WHy screw up a good thing by making the board busier with useless characters? I spent FAR too long explaining why some guy was snowboarding incorrectly on an ice cream bar instead of skiing on Popsicle sticks or riding sideways. (yes, my 4 year old noticed this and pointed it out) And why, if you are doing a redesign, not make the person who wins get to be king or queen of candyland? If you are adding plot to a insanely simple toddlers game, make them have to help the citizens along the way. We did have a lot of fun designing our own giant board and drawing and coloring it. Cotton candy forest and the hot fudge swamp were fun additions, as was the dragon on chocolate mountain. Sooooo, your kids will probably be happy, as long as you do not spend too much time griping about how the old one was better."
2,Boring,I was expecting much more fun game. My daughters are almost 4 and they get bored after 10 minutes :( It's so slow going and boring. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.
4,How to put SKILL in Candyland.,"Each player draw a hand of three cards. Play a card out of your hand on your turn, then draw a replacement.A card may be played on either yourself OR another player. Note that a color card can only move any player forward; this is mainly useful for sticking opponents in the swamp, and so on.Other players can now send you to the swamp/pitfalls, but on the other hand, it is easier to get out with the greater card choices(It will also be easier to get on the Rainbow Bridge, which seldom happens in the regular game). There will be no more sending yourself back by drawing a special card, but other players will now be dumping the things on you if said things send you back- which should liven the game up.This variant can teach basic strategy skills, and make the game a little less simple for adults who get roped into it. But beware of teary three-year olds who get sent way back by -mean Mr. Mint- when they are about to win. (That would be -candy hearts- in the old game)."
3,Not THAT great.,"I got this game to teach my daughter how to play games. She didn't see any incentive to keep playing the game when you just move and then someone else moves, then again and again and again. She was totally bored and wanted to play with something else. It's pretty atypical of her too, because she loves matching games and the like...."
5,I Remember This Game,I remember playing this game in kindergarten and I always enjoyed it. My husband and I were so excited about having a child to share this game with that we bought it when our son was 5 months old and we have played it a few times to show him what it is even though he's not old enough to play it. I'm positive he'll enjoy it when he's older.
5,Classic,"How can you go wrong with this game? It's been around forever and is still popular. Bought it for my 3-year old niece, and she loves it."
1,Why do toys these days all have to be made like crap?,"The box was smashed, the popper hardly pops and is totally cheap--in order to get it to pop you practically have to use a sledge-hammer. Certainly my very strong four year old son cannot push the popper down--when one can actually get it to pop, the tactile experience is extrememely unsatisfying and the noise is not pleasant either--more like a 'bang' than a pop. Thoroughly unsatisfying. I would rather pay a few more dollars and get a game that is decently made and comes in a real box that could actually store the toy."
4,Trouble - Popomatic - Good Family Fun,"Trouble is a classic game - Milton Bradley brings us the classic board game that is fun for the whole family to play.Four players can play this, my only concern is the popper, I wonder how long it will last, the metal popper is a little flimsy and may break over extended use - we'll see. You can always use some dice as a backup. Game is fun for the family to play.I purchased this along with Connect Four, good games next to Checkers and Chess."
3,"nostalgic toy, cheapened over time","The game is the same as I remember from my youth... but the quality of the board has certainly suffered. I'm surprised at how flimsy the game board is. Sure, it's heavy plastic on top, but the ""color"" cardboard underneath is held on only by 4 rubber ""feet."" I can see already that this contemporary TROUBLE game board will not outlast the way my 4 year old will play with it."
2,Just ok,"This game was missing a piece, making it almost useless. Only 3 players can play at at time because of this missing piece. I will not be buying games from Amazon anymore because of this."
3,remember it a little more sturdy,"it works. all the parts are there and the popper pops. but this is made as cheap as possible. the colorful bottom to the game is a piece of paper that is only affixed by pushing the paper into four holes. i can see this not lasting long. but, it is the game we wanted. again, i remember it a little more sturdy than this."
3,"Game idea is fine, materials are cheap","I grew up playing this game and I liked it as a kid. Thought we would get it too for our kids. The board and pieces are much cheaper quality than before. I guess you expect that to a degree, but it was still very disappointing. It's not like the game was made of super high quality parts before, but they still found a way to make them cheaper apparently. Overall, it works fine and kids like it, but I would've liked to see it made better."
3,Just Average,"The game just isn't that much fun for anyone over 6. All you do is pop the dice and move your pieces. I used it to enforce counting for my kids, but it bored me to tears. It has the same concept as ""Sorry,"" but that one is just more fun with the same counting benefits. As for the popper not working, ours was always fine and my 4-year-old can push it just fine."
2,"Poorly made, cheap plastic",This isn't the same as I remember as as child. The board is a flimsy plastic and the popper is kind of sad.
4,Lean for Life by Bass,"The author integrates dieting and exercise. He advises that starvationdiets ultimately backfire. In addition, exercise must become a permanentpart of the lifestyle. The author calls for tough workouts includingtreadmill sessions up to 40 minutes building up to the highest speed levels. He cites the equation: Training + Enjoyment = SuccessThe body burns 14-16 calories per day per pound. A 165# person requiresapproximately 2500 calories per day. Weight training keeps fat burningbecause bigger muscles burn more calories. A 155# person burns approximately 90 calories in a simple 1/2 or so walk. This book couldhelp in losing weight and keeping it off permanently."
4,Another sweet picture book on Halloween,"I collect picture books on Halloween, which is my favorite holiday. I like this one because of the silhouette-style of illustration. Just the right amount of ""spookiness"" but charming enough that it's not overly scary for the very littlest children."
5,Great shirts,"This is a 2nd purchase of these shirts for my husband. Good cut and finish (can I say that about T-shirts?), wash well, comfortable. Other reviewers have said that the shirts run long--for my 6'3"" husband this is a good thing."
4,Champion Baseball Raglan T-Shirt,The shirt I got fit perfectly! The material used was not low-quality and the color is still the same after several washes. I've also worn this during an actual game on a hot afternoon and I didn't feel warm at all.
2,"What is this, a bootleg?","I admit that I didn't read the previous reviews, and snatched this up on the spur of the moment with another item I'd ordered. I was attracted by the price and by the apparent completeness of the earliest of Dragnet episodes. I'm puzzled by the omission of the Dragnet theme, so iconic that without it, the shows seem very flat. I'm disappointed at the video quality as well, as if these are copied from a well worn film rather than the masters. Overall, for the cheap price, I guess one can't expect too much."
4,"Good stuff, but read the fine print","I got what I intended to buy - the ORIGINAL TV series from the 1950's. It is a good quality transfer, and I am happy with it. Just be aware that this is NOT the Dragnet most people have seen with Harry Morgan as Detective Bill Gannon. Having said that, it is a nice set and a good buy."
1,Never received the DVD.,"I blame myself for not noting that I never received this DVD. I order a fair number of DVDs from Amazon, but this one never came. I will contact the seller and see if we can trace the package. First time I have not gotten a delivery, so I'm not posting this as a negative. I'm sure it will be straightened out. I rented it and have in my Blockbuster library. Liked it so much, I guess I bought the DVD. Or I forgot I had it online. Anyway. Didn't realize I had bought it till I got the e-mail asking me to give a review on my purchase, and I'm like, ""Hey, I didn't remember buying that one and I don't have it now???"" LOL. So, searched my library of DVDs, which IS visible and somewhat organized. No movie. Go figure. Not a negative on the seller. Just one of those glitches. Stuff happens now and then."
3,Mostly an Adam Sandler Movie,"Cute, but he humor was more Adam Sandler style. Some predictable parts, but for the most part, great scenary and some really funny scenes. Nichole Kidman pulls off an impressive performance as well. Worth the watch, but not recommending owning this one unless you are a true die-hard Adam Sandler fan."
2,Wow... This movie was lame.,"The premise of this movie was moronic and the story lines were ridiculous. To me, it was another excuse of a movie created by Sandler to showcase himself as a good guy in the end with hotties fighting over him. All this set in Maui/Kauai, which is convenient for everyone in the cast. I was a huge fan of Adam Sandler early in his career, but this movie was not entertaining. I would not recommend it - except to enjoy the sights of Brooklyn Decker, Aniston, and Hawaii as a back drop. Boring. This movie needed an editor."
2,Just stay away from it.........,"Paint by numbers typical Sandler fair with eye candy and scat humour for the guys, disguised with a loosely romantic comedy plot for the ladies. Hollywood unthinking drek that spews $$$ into undeserving and untalented people's pockets.What really took this down was all the songs by Sting who clearly helped finance this mud and I swear he was in a cameo as one of the hula dancers."
5,adam sandler jennifer aniston ++ cast,I like the movie just go with it!The girls are very funnyAnd are super sexy!One of my favorites dvds!
3,Could be an inspirational story,"I think that the story of someone who was a shipyard apprentice in Glasgow, Scotland at the age of 16 who rose to be a successful stand up comic and actor, with little or no training could be seen as an inspirational story.The book is written by his wife, Pamela Stephenson, who is a trained psychologist. I found her writing style to be a little dull and I got tired of the endless name dropping as she and Billy went to various functions.Overall Billy's life story deserves to be read and he should be admired for his achievement."
4,A place for healing to begin,"Joyce tells her story in a manner that is bold, courageous, and transparent. She holds nothing back; both her strengths and her shortcomings are displayed on the pages of Beauty for Ashes. This book helped me take a good look at myself and to then focus on the nature and promises of God. It helped me at a time when I was very ill and had faced many losses. (Author,With Great Mercy.)"
5,Help For The Abused Person,"My dear friend, who had undergone sexual abuse by her uncle and grandfather before age 5, and again by her domineering husband at age 35, found healing truth, guidance, and steps toward recovery in this wonderful, bible-based, advice book by Joyce Meyer. Another of Joyce Meyer's books, ""Managing Your Emotions Instead of Your Emotions Managing You"" has helped continue her recovery and given her tools to deal with life in a healthy manner which helps her to realize joy - something which had eluded her until now.Managing Your Emotions Instead of Your Emotions Managing You"
2,I wanted to like this book,"This was my first attempt to read this author, and I really wanted it to be helpful. But her words are trite and cliche, and alas I was too bored by her 'Sunday school' answers and explanations to even complete this book. I agree with the general message I believe she is hoping to convey, but her words reek of cheap, rote Christian answers without the raw honesty that I believe God values and abides in. I am glad this book has helped others, but I could not relate at all."
3,Beauty for Ashes,"As an author myself, this book is a bit of a challenge to read owing to the continual interruption of thought by the author's restating, rewording and redefining Biblical passages in parenthesis centered in most sentences throughout.However, the content carefully targeted to those of us with trauma in our past and how to use faith to help with recovery is helpful though overly preachy throughout.Bizy Writer"
5,Joyce Tells It Like It Really Is - No Sugarcoating,"Joyce offers her honest to goodness view of life's various challenges, both big and little, and how they can be overcome if you follow the word of God. She explains how our own thinking can hurt us or help us - depending on our attitudes. Addressing such things as abuse, anger, shame, guilt, depression, heartbreak, road rage, addiction, people pleasing, and many other unpleasant influences and behaviors, she has helped me find the light in life and my burden is lighter now. Trusting in God is something Joyce has helped me to do on a daily basis which has helped me get through some really dark days. I'm getting my life back on track and am headed in the right direction, thanks to Joyce's wording and straight forward language. She tells it like it is."
4,great for survivors,"I'm a sexual abuse survivor and I found this book very helpful and inspirational. I don't agree with everything she says because I'm not a Biblical fundamentalist, but I still found my faith in God strengthened, and found many of the Biblical passages to be inspirational to me. I've had a lot of trouble with faith because of what happened to me, and I can't listen to some religious people, but she's been through it all too, so my mind opened."
5,Best text for learning TP,"This is an excellent text. It take the student through the basics, emphasizing structured programming. I would recomend this highly as a first step in learning higher level programming languages. Students will learn to develop algorithms, pseudocode, documenting their program, and other good programming practices."
3,not my style,"although i found this book useful, it's more of a reference than a textbook, per se. it wasn't what i was looking for."
3,The Blessing,"I received a copy of the book, The Blessing, by John Trent and Gary Smalley, to review. Each of us were designed to need the blessing of our parents. Some of us receive that, and many others did not. This book is for adults who did not receive that important blessing, and for parents who now have an opportunity to give that blessing.The Blessing communicates important truthes regarding how to instill emotional well-being in our children through:~meaningful touch~a spoken message~attaching high value~picturing a special future~an active commitmentThis updated version provides Biblical support for giving our children our blessing, and then offers practical ways to institute this type of parenting.Although I loved, and agree with, the elements of truth in this book, I did not find most of this to be new."
5,Become a Blessing Champion!,"This book is a blessing. Wow! A definite need to read for just about everyone. The time is now. Be a blessing. The importance of the blessing is seen throughout scripture and in the observation of individuals. Even babies look toward others for acceptance.From the first time that they reach out on their own, their eyes turn toward others for the nod or look of approval. The blessing is basic to humanity.The authors of The Blessing book have listed 5 basic elements to the blessing:Meaningful touchA spoken or written messageAttaching high valuePicturing a special futureAn active commitmentTruly what relationship would not benefit from these 5 elements being practiced?Are you ready to become a blessing champion?To get started check out the website at [...]"
1,Disappointed,"The color of the collar is not even close to being red...it is pink! I have called the shipper, Hollywood Pet Jewelry and they have not returned my call. Shipping is too much to return...never again on amazon. 14 inch Red Leather dog collarMerchant Hollywood Pet Jewelry"
1,"The ""valiant"" Mr. Harris cheats at his own game","Joshua Harris was the man we had to thank for Christians ""Kissing Dating Goodbye."" Now we have him to thank for confusing us by doing a play on words where ""courting"" is acceptable. In the book, Boy Meets Girl, courting is a word merely replacing the concept of ""dating."" He offers no real solutions, and the book is a bunch of fluff mixed in with overly-used-out-of-context-scriptures. Josh Harris angers me with his hypocrisy because he's making money doing it. Don't support this book or this author. It will only drag you down in the mind and spirit."
2,Book was not in good shape,The book was in decent shape at best... There was writing all over it and weird stains all over the covers. I was kind of annoyed when I got it but then again it was only $8 so I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Nonsense,"In the first place, the couples he discusses in this poorly written book are already divorced(so much for courtship being better than dating). For seconds he does not place any value on women, demanding that they ""let men lead"" in everything. And finally, this guy writes book after book about how sex is the creation of ""satan"" yet he is married and has three kids. This guy is full of himself and full of crap."
1,"Narrow, sexist trash with no Biblical integrity","Unfortunately this is yet another classic case of validating an impeccibly narrow view of scripture through loose and popular one-liners; I am staggered by the lack of integrity, but even more so by the continued obsession with the Church of matters of petty morality, at the expense of true Gospel issues. Boy meets Girl indeed - Joshua Harris is clearly a boy in this one; I do not recommend that you attempt to chart any of his growth into genuine masculinity through this or any of his other work. Try 'Money, Sex and Power' by Richard Foster."
2,I Don't Get It,"If Joshua Harris is advocating courting based on his willingness to serve God, why does the first chapter of this book deal with how he fell in love with a woman based on factors in her physical appearance like her eyes and her height? He says he was ready for marriage and so he started courting; and yet he had not seriously spoken with this woman! Plus, nervously calling and asking her out sounds like....uhoh..a date.The appeal of this book among young readers especially bothers me. It is geared toward older persons who are ready for marriage. What are younger readers supposed to do during the important years in which they are discoving and developing their sexual feelings?I gave BMG two stars because of the way this couple has chose to live a Godly life and practice what they preach. Otherwise, all of Mr. Harris's fuss over the wisdom of courting seems strange and convoluted in comparison to the ways of most Christians."
1,okay,"Dating and Courting isn't it all one in the same? It's all the same, just different words are used. There is ""trial"" courting which is the same as casual dating. I feel that in many ways this book is written for those raised in the church, and not everyone is raised like that. What about those that don't have godly parents? Whom should they go to guidance? Its unrealistic in many ways. It's a good starting point for teens but I feel that the author misses the mark in other ways. I liked, ""When God Writes Your Love Story by Eric and Leslie Ludy"" much better. Its more realistic."
3,which is the correct part number for this pump 20-864 or 20904,The A-1 Cardone pump you have listed for the 1996 cheverolet Impala on your site has a a part# 20904 is this correct?All of the other pumps that list for this vehicle by A-1 Cardone have the Part# 20864 which is correct ?Are these pumps interchangeable by part #?Prior to ordering any part you always want to verify that it will fit!!
1,"Poorly made, too expensive, poor optics.","I obtained these binoculars a few weeks ago, and could only see double images, despite every attempt at focusing, adjusting the spacing, etc.They do not gather as much light as a 70mm pair of binoculars should, and the extreme zoom, while sounding good, makes them impossible to use without a tripod, and binocular mounting accessories.In addition, when accidentally dropped from a 16"" height, while in their ""protective case"", the entire front lens housing and assembly snapped off, destroying the unit entirely. It was made of very very thin plastic."
3,good but shipping too high,"This is actually a good, flavorful tea, but the cost of shipping is overpriced. I received a sampler of Ashby's for Christmas a few years back and enjoyed all of their flavors. So, yay tea, boo s&h."
2,Incorrect Knowledge,"While playing this game for the first time, and using less than one quarter of the supplied cards, our family found four cards with incorrect answers. For example, one card claimed that Grand Prix races take place not on the road but on an oval track. Another claimed that radar, not sonar, uses sound waves to detect objects. Another spelled the Ebola virus as ""E boli"". The fourth card had an answer that was correct, but was not the only correct answer, as was claimed. The makers of this game would do well to hire a fact checker."
1,"Mis-advertised , by ""someone""! How do you assign ""0"" stars?","Given the purchase of a new Samsung cell phone (SGH-A707) from Cingular, this should be an ideal accessory for my Kensington PowerBook charger. Wrong! The M-5 tip is too large (by several mm) to mate with tiny port on this model phone."
1,makes no sense at all,"i do not recommend this book. okay i know this book is supposed to be for little kids but its just really wierd. how can a 2nd grade teacher not know how to do anything?? her students have to teach her EVERYTHING!!!! Reading writing math!!! I don't know what mr. gutmans inspiration was when he was writing this series.also, the character AJ was a terrible role modle for the readers. aj does not like school at all. and i know a lot of moms read to their kids at night. but since the book is about aj and his lunatic teachers the readers are going to follow ajs role. and maybe they will stop liking school. it is a possibility. so i do not recommend this book this book to anyone."
5,A must read for every dad!,The best book on parenting I have read. This book will reach you no matter what kind of childhood and relationship you had with your dad. Mothers should read this as well. The writer gives examples of instances he had with his dad and his children all through the book.
2,There's got to be a better one,"I was not impressed with this book. The 'unusual"" introduction using a BLOB to explain COM was dreadful. Basically, I didn't like the author's writing style, and lost confidence in his explanations of the subject. There were errors in the text. Maybe it's just me, but I am annoyed with little things like not naming something correctly, such as saying the ""A"" in ATL means ""ActiveX"" instead of ""Active""."
3,Disappointing.,"After I read Dan Abnett's five-star ""Horus Rising"" (book 1 in the series), I eagerly awaited Graham McNeill's book two ""False Gods"". Yet, I approached this book with some concern based on more than a few of the Amazon reviews. Alas, those reviews with negative concerns were right! The first 100 pages were OK, the last 100 pages were OK. (OK, but neither good nor great)Most of the middle 200 pages, however, could easily have been condensed into 75-100 pages, as the author went back and forth over almost the same territory -- a confusing mystical/spiritual territory at that -- to explain the beginning of Horus's descent. How much better it would have been to take a more straight-forward path where ""pride goes before a fall"", not ""mysticalness"".I'm now reading the third book of the opening trilogy, and Ben Counter is writing at the high level we saw with Dan Abnett. So don't give up on book two -- it still lays a foundation (however poorly) for book three."
2,Writers experiment,"It's always interesting when the subject matter, plot and characters are the same but the writers change mid-story. The first book by Dan Abnett had superior plot development and interesting dialogue. Moving to the second book the plot dissolved into a Zombie novel with little to no creativity in the battle scenes. The dialogue sounds like it was written in a middle school creative writing class. I'll move to the third book more hopeful."
1,nothing demystified,The title is very misleading. Less than one-third of the book is devoted to DDS. Certainly he complicates the presentation of DDS and provides no practical examples of design. The author can improve the material where the book can be of use.
3,Help with sizing,"I bought this as a replacement for my Moto Shade/Qwik Shed 10 x 20 and found that although it is apparently of good quality it is too small. Moto Shade owners should use a ""King Canopy"" compatible cover. A useful sizing guide can be seen at <...>"
3,DVD Studio Pro DVD,"I ordered this product due to the fact of having an earlier version of DVD Studio Pro that I've never been able to use. After receiving the dvd I found out it's for a later version of the program. Some of the information is helpful but for the most part it doesn't help. None of the screens look the same, can't open the same looking windows, and the title and menu buttons don't work or look the same. I was able to learn how to get a picture on the main screen but still don't know how to get buttons or menus to work. That was the major decision in buying this dvd so haven't really gotten much further than I was to begin with. I'd really recommend that the versions be put in that it is designed for."
3,Good Boston band that was not quite ready for primetime...,"Another example of a good Boston band that was not quite ready for primetime. This was their major label released by Epic in 1990. While listening to this, I could almost feel my feet sticking to the floor at The Rat. Most of this album is decent but there are three exceptional songs that could have put them over the top nationally...""Back Of My Mind"", ""International"" (with a surprisingly good trumpet solo) and ""Hope The Boat"" which sounds very much like REM with a violin."
3,Not the same as the newer edition,The 4th edition bares a little resemblance to the 5th edition. But don't be fooled the two books are different. Chapters have been switched and trying to follow along with the reading during class is a pain in the rear end. I don't recommend this book if you are trying to find an alternative to the 5th edition. Just go ahead and dish out the extra money for the new one.
1,Never Received,I never received the book! I am very disappointed and don't think I received a refund either.
5,Wonderful product,"This zafu is very comfortable to sit on. Quality is good, and I particularly like the zippered opening because my husband prefers a much softer cushion. Even though the color selection is very limited in comparison to the choices offered by the manufacturer, I am still very pleased with the plum color. Highly recommend it."
3,Great Quality - but not sure what product the other people brought...,"I'm impressed with the quality of the materials - very well made and though it's heavy, it feels like it will take years of wear and tear.A note on the other comments - I am 6'6"", and was looking for a cushion that was pretty tall (about 9""). So, based on the reviews, I decided to buy this item. It turns out that the item is really 5"" high and 15""-16"" in diameter. So, unless the other reviewers got a different product or they are only 3' tall - this is a good size for the average person."
2,NOT all the book is here,"Fabulous voice and very nice sound effects. I would give 5 stars, but... not ALL the book is read, only around half of it. I have the book in original(French) and there are so many sentences, paragraphs and whole chapters they skipped. I would have preferred more of the book instead of the bonus poems. They are nice.. but I wanted the book. :("
2,Not a for a gym locker,"I got this to use as a gym locker, but it's massive. Way too big to be used for this purpose. I'm sending it back for something more appropriately sized."
1,hunting down amanda,"i really didn't like this novel. everyone who tried to help amanda already had miserable lives anyway so why did they have to die for helping save amanda's life. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone, i'm glad i borrowed it and didn't buy it."
4,"Brilliant,,,","I decided to read this book out of curiosity when I read that Bjork had recommended everyone to read it. I knew that i was in for a shocking treat. Is it shocking? Yes, indeed. I personally wasn't too shocked by the erotic acts itself in the book, since none of it was new to me. I found it more shocking by how beautifully and yet frightful the narrative was...its such a page turner and definitely worth reading!"
3,Dreamlike and darkly pornographic,"I decided to read this book after hearing it was Bjork's favorite (I'm a huge fan). Like most people, I found it shocking and disturbing (and I'm not someone who's easily shocked), but not without merit. It really reads like a dream ... the kind you want to forget as soon as you wake up, and the kind you would never, ever want to describe to anyone else. So there's a definite courageousness to this book. The author had the guts to put all his demons right out there for all the world to see (well, read), and so, as disturbing as the book is, you have to respect that."
4,It's a book...,"This book arrived on time and in good condition. I'm not saying it's bad at all, but you have to read it to make your own mind up..."
4,Original exploration of the reality of death,"Jim Crace is an enormously talented writer as ""Being Dead"" loudly attests. Crace masterfully interweaves multiple time-lines in the lives of Joseph and Celice, including the tale of their decaying bodies after they are murdered on a beach. Joseph and Celice were married middle-aged zoologists. They were essentially unremarkable people, and their mundane lives are easily overwhelmed by their shared death. Crace's prose is often lyrical and always beautifully crafted - a stunning juxtaposition to the gruelling and gruesome scenes he is describing. Many people will be put off by his frank and vivid descriptions of dead bodies, but in many ways it is a fitting epitath for these pragmatic scientists. Altogether a challenging and impressive read."
1,Subwoofer Died on 2nd day,Sub-woofer died on the second day... Best Buy was zero help. 1000 watts my eye. No way can package this is such a poorly ventilated box.Good luck getting it fixedQ
4,good price,I bought this for my new apartment and its been a great buy so far.I didn't need anything to shake the walls so this is more than loud enough.The upscaling through hdmi works great if you know how to work the settings. I'm running it through a Samsung lnt4053 and it looks great. The only issue I've have is that my DVDs are starting to skip even when they are not scratched (a brand new copy of 28 weeks later.) I'm going to clean out this weekend and hopefully everything will be alright. Oh and be careful with the very flimsy disk tray.
2,"Acceptable, until it died","Enjoyed reasonably good service from this HTIB for about 18 months. Then one day it just wouldn't turn on. It's always been plugged into a surge protector. I think the power supply failed. Not worth getting repaired. I hate to have to re-run wires for a new set of HTIB speakers, so I'm looking for a replacement where I can use these old Philips speakers."
1,"Defective product, terrible customer service from Philips","This item was purchased for my husband as a Christmas gift. The alarm worked fine for about 10 days, then suddenly, even though set, the alarm would not go off. Then it would work for a few days again, and then fail, etc.I contacted Philips customer support. After several calls, disconnections and transfers and 2 hours of my time, it was deemed that the product is defective. In order to get a new one, I have to mail back the old one and pay for the shipping charges. Even though the item is under warranty, I have to pay shipping. Philips will not send me a new one until I mail back the old one.Based on my very poor experience with the customer support at Philips, it is doubtful that I will purchase anything from them again.Product review - lack of volume control is very annoying - the iPod or radio goes off and before you can reach your arm up to shut it off, the volume is blaring. Sound quality on the speakers is good."
3,Adequate but nothing special,"Bought this clock radio in order to have a radio with a iPod dock and it seems adequate for that task. In order to configure our Nano (or any MP3 player), you have to sort through a number of flimsy plastic frames that hold the player in place. In the case of our Nano, you have to really jam the player in, harder that you would expect, and the connection is tenous. Radio reception is OK. Doesn't have an AM band, which is irritating. I appreciate its small foot print. At $80, it's not cheap."
2,English for Brazilians,"The book is very basic and its pace is very slow. If you don't know English at all, it's OK."
2,Doesn't do much for me,"While admire Paul's mastery and this enormous undertaking, and congratulate him and wish him well, this album didn't touch me deeply. Part of it is some of the pieces. While Bach wrote incredible pieces, some of his pieces are just a lot of notes, dry, and not that beautiful. But even in the pieces that I love, like Chaconne, these interpretations didn't do much for me."
5,World in Peril,"This was an impotant piece of history that needed to be documented. The book did a great job of locating people and places that were secret at the time, while at least publishing the polar shift theory that was the result of plotting the movement of the earths magnetic north pole."
4,Underrated,"I have to say something about this particular band/album: it was released down here in Brazil in 1990 or so, and as far as I know I was the only one in my friends metal network who got it. Actually, I might be one of the few who bought it in the whole country. I doubt it sold over 50 copies overall.Which is just unfair, since it is a fine power/thrash metal album, with skilled musicians and a fine singer. The drummer is amazing and the twin guitar work is above average. Although the music is awesome, the package didn't help at all because any 8 year old kid would've come up with a better sleeve.The timing wasn't right either, since thrash metal was starting to descent and alternative heavy rock (or any other name they call it) was getting popular all over the world. Then Seattle came and smashed it completely.Nevertheless, if you're a metal fan who enjoys fast riffs and drumming, screaming vocals and the ocasional fair melody... go for it. It's at least worth checking."
1,Don't Buy - Many do not work!,"I purchased 4 of these for swimming pool gates. I set my new 4 digit code according to the instructions. On two of them, it works and I can lock, unlock, etc. just fine. On the other two I can set them, then then scramble the numbers and lock it and then open it ONCE and they work. But after the first time they ""loose"" the code and cannot be re-opened. On these two I had to pick the locks to get them off my gates which was a real hassle and close call that I almost had to replace the gates. When I finally got them off, sure enough the same routine. I reset them, they closed and re-opened ONCE and thereafter will not open to the code. Unfortunately, Amazon does not stand behind their products and will not take the two defective ones back since my fence and gates weren't ready for the locks until just after the 30 days expired. BTW, if I can pick these locks, then they certainly are not very secure from any bad guy."
4,Nice doll for the money.,"This is a nice doll for the money and seems to be well made. I bought it for my 3 year old grandaughter who hasn't played with it yet. This doll has brown eyes that do not open and close. With the red hair, I expected blue eyes, but I think my red haired granddaughter will enjoy syling the doll's hair and the cute accessories that come with it."
3,First Impression...,"I got this today and my first impression is that it is cheeplymade. One feature/function that it does not have is the ability to program track in the order one desires. Is this or is this not one of the most basic features one should expect from a cd player? It is part of what enjoying cds/mp3s is all about.As others have noted, the jack is noisy. It appears to be a minor problem. I am sending in my warranty card right away, though.On the plus side, the sound is very good. I took a vigorous walk @ lunch and it appeared to be relatively skip free throughout.Overall, it is not a bad basic sports cd player. If you absolutely need something in this price range that is water resistant, this might be up your alley. Otherwise, go with Panasonic, Phillips, or Sony...Good luck!"
1,THIS HEADSET IS NOT WORKING,"This was my first order on Amazon and when i received it, i plugged it in my xbox 360 controller to hear NOTHING!!! common man.....such a Big Disappointment, on other hand if any one can suggest me something? How do i make it work, do i need to do some extra settings for this headset to work? i thought plugging it in the contoller would make it work, but that didnt help. I have 2 different controllers and it wont work on both of em!....ANY SUGGESTIONS WILL BE HIGHLY APPRICIATED."
4,It's a gotta have,"I absolutely loved this novel. I usually read L.A. Banks Vampire Huntress series but I decided in a slight change of pace and boy did I get it. The story is about a woman trying to run away from her tragic past, with her child gone from a freak accident Angela doesn't know how to bounce back. After advice from a friend she decides to pick up the pieces from its point of origin, her grandmother's old house.This is a great ghost story but it involves so much more. It's a ghost story, a mystery, a drama, and of course Due uses a certain traditional African American religion as the basis of the novel. At times I feel like the author was channeling Steven King and I really did enjoy it, while the pace was a little slow in some parts the mystery of the story strings the reader along. Unlike Due's novel Joplin's Ghost the action starts on the first page and gets the reader invested."
4,The Good House until you get to the end,"I loved this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more. Their were times when I was afraid to go to sleep after reading some parts of the book. However, I must say that I was a little disappointed with the way the book ended. I felt she could have done better with the ending. Perhaps she could have done a sequell if she ended it differently. But I still love the book despite the ending."
1,uh.................,"No. No one should charge $21 for an e-book. No, I did not buy this book or any of her other overpriced drivel."
4,Rollercoaster Ride!,"I am a fan of Ms. Due's and have read My Soul to Keep and The Living Blood. Although I typically don't care for voodoo laced context, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Ms. Due held my interest as she integrated her well-developed characters and family into the supernatural story line. The book's end was a little disappointing but I didn't dwell on it too much as I was so engrossed in the story that my stomach ached! This book offers a great storyline! Great Reading!"
3,A Good Story With A Weak Ending,"The Good House was a good horror novel with strong characters that were fully realized. Ms. Due seems to be a good writer with lots of details in her novel. There were a few parts that slowed the book down that I thought weren't really necessary, but they did contribute to more fully developed characters. The real place where I think this book fell short was the ending. After all the death and horror of the book to have such a *poof* everything is perfect and wonderful ending was a let down. This was a good spooky read with a weak ending."
4,Spooky,Catches you right away. I was unable to put it down! Characters are well written. Plot very intriguing. Need some lights on.
4,a bit rough inside,"This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas. It is a bit rough inside, but works fine for most things."
4,Looks good for the price,I just got my oven in the mail. It look pretty well made. Nice and heavy. The lid fits a little loose but I think it should work just fine.
1,"Not ""The Pill Bag""","I have used ""The Pill Bag"" for several years and wanted to order more. Ordered these and received 100 of similar item called ""The Pill Pouch"" even though the photo clearly shows ""The Pill Bag."" The incorrect ones I received are more difficult to open and close than ""The Pill Bag."" I will throw the ones I received out (not worth return postage) and order from another vendor."
4,Very helpful to carry a day's worth of pills,"Several companies sell this product, which I find very useful for carrying around pills without being obvious. I occasionally have unexpected attacks of allergy. A couple of pills in a bag like this one fit neatly in a pocket or a pocketbook for women. Very helpful."
3,"Good for what they are, but...","I ordered a couple of sets of these for several different users (one set per user) and am happy that I ordered extras, since one of the sets contained two locks that didn't work.What I discovered when researching the problem is that while these locks carry the Master name, they are manufactured overseas to a much lower standard than the typical Master lock.Bottom line is that they're great locks for what they're designed to do... assuming that they work in the first place."
3,Mystery story with a guide dog,"Two teenage boys spend a summer trying to rehabilitate a traumatized guide dog, and solve a mystery. Their neighbor at a quiet Minnesota lake is rejoicing because his long-lost grandson has returned, but Don and Ned wonder why Jude is so evasive about his supposed years stranded in a remote Mexican village."
5,Arms of Mercy,I am enjoying this CD and using as part of my prayer time reflection. It arrived on time and in excellent shape.
5,Annointed,"No, I don't believe Kim Hill did this CD. GOD did this one. Ms. Hill is just the vessel. ""You Are Still Holy"" is probably one of the most annointed songs I have ever heard. Another artist has hit the mark. A very good pick."
5,Wonderful - So good on the ears and on the heart,"This CD is full of great song treasures sung by a a talented woman with a voice so pleasant to the ears. She sings in simple beauty with her soothing, mellow alto voice. The songs help point the soul upward to His safe and strong Arms of Mercy. It's a real keeper. I recommend it to all."
4,"Now my favorite book ever, it is hillarious yet sad !!",This is my favorite alot of young girls can relate to this book ecspecially me with my best friends dad being a preacher! It is hillarious and frighetningly sad at the same time! I love it!
4,Enjoyed this,"I really like historical stories, and this follows a lot of historical information. Gave a background to early English history."
5,Why wouldn't you read a Clifton Meador MD book?,"If medicine is your avocation as well as your vocation, you read books like this. And his are always pleasant."
3,Selections from Salmi a quattro chori Venice 1612,"Not in the same league as Monteverdi or the Gabrielis but interesting and worthy production, sponsored by the town of Viadana in Lombardia, from which (we assume) Lodovico took his family name.Recorded 1993. Timing 74'10, full texts in Latin. No translations, but then none needed for this repertoire, as anyone who buys this will already have several Monteverdi Vespers (and probably also the Cavalli and Rosenmuller Vesper sets on Harmonia Mundi)."
5,The True Story About Starting a Small Business -- Thank You!,I'm just about to return this book to my local library after savoring it for about two months; I hate to let it go! James Chan's honest and insightful description of his path to tycoonship was fascinating and eye openning. I'm on the brink of a whole new world springing from my home office after two years of a spare hour here and there. This book has helped me imagine how my life might look -- with one eye on the stars and another on approaching potholes in the pavement.
5,"From the heart, not just the head","I love this book. When new to consulting, I consumed a number of ""how to"" books that focused on excellent techniques, but none of them helped with my daily motivation. Dr. Chan's book, however, helped me build a vision for my consultancy (which is now very successful) and overcome the many emotional challenges that anyone might face every day as we conquer the uncertainty of this interesting profession. This is a book I will definitely read again."
2,A very depressing movie!,"A very depressing movie. The Egyptians arrive in their starched, perfectly tailored uniforms and throughout their short adventure, the uniforms show not a crease nor a smudge. In contrast the Israeli town they stay in looks ugly and worn. The Israelis are all sad and worn also. Obviously one cannot help but feel a certain tension between the Egyptians and Israelis, although there is no mention of this in the film at all.I am sure that a message is in there somewhere, but it is difficult to decipher it. Is it that all of us are the same . . or that the Egyptians are more concerned with appearance than with reality . . or that the Israelis are kind and gentle despite their outward appearance?"
5,It's good to be square!,"I recently bought what I thought was a good 4' level - it had a ruler along the top, but then while building a deck, the thing fell on the dirt, and to my disappointment, all the level tubes poped out.For a replacement, I wanted to buy the best I could find in the stores, this Empire e70.48 was the only one that all of them on display were consistent - the others in the store were all slightly off when reading the same smooth surface in the store. The blue dye in the level tubes makes reading the bubble easier, even from awkward angles, while I do not intend to drop this one from my deck, I have no doubts that the connections surrounding the tubes are secure. Since I needed it immediately, I paid an even $50 plus tax at Home Depot, and it did not come with the case, so Amazon has a good deal here. Also, as an architect, I must say, this level just looks cool too :)"
3,2 Keys with 4 Locks- A shame,"Master padlocks are master padlocks. They work as anticipated. Keep them oiled and they'll work forever. Why, if I buy 4 padlocks do they not supply me with 4 keys? Cheapskates."
1,Much better quality ones found on the market!,"Not as comfortable as the original. Spend a little more and buy one that lasts, I will next time."
4,The Myth of Baubo,"In ""The Metamorphosis of Baubo"" Winifred Milius Lubell painstakingly tracks the Baubo myth from Paleolithic times to the middle ages. The most popular reference to Baubo has been in Homer's ""Myth to Demeter"" where Baubo appears as a nurse named Iambe and manages to make Demeter laugh. Baubo symbolizes the powerful forces of female sexual energy. This force originally seen as a sacred and essential part of human existence was gradually demonized and by the middle ages was transformed almost beyond recognition. Sketches and photgraphs of the ancient images, along with Lubell's informed narrative offer a revealing glimpse of how female sexuality was revered rather than trivialized as it is today in the media and popular culture. The renowned Marija Gimbutas writes a short but succint preface to this well-written book."
4,Tex,I selected this for my class of high school reluctant readers--mostly boys. They could not put it down which speaks for itself. They had all read The Outsiders a year or two before and said they liked Tex just as well. I thought it was better than The Outsiders myself. It definitely captured their interest and held it.
2,Ritual of the Savage / The passions: Les Baxter,"This is a two album collection with ""Ritual"" being a good exotic junglethemed recording. I could do without album #2 ""The Passions"". If youenjoyed Yoko Ono's agonized schreeching with the Plastic Ono Band, you'lllove ""The Passions""."
2,"Comfortable, not durable","I bought a pair of these boots last january. Around November the outside of my right foot totally blew out. They were very comfortable but didn't even last a year. If you want a pair of boots for show, these are great. If you want a pair to actually work in, look elsewhere."
1,Still waiting!!,15 days after order and still preparing for shipment? Please answer email requests for update!Homework is due and still no textbook.
1,i used to like adobe...,...then i needed to contact their technical support because illustrator crashes when you try to label layers. they go out of their way to make it as difficult as possible. no email support. instead you have to ring an area code 206 number and wait until some overworked undertrained person tells you to reinstall the product or the operating system... very helpful. just like their software.i'll look elsewhere the next time i look for an illustration package or a graphics editor. and i won't even bother discussing their inept page layout program.
2,Better Pocket Books Out there,"This book is way overpriced @ $7.50. It lacks any detail whatsoever and is written at 1st year medical student level....really. Save your money and get the Tarascon critical care pocket guide, that will give you more bang for your buck."
4,An ICU Companion book,"Contains important topics needed in the ICU like : Admission, Orders, Diagnostics, common complications, theraputic drug levels and others all in outlines. help you to remember critical things in the ICU."
1,"Revision, please!","The book does a good job in presenting some credit risk models, although it is far from being exhaustive. However, if you are looking for technical details, you best bets are still the original published papers, given the numerous typos. My suggestion: wait for the revised edition!"
5,Absolutely worth it,"I got this album a few months ago, and I love it. Some of the hymns aren't in a style I generally go for, but they've grown on me. Most of them were moving and uplifting from the start. The messages in each are wonderful. Even the soloists, who in my experience tend to ruin otherwise charming songs, are very well chosen and add to the music. I definitely recommend this album.I also have the All-Time Greatest Hits album, I got that one years ago. There are only one or two recordings that appear on both albums, and Sweet Hour of Prayer is a different version on each album, so I would say it's worth getting both."
4,The Sounds of Heaven,"Keep your Amy Grant, keep your Carmen, keep your Twila Parris - When I get to Heaven I want to hear Ernie Ford and this back up Choir! These grand old hymns and spirituals make me feel the presence of God."
5,An exceptional book,"I have owned this book since it came out in 1965 and I have never found another comparable to it as far as etiquette is concerned. Of course, nowadays things have become somewhat more relaxed but the basics are all there and can be quite helpful to those who have had little experience."
5,Most Excellent,"This book was really interesting. Unlike other books, this one is based on scientific evidence. It's realistic and you don't feel like you're being unnatural or out just to score when you read, say, the Louis, Copeland's How to Succeed with Women. It's about knowing what women really want and think. It gives you a lot to think about and you feel as though you already have a head start just by being a male. I learned a lot and most of it makes sense. The writing is a bit stilted (because of the phD), but you get used to it. Examples and excerpts from his patients (I don't know how authentic they are) were helpful. The book should be really titled, How to understand women and using it to hook up with them in a wholesome way. Highly recommended of all other such books."
1,Don't buy it!,"Actually, I am amazed by the fact that there are few positive reviews. In my opinion this book is absolutely useless. Do not waste your money and time."
1,PUUUUULEEEEEZZZZZZ..!,"How this turd won an oscar for screenwriting is beyond me. The guy preaches, and preaches, and preaches, then becomes president, then preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, becomes a widower, preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, remarries, preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, and preaches, then leaves office. The End."
4,Excellent!!!!!!,I learned so much about this president and our history through this movie. I have lots of gratitude and respect for President Wilson. I highly recommend this historical documentary like movie.
2,"Pointless, unhappy, a downright waste of time.","I watched this movie because I was curious to know if Mike Myers would be able to do a serious role. He did turn his humour off but his character was too boring and had no in-depth consideration at at all.The movie is about an Irish boy and his younger siblings going through a tough time in their lives, recently recovering from the loss of their parents. After a meteor ends up in their backyard, they conclude that it's a gift from their parents and go to an extrordinary effort to retrieve it after a dopey scientist takes it away for study.The film lacks character and has no message at all. It was a sad movie with odd parts, and had no potential at all; I was completely ashamed with it. And why the young boy named the meteor 'Pete's Meteor' is utterly trivial; what did Pete have to do with it anyway?"
2,Pointless design,"I received these locks without the coating on the shackle.I contacted Master Lock and was told that the retail versions of these no longer have the coating on the shackle.What is the point of the rest of the coating if the shackle still rusts? Very dumb business decision.If I had paid full MSRP, I'd be returning them."
2,Not worth the time,The topic mentioned in the book's title probably only comprises about 20% of the book. That part is very good. The rest is a story about an up and coming football player. The problem is that there is no end to the story. It is still being written. This story could have been told in a 5 page magazine article.
3,Hard to follow,Hard to figure the theme. You get into the story of Oher and then get bumped to a history of Bill Walsh and then back to Oher and then Lawrence Taylor and then Oher and then Steve Wallace? Too hard to follow.
3,Misinformed,"My local newpaper had an article about this book. The article led me to believe the book was mostly about the life of Michael Oher. I was interested in learning how a boy who was basically living on the streets came to become an expectional athlete. Unfortunately I found the book to be half about the game of football and half about Michael Oher. Although football has become Michael's life I didn't care to learn about the game of football in this book. I was also disappointed in the ending, however as a result of reading this book I will continue to keep tabs on Michael's football career through the internet. Perhaps someday there will be a sequel to ""The Blind Side"" that will continue the story of Michael Oher and his college and professional career."
4,The Blind side,"There were a lot of differences between the book and the movie, but I really liked both. Sometimes the book went into too much detail but overall it was great."
3,Good football book,Was expecting the book to be more like the movie. If you are really into football this is the book for you.
5,Awesome.,"I'm not much of a football fan. Don't watch many games on TV. Nevertheless, Michael Lewis has written a book I couldn't put down. The intersecting stories of the Left Tackle position, and the destitute Memphis school boy, Michael Ohr, who finds a home with a family of white born-again Christans is extraordianry. I'd read Lewis's book about Billy Beane and the Oakland Raiders so I knew I was in for a good story, well told. The Blind Side exceeded my expectations."
5,"Fantastic Book, Fantastic Writer","I loved Michael Lewis' Moneyball, and per the suggestion of a friend I picked up The Blind Side. While Moneyball was excellent, The Blind Side may have just topped it.Michael Lewis has a gift for being able to tell a story in a way that explains the basics of an idea and makes it fascinating to learn about. Prior to reading this book, I would have classified myself as a casual NFL football fan; However, after reading Lewis' account of the evolution of the left tackle, it completely changed both the way I think about and watch the game.As if redefining the game of football wasn't enough, Lewis also has taken a character in Michael Oher and created one of the most interesting, unlikely, and moving stories I have read about. Oher's story gives a sense of hope that by being surrounded by special, caring people, there is no limit to what one can accomplish.A great book, easily one of the best I've read all year."
5,The Blind Side,"This is a true story of a young man, the family that ""adopted"" him and his bright future because someone cared. It is true and it also gives you some serious insight into the second highest paid player on any NFL team. What position that is will probably surprise you. If you like inspriational true stories, and/or are a football fan, you will find this story fascinating and surprising."
2,"Watch the Movie, skip the book","I wanted to read the book because there usually is more information contained in a book than in the movie based on the book & it ends up being better for it. Unfortunately the book wasn't better than the movie. There was way too much rambling explanations of the importance of former NFL players & coaches and, for extra added fun, these stories seemed to just be randomly stuck into the book in between chapters depicting Michael's life. I guess if you wanted to know the history of football, this would be a good book for you. If you want to know more about Michael than was depicted in the the movie, I guess you're out of luck."
5,football,If you like football and a great story too you will like this book. I loved it as I like the above.
2,Tedious and unclear,"This book is not a great value. It does not explain German grammar with the clarity found in April Wilson's ""German Quickly"" or even Sandburg and Wendell's ""German for Reading."" It is particularly weak when explaining prepositions and the extended adjective construction, and it does not give pragmatic advice about figuring out the various crucial elements in a German sentence. Moreover, the exercise sentences are dull, and not worth the effort needed to translate them. This book is a classic mainly because German teachers are too lazy to seek out substitutes."
1,Not recommended for a Novice!!!!,"Under no circumstances will I recommend this book for first time learners of the German language. Its poorly structured and fails to thoroughly introduce nerw learners to german grammar. If one has a background in German, then the book will be good for them but if one desires to learn for translation purposes, then this book is not for you. Furthermore, i was alarmed at the inclusion of very many imperialistic german passages....!!!"
2,Not vegetarian - Vegan,"If you are looking for a low cholesterol vegetarian cookbook this is not the one. The recipes are vegan. They use no eggs or dairy products, which kind of makes sense in the low-cholesterol way, but then they shouldn't advertise it as a vegetarian cookbook."
1,Not a good one,"I was very disapointed by this book. I have been working with pyrography & gourds for many many years now, & always look for a technique I might like better than what I am using. I wish I had seen the reviews first before buying, I am VERY sorry I bought this & will hold my other thoughts to myself. I DO recommend an excellent book for wood burning, PYROGRAPHY WORKBOOK: A Complete Guide to the Art of Woodburning, by SUE WALTERS. For growing gourds: GOURDS IN YOUR GARDEN, by Ginger Summit. For many beautiful techniques to enhance your gourd art: THE DECORATED GOURD: Beautiful Projects & New Techniques, by Dyan Mai Peterson."
5,Great ottoman for the money,"I purchased this ottoman as a replacement for two previous storage ottomans that I had purchased for more money. The first ottoman's fabric was wearing and the stitching was coming apart. The second ""replacement"" ottoman arrived defective from the manufacturer. I had enough of fabric ottomans. I thought I would try leather. So the search began... local stores to the internet prices from $150 - $1,400. I admit I was very nervous but after reading the reviews I decided to take a chance. I'm glad I did, we are very happy with the ottoman. It is harder than our old pillow top fabric ottoman - but I think I like it better. It is more versatile. The kids sit on it, have snack on it - oh and if they spill I just wipe it up with a damp cloth. For a different look sometimes we put a throw over it. We are very satisfied."
2,Not their best,"I can't believe this was the followup album to ""Pendulum"". ""Pendulum"" is an absolute classic that stayed in my CD changer for years. Great lyrics, musical, memerable and showed great promise of things to come from this duo. ""Scratch at the Door is quite a let down. The first five songs are okay but the rest of the CD seems as though they were under preasure to complete a CD in 24 hours or lose out. Five of the tracks pretty much sound alike but "" Happy Birthay to u"" should never have been recorded....horrible. Lets see what they can do next!"
4,Does not stimulate all 344 pressure points as claimed,"Maybe Dr. Yoo lost count, or maybe he confused a tingling toward the medial nerve with stimulus to an ulnar receptor. In any case, the device only stimulated 338 of the 334 pressure points advertised - this may be the reason other customers have had difficulty with organ regeneration."
2,controls were annoying,"Going left to right was not happening with me. Maybe I'm missing something, but trying to turn and move around was a bit clumsy. So clumsy that I lost interest in the game really fast."
5,psp twisted metal head on,It is awesome better then any of the other twisted metal games before it trust me i own the one for the orginal playstation
3,OK game:not amazing,"I recently rented this game and at first i was pretty impressed. The graphics were great and I quickly became comfortable with the controls and the theme of ultimate destruction. But after the initial shock wore off, I regognized some problems. The story really has no plot(all you do is blow up the enemy cars-nothing else), and the replayability is not good. After having the game for 2 days, I began to get bored. Overall, this game has good points and bad points, so I recommend a rental."
2,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed by Casey's story. After falling in love (and lust) with the other men of the Buckhorn series, I was hoping for a really great conclusion to the series. Unfortunately, Casey's story did not live up to my expectations. I found the plot very contrived and the love scenes were quite static compared to Lori Foster's other novels. I probably would have enjoyed the reading a lot more if 'Casey' had followed the format of the other four from the series. In short, the book was way too long for such a poorly fleshed out story. Sorry."
3,no botton to file drawer,"Winsome Wood File Cabinet with 3 Drawers, HoneyWell the cabinet is nice enough, but if you want to store anything except files in the large drawer, then you will need to cut plywood to make a bottom and sides - because this has neither."
1,Don't bother to order this product unless you want substantial grief.,"We ordered this product which came quickly but was damaged. A replacement was sent and it was also damaged plus some parts were missing. We didn't think it would do any good to send it back so we requested replacement parts from the manufacturer. It will take 4 to 6 weeks for them to get here. If we ever get to use it, it might be a nice piece. We'll see."
2,Hoping missing part arrives soon,"The wood (some sort of soft wood) is not uniformly sanded or varnished. Streaks in the varnish are evident from about 2-3 feet away and the surface is rough to the touch. Assembly was more tedious than anticipated since the milling quality is also poor. Assembly of one of the drawers was not possible without first using a chisel to expand the grove that holds the drawer bottom. Also, one of the two long rods for use of the file drawer with letter sized hanging files was missing from the package. Since the file drawer does not have a bottom a missing long rod is a big deal because the drawer is completely useless unless you have/intend to use legal size hanging files."
5,3 Shelf bookcase,This 3 Shelf bookcase was just what I was looking for. The finish was just right & it fitted great in the corner of my living room
5,Lock up all of your worries,"I have been using a lock with a key for the past several years for my gym locker. The shabby condition of the lock prompted me to put a new one on my wish list from amazon.com. Father's Day rolled around and I received the lock as a gift. I must say that it is one of the best locks I have ever had.The numbers are very easy to turn which is usually not the case with number-type locks. The ease of turning is due to each number having a small prominence which juts out for easy grabbing onto. The lock itself has a large circular loop ring so that it can be placed through most any hole for lockage. The combination is resettable to allow you to change it if you would like. When the lock combination is set for open, the latch releases easily without sticking.Overall, this is a very light, simple, user-friendly, functional lock that fits anywhere to lock up your valuables. No worrying about a key, this lock can travel with you whereever you go to keep all of your worries at bay."
5,GPN is what I like about Texas,"What a great collection of GPN tunes. Being a displaced Texan living far from home in the Mid-South, this GPN cd takes me home. Gary is one of, if not the best song writer in Texas, maybe even the USA. You get your monies worth with 18 cuts. Every GPN cd tells a story and this cd is no exception. I think it is one of his best."
5,(aka Heftig og Begeisteret),"I love this movie.perhaps it's because I lived in Finnmark, where it was filmed.perhaps it's because I wandered Berlevg with some of those guys and they treated us to ice cream.the scenery is beautiful, the guys are hilarious, and the singing is usually wonderful. (only on a few songs are they slightly out of tune)"
4,Nice Shoulder Rest,My wife is very happy with this. She has a violin that her grandfather made and used as his fiddle. She wanted something that would not hurt it or ruin it in any way and we found it with this Kun shoulder rest. It is a good buy at any cost.
5,Kun Super--one of the best.,"I am a professional violinist and teacher for over 35 years, and have used Kun for many years. A few years ago Kun upgraded the composition of the feet--they now last longer than the pad itself. A Kun will stay on well if one mates the feet to the instrument carefully and tilts the pad to the slope of one's shoulder. I prefer the Kun Super for its 'continuous' adjustability."
4,One of the best historical anthologies...,Cahn's text was a requirement for a historical-introduction to philosophy class that I had. Cahn has included much relevant material from key philosophers from Plato and on. I highly recommened this book over Pojman.
5,Intro To Philosophy,"I'm a college student and was required to buy this book (among several) for my Intro to Philosophy class. As soon as the semester was over I did what I always do: sell the text books back to the campus book store. As I went on to other classes I began to regret selling back this book. I'm a few weeks into ""Humanities in Western Tradition I, and I'm currently reading just fragments of what can be found in this book. After I get done with an assignment, I want to read further and if I had kept this book I could do that. So I'm buying it again...for the last time."
3,Not for budding ballerina's,"I enjoyed the book because Margot lead a fascinating life. And I didn't know about the end of her career and life. But I believe most readers choosing to read about Margot are not interested in her sex life. Particularly not interested in lewd statements of her prowess from any past lovers. I would have loved to recommend it to my daughter because Margot is a wonderful role model, but the sexual references make it inappropriate and I would instead recommend her Autobiography."
5,Self-Taught Made Easy!,"I participate in a ""Math Lab"" at my college - an independant study style of learning; and this was the book assigned to the class. With only a rudimentary understanding of Trigonometry, I was able to finish the class in only two weeks, with a 97 average!This book is clearly written, and explained the ""why"" behind the operations - something other Trig books do not. I highly recommend it to people who are having trouble with Trig. I was able to move on to a more advance Trig class - one that I had previously struggled to complete - and finished it with ease."
3,Haha,These locks are neat but can easily be opened if you are patient and pull on the top while spinning the wheels one at a time.
2,Works sorta but not a TSA lock,This lock is only good for local travel if you use this on a airline they will cut it off because it is NOT TSA approved. I was able to pick the lock rather easily buy pulling on the clasp and rotate the dials until I felt a click
2,Look for something better,"Bought these locks for travel on a cruise and 1 of the locks in the pack broke and could not be opened. The construction is very poor and the mechanisms do not move very smoothly, look for something better."
2,Too cheap,I decided not to use them. They looked like a toy lock for a girls jewelry box. I ended up getting a more solid lock
1,NOT TSA Approved - althought the description says it was,These locks do NOT carry the TSA approval and do not have a way for TSA authorities to open them. I had to go out at the last minute and buy approved locks before my trip!
5,"Great, powerful, fun playing","Jessica Williams, contrary to another review posted here, is a WONDERFUL solo pianist--energy, imagination, verve, and highly-developed musicmanship.I say this as a professional pianist in Atlanta, with 10 CDs of my own out in the market. Jessica's playing here is strong and powerful, fun to listen to--and I always find many things that I wish I could play nearly as well.If you like non-restrictive solo piano--that is--playing that transcends narrow stylistic limits--then you'll like Jessica Williams, and this album."
2,Titles might be misleading by Tevfik Aksoy,"The book is based on ex post iteration of events and investment strategies, which lacks the necessary foundation of macroeconomic introduction. It requires extensive knowledge of macroeconomics and finance in order to grasp (or digest) what the ideas behind strategies are. Clearly not for a beginner but I would not recommend it for an experienced fund manager at all. I found most of the examples and strategies highly simple."
3,excellent early fusion,"This is really two releases in one. The first half is studio recordings from 71 and 72. Zawinul and co. keep the energy level high enough to force your breath back down your throat on Unknown Soldier (NOT the Jim Morrison song, but with chilling voices) and The Moors with Ralph Towner on wonderful 12-string. The other two tracks, Crystal and Second Sunday in August, aren't quite there but cool things down for the second half. Starting with track 5 the CD is excerpted from the excellent Live in Tokyo set which has yet to be released domestically. Unfortunately much of the flow of said Japanese-only release is lost in the editing room, nevertheless the reader would do well to pick up both CDs."
1,TERRIBLE IS TOO NICE A WORD!,"I received this CD for free and all I can say is, THANK GOD!!!! This is one of the most irritating albums I have ever had to endure!!! Honestly, I can't give a complete review, as I have never been able to complete the entire album. I keep it close to remind me what happens when musicians start to pander to the musical morons out there who feel repeating the same bass line for seven minutes and knowing how to program a drum machine are the ultimate in musical ability! Apparently all you have to do is throw in some funky sounding temple bells (check out the song Bali High) and you've got something that's danceable. High points on this album are few (read nonexistent). The guy monotonously repeating ""Progress thru chemistry in California living,"" is entertaining for about 12 seconds. If you like your music to have a painfully repetitious quality this album is for you. All others should steer clear! I mean it!"
5,Its Finaly here,"i am an owner of both the ds and the PSP. To be honest the PSP is way better. Although it is much more comlicated. The DS is good and all, but it just doesnt compare. The PSP has eveythingand more. You can watch home videos, movies, play game and share games, and listen to music.If you have or buy the PSP i recomend buying save screens, a memory card(512 should do), and a better case.Although there arnt that many games out ALl the other things should keep u busy. I cant wait till Star wars 3 the game comes out, also Battlefront, and Splinter Cell. me and my brother each have one and they r great. However they are very fragile so u have to be very carfull.Overall its great and..... U should buy it."
1,1/2 A SCREEN OF DEAD PIXELS,"Okay, I hate the PSP. I was liking it, until after 1 day when most of my pixels went dead and one of the buttons got stuck. SAVE YOUR $250 BUCKS BUY MORE GAMES FOR YOU PS2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,a kids review,I dont have one but my freind does first it is portabel but its so expeneseve you wouldent bring it anywhere. seconed its plasma so it will break in about 4 years.and third it has all the games that a regular ps2 has and if you wont bring it anywhere then your better of buying a regular ps2 or a ds or an xbox or a gameboy micro or a gameboy advanced or a gameboy advanced sp
1,dissapointed,"The product its self is really quite spectacular, diversity in its abilities are spellbinding indeed. However, where the machine faulters is in the execution of many of its other functions, its not the best MP3 player, the memory cards are far too small for substancial storage, hence causing the owner to erase and uplaod things over and over again. As a game system though it is quite nice, but nothing spectacular, once you get over the initial wow factor you will notice many of the games are lackluster mini versions of their big brother's counter parts.I had to return this item five times until ultimately receiving a refund, mine always seemed to have dead pixels, or button problem. My advice is to wait for the next batch of corrected systems to hit the market, perhaps a year down the line Sony will have improved battery technology as well making this system a very very good purchase."
2,Simple Rules in Life,"Never buy first generation Tech products.Never buy first year models of cars.Always wait for software versions 2.0Unfortunately, there is just so much testing that a manufacturer can do. Only we consumers can provide sufficient stress testing to determine product viability. Sony is not the 'bad guy' - their R&D; guys were involved in the 'rush to marketplace' syndrome. Wait for PSP 2.0."
5,"wait, I'm here again with something to tell you!","See it to believe it... blah blah. The PSP is awesome.BUT HERE IS AN ALERT!Some people say that Upgrading to System versions like 2.60 and 2.80 fries your PSP! Be sure to have your receipt, if you're planning on doing an upgrade.I've gotta say my PSP is version 2.60, and it works perfectly. Take care of yours, if you have one. And talk to Sony Customer Support if yours is crap! BE CAREFUL WHEN UPGRADING TO PSP SYSTEM VERSIONS LIKE 2.60 AND 2.80!!"
1,NOT HAPPY WITH YOUR PSP,The psp stopped working within a week.I was very disappointed even more so after I returned it for a refund which you don't give back in full.I will never purchase any PSP items from you again.This is my first really issue with amazon.
1,Not durable!,"I'm honestly suprised that the PSP is made so undurable. I have heard many stories about dead pixels and dropped PSP's that no longer function. You would think that Sony would make it a little more durable. Too bad, I think this could have been a good system, but it is definitely overpriced anyway."
2,cool..... But DS is better!!!!,"Get the DS!!!!This thing is cool.....but DS let's you play games that are on the n64, only portable!!!!!!I'm not against the PSP, but i think the DS is the best thing nitendo has ever made!!!!(ima BIIIIIIIG nintendo fan)NDS ALLLLLLLL THE WAY!!!!!!!!"
1,psp...is sony the new sega?,"ds vs psp...clear winner nintendo ds.psp:advantages: prettier graphics, plays a tiny selection of umd movies and musicdisadvantages: no games, short battery life, costs as much as a non-portable game system (249.99)ds:advantages: great games like castlevania ds, jump superstars, advance wars dual strike, meteos (with equally great ones coming like zelda, new super mario bros, etc.), long battery life, plays all the great gba games, in late 2005 will play (with the introduction of the play-yan) mpeg movies and mp3s. has great sound, a touch screen, and a microphone. developers are making tons of games for the ds, as nintendo has proved that it is the unquestioned king of handheld gaming. is cost effective, with many packages costing only 129.99 and you get super mario 64 or nintendogs.disadvantages:"
1,DEAD PIXEL'S!!!!!,"I bought this thing like many other fools on the launch day and mine had 3 dead pixels, to alot of people this might not bother them but $300 is alot of money to me so I returned it to best buy and I had to lie about what was wrong with it to get a new one because if it has dead pixels they won't exchange it. well the one I exchanged it for also has dead pixels, 3 in the lower right corner and one smack dab in the middle!!! so today I will try to exchange it again and will continue to do so until I get a good one. I think sony knew of this problem with alot of the units but desided to release them anyway in hopes that people would not notice the dead pixels. well good luck with yours people."
3,"Awesome portable system, but with major flaws that earn it a 3 in my book","Its really a shame that such a good piece of equipment can be so faulty. The PSP value pack I bought, it looked good at first, then I noticed 2 dead pixels. They're only noticeable during a dark screen and not during gameplay, but then a blue one popped up. And it is just always there, it won't go away... Then today I noticed dust beginning to collect UNDER the freaking screen!... what the hell was SONY thinking when they released this?This would be the perfect portable gaming system if it wasn't for such problems, and now I'm thinking I shoud've got a DS. It isn't as powerful, but at least I don't have to worry about such issues... I should've listened to myself when I said not to buy this because of all the negative reviews. I considered the problems to be the exception, and not the rule, but I was wrong..."
3,Expensive Advertisement,"I agree that the playstation portable looks great and is an overall good machine. But here's the problem I see. You get the playstation portable for $250, then you buy the accesories for $25 like the a case and cover screen, that's now $275, the you buy a couple of games for $50 each, thats now $375, then you buy a bigger memory stick, $70 for 512mb, or $200 for a 1Gb. Lets go with 512. Now you are at $445. Then you want 3 movies to play on it for $30. The original $250 you spent has now turned into $635. Plus all the new games and movies extra you want to buy adds up to more than $800. I just see this as a waste of money. I know I'm probably going to be shouted at by all you PSP lovers out there, but it took me an offer of actually getting it more than dreaming about it to realise this. Hopes this helps people."
5,Don't want to be a Nintendo Idiot!,"I know that Greenday wrote American Idiot, but I wrote a song about Nintendo and changed the words around a little bit. It goes like this.Don't want to be a nintendo idiot.don't want want system that looks like a peice of ****.Hey can you hear the sound of my PSPThe subpliminal my **** NintendoWelcome to a new kind of systemall across Nintendo nations, where everything is meant to be a peice of ****.Super mario dreams of tommorowSony's not the one meant to followand that's enough to argueI think that you're the fagot nintendoI'm not a part of your mario agendaNow everybody do the propagandaAnd sing along with the age of playstation portable."
1,PSP? More like POS,"Right out of the box, this thing had 7 dead pixels!!! I would have replaced it with another one but i hear that most of them come like that. What a ripoff! I kept hearing all of these stories about how great this thing looks, but how can you tell when it comes with dead pixels? I lost all faith in sony products. NOT recommended."
4,too expensve,"ok.first of all i am 14 i just do not want to sign in to amazon. anyway. the PSP is awesome! graphics are great but the price is what really made me mad. i mean its just a piece of plastic with metal. wires. and lights. its not a 24K diamond ring. and also i thought it was ""portable"" the battery will only last about 4 hours hardly enough for a car trip. overall it is a great video game but if you want a longer lasting battery i suggest getting the DS."
4,Nice,I like the ds and the psp but id have to go for the psp on this one. the only bad thing about it is that it costs $250 and the ds only costs $130. Otherwise its great.
1,Waste of money,"You are wasting your money if you buy a PSP. Sure it looks decent but the construction is very flawed, there have been reports that the buttons constantly sick, analog nubs falling off, and the discs shooting out of the tray when the PSP was twisted very slightly (which we all do when we get annoyed so this is a problem). With Nintendo confirming that the DS will go online this year with it's games, there's no real reason to buy this and releasing a list of the steller games coming out from Konami, Square-Enix and other companies, I see no reason why to buy this."
2,Nintendo DS Or Playstation Portable your choice.,To me I think the Nintendo DS is a better System instead of the PSP because The DS has more battery Life than the PSP. Despite that I've been looking at other Reviews like every time when someone buys the PSP it automatically Breaks in 1 or 2 weeks so my big favor is Buy The Nintendo DS instead of This stupid piece of crack System.
5,PSP ROCKS!!!!!!,"I just bought a freakin PSP and i can't wait till it gets here. It can do almost anything. You can go on the internet with it, play games, download music, watch movies, even watch tv on that small thing. It is the best gaming system there is. I even think that it is better than the X box 360 only because of the price. The games that i would suggest is Medievil, MLB,and Star Wars Battle Frontier 2. I am not so sure about the dead pixels on the PSP but i am sure that it is the best system so far."
1,I don't understand,"The Sony PSP is a dissapointment. First of all, it looks like it will break very easily. I have dropped my DS on a sidewalk from 5 feet in the air while it was on and nothing happened. It is barely a gaming device. People that like the PSP like it because it is from Sony. That is why the first Playstation was popular. And Sony would not be in the game biz if it wasn't for the big N. Think about that next time you play the so called ""better"" PSP. Plus it costs more. It is also not innovative. You people are crazy. I want something different. Like the DS. The PSP is just a GBA with WAY better graphics and music and movie capabilites. Nothing more than that. Goodbye."
1,PSP From A Gaming Teen's Point of View,"It's sort of good looking, I'll give it that. But, since it doesn't play many games that I would even consider playing, I am not buying this. I'm not so sure that the battery life will be as stable as the GBA SP's. From my own experience with portable devices like this, I'm thinking that the battery life of this thing (UNLIKE the GBA SP) will wittle down after every charge (after all it is jam packed with so much extra stuff). I mean a true gamer doesn't NEED or WANT all that extra stuff, if I wanna listen to music I'll turn on my iPod or cd player. Also, I'm not seeing the ""portable"" side to this Playstation PORTABLE, it's so honkin' big. I don't know about you guys but I'm sticking with the love of my gaming life, my GBA SP, until someone comes up with a portable GAMING device better than it."
3,clear the games you want and throw it away,"when i logged in on gta:lcs game site, i was amazed with the trailer. i think ""im gonna buy psp!!!"" but then i thought ""i think this is the only game of psp that i want... oh! wait, i also want lumines"" so i though of that and said NO. because the only reason i COULD buy a psp is for lumines and GTA. NOT for music, NOT for movies, NOT for internet, just for lumines and gta. i have a ds, and im saving for approx. 9 games for ds, but on psp, i like only 2. and i think a person buyin a console or handheld only for 1 or 2 games is stupid, so i decided not buying psp, because, after i clear the games i want, what else i can do with it??"
3,Terrible...,"I cannot believe I spent 300$ on this... A couple of weeks ago I was always dreaming about the psp. Now I got it and I regret it. I dont know about other people, nut i would rather buy a ds. Its just a Slicker GBA. I dont think there are people that would rather have a music/movie playing brick in their pockets. I mean sure, it is cool, but I this machine should be priced 200$ cheaper.P.S. IF your Psp ever gets frozen, Close it, open the battery, close the battery. Sheesh.. What a lousy piece of junk."
5,BIG lie,Theres no such thing as a graphic enhancer. If that was true you would see it on gamespot.com so theres no hope for DS.
1,The PSP sucks!,"The only games for the PSP are violent/sports games. And the movies you can watch on it are stuff like shark attack movies! No, I'm not kidding! The Nintendo DS is so much better. Don't waste your money on this expensive PSP, get a Nintendo DS."
2,Not for gamers,"It has many features, true. But if you want to watch movies, watch it on your big flatscreen TV. If you want to play music, use your iPod. If you want to play games, buy the DS.I think the makers should have concentrated more on making this a GAMING PLATFORM. This is a case of trying to cram too much into one tiny little piece of machinary...everything turns out mediocre."
5,Good system.,"If you are planning to buy this product and dont know what game to buy, buy Socom FTB, the headset and a wireless router. That's all I have to say."
5,Eh,"You know whats funny? All the kids reviews have low ratings because when they drop it, it seems to break. Duh, oh my Psp broke when it threw it on the ground! stupid faces, the PSP is not a kids toy. Anyone under 13 will blow it up within a day. For any kid who has this problem, you, and only you are responsible, NOT SONY! I personaly own a psp, and with proper care and use, it will not break.-R2Z0"
1,GET GAME BOY MICRO,Why won't sony give up on makeing hand held nintendo will always win. I mean look at the new game boy micro it is doing better then game boy advance and game boy sp wow that is alot for a psp fan. Just get a game boy micro
3,No Title,"The PSP, wow, it dosen't need much introduction, the Playstation Portable is considered the ultiment gaming maching.Their partially right, you can play music, watch a compact DVD, and of course play games.The music is just like an MP3 player, except you can't save music like an MP3, or an i-pod. You need to put a special disc in(just ask your store clerk). DVD is pretty much the same as watching it at a theater, just on a 3 by 4 screen.The 'console' is pretty small, not a Gameboy size, but it fits in a pocket. For gaming, it dosen't have many buttons, but a lot of sound fx's buttons near the bottom.Latly, theres a big drought of good qualite games, Death Jr. is a sad, button-mashing game. Don't buy it, if you have, sell it.I'd say, wait tell the price goes down, then buy it. Strangly, Sony is already making a successor to it.Notable games: Metal Gear Acid, Lumines, Burnout, GTA Liberty Stories.[...]"
3,Fun at first................,But after awhile it gets very boring.You'll find yourself thinking couldn't I have bought this movie as a regular dvd instead of for the PSP. I mean you could either watch it on your 20'' screen or a 4'' screen on the PSP. Also couldn't you buy these games for your PS2....it would be a lot more fun.
3,Too expensive for what you get,"I've been playing this with pleany of games, all with their own unique style, but they all just come out to me just seeming... quirky. Somewhat because the [_] Button is a little off, and the analog stick/nub is somewhat uncofortable, being so low to the system. With movies, you don't have to use these as much as you do with the games, but the video quality is a little lower than a DVD, which is the same price, and the sound quality is much lower on the PSP, mostly beacase the speakers are placed in an awkward place and you have to be just right in front of them to hear them in a noisy place (such as in a car or a plane). THe games are still scarce, and UMDS are losing support. If you want ot play music on it, though, you have to get a bigger memory card, which is another 100 dollars or so down.I recommend that instead of the PSP, you get the DS, which has better durability & button feel."
2,Why Bother?,"listen im not biased or anything just a gamer since 5 so i know what im saying the psp and ds have two major features they are ds: two screens folds to protect (less scratches) an a touch screen Psp: mp3:get an mp3 player memory sticks way to much Movies: by a portable dvd player or laptop pay extra for movies you already have come on Pictures: you really need to look at your pictures constantly get a cell phone with camera compltely unesscary feature heres something that bugs me how can a fps (first person shooter) work on a psp joystick and directional pad are on the same side aim or move your choice and nintendo makes quality mobile games they own the mobile game genre my opinon ds you get quality games super mario kirby and very innovative and just brilliant game concepts psp: newbie lot of power but they dont know how to use it, not great games buy a ds its $100 dollars cheaper games are cheaper and better so its quality and fun or flash and dull you decide"
1,No clamshell design?,It dosen't have a clamshell design to protect the really big screen so it gets scratched fast.
5,COOL PORTABLE TOY,My grandma is hella rich and she bought me 2 psp in case on broke or something.wow this toy is cool and way beyond the average.awesome.nice price.
2,IT IS SOOOOO FRAGILE,The PSP is so fragile i saw a man at the rest area in North carolina with one and he dropped it and most of his pixles died.My friend has one and I am not to fasinated with it.If you r the one who likes to get stuff like this then you must must must take VERY good care of it.If you r the one who doesnt care about it get a DS.
1,Just wasn't what I expected,"I expected this thing to play DVDs, since some of the reviews here say it does. Nope. It plays these tiny little discs that can only be played on the PSP... and they are expensive! I already have DVD movies, I don't need to watch UMD movies. And the games are not very impressive, the GTA game has been done many times already, I don't think we need a new one. The franchise is getting stale anyway. Not a recommended purchase."

1,broken,"this item arrived broken. There was a huge backwards L from the rim near the handle. It was loosely packed in styrofoam peanuts. The shipping and return cost me around 23 dollars. So I was partially refunded for the wok and the ladle. I went to Ross's several days later and bought an Emeril 14"" cast iron wok for 22 dollars. It is heavy, but great.So this cheap item cost me, in shipping, as much as a good wok.Don't buy this item, thank God I was not cooking with it, or I might have been burned.Since it arrived broken, I did not want to take a chance that it would crack if heated."
1,Waste of Money,"I am a pretty savvy buyer and always do lots of research prior to buying something. After extensive research I decided to purchase this one, partly because it was endorsed by some police departments.Using it correctly, waiting 20+ minutes after food and drink, etc... turns out this device is highly inaccurate.I am 220 lbs 6-8' and all the charts say that 4 beers in 2 hours is under the legal limit. Tried this several times after drinking 4 Bud Lights in a 2 hour span and waiting 20 minutes I get reading .21 and other time a .18 which lists a extreme DUI.Maybe it need calibration but to that extreme? Its brand new.All in all this is a waste of money and judging by its readings drinking some night time cold medicine would cause a DUI.Very inaccurate device."
4,Way better then MVP,I first waited for the release of MVP because on consoles it is the superior game.On the PSP it bites.The batter has such a swing delay that you have to swing as soon as the pitcher lets go whether it's gonna be a ball or a strike.The graphics on MLB are also much better then MVP.MLB does not have all the intro movies of the batter walking into the box and all that but how many times do you watch them anyway? I usually watch the first two and then it just becomes a pain in the *** to hit x every two seconds to skip all the worthless stuff.So if you want a great game for on the go gameplay this is the one for you. GO CARDS!!
2,Vicky Bliss Review,Entertaining and very light reading. Not quite what I expected however enjoyable all the same.
3,not as good as first or second Bliss mystery,"This book was not as good as the first or thirdy mystery. It's more like the forth mystery. It was slow and not as interesting. And not as funny either. Anyway, its a Peters book, so its not so bad. You can feel comfortable with it if you like reading her books."
5,Slide soccer game,Franklin slide soccer game is great. we have so much fun playing and perfecting soccer steps. easy to use. great for soccer fans -it can entertain them for a while.
5,True to life action adventure,"This is a very well done tale of a young independent trucker, named Carrol Jo Hummer.You follow him as he tries to fulfill his dream of owning his own rig.Corruption,danger,murder and greed all get in his way."
4,Good Trucking Movie,"A good movie if you remember trying to work in the 70's. A lot of action from the ""Blue Mule"". I can remember when it first came out and still like it today.Kay Lenz was HOT!!"
4,awesome game. . .,"though it's pretty tough at times. will frustrate you a lot during the course of the game. none the less, it's a good solid game."
3,Beautful illustrations but questionable message,"My child and I both enjoy the lush illustrations in this book, but I have an issue with the story's underlying message. Although both Marco and Polo love to travel together and become good friends, they ultimately decide that the should each go back home and reside ""where they belong"". To me, the book implicitly advocates segregation, even though it exists here between a penguin and a monkey."
4,"Superb content, rebarbative style","The book is full of exciting ideas. It manages at once to challenge one's notions of what system development ought to be about, placing it in the context of the history of our field, and confirm what one's experience has (often painfully) taught. But cutting through the style to reach the content is such hard work. The altogether agonising alliteration has me -- from time to time -- physically chucking the book across the room. I suspect that the ambivalent nature of the reviews that have been submitted reflects this dichtomy.Yes, the book is well worth the effort. But a less facetious style would make the effort unnecessary."
5,Excellent,"Personally, I prefered this Disney ""making of"" book to any of the others in the series (Making of the Lion King, Pocahontas, etc.) Although it wasn't as flashily put togethre, it contained heaps more insightful information, and out of all the ""making of"" books it was the only one I thought entertaining and useful enough to actually buy. As another reviewer noted, the only real annoying point was the author's refusal to mention Robin William's name. The reason for this was that Robin Williams was having a dispute with Disney at the time. Still, it's the one place where this book lacks. A brilliant read, and I recommend it highly."
2,Lack of respect for the actor who carried such a good movie,I collect the hyperion 'the art of' series conceirning the disney movies (and dreamworks)and found it terribly annoying tha author never mentions Robin Williams throughout the whole book. Unbelievable when you consider the impact his voice and humor has on the film. I really expected more info on his involvement. Compared to other making-of-books this has the least attractive lay-out and too much info on the historie of the artists. (it is also one of the smallest). Maybe my hopes were just a bit too high.
2,Not worth it,"A rather disappointing book.Mr Ganguly is unable to overcome his bias against Pakistan, and repeatedly harps on India's perceived military superiority over Pakistan.A good book on the issue of Kashmir is difficult to find. Victoria Schofield's Kashmir in Conflict is a good book,but some say that her friendship with Pakistan's former Prime minister Benazir Bhutto makes her a biased writer.Overall,Mr Ganguly has been unable to contain his patriotism while writing this book.I would not recommend this book to first time readers on the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan."
2,This isn't Debbie Macomber's best work,"I love Debbie Macomber so it was hard for me to give this book just 2 stars, but I found the basic premise too unbelievable to enjoy the book. A mercenary ""forced"" to take a young woman into a hostile area b/c she called his bluff? The hero and heroine exchanging snappy reparte and ruminating about love while in the midst of enemy-held jungle? Debbie Macomber writes ""nice"" books that make you feel like there are good people with good values in the world. They are a refreshing escape from the news and from ""serious"" fiction. But this one just doesn't work for me. I don't expect total realism from romance novels but there has to be some plausibility. If you love Debbie Macomber, and can't stand the thought of missing one of her books, by all means buy this. But if you are new to the author, read some of her other work first -- don't judge her by this. It is not up to her usual standard."
1,Sooner or later,Really did not enjoy it. Not what I thought it was to be. Looking for just something light.Oh well.
4,Good reading,"I liked this book once it got going. I had an insite to all the ladies in the book and think each one should have had their onw story to tell. It could have been three different books, because it left me wanting to know more."
5,Horsefeathers,Enjoyable. Love listening to the cd when driving my car. It serves as a reminder to pay attention and go with the flow. Messages are everywhere when we pay attention.
4,"Good beat, and rythm not great lyrics",I really like the beat and rythm in the song Hold Me. The lyrics are not that great. The song is somewhat repetative and the chorus part gets stuck in your head. Overall the song is great to listen to but might get old or boring after awhile.
3,A Gem,The bonus DVD of the Filmore show coupled with this CD is really fantastic. Want Two is one of favs of Rufus' catalogue and to have this DVD bonus is a must.
2,Fabulous music. BIG !,This is fabulous work by an entirely original artist.There are very little talents like this around. Rufus rules !At first i was'nt sure of 'Want 2'..it took only 1 day to grow on me.It's as Fabulous as is his other work.5+*
1,Awful,"I was in Barnes & Noble the other day shopping for booksand they were playing a CD over the store PA system(much too loudly I might add). I had never heard anything so irritating and awful in my life.I walked over to the music section, and found out it was Rufus Wainwright's new CD. I shook my head because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I felt like I was being tortured and forced to listen to the sounds of screeching lab monkeys.Imagine a cross between Dave Matthews and an injured cat that just got hit by a car, and you've got Rufus Wainwright. The guy can't hit a key without sliding upwards toward it, kind of like what we all did in junior high when we were learning to sing.How anyone can like this is beyond me. I ran out of the store without buying anything because after 3 or 4 songs it was just too much to handle.So if you like the sounds of screechign monkeys and dying kittens, this CD's for you."
2,Leftovers from Want One,"I love Rufus's music and although I feel ""Want One"" is his best album; in the same manner its evil twin, ""Want Two"" is his worst. I kind of expected it when I read he cut too many songs for them to fit in one album with the pick of the litter going into the first Want. The only reason to buy ""Want Two"" is the live DVD: a must for any fan.Payeyo GarciaSanto Domingo, R.D."
1,junk,"Don t buy Invicta, they are the worstI bought a watch in special it was 50$After 3 months got water inside, send it back to be repairedwithin the warranty..I got the watch after 3 monthsI was charged for shipping and handling 38$ plus 12.93brokerage fee......no other comments"
5,Just awesome,"Bought this watch about two weeks ago. To start with, Amazon and UPS are awesome when it comes to shipping. Ordered it at 11 pm local time here i Sweden on Thursday. Monday morning at 10 am, the UPS delivery guy rang our doorbell! Its freakin faster than the Swedish postal service.The watch arrived in a nice looking box, The watch itself looks and feels great. Its a big, quite heavy watch (for being a watch with a leather strap) but that just makes it feel rugged and expensive.The 99$ price is a steal!I love it."
4,"THERE""S NO SECRET ! 1","One of the best 80s groups around. One of the best compilations around. Could have gotten the full 5 stars if the dumb record company had put in their best track ""Secret"", seeing as the 1st compilation has been deleted. Dumb dumb dumb. OMD is no more, but their music lives on. Thank you for making my teens and the 80s so memorable. You are up there with the Pet Shop Boys."
3,What's The Point?,"Why would anyone buy this CD? Its missing so many good OMD singles, how can it deserve its title? It disappoints me that Virgin won't release a difinitive collection of OMD singles in a 2 CD collection. Who ever determined this track listing did a very poor job of choosing. ""Dream of Me"" instead of ""Stand Above Me"" or ""Everyday""? Hmmm. As it stands you are far better off owning the older ""Best Of"" collection and the excellent ""Sugar Tax"". If you are going to get this just for ""Walking on the Milky Way"", you may as well pay a few dollars more for the ""Universal"" import. Very questionable release."
5,Great Book,The story in this book is very well written and the art is done great. The story moves pretty fast and this story can be easily completed in one sitting. The Hulk is seen a decent amount of times while the story itself still helps evolve the character of Bruce Banner. I reccomend this book for anyone that's a fan of the Hulk.
3,Huh?,"At the end of reading Minette Walter's ""The Echo"", I was asking myself, ""That's it?"". It didn't really strike me as a real mystery and the plot was boring. The thing i enjoyed about the novel, though, was the narrative style -- using exerpts from newspapers and letters to keep the story going. Narratives within a narrative is an old form of story-telling, and it was refreshing to see it in a modern novel. Another thing that managed to lift the book from its drabness was the triangular relationship between Michael, Terry and the dead Billy. Predictable as Terry's relationship with Michael turned out to be, it gave an interesting dimension to the book. The mirroring in thoughts between Michael and Billy, as well as both their roles as a father to Terry was well though-out. Other than these moments of genius, the novel was mediocre."
3,Missed by a Hair!,"The secret of an English Mystery is that it examines the mundane lives of its actors through the faculties of the investigators uncovering some plot or solving a puzzle. In that sense the book is fabulous in its exposition of the not so typical average upper class people and people and enlightened outcasts as well a despicable villain or two. The novel fails when the principals become overdeveloped beyond the realm of believable. Towards the end of the story the beloved characters become enlightened and sentimentalized into corniness as if the author fell in love with those people, leaving the audience in the cold. The major shortcoming, though, is that everything is tied up neatly with no suirprises and no loose ends by the end of the novel with critical clues pulled out of the hat with no hint for the reader.The book is worth reading , a least 3/4 of it for the imaginative storytelling."
3,Not quite up to her usual standard,"This psychological mystery is good, although it's not quite as good as Walters' other books. It is not short on emotion and intrigue, but I found the whole story to be generally less compelling. This may be a personal preference, but I just didn't care that much about the characters. I did enjoy the various underlying themes (greed, homelessness, etc.) which were quite thought provoking."
1,An un-thriller,"I have to confess, I started the ""Echo"" with a bit of prejudice. Even though I quite enjoyed ""The Sculptress"", there was something suspicious in her previous books. Of course, I did not expect them to measure up to the best British mysteries, but then again, it is hard to compete with P. D. James and Ruth Rendell. But when I was reading the ""Echo"", I could not believe my eyes: a twisted, unlogical plot, stereotypical, cookie cutter characters, phony dialogues, political correctness in all it's ugliness. It got so bad, that in the middle of the book I stopped following the plot and was only able to pay attention to the stitches."
1,Not like Grandma's,My grandmother had a nut chopper that looked just like this when I was a kid. She and I chopped many walnuts together over the years. This is not the nut chopper my grandmother had. The blades bent immediately and did not get the job done. It went right into the trash. Do NOT waste your money on this cheaply made piece of junk.
2,2+ years I know ten phrases.,"I purchased this cd/book more than 2 years ago, and I am still struggling with it today. If you really want to learn a language, I don't think these type of quick and easy CDs work. The marketing behind this CD is that if you listen to it on your 18 hour flight to China, you will be able to speak basic Chinese when you land. -- With general phrases you need to get around in Chinese. I would highly reccommend you not do that. While I have gone through the cd dozens of times, even taken a couple of cross country flights with it, and tried leaving one chapter on for hours, I have only picked up a few phrases, such as Hello, how are you?, and numbers. At this point, I am converting everything to notecards. As another reviewer pointed out, it is basically all blind memorization, and Chinese is hard to memorize. Another note, this CD does not include anything regarding written Chinese only Pinyin."
4,A helpful lesson,"This is a useful tool for picking up a little conversational Chinese fast, especially (if, like me, you are more visual than aural), when used in conjunction with the text that accompanies it."
5,Apology,"Ordered this title through Amazon's used book and for the moeny spent the book is in excellent condition with no problems. I have ordered through them before, new and used and never have had any issues."
5,"Vicky Bliss, Meet John Smythe","The second Vicky Bliss book, this novel introduces us to the suave, debonair art thief, John Smythe. Vicky is intrigued when an amazing jewelry forgery shows up in Munich, where she is working for the National Museum. She decides to travel to Rome to see if she can figure out who is behind this. What she finds is a hotbed of intrigue, forgery and murder.This is my second favorite of the Vicky Bliss novels (my favorite is the last). It is well written and Vicky is a wonderful, liberated woman."
5,Flawlessy funny,A hapless middle-aged midlist author gets embroiled in the British legal system when he is accused of fathering a child and not paying support. You may need a certain amount of anglophilia and interest in the literary scene to fully appreciate it. The only fault I could find was that it's too short. I hate finishing books in one night before I fall asleep.
5,Gospel the Way it Should Be!,"Kirk Franklin, move aside! This is the way the gospel music should be presented, sincere and spiritually illuminating. The Williams Brothers have released a ""live"" recording that captures the essence of faith with an ecletic blend of the traditional and the contemporary. Featuring some of their most popular songs (the smooth and subtle ""Never Seen Your Face,"" the truly uplifting ""Living Testimony,"" as well as the praiseworthy ""For All You've Done""), these gifted gospels artisans have crafted one of the best concert albums in recent years. An outstanding cut is the almost fifteen minute ""Medley!"" If this one doesn't get one ""spirited,"" then there is no remedy for one's ills. I am so grateful to the church ""sister"" who introduced me to these talented musicians several years ago. My music library has been elevated since the induction of this and other releases by the premier gospel group today. The Lord will indeed make a way!"
3,Good for its time,"For the most part, this book has good material that can be applied to todays times, but a lot of the content has to be glanced over since computers make much of the tactics and techniques obsolete. I skimmed over the book and it has some good points on composition and layout, but desktop publishing has made this book close to useless. There are other books today that do a better job in the same amount of space."
4,Clean and Crisp,"For the casual Mclaughlin enthusiast, this is a clean and crisp album that delivers excellent performances by an allstar lineup of jazz greats including a nice solo by Carlos Santana. Although not as intense as some of his other albums, Electric Guitarist is a fine representation of one of the best guitarists of all time."
3,Good but not perfect,"While I have found this book to be of some use in my research, and in creating my web site, I have also found it to be somewhat flawed. First I think it is a mistake to think that Dan McCaffrey is an Historian. As it says on the back cover, at the time he wrote the book, he was a newspaper man. That, does not an historian make.Also, I don't believe a real historian would take something that someone told them was 3rd hand information and present it as proof. He did that in at least one part of the book, and that information comes from a respected air Historian, the Late Phillip Markham.But, I did find some of the information in the book interesting, and helpful in various ways. As long as you're willing to live with printing errors and take this caution, I believe the book is worth the time. Though perhaps not the money."
5,A very valuable perspective,"This book is a valuable addition to our understanding of Islam. It highlights the rich tradition of Islam without unneccesary and misleading reference to ""Orientalist"" literature"
3,Blast from the past....,"Born in the 70's but grew up in the 80's, it was around 1984 that I started to care about music and the late 80's and early 90's that I started to collect it and use it to rebel against the parents like every other teenager. We had a local radio station that decided to try a new format ""alternative"" music. That format lasted a whopping 1 year and struggled the whole time, but I heard some great new music by artists that I never would have heard from on the more popular music stations. One of those bands were Anything Box. Listening to the music now, it sounds kind of packaged and repetitive, but still has a good feel to it. They were a little shallow at the time that this album came out hence the lack of depth to the music and the sounds are very tinney. But still a good listen after all of these years just to pull it out of the collection and pop it into the cd player for a little nostalgia."
1,Not worth buying,"Now that I'm in the classroom, I'm not finding anything I can use in this book. There are work sheets galore that you can download off of the web that are just as interesting."
3,Misleading Title,"So to start off, I'm a high school math teacher. Been teaching for 7 years now. So I do have a lot of experience using various supplemental materials in my classroom.The reason I gave this book 3 stars is mainly because of the misleading title. The activities and ""real world"" applications aren't very impressive and the majority of the book is worksheets. I was expecting in depth project base learning activities.However, as a worksheet book to be used as supplemental practice in class or for HW, this is a great option.So basically this book is useful depending on what you plan on using it for."
2,Misleading Title,"Despite the title's claims to the contrary, this is not a book of activities, but rather a collection of worksheets. Though I expect I will get some use out of it, it is not at all what I expected or what the publisher describes it as. I would also say that its connection to the ""real world"" is no greater than what you would find in your standard problem set. Disappointed."
1,a lock that anybody can pick,This lock lasts about a year before it gets gunked up and won't function. By the way any semi-motivated 14 year old with you-tube could open your Master 175D in ten minutes with a paper clip or a piece of a hacksaw blade. Before you by one check out how hard they are to pick!
1,Poor quality product,I owned this lock for less than a year. I dropped the lock when it was opened and the shackle fell out of the body. I was unable to get it back in. Very disappointed with this product.
1,Awful....,This product came without the key that makes the entire product work...NOT HAPPY.. I will be contacting everyone to not purchase this. I spend thousands of dollars on this website and I will NO longer do this is this matter is not taken care of...
5,Second one of these for me,"This is my second one of these, the first in now about 6-7 years old and works great.Why I like it is the now need for a key and the ability to set your own code, all of which is very easy to do!I even lost my code key for my first lock, all I did was contact master lock online and they were very nice and just asked where to ship the replacement key for free!!!Over all I find this lock to work great and does it's job, I would buy it again and will do so in the future if I need to!"
1,Corrodes in a flash,"Bought 2 of these less than a year ago for my sailboat. Had to cut both of them off, so corroded that they could not be opened. Another beef, the cylinders do not have a stop at the 0000 position which would make it easier to dial in a combo in the dark. Spend a couple dollars more and buy the Sesame, I've had 3 of them on the boat for almost 10 years"
3,"good movies, poor quality","This is a good collection, unfortunately video quality is poor(particularly the films of Lee). The set is worth watching by House on Haunted Hill, which incidentally has good picture and sound."
4,A great place to start ... but not without a little help,"This is one of the best Japanese Grammar books I have bought. The best feature, in my opinion, is the fact that the books does not restrict itself to Romanji (Romanized Japanese writing) or Kana (the phonetic Japanese writing). Instead, all the expressions and vocabulary given is written in both Kanji and Romanji from lesson 1. And there are quite a few lessons (about 40)! So by the end of the book you will be reading page long passages in Japanese!. This may be a bit rough in the beggining (since reading Kanji is hard because each character can be read in *MANY* different ways), and that is why I suggest another book, like Eleanor Harz Jorden's ""Reading Japanese"", since it has many reading drills and will make you more confortable with reading more quickly. The combination of these two books makes the reader very familiar with common Japanese sentence structures and day-to-day Kanji characters. Definetly a great buy!"
4,"Great recordings, but only with the Shaw band","The quality of the recording is excellent. and Ms Forrest's voice and phrasing never disappoint me.One note: I did not realize that this CD was only of Ms. Forrest with the Artie Shaw band, probably due to my not paying close attention. Of course, the only issue with this, is that it only includes recordings from the early part of her career. So just beware."
4,"Good Basic Tool For Pilots, Owners","For an aircraft owner or pilot this is a good basic tool to troubleshoot the most common problems while recognizing the symptoms. It also presents the accepted methods and techiniques of installation to avoid such problems. For the established professional avionics technician or aviation mechanic the book could go further. Therefore I rated the item four stars from the perspective as a pilot, owner."
4,Great massage ball,"This feels very good, and helps the massager because it doesn't tax your muscles, so it is good on both sides."
4,"Good locks, but small","I guess I didn't pay close enough attention when I purchased these, but they are smaller than ""normal"" padlocks -- they were almost too small for what I needed them for. Check out the size before ordeirng and make sure that a 1-1/2 inch shackle is good enough. I think a 2 inch shackle is the more standard sized padlock that I was expecting.But despite the size, they work well. I can't imagine that they are super secure, but for light duty protection they work fine, especially for the price.I wish they included more keys (only 2 are included)"
2,Cheap,"These locks are very cheaply constructed. So cheaply constructed, in fact, that I'm afraid they'd spring open if I stared at them too hard. They do use a very unusual key which would make them really difficult to pick, though. Unfortunately that wouldn't be necessary in the first place: I'm sure even the crappiest bolt cutters would get through these locks easily."
1,had it for 6 months,I used it for bringing data from my work computer to my home and to transfer stuff from different computers in the office. After 6 months the drive started saying it only had 16mb storage capacity and needed to be formatted. I tried formatting it and the same error keeps on coming up. If you buy this get the warranty also
5,Amaizing Price,"I'm very happy with the product, and prompt shipping made it so I got it the day I needed it. Thanks."
5,Brilliant Product!,What is not to like about this product? The price was excellent and the product was easy to use! I have to say that I am well please with this purchase.
5,Kingston Data Traveler,"Needed a 1 gb unit to store designs for my embroidery machine, as it will only read 1 gb or less; getting hard to find these in stores. Performs as it should."
3,"Is what it is, BUT will not work on non-powered hub!","Not much to say here after a week of use. It works as it should and is small and portable.The problem is that it will not work on a non-powered usb hub like my iMac keyboard. I have just upgraded to a powered hub for the iMac (which is hidden behind the monitor), due to the lack of USB inputs on the computer. My old 128 MB ""mini cruzer"" thumb drive works fine off the keyboard USB hub, but not this Kingston, making it almost worthless in my current setup. I would have guessed that a device with no moving parts would be powered off a keyboard. I've learned THAT lesson now!"
3,"good flash, but old mechanical design","The flash is good, writing speed is high.However, when writing lots of small tiny files, it becomes very very slow!!!!! Is it a common problem for all flash memory based USB storage?And the mechanical design... the cap is seperate, so might easily be lost; and there is also no string attached to the drive."
1,Does not work.,I bought this product to transfer files from a specific computer. It does not work. This computer has Windows XP operating system and the DataTraveler works on all other computers/laptops but the one that I bought it for. The driver won't install. I called technical support and they told me I should just return the product.
4,flash drive,this product has served it purpose. I would buy again if need be. I use it all the time. Although I still use a drive 1.44 too with backing it up on this drive I bought.
5,Great Product for a Great Price,"I have used several different types of flash drives and this Kingston has performed and held up as well as any. The price is great, especially for the amount of space available on the device. If you are looking for a quality falsh drive for the lowest dollar, you have found it."
3,Kingston Flash drive,"This item came with poor instructions on how to use it: for the first few days, I couldn't get the cover off. I was afraid to force it, that I might break it. I tried to get help from their web site but was ignored. I guess they thought the question was below them. Fortunately, a friend of mine who is stronger, was able to take the cover off and I could use it."
4,Super deal,"I can't believe how cheap these things are getting. I do think it's funny how styling is getting so ""i-Poddy."" As a PC user I'd prefer black or gray. But at this deal, I won't complain. Works great, and speedily enough."
4,Inexpensive and works like a charm,"This USB flash drive works like a charm and is very affordable. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't think the loop to attach to your key chain seems very sturdy, though it is fine so far."
4,nice.,"Just your regular flash drive. The price at 12 bucks was a bargain compared to the other brands. It's reliable. Had for a month now. No problem so far. Minus one star for the cap which is hard to open. Not sure if its the one for those fussy about speed but it's not been too slow to be a nuisance to me. If you're looking for a simple flash for no hassle data transfer, this is the one to get. I'd buy it again."
1,a terrible flash drive,worked slowly from the start. difiicult to remove and insert. the worst flash drive I have ever purchased.
5,Don't know how I worked without it!,"At my job I don't have a designated work space and I work on about 8 different computers, every time I wanted to save a file that I would need to access frequently I would have to save it, email it to myself,and then save it in my email so I could access it from anywhere. Now all I have to do is plug this in to the usb and save my files to it. It's fool proof, fast, and small enough to put in my purse. It's also convenient in the fact that I have a PC and a laptop at home. I do most of my work on the labtop, but don't have it connected to a printer. I can save my work on the Kingston, plug it into the pc and print away. The price is great too! I highly suggest purchasing this if you work on more than one computer."
4,So far so good,"There are many offerings on the web for cheap memory storage. Kingston is one brand that is an average offering, and it met my expectations. It has a very convenient size and it also looks nice (unlike many cheaper offerings that don't look nice at all). It is fast and so far it is OK for data transfer. I am not giving it 5 stars as I just had it for 1 month, and this kind of flash memory loses capacity over time. That is the only pending item I am looking forward to evaluate. I am happy with the memory overall."
5,Best price I have yet seen,"Best price I have yet seen on a 1 gig (written on 3/8/07) USB stick, but memory prices are always falling. The stick works great, no problems and Kingston has a long history in OEM memory--not so well known to consumers.I like that the Data Traveler is thin because I have a USB mouse for my laptop and it was always pretty tight plugging my last memory stick in next to the mouse.I read one review on this model that said it was ""hard to figure out which side was the top"" ... I don't understand that criticism--the top is the side with the raised ""Kingston"" lettering. The fact that the green indicator LED is under (but it shines through) the logo plastic, as opposed being a visible LED bulb, may have confused people as to which end is up. Like I said, I didn't have that problem."
4,great,It is great! I haven't had any problems with it. My only complaint is that it might be nice if it came with a lanyard or string to attach it to.
4,Sleek Product,"WIth numerous flash drives available in the market, i was tempted by the lower price of the lesser known brands, however I went with Kingston basically because of its name and durability , and i should say i was right. This a sleek product ,probably around 5$ more than the lesser known brands,but i will take it, for you dont want to lose your documents and cherished photos!"

5,Love it!!,"I love this new bath soap and always use it!! it's very cool and smells great. My skin feels great and refreshed! I advise ouy to purchase this, good stuff"
1,Terrible!!!,We were shocked at the amount of bad language used in just a few short minutes of the movie. What could have been a great show was ruined by the language/attitudes/behavior of the kids in the movie. I give this one star only because the review is requiring me to not because it deserves it.
1,Maybe I don't get it,"It've known the music of Mahavishnu for years. Maybe not since 1974, but for a while. And I don't get this album. I never got it, and I still don't get it. I just can't get into this album. Maybe I'm too stupid to get it?"
2,Surprise! It is missing some big hits.,"When you hear ""Box Set"" you expect a complete and amazing collection. Well, this in neither. This album is worth $15 dollars and not a penny more."
5,Great pan,I switched back to stainless steel after going through so many nonstick surface pans. I love it and so happy I made the change. It was an amazing price with free shipping. A little baking soda and white vinegar cleans the pan after each use and makes it like new for the next go around.
4,Transcend yourself to another plateu.,"A little new age for any music collection. Except for a couple melodies this mix is hauntingly wonderful. ""Moods One"" is excellent too."
3,Pretty Good But Nowhere Near As Great as Pure Moods I,"I was so floored by the originial Pure Moods -- I went on the buy the work of most of the artists represented on it. I was hoping for something similar in Pure Moods II. I didn't get it. It's OK but doesn't have the exciting, funky style of the original. I actually like this CD just fine, it's just not up to the task of coming anywhere close to the first."
2,Not as good as the first one!,"No, this is not as good as the first Pure Moods. The only songs I like are ""Mummer's Dance"" and ""Life in a Northern Academy"", other than that I could leave it. It's to bad, #2 could have done a lot better."
4,Pure relaxation...,As good as the first one if not better... Ecstatic music that can almost definitly sooth even the harshest of souls... It is great to lay back and just slip away into another place...
1,Not for developers,"The chapter in this book on Web Parts is well explained and laid out with one huge fundamental flaw; the author can't decide whether he wants to illustrate examples with C# or VB.Net. He'll begin explaining a concept in C# and suddenly switch to VB and vice versa. Regardless of how proficient a programmer you are, this is awkward and confusing. Examples should be done in C#, VB, or both.I understand the desire to cover both VB and C# in a single book, but this awkward attempt to do so effectively produces an inadequate implementation of each rather than a decent implementation of both.Developers seeking to use this book to learn more about building Web Parts for Sharepoint should steer clear. It may be an inadequately documented field, but this book does not contribute positively towards it."
1,"Shoot the Americans - not the chicken and boar, PLEASE!!!!","After having seen this movie, I understand why Europeans, Arabs and everybody else hates Americans... There are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from Kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear.The story idea is great, but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review.Jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he filmed-or really fallen in love with the building. Everytime the story could have taken off we get a stop with yet another look at the building itself.It's a miracle to us, how anybody on here could call this movie funny or entertaining - the movie is bad, pretending it to be a satyre doesn't make it any better."
4,"I've never liked romantic movies, but..","Sassy Girl is different, it has a bit of humor but there is a deeper sense of heart that one feels while watching this film. The acting is pretty good. I dont know if I liked the actor or actress more. I loved the twist, semi-twist, towards the end. I enjoyed this movie and I think Korean cinema has a lot to offer to the world. This was my second Korean film, first being the flabbergasting Oldboy. Watch this."
4,Also a Great Resource for Planning A Used PC Purchase,"For the ""Geek"" inside you. Well written and not overly technical. Every PC owner should have this as their personal System Administration manual."
4,"Yeah, other people singing her songs - so what??","Personally, I liked it. It's not so much different than other tribute albums with other people singing an artist's songs, with different orchestrations, sometimes very different sounding than the original. Blasphemy?? No, that's what tribute albums are usually like. Okay, so some people really hate that kind of stuff, I personally enjoy most of them. Yeah, I expected all intrumental as well. I think some people would be less upset if it was clearer that this particular album was not instrumental like the last one. But I think Enya's music has that timeless quality about it, I enjoyed many of these arrangements...not as much as the originals perhaps, but certainly enough that I am happy I bought the CD."
2,Not what you'd expect,"This album was a complete disappointment. From the other reviews I figured it was Enya was an orchestra and a bit of a Kick. But It sounds like easy listening jazz music from Kenny G. The overflowing voices in harmony that she normally has in her music (her trademark), is gone. If you ever wanted to know EXACTLY what she was singing, buy this album. Storms In Africa (the original) was Fantastic. Enya really changed the style on this one. Instead of the drums and heavy beat you'd remember from that version, you get what sounds like five natives with two woodblocks, chanting 10 feet away from the mic. They are over powered buy a soft harmony on violins. I think Enya went the wrong direction on this. My CD is now a coaster."
3,Band,"I have had this same Timex watch for five years and was very pleased with it. However,the indigo light did not work anymore so I purchased the same watch through Amazon. The box in which it came in was thrown away, thinking it would fit my wrist the same. However, when I tried the watch on the band was so much larger than my last one. The watch swirls around and the face is always on the botom of my wrist, which is very annoying. Next time I will know not to discard the box because now I cannot return it."
2,disappointed,"I ordered a timex watch at a very good price. It came within the specified time, which was very encouraging. I was very disappointed however, when i put it on my wrist. the expansion band was extra-long...an important detail that had not been listed in the description.I returned the watch immediately and want to commend Amazon for their expeditious return policy. I simply filled out the form which they e-mailed to me, brought the packet to UPS and sent it back Postage paid by Amazon. I received confirmation that the watch had been received and that my credit crd would be credited."
5,Sewall sums ED up...,Sewall's forefathers were around when Emily's dad was in politics..I think they were lawyer buddies...you can't own to many of these..
2,I got two keys for four locks; whiskey tango foxtrot.,"I got two keys for four locks and the locks are tiny (Smaller than a gym combo lock). Other than that they seem fine, light weight and very good for luggage or bags, but barely fit a Plano Tough Box.Pros: they lock and unlock and there are four of them, they would deter any 9 year old from breaking into your tool box full of girly mags.Cons: they are light aluminum and can be easily cut, oh and did I mention they came with two keys? I guess the bolt cutter will come in handy later so maybe the light aluminum isn't so bad."
4,I LIKED IT,"This isn't the kind of book likely to get a scholar's respect. It's the type found in grocery stores next to books on UFO's and holistic medicine. With its glossy cover and shocking chapter titles, it can be dismissed as sensationalist, full of inaccuracies and fabricated dialogue.But I actually liked this one. Sure, it lacks the professional writing style of other works, but then it captures the madness in a way those often fail to do. In the end, killer cults are just that-madness. All of the groups from the latter part of the last century to the 90's are included, beginning with Manson and including MOVE, the Branch Davidians and Jeffrey Lundgren. The last chapter is on the infamous Solar Temple of 1994, so Heaven's Gate fans will have to look elsewhere.The greatest weakness here is the failure to follow up on any of these stories. Boyle tells us what happened and then..well time for the next chapter. But perhaps that is what we should expect from this kind of book."
3,Killer Cults,"The book was a little lean on details concerning the various beliefs and teachings of the cults. Other than that, it was a pretty interesting read. I don't feel I wasted my money on this book."
1,A Poor Substitute For MacMillan,"Sure! It's loaded with new age stats(AOPS,ABR,AERA,RNG,BFW).But are you looking to see why Reggie Jackson was called Mr.October? Well don't look under his entry in the Batter Register. As a matter of fact don't look anywhere in this book because players AL/NLCS or World Series stats ARE NOT listed! Want to look up some post season facts? Your search begins on page 1631 and ends on page 1634! No line scores for Playoff or World Series games! The post-season section is no more comprehensive than you would find in the World Almanac! Not what I'm looking for in a Baseball encyclopedia. If you've ever spent an hour or two just getting lost in your old MacMillan encyclopedia flipping back from section to section, don't expect this cheap imposter volume to re-create that feeling."
1,Poor results,"This is the 3rd Diono in 4 months, first one lasted 1 month, and since then every replacement one has only lasted 5 - 7 days at the most."
1,worked once then quit!,"had to drive to Michigan from Alabama so needed a warmer for the car. After reading the unfavorable reviews, I still purchased it, I only needed it for this trip and our family vacation in a couple of weeks. Well, it warmed one bottle very well...it took about 45 minutes, just as another customer said. then, when time for 2nd bottle, the light was on but it would not get warm. So, every 3 hours we were getting hot coffee from a gas station. I do NOT recommend this product. I wasted 10 bucks and some change!"
3,NOT Compatible with KX-TG704B Phone System,"Panasonic KX-TCA200 HandsetEven though the product is described as a handset, I knew I was purchasing a backup power supply. The problem is, it doesn't work with the new phone system I purchased at the same time, even though the Panasonic packaging indicates that it should! The plug does not fit the jack on the phone. Fortunately, I purchased this phone system to supplement an older Panasonic system, to give me handsets in more rooms, and the power supply does work with the older system. At least I will have two working phones if the power goes out."
4,It's Added Help In a Bottle,"I have been using the product for a month or so now in addition to my regular workouts and meal plans.Without it I lost about 2 pounds in one month, and while using it I lost 5 POUNDSSo basically it helped with the work I was already doingIt won't do all the work for you but it does help"
3,A continuation of the Aztec saga.,Published two years after Jennings death in 1999 Aztec blood is a continuation of the Aztec saga using Jennings outline and notes. Considering the amount of detail Jennings always inserted in his writings there must have beenan extensive body of information for the ghost writers to work from. It is a creditable job and a very good read from the opening letter to the king detailing the torture of Christo to Christo's transformation at the end.
3,Works O.K. but!,This product works O.K. for me but not as good as others for razor burn. Will not buy again.
2,won't last long,"This vacuum does have great suction power and is good at removing dirt and dog hair from my floor. However, after 1 1/2 years the wheels which you need in order to properly push the machine back and forth have broken off. They are attached with a plastic type part, which broke on one side. Even though the manual says there is a 2 yr warranty, there is no service centers within an hour and a half drive from my home(and I am not in a rural area) so even trying to get warranty service seems unlikely. I use it about twice a week. Now it is difficult to move over any rug and hopefully isn't scratching the floor. Needs to be replaced soon now....I am really disappointed since my last vacuum lasted 15 years , so this lack of quality is really disgusting. I wonder if all vacuums are made so cheaply now???"
5,Grover Goes to School,"I read this book to our son over 30 years ago before he started to kindergarten. It helped him with his five-year old fears. I was so excited to find a good used one since it is now out of print! It arrived in time, in very good condition, for our son to read to his little girl before she started to 4-year kindergarten. She loves it too and was smiling on her first day of school!"
5,OFF DA HOOK!,"All you phreaks gotta get this record! This disc is the bomb for 2000 beyond. Phat grooves, kick azz tracks. Off da hook!"
2,What the hell?,"Why is Carcass on here? If you've heard this album and hated the Carcass song on it, check out one of Carcass' newer albums, ""Heartwork"". It's TOTALLY different. You wouldn't even know its the same band, it has a different style, different people, different everything, and its a damn good CD, better than half the other bands on this CD. Even if you hated the Carcass tune on here, you still have to listen to ""Heartwork""."
5,Sarah's Love,"Sarah is a wonderful strong woman growing up in Arizona and Texas. She will fight to survive and keep her family safe. The book is Sarah's diary, started when she was a young girl with only a scant education. The writing is stilted and full of misspellings...but as the years pass, Sarah grows up and through her indomitable will and thirst for knowledge her diary gains fluency along with her reading skills.Sarah's life is full of the harsh realities of the west, Indians, Mountain Men, marriages and deaths. She is fearless in the face of adversity, earning her the respect of marauding Indians. She meets the love of her life early in the story, but doesn't recognize him as her one true love until much later. She fights to keep a deserted wagon full of books discovered on a wagon train because to her reading is the most important thing.The book is as powerful and strong as Sarah herself is. I'm looking forward to the sequal, Sarah's Quilt. Stay tuned!"
3,Fast and casual read,"I enjoyed this story about Sarah Prine and her struggles to survive in the Arizona Territory during the 1880s. The story is loaded with likable characters and the obstacles they face seem realistic, but there also is something about this story that seems predictable. The characters sometimes remind me of other characters in other books and I think that takes away from the book's strengths.Sarah is appealing and we want her to prevail and to be happy. It is nice to read a book that has a truly positive tone.The one gripe I have is the author's description of newborns and of nursing. Newborn babies do not smile! And babies don't nurse voraciously minutes after they are born. Mothers don't even get their milk for a couple days after their babies are born!"
4,Great western romance/historical ficiton,"This is a great book about a headstrong young woman settling in the Southwestern US in the 1880's. I almost put it down after the first 50 pages because it was filled with so much sadness, death, and depression. It is admittedly hard to get into the book at first, because it is all the writings of her diary. That is why I gave it 4.5 stars instead of 5. I am so glad I finished it though, because her romance with Captain Elliot is one of the sweetest I have read. This a wonderful book about overcoming obstacles, and the power of love."
5,I'll Remember this one for the rest of my life!,"What a book! I laughed out loud. I sobbed and had to get up and find a box of tissues. I savored every word. It made me want to start keeping a journal, although my life is surely dull compared to the life of Sarah Prine. Nancy Turner, well done!"
5,Wow! Breathtaking,"I can't add anything to what anyone here has said. READ THIS BOOK! It was a page-turner from beginning to end. I couldn't wait for her to come to her senses and see that Jack loved her. Seems everybody but her knew about it. I hated to see it end, but I kind of knew that it had to end that way. I hope they don't make a movie because the movie could never, ever do justice to the power of the book. I agree that Sam Elliot 15 years ago would make a perfect Jack (or maybe Tom Selleck), but he's too old for the part now. (Sigh! What a hearthrob!) Love it, love it, love it. Definitely worth owning."
5,Wanted it never to end,"I'm so glad I found this book. And, I've heard there is a SEQUEL COMING!!!!! I can't wait to read more about Sarah and her family. What a lovely, genuine story about good people facing the trials of pioneer life! THis is one to read again and again."
5,Great read,"Living in Arizona, what a wonderful book. With all the stress of today, this book takes you back to a time that is facinating..I loved the book, didn't want it to end. Curl up, open a bag of M&Ms and go back in time."
5,Historical fiction at its best,"This book was selected within the book club that I belong. To be honest, I wasn't that excited about it, as historical fiction isn't usually my favorite, but this book was truly a pleasant surprise. I was riveted to it from the moment I picked it up. I remember glancing down at the page number and realizing that so much had happened in just the first 26 pages alone---I knew I was in for a good ride. Not only was it a window into another time, a beautiful love story was interwoven throughout and showed how much of what defines us as women is timeless through the generations. A must-read for women. A great selection for book club discussions."
5,These is My Words,"This book is great! I couldn't put it down. I bought the second book Sarahs Quilt which I am reading now. They are both really great reading. K. Woodman Paw Paw, Wv."
4,Book arrived in great condition. Anxious to read.,This book was highly recommended to my book club. I amanxious to read it.
5,"So real, I felt like I was living this with Sarah.","I really enjoyed this book, cover to cover. Life was tough. Way tough. Sarah has the spirit and guts of a survivor - no matter what life throws her way she will meet it head on! I loved the story played out as a diary. You could see Sarah's writing get better as she self-educated herself by reading. Loved the book and just ordered the next two in the saga."
5,Read this book - NOW!!!,"I am so envious of people who haven't yet read this book, since they have the most amazing experience in front of them. This is the book that has EVERYTHING you could ever wish for - adventure, excitement, happiness, sorrows, and the most amazing love-story. You know how most love-stories always seem to fade once the couple gets each other - this love-story only gets better. And you will be so happy for the heroine Sarah, because she will become your new best friend. You will laugh with her, and cry with her and your heart will beat just as fast as hers when Jack is around. I've come to love Sarah so much that I find myself thinking quite often these days: What would Sarah think of this and that. This book reminded me of another great book by Miles Franklin, ""My brilliant career"". Read both of these books, and I personally guarantee you will have the time of your life!"
5,An excellent read,"This is an excellent read from beginning to the end. It is mostly the story of Sarah, a young woman who grew up in the early years of the United States. It is not only her story but one of many who endured hardships as well as successes, and gives us an insight as to what it took to make this the wonderful nation what it is."
3,1st one a dud - 2nd one pretty good,"First radio I ordered had to be sent back because display was dead.The second radio ordered seems to be working fine with good sound quality. The blue glow is very brite but it works great as a night light for our bathroom. Couldn't find another wall radio/clock so this one had to do. Overall, if the unit is long lasting, I will be happy with the purchase. $[...] was a fair price with free shipping through Amazon."
1,does not work,i ordered this item. it came on time but it doesnt work at all. i plug it in and the outside lites come on. i reset it like it says to and nothing happens. they sent me a broken clock thanks alot..
2,MORE TECHNO THAN INDUSTRIAL,"THIS COMPILATION IS OK. JUST OK ! THERE ISN'T MUCH TO HOLLER ABOUT! THE FEW TRACKS THAT ARE GOOD, I ALREADY HAD :(:( TRACK BY EVILS TOY IS THE BETTER SONG OVERALL! THE COMPILATION IS MORE FOR SOMEONE WHO LIKES HAPPY DANCY TECHNO. I LIKE MY TECHNO TO BE DARK, VERY DARK AND DANCY:):) BUY IT TO TRY OUT NEW STUFF!! DON'T BUY IT IF YOU ALREADY KNOW ALOT ABOUT EBM/INDUSTRIAL MUSIC!"
2,Not my cup of tea,"For this book to be useful, you've got to be an adult who has almost no self esteem at all, covers up this issue with being ""nice and perfect"", but simultaneously has a lot of will power. That's a rare combination of issues. And when I say will power, Maybe I should say obsessive-compulsive personality disorder; the author talks about struggling to stop trying to be perfect in chapter 1 and making 5-year plans in chapter 3.Good luck. I could only get 1/4 of the way through it.The book seems to be the author's meditation on overcoming his own personal problems; if it can help him, maybe it can help you. Instead of reading it, write your own!"
3,Self help lite,"A friend loaned me this book. It makes good general points but not is particularly good for those who need more extensive help, like with with codependency and personality issues. Most people are so engrained in their behaviors that the do it yourself approach is insufficient."
1,NICE GUYS GET FOOLED!!!!!!!,"THIS BOOK IS DEFINETELY NOT MY TASTE!!!I ORDERED IT TO MY LOCAL ENGLISH STORE, I WENT THROUGH THE WHOLE BOOK, AND I FELT DISAPPOINTED BY ITS CONTENTS SO I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS BOOK. FEW INFORMATION INSIDE AND NOT EXHAUSTIVE AT ALL !!!!THE TITLE 'SELLS' THE BOOK, BUT AS I READ IT , THIS BOOK WAS FIRST CALLED 'GOOD INTENTIONS', NOT ENOUGH BANKABLE TO THE EDITOR!!!!!!THERE ARE SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE SUBJECT, HIS PERSONAL EXAMPLES ARE BORING AND LONG TO READ THAT YOU END UP LOSING THE POINT ABOUT THE CHAPTER.I READ A BOOK ABOUT THE SUBJECT, BUT IT'S ABOUT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND, IT'S CALLED 'NICE GUYS DONT GET LAID', IT HAS FUNNY ILLUSTRATIONS AND EASY TO READ.THIS BOOK WAS RE-EDITED SEVERAL TIMES AND IS MY BIBLE !!!"
3,Deceptive advertising,"I ordered these small BooBoo Packs for kids, thinking I would be getting a box of them as shown in the product picture, rather than just one, which is what I received. No,I did not read every word to find the quantity of the product, but the picture of the product showed one BooBoo pack displayed with a box of several. Also, had it been obvious that I was buying only one of these very small, very thin items, I would not have paid $13.00 for it! Looking back at the product description, I still cannot find where it clearly states you only get one single ice pack. The product description should have said somewhere that the item was one each rather than one box as shown. In this case, a few words would have been worth 1000 pictures. I was ripped off with deceptive advertising!"
4,Insinkerator Filter,Filter for Insinkerator. Doesn't leak and the water flows. It functions as designed. Price was competitive and happy with the process -- order processed in a timely way and received exactly what was ordered!
3,Bring back the old flow,I am a long time Mystikal fan and this cd is only average. I was looking for his old style of flow but this is more dance music than vintage Mystikal. Still a aight cd though. If you are an fan of mystikal like I am then you should purchase this.
5,A Must Have!!!,If you don't have this CD you better go get it!!! There's noway possible that anyone can hate or not like this CD. This isthe best Mystikal (mysti-cal [cal like caliber because that'show he hits you..like a high caliber machine gun]). This is hisbest work ever..a solid CD from start to finish. Damn good jobMYSTIKAL!!!!!!!
2,"Tarantula-No, Daddy Long Legs-Yes","Although Mystikal has a different style since his departure from No Limit, his music has gone to more pop. Is he trying to sell records or sell out? His more dance style has made him lose his thug-like background. This latest Lp has shown that he has lost his ability to keep it gangsta, and may take his carrer 6ft. underground. The cd isn't bad, with songs like Settle The Score, but his first single was a blow to his apperance, classify Mystikal as Pop, not hip hop."
3,choppy & oddly edited,"I selected this movie because I am from the area of Texas where it was filmed, and also I happen to like Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The movie starts out rather slowly and stays that way through almost half. The way it was edited left the audience a bit confused as to where we were and what was happening in the scene. I gave it 3 stars mostly because of JDM, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone who isn't a fan of his or Sam Worthington."
1,Wast of time,"Worst movie I've seen yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! The detectives are so stupid that I hardly paid attention to any of them. The female cope deserves to be hanged, her ex-husband should have been the one to die, and the good cope, well he's just too good for words because he gets killed. I was hoping that the writing would have been better. I man, this guy started killing in the 70s and well into the mid 90s. However, the movie does not tell you that. And, what's up with the blond girl and the her whacked out family. Weird brother and ever weider guy that wore the dark glasses. Not to mention the black guy and the blond guy. Where they the serial killer or killers. This movie did not leave any answers but generated many questions. I would not waste my money on buying the DVD."
3,Texas Killing Fields,This movie is ok.I am not sorry that I bought it.I am sure others that come to my house will want to watch it.
4,Excellent football game,"I believe this was the first sporting game released on thee PSP and what a great game it is! The load time, the gameplay, options, graphics and sound are fantastic! Though this game isn't that user friendly(I was stuck on how to start a game after selecting my team!), it really is an excellent sporting one to have in your PSP library!"
5,Delicious!,"My husband loves this stuff. It's not as hot as it claims to be, but still has plenty of kick and a very tasty flavor."
2,Just because it is different.......,"I feel this album is a great example of how artists outside of the technological music genres can listen to them and think, ""all those bleeps and bloops are so simple and boring in their composition, I with my musical intelligence can do so much more!"" Well sadly enough there is alot going on here but nothing that adds to either the techno or jazz genre. Alot of complicated afterthoughts that make the jazz sound out of place, and the techno weak and under-researched. Maybe Bugge should listen to some, ""Man Called Adam"" or ""Isotope 217"", and get back to us."
2,Lots and lots of errors,"Many errors were not on the publisher's site. If you are going to write a book, please make sure the code works. Try using it! Am I being unreasonable?"
5,The best introductory book for VB,"This is the perfect book for self-study and for anyone interested in learning vb with little or no programming experience. The author introduces us to the fundamental concepts of vb and hand guide us to implementing useful vb applications without overwhelming readers with too much information at one time. each concept, each section is written with extreme clarity and gently eases readers to the world of vb. by the end of the book, readers are ready to creating powerful vb applications with a solid understanding of the vb language.Beginning Visual Basic 5 is without a doubt, *the* best introductory book to learning vb. you might want to get Core Visual Basic 5 as your second book for more advanced coverage. good luck!"
4,A great book.,"This is a great book for beginners. I found Peter Wright's easy going style of writing to be refreshing. This book covers a bit more ground than most ""beginner books"" therefore you will gain a solid understanding of the language."
3,"Not bad, but last 4 chapters are frustrating.","As a beginner to Visual Basic, I found the book easy to follow as I was sitting behind my computer working through the exercises -- until I got to chapter 15. I found myself a little frustrated in Chapters 15 to 18 (especially 18) with the long-winded examples that required so much typing I wondered if I was really comprehending the text or just being a stenographer. Overall a good book to start VB training, but the presentation / complexity in the last 4 chapters was, in my opinion, disappointing."
3,"Ok for beginners, but...","If you're new to the VB language, this book isn't all THAT bad. If you're in search of a certification, however, stay away. The author provides decent examples, but the problem is that he has you typing in a long example (you COULD d/l the code from WROX website) without explaining what the code means until after you've done that. This left me very confused as I was typing in some of the examples. Also, the book covers a limited range of topics, so I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO PREPARE FOR THE EXAM! PERHAPS a 4-star if not for that, the author's obvious contempt for the C language, and vain attempt at humor."
3,Great Motivator!,"Havey's content of her book is very motivational and gives its readers hope. It is very down to earth and easy to read. However, I have never read a book with as many typographical and grammatical errors as this! This was annoying as it was almost every other page."
1,bum deal,The motor burnt out and the regulator needed to be replaced again 6 months after installation. Poor quality.
5,Great aid in starting to learn Spanish!,"I used this book before and during Arlene's 84-hour Beginners Spanish class, and it is excellent! The exercises in the book are playful, fun, creative, and helped me remember many important grammar and verb particularities. This is a great approach to, and aid in helping people who are just starting to learn Spanish (or refresh their Beginners skills)."
2,I'm over pronto,I'm kinda over pronto remotes all together. After spending over $1000 on pronto remotes IE the 3000 which has stopped responding and the 7000 which rarely works with RF I've given up and gone the cheaper and more reliable route of logitech. Thanks for nothing pronto.
5,maximum skaterock capacity,"Buy this album or ali boulala will beat the hell out of you and get deported again, and geoff rowley will punch you in the stomach twice. man enough to call my bluff? didnt think so..skate or be murdered in cold blood"
5,mid 80's dischord greatness,"gray matter is like so totally rad dudes! kidding, seriously though, this is a great dischord release. probably dischord's best release after the label kinda switched from straight-up hardcore/punk to more art/hardcore/college radio friendly/punk. if you like this get Rites of Spring, One Last Wish, Three and support Steve Niles by buying his comics!!!"
4,farts,"I bought this album because I saw that ler and brain from primus were on it. That was good enough for me. I expected something in the vain of primus. That isn't what I got. This album is best described as techno fused with hip-hop turntable stuff. It's pretty cool. I'm pretty sure brain plays an electronic drumset throughout most of the album. I have no idea what larry plays on this. If you're a fan of DJ disk, buy this. It's got an interesting feel to it. If you're open minded and appreciate electronic music, then this is for you. If you're looking for a primus side project, go buy the sausage album."
4,Interesting book to read,I have loved hearing everything I could all my life about Helen Keller. This was quite interesting especially when she told about when she was little and ill and when she first could not see or hear. I wish the book was put together a little better as it jumps from place to place and it is sometimes hard to follow. Helen was a very smart little girl and she made so much of what skills and senses that she did have. What an example she is for all of us to follow in our difficulties and challenges. This is an interesting book to read.
4,HKS Reloader,This is a HKS Model 943. I wish this information had been posted with the item. It will not work with a Beretta 92FS but it will work with my 380ACP Escort. I bought it for my Beretta 9mm but opened the package before checking it out. My mistake. Be careful that the HKS re-loader you buy will work with your gun. There is a list on the back.
5,Finger Saver,"This loader sure saves your fingers, with not having to hold down on the bullets while loading magazine. This will work on single stack magazines only. I have a HI Point 380, 9mm , 40 S&W , 45 ACP that are all single stack mags. This will work on the 380 and 9mm but not on the 40 or 45 , because the magazines are to long to fit in the speedloader for them. This was shipped very fast."
1,step up and buy a quality loader,"I have two other magazine loaders both are Lula speed loaders. They cost twice as much as this loader but the good thing is THEY WORK!!! This HKS loader is made with cheap plastic and feels like it will break just getting it out of the packaging. My 9mm, 380, 40SW and .45 would not fit even though this is advertised as a large cal. loader. It said it would work with these cal. mag's but if you try to put a magazine in the device, it fails to adjust to the size. I doubt you could load .22 ammo with this cheap loader. Save your money and purchase a Butler Creek Lula loader."
4,Quality Storage Rack,This is a well-made storage rack and goes together without any problems. Two of the wood-grain panels had some slight cosmetic damage and they were promptly replaced at no charge. Definitely recommended.
1,I JUST DONT GET IT.,"I have heard and read alot about this group. One review compared them to Patti Smith and Blondie. This is not only incorrect, it's insulting to both artists.It seems this music is only getting noticed because its members claim to wave the rainbow flag (if you know what I mean). Lets hope the novelty wears off before this goes too far. What are record companies thinking these days?"
4,A fine translation but...,"Though the translation has many notes and as far as I can see, is accurate, there is at least one thing that bothers me. In one passage on lifting an autumn ""hair,"" this translation has ""hare."" Hair seems to be the correct word because all the other translations have hair. If this mistake was overlooked, you just have to wonder what else? What's strange however is that an earlier translation The Seven Military Classics from the same author has that one passage with the word ""hair."" Go figure."
4,Yet another book you should read asap!,While I do not have this perticular copy of the art of war I have read it and can say its one of the best books ever written on the proper use of military force! Sun Tzu was a genius and his discoveries on the subject of war should not be ignored. if at all possible aquire a copy and read it now!
5,The real book,"This is the real Art of War book translated. Haven't had a chance to read it yet, as is just came in today. But I got the promised book, and Amazon got it shipped right on time."
3,Just ok.,Not Fowlers best caliper. Made cheap. Save up some money and buy Better made. I gave these away when it came in.
4,"Good, but a little annoying","My son loves these series! The theme tune is catchy and he loves to sing it, and the video footage is well shot and keeps him interested. The only drawback is the voice over they do with the equipment, it is a bit cheesy and annoying to listen too, especially when your son watches it over and over and over....of course, apparently he doesn't seem to mind."
4,Construction dvd for kids,"This is a great gift for boys two years old and older! It has the perfect compliment of video, narration, and music. Our grandson loves it!!!"
1,It sucks!,"I'll give you very valueable advice................DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Very boring,long loadtimes,bad grapics,and horrible gameplay"
2,Wow..can we say primitive?,"My daughter has many game systems and loads upon loads of games. I put this in her stocking for Christmas and she spent an hour at it and then gave it to a neighbor. It was the most boring, primitive in graphics and action game I've seen in a long time. Pretty poor. [...]. Bleh. I recommend SKATE for a great action-packed game for younger teenagers with no violence or anything bad to influence your child. Lots of fun. I'd skip this one ..no RUN right by it..."
2,Not feelin' it,"Got some hot DJs but not on par with DanceHall Kings I and III. I'd actually think this is a different series? 1/2 the tracks are on the Bellyas riddim, the other 1/2 are on some other riddim, forgot the name, but it's not popular.But, if you're into the Bellyas riddim (half the CD) like I'm NOT, you'd love this CD."
4,kateland,"This is all new to me. I have never been or seen inside a diner. Where i come from there are only restaurants. So this is something rather different. I felt very cosy when this documentary took me in there. I felt a good friendly atmosphere inside the diners. And noticed they really heaped the plates up with food. It all began to make me feel a little hungry, even wishing i was a customer too. I noticed all the delicious homemade desserts as well, they looked a mouthwatering treat. GLORIOUS FOOD. Visiting an American Diner was a pleasurable experience for me."
3,Good but a lot of them are duplicates,Good but a lot of them are duplicates... You can find some more cheaper and complete set at home depot
1,Unusable Internet Play,"The single-player mode looked like a good, if not especially interesting, RTS environment to play in, but it was painful to play over the Internet; not because of any technical difficulty with firewalls, NAT routers, etc, but because the game slowed to a dead crawl in networked mode. Unless you only want to play it by yourself, I can't recommend this game. Since I wanted to play it with the same people I played Red Alert 2, Age of Empires/Mythology, and Generals with, it was a disappoinment."
5,Great Music!,"I've had this album since it first came out and still listen to it at least once a week. It is fun, energetic, fresh and classic all at once. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in good music. It's danceable, if that's your thing, but not cheesy, and has some sweet ballads too. Very solid performances by all the musicians. Check out their new album too! These guys rock!"
4,FANTASTIC CD!!!,"A WONDERFUL CD FROM 1991! THIS CD HAS TWO OF HIS BIGGEST HITS:1 - WALK ON FAITH2 - I'LL STOP LOVING YOU!I GIVE IT A 4 OUT OF 5 BECAUSE NOTHING IS PERFECT!A GREAT COUNTRY ARTIST WHO HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM SINCE THE EARLY 1990'S.BEFORE THIS CD, HE HAD A NUMBER ONE HIT W/ RONNIE MILSAP CALLED ""OLD FOLKS"".A GREAT VOICE & AN EXELLENT SONGWRITER TO BOOT!""TWILIGHT TOWN"" IS ANOTHER CD YOU MIGHT FIND ENTERTAINING AS WELL.SEARCH THESE CD'S OUT ON AMAZON.COM & LISTEN TO THE 30 SECOND SOUNDBITES!THEY WILL SHOWCASE THE MAN'S MANY TALENTS!"
3,Comprehensive,"The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't have the ""Bobby Rydel"" version on it and I later found out that he was the vocalist who sang the version I wanted with the ""whoa whoa"" it it."
1,Five Aces,"Couldn't figure it out, where it was going, is how terrible it was. Fell asleep watching it several times before giving up."
5,It Works,"It preforms as desired, and it shipped quickly. Not much more than one would be able to say about it."
4,Americana at lunch time,This is a great show if you like finding the hidden and unpretentious places real people go. I should be accompanied with a recipe book.
3,Too much hype?,"I couldn't wait to get this for my son (11 mos.) based on all the cute commmercials, but he just hasn't been that interested in it. Maybe with age/time the interest will come. It's definitely cute, however and does cute stuff that probably other toys don't do, probably just for the simplicity of it. The legs and heads ""click"" like a wrench when you twist them and the ""mama"" monkey makes monkey noises. He is probably most interested in the toucan which makes a funny noise. All-in-all, though it just doesn't hold his attention. He has the polar bear set too and he feels about the same towards it."
4,Fun for little ones...,"We bought this set and the polar bear set for our son when he was about 6mos old. It's great for little ones about that age. Once he got older and was mobile he lost all interest in these. We came across them as we were going through his toys recently (he's 2 now) and even with an imagination now, no sparks. So they'll be going to friends of our who have a 4month old for a few months of use."
3,Not working for me,"I'm 20% through the book, and I just don't see the usefulness of it. I've read many good things about this book but some bad reviews as well.Anyway, I'll keep slogging through it. Read a sample chapter before you buy this one."
2,Fabulous music-wretched engineering,"Unfortunately, Sony engineers Tim Geelan and Larry Keyes take the old school approach to 78s, and amputate the treble along with the noise in these reissues. Once you've heard what really is stored on old 78s -- e.g. in Steven Lasker's superb digital restorations onThe Best Of The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition-- sound on ""The Okeh Ellingon"" is intolerable. One can only hope that these fabulous Ellington tracks get reissued again with different engineers. To hear just how good 78 sound can be, check outBessie Smith 1925-1933Hermes label, andThe Very Best of Ella Mae Morse."
3,"Great Music, Poor Remastering","What else can I say? I played a very clean copy of the 78 rpm of ""Diga Diga Doo"" on my turntable last week, then put on this CD's remastering, and it was amazing how Sony's engineeers drained all the presence and warmth out of what were some of the BEST recorded 78s of their era! Don't get me started on the pitch problems with the acoustic recordings! Now that Sony-BMG have merged, one can only pray that 21st-century technology will be applied to these masterworks and put this mangy puppy to sleep. 3 stars for music alone."
3,judging books....,"I'm going with three stars because I haven't read *this* ""Cassandra"" yet; I just want to point out that all the complaints about stylistic points and language are extremely dismaying, you are all judging a wonderful author based on a (quite likely) mediocre--if the reviews are any clue--translation, which isn't fair. The book everyone here is reviewing sounds like it has very little in common with Christa Wolf's ""Kassandra"" in the original. This happens with a lot of ""foreign"" authors: ie. Rudiger Safranski's Nietzsche bio is fabulous, while his Schoepenhauer one draaaaags on and on, and is taking me absolutely forever to plow through. The difference is the translator."
2,Cassandra is quite complicated to read,"Once I read Cassandra, I didn't understand any of her stories. It is complicated to read and not possible to find a summary in the internet. That's what made me read the book for another two times. There's no real action in the story. So it is quite boring to read it. No matter - that's how women are."
3,"When did they replace the ""poker"" with a Nub stick","The kit comes fully assembled, which is nice. However the Standard Poker now is a useless L shaped nub, and the brush is not buch bigger than a paintbrush. The log grabber is the only thing decent on this whole set. At least it was inexpensive..."
1,Very poor design,The log pinchers don't stay hanging on the hooks - they slide open and fall off so I have to keep it leaning against the wall. Not a defect just a simple design flaw!
5,Solid metal,"The tools are constructed of heavy solid metal, as is the stand. We use the tools and they're not purchased for cosmetic decoration. This set of fireplace tools will last for years to come."
5,Motels - Anthologyland,"What can I say, I love Martha Davis' voice, the lead singer for the Motels!! I had to replace the album from audio cassette to compact disc!! The CD's last longer that the audio tapes do!! I have every album that the Motels put out!!"
5,Persistent and Phenomenal,"I love the fact that Howard Schultz was rejected from a job for a year! It's refreshing that it's not all a bed of roses for the uber-successful.I found this DVD very inspiring and watch it over and over, especially the part where he urges you never to give up on your dreams.Also, I found the bonus of this DVD to be the part all about how to build a great team."
3,This is terrible!,"Once you learn how to play the game, it is way too easy. The online gaming is a joke because all you have to do is instantly pass the ball up the court and you will always be open for a wide open 3. An example of this is one game I just played online, he had one guy who had 66 points and I had one with 59. All of these point were off of wide open 3 pointers. There is no way to get back on defense and stop this from hapening so this kind of ruins the game."
4,CLASSIC,Loved it. it has some romance and fun mixed in with the karate and kung-fu and this move made it work perfectly. a great buy.
2,Can't use it indoors,"The thing looks great and it's a great size. I can't use it though, since it smells like a burning tire factory. I've run it through the dishwasher twice and soaked in in soap for 48 hours. Smells exactly the same. I threw it on my patio table to see if it will stop smelling by summer. Until then, it's pretty much useless. My buddy got the one from Williams Sonoma (no longer offered in this size) and it has no scent at all."
4,Shame it's out of print!,"I read this book about 15 years ago. The artist Taly Johnson's father wrote it.The Game is about some people who live in facing high-rise apartments. Casual voyeurism becomes a structured game, with different points given for things witnessed in people's windows.Quite a competition erupts between the two buildings.It's one of those stories that's stayed with me over the years and, tonight, I decided to try to find the book.Nice to see it's available used, anyway!"
4,Functional & a good value,"This watch is a good value for the money. Nothing exciting, but at least the numbers are big enough to see for us middle aged people. I always buy Timex watches, they don't last as long as the used to, I used to have ones that lasted well over 15 years and my watches have to take a lot of abuse. I find that the Indiglo feature is the first thing to go, but I have actually sent watches back for that to be fixed and they did fix it for the $7 fee. I would definitely recommend this as a good everyday watch. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of my previous experience with the failure of the Indiglo feature and the fact that they don't last forever, but hey, if they did, the company would go out of business!"
2,Timex watch,"The watch came on time as promised. It works fine, keeps accurate time.The only thing I don't like is it is an easy read, but the date needs a magnifier glass. There is plenty of space on the face to make the numbers bigger. So, if you need the date at a glance, this watch isn't much help.UpdateThis watch just slowly quit working. First the date stopped working, then the second hand stopped working and finally the hour-minutes hands stopped. I didn't have it very long just over a year. For a Timex, it just didn't keep on ticken. I dropped it from 5 to 2 stars."
1,Awful,"The man knows nothing about science in general or evolution in particular. He revels in his own ignorance with his smugness that almost makes one's skin crawl, all while spewing one uniformed remark after another. How anybody can take this clown seriously is beyond me."
3,A diamond in the rough,"I used to have a rather lukewarm opinion of this album, but I'm listening to it at the time of this writing and I've changed my mind about it. It's actually an entertaining listen and band. Most of this record sounds like the band is just jamming with the barest skeletons of songs to hold it together, but it has the distinctive sound that marks Midnight Oil and bears the seeds of what would become truly great music, pretty much everything that came after."
3,Interesting,"This book is interesting if you can make it pass chapter 2. The book as a slow start, as the writer takes a few chapters (1-4) to get to the point. However, after that the questions are very interesting for you and your partner."
3,Pretty good,"I bought this for my boyfriend because of the cheap price and all the good reviews. I think it's good for the price, but not as nice as I was expecting. It was a little bit big, and I didn't like how it looked that much. He liked it though, so I guess that's what's important."
5,GET THIS.,"If you are looking for an awesome wallet for a guy in your family, this is the one to get. It has all kinds of compartments and slots for cards. I was so amazed when I opened it. It closes nicely without being bulky, too. I love it. I definitely recommend it."
2,not good,"I really think people/artist need to stop signing with Puff/Diddy or what ever hell he want to call him self. His first album wasn't the best, but at least I would listen to that more than once or leave it in the cd player. How many careers is Puff going to mess up; he's damn sho doing it to 8Ball & MJG. Is Yung Joc going to be another one. The Best song to me is Momma. I see why Jeezy left and did his own thing."
1,No Extras,"Really Sony? Why keep releasing blu-rays with no extras? Do we look stupid to you? We buy films mostly because of the special features, not for the film itself. Just to watch the movie, I'd rather see it on cable, Netflix or download."
2,It is sad but Spider-Man 3 is the worst out of the 3.,"It is sad to see a great movie went downhill. After enjoying the first 2 Spider-Man, people have great expectation of the latest story, especially Spider-Man's arch-villain Venom is in it.The problem with Spiderman 3 is the director trying to jam too much into the movie. Too many characters, too little time, and it ends up that non of the characters has enough development into them. Viewers can't not relate to their pain or why they they fight. The end fight is pretty much meaningless after learning the story of Sandman at the end; people would wonder why Sandman even bother to setup the end fight with Spidy at first."
3,SPIDERMAN 3 protect and serve--2.5 stars,"spiderman 3 is serviceable entertainment. we all know the story(ies) involved and for the most part they tie up loose ends. acting, plot and special effects are all well done. so, why the lower star review?---it all seemed pretty convenient(yes, I know all stories finalize-but it still felt that way). Is this a bad movie?, absolutely not!, the best thing in the movie were not the main stars but the minor characters(great lines! funny). what makes the series holdup is humor, romance and humanity. I just think they tried too hard. will there be a 4th? if you pay attention to whats on the internet-4 is a go no matter what. lets hope all involved will be retained."
2,Breaking the backbone of the comic,"As a child I was raised with Spiderman comics and when one of my favorite director took the reigns and gave us two incredible movies I was estatic. The second spiderman was the heart of the comic, the doing right no matter what you had to give up. I can't tell you how many times I watched Spiderman 2 and still love it.But I wish I could forget Spiderman 3. What made Spiderman NOT Batman was his motivation wasn't revenge it was about not doing the right thing and it had a consequence. In this movie Peter letter the robber go would not have saved his Uncle. That he had to GET the sandman was like a thousand other movies.The villians had nothing on Docter Octopus, none of the tragedy the irony, the coolness that was in the second movie. If I had never loved Spiderman, never remember why he was special I probably love this movie but I wish we could have a do over.Sorry Sam but what where you thinking?!"
3,A bit dissapointing,"Any follow up to Spiderman 2 was going to be a little bit of a letdown, but this one tried to cram to much in at once. After all the build up to Harry vs. Peter, I think they did that story a disservice by not having it be the focus of the film. I also think they did a disservice to the Venom character by cramming him into an already loaded film."
1,CGI Overkill,"I turned this off 10 minutes into the movie because the CGI overkill was making me sick. If they have a movie with a budget this big, and the fan base to support it, then write a decent script rather then trying to out-do Star Wars by using CGI for 99% of the movie and trying to add 1% plot around it.The movie might well have gotten better after the first half hour, but I will never know because I can not stand the useless and terrible looking CGI with actors who don't cast any shadow or light from their surroundings.Sometimes I can see past the bad CGI, but this one is just overkill, and was it really needed to tell anything in the story? The whole alley way surfboard scene just turned me off completely.I'm glad i didnt waste my money on this one."
2,My Movie Reivew is Not Tingling at All,"Well well well. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is because I love Spiderman and the fight scenes were passable. I don't want to give away any of the movie here so I can not write why I really hate this movie. In the end I will say this, when Peter has Venom his hair becomes Emo. UMMMM , WHAT!?!?!? Venom = emo hair. I am lost with that math. Well I really love Spiderman so I hope they go back to the basics and make a good 4th movie that you know follows the comics better."
4,Great movies,"hello-mine is more of a question-based on the 'product information' on SM 3 (only)-the technical information says= aspect ratio is 2:40:1 which is LETTEBOX (black bars on top/bottom) of a WS TV.BUT when I click on the SM TRILOGY and check the 'product information' it says-number of discs=3, aspect ratio 1:85:1 which is WS but NOT LETTERBOX-so no bars on the top/bottomcan someone who owns the trilogy please answer this before i decide what to purchase if the trilogy is 1:85:1 or is not. thank you"
2,The first 110 minutes are horrible,"I am a huge fan of the first two movies. But the first 110 minutes of this movie were a mix of depressing and flat out boring. Right at 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie starts to get really good--and the last 20 minutes are wonderful with the same characteristics of the first two movies: action, drama, tension are all present and well represented. Unfortunately, there's none of that in the sophomoric build-up of the characters in the first 84% of the movie.If it hadn't been Spider-man, I would have turned the movie off long before 110 minutes into it.So if you want to see this movie, rent it and stick it out (or fast-forward) to the last 20 minutes.My S.O. and I have 2 copies of the first 2 movies on DVD. But neither of us feel like buying even one copy of the third movie."
3,not bad,"some awful reviews but its really not that bad....in fact the first hour is pretty darn good......then it gets bogged down in ""Pirates 2"" syndrome...but ""Pirates 2"" sucked much worse than this one...sure theres too many damn characters and the whole Harry thing and Peter still griping about uncle Ben.....the film woulda been much better if they woulda just expanded the Sandman role cuz lets face it, Thomas Haden Church is a great actor and fits this role perfectly.....Topher Grace sucked as Venom/Eddie Brock..what a waste...Venom shoulda just had his own movie outside of Spiderman with someone else playin him.......one shining moment- any scene Bryce Dallas Howard is in.....if they make a 4th film and she is in it....im there pal...she is drop dead gorgeous...i now know what love is"
3,Good,"The Spider-Man films are the zenith of comic book filmdom, and, save for a bit of middle filmitis, and too many villains (but the screenwriters almost reconcile this flaw anyway), this film comes damned close to being the best of the three. Its comic book sensibility (not striving to be `too' real), its writing, acting, and even special effects, add up to an enjoyable experience. Is it Antonioni, Bergman, Kurosawa? No. But, as a comic book film, it doesn't have to be (and, likely, it simply constitutionally could not be, for it is based on an art form for juveniles). Still, it's significantly better than its critics claimed, and this is likely because there is a tendency to subconsciously anticipate failure in such a successful series. The difference between bad critics and great ones is that they don't just anticipate failure, they long for it. I put my expectations aside, let the film play out, and was rewarded. What a concept!"
3,Semi-Bad...,"Okay, let me start off saying there a waaaaaay too many villains in the film (by the way I'm reviewing the film not the DVD). Sandman, Goblin, AND Venom?! You gotta be kidding me! I think Venom is amazing (in the comics). But sadly, he barely had any screen time in the movie. Sandman was OKAY... Nothing special. The Goblin was pretty cool, and that's probably the best part of the movie. Another thing. There is too much drama. Come on!! This is a superhero movie not some romance movie. 3/4 of this movie is boring romance stuff between Mary Jane and Peter. That's about it with the bad stuff. The good things are the acting was good and the special effects were great. Overall about 3/5 to me."
5,Good Action and Drama!,"A lot of people I've talked to says this movie was boring and long, and that is so not true! It was a great movie! I was blown away watching how the relationships between the characters changed. Speaking of which Spiderman goes through serious changes in this movie! The ending moreover, was a blow out! It was awesome! It keep me cringing that everything would turn out ok!"
4,"My fav of the Spidermans, my son loves it also",Great movie. Its my personal favorite and was my sons until the new version with Andrew Garfield. I'd definitely recommend it.
3,Serves its purpose,"My 4 year old wanted this movie - he loves Spiderman. He has watched it several times already, and enjoys the movie. I wasn't impressed with it...I thought it was kind of cheesey, had too many villains and too much story line crammed into one movie. Glad I didn't waste my money at the theater for this one."
2,Huge disappointment,Where's the relationship gone? Everything here was plastic and overwrought. Topher was wasted. A great young actor lost in a costume. The next time write better.
2,Misfire 3,"The classic sequel formula poured out again: More villains, bigger sets, more special effects, more falling objects, longer time to watch - and of course, it's all superfluous. We've seen Mary Jane saved from a falling death in the last two films. Why does this have to be like this again? It gets really stale after awhile. The parts where Peter turns mean after putting on the Venom suit are unintentionally hilarious. Suddenly Peter's hair is black and Goth, and he scowls a lot, acting more like a real New Yorker would. He then has an urge to dance at a local bar. SP3 gets way off track here. Just more evidence of a fat, overdone flop that leaves us (like Star Wars 3, Matrix 3, et al.) sad and wondering why directors have to screw their own public over and tarnish their original work.And that's why they're doing Spider Man 4."
1,Another Toby Macquire Sob Fest,Please believe me when I tell you that I am completely against the detention center in Guantanamo Bay...well for the most part. Whoever made the decision to cast the snivelling one-dimesional spent-Kleenex(R) Toby Maquire in the part of spiderman should be locked up. Really one should only have to glance at the title...Spider Man 3 to know what is in store. I honestly think Tom Hulce who played the part of Wolfgand (read Volfy) in the groundbreaking film Amadeus or even Richard Dreyfuss (thespiatus of Goodbye Girl repute) would have made a better spidey. I guess I should have said right up fron that I only lasted 7 minutes into the film. Instead of popcorn substitute soma for this one. More evidence that the Hollywood sausage factory is alive and well.
5,Friendly Neighborhood Spidey To The Rescue!!!!,"I wathced Spiderman3 that my mom rented it from Netflix for me to see it.I really like the 3rd Sequel I thought it was better than the other 2.This 3rd Sequel has more villians,jealousy & revenge.Peter's old friend Harry Osbourne becomes the New Goblin to go after Peter Parker as Spiderman that he still blames him for the death of his father.And starts wearing this strange mysterios blacksuit makes become a whole different person & causes him to neglect the ones he love including Mary Jane his Love Interest.There were to 2 other villians in the movie is The Sandman Flint Marko who killed Peter's uncle & The Venom is Edward Brock they were after Spiderman to kill.Harry found out the truth that Spiderman didn't kill his father.At the end of the movie I cried when Harry Osbourne died.I would love yo get the 3rd Sequel to add it with my other 2 Spiderman Collections!!!!"
5,Spiderman 3,spiderman 3 is the best of the trilogy it has the most action the story is okay get it the critics dont know what they're talking about
4,Venom rules!,"This is a Blu-Ray, right? The disc has tons of space, right? So, why didn't they cram in more extras? Loved the movie and loved the commentary tracks while seeing it in all the HDMI Hi-def glory. It is hard to say ""no"" to. Considering the limited quantity of decent titles on Blu-Ray, currently, this is a good place to start with a Blu-Ray collection. If you're a Spidey fan and you didn't agree with this flick then just wait for Spidey 1 and 2 to get on Blu-Ray, if it hasn't already."
1,Made for the Money; No Comprehendible Story Here,"This movie answers the question, what do we do with SM after we run out of ideas for a story line. Here we have a super hero who in prior movies was strong enough to stop a speeding train and now is flummoxed by some dude on a flying skateboard. Come on! This movie is totally inconsistent with prior movies when it comes to SM's super powers. He has somehow come down several notches in power for this movie.The other villains are equally dumb and uninteresting. I found myself cheering for the ""dark"" Spider Man because at least that character had some character. As to basic plot and story, there isn't any. Just a series of scenes fighting different villains and a hopelessly convoluted sub-plot regarding the girl friend.Only a Spider Man fanatic would consider giving this movie more than two stars and/or consider watching it more than one time. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Spiderman 3,I wanted to complete the series. From my POV not as good as 2nd but graphics are quite impressive. I don't think the viewing experience would have been better on the blueray format and price differential.
3,"not as bad as people told me it was, good in fact","I have come to the conclusion that if you are a superhero with a 'secret' identity, you ought to leave your mask on. Of course, green goblin, and venom, and mary jane, and harry, and god knows who all else know it's peter, so why bother with the suit at all, but seriously Toby is a big star and his agent won't let him wear a mask for more than 30 seconds in the whole film, fine, but it makes the movie seem dumber than it normally would. Not Fantastic Four dumb, but dumb nonetheless.Highs :Well, none really, but pretty even throughout.Lows :Venom looked wimpy.Continuity, how did Brock imitate spiderman before he had superpowers, or did I doze off?"
2,Too Much Action Not Enough Plot,This Spiderman was a rushed job. It had a lot of action but not enough plot. Topher Grace was great as Venom. But by the time he make an appearance it was close to the end of the movie. In this case too many crooks spoil the pot.
4,Great film!,"I really don't understand the negative reviews listed... Am a fan of the first 2 movies and I watched this movie for the first time over the past weekend and found it to be wonderful... great fun, great effects, great story. I think you have to take it for what it is and just sit back and enjoy it, not read so much into every detail, as it really is great film all round. I think the actors did a great job, and there was a lot of meaning to the story.. I mostly felt for Harry, and think James Franco did excellent in portraying him.. in all the films. Anyhow, I really liked this one :)"
5,GREAT!!!!!,This movie is retardedly great!Like it's not a exactly a good movie but it's fun.I must admit Venom is SWEET!!!I am a kid but I am over 13!I'm 13 and a few weeks.Well anyhow this movie is fun.I duno if you should buy it though.Maybe rent it.Maybe buy it.Look get it if you want!HEE HEE!
4,Great Wireless Mouse,"This is a great wireless mouse. Fits great in my hand, works great, completely plug and play."
5,My favorite Mouse,"Second one I've purchased, someone stole my first one (at school - I'm a teacher) and I just had to get another one - I love it!"
1,Pure Junk,Do Not Buy This Item.The filters don't do anything.The wide & zoom len's are out of focus on the edges.
1,47th St.=SHADY dealer and low quality lens,"As those of you who research these things know...47th ST. has the shady reputation of ""confirmation calls"", ""heavy upselling"", low priced advertised products being ""out of stock"", etc. Check ALL these Camera/Electronic ""resellers"" in [...] to get info. The product itself is flimsy with low quality lenses which seriously degrade the image quality of your camera. Better to spend a bit more and go for quality."
3,KIT,"The bag is OK, the tripod is one of the worst I've seen, but it does it's functions. The lenses are very bad. They don't work, as they should be, they even distort the picture, the filters are pretty good, but I don't use them often, the cleaning kit is good.Overall I don't think this is a good kit, but it's something to get started, to play around if you are an amateur and you don't want to spend much money."
3,I work for a man who follows this book...,"I've worked as an employee, shift leader, and now a manager under many different general managers. After I had been a manager for 3 months, my most recent (and still current) GM loaned me this book. It's a quick read, and offers many interesting facts about Lincoln's interactions with many of his generals and other commanding officer. I can see all of the qualities and attitudes I read about in my GM, and our theater is the best in town. If you don't mind ""lowering yourself"" to walk among your subordinates, then this book is for you. It also provides examples of Lincoln's attitude toward his officers, and how he worked with them, no matter their feelings of him, or his feelings of them. What I gathered from the book is that no man is above any task or person, no matter how much he paid for his suit. If Lincoln can be shot at on the battle field, managers and bosses can do the menial ""everyday"" tasks of their employees!"
2,like a starstruck child writing about his favorite superhero,"Alright...Abraham Lincoln was a wonderful man, but far from flawless. Unfortunately the author of this text seems to be so awestruck and starstruck with old Honest Abe that he sees every action, every movement, every flicker of Abe's eyelashes as all part of some divinely inspired, ultra-coordinated plan to inspire a nation and lead. Again, Lincoln is a hero and a great man, but he is a man, he had problems and he did make mistakes. This book just ignores all that and sees Lincoln only through very rose colored glasses."
4,Leadership as evidenced by a true leader,"""Lincoln on Leadership"" is a cross between a Lincoln bio and a management primer. Author Donald Phillips said he took Sandburg's Lincoln bio for leisure reading at a week long management seminar and realized Lincoln was the epitome of everything that was discussed. He says leadership is a nebulous and abstract set of guidelines that is difficult to learn without viewing it empirically through someone like Lincoln.Phillips uses Lincoln's presidential years to demonstrate the virtues/techniques of MBWA, honesty and integrity, persuasion, courage, goal-setting, paradox, decisiveness, humility, and sense of humor. I only wish he could have drawn more from Lincoln's pre-presidential years as an example of how a leader is made. This is a short and easy-to-read book that should be a must for any study of leadership."
3,Somewhat trivial,"Bird Noises is an okay EP. The production and sound quality is very good (better than Head Injuries, and much better than Place Without a Postcard). But there are only four songs on the disc, and none are very memorable. The songs are so-so, mediocre.I'd put this at the bottom of Midnight Oil releases to get."
5,replacement for a broken item,"I was given a similar item for Christmas one year and had taken a series of picture for this particular frame. While cleaning the table it was sitting on it fell and shattered. Those pictures meant a lot to me, so I immeadiately went to look on Amazon to find a replacement and found only one, this one. I think it's prettier that the Mikasa that broke. So glad it was available. One man's trash is another man's treasure!"
1,"Awesome vocals, CRUD instruments.","I love Richard Cheese's voice and love his covers. However on this album the ""band"" appears to be nothing but a Casio. On ""Smack My Bitc-H Up"" he calls for the band members to solo and it sounds like a pathetic stumble over the keys to try to emulate actual musicians. His other albums have actual instrumentalists behind the instruments and the difference is clear. They really sound like a nightclub lounge style instead of just a dude in his basement. I mean, maybe the studio he's allegedly suing (I don't know the details) just took his acapellas and put them over the aforementioned midi tracks in order to save money... but you can tell it sounds amateur. Like the other reviewer said, pick up Sunny Side of the Moon instead. Most of the same songs, however, real instruments."
5,Brilliant. Absolutely Brilliant.,"There aren't enough stars to rate this cd. Thanks to Richard Cheese, I like the source materials BETTER now that I've heard this disc.And the version of ""The Rockafeller Skank"" is sublime.Well played, Mr. Cheese. Well played."
5,"Superb, funny, easy listening.","I love this CD!It's funny but also easy listening. I play it all the time, but not when friends are over since the lyrics are a bit offensive in places."
3,Band way to small for being a divers watch,"Mechanically, the watch is great. The only problem is that the band included with the watch is for small wrist men or children. You will have to include the expense of an additional band if you chose to even normally wear it if you are of average build, or as a divers watch."
2,The strap was too short,"The rubber strap is to short and i dont have a huge wrist. Also i was unable to set the date, it always flipped to the next day before 12."
1,Proves Ann Coulter is right.,"Jesus didn't hate. Liberal hypocrites do. Never judge a book by its title.There is nothing liberal about a ""Liberal"". They hate everything and everyone who doesn't think the way they do. Isn't it ironic that the most oppressive states in the Union have been mostly run by ""Liberals"" for years--Massachusetts, Commiefornia, New York, etc, where everything Constituional is against the law for conservatives, and so much that is illegal, like criminal, illegal immigration is the stuff of which ""Liberals"" are made?"
4,"No Thanks, I Prefer To Walk","Deadly Departure by Christine Negroni is a chilling account of the final moments experienced by the crew and passengers TWA Flight 800 and the months spent piecing the evidence together to determine the cause. Through eyewitness testimony, information culled from the wreckage itself by forensic investigators, and interviews with countless officials, Negroni masterfully weaves together the gritty details of the crash while breathing life into each of the passengers. Passengers, men and women and children, whose lives were secondary to corporate profits. Readers will be more than a little reluctant to fly the friendly skies after learning the horrifying facts behind the crash, outraged that it could have been prevented and incredulous to discover that it can happen again."
4,Well worth reading,"Christine Negroni has written a spellbinding account of the TWA flight 800 disaster. While the outcome is known before you begin the book, she successfully weaves together all of the different strands of this disaster -- from the technical, to the human interest, the inter-agency rivalry, and the painstaking detective work. The book will appeal to the lay reader who is not an expert in aviation safety. Given the prevalence of conspiracy theorists who are anxious to debunk this book (and any responsible theories about this disaster) I would read any negative reviews with a huge grain of salt. Read the book and come to your own conclusions. You will be glad you did."
4,Lannaireachd: Gaelic Swordsmanship,I purchased this book for my nephew aged 40. He saw it and others for sale. When he received it he called me to advise that this book was better that the description on the web site and he was very pleased.
1,king who?,"this cd is the worst. i believe that the only reason that there are any sales at all, are due to the front-mans affiliation with the howard stern show. if your looking for real rock stick to 30 Odd Feet of Grunts, Dogstar, or The Losers. now those bands rock....Yeah! (F the FCC)"
5,unVampire who cares,"This book will take you places.Into the heart of a child of darkness. Into the dark world of sanitariums and doctors who take graft. You'll meet millionaires and spoiled rich kids; and you'll meet monsters.In some way, Nancy Collins will make you care about all of them.Their mistakes, their stubborness, and the compassion they do and don't have. You'll meet teachers, mentors, villains, and seamy associates. You'll meet charismatic evil.A book that explodes the ""safe world"" of everyday life with characters that Bram Stoker would never have believed.Essential reading to those who have an interest in the Children of the Night."
3,Entertaining but not outstanding,"Sort of an encyclopedic text on movie obits and mini-bios, with a typical Brit left-leaning approach (read the write up on Ronald Reagan and that becomes obvious.) Many (US) actors you would expect to see are, rather curiously, not listed - and there are many (mostly Brit and European) you've never heard of. Some of the material doesn't agree with more extensive (and presumably, extensively researched) biographies on some of the subjects. The author also seems to devote as much text to sexual preferences and affairs (rather a bit heavy on the gay emphasis) as to the movies the actors appeared in. Then again, what else would you write about in a book of obituaries? Lots of tidbits that make good party conversation. A decent casual read (or scan). In other words, a library loaner. (This is the 3rd edition - 2005)"
4,The legacy of Tupac Shakur,"Although this album is a bootleg that wasn't licenced by the estate of Tupac Shakur, it still succeeds in delivering quality music remixes from the years owned by 2Pac leading up to his untimely death in 1996. What many do not realize is that there a several more Makaveli albums that are also being sold as bootlegs. A fully licened Makaveli album is scheduled to be released in the summer."
3,WORKING TOWARDS A+,"Since I am still reading it, I give it three stars for presentation, which is readable and recommended after trying to navigate through the logical messes Microsoft throws at you when pursuing the MCSE. One error I've found is Chapter 4, summary test question #46 asks, ""Which Switch will cause Win95 setup to forgo the initial disk scan? The answer on page 549 states /id, but the correct answer is /is. So, there's one error and I'm only on chapter 4. Judging from the copy I've already covered, I recommend this book to all serious students who wish to read subject matter presented in a way which doesn't insult your intelligence, or play mind games with obsolete software scenarios, e.g. microsoft mail migration to exchange 5.0 (MCSE test). Have fun! Don't quit!"
5,The best diet ever,"I've gone on this diet years ago and lost weight without hunger or fidgeting. This diet really works. I used to rent it from the library but because its an older book, the library discarded the book. I have searched high and low, and after just becoming a member with Amazon, I've found my life long search for the weight loss I've been looking for. Too bad this book is no longer in print because I believe once its gone, its gone for good. If you are extremely overweight, I suggest that you try this book."
2,A Mere Printing of Famous Twain Quotations,"Mark Twain was an inspiring writer, speaker, and philosopher whose words are of immense value. This book provides a collection of his most famous quotations categorized for your convenience.Books of quotations run the risk of insignificance when little to no unique insight is offered or the quotations are readily available to the public (not unique to the author). This book has issues with both as it merely represents a printing of quotations with no additional content and no exclusivity nor individuality. The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain provided in this book is just as easily discovered with a single Google search, leaving one wondering the purpose of such a simple book."
5,ED OKONOWICZ CONTINUES TO SEND CHILLS DOWN MY SPINE,This book along with his others continue to capture my intrigue and imagination. Ed has a way of telling a story that simply won't let you put the book down until it is done and keeps you in suspense waiting for his next issue.
1,Junk,"I've been through several ""Ironman"" watches and they never last more than a year. The once quality watch manufacturer is producing plastic junk. The last watch I had has moisture in the lens and has quit working. I will NOT buy another running watch from Timex."
1,band worthless,the watch is pretty good overall have had it for just two years but the band is trash what good is a water resistant watch when if the band gets wet the velcro stop holding i dont dive 100's of meters a day but i once in awhile forget to take it off before getting in the shower and i mean i almost always take it off when i shower and i have never put it completely under water but trust me dont get that band wet it will not work if you do i forgot to take it off while washing dishes and it hasn't been the same sences now the band is no good the velcro does not hold and the watch constantly falls off my wrist 100 METERS MY YOU KNOW WHAT !!!!! DO NOT GET IT WET
3,"Nice watch, cheap band","I just received the T5E901 Ironman Triathlon watch. It seems like a nice watch for the price. Being an aging baby boomer, I appreciate the large, easy to read numerals. I am a little disappointed with the Indiglo night display. I was expecting it to be easier to see in the dark. That was my main reason for purchasing a new watch as the night light on my 20-year old Casio no longer works. UPDATE: I am very disappointed with the quality of the band. I've had to replace it twice in 5 years. Unfortunately, the generic bands don't fit properly and I am forced to buy the overpriced Timex band."
5,Timex Watch,Great value for a reliable sports watch with easy to use features. Purchased as can view three time zones instantly .
3,Broke after 5 years,"I had this watch for 5 years and it finally let water seep in and it passed away 2 weekends ago. I wasn't in the water for long and the watched claimed it was water resistant. I would still buy this watch but you might want to buy the Extended 5-year warranty for $5 (warranty is in the instructions). Bummed about a 1-year warranty, but it's a cheap watch. I had to buy another one."
5,Great product!,My husband lost his timex in the ocean while at work and was so sad! He'd had it for a long time and it was still going strong. I bought him the same one for his birthday and he couldn't be happier. This watch will be on his wrist for a lifetime!
4,Amazing early stuff.,"This is early Danny Sullivan who is one of the best young DJ's in the country at this point.I bought this after hearing some of his other newer stuff (under the name Donnie Hotwheel). The guy is truly unreal with his beats and samples. He used to do only house and now is branching out to more mainstream. CAnt wait to see more albums from him !!!Love his stuff, as they seem to get better every record."
5,Love it!!!!,This is my all time favorite fragrance! It is elegant yet can be worn as an everyday scent. I have gone through 3 bottles already and will continue to purchase it! Love it!!!!
1,"Great cast, terrible sound",A great cast and good direction. Unfortunately the quality of sound on our copy renders the tape essentially unusable. The great lines and superb delivery are wrecked by static like an AM radio on a thundery evening. Don't waste your money on it.
5,AWE-INSPIRING,"This is an awesome CD. If you like circuit party music, you will love this. It has alot of high-energy and powerful vocals, especiallly Kim English's new release ""Everyday."" (I think this is the first CD available with ""Everyday"" on it, and that alone makes it worth the buy!) It's like bringing the party home with you."
3,"Eye candy, but not a reference work","This is a translation/reprint of a Musee de l'Armee publication.The anonymously authored introductory text is very brief andoffers little beyond a short history and warning not to takethe plates (less than a 1/3 of the originals) on face value.There is a recommendation for a work on the uniform regulationsthemselves, but, of course, it's in French. There are no noteson the plates.The plates, however, are very well done, and it's well worthpicking up as a remainder, even if it's just a picture book."
2,Stick to the print version,"I bought the Kindle version of ""8000 Miles of Dirt"" hoping to get some ideas for four-wheeling and camping on my frequent trips to Wyoming. While the content looks promising, the Kindle version is crippled by the inability to scale the maps- a huge oversight for a travel guidebook.Each region is introduced by a detailed map of a large swath of the state. These maps are used to look up the routes in the book. I'm sure sure that in the printed version these maps took up an entire page and were easily legible, but on the Kindle the maps render so small as to make them illegible - and there's no way to enlarge them. Finding routes for the region you're interested in is a major pain.Edit: Apparently the graphics in this book are only scalable in the Kindle Fire. If you have an earlier version of the Kindle you can not zoom or pan the graphics. (See discussion below.)"
2,"If you're a 4.0 or above, don't waste your time and money!","I wouldn't waste money purchasing this DVD. The magazine does a better job analyzing your game. The tips are nothing out of the ordinary. The players in the video had a difficult time demonstrating Paul Anacombes points because they weren't consistent enough. If you're a solid 4.0 and above, you're wasting your time and money. The free tips from [...] are more helpful than the DVDs."
2,Lacy J Dalton has a nice voice...,"I bought this album for one particular song. While the singer does have a nice voice...I didn't care for any of the other songs. I found them a bit to ""folksy"" for me."
3,Couple of good songs on this CD.,Didn't really care for most of the songs on this CD but there were a couple of songs I liked.
2,Next time hire a sound engineer,"I'm sorry. I love Rush, but the sound quality on this DVD is bad. The video is fine, but the audio could have been so much better. Play this on a killer system and you will be very disappointed. The vocals are the worst. Not much louder than the excessive crowd noise which is mixed in. If you want to hear how good a live music DVD can be, check out Led Zeppelin. Totally awesome. But I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this. What a shame."
1,Blown Away in a Bad Way!,"First let me say I'm not only a Rush fan but saw them perform live at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in the mid 70s just after they released 2112. Epic! Perhaps my expectations were too high because I expected something at least as good if not better. Instead I heard a muddy rumble that sounded more like a Brontosaurus stampede than a rock concert. Additionally, as loud as the music was, it was mostly drowned out by the fans who sounded like an angry horde at an Italian soccer match. I can't help but wonder why the producers of this video chose to mix the audio with such an emphasis on noise from the stands other than the performance from the band was so messy it needed to be covered up. No setting on my optical surround system made this tolerable. Order this ONLY if your idea of heavy rock is heavy noise."
3,Geddy lost in Sound,Rush in Rio is a great collection of live Rush greats but for the price I paid for this DVD I was let down big time...I found myself concentrating more on trying to hear Geddy Lee's vocals (that are constantly buried by the rest of the band)...Rather than enjoying what could have been a five star masterpiece...I cannot believe the injustice done to the group & fans by releasing this DVD without first seriously listening to the demo!...Don't get me wrong...its Rush at their best...I'm just very bummed out over what could have been!
3,Damn the rain! Damn this sound quality!,"Unfortunately for this DVD, it was the last night of the show and pouring rain all day resulted in some equipment failure which lead the poor sound quality of this recording. No, it's not your system, the sound is just bad. Too bassy and no range whatsoever. Put in another concert DVD or Different Stages to see how a Ruch concert should sound.What a bad show to have audio difficulties on, however! The band looked as though they were having the show of their lives and the Brazilian Rush fans appear to be some of the more knowledgeable fans out there. Rush proves with this performance that they are still, man-for-man, the world's most talented band.***** For the performance and the Band* For the sound quality"
3,Expected better audio quality,I don't need to constantly hear the din of the crowd to know it's a live show. It sounds like someone had the microphones turned towards the audience instead of the band. Aside from that it's a good show with a lot of good classic Rush songs.
4,An Audience Worthy Of My Favorite Band,"Critisisms of this dvd are valid. Audiophiles & epilectics are not going to enjoy this disc. However most other Rush fans are going to revel in it. 40,000 insane Brazilian fans make this a dvd worth having. Crazy people those Brazilians, absolutely nuts. How I wish I'd been there. The 2 disc set is worth paying the few extra bucks for, I really enjoyed the documentary"
5,Worth Every Penny!!,"This is by far the best DVD I own. It's easy for me to say this for the following reasons: I love Rush and everything they do; the two DVDs allow you to see everything that went into the concert and how close they were to not pulling it off; the camera views are absolutely perfect, and many others. My favorite thing about this, next to the music (of course) is the crowd! In this DVD, the crowd is awesome and know everything. I would strongly suggest this DVD or CD set to any Rush fan. They are absolutely awesome in the studio, and they play a little better live, and that says a lot. Peart, Lifeson, and Lee are unbelievable in how hard they work and care about what they are doing. PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT!!"
3,No Anamorphic Video,"Despite what the packaging says, the video is not presented in anamorphic widescreen. Its standard widescreen, which means less than optimal resolution for digital widescreen TV owners.I wouldn't mind if it weren't labeled as being 16x9 anamorphic, which it is not.The audience is a little too loud for my liking as well. More vocals and instruments, less crowd noise would have been better, IMO."
3,RUSH Rocks! But once again ...,"Hello once again, RUSH fans! Too much camera work on the audience. Needed more focus on RUSH! Overall. Good. Buy it! DVD. Once again peeps, tc. Be safe!"
3,Less Than Expected,"The concert itself was great - essentially the same thing I saw here in the US a few months earlier - and worth the price of the DVD.However, I was disappointed with the audio mix - it sounded too compressed making Lifeson's guitar work difficult to pick up in some songs and Peart's drums sound muffled. There was too much emphasis for my tastes on the bass tracks - drums, guitar, and keyboard pedal. And, there was way too much emphasis on crowd noise to the point where it was difficult to clearly distinguish the music in many songs.The video camera angles skipped around too frequently throughout the concert. And, again, way too much footage of the teenagers in the front row doing singalongs and playing air guitar.I was hoping for something along the quality lines of ""The Who and Friends - Live At Albert Hall"" DVD put out a couple years ago. Or maybe, something along the lines of their recent concert here in Atlanta with focus on the band, not the crowd."
3,I expect more from Rush than this!!!,Disappointed that the video is not even DVD quality or resolution. The audio is OK. I should have taken the advice of other reviewers and skipped this one.
2,The BEST RUSH tour in years but DVD does not capture it,"I am long time Rush fan (since 1979). I own almost every album and video. I have seen Rush live many times, and I have to say the Vapor Trails tour was the best Rush tour I have ever seen, but this DVD does not capture that. From the 2nd disk we learn the road crew got to Rio late and that the set up time was ""rushed"". There was no sound check or video check and this shows in this DVD.The audio in not in sync with the video. Also the editing is terrible (Alex soloing and video not on him). Rush should of not filmed in a huge outdoor stadium, an indoor arena would have been better. Were they tring to copy Iron Maiden in Rio? This DVD could of been a lot better. Save your money for the ""Exit Stage Left"" DVD whenever it comes out."
5,a great rush performance,"finally all the excitement I've experienced at ruch concerts is captured on video - the brazilian crowd is amazing and rush feeds off their energy and give a kick ass, all out, raise the cup, head banging, fist pumping great performance - you can tell rush loved playing this concert and as a 20 year rush fan I loved watching it - great setlist - great extras - i can not imagine any rush fan not liking this video - 10 out of 10!!!"
2,"Bad sound, to be endured rather than enjoyed","I've never been a Rush fan, but always felt I could be one. Never owned a Rush album, but heard all the radio cuts, and had seen one awesome, high-energy performance piece on VH1. I bought this DVD on impulse figuring I'd be in for a treat.There was excellent musicianship, good energy from the band and crowd, good camera work. But, the sound was BAD. And, that's bad, since we are talking about MUSIC.Ugh. The audio was muddy, and Geddy Lee's vocals were buried so deep I could not have followed them at all if I had not know words to a third of the songs. It did improve slightly as the concert progressed, but not satisfactorily, as at least one other reviewer, here, stated.I'm surprised the DVD got released in this state."
2,Audio Ruined It,"This could have been a fantastic piece of work for Rush fans. Great quality video and good song selection by the band. However, whoever mixed the sound should lose their job or be shot, maybe both. Garbled muddy sound made this unwatchable to this Rush fan. I recommend R30 instead. Don't waste your money on this."
2,product not as advertised,"This DVD is not formatted in anamorphic widescreen as advertised. I'm returning my copy as soon as possible. It's just shocking that a band like Rush, who has such a reputation for fine music, would let this get past them. They won't even allow you to discuss the issue on Rush's official message board -- why is that? This message board is run by the ""gang"" at PerfektWerks. So they don't want the truth about the product getting out? PerfektWerks has done more to give Rush a black eye than any other entity. So I guess we see how the honest man really IS the most endangered species.Finally, the editing on the show is way too quick. If you appreciated the fine work of Derivative Inc on the concert animations, you'll find little of it represented here.Unfortunate that Rush fans have waited so long for a DVD and now get this inferior product."
1,i gonna send it back,in my whole DVD collection this DVD got the WORST 5.1 sound.get this DVD only if you play it through a standalone tv and dvd player.
3,Don't buy it for the concert footage.,"Buy it for the documentary.After much anticipation and waiting, I popped the DVD into my home theater system and cringed at the audio quality. It's HORRIBLE! Way too much crowd noise. Forget about hearing Alex. He's absolutely missing from the mix. If not for the excellent and highly enjoyable documentary by band photographer Andrew McNaughton, this DVD would be a bust.It pains me to write this. I love this band and have come to expect more. Sadly, this DVD will likely be relegated to the ""back"" of my collection, only to be played when I want to revisit the documentary or Neil's solo. If you're a RUSH fan, go ahead and buy it. It's worth the 20 bucks just to get a glimpse of the personalities of Lerxst, Dirk and Pratt.To all you die-hard RUSH fans who are pissed off at the negative reviews: Sorry...we're just being honest. ""We"" being myself and many other fans who have remarked on the poor audio quality."
3,Should have been better,"You can forgive them for production quality in ""Replay"" due to the technology. But I don't care what anyone says, leaving all the crowd noise in this release is unforgiveable. It ruins the entire concert, which I can tell was spectacular. Lifeson should be shot for his production on this. Just because the Brazilian fans sang along to YYZ doesn't make it cool. Buy R30 instead, its way better!"
5,awsome dvd but cant figure out special features,HAS ANYONE CLEVERLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO OPEN UP THE EASTER EGGS ON THE DVD? IS IT OLD CONCERT FOOTAGE OR DOCUMANTARY? WOULD LOVE TO KNOW. ALSO WHICH DISC IS IT ON?
1,Headache a happening..,"Wow, who messed this one up?? This dvd was very unpleasent to the eyes and it gave me a headache after about 5 minutes of viewing... 2 second flashes of music scenes.. What the heck is going on here? Just when you are trying to focus on a scene.. it changes.. stupid.They had a perfect opportunity and they blew it.. Whoever created this dvd should take photography 101.. I guess you could use this video for a kind of Chinese water torture thing.Except this one is for the eyes.."
2,bad sound,"I think that their sound[ on stage and in the studio] is getting worse. I absolutely agree with ""gangarunner"" and i'm really disapointed by RUSH. Their last album has no individuality and sounds distorted. I am musician and i used to be abig fan."
3,not that bad,seen the boys twice on the vapor trails tour this year 11 times since 75 this dvd is ok. at best. 22 cameras gave the producers too much footage to take from and it shows. the sound isnt the best but depending on your equipment ( mine is harmon kardon pushing infinity) you can set the delay on your rear speakers and kill the crowd noise.the extras on dvd 2 bring back fond memories of a pretty wild time. anyone who gives this dvd less than 3 stars has no taste in music or no taste in audio equipment. enjoy it !
5,Simply Awesome,"This DVD is Awesome. The musicianship of these three guys is incredible. I've seen them live before, and saw them live again on the Vapor Trails tour in Salt Lake City. I was dumbstruck then, and am again after watching the Rio show from this DVD. All I can say is if you are a Rush fan as I am, this is a must have. The set list is perfect. The addition to The Pass on this tour was awesome as it's one of my favorite Rush tunes. Definately a must have. *****"
4,Satisfied,"Very happy with this new sport watch. Attractive case and band. Keeps very good time. Case diameter,thickness are not oversized -which I prefer for my smaller wrist. Day/date settings are somewhat difficult to configure and Instuctions misleading."
4,Great listening music,Just about every song on this album you find yourself dancing in your seat or belting out the tunes in your car. It is very easy listening and you can understand the words. That is very important. The musical background is great and the vocals and back up vocals all go very well together. I don't find myself listening to much more than this CD when I am in my car. Very refreshing from all the same music played on the radio these days.
5,Lareau changes,If he had an agent this would be rated better than it is now.The CD was late in release. Was anticipated to have beenreleased at an earlier date. The response would have beenbetter.
1,"If only ""zero stars"" were an option....","I should have known it was a bad sign when the software and its package didn't even agree on the title. (Is it ""Pool Shark,"" or ""Billiard Collection?"")As it turns out, the physics are awful, the playability is non-existent, and although the help files include the correct rules, nobody seems to have shared them with the programmers. (Hint: If you're creating a pool game, you should know that combination shots are legal, and that you lose the game if you scratch sinking the eight ball.)I paid all of $2.99 for this game... and I want my money back!"
2,I am disappointed.,"This is the first book in my life with so many errors. And the quality of picturs are not good, they are too small and not instructive. Information is not comprehensive in many cases."
5,It's worth it!,"This Lapinator works really well and it is comfortable. I thought it would hurt my legs, but it actually makes my laptop feel lighter. I'm glad I got it."
4,Great laptop desk,"I bought this on Amazon back in January 2007. I love it-use it almost every day. Very light weight and helps my legs cool. I have a mac book pro and got the 18"" I could fit the mouse on the space but choose not too-almost too tight to fit the laptop-(15"") and a mouse.I highly recommend this product."
1,Flimsy and uncomfortable,"We purchased the Lapinator Plus for $30 plus shipping, as well as the jumbo ""Microbead"" lap desk for half that price ($15.99). The microbead desk has a much thicker molded plastic top; the microbead filled base pad conforms to your lap much better and is more comfortable; it's 2 inches wider, 1 inch longer, and accomodates my widescreen laptop better; and it has two pencil wells and a clip on one end so it can be used for a lap desk without the computer: Again, all for half the price of the Lapinator. The Lapinator Plus has a flimsy, light weight piece of vinyl for a top, a stitched edge, and an uncomfortable foam base that puts my legs to sleep. Buyer beware! Check out the microbead lap desk first."
3,Ok for occasional use.,"I have one under my 17"" notebook. The top surface warped immediately. Lapinator includes rubber feet that you can stick to the top to raise the notebook away from the warped parts. You'll need them. Leg padding is good for about 30 minutes of use before becoming uncomfortable, especially with a larger notebook like mine. I need to get off the couch more anyway."
3,Great Attitude!! Poorly Written!!!,"This is a wonderful book, with a wonderful underlying philosophy. It does the Knock 'Em Dead! approach two or three better. And I am in complete agreement with the attitude that a job candidate should be willing and able to prove he or she can do the job.But this is not a 200 page book. Even given a certain amount of repetition for emphasis, this should be 50-60 pages tops. How many times can you say ""research"" or ""be prepeared to show you can do the job"" ?Save the money for bus fare to your one or two interviews that will result in getting the job you want!"
2,Disappointing,"Good idea, but unfortunately it was simply repeated over and over again. And no examples! I was intrigued how a knowledge worker in today's economy would ""do the job"" in an interview and instead only got, If you're a shoemaker, make shoes. Completely unhelpful. Also, vague directions as to show how you'd ""do the job"" including, drawing charts and arrows. Of what? It made it sound like the whole ""presentation"" was a gimmick. By the end, I didn't have a clue as to how I could do the job in an interview. And since the writer seems familiar with the Internet economy from his credentials, it seemed like he would have some useful guidelines. Good premise, annoying book."
3,Doesn't handle Schedule K-1,"Got this because it was a great price. Handled almost everything, but barfed on a schedule k-1. Which meant that I couldn't e-file. However, H&R; Block was prompt to refund the purchase price.I don't really care much for the UI features or the ""interview"" feature (also found on TurboTax) - I only want to enter forms that I have quickly and easily.I would recommend this for those who have simple to slightly complex returns."
3,Failed to E-file state return,"I switched from Turbo Tax to Tax Cut this year. Data import was flawless and other functions were also good. However, it failed to e-file my NJ state return because ""it was not able to account for wash-sale rules"" - whatever that means.I am very disappointed and should get a partial refund on my purchase."
5,Best polarizing filter I ever had,"Before I bought this filter, I read reviews describing the different quality levels that Hoya offers, and since the top of the line came at a price not too much above the intermediate, I decided to give it a try.It turned out to be a good decision. The contrast this filter provides is better than anything I have seen before. If you aim at a water surface at the right angle, it virtually goes from total reflection to see through. The mechanical quality is very good as well. I definitely recommend spending the extra money on this filter."
4,Desire in the sun,This book took me 3 days. I was not able to let it down. Always kept me wondering what was to happen next. It was a nice romantic story with alot of suspence. I recommend it to anyone that love Karen Robards.
5,What A Read!,"Immune by Cheryl Gray is one heck of a good read. Set in the future, Immune offers us a glimpse into a pharmaceutically controlled society where only two percent of the population remember how the world used to be. The idea that human beings can be altered in such a way is both terrifying and alarming, and that is the point of the story. This book truly hit home with me. It is a wake up call for all of us to fight for and retain our individuality. The idea of a pill that will solve all problems is frighteningly real, and the author is sending us an important message here. I highly recommend Immune. The character depiction is vivid, the flow of the story is smooth, and the dialogue is real. The premise will intrigue you, and the ending will surprise you."
5,Very comfortable,These are the most comfortable flip flops I have have ever worn. I highly recommend them. I have had them about 2 months and they are still very soft.
5,So Good I Keep Buying Them,"I wear sandals about 6 days out of the week from April until September. I work, walk my dog, work out, and basically everything else in sandals.With that said, I bought a pair of these 2+ years ago. They were the most comfortable thing I ever slipped on my foot. After 2 years of almost daily use the sole was pretty much worn out.So, I bought the exact same pair. I'm breaking them in now, but it's nice to know that the sizing/comfort hasn't changed."
1,Not so Hot!,"I have read a few different translations of The Book of Five Rings and I have to say that this one is confusing. It seems obvious that the writer has no real understanding of the ways of the Martial Arts. I really loved The Unfettered mind and was expecting a lot from this book, but it just didn&#65533;t deliver. The concepts are blurred and presented in a shallow non specific manner. There is a lot on religion although Musashi said that he did not use religious ideas in his strategy. In every other translation I have read there is a strong epiphysis on practical martial arts practice, but this one seemed elusive and flighty. I just didn&#65533;t care for it.If you want to read Musashi I recommend the book by Victor Harris, A Book of Five Rings."
5,The Book of Five Rings,This book is a classic done in the CD format. It was written by Miyamoto Musashi and translated by William Scott Wilson. It was recorded by Scott Brick.I am so happy to have this CD formated version of The Book of Five Rings. This gives me an opportunity to go over the wisdom of Musashi's works. I can sit back and relax and ponder the wisdom it contains. Thank you so much Amazon for making it available in this format.
5,Very Cool,I think that this is his very best that he put out. I have never been to any of his concerts yet. But I am looking forward to the next one he does. I really like listening to the cds because I think he is a very good singer. He is the one that bought me to country. Ever since I saw the Central Park special on HBO. I hope he come out of his break soon and does a concert near me SOON.
1,A great sample of a Garth concert.,"Of all his albums, this one is probably the one most catered to the ""Garth-o-holic"". With the extra verses, the fan sing-a-long, this truely captures the audistic feeling of a G-man concert."
2,Obviously one for the fans,"This is one of those cd's that you'll love if you're a fan and hate if you're not. It won't win anyone over. Garth has strayed so far from what I heard on his first couple of albums. He seemed so sincere and real then. Now it's like one big marketing gimmick after another. It's quite sickening to me. But he's the multi-millionaire and I'm not so what do I know? As far as the music on this disc goes, I agree with the person who said the sound quality is poor. And I just hate it when the artist stops singing and lets the audience sing. We don't pay to hear fans sing, we pay to hear the artist."
3,a fan due to my daughter,"my oldest daughter (32)LOVES country i have no idea where she got it from because i am a late 60's beatles grateful dead and that era. anyways, i bought the double cd and really love it except for the hearing the actual songs. i went out and bought the studio recorded cd and while i can understand everything there is something lost, the excitement and all. can't we clone these together to get the long versions of the thunder rolls and friends in low places without losing the actual words due to the fever pitch of the crowd.?thanks"
1,His Worst Yet!,"This recording of live songs shows his uncanny ability to sing off-key. The songs themselves were great hits, but these recordings are not easy to listen to."
5,The fans are what keep him going!,"Garth has done it again. When I first heard of this CD I thought it was going to be just another ""hits"" and wasn't too excited. When I finally got to listen to it, I had to have it. The audience makes the music come to life. Garth is his true self when he has 50,000 screaming fans surrounding him. I'd also like to add to those who think that Garth is ""EGO BROOKS"" to get over it. You people are just jealous that you'll never be as rich, famous, handsome, or as great of a singer as the man himself....GARTH."
5,Garth Brooks Is Phenominal.,I love this ablum. It showed the true Garth Brooks. The way he interacts with his audience. I went to see him in Las Vegas and I was stunned. He put on a absolutely great show. I LOVE YOU GARTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,GREAT CD!!,Garth is the man!! This CD is awesome!! It really makes you think you are at a live performance. It's a must buy.
4,It's all about Garth,"This CD is just typical Garth Brooks. In fact, it's almost the same CD as The Hits (just arranged in a different order). I would've liked to have had more songs from Fresh Horses and Sevens rather than the older ones that were already on The Hits. However, the songs are still good and sound great live. The standout songs are the amazing crowd sing-a-longs Unanswered Prayers and The Dance. Also, finally, we get to have the new and complete versions of Tomorrow Never Comes and Friends in Low Places. These four songs are enough to make me want the CD but with all the other hits this CD turns into a must have."
5,This CD showed me how much his fans really love him.,"Garth Brooks is very, very talanted. His music makes you dance in any way. He can really ster up an audience too. Like the gig in Central Park, that had to be the best I saw of his performance. I hope someday to be like him.This man has to be the most talented man in music on the face of this planet. The way he always changes his appearance is awsome too! From the Go-T to the Baby Face, that was a big change. He is my Idal, and I am his biggest fan."
5,good as it gets,This CD Is the graetest ever Garth Brooks is the best country musician ever (after the Man in Black of course) I highly recomend it
2,More Hype from the King of Marketing,"If ever a song showed that Garth Brooks voice is truly mediocre, it would have to be ""It's Your Song"". The beginning of this song sounds like an amateur on karaoke night. True, Garth has had some fun ""ditties"" over his career, but for the most part, he is the result of relentless hype both by himself and the recording industry. As pop music goes, Garth's songs are fun, but he should hardly be held in the esteem he is. And this (double) album shows us just why."
3,An excellent read,"This book is much better than the previous two, although they were both decent books. The story builds the depth of the main character, Shira Calpurnia, and maintains continuity with the prior stories.The story is essentially a murder-mystery as the book description and other reviews have stated. My only criticism is that the author does not take the time to introduce some of the smaller characters, and it can get a little confusing keeping track of who the smaller characters are. A 'cast of characters' / 'dramatis personae' at the front of the book would have been helpful."
2,Longwinded,"I loved the ""Dracula Tapes"" take on the vampire legend. Book #2 was slightly interesting. The series have rapidly detiriorated since them however. This is a longwinded novel, badly written, badly edited, with the characters that are impossible to care about. It is hard to follow the plot in its full if you do not have the background in the past books. I am severely disappointed."
4,good book,"I have read the first 100 pages of the book. The author assumes that you know something about programming, so it is not for absolute beginners. As long as you know the basics of progamming you should be fine. The book is divided into 2 sections: Core Python and advanced topics( regular expressions, network programming, Web programming, and threads, etc). He starts off with a crash course in python covering all major topics of python. Then he covers the topics in detail. I have read other python books before and this one is by far the best. The author is a very good writer. He writes in a very clear and logical manner. The topics are covered thorougly. I haven't seen many errors in the text, so that's good."
3,"Great drive, terrible software, non-existant tech support","The title says it all: I like the drive (and carry it in my briefcase for data transfer).The software that came with it doesn't install on my fairly vanilla laptop. Good thing I don't need it to use the drive.Attempts at customer service have been a 100% total waste of time. No answer to my questions about the software at all.Oh, and the package says the cable that comes with the drive is 22"" long. It's not, mine is about 7"". A longer cable won't work."
1,2 failed WD drives within 6 months.,DO NOT BUY -- I had two WD drives fail within 6 months. I'd give this zero stars if it were an option.RUN from this company.
4,Does what is should do,"This smart mobile HD does what it should do: it saves data effectively and is fast. Besides, it is small, quite and looks cool. Though, it uses quite some energy from your laptop battery while running on battery only."
5,Sleek Stylish and Sturdy,"Very good product to buy. Can easily fit into my pocket. Looks so stylish for a harddisk, would rather qualify for a classy cigarrete case. ;). No hassles of carrying long wires and power adapters. instantly connects and fast transfers - 80 gigs took around an hour to transfer."
1,Doesn't work without a seperate power supply.,"The fine type on the package reads, ""a special cable is available for the few computers that restrict bus power"". That should actually read, ""MOST computers restrict bus power"". Much research has revealed that USB specs max the power at 500mA -- and this requires more. Therefore, it shouldn't work EVER. (if it does, it's because your computer supplies more than it's supposed to.) It would be great if it did."
2,"Western Digital 160 GB USB 2.0 Passport 2.5""",I used this Hard Drive for one week and I had to return it. They sent a new Hard Drive to me immediately
3,Good Hard Drive...But dont Drop It,"I bought this hard drive because it was on sale for 89.99 for the 160GB. I have external WD drives and they work great. I used this for about a month and it worked great. It was perfect for transporting my school work and my other work. One day I dropped it about 2-3' from from truck. I picked it up and it had a small scuff on it. I didnt think anything of it. I later plugged it into my computer and the computer did not recognize it. The HD powered on and started to spin. I then went into the disk utility to try and formatt it. The drive read 2TB!!!!!. I couldnt get it to work, It gave me an ""input/output error"". So to sum it all up, dont drop this drive!!! other than that it worked good."
5,Awesome...,"I have a 250GB WD MyBook hard drive. Bought this one for its compactness. Though I was wary of buying this product after reading about the power surge issues, I still went ahead. I think I have made a good decision. It worked well on my Toshiba laptop and on my dad's HP laptop. So far so good."
1,Bummer....but I'm not surprised,"I got this drive for Christmas, and then proceeded to read the reviews about what utter junk this thing was. But I figured I'd give it a shot anyway. It worked well for the few times I've used it over the course of the last month or so, but it just decided to stop working. I had files on there, but now Windows is just telling me I need to format it, which is funny.....because I already did. I'd be more upset if I hadn't been expecting this based on the barrage of negative reviews I've already read. Refund time!"
2,Small and cute but not worth it so far,"Uggh, I really want to like this drive, especially considering that half the reason I bought this was for the name. The other reason I bought it was because I wanted something that fit well into my purse, and it's an added plus that the cable also fits my Blackberry Pearl.However, I too have power issues. It doesn't like my USB port, it has to plug directly into the iMac. I figure I can live with that over having to carry a bulky power cord around, but neither my PC or my Mac want to read files directly from it, I have to pull them back down onto the internal hard drive before it can read them. That's probably a power issue too but why am I going to waste time convincing customer service that I need another cable?! Looks like it's back to Best Buy for this little sucker. Maybe I will get that Blueberry drive."
5,very good,"very good.muy recomendable.advisable, I have one of 60 gb that came out me excellent.I wait that this it leaves me equally"
5,Good Drive,"I have an Inspiron 8600 that I bought back in '04. Rarely do I have the small problem of the Power Surge, which only happens when I do not plug it in smoothly into the USB port. To fix it I just plug it in again. Small inconvenience with the drive, but other than that it serves its purpose well."
1,No good,"This is a very unreliable product. The first one I got didn't work out of the box - it would continuously accumulate disk errors until it had to be reformatted. I exchanged it and its replacement has worked for maybe 2 months or so, until suddenly it stopped and can no longer be accessed on any computer.Even when the thing was working it wasn't that great. The WD Synch software it is bundled with is terrible - one of the least usable software packages I've tried in a while. I ended up just using MS Briefcase to copy and update files. Briefcase isn't the best either, but it was a workable solution until it broke."
5,Great Product,This meets all my expectations for a wok. It did have a heavy film that is tough to get off at the beginning but after getting it removed and seasoned this thing is awesome.
1,Trite isn't even the word...,"Amateur music, and growth stunted lyrics betray the plastic nature of what is called ""dancehall"" these days... We're far from the days when love freedom and peace were the beautiful fabrics from which reggae was woven... now hate and stupidty rule this album... thanks but no thanks"
4,At Last - the Answers!,"I'm pretty stupid when it comes to solving Myst, Riven and Exile. I find it unbelievable that some folks claim they can solve these by themselves. If you want the solution, or partial solution, here's the book for you. I know I couldn't have finished without it."
5,help is here!,"This book SAVED ME!!!! i am a BIG myst etc. fan. I think the puzzles in exile are harder than in riven or myst, so i was STUCK IN J'NANIN!!!! luckily, my dad bought this book! so I was saved. it's actually a very interesting book to read, weather you're on exile or not."
5,The Best Strategy Guide I Have!!!,"I have multiple Guides, including riven and myst and some other games, but this was the most thorough of them all, its great, I highly reccomend it!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I was scepticle on the reviews myself and bought the Magellan RoadMate GPS Dash Mount and adjusted it to fit on my dashboard and after about a mile of driving, the mount was dancing accross my dashboard. I tried to put one of those ""Dashboard Grabbers,"" you know the thing that keeps your coffee cup, sunglasses and in some cases an ash tray on the dashboard, and it still left attended area on my dash. I just ajusted my windshield mount a little different and have not had one bit of trouble. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!"
4,Works as designed,"Pros: Very stable and easily portable. I travel alot so it makes it easy to move around my Roadmate 300.Cons: I thought I could easily detach the Roadmate from the mount and store it in my Roadmate pouch, but the mount connects directly to the back of the Roadmate. As a result, unless I unsrew the mount, the pouch is useless as it won't fit."
1,Not necessary for mounting GPS,"I only give this a 1 because it was so bulky and heavy. Also, I only ordered this because I didn't realize a window mount was included in the Magellen GPS. THis item was heavy and bulky, so I shipped it back. Amazon was good with their return though."
1,Dreadful! Don't even think about it!,"Unless you might enjoy driving with one hand on the steering wheel while the other keeps the mount from sliding off the dash, forget about this as a solution to your RoadMate mounting needs.The thing is more of a hazard to my safety and the safety of my RoadMate than anything else. This is a flawed design. The ""slip-free"" feet are anything but - which leaves your RoadMate flying into the back seat on your next application of the brakes, and sliding down the dash the rest of the time. Unless you are prepared to affix some Velcro or other adhesive to your dash, this has no purpose being called a ""mount"".I'm going back the the windshield mount, you should stick with it too, and save your money - until they come up with something effective."
1,Don't waste your money.,I only used it 3 days and went back to the original window mount. Everytime I turned I had to hold it to keep it from sliding across the dash and into the floor.
4,Best Mount I've Seen,The weighted dash mount works well in my fleet of family cars. It conforms well to the top of the dashboard and holds my Magellan RoadMate GPS unit well. No annoying bounce like the OEM suction-cup windshield mount and makes moving it from vehicle-to-vehicle a snap.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I will have to take the four screws loose and remove the adapter from the mount when I travel and take it in a rental car. If it were fitted with a quick-mount adapter like the factory mount it would be nearly perfect.
2,Cute but incomplete book about saying goodbye,"The little bear says goodbye to his old house. But the book is about an ENDING in life, and doesn't talk about the BEGINNING of what's to come. This book is sad, I think."
5,One of the best natural history books ever written,"Before Peter Benchley scared everyone out of the water with his 1974 novel ""Jaws,"" Peter Matthiessen was writing eloquently about the Great White shark, the apex predator of the oceans. The film ""Blue Water, White Death"" was based on this book. His writing, along with the journals kept by diver Valerie Taylor, make this a must-have book for anyone interested in marine biology."
4,Colorful Irish Swashbuckler,"Excellent and colorful swashbuckler filmed entirly in Ireland. Beautiful scenery filmed in County Wicklow just outside Dublin. Hudson (with an Ok Irish brogue) is the fictitious Captain Lightfoot who alongside his mentor Captain Thunderbolt (Jeff Morrow) give the occuping British forces in Ireland plenty of headaches. Exciting action and chases throughout highlighted by a terrific prison break from a castle.Besides Hudson, the lovely Barbara Rush, Jeff Morrow and Britisher Finley Currie the rest of the entire cast is fleshed out with the cream of Irish players who add greatly to it.The DVD is superb! In glowing color and a sharp clean 2.35 widescreen. This was one of Universal's first Cinemascope efforts and they went all out to make it a good one."
4,A work of a genius? I'd say so.,"Eggers' Heartbreaking Work was truly a work of genius. He takes you through what would be thought of as a tragedy and turns it into that of a comedy. This memoir takes you through Eggers' newly acquired role of a parent, a result of both his parents dying of cancer. He is forced into taking care of his younger brother ""Toph"". Using wit and satire he portrays himself as someone who needs no pity, and is someone who anyone can relate to. He lets the reader into personal, and somewhat random, thoughts that many writers usually edit out of their stories. Through his very interesting (and humorous) preface as well as thoughts displayed throughout the book, he seems to show a bit of embarrassment at having written the book in the first place, and apologizes to his reader. This sarcastic ranting of a memoir is incredibly entertaining and definitely going on my list of favorites."
4,"at times, hilarious","When I first read this book, I was on a bus and kept laughing out loud. I'd have to cover my mouth so people wouldn't stare. There are moments of brilliance in his autobiographical work, but other times where he is self-indulgent...melodramatic perhaps. He even admits to using his parents' deaths as a potential springboard to getting on the Real World (unsuccessfully). That being said, there's a lot here that I loved reading. Anyone who can find humor amongst pathos is a writer I enjoy (David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest comes to mind). It's not a novel, so don't look for a traditional plot or satisfying closure. It's a part of his life, seen through his very humorous eyes."
3,"Promising writer, but relies too much on attitude","Eggers understands the power of language and composes resonant descriptions of common life happenings-e.g. the contents of an odd glance out the window at the winter sky. This is the book I would have written in my twenties in terms of tone. Reading his, I am glad I did not. It's a great piece of descriptve writing and it's helpful in relating the chaotic feelings common to people who lose loved ones. But 300+ pages of this 20-something's coming of age is just too much information about someone who seems irritating and self-absorbed and codependent. And acknowledging one's own propensity towards these traits does not make the person lovable. And he never came of age by the end of the book! But he is clever enough with turning a phrase to keep you turning the page. I just wish I could have thrown the book at him after I was done."
4,Funny and Honest,"I loved this book it was hilarious, his self concious ramblings are so much similar to my own that I couldn't NOT love hearing some of my own inner workings and obsessions. And his honesty and intentions..for example when he's talking about going to a parent teacher interview meeting he confesses he was hoping to ""pick up"". Its a great book, an interesting read, that can be kind of slow in parts but overall its just fun..defintely a must get."
4,Worth the time and money,"This book was refreshing and a good read. Well done Dave. I've always considered myself an orphan. My parents although divorced passed away within a year of each other when I was in my early 20's. My father left behind two young sons just like Dave and his ""little"" brother. This was a refreshing and interesting book. So, Dave didn't discover the cure for cancer or anything like that, but this book speaks of youth and survival, and most important is the true picture he paints of the relationship between two brothers. I recommend this book. HJK"
3,Fun For All,"The irrepressible, always cynical, David ""Dave"" Eggers goes on a wild romp through his own traumatized suburban Chicago past to find glory and fame. This book is further evidence that the discrete application of the word ""cancer"" will allow you to get away with anything. I found the most compelling character in the book to be Dave's hopelessly enguardianed brother, Toph, who often seems to have the appealing audacity to wonder what his brother is so worked up about. Meanwhile, the author is unable to deliver on his promise of HEARTBREAKING, perpetually distancing himself from pain with near-constant self pity and perfect irony. Read it. It's fun. But it may not leave an entirely satisfactory aftertaste in your mouth."
4,"Staggering Genius? No, but . . .","All the superlatives from the reviews printed on the back cover are true: the book is ""exhiliarating and hilarious"" (NY Times), it does ""evoke the terrible beauty of youth"" (Washington Post), it even ""walks the line between self-conscious and self-devouring"" (Boston Globe). And yet (to add more self-somethings) it is also self-indulgent and self-congratulating. There is certainly truth and depth of feeling in this barely-fictionalized memoir of a 21-year-old who loses both his parents and has to assume guardianship of his 9-year-old brother. There is great amusement in reading an author whose word-games begin even in the small print of the colophon page. But read even a couple of pages ofTHE CATCHER IN THE RYE, which is surely the sourcebook for this kind of flippant youthful narrative, and you find a kind of taut economy that Eggers has not yet mastered."
3,Not bad if you're bored,"This was not a bad little book, but it was not good either nor was it pulitzer prize finalist quality. It really seems at times like Eggers was pulling a fast one on us as readers. He writes constantly about using the tragedies of his life to get what he needs and wants and it seems to me like he's done it again. This pathos laden book has forced its way into people's hearts because they feel almost guilty not liking it or at least admitting they don't like it. This is not to say this book's not without its good points, but they're like Keraouc's good points. They crop up suddenly out of self-indulgent, journalistic autobiography and then fade just as quickly. A book to read if you've got nothing else to do but if you want a true heartbreaking work of staggering genius that won't guilt you into lauding it read Anne Karinina."
2,Less than loved it,"I was spurred to read this book by a rave review from a friend, but I have finally given up and won't be finishing the book. I can't say that I hated it, and wouldn't even tell people not to read it. I just didn't enjoy the main character (the author), I felt a cross between ambivilance and irritation with him. I think that someone that felt more of a connection with his style would really get a kick out of this book, but it wasn't for me. I guess I have always worked really hard in my life, and was put off by his irresponsible parenting and lifestyle choices. But like I said, give it a shot and decide for yourself!"
3,Perhaps the humor hides the simplicity?,"This is clearly a ""laugh out loud"" book. If you enjoy a book that nicely mixes humor with a truly tragic/uplifting story, then you should find this engaging. However, the author's own titular pronouncement notwithstanding, this is a fairly simple tale simply told. I recommend it for everyone who has ever wondered how they would survive if their parents were gone tomorrow. Be prepared for some juvenile humor mixed in with the more insightful comments."
1,The title should have been my clue,"This was a book club pick and that is the only reason I read it. Truly the worst book I read in years. A 'pity party' by the author. Then again, maybe this is how most twenty somethings view the events in the fabric of their lives and I am just way 'over the hill.'"
3,Unique,"Indeed, it's a unique book, with exceptional frills, and a rare story. His random thoughts were expressed without filter it stunned me. An honest book, with some points being too elaborated. You may be bewildered by his instructions (funny they are), but I did regret not following on of them."
2,so so so what,"Dave had a number of bad breaks, but his over wrought, over written navel gazing is mind numbing. He suffers from the need for a good, thorough editing. After reading some of his nonsense, I reached the point where I didn't even care about the tragic events in his life, but wanted to give him a good shake. His little brother needs the services of a good lawyer to get back all the money which should have been used for him, but seems to have been poured into the sink hole of ""Might""."
2,another lose-weight-fast gimmick,"Dave Eggers talks a good game, and he writes a funny one, but do we really need another novel-cum-advertisement for non-stick cooking spray? After all, our forefathers got by on hand-pressed oils and churned butter in cooking, and their average lifespans were... well, let's not go there. And, more disappointing, Eggers advocates the use of FIVE TIMES the recommended intake of MSG THREE TIMES A DAY! The book, hailed as an optional buy for my beginning Chinese class to help us remember character stroke order, has caused my pores to swell with artificial lubricants and my saucepans and glass bakeware to all but disintegrate in the dishwater... but I have lost two pounds since I started his diet."
3,A Pointless Read...,"I appreciate and laughed at Dave's unique take on how to preface (and title) a novel. In fact, I enjoyed it along with his personable style. But when I finished ""Heartbreaking Work..."" I was troubled by one overwhelming thought: I'm not sure what I was supposed to have learned from him.There were points in the book where I was in fact compelled to give up on him, as he plodded through the story of his life in intimate, vivid (and often exaggerated) detail in an effort to search for a reason why he was telling us the story of his life in such detail. By the middle of the book I no longer played the game of trying to figure out fact from fiction as I begged the author to give me something to bite into; to argue about; to learn from.Unfortunately, though, Eggers failed to deliver. He is a very good writer but ultimately this book is a stylistic success and a thematic failure."
1,A Not So Staggering work of Genius,"Although the plot to this book has potential, I found that Eggers put me to sleep with his boring characters and story line. I usually force myself to finish a book, no matter how terrible, I'm often overtaken with guilt when I finally decide to close a book without reading it from cover to cover. However, I couldn't even force myself to finish this sleepy, pathetic, and ultimately uninteresting novel."
2,I don't get the hype,"I was given this book as a gift, and I forced myself to read the whole thing. I kept telling myself it must get better since everyone seems to rave about it as if it was the 20-something book of the century. I found it to be boring, poorly written, and pointless. I know we all have different tastes in literature, but I really can't understand why people think this book is somehow deep or moving. I realize it is purposely self-indulgent (the point of an autobiography), but that self-indulgence didn't work for me at all. I never felt for this character, even though he'd been through such tragedy. Believe me, I tried to feel for him, but I just couldn't."
4,Very Compelling,"Even though the author indicates in the preface that the middle section could be skipped, I couldn't do it. Although I was about 30 years older than the author when my parents died within 10 months of each other I found myself drawn to and identifying with his reactions. And recognized the additional complexity of his coming of age at the same time as having become his brother's parent. This book was well worth the time of reading--you don't often see a memoir or autobiography by someone so young who has such insight."
4,"Really, really funny.",Don't be put off by the title. This book is worth reading because you'll spend a lot of it laughing out loud and wanting to read it to your friends.
3,a disappointing work of ambitious intent,"Eggers takes a lot of chances with the autobiographical format, but this book is ultimatly unsatisfying. There are moments of brilliance, but most of these are tucked away in the addendums and notes in the preface. Eggers uses language cleverly and the imagined conversations are someof the most reavealing sections of the text. I may have enjoyed the book more if the last few pages didn't insult the reader's intelligence."
4,"Odd, but interesting","This is a very unusual book, written in an odd style that is, in the end, rather effective. It's easy to tell that a lot of the conversations in this ""non-fiction"" work never happened, for some of the sentences supposedly coming out of the mouth of the author's young brother are absolutely impossible to imagine. Interestingly, the author admits that much of this work is thoroughly overwritten and exaggerated, for whatever reason. This book is a big best seller, which makes me wonder what people see in it to compell them to purchase. I liked reading it, but I think that I probably would not have bought it (probably because of the pretentious title) if it hadn't been as commercially successful as it has. I got it just to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm happy I bought and read it, for under all the artifice and affectation is a real, honest ""heartbreaking"" story, even if I don't believe there is any ""staggering genius"" accompanying it."
2,Not worth all the hype.,"Aside from the few humorous instances, I found this book rather laborious. The author is arrogant and just a flat out smart-alec...but that doesn't make for a good book.I have read better."
5,Breaking the Heart of My Ingeniously Staggered Egg,"This is a useful novella for travellers... it epitomizes Kerouac's vision of all books ""quoting my book, ON THE ROAD."" The author's tone of terse yet supple teacher covers such a plethora of topics, including coping with civil suits, the CHEERS&JEERS section of TV GUIDE, and the effect ecstasy may or MAY NOT have on the spinal chord fluid. As commanded in William Strunk's ""THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE,"" Eggers 'omits needless words! Rule Seventeen, omit needless words!' No need for simply vulgarities here, either. Brevity is the truncated spice of life. This one is steaming, with paprika and everything!The author does so much and does it oh-so-beautifully, in a book I read in about ten minutes while at the chiropractor's office, no less. Pick it up at a medical practitioner's office near you."
2,Buy a stapler instead,"There's a trick with a stapler in this book's illustrations, and it pretty much sums up Eggers's writing strategy. That is: he shows you a drawing of a stapler, then admits it's a shameless grab for attention (look! he can draw a stapler!). If you fall for it, you're impressed by how honest he is about trying to distract you with a drawing of a stapler. If you don't fall for it, you realize that it doesn't matter whether Eggers admits the stapler is a ploy: it's still just a dumb drawing of a stapler. This book is the stapler; I didn't fall for it."
1,A Heartbreaking Work of Stagging Self Indulgant Crap,"After hearing so much priase for this book I eagerly looked forward to reading it. Boy was I wrong. There's a fine line between fresh writing and just poor writing that appears fresh, and I fear that this book falls into the latter category. The author is evidently full of a lot of hurt and is trying to exorcise some of it through his writing. The net effect is the whole book is one long whine of how the world 'owes him' just because he has suffered loss. The introduction and the ""Mistakes We Knew We were Making"" are jokey and try to sound ""aren't we cool?"" and instead just serve to be boring. There are elements of interesting story here that are just not developed - the story of the Might magazine arc is good, and should have been fleshed out more. I really wished that there was more to this book, but it's all someone trying to be the voice of a generation while having very little to say."
1,A Staggering work of Headaches,"I know people believe that this is the greatest piece of literature since Dickens. However, I venture to disagree with all those who believe that this work shows any promise of anything other than the need for extensive therapy and maybe a vacation. I agree that Dave Eggars has had a hard life but go into Middle America and you can hear hundreds of these stories. Yet, these people have survived without mass media or capitalizing on their parents' death like Dave Eggars has. Part of me wants to actually read a work of fiction by the author just to see if this is would show the promise that many believe he has displayed. Overall, this book reads like a teenagers diary and is not worth your time."
3,"The Genius Staggers, Then Falls","This is a truly heartbreaking work, despite its self-conscious unself-consciousness. Eggers is a truly gifted storyteller, and he does try (and often suceeds) to make his heartbreak both real and funny and sad. Unfortunately, he is just a little too pleased with himself and comes across as being rather immature and smug. The genuine pathos of his story is captivating, and his honesty about what he and his family ""deserve"" for their suffering is spot on. The last half of the book falls flat, he loses his narrative and gets a lot too Zen about beach frisbee and the like, losing focus and clarity. This is a courageous book, however, and it nearly works on all the levels Eggers is trying to plumb. But its true hero is Toph. I want to read his book. That would be staggering."
1,Had to force myself to finish it...,"A writer friend of mine once told me that award winning books usually do one of two things: They make you feel far smarter than the average literary reader, or they make you feel far dumber. While I don't know if I agree with him entirely on that, I would say that his theory perfectly sums up this book. I found it so boring, self-important and monotonous that I could barely finish it. I put it down several times, having to force myself to pick it up again. I finally finished it (with relief) and was left with a feeling of ""so what?"". Considering that this book is so widely acclaimed, I was left with the feeling that either I was missing something or the critics were."
1,"Only Genius In Heartbreaking Work...Is ""Marketing Genius""","I so hated this book and I was so disappointed that I hated this book. Although I admire Eggers dedication to his brother, his account of the years following his parents' deaths read like one aggregiously long sophomoric essay on what I did on my summer vacation, year 1, year 2 year 3 etc. Although it started out rather promising, and there were snippets of humorous antecdotes, and insights, they were few and far between. Definately too sparce a crop to keep the book moving for nearly 400 pages. Maybe the male, under 20 crowd might enjoy it. I have donated my copy to my library, hopefully it will save someone some shipping and handling. Overall, bad hardback purchase, but you gotta admire his ""marketing genius""."
2,Hmmm...,"The book was in mint condition, the story was interesting but the ending was not what I was expecting and it left me feeling like the story was a waste of time."
4,Entirely enjoyable,"What a great discovering--this engaging, engrossing book is both deeply moving and funny. Laugh out loud funny. A truly original voice and I am looking forward to more of Eggers work. I did not give it 5 stars because, it lost some momemtum towards the end and smacked of twnety something self-indulgence. But that aside, it is the best book I have read in a long time. I wonder if I would like Mr. Eggers, if I met him in person. I know I would like his brother Toph."
5,An Ideal Genuine Man,"In an era where doing for 'me,me,me' has beome the golden rule, Dave Eggers has shown us strength in adversity. Dave Eggers has learned that to be a man you must act like one. Wearing the outward appearance of the hip gen xer, Dave Eggers does battle against the outsiders who would make him pitiful. He cares for his brother and fears for him. Dave Eggers is kind, generous, and loving. He's also selfish, rude, and paranoid. In other words, Dave Eggers is human. This gifted writer bares his soul and mind to us. I love Dave Eggers and I thank him for showing how to overcome heartbreaking adversity by being a real, genuine, and courageous person."
3,2 out of 3 isn't bad,"Heartbeaking? Yes. Staggering? Yes. Genius? No. Dave Eggers has created a sprawling work where he excorsises his pain over his parents' death. The interview with the Real World producers was the best part of the book. The rest seemed like a graduate-level creative writing excercise. Not as great a book as the critics say, but a readable one."
1,"i woulda give ""no"" stars, mon","dis book vex me much-much! in da words of de immortal johnnyrotten: ""ever felt like you been cheated! "" oh man, dat be me! dis book fly out da window from my hands--dis book de zenith of solipcistic charletanism, mon. dis book stinky-stinky--much-much! mon, dis guy want be david foster wallace (not a good ambition, mon, david foster wallace way pretentious too), but he no dwf! one giant yawn for dis doorstop of book. i see dis author somewhere, i give him ""what for"" dat's what i do! don't believe dah hype!"
5,"maybe not staggering, but I would say genius","I thought this was a great book, the honesty of the writing, the post modern approach to the beginning notes and end notes. Just when you think everything has been invented and there is nothing new under the sun, something like this comes and blows a clean breeze through your mind. Maybe it is for some, overly clever, but I loved stepping outside the regular process of reading fiction and exploring the roles of reader, writer, truth, plot, characters with Dave. Beyond all the ""gimmicks"" there is a solid, mostly true heartwrenching story about real people. Dave does a great job at creating an emotional honesty and truth in the characters. Editing the truth, or more accurately, not editing the truth is a tough job in a memoir and I think he succeeds admirably. Maybe I am just a little over-fascinated with the twenty-something urbanite as I also am quite enamoured of Doug Coupland and Nick Hornby and the like, but HWSG was my favorite book of 2002"
3,Burden in my bag,"First off, Eggers is a talented writer. He's also a writer with emotional baggage...a lot of it. While his reflections are at times endearing, they tend to get mundane (and downright depressing) in the latter half of the novel. Early recounts of brother Toph and general maladjustment are an interesting read. Then Eggers goes on tangents relating to crazy ""20-something"" antics while relaying his hyper paranoia in a rather annoying, self-centered way. Seeing as this is a true-to-life memoir, it's not the kind of information you can brush off as ""just made up."" You're reading about HIS mother's death, HIS dirtier-than-hell apartment, HIS inner-most fantasies and HIS flippant sex life. After a while, I began to think that, when I carried this book with me to work, I was transporting a mini Eggers in my bag. Friendly little chap at first, then a brick. A burden that I wanted to get rid of so badly, but couldn't help but devour in its whole first."
1,Snoresville,"I started out enjoying this book immensely, laughing, and rooting for the whole Eggers Family. I loved Eggers descriptions of his relationship with his brother Toph, there could have been alot more about thier interactions. Unfortunatly the book didn't end where it should have, before the Real World interview.I lost interest during the Real World fake interview (how many pages did that go on and on and on?)It was a struggle to continue on from there. I have this annoying habit of always finishing a book no matter how painful, and this book was just that, painful..."
2,Overrated ....,"Well ... for all of the hoopla surrounding the greatness of this book, I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, I found the author and his story a little too stream of consciousness for me. At times, I even thought it was self-serving to talk about his problems in the way he chose to write it. I admire him for the path he traveled but I don't think his book does it justice."
2,David Sedaris wannabe?,"Oh my, Dave Eggers rambles on and on without a point. What is interesting about David Sedaris is that he rambles but ties everything in at the end. Eggers doesn't do this. Tried very hard to like it, but just couldn't. What I did enjoy was the relationship of the lead character with his brother. Very sweet and endearing. But this was not sufficient to make me like the book."
3,Okay but hardly great,"It's amazing how many negative and one-star reviews this book spawned. I myself was tempted to say the title of this book should have been ""A Staggering Work of Heartbreaking Mediocrity,"" but actually the book is okay; it's just that it doesn't live up to its very pretentious title. There are some funny and clever things in the book, too, but the title itself might be the cleverest part. Anyway, if you can pick it up used it's worth checking out in case you're one of the people who find it truly worthwhile reading, as some people here apparently did."
3,Preface and Notes better than the book!,"Truly, I remember being bowled over by someone with the audacity to name a book A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. How could it not be hysterical? As I was swept away in the preface, I couldn't wait for the book to begin. As I finished the preface, however, I really needed to encourage myself to keep reading. The main text of the novel was quite a bit slower and drier and less engaging than I had thought, particularly after reading the breathless pace kept in Eggers' short story in Speaking With the Angel, but through it I eventually got. More than anything, that was unremarkable. I found myself somewhat disappointed, but bgan reading the notes at the end of the book anyway. And it picked right back up. So, all in all, the ""bookends"" were more interesting than the book they supported. Almost enough so that I recommend this book only for them!"
2,"I wanted to like it, but...","Incredibly overrated. This is the ""type"" of book I normally love. It kept coming up in my recommendations, so I finally broke down and bought it. Eggars is trying way too hard, and he desperately needed a better editor. There are some beautifully-turned phrases alongside some incredibly trite, freshman English class ones.The best part about the paperback is the acknowledgements. It's all slowly downhill from there."
3,good and then Uneven,"As Mr. Eggers himself says, this book gets uneven after one hundred pages. His satirical style is mixed with attempts to be serious and it just doesn't work quite right. However, his magazine seemed to be something done right. The story about Adam Rich's fake death was absolutely hiliarious....However, in summing up this book, I ask myself one question, ""If my parents died and I had to raise a brother who was a generation (almost) younger than me, how successful could I be? ""...."
2,Assistance Requested,"I just bought and downloaded this game, and it is asking me for a 16-digit multiplayer ID ""located inside your game copy."" I don't have it, of course, and I can't play without it. What do I do?"
4,hope its more like the one for xbox 360,"I seriosly hope that this game will be more like GRAW2 for the xbox 360. if its more like the PC version of GRAW1 im gonna shoot myself. UBI is being stupid teaming up with those bunch of wanna be gamemakers GRIN. they totally screwed up the first game for the pc and i hope they wont screw this one up. But lets face it.. if ubisoft/grin does what it did to the first game, we can just say Ubisoft onley cares for the ppl with Xbox 360s and not the pc gamers anymore. messege to ubi: IF THE 360 VERSION WAS A SUCESS WHY NOT MAKE THE PC VERSION LIKE IT, i'd be glad to wait longer for that and not the PC version that comming out soon. GRAW2 better be good for the PC or Ubi Wont get another PENNY from me."
3,not as good as the older one's,"Ghost Recon 2 isn't as good as the older one's, once you die that's it new game. You don't become one of the other member's. You can't change men like the older Ghost Recon game's. So have your men go 1st. But still a good game."
1,Not compatible with joysticks,"How unfortunate I will never be able to play a game I purchased because it is not compatible with joysticks. I have tried to play with a keyboard and it is next to impossible for me. However, if I am lucky someone can contact me and let me know if they have this game on PC an if there are any controllers that work with it. Otherwise, I have no idea if the game is good. What would be nice is if Amazon had a games list that ARE NOT compatible with joysticks so one could ignore that game if they choose."
3,"Better than GRAW 1, but still not better than the original.",Pros:Large open battlefields in both single and multiplayerDecent selection of weapons and gearAbility to customize a weaponDecent graphicsOGR musicMP Cooperative modeCons:The single player campaign maps are quite linearThe cut scenes and in game voice over are absolutely horribleThe game is very buggy even patched to 1.5 - many crashes on a stable systemOne shot kill super sniper AIOnly 4 stock MP Cooperative mode mapsGet this game if you are a die hard GR fan and just have to have it in your collection. Otherwise it is a decent shooter at best.
3,Good Singleplayer Action - Lousy Multiplayer,"If you're buying this game for multiplayer, don't waste your time or money. The MP community is really small, and if you're the run & gunner type, this game is mostly about tactics and camping. The maps are too big and have similar themes and get quickly get boring. If you're into the Singleplayer campaign, the game has some enjoyable moments and is overall well done, but this game is not worth paying more than $20 for."
4,Handbook on German Military Forces,"If you're looking for the nuts and bolts of what made the WW2 German army, this is the book. A very nice overview of the entire military machine. As a historian and WW2 German reenactor I liked the coverage of military tactics from army to platoon, as well as the coverage from tanks and airplanes to individual field gear. Weapons, boots, bread bags, radios and all the field gear are covered along with lesser known machines like field kitchens and bread makers! Highly recommended."
4,"An interesting perspective and a nice break from ""how-to's""","After reading so many books on how-to adopt, ""Somebody's Child: Stories from the Private Files of an Adoption Attorney"" offers a personal look into some people's experiences. Mostly told in the person's own words, the reader is given insight into the feelings, circumstances and thought-processes that go along with adoption. These stories are told from the point of view of someone involved with that particular adoption, such as the adopting parent or parents, birthmother, birthgrandmother, etc. At the end of each story the author gives a short update on the people, and then offers some insight to that particular situation (gay adoption, single parent, Indian Tribal complications.) My biggest complaint is that there are not enough stories. I'd love to see ""part 2"" that explores even more situations."
4,Very Useful Over all,The book covers a large array of the Windows API with good examples. To an experienced Delphi programmer this gives an easy reference into the Windows API with good type conversion information from C/C++ to Delphi types.Over all a very good reference book to have on the shelf. We used it the next day after it arrived.
2,Good product,"I bought this product approximately two months ago. It's been a great necklace, I have received many compliments. A decent piece of jewelry. A silver cleaner fixed the nasty discoloration I had all over it. Good as new.I'd say 5 stars, but since it won't let me edit the stars, I can only tell you this should be a 5 star review.This is a decent and good looking piece of jewelry."
3,UV blocking...,This stuff is okay... if you like to work... and it needed to be renewed after a while... and again... and again.Since the purpose of this stuff is to block UV... here is what I do. When the Herc is applied and still fresh... in the first 24 hours or so... I spray paint it with a XYLENE BASED PAINT... such as Rust Cap HAMMERITE... or even Rustoleum gloss black will work well.This fuses to the still curing Herc... and it BLOCKS UV... and gives you a CHEAP touch-up-able surface!!!
4,"Works, but be careful!","advanced max contraction training works. I've been doing high intensity bodybuilding for over four years and this protocol for isolation single joint movements is a great stimulas. However I hurt by back doing calf heel raises on a machine with too much weight on my shoulders. Also it doesn't work well with compound movements like squats, after three weeks I went back to full range squats and was sore as hell the next four days from getting the full range stretch in all my lower body muscles. Alternate this protocol with Mr. Little's other book, Body by Sceince, full range compound and you have the perfect bodybuilding schedule. I also advise people to take creatine monohydrate, the only supplement that works. And no, I have no financial interest in these products. Also, use Nautilus equipment if available."
2,"""oh well""","This is a video about Dale,Artie,Jerry n'tired ol Carmen...and so of course the Beautiful, Amazing Playboy Models get short shift! Sadly this is the real world and Playboy has to make money. That said you get to see the Outstanding,Wonderful,and Heavenly Dahm Triplets for what seems like SECONDS...ok about 10 quick minutes. The other models featured are just as amazing but their portion is also too short! The worst feature is the ""music video"" NOT! There is NO ""Music Video"", just more interviews with the models, what the????! Oh Well, you were warned!"
5,Great Christmas movie,"This has been a standard in our household for years now. Couldn't pass through a Christmas season without it!! Love the storyline, the songs, everything about this one!!!!"
5,A Christmas Classic,"Wow, this movie is one of all my favorites classics that I love. I know that the story is corny, the seats look like paper mache, but I am 50 years old and I still love this move, can sing all the songs and almost quote the movie word for word. The cast is unknown except of Rosanno Brazzi. But if you have never seen this movie, please get it. ..."
4,Aechos 604 Case with magnetic snap,Bought this case among other accesories for archos 604 but was told that its magnetic snap would adversely affect the archos - not sure how true this is -- the case is sturdy and has a perfect fit for the archos 604.
1,Too expensive,I paid 15.00 on e-bay for a antenna which does the same thing. Save your money. My antenna is just as good and accurate as this.
5,Couldn't Put It Down!!,"In Chalking It Up, Stephanie Bavaro paints a vivid picture of ""Marketing Girls Gone Wild!"" It will either remind you of you and your cube mates or make you insanely jealous that you haven't gotten away with Heather's antics!!For anyone who has had the boss from Hell or found 101 ways to look busy at work, this is a must read! Ride along with Heather as she navigates corporate America, Mommyhood and finally finds herself and inner peace."
1,move on,"This is not a reference text, rather an idiosyncratic outline of one clinician's practice. As that it is fine. But recommendations are not really state-of-the-art and there are numerous subjects inadequately covered. My criticism might be too harsh for something labelled ""Fundamentals,"" but the introduction and table of contents imply a depth this book does not have."
5,"A great ""good time"" party CD!!!","This is a real fun cd full of VERY EARLY r&b;/jump blues, which at the time didn't have a ""style name"" other then good time music.These are blues, with Big Bill's strong and appealing voice, and his shuffle guitar style, backed with usually washboard, and a few horns and a tight rhythm section. These recording from the mid to late 30's arre essential early pioneering blues, that would later influence r&b; and rock'n'roll. Essential music, to play wheneber good times are in mind..."
5,Excellent Transformer,"This is a great transformer, for running a single track layout. Works great with M.T.H and Lionel train sets. The circuit breaker does it's job if the train short circuits."
4,Better Than Vol 1,"If you've seen volume 1 [1966-75] you'll know it's not that strong, but this, strangely, is a much better film. It has a lot more footage than the first programme, and while it covers the rather disappointing 1980s albums [although, it doesn't - wisely - even mention landing on water],the whole feel of the dvd is much better. It's particularly good on the Freedom - Ragged Glory - Mirror Ball - Unplugged - Harvest Moon era, and some nice creative editing makes for an enjoyable DVD this time 'round."
3,Average,"Good in places, overlooked some of his best stuff i think, 80min is not enough time to coversuch an amazing and diverse career."
5,"dude, get dis cd","yo, names Tav, what u thinkn. if u didnt git dis cd yet, get it now!!!!!!!!1 itl b worth ur wile. SEEEEERRRIIIOOUUUSSSLYYYY, ya dont want Cartman at ur door goin, ""Hey"" in his little fat voice. Best song #'s r #1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,20,21 DDDDDDDUUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEE"

2,Candle lighting book,"I bought a different copy of this book back in the ninties in Atlanta, GA. I loved it so much that it started falling apart, so I ordered this update. I didn't like it. It wasn't as user friendly. It was confusing. I still refer to the old one."
4,"Wide shoe, very tall heel",This shoe is great looking and comfortable for people with wide feet. The heel is tall so that I really had to walk on the balls of my feet most of the night. Overall I definately like the shoes.
1,"Lots of music, few nature sounds","Way too much music and the music was too loud. Not only that, but the music isn't even good - just some new-agey soothing sounds stuff... I bought it to meditate while I listen to nature but ended up giving it away after one listen..."
4,great travel guide,will use this alot on our next trip to Chicago. Wish print was a little bit bigger tho.
5,Totally pleased!,"Could not be happier with this light weight, easy to handle hose. Terrific water pressure despite its size, and rolls up into a small bundle making it very easy to hide behind a plant until I need to use it. What a great idea!"
5,... recived it just in time....,i really needed this book for class i got it early and am willing to shop for more books on amizon!! yay
1,I was in realy bad condition,"I don't understand how anyone would consider this book in acceptable condition! It's in bad condition and not worth selling. Even though I didn't pay a whole lot, it wasn't worth it! It's not even worth sending back. It would cost me more to send back than what I paid for! The seller should reconsider what is acceptable! Bad choices there!!"
1,The worst experience ever with AMAZON,I have been deeling with Amazon for well over 10 years. My last experience withA1 Books was the worst I have ever had. I am a symphony conductor and desparatelyneeded a score. Rather than taking the usual week to 10 days delivery thisarrived 21 days later. Don't buy anything from them!
1,Not produced well,"The cd had a nice cover, but the contents of it were poorly made. One can hear how ""sampled"" the wind and evening crickets were when they cut in and out sharply beginning and ending throughout the recording. The majority of the recording was music, which at times didn't complement the bits and pieces of wolf howls. Annoying sounds of chimes and a bit of the harp really clashed with the howling. And the calling of the wolves was electronically altered to echoe, and resound. It was often too much echoing. But the few times on the cd in which one hears the wolves isn't enough to even relate the contents of the cd with ""sounds of the wolves"". I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone who is looking to hear wolves rather than music."
4,A Page-Turner,"While the story is a straightforward mystery, the book is intriguing because of the characters. Alex and Clinton are believable, fallible young men who are at times sympathetic and at other times difficult or even detestable. They both love their sisters, their mothers, their fathers. These commonalities make their conflict all the more uneasy. Along with the HIV information, themes of alcoholism, abandonment, and what makes life livable weave in and out of the story. This strikes me as the sort of book that might appeal equally to male and female audiences."
4,The Book Which Transcends Its Author,"""Father Joe"" is best described as a book about a saint written by a sinner. Tony Hendra may have done more awful things than what he admits in his memoir, ""Father Joe"", but that doesn't negate his ability to recognize the good in Fr. Joe. Likewise it says as much about Fr. Joe as it does about Hendra when by the end of the book it becomes clear that Hendra failed to realize the scope of Fr. Joe's love of others. As flawed as its author may be, he has written a beautiful book about love and his own lack of love."
2,I was Disappointed,"I purchased this book anticipating spiritual inspiration. To the contary I felt that this was naive, tedious & shallow. The hype for this book on the ""Imus in the Morning"" radio program was thoroughly deceptive."
2,Thumbs Down,"I found this book difficult to finish because the protagonist, Tony Hendra (not Father Joe), is not a likeable character. Tony Hendra's ""tribute"" to Father Joe is actually a memoir of his own rather selfish life, which unfortunately included using Father Joe's name to sell his book. If you looking for sage advice from Father Joe, you will find little of it in this book."
3,overhyped,"I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews rendered by The NY TImes and other publications. When the narrative directly involves Father Joe, it is engaging and insightful. But a great deal of time is spent detailing the relatively uninteresting early adulthood foibles of the author. Admittedly, his writing is eloquent and he includes some eye-opening accounts (among others, Jerry Lewis does not fare too well!), but I would guess that I am not alone in being uninterested in his agonizingly indepth exploration of National Lampoon Magazine and a British television show populated with puppets.I would have preferred a more concise portrait of Father Joe and a less detailed recitation on the life of Tony Hendra. In this book, called 'Father Joe', the title character makes far too little of an appearance."
1,Little of the spirit here,"This book contains little about Father Joe and even less about spirituality. It never explains how Hendra's soul was saved -- if, indeed, it ever was. Hendra himself seems still very much a ""scoffer and worldling"" (in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape's words) at the end of the story. Thus Hendra unintentionally offers a warning about his own incurable worldliness. For spiritual sustenance, do look elsewhere."
5,After a month of use....,"I have to affirm how wonderful this laptop is... It may not be the right choice for someone who wants impressive 3D gaming, or a large screen with large font, but I have had not complaints at all. But then again, I like the small screen, the high resolution, the high contrast, the small keyboard (which some people think is too mushy, but I like b/c there is not much travel). This thing travels well, I don't need to bring the AC adapter along when I have been getting a solid 4 hr battery life. The speed is quite good. I have not upgraded to 1 GB of RAM yet, but so far I have been able to process MRI images and 3D reconstructions without a problem."
3,"Good small laptop, but too expansive!!!","The Fujitsu has a simular product, and it is about $300~$500 less than this SONY TR1AP (of course not as stylish). I really like SONY TR1AP's small and stylish design, but this laptop is way too expansive for it's feature.I think I will wait for a little while for the price to drop then I will change it to a 5 stars."
4,Beautiful!,"I saw the movie, which was excellent, and wanted the soundtrack. The music is beautiful, and it's so nice to hear the complete versions of songs that you only heard bits of in the movie. It's an excellent recording, crisp and clean. But the volume levels change so much that it's hard to listen to. Keep your stereo at a moderate volume for the loud parts, and you literally can't hear the quiet parts. Turn your stereo up for the quiet parts, and the loud parts rupture your eardrums. But if you like playing music really loud, it won't be a problem."
1,If you are looking for THE song...,"I purchased the 'Flower Duet' CD mentioned below on the advice of the person who recommended it and no, it isn't close to the version used in the trailer. Still looking...sigh..."
3,Picture is Deceiving,"The picture for this item shows three knives, when really you are just purchasing one knife. I bought this item and thought I was going to receive three knives, when it came there was only one knife the skinnier of the three. Just want everyone to know what they are ordering."
1,1001 Sudoku,Each page contains 2 puzzles - No ProblemEach puzzle is small and surrounded by a huge border.Very Poor Format
1,Spoiled by the Joker,"This otherwise acceptable recording is ruined by Dom DeLuise who, in the role of the Wazir, is a joke. The part may be musically undemanding, as noted in the Amazon editorial review, but it does require singing, which DeLuise's weak voice cannot provide. The London Symphony, under Gemignani's direction, is quite good.I would recommend the original cast recording with Alfred Drake."
3,"Unusable to Turn Off Brain, But...","I buy this stuff to turn off my brain, and the birdcalls on this CD are agony. I can't take it. They also cross-fade between a few different streams, which is a very unnatural procedure to listen to. However, of all the nature CDs I bought, I use this one, in so far as that I located a 60-second stretch of the particularly nice, burbling brook and dropped it on a CD-R 75 times, with fade in and out at the ends of the CD, and I play that on repeat. I also knock out the top 3 octaves."
3,Sound was not as I expected,The CD doesn't have a good sound. I guess that is becausethe price was low.
1,Garbage,"I don't trust anything by this brand. I bought a non-stick steel set. After about a month, the teflon started bubbling and peeling. Scratches started rusting. We only use plastic and wood to stir and serve."
1,Thin and poorly constructed,"This is the worst cookware I've ever seen. One of the handles broke as soon as I got it out of the box. After only a few uses, the Teflon started come off the large pots. The shells are so thin that the fry pan actually became convex on the first use."
2,Not a Bad deal,"Hi,Not a bad deal, but, the handle are not of good quality. The handles are developing cracks within a weeks use. And cutlery set are also poor quality. Maybe it is worth the price, but overall not a deal"
3,"Decent, but not too good to be true.","I have two complaints: The handles are so heavy that they weigh down one side of the pan a little if you don't have something heavy in the pan. Also, the bonus cooking utensils are pretty, but they are a bit flimsy. They bend too easily.Otherwise, I have been happy with this set."
5,The Boston Pops does it again!,"If you like the sounds of American music at its best then this is the C.D.to own in your collection. The Boston Pops has 16 of the best march tunes around on the c.d. From 76 Trombones to the Liberty Bell March to The Stars and Strips Forever, this is a highly recommended C.D.! Enjoy!"
5,Ocean Relaxing Surf review,"Good listening cd, one of my favorites. I would recommend to a friend. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3"
5,Universalist Classic,"John Wesley Hanson (1823-1901) was a prolific writerabout Christian Universalism and, for me, the greatesttheologian of Universal Restoration since Origen.Universalism, The Prevailing Doctrine of the ChurchDuring Its First 500 Years (pub. 1899) is the crownjewel of all Hanson's works. In my opinion, this bookshould be next to every Bible in the world! In hisIntroduction, Hanson notes that others have written onthis topic, most notably Hosea Ballou II who wroteAncient History of Universalism (1828, 1842, 1872) andEdward Beecher who wrote History of the Doctrine ofFuture Retribution (1878). Hanson states that both ofthese books are excellent but incomplete and that thepurpose of his writing is to include additionalmaterial from the writings of the early Church fatherson Universal Salvation.J. W. Hanson's Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrineof the Christian Church During Its First Five HundredYears is a timeless classic and a must read for eveyUniversalist."
4,Very depandable...,"One con on this product is, it keeps coming down even after I twisted it tight. Over all, it does the job as I fly my American flag with either my Chicago Bears or Cubs flag."
2,Not as expected,"I wasnt impressed. The item came as expected, but as one of the other reviews stated, there was no instructions that came with the product. I followed one of the reviews for seasoning the wok, but it didnt season it very well. Now I have a huge black ring around the bottom of the wok."
1,The Blessed light,"Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book. No, don't even read it. I made the mistake of thinking the authors were Christians (as we define them by being followers of Christ, acknowledge God as the one TRUE God) but they are not. I quickly realized they were using the Bible as a way to justify universalism. Sorry. You can't take some of the Bible and throw out the rest. God grace is available to all, but not all will accept it. And there is only ONE way to the Father. No, God won't send any to Hell, but if we do not choose to accept Him, we send ourselves there.~E"
3,"OK, but not great at actual proof","""If Grace Is True"" is mostly anecdotal and emotional, and that is where it is weak. They should have explained more about the Greek word ""Aion"" and the REAL meanings of the words ""Sheol"", ""Gehenna"", ""Tartarus"", and ""Hades"". A far better source of biblical proof for Universal Salvation is L. Ray Smith's website, www.bible-truths.com."
2,Music to throw an orgy by...?,"If you're planning an orgy as part of your social calendar this summer, this is the CD for you! As a brave attempt to reproduce the music of Rome, it deserves substantial praise. However, if it is an accurate imitation, I pity the ancient Romans. The music of Synaulia's Disk 1 is rarely melodic and seems more post-modern than ancient. I wonder whether the repetitiveness of the songs is an unavoidable result of the limited tonality of the replicated instruments or of the composer's failure to achieve proficiency with them before starting. The songs are often accompanied by maenadic shrieking, music most apropos for a fraternity toga party. Evoe, guys!"
4,GREAT STUFF,"This CD is ample evidence of Midori's virtuosity, coupled with first-rate musicality. However, I have to disagree with one reviewer's assertion that she is non-pareil. Indeed, her Ernst is not perfect, though it comes very close. Careful listening will pick up slight intonation errors.Ricci performed with more facility. It is utterly ridiculous to place her above Heifetz, or even Perlman. And it is even more ridiculous to suggest that those two violinists were afraid to record the Ernst. Midori is great, but not as great as Heifetz or Perlman or Ricci."
5,Applause! Bravo!,"For a whole generation of music affectionados, this album has what you want--electronic and jazz beats combined with opera favorites with the best of taste. Play this while entertaining at your next party, or while sitting out by a pool, or just when driving for an hour and watch how it captivates the listerner, opening up his or her emotions and involving one. Your conversations will defintely get interesting with another person. I look forward to much more of this and what an opportunity for new musicians and composers to sort of package what we used to say was ""Sophie Tucker in Debbie Reynold's wrap."" This sort of music will help make opera accessible to many people."
4,fun book to thumb through,See the Images I uploaded so you can see the back cover and some of the designs. I agree with the other reviewer that this is a cool book. I think it's a little off-putting that the cover project is a tennis racket and the green background color is not very appealing. But there are a number of designs here that are celtic knot-like and would be nice to translate into painting or cross stitch. My husband teaches computer aided drawing (CAD) and he says the designs are pretty well drafted.
5,Refunded money when not asked for,"The book I thought I was ordering from the picture was actually a different book than the one I had wanted and thought I was ordering. Because the total cost was only $5.03, I had decided not to try and return the book. I was amazed today when I received a full refund from Goodwill Industries of Florida. I am very impressed with their efforts to make things ""right"" with me. Thank you, Goodwill! Very commendable!"
1,"Oh, this REALLY sucks ...",I usually read the reviews before I buy anything but I didn't in this case. :-( I had the same problem as Galina. I bought this guitar for my daughter's birthday and the strings were broken the very next day. You can't tune/tighten the strings without them breaking. [...]
3,A lost boy.,It is a good story of a son of a pioneer family captured by Indians and then sold to other tribes.after 34yrs he went o n a search for his family. A good factual story .'t f2f family
3,Ok cover,The case is a great idea but one problem I have found on a daily basis is the need to continually snap and push the cover back on to the phone. There is nothing to keep it secure and in place.
1,i hate this case,i have almost an identical case for my galaxy s2 by ballistic which i love so i purchased this one for my galaxy note it is a very ill fitting case. what irritates me the most is the right corner of the shell keeps coming out of position and presses the power buttun and shuts off my phone or if i take out of my pocket the shell comes off. i do not want my phone exposed. so in closing i will not buy this brand ever again i will order the ballistic version of this case
2,Rust!,"I bought a large Phillippe Richard cookware set (4 skillets and 4 pots, 5 lids, baking rack and pan and utensils) and within a year it has developed rust from the ""non-stick"" surface wearing off. I only put the lids in the dishwasher, and I've had no problem with them. I don't scour these pots and pans or use very rough cleaning pads, but the Teflon-wannabe coating on the pieces themselves certainly explains the great deal I got on this set at JCPenney Home Store. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a nicer brand. You'll end up buying new ones before too long anyway when this one rusts."
4,Not with Vista,"This is a good book for learning ArcGIS. Just don't expect to run the provided software, ArcVIEW 9.1, on Windows Vista. Some features work fine, others crash the program."
3,Labs for GIS,"This book illustrates GIS functions very well. It is maybe a little too detailed, and most users could probably read through it faster without as much text and explanation of every step. It does a good job of graphically showing procedures and steps in ArcGIS."
5,Great way to buy,Book was in condition as described. It is one of my favorites and I was unable to find it in stores or from the original sellers. It is nice to be able to find these things when there seems to be no other way to obtain them. Thanks.
2,Don't bother,"While the information contained within the pages of this book are pretty interesting, it's not something you'd look for, in terms of finding out further information on this holiday, and it's history.Seemingly random quotes are thrown in, and the book simply does not hold your attention.The cover gives the impression that it may be suitable to read with your child. The font size, and the size of the book are the only things that would deem it so.Save your money, and buy something else."
5,Jean's review,"Not only is this the MOST beautiful and intriguing book I've ever given to my children, the story of how it came to be is an important reminder to hang onto our dreams. It's perfect for anyone of any age. I gave it to my boss last year (someone who ""has everything"") and she loves it."
5,Everyone who loves Christmas should have this book!,"When my mother gave us ""The Christmas Alphabet,"" she said she knew we'd love it, and she was right. So do all the guests who visit us during the holidays! In fact, we now play a game with the book whenever new people see it. We tell them to try and guess what picture will pop up to correspond to each letter. Correct guesses bring squeals of delight, but even wrong guesses lead to admiration for the design that springs out. Of course, the letter ""z"" always leads to great puzzlement! This book will always be a treasure in our house as well as a favorite gift to give to others!"
4,If You Already Own Va Va Voom ....,"Despite being a big Cinerama fan, and loving everything they've done, I was hesitant to purchase ""This is Cinerama."" I already owned the U.S. release of ""Va Va Voom,"" and there appeared to be quite a bit of overlap (around 6 songs) between the two CD's.As it turned out, there's plenty of original, superb, material on ""This is Cinerama,"" making it absolutely worth the separate purchase. The CD even contains an interesting cover of the Smith's ""London.""By the way, the converse hold's true. If you already own ""This is Cinerama,"" and have been hesitant to purchase ""Va Va Voom,"" well .... again, plenty of great stuff on ""Va Va Voom,"" making it worth the separate purchase.The only thing that I don't love about the CD--yet--is a couple of the re-mixes of Cinerama songs. However, they do seem to be slowly growing on me."
5,14 inch carbon steel wok,I really like this wok. I've had one like this before. This is even better than the one I had.
5,You NEED this wok!,"You might not want to do as much research as I did to find a wok, but I was determined to find a high-quality, authentic wok that would provide years of service. And my research paid off! This wok is made of hand hammered carbon steel, so it will stand up to the high heat required to perfectly stir fry your favorite ingredients! Not only that, but your ingredients will stay in place when you need to move them higher up the sides. I am very happy with the results of the seasoning process. The Wok Shop e-mailed me easy-to-follow-instructions for this necessary task. Cooking with this wok is fantastic! I've already used it three times, and I have had excellent results every time. It is large enough to cook enough ingredients for a family of three. But if you have a larger family, I would highly recommend the 16"" wok. Either way, you will be very happy with this product."
1,awful,My daughter wanted a green guitar for Christmas. Asked Santa last minute. I found this one and ordered it. The strings are loose and can't be tightened. Two pulled loose the first time she touched it. It is NOT worth $5 never mind what they are asking!!
2,Problems with it,"I bought this as a gift for my son, while he loves the Insanity series we had problems with this. There was a dvd missing and a duplicate of another dvd. With Amazon's policy we had to return it and then but it again. If I had bought it from Beach Body they would have just fixed the problem. I ended up returning to Amazon and buying it from Beach Body through the Insanity site, they guarantee your purchase. My advice, go directly to Insanity's site to buy it."
1,"Define Humanities, Please...","Although this book provides a fair amount of information, the definition of ""Humanities"" is sorely lacking. Among the majors you will NOT find in this book are: speech, theater, dance, communications. For a book that claims to cover the humanities, these oversights are substantial, and it means I wasted my money getting a book that provides me with no help whatsoever. Caveat Emptor...."
2,What A Disappointment,"The first two songs on this CD (""Visit Me"" and ""That Other Woman"") are pretty good and sound like the Changing Faces that we have come to know and love. And the 8th song on the CD (""Doin' To Me"") is OK. But the rest of the songs on this CD slide down into mediocrity. In fact, some of the songs are not even mediocre - they're just flat no good. And the electronica and 'space ship' sounds on at least one of the songs is just plain annoying. I gave this CD two stars - one for ""Visit Me"" and one for ""That Other Woman"". Save your money on this one. What a disappointment."
5,The Rustic Cabin,This is an excellent book on the topic of the adirondacks and adirondack home. Ralph Kylloe always does a fantastic job with pictures and text. It was a very worhtwhile purchase.ThanksG. Cerank
4,Tuca Ta Casta~,"This album is a good thing to have. Its only flaw is its professionalism, not that its stale, but its not Raw, very calculated. which, of course, can be a good thing and a drawback. A common problem for much of world music. For much of music in general. At the right time of day, its Very fun, full of intricate melodies and poly rythms. The use of language is very playful and sensitive. dig it or dont!"
1,Used to be a great tumbler,"I used to love these tumblers. In the past 7 years I have owned 3 of them. I still have the original (lost the other two) and the seal finally went on it so I decided to stock up on some more.To my surprise the quality had went down the drain. I ordered two of them and both of them leaked. Since I am a engineer and can't leave ""doesn't work"" alone I disassembled the lids to find that the issue was poor injection molding which lead to sink marks in the seals contact surface.Maybe the mold for this lid has met its demise and that's why these cups are no longer available, maybe I got unlucky, or maybe Trudeau's quality standards have went out the window? All I know is I would not buy another one of their ""Leak Proof"" products without seeing, in person, that it is actually ""Leak Proof""."
2,Not good quality comparing to the price,"The look of this mug is nice, but its quality is bad. It does not keep the beverage hot for long time at all. When I bought this travel mug I assumed it is good and keeps beverages hot for at least two hours, so I bought it. Also it is considered not cheap one comparing it with the other mugs.If you look for a nice mug only, this one would be a good choice. But it is not that good quality."
4,Different,It was different from usual steel covered types. It represented the breast cancer awareness theme; that made it more appealing. Hopefully more people will buy it for its color.
2,Gator should have left this one in the swamp,"This entry in the popular Prestige series pairs Willis Jackson's ""Keep On A Blowin'"" (tracks 1-6) and ""Thunderbird"" (tracks 7-12). Neither finds Jackson at the top of his game. The guitarist, Bill Jennings, while not a fret butcher like Thornel Schwartz, isn't remotely in the same league with Pat Martino.""Thunderbird"" is marred by some simple rock chord progressions. And the rest of the CD wouldn't qualify for the most humble Blue Note blowing date. With so much great hard bop material of this vintage on the market, unless you want every note Willis Jackson played, skip this one."
1,Not happy,Oh my Rating is not even that star but that was the only way to post-it is absolutely a negative star. I can not believe I just paid for less than a page of information that is less than what is available free online. What in the world? UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
4,Great quartet music,"I didn't give this one 4 stars because I think I've heard some better albums from Gold City. However, this is a great album! It definitely has songs you will be singing along with."
2,good lamp bad clamp,"I have had two of these lamps . Amazon replaced the first one when the plastic clamp and holder broke. Now the clamp on the second one broke tonight. The lamp needs a metal holder and clamp to make it secure. Otherwise the magnifier and the swing part are great.Grandrich ML-100 BLK Magnifier Light, Black"
5,Wonderful family story,"Tortilla Soup is one of those feel good movies you see again and again. The story is about a retired Chef, Hector Elizondo who has raised three daughters. The story progresses with personal development of all characters. The music and introduction of preparation of wonderful Mexican cooking is almost enough to make your mouth water! Lots of laughs!"
3,How did this get a PG-13 rating?,"VERY, VERY heavy on sexual innuendo from beginning to end,it is hard to imagine how this movie got a PG-13 rating. The movie is fun and funny, but definitely not appropriate for classroom viewing."
4,ultrasonography in obsterics and gynacology by callen,I like the book very much. As a student I have difficulties for difficult words. It is a great book for the experts but hard for the students.
3,"Not a bad little book, but not one of the series' best.","Joann Sfar, Dungeon: The Early Years, vol. 1: The Night Shirt (Nantier Ball Minoustchine, 2005)Did you know Hyacinthe used to be a crimefighter? It's true! Sfar, Trondheim, and Blain give you the skinny in The Night Shirt, volume I of Dungeon: The Early Years, which deals with the care and feeding of the young Hyacinthe, who finds himself transformed (through no fault of his own, mind you) into a masked crusader for justice after going to the big city to live with his corrupt uncle.My initial impression of the book was ""starts slow and gets better as it goes on,"" but I've come to realize that ""gets better"" was not the book, it's me-- I got used to the layout, which is often mediocre at best, with everything crammed into far too small a space.Not one of Dungeon's best volumes, but if you're a fan, you'll get a kick out of it. **"
1,Save your money!,"Very difficult to control. Tried both the keyboard and Wingman joystick. You can't use both the keyboard and other controller such as mouse or joystick at the same time. If you don't have 32 fingers for the keyboard or a joystick with 15+ buttons, you're hosed. Otherwise, the graphics look good and the game play seems like it would be fun, if only you could maneuver around."
5,An excellent balanced overview of classical Greek ethos.,"As a retired computer industry executive, I have spent seventeen serious years both formally a la carte at Oxford and elsewhere as well as informally studying classical Greek culture, have amassed a library of over four thousand books on this subject, and I only regret that I didn't have Peter France's book as my course outline before I started. The respect that Sir Kenneth Dover and other eminent scholars (and in Dover's case, formerly Oxford) lent Mr. France certainly attests with more authority than I to its value. Its thoroughness, breadth and accuracy of representation of a very complex culture is truly admirable and would have saved me from many lower priority lower yield ""roads less traveled""."
3,doesn't wash well,"Very cute backpack, however doesn't wash well. My daughter spilled milk on it so I had to wash it, and it faded very badly. Don't know if you are supposed to hand wash it or maybe mine is defective but I was very dissapointed and to make matters worse it didn't fade evenly. It is still dark from where the flap comes over so it's obvious it is faded. Very dissappointed especially for the cost."
3,Kid's backpack OK as intended,"This kids' backpack is a bit small, but well-made, and close enough to meet the description in product overview.My Kindergartener loves it, so we are happy."
4,Logical and simple to understand,The author does a great job of comparing the Quran and Bible to Scientific knowledge today. I am computer scientist. This book appealed to me because it logical and simple to understand.
4,"Great pacing, but with organ?","What a lovely performance. Harry Christophers found a lovely pace at which to perform this most beautiful mass. Unfortunately, however, the recording features instrumental accompaniment in the polyphony. While this tends to not be too noticeable, there are several key moments in the music (where individual voices are isolated) where the organ is quite prominent.This mass needs no accompaniment - the ensemble should not need filling-in by additional instruments.That said, it is far from the typical plodding recording that most labels have published and, as such, is a very worthwhile addition to any period library."
2,uncomfortable,not enough padding. hard plastic against ears. someone else said this and i should have believed. it does seem to have good sound and reseption but that doesnt do much good if you dont want to wear them because your ears will hurt.
1,Horrible Charging System,I got this product as a replacement for their previous model which had literally melted on its cradle. (It took 2 months to get a replacement.) This model worked well enough to start. Now it doesn't charge anymore. It's only been a months. Don't bother with this!!!
4,AN AMAZING CHILDREN'S BOOK,"If you like books about indians and pilgrims, this is the book for you. It is all about Squanto, an indian who meets the pilgrims and shows the pilgrims how to plant crops. When Squanto was young white men came to his village and he went to London with them. Then he wanted to go back to his village so he was took back to it with Charles Robin a friend of his. But then . . . . I guess you will just have to read it on your own."
5,"Steven Lance- raw, unbridled precision","Vulgarian Goulash has left one deep, dark imprint on my psyche. I read several of the stories while traveling through airports on my way to Chicago for a holiday, and the images that were retained haunted several of my susequent days of leisure. Pure enternainment at its most crass. The stories work on several different levels at once, creatively engrossing one in the storyline while introducing political, theoretical, ideological, phenomenological and several other lines of thought to characters from all walks of life. With his piercingly clever style of writing and dark, steamy imagination, Lance will chisel pretty deeply into the people who read it. Can't wait until the movie comes out!"
1,Obsolete Product - Can't Be Installed.,"This product is eight years old and had to be activated through GoDaddy. Attempts to activate it through the software itself were unsuccessful. I called Godaddy. GoDaddy's apps engineer hadn't heard of it, could find no mention of it in their archives, and couldn't activate it. I returned it for credit."
1,This book seems totally unedited!,"Wordware apparently never applied any editorial skills to what was obviously a poor first draft of what could have been a good book. The text is often disconnected to illustrative code, the code on the CDROM misses some chapters and is not in the correct directories. It is a roll of the dice trying to find the code you are interested in. A large number of the formats covered are of no interest, and for the money it is a puny book. Nobody should buy this book."
3,Cute But Not Very Useful,"I absolutely love the Jamie Oliver collection of Royal Worcester dinnerware.The whole collection is very subtle and very stylish (I would STRONGLY suggest you ""click"" on the item picture to get a larger view of the design on the dish).These particular dishes, however, are very small and though rather adorable, I'm not sure how functional they really are.They seem very well made and arrived in pristine condition due to excellent packing from Amazon.Royal Worcester is a well respected company and they make very durable and long lasting plates.This bowl, though small, is not dainty nor fragile - it seems very durable and able to take everyday use (if you can figure out what to do with it, how to make use of it).My rating of three stars is only due to their limited functionality. As far as quality goes - they are five star all the way."
1,"Great performer, bad DVD quality","Gorden Lightfoot is fantastic -- my whole family enjoys his songs and we have seen him in concert. This DVD, however, does a poor job. The picture quality is VHS quality and sound is so-so."
3,A little disappointing....,The audio and video quality of the DVD is excellent. I liked everything about it EXCEPT Gordon Lightfoot's voice. I will admit that I have never seem him before and have been a long time fan through his older albums only. It was news to me that his voice has changed so much. It is higher and much more nasal.I realized I was expecting to hear the voice that had sent chills up my spine and had touched my heart so many times. No disrespect intended to Mr. Lightfoot but I was disappointed.
1,Gordon Lightfoot-Live In Reno,Let Me Start By Saying I Love Gordon Lightfoot but this Dvd is awful. I can hardly hear his voice over the instruments. I am not watching it on DTS but I would expect to be able to hear his voice. It sounds as though they didn't turn his microphone on. I recommend you save your money or purchase Cd's of his music.
3,"Works great, but there are cheaper options","In my experience this bait works fine for channel cats, you can also use it to bait your crawfish traps. However, I found this bait expensive compared to a much cheaper options such as cheap hot dogs, which I found worked just as well for channel cats. In short, this bait works fine, but there are cheaper options."
4,Bobsled On Fire,"This band was one one of a handful of promising rock bands to come out of the University Of North Texas music scene in the early to mid-1990's. There sound was at once striking and forceful and then mysterious and laid back. Loveswing was very successful at tilling the ground between hippie-pop and hard rock. This is actually their 2nd album. (The first also being titled ""Loveswing"".)Songs like ""Indian Style"", ""Out of Here"" and a hidden track called ""Flamingo"" are it's strongest points, but the entire album holds its' own against anything from that time period."
5,Truly excellent.,"I recently bought this item a few weeks ago, ad after the first listen through, my impression of the album was nothing less than, ""Wow. Truly exellent. This is the Mona Lisa masterpeice of guitar music."" It manages to showcase some of Santana's early work, the latin-pop-rock-blues, as well as including the Santana band's later, more Jazz and spiritually infused music. It also includes the 16 minute masterpeice ""Incident at Neshabur"", my favorite song of all time.BUY IT, FEEL IT, DIG IT, BABY!"
1,An Insult to Thai food,"I received this book from a friend before I knew much about Thai food. After eating more thai food and actually visiting Thailand, I see that this book is an insult to Thai food. From using Ketchup to make Pad Thai (yes I know that authentic ethnic food can be difficult to make but how many corners can you cut before you still call it ethnic?) to a Crab bruschetta with mayonaise this book shows you what Thai food is not. Your time would be much better spent searching all sorts of Thai food recipe websites than using this book. On the positive side, the recipes are fairly easy and the pictures are pretty."
5,Oh YEAH!,"It's real! It's raw! It's gut-level! There is no slick production work. They didn't clean it up so it'll go down easy. It's down home cookin' - none o' this fancy white tablecloth eats. It's from the soil and you can taste the dirt! You ain't gonna like it at first, but it's gonna become part o' yo' soul an' then you gonna crave it."
4,A mostly solid date,"5 of the 6 tunes on this album are very good; only ""Sleeper"" falls to the average ranking. But although those other 5 tunes are very good, none is really exceptional; thus only 4 stars. On the other hand, Cannonball made only a handful of albums better than this one. A good album to get."
1,Unedited Is Worth 5 Stars,"Don't waste your money on an unedited copy unless your parents have a problem with swearing. Otherwise, buy the unedited!"
3,Lyrics sink this CD.,"Despite my 3 star rating, this album is definitely worth a listen or two. It contains intricate and tight guitar work with excellent melodies and hooks. The arrangements of the songs are tightly wound. The harmonies are perfectly placed and swell to nigh perfection. The lead vocals are also impressive. Michael Persh is an Eddie Vedder prototype. His vocal lines soar with true passion, and his voice is engaging and compelling.Unfortunately, the lyrics prevent this CD from being a truly great work of art. There's so much telling instead of showing, and as a result, the lyrics are difficult to engage with and are off-putting. Some of it comes across as a bit preachy and pretentious. Were the landscape of the lyrics as colorful and vivid as the music behind it, there is no doubt in my mind that people would remember this band without any difficulty."
5,The Story of a Great American,"Fred Rogers was a man of many talents: Presbyterian minister; puppetier; child psychologist; musician; television personality: he devoted his life to providing small children with a nurturing, educational, non-violent alternative to the slew of cartoons and toy commercials that saturate them.Mr. Rogers let children (and adults) know that it is wise and healthy to grow up to be a crative and gentle adult. He taught tolerance and anger management. He did a great service for children and our country. I grew up with Mr. Rogers and I watched my older children watch him. Now that he is gone, I try to talk to my little boy in a way that is partly influenced by Mr. Rogers's kind and gentle tone."
3,crafty,"I like this book for the different craft ideas they have, but it is mostly for home decore. Not for gift giving. If your looking for a book for home decorating then great book."
4,Good Laminated Map,"The Streetwise map of Seattle is a very good map if you want something that's durable and will fit in your pocket. Because it's laminated, you can write on it with overhead transparency markers. If you are looking for a detailed map of areas just outside of Seattle, this map isn't the best for that."
3,Streetwise Seattle,Covers the subject well but far from completly. Handy to carry because it is a small book. Nice color illustrations. Points of interest chosen would sit well with people in their 20's but no so well with people in their 60's
3,"Casper is good, but the movie is just","Casper Van Dien plays Eddie Barton, an ex-convict who's trying to make a new life for himself and his young son. His talent lies in rehabilitating unruly horses that have been given up on, just as many people have given up on him. Eddie finds his greatest challenge in Big Spender, a stallion with a sweet tooth and a rotten temperament. Looks and feels like TV movie, but find for Casper fans.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!!!!!,"This is basicly the worst you can get... even worse than the disco versions!!! If you enjoy listening to video game music, you may like it... It is, lets say, John Williams meets PAC-MAN!!! There are only 5 or 6 songs on each CD, the quality is terrible even for a video game, it is just a plain waste of money, time, and sound!!! Luckily I was able to get my money back, but some sellers are not so nice I am sure! I am hoping this review will keep you from making the same mistake I did!!!!This ""klingsithvamp"" must be reviewing a different set that I am. I know what I am talking about!"
1,Not worth money.,I have read a couple of other of Andy's work and they are prettymuch all the same. Simplistic character development along withthin plots. The books are usually 270 pages or so and fortunatelydo not take a long time to read through.I have come to the conclusion that this authors efforts ( at leastfor me ) are simply not worth it. I want writing on the level ofGraham McNiell or Dan Abnett or Sandy Mitchel and he just will neverbe able to supply it.
4,Works as advertised.,"We wanted this timer for our greenhouse. It is easy to use and serves the functions we needed. The two leads allow us to monitor the temperature at two levels in the greenhouse, which has been useful. Large readout is easy to see. We have not yet had high humidity in the greenhouse, so that will be another test of the unit, but so far it is working beautifully. It was a good value."
4,Great min/max thermometer for lab ovens,Inexpensive compared to other thermometers. Works well in our 2 lab ovens. It let us know when electricity went out.
4,A True Blessing,"The day I bought the album I listened to it straight through. I think it was ok, but a little bit boring. Well...I've started to listen it more, and the more I listen to it, the more I luv it! This album is jammin' and it has really started blessing me and giving me a lot to think about. My fav tracks are especially ""testify"", ""God's favor"" and the ""When the saints go to worship"", which is so magnificent it makes me cry every time I hear it. (Don't ask me why, just listen to it.) This album reminded me a little of Kirk Franklin's Nu Nation Project which is still my favourite gospel album. Still Donald Lawrence is very annointed and filled with Spirit and truly blessed, 'cause he has used his talents to give God praise and make others do the same with this music. TCS is a great group and I hope I could one day hear them sing live. If you haven't got this album yet, I got three word's for y'all: Get It Now! And God bless."
4,Good price and able to fake-out a parrot.,"This appears to be my parrot's favorite nature cd as she immediately starts to sing and begins to preen herself when I put it on. It's nice background noise for humans too, as it alternates from a brook sound to a (rather white-noise) waterfall sound."
5,Invaluable training tool,"I purchased a bag of these treats for my French Brittany pup while on vacation at Camp Gone to the Dogs. Brittany's tend to be food hounds and you need to be careful not to overfeed them. Vegas (my Brittany) just loved them, and I don't need to worry about overfeeding him because of the low calories.With the amount of training a new pup needs, these treats have been a Godsend, and he loves them."
3,An RPG play-by-play,"The book is based on a Role Playing Game (RPG) and has a lot of potential. The only problem is that it reads like a radio annoucing a play-by-play of an actual game. The plot is loose and appears to form almost spontaneously as it progresses. The characters are stereotypical and two dimensional. I'm curious if the secons book improves on the first, since there doesn't have to be as much effort on side comments and more on the story line. It was reviewed as a parody of the X-Files. I disagree. There is almost no parody, but minor plagurisms of assorted myths and popular literary genres."
5,A fun and entertaining read,"This is one terrific mystery, filled with the unexpected, vivid characters, an ironic setting - murders amongst the Boston Brahmins - intrigue, and a seasoning of romance.What I can't figure out is how I missed reading anything by Charlotte MacLeod until now! She writes with humor, skill, and a slyness that keeps the killer a mystery until the last pages.And the beauty part? The Family Vault is only the first in a series starring many of these same characters.A fun and entertaining read."
3,"Fun, very different, wonderful language","This is a very offbeat Peter Shandy adventure, but not at the usual college. A trip back in time in Wales that was most enjoyable. Worth making an effort to find if you enjoy the Shandy series, humor, or interesting use of language."
3,can't hear the vocals,"Without a doubt, Godsmack puts on an incredible concert. It's very high energy. The band members are excellent performers; however, you can't hear the vocals. Even when Sully addresses the crowd, his words are distorted and virtually inaudible. It's quite unfortunate because, if the vocals were clearer, I would rate this DVD a lot higher.The DVD is enjoyable only as a result of the overall energy that comes blasting through the speakers.For superior sound, listen to their Changes DVD. That is incredible. And, I do mean incredible. Unfortunatley, even that DVD has a flaw, the concert footage is broken up by interviews, and the song Voodoo is trampled on by interviews.If this Live DVD had the sound quality of the Changes DVD, it would be one of the best concert films ever. But, it doesn't.It's a shame..."
4,Just like being there,"Rather than repeat what other reviewers have already written, I felt compelled to address the concern others have made regarding the sound and vocal quality. This DVD sounds like the audio was recorded off an open digital microphone rather than straight from the soundboard. It has a bit of an echo to it, and at times the vocals can get a little bit too low in the mix. Overall it is a great DVD, but not the highly produced and polished ""platinum quality"" sound that some people have maybe come to expect. I attended a Godsmack show on this tour, and this DVD is what it sounded like to be there. If you like the band you will love this DVD."
5,This is quite impressive.,"I bought this book expecting a few pages with photos. This book is MASSIVE, folks. It's thick, it's huge and it's comprehensive. It's basically a timeline of events in Michael's life; some large, some not so much, but it tells you a lot about Michael that you wouldn't have known unless you were in his inner circle. There are a lot of pictures from Michael's childhood, the Jackson 5, interviews and talk segments. Some of the photos are heartbreaking; seeing Michael in his teen years posing happily, then thinking about what the man became.My only negative with this book is that it royally glazed over the Martin Bashir situation. It can be argued that situation really was the beginning of the end for Jackson. More details about what was going on there would have been nice.In any case, the book is highly recommended. Think of it as an encyclopedia for Michael Jackson; because that's exactly what it is."
5,A real good book!,"This is a real good book about MJ. No tabloid junkie, just the truth.Adrain Grant is a real good friend to Michael. It worthes you to keep for a memorial to Michael."
5,Help plz,"Hi I'm looking for the song when Stifler opens the door to his house to find the band geeks. ""We're looking for the party?!"".""What? There's no party here..""All I can make of the lyrics is ""Everybody"" lolz thanks."
1,very disappointed,We found that the songs that helped make this movie so funny and memorable were not included on this soundtrack. I was disappointed that they choose not to include these and felt the CD was a waste of money.
5,GREAT SOUNDTRACK,"I got this cd in the mail through a cd club b/c I hadn't send the reply card in on time. I was annoyed, but thought I'd give it a shot. It's one of the best cd's I've bought in the last 3 yrs and a great introduction to a lot of great new bands. I've been taking it with me to friends' houses so they can hear it for themselves. This compilation really rocks..."
3,I need the name of a song that is not on this cd,"Hey if anyone knows the song when Vicki is getting ready for prom in the movie and where Jim is getting his tux ready and talking to his dad please email me. It goes something like "" you used to look just like a saint, stumble into walls"" Thanks!"
1,What a Rip-off!!,"I recently watched Amercan Pie on cable and was aware just how much I was enjoying the soudtrack. Great songs are used throughout the movie. I then decided to buy the soundtrack and was horrified to discover that the CD has practically none of the featured songs in the movie. Instead it's limp collection of sound-a-like songs by dull sound-a-like bands that are barely even used in the movie except in the extreme back ground. A complete let down. This soundtrack CD should be held up as the biggest con ever and shouldn't be represented as the real soundtrack to the movie. It's more like one of those pathetic ""more music from..."" CD's that have become popular recently as a way to snag more cash from consumers. Absolute rubbish. Buy it at your peril!!!"
3,not too bad,"Pretty decent soundtrack. I really dig that tune by Super Trans-Atlantic. I hear they're gonna be the next big thing. The Sugar Ray song is also cool, and in general it's pretty solid all around"
2,"The only song I like on the CD is ""Sway""","I am buying this CD for the second time now: lost my original copy. The only reason I bought it in the first place was for the Bic Runga song ""Sway"" I fell in love with that song watching the movie. The rest of the CD is okay, but that particular version of ""Sway"" is only on that CD. There is another version out there, but it doesn't sound quite the same. I think it is totally worth the money for that one song, but that is just my opinion."
4,Raucus but lacking something,"Great soundtrack to listen to while driving! I bought it to get the last song played in the movie...right at the end when they're doing the theatricals. Of course, it's not on the CD!!! The worst part is that I can't find out what the song or artist is......The rest of the CD is pretty good, although there are a couple of songs that seem to drag on a bit."
3,Okay...,"I have not seen this movie. I bought this CD on the basis of knowing what songs were on it . I had heard Tonic's song on the radio and liked it. The other songs I thought would be good because I liked other songs by the groups who sang them(New Girl, Glory and Mutt) really weren't that good . But I'm writing this on hearing this Cd one time through, in the next week it really might grow on me. I guess the cd's okay, although I kinda wish I spent the $14 on something else."
4,Great for the nonprofessional athlete,"This watch is a very durable watch for an active person. It is a little large for a female having a small wrist so the hard plastic edge doesn't moldwell around the wrist, so I've had to place it a tad lower so that it doesn't hurt my wrist bone. But I think as a female athlete, this is one of ourbest options since the durable female Timex Ironman watches seem a little fragile with the ""stylish wristband."" and now more rectangular whichI'm not too keen on."
2,"Thin plot, lots of random facts about Cubans","There's nothing suprising in this book...the plot is predictable and the characters are stereotypes. Instead of reading a romance/mystery as it was advertised you get a dissertation on Miami Cubans...how they like their coffee, thier booze, their cars, their food, how they feel about Elian and Castro (as if we couldn't guess) and on and on. Even when the author stuck to the plot it was passable at best. My advice...pass of this book."
2,"Does cover the course, but I failed the exam.",I failed the CCNA exam wtih this book. You need another study guide to go along with this book or instead of this book to pass the CCNA exam.
5,Excellent book for beginner or CCNA 2.0 prep reference,This book is really great reading material and an excellent source of info for passing the exam. I passed my exam the first time I took it with the help of this book and Todd Lammle's.The layout and the order of how the information was presented was very helpful in bringing me up to speed with Cisco technology. A++
2,Not Her Best Effort,"Although her wonderful, intriguing novel ""Mulvaneys"" was one that was hard to put down, this collection of short stories leaves me wanting; I read it in the wee hours when I can't sleep, and I'm usually asleep within 20 minutes. Knowing she usually writes on the dark side of life's issues, these stories seem to me to be redundant and have excessively similiar themes...rape, illicit sex, fear, murder, alcoholism, etc. With a short story, we expect the unexpected, of course, but many of these shorties just left me asking ""what was that all about?"" There are a couple of exceptions: ""Fire"" had some depth and was emotive, but, sadly this book is not one I will put in my bookcase - it will go in the ""give away"" box."
3,what shall we do now,the part i didn't like is there is alot of information into finding out how to make a fun time for the kids
4,Some highs and lows,"This graphic novels comprises three or so stories from the JLA. A couple are good and a couple seem to be written high on drugs. Grant Morrison is one of the most inconsistent writers. I don't know why he's praised so much. One of the highs for me was bringing in the living members of the JSA. It's great to see the old Flash, etc. back in action. And seeing Captain Marvel (Shazzam) and Superman battling each other was also a great moment. Too many of the stories don't coincide well. (Some of the action takes place during the ""Batman: No Man's Land"" era.)And some are there just to setup later stories. Overall, although a mixed bag... it was an entertaining read."
3,Part II of the Thumb series,"This is a bad follow-up to the great Thumb Wars. The jokes aren't as funny and there are some moments where nothing funny is going on at all. Not a total waste though, some parts are funny and it's better than Bat Thumb.The DVD includes: A very funny commentary, a very unfunny insane commentary, a mock featurette, lame outtakes, deleted scenes, storyboards, and trailers for this, Thumbtanic, Bat Thumb, and the unreleased Frankenthumb."
4,Jamie Oliver Cheeky Chops Little Eats Crockery set,"I bought Jamie Oliver's 3 piece set for my daughter when she was one, once she was old enough to use them, they were a big hit, infact she's now 7 yrs old and still loves to use them. Because they were real plates not plastic it made her feel like she was getting to be a big person. I now have 3 childen and the twins (boys age 5 yrs old) both love getting to use this crockery too. Would love to get them a set each."
3,Pretty good,"Chris Barnes just isnt as cool as he once was. I admit the cover of Venom ""In a League with Satan"" is really awesome(...)I guess I just wish Chris Barnes would make death metal like he used to back when he was in Cannibal Corpse. This is still a good album if you are just getting into death metal. Experienced death metal heads need not bother with this album."
2,These hoses make your power steering pump whine.,"I installed one of these on my '02 Maxima a couple of years ago. Even after bleeding the system perfectly, my car still whines like an old Ford Grenada in parking lots. I really recommend spending the extra money for the factory Nissan hose instead of trying to save money with this one. This hose does seem to do the job though, and so far my power steering pump hasn't failed, but I can't imagine the noise it's making is good for it."
3,It worked But.....,"Hi, I installed the hose, it fit and worked but the car makes a humming sound coming from the power steering!!"
4,"Surprise , Surprise",This was a well researched book which was full of surprises. The most significant one was that Vera Atkins was not British and should have been incarcerated along with other aliens at the beginning of World War 2. This obviously shows that having connections in high places can lead to favoured positions. The section dealing with her connectionism with the Nazis regarding one of her relatives was on the weak side. How did she get to Holland? The book also shows the incompetence of SOE French Section under Maurice Buckmaster.it was well written with a good and exciting flow to it. Sarah Helm should be complimented for her work.
2,Better than his hypnotism books but still the same problems,"I really have to take this man's words with a grain of salt as I personally believe that his hypnotism and regression techniques are somewhat dangerous and certainly suggestive. I believe that only medical doctors should be allowed to carry out these very psychologically stressful procedures and here he conjures up all sorts of totally bizzare stories. Not that I believe that UFOs or Aliens are imaginary things, in fact I believe there is good evidense for them, but Hopkins ""may"" be influencing these people and that is certainly the most logical and scientific explaination for what is going on. This could all very well be the result of that yellow brick road to fantasy.Have a bag of salt beside you when reading this one."
3,accounts for something,"an old lady dies. a russian is tortured and killed. it turns out they are connected to an account, which turns out to be mysterious. someone else is connected to it too. and these people do not like meddling. they feel treathened. and they decide to act. but can they trust each other? the heir of the old lady decides to find out what's going on, and gets help fronm the intelligence. and somewhere along the line the fate of stalin's son turns out to be relevant. ok, done. the plot seemed a bit strange to me at times. but there is a lot of things going on. investiagtion, old fashioned action. ok read."
4,BeBop!,I love the Stray Cats and purchasing this cd reminded me of just how much. You can't listen to them without tapping your feet. They have a way of getting you moving to the beat.
5,Excellent for professionals and general public,"I am a psychotherapist and use movies with individual clients as well as groups. E-Motion Picture Magic is well written and user friendly. Ms. Wolz does a nice job of offering both theory and practical information. I particularly like her sections on using movies to release negative beliefs and her exercises that help the reader increase self-awareness by noticing reactions to film characters. Last, but certainly not least, I really appreciate, and have already used, her thorough film index. I will refer to this book often."
3,A lot like Boogie Nights,"The movie was great but the soundtrack is too much like Boogie Nights. Wish they'd used some of the more obscure songs from the movie rather than these. Still good but if you already have the Boogie Nights soundtrack, it's not worth it. Don't buy it for the Who, buy ""Who's Next"" instead!"
2,"Weak, weak, weak","Mystery novels with Jewish themes are somewhat rare, but if you're looking for a good one, this is not it. It was worth a quick read to ""kill an evening,"" but is far from a classic. The developments and conclusion were very predictable. You may prefer the earlier books in Faye Kellerman's Peter Drucker/Rina Lazarus series. If you just want a female detective, Sue Grafton's series (A is for Alibi, etc.) also gives a quick read but is much better."
5,What's going on with some of yall,"Ok. Some of yall said this lp left a bad taste in your mouth. Well this review'll give yall a bad taste in yours. If you can't recognize a sick ass album then yall need to find another genre. From hot lyrics to blazing beats, this has got it all. The Hiero crew fall off with their material until this.My favorite tracks are Trilogy, Interrogation, Acupuncture, and Soundscience. Besides these there are some decent/nice tracks and few garbage tracks. I gave this a 5 cause of all the bad reviews.. Probably a 4 to 4.5. Grab this one.. If you're already here researching this, trust me, you'll love this Souls."
3,"Good quality, but my cats don't 'get it'..","Well-made, sturdy, very easy to install and not an eye sore mounted on the wall.. However, neither of my cats seem to get the purpose of it. I think if the sisal actually protruded from the wall a little more (as opposed to being less than an inch out / almost flush), they'd know to rub on it. But, as of a few months after installing it on the wall, it remains neglected and a strange piece of 'decor'. I'm giving this a 3 stars because of the product quality, but I don't know that it will be useful for other cat owners either."
2,disappointed and overpriced,"We bought this ""new"" scratcher for our 9 week old Kitten. Product arrived ontime, but looked like used with some dirt spot on it. We have the product delivered on 11/29 where the sticker on the back of the product hand written ""09/03/2012"". No idea what that means. And it turns out our kitten is not in favor with the scratcher."
2,"well done, just a little dull","The title says it all: this book discusses gender and labor in the developing world. There is one article on India, but all the rest focus on sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Though this book focuses on men, most of the contributors are women. A professor of men's studies once wrote in a book that mostly women take his courses, so this doesn't surprise me.The chapters have many important thoughts. They point to how completed the issue of gender and work is, especially for poor countries with high unemployment and low GDPs. The problem is that this book is a little boring. The cover is dull. The chapters wonder a bit.This may be a helpful books for sociology and development studies majors. Nevertheless, most others will find the book pretty useless."
2,"new blues, old soul","R.L. Burnside is the last best representative of what the blues truely are, ""A reaffimation of life in the face of adversity"". RL continues his history of making music to lift spirits and make you want to dance. Even though the tone of this album is darker than his prevuious albums he brings some relief with his tracks, Miss Maybelle, Too Many Ups, and Nothin' Man. He also proves his ability by , not only remaking ""Chain of Fools"" but dramatically improving it. He lets us into his own soul with his heartfelt singing. Hard Time Killing Floor and RL's Story shed light on this artists troubled past and gives more depth to work by letting us see his past that made him a blues man. Some hard core fundamentalist may not like the modern style of this album, but I'm sure RL would remind them that Blues is just supoosed to be dance music. RL is by far the best living blues man performing today and this cd only proves it."
5,Great Cholent Recipes with actual measurements!,"I love this book. Finally, cholent recipes that have real amounts listed. A wide variety of types of cholent, normal and weird (see Spleen Cholent and Chocolate Cholent). My favorite so far is Red Cholent, which is a beany, barley, ketchupy type like I always attempted and failed."
4,"A mixed bag, but some very good Halloween bon-bons","""Bridal Jitters"" by Jayne Castle was an exceptionally enjoyable mix of sci-fi and romance, as can be expected from this author. ""Tangled Dreams"" by Lori Foster was fun and hot, but may not be everyone's cup of tea (there is some bondage, and a hero very turned on by control/domination in the bedroom). The other two were actually pretty bad. Hmm. Maybe I rated this book too high overall, but the Castle and Foster stories were well worth the purchase price."
1,Another step on a very long road ....................,"Ordinary middle-of-the-road jazz. Not exciting - the excitement came thirteen years later with the release of ""Inside Out"" (2004)."
4,Boombox ex is all it claims to be and more,"RIDICULOUS sound comes out of these little 2"" speakers and an impressive bass from such a small woofer. Package comes with earplugs with label, ""for the neighbors"". Perfect description for the amazing sound that comes out of these little guys. Go for the ex, not the regular boomtube. Makes so much of a difference"
4,Over-rated?,"While I enjoy the design and portability of this unit and consider it well worth the discounted price of $60 that I paid for it here at Amazon, it sounds more like 4 than 40 watts to me. It's twice as loud when I plug my computer into it as when I plug in my iRiver mp3 player [apparently the latter is not a good match]."
5,"Was Skeptic, but now I love it.","I never write reviews on anything, but after purchasing this item I have too. Before Buying this item I read all the reviews on many portable speakers. The boomtube had the most positive results, so I went ahead and purchased it. WOW, this is great, it has awesome sound quality. I am sooooo impressed. I wanted these to listen to while outside on my boyfriend's dock, it does the trick. I LOVE IT!!! Highly recommended111"
2,gospel gold - the carter family,"photo on cover does not match the contents on the cd --- from the cover it appears to be music from the carter sisters and mother maybelle, but basically it was much more modern music than the traditional music which they sung ---"
2,Not What I Expected,"I am a fan of Starbucks Green Tea Lattes, so I thought if I bought this and mixed it with milk myself, it would be basically the same thing. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. If you're looking for the same thing, this isn't for you.It tastes more like a Green Tea Latte from Seattle's Best (which I don't care for). It's also a really disgusting brown color, not bright green. It did not come in the packaging shown here.Basically this is a syrupy brown liquid, both too weak on the green tea flavor and too sweet. It tastes even more artificial than the drinks at Starbucks."
2,Tazo Green Tea Latte,"If anyone is looking for the original way Starbuck's use to make a Green Tea Latte with the melon syrup, this is not it! I loved the old way they made this, so I went looking for it on line. Was excited I found what I thought was it, but if I'd had this green tea latte I would have never wanted another one. Save your money and go to Starbuck's to get it. At least their new one doesn't taste like cough syrup!"
4,Hilarious and revealing,"This comic novel, in the form of an autobiography, tells the story of Ceferino, a Spaniard who goes to Mexico when he's 20. There he has a lot of adventures. The first ten years, he works for an uncle, and then travels around the country selling books. He gets to be friend and ""compadre"" of a typical Mexican. Later, he wins in the lottery and buys some factories. When he's older, he returns to Spain, only to notice he feels strange there. The he goes back to Mexico. The novel serves as an objective look on Mexico and the Mexicans, with a delicious sense of humor. It has not lost its flavor after 30 years or so, and it still makes for a very pleasant and funny book, from an author with great skills for the comic, the farce, and the sarcasm."
2,Nothing like Hair One or Wen,"I bought this because the bottle said it was a ""conditioning shampoo"". This is nothing like Hair One or Wen. This lathers like a regular shampoo and I did not like the way it made my hair feel; like a dried mass when wet.I suppose if you had oily hair, this may work for you. I just want to caution people from spending their hard-earned money on something that is not what it appears to be. (Also, someone mentioned it's not really organic)"
4,Well organized,Well organized workout. The segments are very doable for add-ons or do several together for a complete workout. The bonus section was a nice surprise.
5,I love this DVD!,This DVD is great! The instructions are clear and the 10 minute segments make it so easy to incorporate into any busy schedule. It is amazing that such small movements can really give you a great work out for those challenging areas of the body. I have been doing it regularly since I received it and I am already seeing results!
5,Mythical China,"Beautiful story about the loyalty women have for their friends. It could have been set anywhere, anytime, the story is universal in its appeal."
3,A little odd...,"I would say that this book had a very promising beginning but lost credibility somewhere in the middle. It was very interesting and intertwined the lives of ten women. Then it just got weird--Alexander incuded a lot of magical events that really did not seem to fit in with the story. It would have been a much better novel if she had found some real conflicts in which to confront all the protagonists. Overall, I was dissappointed...I had hoped that this would be good fiction, but I really feel that this book belongs in the fantasy category."
3,Good material for upper level study,"Pros: Good layout and order of material. Fairly clear in bridging theory with practice.Cons: Bad binding, had to replace once already. Some of the example questions are put together poorly; i.e. bad data, poor use of equations and material.Overall: 5 stars for effort and material, 1 star for quality and thoroughness = 3 stars overall."
5,A Bit of Yosemite in your HOme,"I love the DVD and watch it at least once a week, usually on a quiet weekend morning. The music is lovely without being intrusive and really fits the scenes that are presented. You will see Yosemite in all its seasons from the Valley to the top of El Capitan. It reminds me of why I love Yosemite so much!"
5,Found a little bug trapped in mine...,So I cloned some dinosaurs and taught them all how to play the instruments. It's rosin. How do you go wrong? Only if you're a pretentious elitist snobby symphony player that secretly masturbates in the practice rooms because no sane guy can stand how annoying you are would you ever consider this product too cheap for playing your instrument.
2,Virgin VS0200,"wanted these badly because a friend had them and they sounded great and then I got them and they didn't, so I threw them out. Kind of don't understand why they worked so well for him?"
2,Not an Inspired or Coherent Production,"This review is of this production, not this play--the play is great; this production, if it were music, would be frequently flat and off key. Some actors seem fine in their roles, and others are jarringly in-apt, if not inept. I want to like this performance, but I keep being distracted by the clunky manners of some these players. Also, the timing and verbal phrasing is often odd, even among the better actors, as if they were speaking lines from Ionesco, or another translated ""absurdist"" work. Saroyan is closer to lyric poetry than to absurdism. There are casting problems with the James Cagney version that he stars in, too, but he and his sister nail the poetic qualities of their lines--check out that film version from 1948, available for a pittance."
2,FYI - OR - get more for less...,"This release has the same tracklisting as ""Alcantara Cafe-Disc 1"" which at the time of this review is selling for a couple bucks... so if you want twice as much music for half the price check it out... you're welcome!"
2,Inadequate content for anyone wanting to day-hike Whitney.,"Having day-hiked Mt. Whitney in the summer of '98, I felt the book did not bring out the true spirit of what is involved in planning and executing a one day ascent to the summit of the tallest mountain in the lower 48 states."
3,POOOOR selections!,"As a Sox fan and an old baseball game junkie - I have about 30 dvds with old games on them, I figured it would be hard for me not to want this. BUT the game selection is uninspiring. I already have 2 of them (75 WS GM 6 & the game from 1967).Why would they include the entire game from 2007 with the 4 homeruns in a row when that WAS the hi-lite of the game while only showing Bill Mueller's walk off HR from the game on 7/24/04? The 7/24/04 game with the A-Rod brawl and the great Red Sox comeback is the one that should be shown in its entirety - it is pretty much my favorite regular season game I've ever watched.The only one I'd really pay to see again is Pedro in the '99 ALCS - so I may try to pick this up on the cheap on Ebay some day."
2,Great art with a corny story!!,"I have always heard really good things about this series but finally getting to read it I wasn't thrilled. First, I should say that Barry Kitson's art was spot on old school art. It fit perfectly and still looked contemporary. Waid and Augustyn's plot and dialogue is where the problems lied. Its one thing to try to evoke nostalgia but here the writers just seemed to copy ancient dialogue. The plot while large seemed so scattered its hard to imagine these heroes acting the way they did. Overall, this series added almost nothing to the legacies of these heroic staples."
2,It starts off okay -,"- but quickly loses steam like most 12-issue series.I wish Crisis on Infinite Earths had never happened. This whole practice of ""retconning"" is ridiculous. So now I'm supposed to believe that these heroes were a team in 1980? Black Canary making references to Yoda? Jeez... Anyway, there are plenty of cameos by heroes and villains to keep you busy. Just don't expect much in the way of story.The art looks very impressive at the start - the shading is great and adds real depth to the color. But as it goes on, the shading goes away, leaving the art flat and lifeless."
5,Very Pleased,"I decided to take a chance on this watch despite some of the negative reviews. I've had it a couple of months now and I am very happy with it. I get loads of compliments on this watch. So far I have had no issues with the self wining mechanism, but I will update this review if I do. This is my second Invicta watch and I couldn't be more pleased with them both, I highly recommend."
5,"Definitely ""The Least Worst Of""","A collection of pretty much all of Type O's greatest hits...although most are butchered or remixes there's really nothing to complain about...as if they were to put the full lengths on here the cd would be over 2 hours long! They still put the 13 minute ""Unsuccessfully Coping..."" on here...and some catchy new songs like ""It's Never Enough"" Which sounds like it should be covered by Deicide sometime...""**** YOU GOD!"" Heh...all in all this is a fantastic walk through the park...all that is negative...and the new songs and remixes make this worth your $$$$."
2,Read each word backwards in order to understand.,"Nehw I draeh tath Type O Negative saw gnimoc pu htiw a wen mubla, I dias ot flesym I evah ot teg ti... Os I did. Ti dekcus ssa, ti saw tsuj a gnikcuf tsetaerg stih. Yeht dluoc evah enod retteb. Fi uoy od ton ekil em esuaceb fo siht weiverp, uoy nac og kcuf flesruoy. Eid snamuh."
2,Interesting topic but repetitive and chaotic writer,"The topic is excellent and very interesting from a human, spiritual as well as historical point of view. However, Connor's writing is so repetitive, slow and chaotic. He repeats the same ideas and facts over and over again, which makes the reading boring and annoying. In addition, he presented the story in such a chaotic way. So there is no time continuity or subject continuity. Suddenly the reader jumps from one subject to a completely different and uncorrelated one. Also, historical events are presented in a chaotic way. Keppler would be mad to see so much chaos in his story!But what annoyed me the most was the repetitions of facts and ideas."
4,Another in a Justly Popular Series,"I suppose this can be considered an update of perception a decade down the road from its publication and review by Amazon readers. This is not among the best of the series, but, if like I, you have come to like visiting the people at the Temple, idiosyncrasies and all, it will prove pleasing. The Mystery Question is, what is going on at the Health Ranch which is marketing for the Mistress (or Tyrant_) of Temple affairs, a diet matzoball. In the process of digging up the answers, Ruby, the former Rabbi's wife, runs into all sorts of dilemmas. In the Temple, of course, there are the usual amusing goings-on.To take off on a point by another reviewer, you don't have to be Jewish to like the book and its characters, you can be Jewish and dislike them. Most general readers of what has come to be called ""cozies"" should find this good light entertainment."
2,I don't understand how people think these are great headphones.,"I bought the Sennheiser PX100W's based on the reviews of others and on their looks. They matched my white iPod. However, I don't understand how so many people think these are good headphones. They simply are not.At the same price point, the best headphones I've heard - and I've heard many - are the Koss PortaPro headphones. The PortaPros may not be as aesthetically pleasing as the white PX100, but they are worlds away better in audio quality. The PortaPros have a wider and more faithful sound spectrum, and can be pushed to a much louder volume with far less distortion than the PX100's.Although the PortaPro headphones don't fold into a neat little case (a feature of the PX100's that I found absolutely clumsy), they come with a lifetime warranty, as opposed to the PX100's 2-year warranty.The PX100's were returned to Amazon within a day."
4,awesome,"I give it a ""4.5""i dont think there are better supra-aural headphones in this price range --- and i tested a bunch including the sennhesiser px200. The px100 has much more bass and (for me) they fit much more comfortably over my ears than the px200.hooray for these amazing supra-aural cheap headphones. The art of listening has not yet been completely ruined by the horde of nightmarish stools, known as in-ear sound-isolating headphones.I give it a ""4.5"" instead of a ""5"", because they feel a bit too fragile."
5,Don't underestimate this comic!,"The Young Avengers is a surprising well written and drawn comic series. The dialogue is humourous and very tongue in cheek at times. The collection covers the first 6 comics in the series, so throughout this book you are still just meeting the main characters and learning about them. Even so, it quickly drags you into the story with the great dialogue and action. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a bit of fresh air! I can't wait until the next release!"
3,Poorly Written,"I received a complimentary copy of Her Last Plea as a member of the Dorrance Publishing Book Review Team. As a survivor of domestic violence myself, I really looked forward to reading this book. Although I commend Miss Jones for bravely writing her sister's story, the book was a disappointment from a literary standpoint. The book contained too much dialect and not enough factual information. I felt as though I were reading a high school paper, which was a huge disappointment. The ending was even more disappointing. Miss Jones ends her book by saying ""From the Jones Family: Before you think about pulling the trigger, just remember that you're committing a deadly crime. Don't be like Joseph Black!"" I felt this was a very weak and immature ending but then the book itself is not very well written. Visit dorrancebookstore.com to learn how you can become a member of the Book Review Team."
5,"Got this for a gift, saved money and made them happy!",As we all know this is a good show on TV. It was requested as a gift and was able to get both of them season one and two for under 30 dollars (almost).Great deal for a great show.
2,Very biased and directed at abused women,"I'm very interested in exploring the femine face of God. However, I found this book to be centered on abused women. As a result, it is extremely hostile towards men and male-based religion. The author is very well researched, but she is content to gloss over her research in the text with references to the sources in the bibliography. At times, she seriously misrepresents her facts or draws conclusions that are not universal. There are times when the book points out injustices to women that I think a lot of men go through as well. I thought the book was extremely biased against men and was disappointed in such a hostile exploration of spirituality."
2,Another Fad Diet,This is just another fad diet that doesn't work. Count your calories and exercise and you will be better off.
1,This guy eats yogurt and string cheese for lunch--EVERY DAY!,"No kind of life.If you want a real solution, try Geneen Roth.Try ""How Much Does Your Soul Weigh?""If you're into suffering, buy a hair shirt.I seldom throw away a book--donate them to the library instead.I was afraid someone would READ this one, and believe it. It's in the trash."
3,Interesting Book,I was a little disappointed in this book. The diet plan is not well laid out and leaves a lot open to interpretation - but perhaps that was the idea. I am following my own interpretation of this diet so I am glad that I purchased it.
2,No New Info for PJ Fanatics,"This book is basically a gathering of articles and interviews regarding the singer/songwriter PJ Harvey. PJ Harvey was a big influence on music in the 90's and inspired a lot of the styles in artists that are around today like the yeah yeah yeahs.I found that this book did not delve very far into her life story and this is probably not the author's problem but because PJ Harvey is a private individual. I am not a die-hard fan and I did not read any information that I did not already know. The book is short, easy reading.If you are a collector of PJ Harvey related items then you should still buy this book for your collection. If you are just looking to read more about her, this is probably not the book for you."
2,"Teresa Brewers 16 Best (Her choice, not mine)",Some of the ones from the 50s but not the memorable ones. Mostly from her Jazz accompaniment groups and night club gigs. Not worth getting unless you're into lounge acts at the neighborhood bar.
1,Talentless hack tries to sing jazz...,"Terea Brewer never has been and never will be a jazz singer, she always will be a middle of the road pop singer. This CD where Brewer tries to a sing a couple of jazz satdards like New Orleans just shows how awful a singer she is, her squeeky Betty Boop like voice is unbearable. Stay away from this if you have any respect for the art of jazz singing."
2,Where's the Beef?,"This DVD gives us less than an hour of Roberta Flack on stage performing with her band and she talks through a full 25% of that time! Don't expect a satisfying concert experience from this disk. The performances are disappointingly perfunctory and a shadow of the inspired music found on those treasured early recordings. The sycophantic audience seems to make the performance seem even less satisfying. Well....maybe you had to be there. If you are a Roberta Flack fan stick to the audio recordings for now. Perhaps a video performance worthy of her talent is yet to come. This DVD has too much talk, too little music, and none of the old Roberta Flack fire."
5,"KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH YOUR SONG!!!!!, THAT SONG IS MY LIFE!","THANK YOU ROBERTA FLACK FOR HAVING WRITTEN MY LIFE IN YOUR SONG, BELIEVE ME. I REMEMBER THAT I ALWAYS LIKED THAT SONG SO MUCH EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T KNOW ANY ENGLISH IT WAS MY FAVOURITE SONG!, NOW THAT I KNOW ENGLISH YOUR SONG HAS FULLED UP MY LIFE WITH LOVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT ""KILLING ME SOFTLY"" BECAUSE THAT SONG IS 100% MY LIFE,I LOVE YOU AND GOOD LUCK ON WHATEVER YOU DO!, (BY THE WAY, I AM 22 YEARS OLD)"
3,***Lets Get Ready ***,"I was so excited buying Mystikal's new album ""Lets Get Ready."" When I was done listening to it, it wasn't as good as I had expected. 3 stars is still above average but I thought it would have better tracks. His lyrics are tight and he has a unique flow, it's just his beats he could improve on. There's only 3 good cuts. I still think this is his best album yet but his next will be better. This album is all Mystikal and has very few featured artists. This factor also brings the album down. The album features Da Brat who's good and Outkast who's also good. The three good tracks are:""Sake your a**"" ""Danger"" and ""Neck Uv Da Woods.""If someone asked me for my opinion on this cd I would say it's alright. If I could get a refund, I would deffinitely say no. I still like mystikal and the cd I just think it could be improved on."
1,A Waste Of Money,"I really want to give this CD a better rating because I like Mystikal, but I gotta be honest. This CD is terrible. The only great song is Danger. Everything else sounds the same. I recommend Unpredictable or Ghetto Fabulous because they are better than Let's Get Ready. Sorry Mystikal! But next time try harder!!"
1,Use something else,"I purchased this in order to obtain a handy, convenient-sized, English-Italian dictionary. I thought the color coding would also make for easier reference when trying to find word definitions and translation quickly. Unfortunately, this dictionary is not very comprehensive. On a number of occasions, I could not find several words from my Italian reading text and was forced to utilize other dictionaries, even though some of those were also ""pocket"" editions. The color coding looks great, but so often did I have to use another reference work for my purposes that I finally put this aside. Conclusion: if you're looking for an effective, useful pocket dictionary, buy something else."
3,Too technical,"I love her books but this one was far too technical with lots of references to the Canadian system. Less a story, too much technical details."
5,Crofts never better,"While Jim Seals (of Seals and Crofts) is absent, Dash still has the goods. The beautiful voice, the mandilin work is flawless. Besides a number of new cuts, there are some old faves from the duo days. Plus an added treat for fans is the fact that his little girl has grown up and is singing with him on some cuts. The instrumenyals are very jazzy, just like the old days. This is a classic from a class guy who has been missed. Do another one SOON~!!!!!!!"
2,REHASHED,"It's great to know that Dash Crofts is still around and still picks the mandolin. That being said, TODAY is not his best foot forward back into the ring. It's practically a Kenny G album with mandolin. Dash is capable of better and hopefully the new, forthcoming Seals & Crofts album will prove that.Standout songs: ""Hollow Reed"", ""Today"""
4,memorial day for rapp,"Excellent book from Vince Flynn. His hero Mitch Rapp facing a daunting threat but you always believe he,l prevail in the end.A great story well worth a look even if you are not a regular flynn reader."
4,The West Wing meets 24,"In this latest Mitch Rapp installment, terrorism goes nuclear and Rapp must use his skills as a CIA operative to attempt to stop them before Washington, DC and the surrounding area is destroyed. All of this happens amongst election-year politics and Rapp's efforts at saving the world are frustrated by those who only understand political considerations, not real life terror threats.Once again, Vince Flynn's writing packs a punch and this is another page turner. As is typical, some of the plot is a bit unbelievable, but that is part of what makes it so fun and exciting. This is a perfect read for the beach or a lazy weekend."
5,A message within,"Vince Flynn tells it the way it is... or should be. The message, superbly presented, is that to win the war on terrorism one must fight on the terrorist' terms. Simple interrogation is out-moded and will not bring results. We are combating fanatics who have absolutely no regard for human life... ours or theirs. All this wrapped up in an excellent yarn."
4,Mitch is the Man!,Mitch Rapp continues to evolve and become a bigger force. I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys reading intrigue involving the CIA and our government.
5,Great read!,"I love this book, it was hard to put down. The whole Mitch Rapp series is well worth your time."
5,"Mitch Rapp at his best - well, he always is!!!!",I've followed Mitch Rapp (through Vince Flynn for) years and years and just love the intensity of every situation - i cannot put them down once i start!!
1,This Book is Blatant Right-wing Propaganda,"This author is a raving, right-wing hack. I couldn't even finish the book. The story line is very simplistic and predictable, and every other chapter involved gagging on the author's simplistic right-wing preaching:Brown People = EvilTorturers = CourageousDemocrats = Weak/ShiftyIt's impossible to enjoy this book unless you're a big fan of right-wing propaganda. If you're a thinking person who is paying attention, you'll despise this author and abandon the book before finishing it. Definitely a book designed to appeal to knuckle-draggers.There should be a warning on the cover. I'll never buy another book by this author."
5,Good quality!,This was a Christmas present for my Dad. It seemed of good quality and warmth for our Winter weather. He wears it with his coveralls out to the farm
1,You Can't Make It,"...not from this video unless you are already a skilled seamstress. However, there is no new or innovative information that would be of interest to an advanced sewer. The video is of a woman's hands pointing at a finished project set on a table. The hands point to parts of the project while a voice, as if reading from a script, narrates. The hands do not display or move the project. If the narration comes to a point that isn't shown, the hands stop pointing and your left looking at a still picture, rewinding and guessing what you are supposed to be looking at. I assume the next picture is a couple of completed steps but I don't know what or how they were done. There are no demonstrations or explanations. I gave up on guessing and shelved the video. I rate it terribly overpriced."
1,have house and no furniture,"I am extremely disappointed with the fact that now that I have a Dora house that was bought as a Christmas present, I am unable to find the furniture anywhere. In my opinion the dollhouse is useless without the furniture and should have come with the house.By the time the furniture becomes available, if ever, the dollhouse will be long forgotten and I have wasted $50.00 for nothing. [...]"
3,Where is the furniture,"I have also bought this house for my 2 year old daughter. Though I was aware of the fact that the house didn't bring any furniture but i never thought that it would be this difficult to find. My daughter still plays with it everyday, I think I am more disappointed about the furniture than my daughter. Does anyone know when the furniture will be back for sale????????"
2,Disappointed,"Like many other parents, I've got a house and no furniture. Shame on Fisher Price and all the retailers out there who are selling the house and there is nothing available to furnish it with. I'm disappointed and I can only imagine the disappointment of all the kids out there who may get a house but no furniture. Very short-sighted and poor planning."
2,Highly Priced,"All the 4 furniture sets comes in plain box, still the price is same as you by them seperately. Saved money in packaging, also selling a lot should have lowered the price. What's the use of buying it together. A lot of small pieces, really hard to find all of them after kids finished playing with them."
4,Hibachi,I was surprised at the heavy duty construction of this product.Very well made and engineered.I have used this hibachi at tailgating parties and performs very well.The drop down door is useful for adding additional charcoal.The only drawback I can find with this procuct is the inability toraise or lower the cooking grate.But by adjusting the amount of charcoal compensations can be made.
4,I love this game,"One of the more difficult games I've ever played using a light phaser. You watch as the action unfolds. The main guy is a medic in a war zone, his job is to save the wounded soldiers. You have to take out all of the enemies who are shooting at your character before they can kill him."
4,Nice Mystery From a Master of Horror,"I have never understood the chapbook industry. Paying a lot for a single short story just doesn't seem right. But, when I can find one used for a decent price, I might check it out.Joyce wants to be a mystery writer and she has just had her first story published. She is very gung-ho about writing more stories. But then she gets a chance to see the dirty side of crime first hand. She records the details in her mind for use in future stories but first she will have to survive the encounter.I am most familiar with Laymon's horror writing where he excels at showing the dark side of people's personalities. He uses the same ability in this little mystery as young Joyce must adapt to survive.I wouldn't recommend paying a lot for this one but it is worth reading."
3,fun at the begining,"it is a fun game but after 5 games it starts to be easy. its like the other team wants you to win. but i have no problem its fun and you have allot of characters to choose from (my team is cindy, jenny the teenage robot, sandy cheeks and spongebob. and our colors are pink and black)i suggest this game if your 8 or 9 its funner when its hard."
4,Rumble,Some very good Doo Wop and upbeat songs from 50's - must have along with Paragons meet the Jesters for the ex hood crowd
3,Bad Design,The cover glass fell out of the light within the first 5 minutes it was up. The light gets very hot and I guess the glass expanded or something. The locking clip above the glass is horrible. I recommend using something to keep the glass in place and/or put a small screw through the top of the clip in to the frame of the light. I called the company and they are sending me a new glass cover and it sounds like I am not the first one to call them with this issue.
4,"very helpful, but a few wrong answers","This book keeps you on your toes and makes civil procedure manageable regardless of how good / bad your prof is. Aspen just came out with a new edition (red cover); as a 2L who did well in Civ Pro first year, I'd recommend this highly."
3,Good,This book was not as helpful for my Civ Pro course but in general is was helpful in understanding general stuff. Arrived in a timely manner and in good condition
4,Brillant novel that had me up all night!,"The sixth novel in the dark tower series ""song of susannah"" could arguably be the best in the series. I remember having a session with this book that lasted about 7 hours long. By the novels end your left begging for more as it closes out with one heck of a cliffhanger. Kings imagination really shines here, but whats new?"
3,Worst book of the series?,"I just finished reading this book and it felt empty. The book clocks in well over 400 pages but the read was quick and I didn't feel like I got much from the story. This story, as you would expect, revoles mostly around Susannah and Mia and some new details are revealed about the quest. While some pieces of the story are great...others were out and out boring. If you're a fan of the series get this book for sure. I wouldn't recommend against it but it is probably, in my opinion, the weakest of the 6 books already.Also some pieces felt really cheap...Stephen King's part in the story and what was under the masks ...."
1,THE NEVERENDING STORY?,I couldn't finish this book. It just started to seem like a more grown up version of the neverending story. Don't waste your time
4,"Sixth of series, unbelievable, yet so believable!","Steven king is/ was a master of si fiction! I wish there were more answers at the end of this vi volume. Totally unique as the man who wrote it! See you at the end of the path, comma-la come to all!"
3,Hack!,"1- write a 900-page manuscript.2-hack it in three.3- sell.I'm talking about DT 5, 6 and, apparently, 7. Stephen King is a very talented writer, no doubt, but COME ON! DO SOME WORK HERE, Mr. KING!! HELP US TO KEEP BUYING YOUR BOOKS!!!You are rich already, so how about some fine writing?"
4,The dark tower song of sussanah,"I love stephen king and his imagination never ceases to amaze me, song of Susannah was no different I enjoyed it immenselyAnd my aim is to finish all his books ."
4,Classic King,I've really enjoy the Gunslinger saga and this book is no different. This is my first audio book from the series and I very much enjoyed the storyteller. I was alittle disappointed with the ending but he always keeps me coming back for more.
1,What a load of Rubbish!,"What a dissapointment! I've read all of Stephen King books, and this is by far the worst! This is the worst book period I have read in years. The way he inserts himself into the story, like some kind of acid trip he was on turned me off completely to this tale of stupitiy. And the magical turtle??? Wha? Rat people and Hawk people? What the heck is going on. This isn't a book this is a drunken fantasy.I'm was so looking forward to this book and the end of the series, but I won't spend another dollar on this kind of garbage."
4,It was OK,"The book was in a bit worse shape than i thought, covered with scratches instead of a few, and the dust jacket was ruffled, but the book in its own self was in perfect shape and delivered on time"
3,Not sure about it,"The Gunslinger series came forth in a blaze of glory - the books though sporadic were at least very in depth and well thought out.By this book I think I was feeling the books were then being rushed a little - this instalment of the Dark Tower series left me wondering a little bit about the magical journey that had been promised, the unseen roads not yet travelled.Not as good as the earlier books in the series.But that said, if you are reading the Dark Tower books you are going to read it anyway."
3,readable...but only to get to the end (next book),"I have been an avid fan of these books since the early 90's when I first read the series up to the waste lands. Like most readers I have been eagerly awaiting the final books, and even had grown frustrated. This book is easily the worst of the books to date, little actually occurs in it, and I found myself growing bored (something I never thought I would say). That being said I cannot wait to get the seventh book, since I know it will be a great one, and this book is definately worth reading just to get to it. The ending is finally near..."
4,The other author,"provides the most interesting aspect of this chapter . It takes a while to regain interest in the story, but King comes thru. The other author is a confessional that seems to say interesting things. ""The Dark Half"" again? Bring on the final."
5,Loved it!,"Someone give Stephen King an award. Oh wait, he already has a billion. Have they named a street after him yet?"
1,A 500 PAGE EGO TRIP!,go on--inflict yourself on us poor hapleess readers by writing yourself in your own book...Sk obviously cant look over the mount rushmore like proportions of his ego!!It was the last nail in the coffin of this seriously tedious book that goes precisely no where...I do hope the final volume makes up for this fiasco...and please SK do not appear in that one...SAPRE US!!
3,Biggest cliff hanger of his career?,"I read that this book would contain the biggest cliff hanger of King's career. True, it left off with a cliff hanger (I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read the book yet), but when I put it down after page 411 I just didn't care. There was no urge to go to Maine and steal book 7 from Steve's personal library. I mean, Jake and Callahan and Oy are barely mentioned, the garbage between Susannah and Mia is just a little drawn out (true it is about Susannah, but c'mon...I was bored after the first three ""stanzas"" of Susannah and Mia)Still, it is a Dark Tower book, and it does touch on all the characters, even if only briefly. It continues the story, and I'll be out buying book 7 with the rest of the Tower Junkies.And the way King wove himself into the story is thought-provoking, no doubt, but it's also a little annoying.A lot will like it, a lot won't. I'm kinda on the fence with this one...guess I'll have to wait on book 7."
5,"May Not Be as good but still, its King...","I'm an avid Stephen King fan and I love all of his books. But my favorites are his entire dark tower series. And although this one is a little dull at times (all right, A LOT), it still has that Stephen King touch.I think it was very very clever to stick himself in the story as a character. I don't know how he thinks up of this stuff, but its just amazing.I hope that when he wraps up the series in September, he ties up the loose knots he left with the cliffhanger ending of this book, cause I wont be able to wait too long"
2,Wandering and pointless,"Book 6 is without a doubt the low point of the series, although its immediate predecessor also left much to be desired. Many plot elements are introduced and subsequently ignored. In most cases that was for the best. Monsters and vampires may be part of King's M.O. But they do not belong here. Only its association with the greater Dark Tower series brought this book up to a 2-star rating."
5,Imagination Gone Wild,Again I am following them through another journey. this book as the others in this series do not disappoint in making the imagination work overtime.
1,BEWARE of this Low Fi Dreck,"The label sez ""digitally remastered"" - so I paid $13.94 for Part 1 (essentially disc 1) of the original two-disc set - figuring the sound would be greatly improved over the original vinyl and the subsequent CD release (1990).Turned out what I got was a cheap, dreadfully low-fi rip of an analog source. Sounds like a 5th generation recording at best.No wonder they now offer it ""used"" for under a buck... Still not worth it..."
3,dissapointed,"I drink a lot of tea, 10 cups per day. I drink many greens and white along with oolong. I have been drinking Prince of Peace Premium Oolong but read that Tie Guan Yin was a superior Oolong. I tried this Foo Joy and although nobody is knocking my door down begging me to be a taste tester I prefer the richer, nuttier taste of the Prince of Peace Premium. It is also less than half the price. I am sure I will try others, it is in my nature but I do like the Prince of Peace."
2,Poor packaging,"Item had poor packaging, looks opened and reclosed, may have been a previous return.Also, this was a gift, it looks more like a used re-gift"
5,Book One: The Knit Stitch,I purchased Sally Melville's knitting book for the Einstein Coat pattern. I found the directions to be very clear and she has very clear directions with pictures for any techniques in the patterns. Very good for beginning knitters and challenging enough for advanced knitters.
5,Must Have Book,This is by far the best knitting book out there for beginning knitters. She teaches in easily understood language and explains in detail without being condescending. Her love of the craft shines through on each page. And the patterns!!! I have rarely found a book that actually had more than 1 or 2 patterns that I liked or wanted to try. This book is great!!!
5,Fantastic Book,"As a book and knitting fanactic I can't begin to describe how great this book is. This lady has a great sense of style. I loved everything in this book and can't wait to begin knitting from it. Also, can't wait for the rest of her books to come out. I can't recommend this book enough."
4,my 8-year old loves these!,"My 8-year old boy loves these devil sticks. He took circus arts in gym class and at day camp, where he was introduced to them. He now comes home from school and immediately picks them up and practices his tricks. Great for developing hand-eye coordination, confidence, and old-fashioned persistence."
5,Great Music--Inspiring Documentary,"I watched this movie for the great music performers--Ben Folds, Polyphonic Spree, Rufus Wainwright, etc--and it turned out to be so much more than I expected. The stories of the LGBT youth were so eye-opening and inspriring. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent Reference Book!,"After reading ""CCENT: Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician"" by Todd Lammle, I really need a book that I could quickly reference for commands in IOS. This book definitely helped me out in many different situations. Highly recommended!"
4,Welcome Back J,"I'm the biggest basher of post Lou Barlow era Dinosaur Jr. around. I always felt that J lost a few steps after Bug and a few thousand after Where You Been. Sure the later albums had some cool tracks, but the majority was not good. This is J's strongest album in almost a decade...hands down! The production is fresh and clean (Kevin Shields! When is the next MBV album???) and there are some new sounds floating around which hit the mark. J, you've won me back to the fold!"
1,Waste of monye,"I needed fenders that were TRUE clip-ons. No where in the description did it say that you needed brazons of some sort. I have a high end cross bike that I use in the winter for commuting. I can not use these, waste of money."
1,Call Me Lucky,"I purchased the DR-MH30S in June 2006. Everything worked great. The audio was good, picture quality really good, and it was dependable. It worked like a charm; I couldn't have been happier. The only problems I had were from operator error. That is until December 2006. It looks like the six-month curse other buyers mentioned caught up to me in the way of a near fire -- thank God I was home. It's disturbing to walk into your living room and see smoke creeping from your entertainment center. After a frantic and unsuccessful ""check for heat"" of all my electronics, and their wires, I cut the main power. Then one-by-one each component came off the shelves and yep, you guessed it, the JVC DVD Recorder was the only one that smelled of smoke. Funny, it was only vaguely warm. Each component was housed on its own shelf with more than the recommended ventilation. But hey, other than THAT little incident the product would have received a 5 Star rating from me."
2,IR doesn't work,"There was no code for Motorola cable boxes, so my IR controller never worked. When we switched to satellite, I tried again and it still didn't work, but it seemed like by then whatever powers it probably ran out of juice and there is no replaceable battery or anything like that. I want to let people know who are searching for solutions to problems with this unit about an error I encountered. When either the set top box for cable or satellite was enabled in the setup options, the unit would not timer record. It could record manually, but if the timer was set, it would lock up when the recording started. I would have to either unplug or press and hold power and stop to reset it. It took me a while to figure out that the set top box settings were to blame. Hopefully this will help anyone with the same problem (although most people have already given up on trying to get these machines to work properly.)"
5,BUY THIS BOOK!,"This novel is a hilarious romp through the seedy sides of Los Angeles and Las Vegas, until it becomes a love story, and then it's both a dark comedy and a poignant look at impossible relationships and the lengths people go to find intimacy. It's great."
4,"But who has time to watch all 6 games, buy Shea Goodbye Instead!","Saw this at Best Buy for $44.99 and Shea Goodbye for $19.99. I live near Flushing and have seen the construction of The Overblown Travesty of Citi Field everyday going to and from work and this looked interesting.This says it has 6 complete games and totals more than 16 hours and Shea Goodbye has just the highlights and totals only 76 minutes. Not really into baseball too much but living in NY less than 5 miles from Shea Stadium thought I might pickup and watch once Shea was destroyed and that $600+ million retro Ebbets Field with the 20 year $20 million naming rights joke called Citi Field replaced it. unless you're a real diehard Mets fan who wants to watch 6 complete games like they show Yankees games on MSG or YES network here in NY, I'd stick to the 76 minutes Shea Goodbye."
4,A must have for any Mets' fan...,"Simply put, it is a must have for any New York Mets fan. While I wish there was more drama and build up to some of the excerpts - Todd Pratt's walk-off homerun against the Diamondbacks as an example - I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. It will be something I can use to look back on the past and remember with fondness, as well as something to get me through the rough times when the present isn't going so well..."
1,pure deception,"Bought these steamers based on the picture posted. They were substantially shallower that the standardm but charged the same price, no mention was made of the fact they were not standard depth"
3,Seems okay at first. Minimal use so far.,"Haven't used it on an impact wrench yet, but they seem nice, and cover the range of common sizes. It's important to have a 3/8 to 1/2 and vice versa.I would love to know why the label says that the package and the product contain a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer. Seriously, both the package and the product?"
4,they've held up well,"These have held up great so far. I do home garage auto work, brakes, fluids, axles, and most everything else and these work great.no breaks or issues."
2,Photo misleading...,"Nice looking badge, TINY.No way is it as big as the photograph portrays. It says frequently bought with a holder with chain necklace. Looks good in that photo. Nope. When it comes in the mail you go ""wha??"" It's tiny, not realistic.For Halloween, great. Buy it. For a theatrical or film production, it's a joke."
5,THIS CD IS REALLY ON FIRE AND THERE'S ABOUT TO BE A WAR!!!,THE HOT BOYS IS REALLY ALL THAT AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THE HOT BOYS BECAUSE THEY GOT THE BLOCK ON FIRE.
5,One of the tightest c.d.s out of the south.,"15 year-old lil Wayne is the tightest rapper in the C.M.R. camp, of course next to B.G., and Juvy. The whole record is full of hard flows and fresh beats"
1,Kill that Noise,"Me being from the South I must say that people from the South fell like they've taken over the industry. Kill that the East Coast is the foundation and that shouldn't be forgotten.Outkast Goodie Mob, Eightball and Scarface are true Southern Hip hop. Not the Hotboys.So people who like this Hot Boy stuff wake up it's wack."
5,It tells the truth about themselves and others.,"I like the CD because I can understand what they are talking about. That's the only CD I listen to so many times a day. I understand were they are coming from in the song ""Dirty World"" because we can see it more and more everyday. I don't just like Hot Boys but I like the whole Cash Money Records. I had a cusoin to live in Magnolia Projects and I know from experience what it is like to live there."
1,Save your money!,"The book offers nothing new. It was written by a nonurologist who is stuck in the past. Curtis Nickel's book is a better buy, IMO."
3,Very dissatisfied!,"Description was very deceiving. Did not get what I expected to get, however, I was not given any problems with the return and my money was refunded to me promptly!"
4,Nice Plot,"I rather enjoy movies with an historical twist, particularly African American films. Danny Glover and Denise Nicholas did a fantastic job together on this one. Very good!"
5,This album has got it going on!,When I first heard this album I was sure it was goint to be a hit. Profyle teamed up with the right people and have created this masterpiece. Go out and buy it right now!
5,TIGHT AND SMOOTH,THIS CD IS SOOOO TIGHT...IF YOU ARE AN R&B FAN LIKE ME THEN YOU WILL DEFINITEILY LOVE PROFYLE!I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PROFYLE FOR BEING THE SMOOTH GROUP THAT SO MANY OF US RB FANS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR..OH YEA JOE (WHOM I ADORE) HELP MAKE THIS CD FLAWLESS! A MUST PURCHASE.
3,didn't fit my stroller,"This product is well made but unfortunately did NOT fit into my BOB Revolution stroller that has a 5-point harness - so I had to modify it to fit. Once I did that, it's great --- but thought it would have fit in the first place."
3,A mixed but pretty bag,"I ordered this collection on the strength of a few authors I had read before but never really fell in love with the work as a whole.There are a few charming pieces, a few gems, and a few pieces that struggle with their narrative and never quite get off the ground.""Flight"" as a theme may be a bit too airy and loaded with cliche to build a cohesive set of stories, but these authors -- many of them not yet well known -- try their best."
4,Nice Anthology,"Flight is an anthology published by Image comics. The idea is to have young creators make short stories about flight. There are six volumes out there and this is the first one. I enjoyed reading it. The nice thing about anthologies is that if you don't like one story, the story is short enough to not matter and if you like one story, you can look for more things from that author online. This anthology has several good stories, I liked both stories written by Kibuishi, the editor of the comic. Both of them were funny. Near the end of the book there's another story I liked a lot, it is called ""The Bowl"". It is a nice story told without words, the art is very strong and the author, Clio Chang, was able to express complex things through her art. Other stories I liked include ""Hugo Earhart"" by Jake Parker, ""Tug McTaggart, Circus Detective"" by Phil Cravenand ""The Maiden and the River Spirit"" by Derek Kirk Kim.A good comic, worth checking out."
5,Good Buy,"This coat and hat rack was easy to mount on the wall studs, and holds the weight of winter coats and jackets. I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Mad mixing here!,"THE greatest part about this CD is the first track: ""Snow"" by O.R.N. It's just incredible!The second greatest part about this CD is the mixing; too often, DJ compilations take the form of one track jammed up abruptly against the other with little or no mixing between songs. Dimitri's mixes are far from that tired method, and provide a smooth move from track to track. Keeping music sewn together the way Dimitri has takes time to make the beat work and time to select the proper music so the songs work together. There is one small trainwreck that he quickly recovers from, but this compilation was mixed ""live,"" according to the CD label--you have to be forgiving.Mind your volume control a bit as audio levels tend to rise slightly through this CD.A good housey-trancey compilation... Worth the price if you want to experience Dimitri's mad-skill mixing!"
1,Worst mixed comp ever,The mixing on here is the worst I have ever heard on any comp ever and I have over 300 mixed comps. The tracks are ruined by how bad the mixing is cuz this so called Dj thinks a long mix is a good one and he proves that wrong. He should of mixed this digitally because this just makes him look really bad.Its funny I had this back in '99 then lost it and I dont remember it being this bad but thats before I started to Dj and really getting into EDM. If there is a comp mixed worse than this please let me know cuz I've never heard it.
1,Great if you can get a train that rolls,We purchased my daughter this train for Christmas and was very disappointed when we took it out of the package and found out that it didn't roll on its own. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one and the second train worked for 3 days before it too stopped rolling on its own. My daughter loves the flashing lights and movement of the train but is very frustrated that it no longer moves across the floor.
4,Fun for Infants and Toddlers,"My son got this toy as a gift for Christmas. Overall I like it. The train moves and plays a song when you push the steam stack. My kids have no interest in the blocks, but they play with the train pretty often. I like the songs it plays. Be warned that if you get this toy for baby and you have a toddler, the toddler will try and monopolize it. It seems to go through batteries pretty fast, especially if it is being played with on a carpet. (Pretty fast is defined as once every couple of months.) Once the batteries run low, it no longer runs, but the songs still play, at least for awhile. It also has an on/off switch, which is great when you put it in a toy box."
5,Easy Does It,"I bought this because of having to use both hands on the old manual..and the hose popping off the fitting. CH has a winner here, and it is affordable. I use a small 1.5 gallon compressor and with this gun - the job is done effortlessly. Now I can be sure all fittings get fed!"
3,Just ok,"I bought this at the recommendation of a friend. I found that it was very messy to use and took very long to warm in the microwave. I would not recommend this. Go to the salon, it's much easier"
3,GReat Watch - Bad Band,"Let me start by saying that I really like my 750 Shark X Watch. I like the style, color, look, and operation of the watch. Since I have had it there have been no Mechanical issues with the watch at all. However, the Polyurethane band is another issue. Within the first year of owning the watch the part of the watch band that holds in the extra part of the band broke. Luckily I found the manual on line and was able to order a whole new band, even though I only needed the little piece of the band. A new band cost about $20 after shipping. I ordered the new band and had it for about 7 months when the same stupid little piece broke again....... Ugghhhhh..... So do I pay another $20 for a brand new Band when I only need that small piece. If they fix the band issue this watch gets 5 stars....."
3,Good Short Book About a Brave Band of Brits,"Not too indepth, and heavier on the Pearl Harbor comparisions than I realized. I would have preferred more information on the Taranto raid. Still, it's a good read about the night a handful of antiquated biplanes literally sank Italy's hopes of success in the Mediterranean theatre of war."
3,Missing a socket,Nice kit for my son to start building his tool box. But the 7mm deep 1/4 inch drive socket is missing. Higher rating if all the parts were included. No time to return before Christmas.
5,Just what I needed,"It has everything that I needed and more. So far it has had everything that I have needed. I guess if it doesn't I can buy them individually or find them off someone, which is no big deal at all"
5,Great value for the price,Great value for the price. I could have paid 8 - 10 times more for the MAC name. The rachet is identicle to the MAC rachet. Save your money and buy the Stanley set.
5,A trip through African world music & then some..,Upbeat songs and Africian influences in River of Souls. Beautiful sounding 'All There Is' & 'Holy Road' is very inspiring. 'Voice for Peace' is another good song. His voice sounds strong and clear. Fans will really enjoy this one because it is very different from his previous works.
2,decent read,"its interesting....boring as heck. but summarizes author's arguments decently enough. would recommend it as a school book, nothing more. better elsewhere"
3,Good while it lasted,"I bought this for my husband and while it was good for a while, the band just snapped one day. So from now on I stay away from these bands and go velcrow if I can. They are better for work atmospheres."
5,Great Value for 15 Bucks!,"I almost didn't get this watch because I thought the size of the numbers displaying the time looked a little small and I wasn't really in love with the design.Then I got it. I'm REALLY happy with how it looks. The picture doesn't do it justice.Do I wish the display was a little bigger? You bet. Do I wish the band was a little softer/more flexible a plastic like my Oakley? Yes. But that watch is easily over two hundred dollars now and this watch is 15 bucks.So, I'm a happy camper. Great value."
5,"Islam, back to the basics of the philosophy.","Imam Feisal's holds my attention and has taught me a lot about Islam and its history. It is aimed at people who are not knowledgeable about Islam--be they Muslim or not. Anyone who wants to know what the Koran says and how it was originally interpreted with find this interesting. Feisal has gone back to the early days and described the ideal then compared it to how practice has evoved and changed away from its original flavor. The approach is thoughtful, positive and hopeful. He makes Islam appealing to a non-Muslim in a very matter of fact way. I hope it is read as much by Muslims as by others, both here and overseas."
2,Window 98 Demo a Flop,I have taught Kindergarten in CA's Public Schools with computers in my class and I have a preschool daughter. On the rhyming segment the demo didn't introduce new words to rhym and some of the pictures were hard for me to figure out.
3,Beware of the subtitles,"Graubard is a gifted writer, I grant. The subtitle of the book on secrecy and deception is what drew me to read this, but I was in for a surprise. Instead of following the sub-premise, the book gives what amounts to a biography of each president since 1901. Their early lives and rise through politics plus the votes and moments at political conventions culminates in the outcome of the elections -- these details occupy roughly half of each biography, and therefore have little bearing on the secrecy and deception employed while President. What also bothered me were Graubard's personal criticisms of some of his (still living) sources. Wherever a world leader found our American president weak, incompetent or out of his league, Graubard shares the insight as if he agrees. The book is a useful reference for quick insights into our past several presidents and their earlier lives and certain highlights of their terms of office, but beware that the subtitle is misleading."
5,Our first Little People Purchase,"This was our first Little People playset purchase and my 18-month old LOVES IT! He uses his hands to move the Little People around and loves to hear the sounds. This is a GREAT toy, we will be buying more playsets in the future."
2,John and Edgar,"All I have to say is, Johnny and Edgar don't sing even one song together on this album!!! Nuff said!!!!"
2,leave blister on back of foot,"I bought these for snorkeling and when I put them on with my fins I started to get a blister on the back of my foot. They are very soft neoprene so they offer limited protection on the foot. also when I took them off to walk on the rocky areas, they do not protect the feet very well so you might be better wearing a heavy sock with fins vs spending the money on these."
5,Great bodysurfing fin boot,"Unlike the picture at left, they have an open heel, so water does not get trapped in the boot. I use a Force Fin (best fin in the world...thank you Bob Evans) for bodysurfing, but they require a boot. This boot a strap on the side to hold the fin strap (I also use a fin leash), so everything is very secure."
2,No value for the money,"I bought these socks for my Hawaii trip to do some snorkeling, but they are of no use, doesn't fit properly. Total waste of money."
3,Well made and strong but...,I use these with my Body Armor bumper. I had to make modifications with a grinder to get full upward/downward motion (big ingress/egress driveways) where they bolt to the bumper. I would have thought they would mount to the bumper without a problem since they are both Body Armor brand. They worked great with my existing tow bar with no modifications needed. Very strongly made with thick steel.
5,Alatriste,Great movie that accurately depicts Spains waning empire with the defeat in Flanders. Historically accurate with some artistic liberties in the script. Can be considered a grand Historical novel.
2,Very Disappointing,"In order to compress half a dozen novels into one film so much is left out that the plot stumbles along disjointedly. Book one alone would have made a good two hour film.Even the best attempts to condense to a single theatrical release stumble. Think of Das Boot. Sadly, Alatriste is comparable to having series like Harry Potter, Star wars or The Jewel In The Crown reduced to one movie."
5,WELL WORTH VIEWING,AS SOME PREVIOUS REVIEWERS STATED IT'S DIFFICULT TO CONDENSE INTO 145 MINUTES THIS WONDERFUL STORY BUT I FEEL IT'S AN EXCELLENT VERSION OF THIS EPIC TALE. VIGGO IS GREAT AND IT'S FULL OF DRAMA WITH VERY REALISTIC BATTLE SEQUENCES.
3,"I liked the books, the movie is only ok","If you enjoyed the novels, the movie is enjoyable, but somewhat disappointing. By attempting to cover all of the novels in a single movie, there apparently wasn't time or budget to provide sufficient context. If I hadn't read the novels beforehand, the movie wouldn't have made sense; since I had, it was amusing to determine from what novel each scene was pulled. It is a shame that by not concentrating on a single novel at a time, it was apparently impossible to provide sufficient screen time to developing a fuller sense of that era. However, while some events are taken out of sequence compared to the novels and others are combined, the differences between books and movie were not jarring. The opening scene provided great atmosphere and I did enjoy the movie. The casting was good - Viggo Mortensen is the ideal Alatriste as were the actors portraying Inigo."
4,Excellent portrayal of 17th century,"The best portrayal I have ever seen of 17th century warfare. The storyline is a bit predictable, but the action scenes and dueling are wonderful."
4,Pretty Funny!!!,"This movie was about what I expected. It had a few hilarious moments. Anna Faris is always adorable and funny. Faris stars as Ally Darling. A few days before her sister's wedding, she looks back at all the guys she's dated (slept with) to see if he was the one. Chris Evans plays Colin, who helps her track down all 20 of her ex-boyfriends while slowly falling in love with her. I'd recommend WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?!!!"
3,Ok movie,The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I can't really remember what the movie was about. Maybe that should tell you something.
1,Bad Disc - What's Your Number?,I received the DVD in a reasonable amount of time but when I went to play the disc in my dvd player I got the message that it would not play. I could not make it work no matter what I tried.How can I return this DVD and get my money back?
1,What's Your Number?,"There was a moment -- albeit a very brief moment -- when it seemed like Anna Faris might have had the potential to join the elite ranks of successful comediennes in Hollywood. Unfortunately things haven't quite yet panned out for the bubbly Scary Movie alum, who's lately spent most of her time in bad films, including her latest, What's Your Number?. Here, Faris plays Ally Darling, a recently unemployed woman who comes to the realization she's slept with a lot more men than other women have. Hoping to put a cap on that number, Ally revisits her old boyfriends to see if any of them have grown into permanent relationship material. Co-starring Chris Evans, Joel McHale, Andy Samberg, and Zachary Quinto, What's Your Number? could have possibly been better with a stronger script and a better director; as it stands, while I found Faris sharp as ever, the film around her just is not that good."
1,Dramatization of degeneracy. Vile and disgusting.,"The main character of this movie is a filthy whore who plunges the depths of self-degradation in pursuit of some man to love her. Her male romantic interest is a morally corrupt libertine who uses and disposes of an endless series of one-night stands. The script contains some of the most obscene dialogue and situations I've ever heard or seen in a movie. Yet, for modern America, this is a ""romantic comedy"", and the movie's target audience of twenty-something, White, urban professionals will identify with the utterly soulless, amoral and promiscuous protagonists. What a sad commentary on our people. What a depressing testimony to the depths to which humans can sink."
2,Not good at all,"Not sure why I rented this. I guess I was extremely board and for some reason the blonde girl, her face and voice bugs me. Its as she is always doing a duck face...Anyway, the movie sucked."
4,Decent movie,It was a good movie. Not horribly unbearable but like any other romantic comedy currently out. Worth a few bucks to watch but nothing I would buy.
4,What's Your Number?,A nice love tale about not judging the book by the cover. If you do than you may never meet the man or woman of your dreams. A sweet love story with a happy ending.
4,Cute movie,Funny movie. Easy to get into. Sorry guys but it is a chick flick. But at least it isn't sappy.
3,"Pleasant, but not original","If ever there was an example of a romantic comedy in need of sexual chemistry, this is it. Both leads in the film are appealing, talented actors, but it's a stretch to feel any real romantic heat between the two. However, if you're willing to look past that (and I was), you'll find a pleasant 90 minutes of entertainment that is similar to such TV shows as ""Happy Endings"" and ""The New Girl"" in its vibe and writing."
2,"Amazon is good, Sharp is... I'm not sure.","I purchased this microwave from Amazon early in July and received it within a few days. After hauling it to my apartment, setting it up and plugging it in, I put some popcorn inside and waited for the magic to happen. The microwave shut down and reset itself after 20 seconds. Annoyed, I tried again, but the machine continued to turn itself off for no reason. (The popcorn was ruined.)The Amazon return policy is nice. You press a few buttons online, print out a return receipt, put the microwave back in its box, drive it to the nearest UPS, and you're done. They sent the new microwave quickly, as well. But the new reviews people have been posting for the Sharp 230K worry me. The replacement microwave works well so far (I've heated one cup of water), so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping this one lasts.In conclusion, get a microwave from Amazon, but not necessarily this one."
1,Arrived defective - Quits after only a few seconds,"This microwave shuts off after only a few seconds of heating each time. This happens, new right out of the box. Returned it."
2,crappy,"Sorry about the title, but that about sums it up. Unlike the image portrayed in the photos of this microwave, it is cheaply constructed. The over-excited door shoots open, so keep breakables out of the way and maybe put a bumper on the wall. The worst part is how unbelievably weak it is. It takes 1.5 minutes to heat up an already warm cup of tea. I don't think that it is broken, just cheap."
1,Defective!,"I ignored the reviews on this site and others that complained of a loud, tinny rattling sound when operating. I assumed that maybe it was an older model they were reviewing, or a fluke with a isolated batch of product. I got my package yesterday, set up the microwave, and upon using it for the first time I was disappointed to discover that the one I ordered was no exception. Brand new, out of the box, with a very loud, tinny rattling sound coming from somewhere in the motor. Very frustrating to have to repackage this, schedule a UPS pick-up, and send it back to Amazon for a refund. HUGE waste of time!!! I previously owned a similar Sharp model that was reliable for 10+ years, but this model is definitely a dud!"
4,WORTH THE PRICE,"I have usually owned Sharp microwaves and have always been extremely pleased with them. This particular model is good although it falls short of a few options that the other Sharp's that I have owned had. One being that it is not a full-power microwave which I did not know because I did not fully read all the information on it. But it works fine since I don't cook with it. I use it for reheating food and beverages and that's it. BTW, it was ordered on a Sunday (normal delivery) and arrived Monday late afternoon. I'd say that's quite superb."
3,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get a more compact microwave than I had for the last 20 years. I really only use it to heat up my food, or to bake a potato (it used to take an hour in the oven). The first microwave I ordered had a dent in the top, so I had to return it. This was a problem because I'm an elderly person, so had to arrange for someone to pick it up. I had it replaced but was disappointed to find that the new microwave was noisier than the bigger one I had. I've bought many things from Amazon which were fine, but I don't know if I would do it again after this experience."
4,Does The trick!,I love my little microwave. Looks sleek and takes up about half the counter space of my old clunker! The rotating platform is a big plus as well as the nice bright light inside.The only drawback for me is that I have to use a magnifying glass to read the control buttons and the plastic cover over the buttons was wrinkled in a less than attractive way when I recieved it.The product was delivered punctually and it is well worth the exceptional price.
4,"Wonderful item, quick shipping","While consumer guides have found the features and controls on the Sharp only ho-hum, we love it. That's because it works well and doesn't break down. In 20 years, we've owned four small Sharp ""carousel"" microwaves, each of which lasted for five years with no problems. Compared to our other home appliances, this is pretty impressive. My only complaint is that even the little models keep getting bigger. Since we used ours to heat leftovers and defrost things, all we need is something small and dependable."
1,Too light,"It's way too light and the metal and hard plastic feet do not grip a Formica countertop -- when you try to open the door, the oven slides all over."
1,Cheap microwave broke after 3 months,Very cheaply made. Seemed like an ok buy especially since I don't use a microwave all that often. After 3 months it stopped working. The motor would work for 10 sec and then stop for 5 while the plate in the microwave is still rotating.
5,WORKS GREAT,"This microwave works perfectly, is compact enough for where it is to be used, and all the features are easy to use. I also want to say that I was very impressed at how quickly I received this -- I ordered it on a Tuesday and got it by Friday of the same week!"
1,Stops every few seconds,I bought this microwave a little over 5 months ago. Recently it's been stopping by itself every few seconds. Sometimes it even resets and I have to re-enter the time. I've seen numerous posts about the same issue. UGH! I just contacted Sharp. I hope the replacement doesn't do the same thing.
2,short life,"I bought it in end of April 2010 and used only by my mom who is petite and quite short to use over the range GE profile. In the past few months, I noticed that the leak (the wall on the right side of microwave was unsealed) and made loud noise. She did not complaint because we wave tight budget. But when I checked on-line for leak, it is very dangerous. So I have to buy a new one Panasonic NN-SN651W with double the price of this Sharp."
4,Juat what I needed,"Perfect for your counter top. Compact to fit in almost any area, but large enough to heat up and cook your food. Great for side dishes and if you're cooking for just a few people. Heats fast and has a modern look."
1,cheap appliances waste money.,"I owned this microwave for about 2 years before the buttons began to fail. First it was the +1 min. button. No problem, I thought, I'll just start using the number buttons. Then the 2 button wouldn't press, so i would work around this by entering times like 1:59. But how can I work around a microwave with no start button?"
3,"Nice Selection, rough remastering","A German release with a selection of songs that is well tuned to the contemporary ear. Includes great numbers like Puttin' It On, You Oughta Be in Pictures, The Music Goes Round and Round, and Goin' Home, which makes it a nice piece despite a somewhat uneven remastering. I suspect these were remastered from period records rathern than directly off acetates or master recordings.If you want to know more about the Boswell Sisters you should visit [...]."
2,Pirates Jersey wrong size,"I was very disappointed in this item. It was supposed to be a child's medium jersey, but it is more like an INFANT's jersey. It was a present for my nephew for his birthday, so I had one very disappointed child, with no presents from me."
4,Relaxing music,This is good music to relax to. Nature sounds mixed with great music makes the perfect getaway.
4,Small book with big ideas.,This is the third edition of this book the material seems up to date circa 2007. If you are looking at small boats and have not purchased yet this book will be very helpful. If you own a small boat this book will suggest many good ideas for upgrading your boat. I like the organization of this book excellent TOC page; good index. Chapters are well organized and clearly written with summaries at the end of each chapter. Length =240 pages. 9 Chapters. Covers used boat buying and trailers as well. If you are looking at the purchase of a trailer sailer this is a good guide. If you already have your boat there are still many good ideas to be found here.
2,"Use your ""Spider Sense"" before buying...........","I bought this poseable spiderman doll for my 3yr old. He absolutely loved it! We bought it because it was soft and he likes banging the doll into walls, other action figures and yes sometimes people. We were disappointed however because after a few weeks of playing with it, it tends to separate at the joints and/or neck. Inside of the soft spongy material there seems to be a metal ""hanger"" to make it poseable. When it separates the metal sticks out and can hurt the child. Because my son loved this action figure so much, we threw out the hazardous ones and bought new ones when they became ""dis-jointed"". After the 3rd one, we hid it and eventually threw it out. If your child is going to be very ""active"" with this toy, it will not last long. Repeated posing (or bending) will break it, just like the old clothes wire hanger."
3,Good meditation track.,"This is a simple track, mainly bird song and woodpecker drilling. It has that deadened acoustic feeling that you get in a forest, enhanced by the sense that the noises are coming sometimes from close by and others from far off.The woodland feeling gives a womblike feel of security to this soundtrack which makes it great for meditation or just chilling out. Like all the CD's in this series, it provides a good blanket of white noise to keep out the distractions of the outside world when you are relaxing.Also in common with the other CD's in the series, the price is great, so you can't really go wrong. I prefer the versions without a music track, but that's just personal taste."
5,Colorful and fun,"My 7 month old loves this book! It's so colorful, and he loves to feel the pages and ladybugs. This is a great first book!"
4,Mallika is Hot!,"Mallika Sherawat once again sizzles the screen in Kis Kis Ki Kismat. She plays the supposed role of a billionaires mistress in this hilarious comedy, which amalgamates all aspects of comedy in Indian Cinema."
5,Inspirational Journey - and it is.,"I started listening to Randy a few years ago and have really enjoyed his music, especially his Christian inspirational music. I bought this CD about a month ago and have really enjoyed it. I started playing the guitar about a year ago and went to this CD to find a song to learn and perform in church. I was not dissapointed because I found a couple songs I would like to learn and perform."
2,"I am sorry, but I didn't like this CD","I am sorry, but I didn't like this CD. I like country songs and gospel songs. I have almost all cd's of Randy Travis, Ricky Skaggs and Paul Overstreet. But the songs in this CD are very sad and slow (exception: the third track). I hope Randy Travis launch a new gospel CD better than this one."
5,HP Laser Toner,My wife requires the laser for her Notary business and so far this has been superior to the factory toner at way less than 10% the cost.
5,Amazing,"This book is great , simply amazing ! Came right on time :) read it all the time over and over !"
4,Informative and Motivating,"I found this title highly informative and motivating. The lessons and supportive arguments constantly remind you of the author's primary message.The presentation is easy to follow. Overall, it is a great book.The major challenge with this title is the level of repetition you may observe. Probably for emphasis, major points are repeated time and again. This may cause you to quickly flip through some of the pages. The repetitions also had the effect of making the points communicated rather diffuse.These drawbacks however are unlikely to prevent assimilation of the valuable truths proffered in this book.Repositioned: The Journey"
4,The guy keeps putting out great stuff...period,"Once again Dwight Yoakam has put out a great CD. There is not a whole more to say. I have all his CDs (except the imports) and he is still one of the few artists whose music I buy without hearing it first. I don't give it five stars only because, as someone mentioned earlier, he has set the bar so high in the past I can't put this at the top of the Dwight heap.Thanks again Dwight..."
5,Very cute game!,"Our daughter just received this as a gift for her third birthday. She & her sister have been playing it all morning!I think it's a smart toy, when you pick all the pigs in the correct order of the verse, the toy mixes up the pigs for the next player! The voices of the pigs are adorable also!"
5,Great Game - Beats VIdeo Games,My kids loves this game. I remember when my eldest son was 2 (now 12)I bought this for him and he played with it for hours on end. I bought it again and my 4 and 6 year old boys play it and they also enjoy the game. It's nice to see that it was still available. It beats them being glued to video games and its more rewarding.
5,This is a HOT SMOKIN' DEAL,"For those that have used impact drivers you know. For those that haven't you should know. These are great tools and this particular one is an amazing bargain. These tools don't use clutches like cordless drills so you can easily overtighten a screw but the feedback given by the impaction mechanism clearly indicates, at least to me, when the screw is tight. The advantages are you can drive much larger screws without effort and, perhaps even more significantly, any type of back torque on your wrist. Additionally, you can drive screws much faster with an impact driver than you can with a clutch type drill."
3,Its a good add-on tool but wont cover ALL your needs,"Makita TD020DSEW 7.2-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless Straight Line Impact Driver Kit -- Purchased this thinking it was the utlimate power screwdriver but it has its draw backs. It will set screws great with little effort on your part but1). its one speed so there are no slow start-ups.2). There is no pistol tigger (its on the side)3). The other fault with the unit seems to be the battery.I charged both batteries that came with the unit (thats a plus) because I like to have a hot spare battery but after letting it sit idle for a week - I had NO power in one of the batteries so I had to recharge it.Whats to like about it..The bag that holds the unit is great, The LED lite is good but you have to hold it while holding the unit while holding the trigger (get what I mean).. The power to drive on a full charge is great and it came with a small set of screw driver bits."
5,a thriller that has aged pretty well,a book that sat on my bookshelf for a long time. i was not a fan of the movie and thought the book would be mundane but surprisingly it was an enjoyable suspenseful read with an original idea employed.
3,"Good story, but the characters seem like cartoons","Ira Levin's mid-70's thriller about a Nazi plan to repopulate the world through cloning and assassination certainly keeps the reader's interest. The story is well-paced, and the thought of such a plan is chilling. But many of Levin's characters seems cartoonish, including the Simon Wiesenthal-ish hero. A good story that needs richer, more drawn-out characters."
3,Ridiculous Fun,This book is wildly implausible but irresistably fun. Levin adds the gravity of human responsibility to his nutty mad-scientist story to keep it from flying off into camp. The suspensefull ending is particularly satisfying.
4,Overall Good Book,"In the area of World War Two, Hitler historical fiction this is an interesting story. The author created a plot that is getting close to possible with today's technology. A lot of the historical facts introduced in the book are accurate and the author uses these facts to build a complete story. From a wiring point of view the book is above average, but not an edge of your seat thriller. The story is complete, the plot is a good one and there is adequate character development. It is a good book that is worth investing the time."
5,A Must-have Book for All Knitters,"If you knit, you must have this book. Here I am, a person who has been knitting for over 40 years, and I learn something new every time I pick up the book. I have already made 3 projects - each more beautiful than the next. This book is a wonderful addition to your library and a wonderful book to give as a gift to any knitter, beginner or experienced."
5,"everybody is hooked on ""Shut the Box""","Played this game at a tavern in Williamsburg with the grandchildren. Came home and bought 3 for different families with different ages. Everybody is now hooked on it - fun, educational, well made, quick, one person can play or a whole group."
5,This book throws new light on an old mystery.,"In this book the author endeavored to ascertain whether or not his ancestor was guilty of the crime of which he was charged, and for which he was executed. Campbell was forthright in his conclusion that he could not determine to his own satisfaction guilt or innocence beyond any doubt. In the process of his research, he raises many questions about the actual role of the detective McParlan. He also raises serious questions about the legality of the trials. The alleged ""leader"" of the Mollies, John Kehoe, was exonerated and pardoned by the Governor of Pennsylvania. Campbell deserves our thanks for shedding new light on what is turning out to be an old scandal."
5,Great story!,I didn't want to put this book down once I started reading it. I found it suspenseful and a quick read. I am excited to find another book by this author.
5,Well Done !,"This is the first time reading Mary Higgins Clark's Novels. She is a great author of suspence and well written.Daddy's Little Girl kept you guessing and unsure until the end.The details of her characters was great,they are people much like the people in real life.I will read more of Mary Higgins Clark's novels or all,if there as good as this one. I am going to buy another of her novels or even more than one of her books now. If you have not read any of Mary Higgins Clark's novels , you have to read this one. You can not put it down! It is so good that you just keep reading to the end.I have a friend that is a big fan of her novels and now I know why! Now she can one more fan of her novels to the list now. This book Was WELL DONE!"
3,DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL,"This is the first book I have read by MHC. I thought it was a good book! I couldn't wait to read it each night! From the reviews above, I take it her other books are much better than this one! That is great to hear, I now have other ones to look forward to! I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to reading mystery!"
1,This Book Was Such a Disappointment,"I am such a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark that I went to the book store oping to get a copy of Daddy's Little Girl, the day before it was released. No luck, but I did buy the book on the day it was released and decided to spend my lunch hour reading one of my favorite authors' works. What a disappointment! This story is told in a series of endless flashbacks and even the passages that are supposed to take place in the present are a continual rehashing of the the back story.I wanted to return my book but out of respect for Clark, decided to hold to it. I'll be waiting on line for her next book too, but this time I will read several chapters (I enjoyed the first four chapters available on line) before I make the investment."
3,"""DISAPPOINTMENT""","I TOO HAVE READ ALL OF MARY HIGGINS CLARK'S BOOKS AND HAVE NOTICED A BIG CHANGE IN THE LACK OF SUSPENSE IN HER LAST COUPLE OF NOVELS, IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE IS MELLOWING OUT! THE FIRST TEN BOOKS SHE WROTE WERE REAL NAIL BITERS, WHERE YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN TO DO ANYTHING!THE SUSPENSEFUL SITUATIONS THAT ELLIE GETS INTO, COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SCARRIER! I KNEW AHEAD OF TIME HOW THESE SITUATIONS WOULD TURN OUT. THE FEAR WASN'T THERE, IN THE STORY, LIKE SO MANY OF MARY CLARK'S OTHER BOOKS HAVE.THE WRITING IS GOOD, JUST NOT SUSPENSEFUL ENOUGH. I HOPE MARY HIGGINS CLARK GOES BACK TO HER ""SCARRY"" WAY OF WRITING AGAIN. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER BOOK BY MARY H. CLARK."
1,TERRIBLE,"I usually enjoy MHC's books, but this one is AWFUL! I borrowed it from a cousin, thank the Lord, or I'd be right at the bookstore returning this. This book was not only boring, but predictable too. Not a good combination. And I totally saw the ""union"" at the end. Just terrible.the pieces fell together to cleanly. It was so bad, I was wishing that the heroine was positively wrong in her assessment of who killed her sister. The website thing was a bit much too.Don't read this...if you must, find it at a library!"
2,Not up to the standards,"This book was my choice for my book club. I had originally chosen ""Second Chance"", but realized that this was a sequel.So my book club ended up with this. I was not really thrilled about this book. To me it seemed to drag and the suspense was far and few. Maybe I am just used to Mr. Patterson's writing that keeps me on the edge of my seat.The book stressed the guilt that the character Ellie had been carrying for her life. She felt guilty for her sister's death and that was prominent through the book. It never really had the suspense during her journey to investiagte her sister's death. Just a little bit of a let down."
