1,Do not order if you are in Canada,My order was seized by Environment Canada and I received warning letters stating that I had to be licensed to import this product. The letter and inspection report indicated the items would be kept by the Crown - which means I will not get my money back. Strictly Health SHOULD KNOW the rules and regulations of exporting products such as this. I am very disappointed to say the least.
2,Save your money,"I purchased this particular brand of Hoodia because i read that this company was certified to sell this product . It is supposed to be pure and of the highest quality. I don't fell that there is any difference between this brand, and any of the other brands that i have tried, except for the price. I am disappointed."
5,An Incredibly Engaging Book,"This book is not simply a travelogue. Jason Elliot is clearly a poet at heart. His book manages to teach the reader about Afghan society and culture while telling of his travels in such a way that leaves the reader spellbound. When I finished the book I felt both sad and happy at the same time; sad it was over and so happy to have had the opportunity to read it. When one can say that about a book, one knows it is truly a great read. Read this book; besides giving you countless hours of pleasure, it will enrich your life."
4,A superb mouthpiece,"This mouthpiece came with my bass clarinet I bought over the summer unbeknownst to me. I own a Buffet 1193 bass clarinet and noticed this mouthpiece tucked away in the case when I bought it used. The mouthpiece is superb, the sound and attack is very good (mind I have not played on Forbes and tried a Bay but found it too finicky). The sound is richer, more centered and rounder and fits the bass well. The only reason why I gave it four stars was because it is a little picky about the strength, quality and age of the reed one uses. A fairly new Vandoren 3.5 works well with the diameters of the mouthpiece, like the Bay it is easy to over blow and squeak on some notes in the altissimo and clarion if the reed is not up to par. Overall a great mouthpiece, similar to Vandoren B40-45 mouthpieces but it has a higher quality of sound and nicer feel to it."
4,Pretty fun,"I have loved this game! I have pretty much completed it, I mean, once you have had a kid there isn't really anything new that will happen, but there is a lot of things to do in the game and it keeps you busy. Such as all the animals you can buy, you have to take care of them. The thing is, when you get all the musical notes together and give them to the harvest goddess, she ""rewards you"" by making you sit through 5 minutes of credits. Other than that, it's a good game. I liked the fact that there were so many people to choose from to marry, and you could choose if you wanted to be a boy or a girl."
4,A very fun and addictive game,"I thought this game was great. It was a definite improvement from Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life. You can do a lot more and it keeps you occupied. The only disappointing aspect about it is that your kid can't grow up. Otherwise, I definitely recommend it."
5,AMAZING!,"an amazing game for farm loving games<3 i absolutely ADORE this game<3 it is a definite must have game! its great for kids, teens and adults<3 all ages and all sorts of fun :D get this game!"
3,Inferior press,"Some time ago I bought a 48 oz Bodum press, which is fantastic, but about twice as much pricewise. So wanting another one, thought I'd give this one a go. While it does make coffee, it doesn't seal quite right: grounds can leak around the plunger disc, the coffee gets cold fast because the cap leaves a gap. Overall, this feels and acts like an inferior product. It gets the job done, but not nearly as nicely."
1,Main track missing in action,"Not at all what I expected. The main song ""Tomorrow"" by Salif Keita isn't among the selections for this CD."
2,Les Miserables Ã  la Dickens,"This film was disappointing, particularly in the awful dubbing. The voices bear no resemblance to the stars' actual voices and I was shocked to find that it was not in French with subtitles. No, it did not say that it was, but I guess I assumed it would be, not being a really well-known foreign film. The Javert doesn't hold a candle to Charles Laughton's evil portrayal; this guy just looks like a dithery older man who somehow got into a bad situation. The Cosette also seems like an airhead. Though the story can hold it's own through almost any treatment, the dubbing was the biggest problem. It did, however, point up the Dickensian situations and characters."
1,Not like the original VHS,French language with English sub-titles.The original VHS was enjoyable to listen to.This New Release DVD is full of profanity.I tossed it in the trash can.
3,Robin Hood,"This is a classic so I was expecting a very clear rendition, lot of noise in many scenes. Color is great but looks faded also on most scenes."
5,Great Hollywood Classic,"Great bargain on Amazon for a movie that I've enjoyed seeing over the years. The DVD is very high quality and showcases the old-time Hollywood Technicolor at its very best. It's nice to see Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHaviland in their prime in a good old-fashioned swashbuckler. If you haven't seen it, make it a point to do so, if you don't own it, get it."
4,The original Hood,"Even though this movie from 1938 is in a 4 X 3 format rather than wide screen, it is still worth buying. The colors are very vivid and high definition makes it seem like your are there."
5,It Doesn't Get Any Better,"Like my title says, it doesn't get any better than this! Color like they must have in Heaven, and the truest good guy in all of movie folklore! Classic lines, classic swordplay, and Errol Flynn in his prime. Plus Basil Rathbone, who could also really fence (no stunt doubles here) and Claude Rains as the evil prince. I must have this movie memorized by now, line by line. If this comes out in DVD, it will be the all time greatest dvd release by far. ... Until then, get it on VHS, and you still won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent movie,"While some might not think so, I thought this movie was well done and is perfect for anyone who's faith says that homosexuality is a sin. The acting was good and the visual representation was good too, especially between the girl struggling to find her sexuality and her dog that died in the beginning of the movie."
5,"Unbelieveable, exotic, passionate","This movie was superb, I've seen it a thousand times and I don't get tired of watching it after so many years. I was hoping and struggling to bring camile back from the unknow. My only question that. I have asked on numerous occasiones ""when is this movie ever coming out on DVD!"""
5,Hot Hot Hot,"I loved this movie. It was refreshing to have a tale of two women falling in love that didn't end badly or deal with mental illness/perversion; espically fabulous looking women. The love scenes were realistic and well filmed. The cinematography was wonderful. It had, at times, a dreamlike quality and yet at other times it was like a ""telling"" photograph. The first love scene between Petra and Camille which is foiled by the women trapeze artists, was a sensual delight. A definite date-night movie, reserved for that special someone."
3,Review of When Night is Falling,"Although I wasn't blown away by this movie, it had a really sweet feel about it. This contains the age old scenario of a straight girl finding herself inexplicably attracted to an openly gay women. Add in a circus performer profession for the gay gal, and you can see the allure! In this movie girl beats boy in the affections for the female lead. All in all, not a bad night in."
4,Large dictionary,"I gave this 4 stars only because it is a very large and heavy dictionary. I purchased this one because it was recommended by the french teacher I had at that time. Although it's a good dictionary, it was not as useful to me because of the size, I would prefer a smaller one."
4,Good for beginners,"While this is not high or classic drama, I beleive that this book (and its predecessor) are good books for high school students new to acting and performance. Save for a few scenes, I would not recommend these for more advanced actors. They are good short scenes with which the high school student can relate. Additionally, there are good three person scenes included, which I have a hard time finding."
2,I love philosophy but this one was a bummer.,"I purchased this at a local store and since I absolutely love lime and lemon scents, I figured this was going to be very special. Unfortunately, my bottle has zero scent. It doesn't smell like anything at all. I really wish I had pulled the tab before purchase and smelled. It bubbles up just like all philosophy 3-in-1 gels and leaves you feeling soft and moisturized. There just is no scent and lets face it that is what draws most of us to the philosophy line is that great smell. All this being said, from the other reviews I gather I am in the minority and have to figure that the bottle I received was defective. Most of the time if I purchase a philosophy scent that I don't love I will pass it along to one of my daughters but this one I simply threw out."
2,Hardly worth the trouble,"Hardly worth the trouble, much less the price. Wholesale distribution is not the kind of business that the average person just decides to start out of the blue, like a maid service or tv repair shop. For some weird reason, this book treats WD just like that. The author assumes you know absolutely nothing about running a business and must be tutored on elementary details. The meat of the whole WD issue is hardly touched. The scope of the book is extremely limited, and other than a single obscure reference in the appendix, it was totally useless to me."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"A total Piece of Garbage, do not buy this at all.First of all it is battery operated which i did not know when i bought it. Secondly, when i went to put batteries in it, the terminals in side of it are offset, one is higher than the other, and the higher terminal was damaged. When i put the batteries in and put the cover on it did not work, the case was pushing the battery away from the terminal. It worked without the cover on but that doesnt do anyone any good if u cant prevent the batteries from falling out. The thing is rather loud too and cover is a piece of cheap plastic. The thing is a Piece of Garbae, DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!"
5,Cuts to the chase!,"Having to learn new versions of data manipulators can be a nightmare when your deadlines are gone before you're given a project -- this gem cuts to the chase! Without a lot of fanfare, tells you exactly what to do, with just enough pictures to let you know you're in the right place. It's filled in a lot of blanks, and I'm now ordering the Access 2000 version. Try it, you'll like it."
2,Confusing,"I thought I was buying a disk and it turns out to be some sort of on-line viewing experience. I have yet to watch my purchase of several months ago. When I get time and consider it important, I will sit down and try to ferret out the method for viewing the film. Maybe I will like it then."
1,Did not like,First of all I did not like the fact that before you saw the concert you saw alot of foreign junk--this dvd was made in the USA-------------why all the foreign junk----I am very proud to be an American and when I saw that junk it was an immediate turn off-------out comes the dvd and was sent back to the owner who gladly refunded me.
4,Elvis On Tour,"This is one of my favorite movies. Nothing compares to Elvis on stage. No annoying interviews, no scripts just Elvis doing what he did best, Singing live. Looking forward to a possible re-release in 2002."
1,Bad product,"We purchased 3 DVD's, but two of the 3 dvd's didn't work in our dvd players. We bought them for my father in-law to take home with him, but when he tried to watch them only 1 of the 3 worked. By the time we came back from vacation it was too late to return them. The dvd's had 2 different global regions of play."
2,Freddy's back and you'll run screaming,"Well, he doesn't belive it could be true. He moved into the house that belonged to dream therapist Nancy Thompson and is plagued by the same menacing nightmare man. This time, Freddy wants the young boy's body to accomplish mass mutilation via part 1. Not as good as the first (to be expected) and provides one or two good shocks the whole way. Hello, intensive care."
3,Fine Sequal,See it... if you notice there is no freddy theme music in this one..Allittle offbeat which gives it spice but well entertaining..
1,Freddy needed to haunt the director of this disaster,"HORRIBLE! That's the only word I can use to describe this sequel.After Wes Craven created a horrible monster in the original, Freddy is turned into a complete laughingstock here. We not only see Freddy's face, but he gets around to making cute cracks that just destroyed his wickedness.Nancy SHOULD have appeared here as it would have made more sense. Instead, we're left to relive her experiences through her diary that she left in a corner of her bedroom closet (that we were never told in the original she was keeping!).This sequel is a comedy (and an unfunny one at that!) not horror.Craven got on the ball and righted some wrongs in ""Dream Warriors."""
2,Freddy Returns... Too Bad the Scares Didn't,"Wes Craven's ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" is one of my favorite films of all time... It combines a campy/low budget feel with really creepy music, a manic and freakish villain and creative set pieces that immerse the viewer in their worst nightmare. It's really too bad that the only amazing thing about this sequel is Fred Kruger (played once again to chilling perfection by Robert Englund.) The main character is really hard to relate to, and he's not the best actor either! Lisa was a character I liked, and the ending was stellar and frightening... but only heightened my disappointment in the overall wastefulness of this film. (2 stars for Freddy, Lisa and the amazing score by Christopher Young.)"
3,'FREDDY'S REVENGE'!!!,"It has been five years since Nancy killed Freddy. Now, a new kid lives where Nancy lived. Jesse and his girlfriend, Lisa find Nancy's diary that talks about who Freddy is and how she killed him. Soon, Freddy is back and he needs Jesse's body to kill people again. Can Lisa stop Freddy and save Jesse? I thought Freddy at the pool party was pretty cool, and Freddy showing his brain to Jesse. If you love Freddy, you might like A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE!!!"
2,Breaks the Freddy Rules,"One good thing about this movie is the way Freddy looks. It might be a good movie if it wasnt N.O.E.S. 2. Its kind of like Halloween 3 is the black sheep to the other Halloweens. Its cool that Freddy was in it, but they broke the Freddy rules in this film; Freddy can come out and kill people without them being asleep??? I just have it because it came in the box set."
3,What the hell was this,"I am giving this movie 3 stars because of Robert Englunds excellent performance but the plot and story was dull. The first nightmare was highly succesfull but, why the hell did they call this nightmare on elm street there were barely any dreams. Overall good acting and special effects but the story needed to be more well developed. I reccomend the original nightmare on elm street as it is the scariest."
3,ehhh,This is not one of the better movies in the Nightmare on Elm Street series but is a must have for an fan of Freddy Krueger
3,"Not the worst, the fifth is...","I saw this film after the first one and thought that Freddy has abandoned his haunting way of killing and became a rather generic killing-machine.This is nowhere as good as the first one, but I prefer this over the really bad NOES 5.If you are not a completist, who wants to own all the NOES-films, buy this one and not the fifth."
3,Very hard to judge this one !!!,"I have only seen parts 1 and 2 so far, and part 1 was better by a mile. The soundtrack rocked, the characters were likable and the fatalaties were also cool. Also, in part 1 Freddy can only kill in someones dream /nightmare, but in part 2 he enters reality. Well, now that I got that out of the way, I think that part 2 is not a bad film if you disconnect yourself from the rules of Freddy. I found part 2 to be a darker film, though lacking the shocks, thrills and scares provided in part 1. There are a few cool moments in it and there are some very dodgy. But overall it isn't too bad to watch and is an interesting twist to the rules of the original. Another thing I like about it is that this is not as memorable as part 1 is, making the life span much greater, atleast for me. That's why I've given it 3 stars.Can't wait to watch part 3."
2,Could be better,Let's see---Freddy knocks off random people outside of dreamsHomoerotic subplot is subtle but apparent with the teen in thissequalNot really scary at allProbably suspense- not horror--I dont know- very weak review for a very weak sequal- skip 2and see Elm Street 3I never picked up on the gay undercurrent during the flickbut after reading others reviews- I guess its possible
3,its okay,"the 1st time i saw this i wanted to puke,,but after a few years i watched it again and it was ok, maybe it was because it was different or maybe i was really bord so im stuck between bad and okay.. someone help me"
5,No Scratches!!!,This dvd is a family favorite! I am very pleased that I was able to purchase this in such good condition and recieve it in such a timely manner!
4,"Both ""cute"" and dark","This is both a great and bad movie: What's bad? For some parts of the songs, there's too much ""empty"" wordless space and in some spots as well as too much crammed in some spots. Something that's good and bad: Having the original ending (where several Audrey II's take over the world) cut off, which would have made it depressing; yet more strong metaphorically (someone being persuaded by riches into destruction)."
2,RE-RELEASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN RE-DONE,"I already had the original release of ""Little Shop"" on dvd, but I recently bought the re-release expecting to see an improvement on picture quality. I had been anticipating and looking forward to seeing this masterpiece finally be perfected; unfortunately, I discovered the devastating fact that the image quality was still just as poor as the edition that was first released back in 1998. This reality caught me totally off guard since Warner Brothers has come such a long way in dvd quality, especially with the release of ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"". Don't get me wrong, but it is rather upsetting that Warner was able to do such a good job on the ""Pee-Wee"" dvd and still only do a so-so job to the visual quality on such a cult classic as this much-loved gem. Warner Bros., I shun and look down upon you. I am now out of 20 bucks and out of hope."
5,HYSTERICAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tho this isn't like the original (1960) which wasn't a comedy but for it's time a thriller (starring Jack Nicholson), this is one of the best remakes I've seen.Seymore and Audrey make this movie as well as the.This movie (as well as the 1960 version) is so cute, Seymore and Audrey really make the movie and keep it goin. I can see this movie being a classic. It's clean, it's fun, it's full of laughs for everyone."
5,Classic!,"I fell in love with this movie when I first saw it years ago, and now I have it as part of my DVD collection. It is an awesome movie, can watch over and over, and so worth the money!"
5,Love This Show!,A classic rendition of an amazingly funny and quirky musical. Steve Martin is perfect as the dentist! And Rick Moranis will always be Seymour in my mind.
4,Little Shop,"This is my eight-year-old's current all time favorite movie in the world. He (and I) particularly like Ellen Green (Audrey) and, of course, the giant person-eating talking plant is always a hit. Of note, this is a kinder, gentler version of the musical (and original movie), a change that I don't particularly care for. However, the ""happy"" ending may make some people more comfortable."
2,Little Shop of Horrors (Keep Case Packaging)Little Shop of Horrors (Keep Case Packaging),The case was smashed and - as far as I know - I didn't even order it! I accidentally got this broken CD in the mail.
4,Works great!,Good price. Works great. Easy to install. Would be five stars if a little bit wider. Overall very satisfied. Use it in a cabinet so the tv can slide out to provide access to dvd slot in the side.
4,"Straight Talk about ""STRAIGHT TALK""","I have adored this movie for years, mostly for Dolly's bubbly and loveable performance. The DVD release was lackluster, as it was only presented in full frame and had no extras.The Blu Ray still doesn't deliver any extras, but we finally have the film in the widescreen aspect ratio that it has always deserved. The picture quality is good (not perfect, but a vast improvement over the DVD version) with a bit of dirt but vivid colors and crisp closeups. Sound is a bit off at times, but overall is again an improvement over the DVD.I got this today at Target for a STEAL of a deal at $3.99!"
5,How Can You Go Wrong?,"This is Dolly doing what she does best - entertaining. The comedic lines and the fun she has in this movie are exceptional. It is an excellent movie that truly exemplifies some of her great, optimistic outlooks on life. It's a movie with Dolly Parton - it can't be bad."
2,Straight nonsense!,"Not Dolly's best and definitely not James Woods' best, who obviously needed some extra cash at the time. The pairing of Dolly and Woods makes no sense - it's hard enough to believe that they simultaneously act - but in the same movie? Also not to sound perverted but Dolly's characters are always the same - the cocky, wisecracking, yet down home and innocent cowgirl played out long ago. Straight Talk, unfortunately offers little laughs."
4,Raunchy!,"Good book. It arrived in good condition.These are stories, not just a couple of paragraphs of unexplained sex.But, yes there is lots of raunchy sex."
5,Best damn rock band of all time,"from the time the furs broke out in the late 70's to love spit love, these guys had a sound that no one today comes near. long live the furs"
3,electronic free jazz,"The lineup is Miles Davis on trumpet, Steve Grossman on sax, Chick Corea on electric piano, Dave Holland on bass guitar, Jack DeJohnette on drums, and Airto Moreira on percussion. The setlist is roughly the same as from the 1969 recordings Festiva de Juan Pins (Sony) and Paraphernalia (JMY) but with ring modulators, fuzz wah, Brazilian percussion the sound of the band is transformed. Highlights include Miles Runs the Voodoo Down and Wayne Shorter's Masqualero, but the playing is brilliant andabstract throughout. Columbia should release this 2-disc set as 1 CD, because the concert is exactly 80 minutes."
2,'Beauty'??,"This is, I must say, one of the few Miles albums from the early-mid 70s that really BORES me, and doesn't grow on me at all. Don't see why it was issued at all, seems like it was slapped together indifferently and packaged in a kitschy psychedelic gatefold jacket; I'm sure there's other stuff out there, including the complete Isle of Wight performance. And the sound is awful for an official release. It doesn't help any that the band is plugged in throughout the 80-minute set, and Chick Corea's electric piano sounds unbearably harsh and quite often at odds with the rest of the music. Same goes with Steve Grossman's dime-store Coltrane imitations. The hero here is drummer Jack DeJohnette, but it's near impossible to hear him over Corea's electronic mayhem. Really not worth the money, and the curious will likely be disappointed."
2,More dischord from jammaster Satan.,"hysterical virtuosity,fractured jazz. i think it was a bad-afro day in miles davis's universe on april 10, 1970. if you like it 'out there', get this. if you want to clear the room, get this. no tender musings here."
3,Too long...,"Well, I'm a huge Lee Smith fan, so I'm surprised to find myself giving only 3 start to one of her creations. But this one just didn't live up to what her readers have come to expect from her.I couldn't really get behind Crystal Spangler and her remoteness. It's clear to readers what her problem is from close to the beginning, but it takes the rest of the looooong book for Cristal herself to figure it out, and when she does, she just becomes more passive and decides to die.I gave up real interest in the outcome long before I came to the end.The one I'd have found more interesting was Agnes, her across-the-street friend, through whose eyes we see Crystal over the passage of years. She was a much stronger character than Crystal herself."
2,"well-written, but what's the point?","I waited in vain for Smith to reveal a reason why Crystal Spangler's life and troubles were important enough to dramatize. Smith writes well and creates a vivid milieu, but my overwhelming reaction was, ""So what?"" Crystal, despite the vast amounts of text devoted to her thoughts and feelings, remains essentially a non-entity and her troubled life contains no redemptive or cathartic aspect. It's an exercise in detailed, adequately-crafted pointlessness."
4,great book,john has proved himself as an excellent story teller. this book keeps the reader hooked until the last page. i would and will strongly recommend this book to everyone i know!
2,another experimental effort,"Bill Frisell. No question he has the chops. However, I must publicly admit that he has never produced a recording session that as a whole has truly moved me. Individual tracks - yes. But, a cd taken as a unified whole - no. When I compare this session to let's say Ella Fitzgerald Sings The Cole Porter Songbook - or, too put it bluntly, Ella to Petra Haden, I've got to laugh. Not that one should compare really fine mangoes, to let's say, starfruit, but face it, when it comes to recorded music, one choses what one wishes to hear. The session might have come off better, had it been 50% Frisell soloing. His brilliant solo rendition of ""When You Wish Upon A Star"", played on Marian McPartland's radio show, brought uncontrollable tears to my eyes - but not the version here."
4,A one-off jewel,"This is a unique item in Anton Fier's (and Golden Palomino's) discography. Doesn't resemble any other Palominos record, instead belongs to the same bag as early Jamaaladeen Tacuma records and James Blood Ulmer's harmolodic funk (esp. Music Revelations Ensemble CDs) and the more aggressive Bill Laswell projects. It's all about basses and drums attacking full force, creating a weirdly polyrythmic funk-rock groove, on top of which disturbing effects and noise float.Very good."
5,Great movie!,"Elvis had about three or four good movies of all those he made. As most fans know, the later movies became very formulaic, and are sometimes embarrassing to watch Elvis being forced to degrade himself in such a way because Colonel Parker had roped him into a terrible contract. Jailhouse Rock is one of the great ones--Elvis demonstrates a promise of acting ability...his character is multi-dimensional, as opposed to later films where he was always the good guy, always got the girl, and always sang on cue. He has a rebellious vulnerability in his first few films that is similar to James Dean. (as much as I love Elvis, he was no James Dean--just saying his first few films showed promise similar to that of James Dean) Great film. A standout for this era."

3,Budo,"It's got some interesting takes on Aikido, and some really good photos of O Sensei, but I felt that it wasn't put together cogently, or at least enough to keep my attention. If you like Aikido, I would recommend getting 'the art of peace' before I would recommend this work."
1,The Sixth Fleet,"A disappointing book, written in episodic format, with an unsatisfying ending. The story line is potentially a good one and the writter clearly knows his subject. Unfortunately, the book is burdened with too many, poorly developed characters. Who is the hero? None of the characters are drawn completely enough to make that determination. Once we get interested in a character, he dissapears or is religated to a minor background role. The book does not stand on its own and is obviously intended to be part of a series. The non-ending just appears and the reader must buy the next installment to see what happens. I for one am not biting."
5,The Sixth Fleet,"The Sixth Fleet is an excellent book. It has great descriptions and great story telling by the author. It shows what can happen to the U.S. and its military if we do not maintain a strong military posture through the world. It give the you a feel for the interworking of the U.S. Military including the good and the not so good. David E. Meadows has been there and has done that, he has been stationed at the Pentagon, and Joint Chiefs of Staff and knows the interworking of the Beltway, this has translated well into this great story. If you only read one novel this year, I most strongly recommend ""The Sixth Fleet."""
1,Lasted 5 minutes,"Received product yesterday and tried this evening. Very simple to use, just plug in and follow hair growth. In fact this product worked great FOR 5 MINUTES, than the speed slowed down to a crawl and it gradually sputtered out. When I unplugged it I noticed the plug had become red hot.Went from box to garbage in one night. I don't know if I just got a lemon or if its just a cheap product.To bad cause its a good idea."
2,Disappointing,"After having enjoyed Michael Zell's book on Rembrandt and the Jews, I looked forward to the release of Nadler's publication. While Rembrandt's Jews is well-written and at times touching, I found it to be a pastiche of other books I have read on Dutch Jewry. What Nadler has done, albeit in an engaging way, is combine other scholars' ideas about Dutch tolerance of the Jews and Jewish life in seventeeth-century Holland (Yosef Kaplan and Miriam Bodian, for example), while throwing in a few works of art for illustration."
4,Light Reading,"Very interesting book; fast reading. Strays from the subject at the end. Casual touch of tourist viewpoint fits in with the general mood. It referred me to Schama's The Embarrassment of Riches, which was HEAVY."
5,Readable and Entertaining History,"Part Art History, part Jewish history, and with beautiful illustrations, this book tells the story of the Jews who were expelled from the Catholic countries of Southern Europe, and how they were fortunate to find a home in Holland for the 400 years up until the Nazis. Rembrandt did quite a few Old Testament paintings and had Jewish neighbors and patrons, thus the connection. This is more a Jewish history than a Rembrandt biography."
3,Just another...,"...ho-hum collection. This one actually bored me before it finished. If you absolutely are a TYA freak, get it. Otherwise....."
3,Lucas needs a better editor,"I am amazed that only 2 readers out of 68 reviewers mentioned the fact that the same telephone conversation occurs in this book within 9 pages. I read fast and I read alot--but it was hard to miss. Not only did it confuse the story line, but it removed a level of trust in the integrity of the author and publisher. Who is editing these books????I like the character of Lucas Davenport, I enjoy his humor and taste for the finer things--so it was fun to read--but c'mon--this should not happen."
3,"""Just OK""","I'd rate this the second weakest effort in the ""Prey"" series after ""Shadow Prey"", but it's still a pretty-good overall read.(SPOILER) I have to say I was disappointed in seeing Clara Rinker getting killed off since she was one of the more interesting characters in the two books she's been in. Also, the book was missing some of the other ""background"" characters that usually keep me riveted to the book."
2,Disappointing,"In all the other ""Prey"" novels, parts of Lucas Davenport's character have been revealed. I didn't feel this was at all true of ""Mortal Prey."" Davenport seems to be just a character in anyone's book - smart, but nothing new."
3,"""Prayed For An Ending""","Lucas Davenport ran a good investigation in this story with the return of Clara Rinker, former hitwoman for the Mafia. The FBI should have stayed home. These stories are much better when Lucas is on his own turf. The story really dragged through the middle with a terrible ending. Clara was a clever and smooth operative throughout and as one cop said, ""She should work for the CIA"". I could not believe Clara would be so careless in the ending; I was very dissappointed.I gave it three stars because the FBI was one star, Lucas was three stars, and Clara was five stars."
1,It is the worst thing a teacher can have,"My teacher uses it into my class, and this had cost us: 6 month of school-year lost, 7 million of I- spent without any cause, except her hobbies (psychology). And then, I've been told I'll never be able to be happy, find a job, and other incredible things I don't say just because my english don't know them. What to say.....Goleman wasn't a great man, at all."
3,Emotional Intelligence,"This is common misinterpretation of emotions as some extra for thinking.What our brain does is generation of current emotional state.We are calling as thinking only partial explanations of these states.Intelligence is ability to represent.System, which behavior based on its own representation is cognitive.World is given to as by representation, and only experience is link between real world and our representation about it.This is real base to evaluate these kind of booksM. Zeldich"
1,C.O.D.,"Don't you just get the feeling in some of the reviews that Daniel Goleman and friends write to leave an occasional butterscotch taste in your mouth.I live outside of the States and although I've heard many references to this book, I didn't decide to buy it until today. I normally don't like these kinds of books but want to see what it's about. Somehow I don't feel sure of my purchase after reading reviews and feel like returning the book. I probably won't but I have to say that I hope that it's better than the reviews that I've just read. Myself being a free thinker with no real interest in popular opinion hope to find ideas that could help in social situations without condemning people that don't want to just snugly fit into society but still want to be effective in their daily lives."
1,Terrible,"This book is very bad. The book is here to make money. I'll tell you what this book is about. It's so the stupid people who fail classes, can't think, have the vocabularies of six year olds, can feel better. Plain and simple. It's so the dumb frat boys and sorority chicks who have no brains can boast about their high EQs."
1,Avoid the paperback edition,"I've just received the 10th Anniversary paperback edition and am VERY disappointed. The poor quality of this book is inexcusable.1) The paper seems to be the cheapest possible grade (think 40's wartime grade).2) The binding is awful. The inner text is bound so closely to the spine, you have to bend the spine backwards on many pages just to read it.3) Ink quality/darkness varies throughout my copy.3) Figure on page 19: The caption and first sentence is missing (as I found out after checking someone else's version of the book).All in all, if I were the author I'd be disgusted with Bantam for this edition."
4,"If you can recognize your own emotions, this will only reaffirm what you already know.","There are three things to clarify for this review:1) I wanted to read this to gain some perspective on dealing with a boss who I assume has a low emotional intelligence2) I instantly found what I was looking for3) I also discovered I already knew the answerI think #3 indicates why the book exists. Looking through reviews of this book (not just on Amazon) I see a lot of reviews that indicate readers want to learn how to be more emotionally sensitive. To me, that isn't possible. It is the equivalent of reading books on how to be a genius in order to become a genius.For those that have an emotional backbone, you'll likely find yourself reading this thinking ""Yes! Duh!"". At the very least it will reaffirm for you that you are not alone and somebody understands where you are coming from. In the meantime, my boss is still a robot trying to mimic emotion and I am an employee doing my best to not get angry at him for it."
1,totally useless book...read hill's PMA book,It's funny reading all these books by professors/academics that are now catching up to what has been written in many self-help books for the last fourty or fifty year.Goleman and Seligman seem to make Emotional Intelligence and Learned optimism as some kind of great discovery...when all it is just plain common sense and rehashed works of Napoleon Hill and other self-help guru's.I would dare anyone to read this book and read Napoleon Hill's Success with a positive mental attitude and see which they find more useful.
4,Four and a half stars,"This book was in excellent condition, though it was slower than anticipated in arriving...ie it was a couple of days outside the date range quoted for delivery."
4,So much good information,"Alot of great information of how our emotions work and how they work to help and hurt us in our everyday life.My only complaint about this book is he tries to give too much advice in too many areas (relationships, work, schools, etc). I also think he talks way too much about why it's important to be Emotionally Intelligent instead of HOW to actually do it."
2,"Full of horror stories, monotonic, bold statement","i was very exited to get a book, but after the first few pages it became impossible to read.... father shot the kid... bugler killed girls with soda can... i guess Coleman could find anther stories to demonstrate emotions.... lot of statements have not baked by any scientific facts...spiritual side of emotions ignored completely... I bet that Coleman is an warrior atheist:))"
4,Better than I expected,"I'm not sure what I was expecting out of this book but it was more than that. I don't read a lot of selfimprovement books or psychology stuff. I did read this and I found it really interresting. I've found it has helped the way I think about my children, co workers, and husband. I've really enjoyed it."
4,Emotional intelligence,Excellent book that really explains empathy and how is not only a good thing to do but a pratical thing. This is definetly a book that everyone should read. It helps in personal life and business.
2,If you like Doctor Phil than this is your book.,"Full of horror stories and modern psycho-babble, if it weren't for the hard neuroscience in the first few chapters, this book would only have been worth 1 star. I can only imagine that the readers who gave this book positive reviews were were so hard up for advice that literally anything positive they came across would have had a positive effect. Good for them. However as someone who was looking for a better understanding of human emotions through science, I found most of the content of this work cliche and generally useless. If you want to hear about a rainbow, ask an artist not a scientist."
5,who wouldn't,To me this is a must have in everyone's audio library. His songs have been a part of my life since childhood and brings me back home in an instant.
5,Great Album,Great songs. Always liked the Wailers but first time really listening to them. Multiple versions of some songs but still a must have.
5,"Bob Marley, great songs & lyrics.","I enjoyed the songs, and of course the upgrades the songs and the sounds . Good classic album to be enjoy and relax the time away."
1,Does NOT Fit,This doesn't fit my 2003 Jaguar S-type even though they say it should. I tried to put it in too late to get a refund. Beware.
2,Aluminum base buckled quickly,"I bought this pot to brew beer, so I use a lot of heat for long boils. I use a flat, ceramic top stove. On the second use, the base of the pot warped (bubbled on the bottom, outer side). It seems the aluminum core separated from the stainless coating, so now the pot will not sit level on the stove; it wobbles. This greatly reduces efficiency of heat transfer, since conduction requires contact. The pot would work fine over a gas flame, but I do not have a gas stove. So the options are buy another pot, or buy a butane stove. This product is not a good investment if you are looking for a cheaper stainless pot as I was."
4,No Orange Color On My Fingers,"I do love the original Cheetos Cheese Puffs, but not the fact my fingers end up covered with the orange-colored coating on the puffs. I have eaten several bags of Barbara's Bakery Gaked White Cheddar Cheese Puffs and was disappointed at not being able to detect white cheddar but the puffs are very light with a pleasant flavor. They have a light crispy crunch to them and can be eaten without a beverage as they do not seem dry to my mouth. It would be difficult to eat just a small quantity of them, but I found them to be a delicious, non-filling snack as well as being healthier than the fried kind. I will certainly order them again in the future."
4,Daughter loves it,"My daughter is learning Spanish in 2nd grade, and she loves this album. We listen to it in the car all the time now. It would be nice to have the words to the songs."
1,Average,"I bought this CD when I heard her sing the theme song from the TV series Gilmore Girls with Carole King, her mother, good reviews as well, this album has no real direction, it wants to sound like a cross between Jazz and Indie, it just does not work, no song on the album stood out, listen to it twice in a row, I just could not get myself to like it, her voice is good, the materiel is just not up to it, the lyrics just don't blend, at first hearing it starts out much like the group IVY, though not even close to the excellent music they perform, sorry a waste of money."
2,Why should I pay more for the Kindle copy than for the book,"When the physical book price is less than the Kindle price, there is no justification for downloading the book into a kindle."
5,Fascinating Reading,"This book makes fascinating reading, even for the non-scientist and non X-File fan. Personally, my last forays into science were sometime in the tenth grade, and I've only seen the X-Files show sporadically. But Professor Simon explains the scientific rationale behind the episodes in such an entertaining and illuminating manner, I never missed a beat. She is a thoroughly competent scientist, but I think it's her excellent storytelling ability that sets this work apart. As someone who's tried to struggle through a number of ""science for laypeople"" books and put them down unfinished, I would recommend this book as a very entertaining read."
2,Missing WAY too much,"I am giving this compilation two stars because it was the album that got me into Priest. There are so many great songs missing from here, it really should have been a two disc set. First off, including a live version of Victim of Changes was a stupid idea. I like the studio version much better. Second, I don't know how the could make a compilation without ""Beyond the Realms of Death"". That is one of their best songs. Here are some great songs not included on the compilation -1. Beyond the Realms of Death2. Exciter3. Stained Class4. The Ripper5. Dreamer Deceiver6. Island of Domination7. Sinner8. Hell Bent for Leather9. United10. Metal Gods11. Rapid Fire12. Screaming for Vengeance13. Painkiller14. A Touch of Evil15. Night Crawler16. Between the Hammer and the Anvil17. Hell Patrol18. All Guns Blazing19. One Shot at Glory20. Rocka Rolla""Metal Meltdown"" is a good song, but I don't see why they picked it instead of ""Painkiller"" or ""A Touch of Evil""."
1,Don't buy it.,"Judas Priest is, indeed, one of the greatest Heavy Metal bands of all time. But you wouldn't know it by this terrible compilation CD. It's not terrible because the songs are bad, but rather, because they're only the POPULAR Judas Priest songs, not the GOOD Judas Priest songs. ""Hot Rockin'"" was one of the worst songs off of ""Point of Entry"", and ""Breaking the Law"" certainly isn't the best. Better Priest songs are ""Painkiller"", ""Blood Red Skies"", ""The Sentinel"", so on and so forth. Not only that, but I'm not sure if this is even an Official Judas Priest license (if it were, it would appear in their discography, which it does not). Consdering the cost of Judas Priest (remasters) these days, which is about $12, you're better off buying ""Screaming for Vengeance"", ""Defenders of the Faith"" or ""Painkiller"" as opposed to this. I think that Judas Priest has a lot more good work than what's here - especially from the ""Sad Wings of Destiny"" album."
3,Too Short!!!,"Forget this skimpy set and buy ""Sad Wings Of Destiny"", ""Screaming For Vengeance"", and ""Painkiller"", their three best albums!! 9-24-07 The two-disc ""Essential Judas Priest"" has come out since I wrote this, and is the best bet for JP compilations."
5,Simply Amazing!,"I must admit that I am magnetically drawn to this recording. It is very, very difficult to listen to, but so honest in its display of emotion that you'll listen again and again. Although Holiday's voice is beyond totally destroyed, her artistry is simply at its peak. I can feel her pain, her life, in every lyric, every phrase. I especially enjoy, sacriligiouly, ""For Heaven's Sake"" and ""End of a Love Affair"". It's amazing to note that without any technical skills left in her voice, the true nature of her singing, her music comes through. She's just emoting on record- highly, highly reccommended."
3,I get it - but don't want to,"Yes...I understand what previous reviewers are feeling and saying, viv-a-vis the haunting, scarred, weak voice of Billie on this, set against the lush arrangements of Ray Ellis. ""You've Changed"" was described by one as being haunting ""like a car accident"". I agree. I am also a lover of jazz instrumentalists (and Billie's voice certainly sounds like an instrument) with strings and good arrangements. All that being said, I simply do not think that this one is a ""good"" one. Music should lift one's soul as well as nourish it. I think that Billie's later Verve recordings stretched the limits of that description enough. I feel that this one crosses that line. I love 99% of Billie Holiday's music - I just can't listen to this one. 3 stars simply because of what all of the other reviewers said. This recording, to me, is almost morbid in its appeal."
2,not her best,I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this.
5,...lord have mercy!!!...,"...these reviewer folks is right: this is a haunting, voyeuristic and reckless-eyeballin view into the soul of a hurt woman. i have owned this cd for about a year and i have been very reluctant to play it...not out of dis-interest, but out of reverence and respect....feel like i done peeped into somebody's diary and discovered they dirty lil' secrets...very touching...this aint to say that you shouldnt get this, but it helps if you are a deep-souled person yourself...very mature and understanding...(i barely qualify!!)...for those of yall who are meshell n'degeocello fans, lissen to her 'bitter' album and then imagine if she was REALLY, REALLY brokenhearted!!! - this might be what you get...."
5,Plasma cars,"These cars were ordered for a Christmas gift after observing a similar car left from years ago that grandsons were having a ball riding. We have heard even the mom and dad of the grandsons have been on them having fun as well (of course they are within the weight limit advised). These cars are different from the normal bikes and riding toys. Very sturdy. A ""toy""to get them out of the house and doing something physical that is fun."
2,Not for all kids,"After reading the rave reviews this riding toy recieved, I thought my grandson should have one for his 5th birthday. I have to say we were all disappointed with the results. My grandson was frusterated with wiggling the handle so much, he is very active in sports etc but I guess he needed more 'instant gratification' as he grew bored quickly. It might have helped if the road out front of his house were a bit smoother. It seems that the bumpier the surface, the more difficult the maneuvering to get it to move faster than a slow walk. Sorry, but kids just don't flock to this like other reviews indicated."
3,Better for older kids,We bought this for my daughter right before she turned two. She was too small for it. She is now three and still can't operate it like it is supposed to be operated. She puts her feet down and scoots it that way (her friends do this too when they visit). I however have had a good time riding on it! And my daughter likes to ride with me. You can ride up to 200 lbs. on it so hopefully it will become a more interesting toy as she gets older and more coordinated.
5,Best buy on this unique vehicle,I bought this for my grandchild for Christmas and I can hardly wait for him to ride it. He'll be 2 1/2 at Christmas so I'm hoping he will be able to handle it. The price was right and I checked reviews so I am very pleased with my bargain.
5,Big Hit!,"We gave this plasma car to my 3 year old grandson for Christmas and he loved it! He would open other gifts but kept going back to the car. It was too snowy for him to ride outside today, but he was content to ride it around the house and he had a ball! I would definately recommend this toy!"
2,Buy it for the pictures,"Nick Bantock does not refer to himself as much a writer as a creative artist. This is reflected in the Capolan set.The art is excellent and pure Bantock: colorful, expressive, off-center, collage-ish. The book is not good, though. The book tries to be pure Bantock - that is, meditiative, somewhat sad but fulfilled, and quietly anti-commercialist. However, it tries too hard. Artists agree that art should make the unfamiliar familiar, or the familiar unfamiliar. I believe Griffin and Sabine made Bantock's unfamiliar concepts familiar because of the familiar root - correspondence - combined with the rich, concrete detail rooted in basic human emotions. Capolan fails, though. Although the concept of a nomad nation is known to westerners, it is not familiar, and it is not made familiar since there are few rich, familiar details. Unless you are a Bantock devotee or an art lover, skip this one over."
3,No Quality Control,"I picked up this film used after seeing this formerly advertised here new for $17.98. I'm a Peter Weir fan mostly of his Oz period, which I still consider this film. I don't remember from seeing this at a theatre years ago if this DVD has been edited, but the print except for a few blemishes looks good. However-- ignoring the package information-- this film has NOT been transferred with a stereo soundtrack. At least my copy is MONO. PS- where's a widescreen release of ""Fearless""???"
4,Best movie I've seen that takes place in Indonesia,"How many movies are made about Indonesia? This one is so literally steamy and hot, you'll need a shower afterward. Linda Hunt deserved her Academy Award nomination. Shadow puppets add exotic Indonesian flavor. Passionate, tense romance, and subtle (by today's standards), you-are-there action. Also depicts a view of little-remembered effects of Ugly American anti-Communist policies in the 1960s."
2,"Great film, poor DVD","The film is great, the DVD completely outdated and the film in desperate need of a new HD transfer. Hopefully soon on HD disc. This transfer is 90s garbage. Not much better than VHS."
2,The Year of Living Dangerously,This DVD gets stuck on scene 7 and will remain frozen in place. You can watch the beginning of the movie and/or scene 10 and after.Michael Wayne
2,Where the Red Fern Grows,"I ordered the dvd and, upon receving it, played it on my dvd player. There was a flaw in the disc, and the movie stopped playing when the flaw was reached. I contacted Amazon, and they promptly sent me a replacement. On playing the second dvd, it had the same flaw and stopped in exactly the same place. I have kept the dvd and skip over the flaw (about one minute of the movie)just before I get to the problem. I believe the problem will probably pop up on future copies so I decided to work around the flaw rather go through the hassle with a third copy.I'm a school teacher and needed to play the movie after reading the book. I'm just going to explain the problem to my students when I show it."
1,Where the Red Fern Grows,"Our seventh grade just read Where The Red Fern Grows. It was the best book ever and the rest of my friends think so too. It just became our new favorite book and then our teacher, Mr. Cutlip, asked us if we wanted to watch the movie. We said yes -- we were so excited and when we first starting watching it we were so excited but the more we watched it, the more we did not like it. We got so mad at it because it was leaving some real good parts out because the book was just so good we all figured the move was going to be real good. We all were wanting to know if you could go back and remake the movie all over BUT this time make it as close to the book as you can -- then you will have the best book and movie ever. And trust me everybody would buy it -- I would be the first one to buy it because your book is so good my mom is going to buy the book for me and there is not one book that I liked to read until now and it is Where The Red Fern Grows."
3,Red Fern Movie Review,"This movie was not at all what I expected. I expected to see a tragic epic of love, devotion, and death. Instead, I got a mix of corny acting and horrible action sequences. Rubin's death seemed deliberate and the scene with the mountain lion was over way too fast.They also cut out over half of the championship coon hunt, including the part when Billy almost loses his dogs to the blizzard. In short, if you are looking for a good reproduction of a classic children's book, don't watch this movie."
4,Dark and Deeply Gloomy,"Just the first 50 pages alone are enough to cast someone into a depression. This, one would think is a bad thing, but was a great way to pull the reader in. What possibly more could happen to this young Londoner Mary Saunders? The author deftly wrote scenes and descriptions to give the feeling around the characters and places. I could very vivdly see the cellar apartment Mary lives in, the clothes they wore, her mother's horrible attitude.In the following sections of the novel, we find out what happens to Mary in the streets of London. At first Mary is repelled, but soon finds some comfort in being ""a girl of her own liberty"" along side her new friend Doll. I felt some pity for Mary, as well as hoping she'd pull through, but as the novel went on, her motivations seemed more and more superficial. The girl was a pure teenager: a clothes horse!This book is a must read."
5,slammerkin,"very good, got what i expected and was pleased with the whole transaction. would order from them again & again"
2,Overrated,"I read an inordinate amount of historical fiction, and although Slammerkin is well researched (I read a David Liss novel which took place in the same period in the same place right after Slammerkin and felt like I was revisiting a familiar neighborhood), I didn't like it. First off, the narrator seems to be channeling a sex-crazed adolescent boy -- a silly attitude toward sex pervades. . . though the sex in the novel, from the heroine's perspective, remains very cold. In addition to the strangely immature treatment of sex, the characters in this novel do not ring true to me. There are too many disappointingly obvious archetypes. And the ending, to me, does not fit the character of the ""heroine"" we had come to know. Donoghue created a character who, despite some of the limitations of the story, became her own person. . . it was a mistake to force the character Donoghue created into the historical actions of the girl who inspired that character."
2,I hope you have a strong stomach...,The book started out interesting but after a while just became depressing. This has to be the most dark and disturbing book I have ever read.
5,Very Dark and Sad,"I read some very favorable reviews of Slammerkin and decided to give it a try. It was SO very dark even from the first page. You really can't help but end up rooting for poor Mary Saunders. How easily she goes from schoolgirl to prostitute is alarming, but let's remeber the time frame. The novel is VERY graphic and is not for the prissy or squimish. That said, the writing is very honest and up front. How else does one write about prostitution in the 1764 England? I applaud the author, how she took a small bit of history and totally fleshed it out and made it very believable. It was a slow read, there was so much to absorb. However, the characters stayed with me for days after. They were so vividly drawn. I loved the Whore with a heart of gold, Doll. I also felt for Mrs. Jones, and was shocked by her fate at the hands of Mary. This is not a fun beach read, this is dark and brutally honest and very frank in it's telling. I enjoyed it very much and highly recommend it!"
5,Outstanding Book!!!,"Wow...is about all I can say. This book has it all. It grabs you right at the begining and after that I couldn't put it down. I laughed, I cried and just when I thought I had things figured out wham CL takes you on another ride full of twists and turns. I highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys a wonderful mystery that has it all!!"
4,A Good Introduction,"I had been trying to locate an edition of Chatterton's poems for quite awhile. This seems to be the only edition in print as of now, and though it is a relatively scant volume, I suppose it will suffice. It features a thorough biographical introduction, as well as explanatory notes. Essential for Romantic scholars and enthusiasts, but be aware of what you are ordering before you pay more than the cover price."
1,Not even close to the previous seasons,"Sorry folks, but this one drags on for no good reason. Having watched it once i would never do so again. I have been a big fan of the andromeda series and enjoyed many of the episodes. There are simply too few episodes of any worth in season 5 and so it came to an end. What a sad finish to what could have been a much greater series. Watch farscape if you need a long running decent sci-fi. I hate to bag something unless necessary but it is that way here. Take care."
3,Fits the pan...handle wont tighten and falls off.,If I want to use it with my lumberjack pan I will first need to get a new handle. The screw will not secure to the handle. Cheaply made handle. I will buy a sturdier handle from a different manufacturer.
3,miles davis at fillmore,"They got the Prince of Darkness to play Fillmore East in June 1970. Here's what he played. Not all of it; four nights of music were edited down into four half-hour excerpts which shift from razor's -edge jazz weirdness to the scabrous stew Miles Davis kept on the bonfire until his retirement in late 1975. Which is to say that this music has something for everybody, except for ""music fans"" who like ""flow"" and ""continuity"". Tough luck, my friends, you get neither, and lots of bizarre tape splices to boot. If you want to hear the group go at it sans mutilation seek out Black Beauty: Miles Davis Live at Fillmore West. Dig my review for that title; it's a work of genius. Finally, if you get a rush out of good old rock and roll bombast, check out the dinosaur hollers at the end of each set. Nobody sold out quite like Miles Davis..."
2,Too tiny,I bought this for my daughter but she did not get to wear it at all. The hoops are so tiny and the lock is so cumbersome that I could not even put it on her. I had to return them.
3,"Very Fine Brahms, but an Oft Dirge-like Schumann Carnaval","Michelangeli remains to this day a frustrating pianist. Here he can be heard in a good performance of Brahms' showy Paganini Variations. But, perverse as always, he mixes up the order! But why EMI chose to attach this fine performance to such dreadful Schumann amazes me. At times Michelangeli all but comes to a halt in some of the Carnaval episodes; for perfectly straightforward music the great pianist choses to adopt the most perverse slow motion. What this has to do with the music escapes me. The three Album pieces don't fare any better.A perfect example of why everyone should be skeptical of these pumped-up titles, such as Recordings of the Century! Hit and miss doesn't begin to decribe what we have here - more like Beauty and the Beast!If you want the Brahms then go ahead - just don't even consider buying this for the Schumann."
1,Read: Mawdudi; John Esposito; Ismail Faruqi,"The author is trying to show readers his ""journey"" from Sunnism falsehood into Shiism ""truth"". In doing that he attempts to discredit everything of importance to Sunni Muslims; afterall this is his journey.I have this book in its original form in Arabic and I have several other books by the same author."
1,Disheartening,"It is disheartening to read such a book which can only be classified as sectarian propopaganda at the same time when many enlightened religious authorities (Both Shiite & Sunni)are continuously emphasizing that history is history and God is the One who is going to judge. I am greatly discouraged by the tone of the book and the methodolgy which can be summarized as follows: ""I know best; I am right; I know what really happened 1400 years ago(I was there!!); You all are wrong; I am right; Stop thinking; Follow me"". At this time and age when we are facing such great challenges, we deserve a better book and a better guidance."
5,"Sunni or Shia, What is the truth?","After departure of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam (PBUH), Islamic community divided in two main parts, Sunni and Shia. In spite of many common believes and similarities that these two groups have, there are some differences between them about the concept of Imam in Islam.Dr. Muhammad Tijani Samavi has investigated seriously some of the differences between Shia and Sunni and hence has valuable knowledge in this regard. In his book, 'Then I was guided', he has discussed fluently his understanding of Sunni-Shia differences."
3,Very Irish,"I guess this is a treatise on Irishness, with only the barest hint of science fiction (it is set very much in the here and recent past). Not being an expert on the Irish I can say nothing on the veracity of the characterisation, but it looks very convincing. It brings to light the various aspects of the Irish soul (Ireland being a modern state but also the land where the catholic faith permeates social life but, even after centuries, cannot touch the core of the green land where the fairies still live, if you see what I mean?)"
3,Thought-provoking but not a page turner,"The premise of the book (a virus that kills only women and targeted at specific countries) is interesting and the book itself is full of thought-provoking comments about revenge, social interaction, xenophobia, the power of science, and the role of religion.There was also a lot of focus on the plight and anger of the Irish at the British and, before them, the Romans. I certainly would have gotten more from this aspect if I knew more about Irish history or had Irish in my ancestry._Dune_ and the books that followed it were much more engrossing. Herbert, in this rare foray into ""contemporary"" literature, is thorough as always in his analysis of the workings of society and relationships among people.There's no doubt that it's a well-written book, but it was definitely a book where I was ok missing a day of reading it. Definitely not light ""summer"" reading but at the end of the day it's worth the read."
2,Good Start Soon Becomes Laborious,"I am not a huge fan of science fiction but I do enjoy post-apocalyptic story lines. So the overview, reviews, and book jacket sold me that this work from Herbert could be an interesting and entertaining romp. And indeed, it did start out that way with an engaging setup for the book involving the IRA, a scientist and his family, and the question of terrorism which unfortunately remains an important part of our lives. However, the book soon devolved into one part Crichton pseudo science, one part religious/moral debate, and one small part action and entertainment. Not that any of these ingredients are bad - it is just that they are poorly executed and the flow of the book is brutally challenging. I stuck with it hoping it would pick up and that my efforts would pay off. Unfortunately, my stubbornness would not allow me to give up and by the end I remained unrewarded."
5,The most amazing product,"Cannon 430EX Speedlite Flash is a great addition to your Rebel Xti. This flash makes all the difference in the world to the clarity of your photos. I am an amature, but, I have taken pictures that look professional with this flash and my Rebel Xti. If you love photography you can't go wrong with the investment in a Rebel XTi and the Canon 430EX flash system."
5,Very nice piece,"No big complaints. Got what it was described as. Have it hanging on the wall, looks great."
4,Coastal PeCollart,"Very good collar. One concern, my dog was able to slip out of it. Buyer must make certain collar fits tight."
3,"okay, but not as good as the original","i guess i didn't look carefully enough at the description, but this was the ""light"" version and i had to use much more to equal the regular agave."
3,It wasn't raw,"I am used to ordering a large 2 pack of raw agave, but since it is (or was) not available, I ordered this. It is just regular organic agave, not the raw stuff. It still tastes great, but I recently read that if agave is heated over a certain temperature it can be as bad for you as HF corn syrup. Because of this I am rating it a 3...I thought it would be raw."
3,Actually tried it,"I actually tried the techniques in this book while taking freshman physics at Harvard. They weren't all that helpful. I remember it sounding good, but being fairly useless when it came to attacking challenging textbook and recitation problems (which are a far cry from actual scientific questions). What I eventually learned was that the key to such so-called ""problems"" is to understand the problem writers and the choices they make. Polya operates in some idealistic and trivial world, as if being methodical were sufficient to win that game. People who find this book helpful may feel unprepared when they step it up a notch."
5,LONG LIVE POLYA!,"i must say that this is one of the most interesting books i've ever read. it is a must for teachers of mathematics and the sciences. polya exposes with an unmatched wit and cunning the art of breaking it down and analyzing parts of parts in order to arrive at a reliable and justifiable solution.polya is the quintessential teacher and this teacher finds his writings both compelling as well as inspiring. this is NOT the last book by this great mathematician that i plan to read.a word of advice for teachers: read it and REREAD it until you get the point. the teaching of mathematics is not a mere monkey-see-monkey-do regurgitation process. rather, it is the art of conveying to the student the problem-solving process. once the student has mastered this talent, the sky's the limit. and speaking of limits, the sky may just be a gross underexaggeration.LOVE IT! got to say again, ""BUY THE BOOK!"" and this goes doubly for TEACHERS!"
1,SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK,"TO MAKE THE ITEM WORK YOU HAVE TO ACTIVATE IT WITH THE INFOSEEK COMPANY . CALLED THE COMPANY , THEY SAID THIS SOFTWARE CANNOT BE ACTIVATED BECAUSE IT WAS SOLD ILLEGALY AND WAS INTENDED TO BE USED BY ONE CUSTOMER ONLY DURING THE YEAR 2002."
5,"""Gigi"" Vocal Selection- Music, Book and Lyrics.","The music, book and lyrics on The musical ""Gigi"" was complete and satifactory as I had expected. I was pleased with my purchase and the very prompt delivery."
1,"not for me, or the web?","Some of the strategies the author suggests are interesting. I was a beginner when I got this book, but I don't think I'll ever write PERL like this though. Seems like they could have published this book in a HTML book as an appendix...really more useful for folks who want to stick to HTML."
3,It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing!,"Sketches of Spain is an impressive work because it melds jazz and spanish classical composition but frankly I think it's a bit boring while other miles davis records are definitely more entertaining. I mean, jazz should be based on improvisation, shouldn't it? so why mix it with classical music which has very little to do with improvisation? the two genres are incompatible or at least they SOUND incompatible here. All in all, this is the only Miles Davis' record I wish I hadn't bought: I put it in the player, listened to it once, said ""wow"" (because obviously Davis & Evans are tremendously skilled) and never picked it up again. Maybe that's just because I'm a great fan of hard bop which has a more ""swinging"" mood but as Duke Ellington said, however inpressive it is, it doesn't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing. Sadly I see no swing here."
2,"Slow, sad and boring","Don't get me wrong!. This is not bad music at all. In fact, one of the things I like of Miles Davis is his ability on always looking ahead and trying something different. And he tried many things. And mostly he succeed. But although many people like this record I just don't happen to understand it. But I can't deny the effect of this record on me: It bores me. Like most of classical music. I just don't get it!."
3,Sketches of Spain.,"I remember this music from 30 years ago, but this particular rendition is different from what I remember. I was not particularly pleased with it.If you like Jazz, Sketches of Spain is magnificent, but I think there is a truer form of Miles Davis rendition than this one."
5,You must have it,"If you do not own this album, your collection is not complete. This album defines sheer musical beauty."
4,Paris in a Basket,The photography is beautiful and the content is very informative and well written. I would like to visit the markets in Paris more than ever now that I have this book.
2,Not what I expected,earrings are too small and the post are very soft and bend very easily. Would not buy again or recommend
3,Why only 3 stars?,"This is one of my favorite movies, so why only 3 stars? Because I remember the theatrical widescreen release and the faded-color pan & scan video is butchery. The terrific set pieces such as the UN murder, the cropduster, the drunken cliff-driving, Mt. Rushmore, etc. lose much impact in the chopped aspect ratio. This film deserves the same fine restoration that Vertigo received."
3,Playful trip,"Like most of Hitchcock's films, this one has not stood the test of time particularly well.The fact that Grant is the same age as the woman who plays his mother is the least of this movie's problems. The dialogue is artificially witty, and the social morÃ©s of the day do not translate well today.In the end, this movie comes across as plain silly, sort of an old time Magnum PI, Hitchcock style. Frosting with almost no cake, enjoyable but no more than that."
5,The Greatest Hitchcock Movie and the Greatest Cary Grant Movie,"Easily the best Hitchcock or Cary Grant movie ever made--filled with suspense and comedy throughout. It works as well today as it did almost 50 years ago and doesn't seem dated. This movie can be watched over and over again with great pleasure. By now you know the classic cropduster scenes and Mt. Rushmore scene, but there are other great parts of the film as well. Other than it maybe being a bit long during the love scenes, this movie is picture perfect.It's one of my top five movies of all time."
3,good movie,We love this movie but it will only play on one of our blu ray players. I am very disappointed..
3,We need this in letterbox format!,"Top-flight film, unacceptable video. No other film I know suffers more in its video presentation. NxNW MUST be seen in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Please!"
5,Great movie,What a great movie. I watched it before I visited Mt. Rushmore.And the acting was fantastic. I know that i am going to be watching it again.
1,Buyer Beware,"My son (34) requested this for his Christmas gift. When he received it the DVD was defective, freezing up about half-way through. He then ordered one on his own, and this one did the same thing. Amazon is very good about refunds, but apparently there is a problem with this DVD. I hope Amazon gets this worked out with its supplier, saving customers the hassle of shipping it back."
4,This Hitchcock classic isn't for the birds,"I had viewed this film for a class I was taking in college, with no real intention of paying too much attention except for the music (it was a music in film class). Surprisingly I enjoyed this film immensly! The only other Hitchcock film I had seen is 'The Birds', which I enjoyed but I found it kind of predictable. However, 'North by Northwest' is constantly turning you in different directions so you don't really know what to expect next. I havn't bought this DVD yet, but it will soon be added to my collection."
4,Excellent movie;Odd DVD,"I purchased the single disc Anniversary Blu-Ray dvd. The cover clearly advertises sub-titles; yet none were available on the disc I received. After the disc loaded, there was the FBI warning and then the screen with the special features. The normal opening screen with the set-up options was not there and could not be accessed. It was as if this were the 2nd disc in a 2-disc release or the flip side of a disc that had been recorded on both sides with alternate versions of the film- ie one wide screen the second full screen with special features, which is what I received.That noted, the transfer was excellent; the movie looked beautiful. And the features I watched: a documentary on the life and career of Cary Grant and a documentary on Hitchcock and the making of this movie, hosted by Eva Marie Saint, were both interesting."
1,Don't Bother,"I received my ""NEW"" typewriter in an unusable condition. It was not packed securely and arrived severely damaged. The space bar was broken off and key arms bent. Several other key arms bent, shift key, tab, comma, period, c, d. I did not return the typewriter due to the shipping cost factors. By the time I paid all the shipping costs they added up to more than what the original purchase price was for the typewriter. I had ordered it for school since my printer wasn't working and it was a good price on the typewriter. What a waste of money that I didn't have. Don't buy."
5,Useful and full of alliteration,"This book is an old Billy Graham Crusade premium, but despite its age and overused alliteration, it's a helpful book for understanding a conservative view of the Christian faith. I lost my first and was grateful to get this again, many years later. I used it for quick sermon ideas!"
5,Disciplines of Life,"The Disciplines of Life is a treasure. V. Raymond Edman, former President of Wheaton College, has written an amazing collection of practical Christian advice for 31 various Disciplines that God uses to develop our Christian character. Danger...Darkness...Declining Days .... Defamation...Desire...Desolation ...Difficulty ....Disdain ... Doubt...Durability..etc. I am gleaning wisdom from this great man who uses the Word of God effectively."
1,Great book if you pass the authors judgement.,"I'm plannig a trip to Thailand so naturally I looked for some guides to help me out. I found this one and it initially looked very promising. The book does contain some good information, but the authors attitude does put me off. There are more than several instances when the author makes judgements on the different breeds of travlers often lableing them as ignorant or somehow not worthy. An example is if a tourist enjoys shopping the local goods as much as the local culture. Somehow this is beneath the author who seems very self righteous. I would like to send a reminder to the author that people travel for different reasons."
3,"""I'm Glad Your Back""","Overall I enjoyed so much of the choice of song they brought back to the Audience. I was very satisfied with the clarity of the Blu Ray.The only part which dissapointmented me so much was the Choreography of the Female Dancers, it is almost like watching a striptease dancing..If ever they decide to go to a national tour I wish they would redo the Choreography which would coordinate with the song. I love the song ""When you say Nothing at all"" but the Choreography was very tasteless.."
5,SKB Pistol Bag,"Perfect size for one pistol. Plenty of room for spare clips and gear.Rugged and water resistant on the outside, good looking and very nicley constructed. Quality gear all around."
4,suffers from lack of air time,"This effort from Dolby always gets pushed back behind the absolutely brilliant ""The Flat Earth"" and rightly so, its not as good. But take a second listen, listen to more than ""Blinded.."" and you'll find a collection of really good, high quality pop.""flying north"", and ""Airwaves"" are a lethal one-two punch on the CD. Which add quality to set up the already notable ""Europa.."", and ""One of our submarines"". Come to think of it there really is not bad cut on the whole album. Although the album seems to be the polar opposite of ""The Flat Earth"" I have taken a CDr and juxtaposed songs from the two CDs to listen to in the car and the two albums work together brilliantly. They do seem to be cut from the same cloth. If you like ""The Flat Earth"" get this before it goes out of print."
5,pure composition magic...,"The pinnacle of Gil Evans and Miles Davis working together. This is by far the definitive recording of Porgy and Bess as far as I'm concerned. I've listened to it a thousand times and it still blows me away. I wish I had the words to do this recording justice. Just listen to GONE and how it segues into GONE, GONE, GONE and how that in turn segues into SUMMERTIME. My goodness, the trumpet practically speaks to you, you can feel the pathos, the rage and the desire of the story. SUMMERTIME is the quintessential Miles. moody, full of passion, magical. Enough said. Get it. Listen to it. Enjoy it. over and over and over again."
4,Great Book,"I didn't know so many prominent people spoke on the subject. However, I was glad the writers researched and put together this easy to read book."
5,Fact and Fiction of the Wild West,"This book goes a long way in explaining why there was so much written about the Wild West and why so much embellishment took place.Throughout history there has been all kinds of spins put on the people involved and what really occurred.Why would anyone expect anything different during the expansion of the West,particularly after the Civil War? In dramatic times of history,be it the Wild West,WW2,Crime in Chicago etc.people are craving for an understanding of events as well entertainment,and that is what we are given by the writers and the media.Personally,I enjoy both the factual as well as the fictionalaspect of these times.One character who often appears in books is Ned Buntline.He was a real person by the name of Edward Zane Carroll Judson,and this book does a pretty good job of telling us who he was and some of the things he did.Somebody must have written a book on him;it would be a good read."
3,An Old Story,"I am old enough to remember the horrors the jews endured at the hands of the Nazis. That's not what I was looking for. I expected this book to be about crime in the fine art set in New York, Paris, or London. A book about what goes on there, who works in that arena, how much crime occurs, how much can a criminal benefit, who cares."
2,Rust horribly,"I purchased these knives in the stainless steel version (they only have the faux wood ones on here now) and quite honestly they were a disaster! They were indeed sharp, and an extrodinary value for the money but the rust was irratating. I am a very good cook, and own very expensive knives, but figured I would get a 'cheaper' set for occassion. My mistake, as even after cleaning and completely drying them, the next day therre would still be a slight coating of rust on the blades. I was forced to remove the rust with brillo! and finally just threw them out. Farberware claims they made a batch of these knives which were accidentaly not rust proof and mailed me another set. guess what, their replacement set also began to rust!!..."
3,Dull and weathered looking.,"I did not like this bracelet because I was expecting something shiny and my expectations are never to high. Anyways, the bracelet cam dull and weathered looking. I am rather disappointed but for the price, it's a steal!!"
3,OK Period Piece,"Mira Sorvino, tackling a role a la Gywneth Paltrow in Shakespearce in Love, proves that her Oscar for Supporting Actress in ""Mighty Aphrodite"" was well deserved. While the plot degenerates to silliness at times (especially the last 20-minute closing sequence), the movie is nonetheless acceptable for single viewing."
3,Kodak Z885,"I should have listened to the reviews I read before I purchased the Z885. The absence of a view-finder is a serious problem when taking pictures outside-especially if the sun is shining. You absolutely can not see what you are trying to take a picture of. Its really too bad because I like the number of pixels and the zoom is excellent. The camera takes great pictures inside and outside. Inside you can see your target fine; outside-you need to take a lot of extra shots to ensure you take the picture you want. Can't do that with grandkids,etc. Ok for static scenes outside (with extra shots). So, I am now looking for another camera."
4,Excellant Value,I bought this camera for $99 and it is an excellent value. I takes great pictures and it's 8 mega pixels are enough for most pictures. My only complaint is it needs an optical viewfinder if pictures are to be taken in bright sunlight. It is difficult to see the LCD screen on bright sunny days. But under most conditions it works great. I would recommend this camera.
1,Do Not Buy!,"I have had this camera for six months and have been very disappointed. Almost every picture has red eye, some are grainy and the flash is useless. I have missed many important pictures because this camera does not work well inside. If you are taking pictures outside in bright sunlight it is excellent. If you are taking pictures of your children moving outside it is great. Sadly any picture taken indoor is not good."
4,Great price,"It is a great camera for choice if money is the problem.It has many great features.There is a problem with taking a high ISO image between the shutter and the flash.The camera image will look jarred from the shutter opening and closing.The higher the ISO the Grainer the picture will become.Then again there is a bonus.35mm film cameras never had a ISO that high where the problem occurs,only cameras for fast motion were built for that.Took picture at 1600 ISO no problem.I have no problems with the camera myself.If i wanted a 1200.00 camera for that task i would have brought another one instead."
4,"Very Good, for Steady Hands...","When I bought this camera, I was very Excited. It captures with a professional style any photo, but it has serious problems with Motion Performances and specially with ISO-taken pictures. It looks a lot grainy and with extremely high noise. I tried everything to fix this, but is not possible. The video capturing is very good, and also the Smart Scene and Scenes Options are amazing. The Manual option is also great. The problem is Motion and ISO pictures.The Zoom its outstanding...For Semi-Prefessionals, I give it 3.8/5"
1,Great disappointment.,"I believe the phrase is: don't send a boy in to do a man's job. After hearing lovely performance after lovely performance of this opera live in Paris and being stunned by the vocal sublimity of Pietro Spagnoli's Conte, his absence here leaves Mozart's gem disconnected and pale. Where the brilliance and fire and panache one witnessed by Jacobs and Concerto Koln in Cosi? It was in abundant evidence in the live performances, that is certain."
5,I love it,there is nothing to dis-like about this case! I got it for my son and I am so jealous of it and bought another for myself. the compartments are the right size the carring strap is heavey duty. I have seen less quaility for more money.
4,Nothing like old time humor.....,"and Myron Cohen's Yiddish accent and sarcastic slaps take me back to a bygone error. No foul language.....just pure, wise tales like olden days. Nostalgic memories of a lost era."
2,Color Way OFF,"I have bought three of these spray cans so far. One was black, the other was clear coat. They were as I expected. However, I bought the Glow Orange can, and to my surprise, it was WAY OFF. It looks like neon orange, not like the orange shown in the picture of this product. Very displeased."
5,Great stuff,"Nicely thought out work. Lots of sources, good synthesis, important topic. Would recommend it as an entry way into the subject."
1,"Nice idea, but not worth the money","I bought this device to use with my Palm, but it kept dropping the connection to my PDA and had some serious accuracy problems. After some googling I found another manufacturer (Celluon) that makes a similar product - without all the problems I had with the VLK. I highly recommend the Celluon laser keyboard over this one (Just do an amazon search for ""projection keyboard"")"
5,another positive review,"This is the 3rd Nava book that I've so far read (Goldenboy and How Town being the others). I have to say that, over time, Nava's writing has improved considerably, as has control of his storylines. I now consider Nava to be one of the better mystery writers of our times. Needless to say, I highly recommend Burning Plain, especially if this is your first book by Nava or you are looking for an engaging mystery to read. Strong characters, complex plotlines, many memorable episodes, and on-going doses of humor and gay camp without being offensive or over the top. Interesting glimpses into Latino and gay culture. Not everything turns out positive in the end, but chalk it up to the gritty reality of life in Los Angeles (where the story is set). I read this over a 24-hour period--it was impossible to put down!"
5,"moon 44 ""EXCELLENT""!!!!!!!!!","THIS IS MOVIE IS A MUST SEE FOR ANY SCI-FICTION FAN,THE STORY IS GOOD,THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT,THEY DID IT THE OLD FASHIONED WAY, WITH MODELS, REAL EXPLOSIONS,HAND BLUIT MINIATURE LANDSCAPES,AND IT ALL LOOKS GREAT!. THE CAST IS ALSO PRETTY GOOD, YOU HAVE MALCOLM MCDOWELL AND MICHAEL PARE, THEY BOTH GIVE A DECENT PREFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE,BUT?, ANYONE WHO WENT TOO THIS MOVIE WAS THERE TO SEE THE VERY NEET ATTACK HELICOPTERS. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LITTLE MOVIE,WHICH DID SHOW IN A LOT OF MAJOR THEATRES IN (1989),AT THE VERY LEAST, THIS MOVIE IS WAY,WAY BETTER THAN ROLAND EMMERICH'S ""GODAWFUL GODZILLA "" MOVIE ,WHICH WAS A VERY, VERY ,BAD MOVIE!,INDEED."
4,This book is great for women just diagnosed w/endo.,"This book is great for someone just staring to understand this horrible disease. And, it is wonderful for someone who needs to feel that someone else understands the pains and tortures of endo. Jennifer Lewis explains things in an easy to read format w/an air of understanding and compassion."
5,When a close friend dies,"I think this book may help me in the loss of my 15 year old friend named Tim. I love ya man, can't wait to see you in heaven someday.Hannah"
5,A Love For All Time,This book was recommended by the lady that knows I love to read time travel. This is a wonderful and romantic story that I could not put the book down at all. I have shared the book with my friends that they love it.
4,Break Out the Buttered Popcorn...,"Two cops with opposite style and personalities who in the line of duty competeagainst each other to grab the news headlines.One cop dresses with style (Stallone) the other a little rough around the edges (Russell)are forced into a situation where they must team up together to bring down a Crime Kingpin(Palance)who framed them which in return got them sent to jail where Palance plans their demise.This movie was not made to get awards just an excuse to set back and loaf, have some fun, and passthe buttered popcorn."
3,okay action and humor flick,"The torture scene in this movie is something to fast forward through, but the rest of it is a fairly enjoyable action and humor flick featuring some good chemistry between Stallone and Russell.Good for some brief entertainment."
5,Tango and Cash,"I enjoyed the movie despite being long and a bit cheesy and silly,but I thought it was a fun movie,good action and fight sequences.The vehicles used were very neat,brief appearance of a black 62'Corvette,a Custom Armored Truck(Suburban)An International 9670 C/o Cabover Truck and some Construction Graders and monster trucks. I know were not used to this type of film with Stallone but I thought he pulled it off."
4,The classic Slowdive cd,"Thank you Brian Eno. A now classic in the genre that is creative and strong. I was so taken with it that I purchased ""Just for a Day"" which, unfortunately, is not even close. If you're deciding between the two this is the one to get."
4,Greystoke - the movie vs Edgar Rice Burroughs,"I saw this film many moons ago, and only recently read the original ""Tarzan"" by Edgar Rice Burroughs to answer a question from my daughter. The film did well to have gone back to the original for the most part, as the bit about Tarzan saving a French soldier from cannibals before he learned to speak was in the book and explained Lambert's accent just fine. I have to agree with the other reviewer about the silliness of the bit in England, though. The Jane in the book was a very dizzy 19-year-old American who chose Tarzan's cousin over him, and the film removed a lot of Tarzan's dignity by changing that part and the way he still saved Jane from a forest fire despite her having broken his heart...."
2,Worked great until it broke down,"We bought this thinking it would be a great product. We were able to get steam out of it for awhile, but we had to nurse it along. At times it drained out onto the carpet; other times it produced no steam. Even with nusing it, the humidifier broke down after three months and now we can't use it at all. Hope others have better luck with it than we did."
3,PUDDLES WATER,"IF YOU, PUT THIS DIEVICE ON LOW OUTPUT IT WILL CONDENSE WATER AND PUDDLE UNDER THE MACHINE. IT WORKS WELL ON HIGH OUTPUT WITH NO PUDDLING."
1,Stopped working after three days..,"It looked like a nice little humidifier when I finally received it after 2 weeks of waiting. But, only after 3 days, it stopped working. With no mist coming out of the unit, I can't call it a humidifier any more."
1,Do not buy this item!,"When you purchase a battery charger, what does that mean? You have a dead battery. Right? This charger will not work if your battery is dead. There is a feature built in that will not allow it to recognize a battery with 0 charge. If I had a low battery, I could probably get it to start anyway. If you want to spend $100 for a batter charger that will not charge a dead battery, this is the product for you.Thank God Amazon has wonderful customer service. They are giving me a full refund and paying for the return shipping."
3,Will it work,"I ordered this item and recived it looking used.So I am wondering will it work when I need it. It also came shiped from Amazon in a box with two boxes of nailgun finish nails that I ordered with almost no packing material.Maybe 3 of those packing ballons.I know help is hard to find,but fire that person. The product looks like a nice unit but I would like to put my own scuffs in it."
4,Barder's Parting Gifts,"Badger's Paring Gifts is a sad yet happy story. Badger was someone who everyone loved and could talk to. He helped them in many ways. The greatest gift Badger left them was the one of memories.Even though this is a sad, also happy story, I would definatley recommend this book. This story teaches that no matter what you will always have the memories you shared between you and your loved ones.Lynsi"
4,Great Portable Trimmer..,"Works smooth & quiet with no cord to deal with either. The accessory stand is skimpy and lightweight and slides around easily. The attachments fall out also...but, if you want a nice trimmer at a great price...pick this up!"
1,Battery Operated...,"I made the mistake of assuming the battery operated was a rechargeable battery. It runs on AA batteries which means you'll get better trims using a wooden block.It has virtually no ""umph"" to the blades which simply pulls instead of cuts.I went back and got a $10 more expensive blade that has a rechargeable battery pack and has a higher blade rate allowing for a true cut."
2,Wahl 9906-717 Groomsman Cordless/Battery Operated Beard and Mustache Trimmer,not all AA battries will fit in it
1,Not idea what other review are reviewing,I'm completely lost what the other reviews are reviewing - different product? Different model? The batteries don't fit into the slots.... I cannot comment much on the trimmer since it is completely DOA without been able to put the batteries into the device. The build was weak plastic on the body with metal on the heads. Attachments were pretty cheap plastic.Why do I have to give a rating one whole star? Stay away! Spend your dollars somewhere else. I just did a return and am looking for other options.
1,Poor quality,"I expected more in the way of quality from Wahl. The plastic case had parts that did not properly fit making even the simple task of inserting batteries difficult. I was not successful in this most basic of efforts. It may cut well but I never even got it to run -- and, I am no stranger to inserting batteries into small appliancesI packaged it up for return within 15 minutes of initially opening the shipped item.Thank you Amazon for an excellent return policy."
1,Was looking to replace a same brand,"This was NOT it, this thing will not trim wet rice,thread, spider webs. And is like mentioned SCREAMING loud. Built cheap compared to my intended replacement,'The Performer'. From the same company, unbelievable. The good one has lasted for years, many, many, many uses it deserves the rest. This one they should quit selling, and for more money. Buy The Performer, MUCH better value. I am off to beg for an exchange.~Edit:Follow-up 3/22/09 Finally, after 2-3 weeks I got a response to my repeated emails. Maybe Wahl will correct this. So far, Amazon has been WAY more upstanding, and willing to help."
3,"Works great, but VERY loud","I bought this to replace a cheap Vidal Sassoon trimmer that broke. This Wahl seems like a decent product, but it is extremely LOUD. I read another review where the author said he couldn't hold the trimmer up to his face because of the sound. I completely agree with this. The device is so loud as to be painful at times. It sounds like a weed whacker on your face. I'm not sure why this is, since other Wahls I've owned were very quiet (even the $10 Sassoon trimmer was far quieter).It does what Wahl claims it does, but is too earsplitting for me to give it more stars."
5,Good buy,The book was purchased for my 12 year old son who likes reading about animals (especially dangerous ones) and nature. He loves the pictures and text is easy for him to read. Very informative book that keeps him engaged. Fast shipping.
3,This Chick Ain't One in a Million....She only looks like it!,"She's OK but her songs aren't that great (her new one on the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack is sooo obnoxious) and she can't really song. She's just another teenybopper (like a more mature female Issac Hanson) who wants the fame and glamor. I totally love her clothes and she's pretty but she can't sing like Brandy, Mariah, Janet or Whitney (the real chicks in the business). I heard my cousin's CD of Aaliyah and I'm really glad I didn't waste my dough. Get Mariah's Butterfly or Brandy's Never Say Never. You'll thank me later."
1,Never buy from DVD Legacy,DVD Legacy never sends you your product!!! There is no way to get in touch with them because they don't even have a real website. It's been over a month and I still haven't received my movie. And now there isn't a way to be refunded. Terrible service
2,Average throughout,"If you own any 'best of' McCartney compilation (Wingspan/All the Best), forget about this album. It's an average album with no memorable songs. The only highlight is the extra track 'Mull Of Kyntyre' which is in his best of compilation. Other than that, its just a one off listening before retiring it to the home CD rack, to be forgotten forever."
4,Eclectic and Entertaining,"This is a vastly under-rated album, and often overlooked. There are a wide variety of musical flavours here, all presented with a slick pop veneer. McCartney is the consummate craftsman, and though some of the songs are perhaps a little thin the arrangements and the playing are for the most part on a par with any Beatles album. Highlights include the great acoustic track ""Don't Let It Bring You Down"" (it's funny to see which tunes stand up over long periods of time), ""I'm Carrying"" and McCartney-Laine's ""Deliver Your Children"". This album also features the worst song McCartney and wings ever recorded, ""Morse Moose and the Grey Goose"". The inclusion of ""Mull Of Kintyre"" and ""Girls School"" as bonus tracks make this one of the strongest (and strangest) McCartney albums."
3,A continuing Beatles might have deployed 2 tracks from here,"Apart from `Cafe on the Left Bank'--mostly nostalgic flashbacks of youthful times with John in Paris--and the bonus-track blockbuster UK. #1 `Mull of Kintyre', this album is barren of Beatlesworthy tracks. You'd think that Paul woold be getting ahead of John in that department during the second half of the 1970s, given John's househusband retirement, but he wasn't. There are some nice distinctively McCartney MOR tracks here like `With a Little Luck', but you can't put these on a Beatles album. I really tried to like `I've Had Enough', but despite some humour in the lyrics, it's just such a ploddingly pedestrian number. Still two fine tracks are better than none."
2,McCartney at his most cuddliest.,"This is typical of post 1976 McCartney- a couple of hits with loads of filler.I remember this when it came out and seeing him on interviews and you'd think he just released the second coming of ""Abbey Road""-an optimism he'd share over and over again with hisfuture albums-most of this wouldn't be good enough as filler to the great albums.I think the last great McCartney album is ""Venus and Mars"" and after that stick to the hit compilations.""Band On The Run"" deserves its place as one of the best form the 1970's and it's nice to see ""Ram"" appreciated more today than in the past.But his solo career has been very patchy at best.This contains ""With A Little Luck"" one of the more corniest songs to hit the top 40 and it also hit number 1.So so so so so so."
3,"What it was really like ""below stairs""","This book gives you a greater appreciation as to just how hard the ""below stairs"" staff worked to make the ""upstairs"" look effortlessly graceful."
2,Disappointed,"It seemed to repeat many things, the story went nowhere really. I read this book in a couple of hours there was nothing really to thrill me I kept reading hoping to come across more interesting material."
4,Where are the photos?,I'm reading Below Stairs now and am really enjoying it. One thing I am missing though are photos in the book of Margaret Powell herself. It seems a shame that the publishers chose a generic Getty Image maid for the cover. Photos of Powell do exist and I would have liked to be able to refer to them as I read.
2,I didn't finish the book,When I read firsthand accounts of lives from past times I enjoy getting to know the one with pen in hand. This book is an exception. As I started reading this book I get the impression someone placed a microphone in front of Ms. Margaret to record her ramblings. I don't believe she wrote the book. I was left with the impression that she did not value her life experience below stairs and she was surprised that anyone would be interested in it. I didn't learn anything by reading this book. Boring....
4,"delightful, and there is more","The book is a delight for its honesty and a special window into a life that is very different from ours. The narrative is observant, direct, and informative about a world now long gone. If you read to live a little slice of a life not your own, you will like this book. But it is not brilliant, so don't expect Remains of the Day or some such.The reader above who complained he wanted more should check out Powell's other books, including ""Climbing the Stairs"" and ""Albert: My Consort"", which continue her life and report the details of her successful connection to Albert the Milkman. ""Climbing"" can be found on the US Amazon, but for the others one might need go to Amazon.co.uk, which is just as accessible as Amazon.com, but of course, the shipping is a bit more.Powell has written several other books including cookbooks, indeed it seems she scribbled right away, but they are found only in the UK as of now."
1,Recalled!!!,"This item has been recalled due to contamination with cryptosporidium which can cause diarrhea, fever and vomiting.I ordered this from Amazon twice and got the recalled item both times-lot # 26952V and an expiration date of 10/08.Do not give it to children and check your bottles!"
5,Return to History,"In a very convincing, well documented way Ralph Woodrow makes clear what is often confusing in the context of the very young futurist approach to explain Biblical prophecy. He instead uses the historical approach, a method which has stood the test of time. The book answers those unresolved questions for a reader curious about a more historical explanation of what has already happened to fulfill Biblical prophecy and what Christians can expect to happen in the future of the Church. Well worth reading."
5,Looks great on hubby's truck!,"Heavy duty, quality looking hitch cover. Looks great on my husband's truck - he loves it! Highly recommend this Steeler hitch!"
4,Laugh,"I had not seen this movie in a long time and it was great to share this movie with my family. I laughed as much today as I did when I saw it last. It was a great buy, would reccomend it to all my friends to see."
5,For those who like brain films (literally),"This is pretty much slapstick humour delivered with great vigour. The plot is basically about a man (or professor) whos in love with a brain, just a brain no body. It's such a simple idea and yet it's so funny just for how different it is, pick this up if you just want to laugh hysterically and have a good time. I have seen a few Steve Martin films before and this is the best i have seen out of all of them as the plot just seems to move by and the film gets funnier and funnier there is also that Dracula spoof that Steve Martian does which is really funny aswell so thats another Steve Martian film i would recommened."
1,um...one word - BAD!,"I hated this movie. My dad bought it cause it was cheap, and it's the stupidest movie in the world! What a waste of time and money. I love Steve Martin, but come on! If you're a Steve Martin fan buy housesitter or something! NOT THIS! SAVE YOURSELF!"
4,Ranks Right Up There With Martin's Funniest,"Here is another Carl Reiner-directed ""farce"" that also stars Steve Martin (the two collaborated before in the '80s in ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid""). This is the best of that duo with a lot of laugh-out loud scenes. There are tons of gags, both obvious and subtle. In fact, I think is one of Martin's funniest performances.I had remembered this as a strictly light comedy but was surprised when I viewed it again this year and heard all the sex jokes. Reiner turned out to be a dirty old man but he write and direct some very funny movies. It's unusual for a comedy to be rated ""R,"" but that was the appropriate rating. If you know and don't care if its a bit raunchy, this is a very funny movie."
4,Admire someone for their mind,"The first time I saw this film I couldn't stop laughing. It has taken me many years and a few TV viewings to finally get around to buying it. Thankfully it is still as good as ever. Who can forget the lake scene? Or Steve Martin's character searching for a suitable body? I like the idea that the film focuses on someone who falls in love, quiet literally, with a woman's mind and not her body. It is a pity that all of Steve Martin's good films were made during the 80s - I hope that he rediscovers fun for the OOs (?)This is a good transfer, the picture quality is excellent. My only complaint would be the lack of features - trailers for other Steve Martin films?"
5,Cars 2 Review,"Cars was a classic movie and the second was a long awaited joy for myself and most importantly my two children. My son always wants to watch it. This combo pack makes it so I can have the movie everywhere. 3d at home, DVD in the car, and I keep the digital on my tablet. Overall I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase."
1,It's an Edsel,"This movie is a dog's breakfast. I think the audience spoke for itself as half-way through all the kids under say 9 years of age were beginning to wine and talk from the sheer boredom of the movie's thin and unengaging plots. All the innocence from the original movie is lost to violence, mindless explosives and repetitive use of the word ""kill."" Such scenes would be a thrill if your expecting the Bourne Identity, but the mix of genres is just a mess. I miss the character development from the first movie. Gone is the grand supporting cast of Red, Ramone, Sally, Sheriff, Philmore and Sarge who are relegated to short cameo appearances. It's obvious the writers tried to do too much with this movie and ended up with a sloppy amateurish mix of parts and pieces. Verdict: It's a heap."
4,Perfect!,This Is an awesome movie! It does have multiple dark disturbing scenes in my opinion (I am 9). Two cars die and it really should not be rated G. Mild Violent scenes are current and only about 11 minutes of the entire movie takes place in Radiator Springs. I think its target audience is the little kids who saw the first movie in theaters and are years older now. I recommend the movie for 7 year olds if they can handle it. Bottom Line: Great movie with cute characters picks up in violence from its last installment despite its young target audience.
3,Just used it for the first time,I ordered this product quite a while ago as a gift for a grandson and ended up giving it to him for Christmas. Someone noticed a scratch on the DVD and we were worried that it would need fixed - we found that it worked okay when played. So we do not need to return it. It was shipped in a timely manner - we appreciated that very much.
1,"Awful, betrayal of franchise's toddler fans","My son loved the first Cars. It's slow moving and sweet with recognizable personalities. Cars 2 is totally inappropriate for him, violent, herky-jerky, with an indecipherable plot. You cannot imagine a real or imagined gun, let alone automatic weapon in Cars 1. Cars 2 has guns a violence in spades. Not a movie you can put on to have your two year old unwind.They made a 180 shift here and I can't understand why. They should have stuck to the toddler market. I think they betrayed and ruined this franchise. Spy movie? Why? WHO CARES! SO bad!From Russia with Love (Two-Disc Ultimate Edition)Don't buy it. If you want a spy movie buy From Russia with Love instead."
1,Way Too Political,"When I watch a movie like Cars 2, I don't want to be hit with a lot of political messaging. This entire movie felt like one big commercial for alternative fuel. Regardless of where I stand on the issue (I support alternative fuels), I don't want my entertainment to be this political. I can't remember ever being more disappointed with a Pixar effort."
3,Too much death,"I don't like that my 6 year old son had to ask a number of times, ""Is that car dead?"" throughout this movie. I really bothered him that cars kept dying. I agree with the reviewers that state this movie is more for the older 8 and up crowd, it was just too much for my little guy to comprehend."
1,Too preachy,"Too preachy. CARS 2 pushes the environmental ""sustainable"" agenda, BIG TIME. Returned it and will not allow kids to watch it because we do not believe environmental, nor any other agenda, should be pushed. Do not need movies telling us to buy and believe in alternative fuel, like CARS 2 does. It is one thing to choose on your own to buy alternative fuel. It is another to have Disney/other characters telling you to buy it. Not the place of media to tell us what to do, nor what choices to make."
3,Not as good as Cars the first,Cars 2 is a cute movie. I do not recommend it for under age 9. The action is quick and the accents are not easy to pick up on. I showed it to my LLD class (ages 15-17) they loved it.
2,"not the movie I am rating, but the 720p","720P download speed..... Really.Here is the problem.. I spent the big bucks on the big screen... dvr's, Blu-ray (ya, I know bad call on blu-ray.. but who knew?) and what do I get..... 720P.I spent the bucks on Internet,also... 20meg download speed...still 720P..Amazon, I really want more from you. cut loose some of your $$$$ and install some fast internet lines with Big pipes (think mircosoft) and redeem yourself."
3,disappointing,"Cars the first movie was really cute we watched it several times. Cars 2 kinda disappointing just didn't quit have the same feeling we got bored in the middle couldn't wait for it to end. Yae, it's a cute movie you just never can beat the first."
4,Excellent.,"Just a quick review to say that I too liked Cars 2 better than the original, which was long on whining and maudlin Hudson backstory. Don't get me wrong: I liked the first one, but I loved the second, which introduced two great new characters (Finn and Holley), suggesting an indefinite franchise (yay!), and made Mater, who is more complex than Lightning, the star. The situations and what Mater says and does in response to them are hilarious! The plot twist at the end is a genuine surprise, hard to pull off these days. The genius social commentary disguised by car puns continues. The ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is that I don't think a ""G""-rated film should have a character (car or not) being tortured and murdered, even off screen. While it is true that youngsters might not pick up on that, many will, and I found it disturbing to watch with my four-year-old daughter (our first movie in the theaters together). Otherwise, I loved, loved, loved this movie!"
3,NOT FOR A 3 YEAR OLD,"Took my three year old son to the movies to see this one. It was his first time at a movie theater and wanted to leave half way through. I think he liked the first one better. Cars 2 is pretty much a spy movie and I feel like it's not a movie for a young child. I feel like it is too violent. They have bombs strapped to mater, the cars are shooting at each other and say lines like, I'm gonna kill McQueen at the finish line. I won't be buying is DVD for my son. Surprised at Disney that they would come out with a violent movie."
2,Not good for little kids,"I'm not sure that this deserved a G rating. This sequel is a Bond-style spy thriller. There are LOTS of explosions and bullets flying. Mater is rigged with a bomb at one point. In my opinion, this Cars movie is far too violent, fast-paced, and dark for little kids. (My son is three.)"
3,Average movie...,"It's definitely a watchable movie but it centers a lot on Tow-Mater, not necessarily one of my favorite characters in the movie. It was cute in the first one, but it leaves a bit to be desired in the second. It's like many other sequels...they're trying to play on a popular character. I can see where that would work, but it was not one of my faves. But all in all, it was worth the watch if you can buy the movie for a bit under regular retail. I purchased the blu-ray and DVD combo for about $16.50...at the time a great deal. It was an hour and a half of fairly enjoyable entertainment, but really, I liked the first one better."
5,"Arrived quickly, fast transaction, and in perfect condition","This DVD arrived quickly, was a fast transaction, and was in perfect condition. Happy and satisfied! :) :) :) :) :)"
3,"I liked it, 3 yr olds lost interest quick","My 3 yr old boys love the original Cars movie so one day when we had nothing else to do I bought them Cars 2 via Amazon Instant Video. The story is a little too deep for 3 yr olds with not enough to keep them interested. The sequel seemed geared toward an older audience and personally I enjoyed watching it. Oh well, 3 yr olds shouldn't be watching TV anyway, right?!"
1,Thumbs DOWN - Save Your Money,"There are several decent reviews here (read them), my purpose it to add my two cents. Movie was a huge disappointment to me and my children (ages 6 to 9). A failure on many levels. We loved the first Cars, and have watched it on dvd over and over and over again. That won't be the case here. My kids were even sorry we'd spent the money on the big screen, and they do not want the dvd at home - which says a lot! If you just have to see it, don't pay more than $1.00 at Redbox. .... What a tremendous bummer this movie turned out to be :-("
5,Thunder thief.,"This movie is my baby niece's current obsession. Auntie did so well, that she didn't pay attention to anything else she got for Christmas."
2,It's no Cars 1,"Compared to the first Cars this movie falls flat on its face. I don't know if the director thought the momentum of the first movie would carry over and they wouldn't have to try as hard, but this movie did not meet expectations."
4,Happy with my purchase,"Came quickly, and in great shape. And works great. Very happy with this purchase, made my son very happy that we got his old one replaced quickly."
2,SUBJECTIVELY DISAPPOINTING...,"This is, of course, a subjective review. I am only writing it so that a buyer like myself might be able to avoid the disappointment which I experienced when I listened to this recording. This is Ms. jackson singing to some significantly pompous arrangements and orchestrations of mainly white Christianity anthems. Think of a football game halftime in Christian Texas with a very good marching band with some strings added. Perhaps in the 1950's this made perfect sense. Sorry, just not what I was hoping for. Why is it that the only Mahalia Jackson recording which I really, really want is the one that has never, to my knowledge, been released on cd. This would be the Columbia recording titled ""Bless This House."" If Columbia is willing to let us have ""The Power And the Glory,"" Why can't we have ""Bless This House?"" Which as far as I am concerned is so much better."
5,At the end of every chapter he makes a very suspenseful seen,"Frank and Joe Hardy go to California on vacation. They go to a concert of the Funky Four.During one of their songs a spotlight falls down in front of the star singer Brian Beat,so the concert has to be stopped.After the concert Frank and Joe go to a arcade,a suspiscioucs looking person comes by,his hat falls off...Brian Beat! But all of a sudden he get's mobbed,but Frank and Joe save him from the mob of people. Brian decides to have Frank and Joe be his bodygaurds.But the there are attacks on Brian's life can the Hardy Boys stop this viscious villiain??????"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though if you're a fan of Hitchcock you might be interested to see what he does with a real life version of his ""wrongfully accused man"" chestnut, The Wrong Man is just not that good a movie: relying on a true story means that not a lot happens and the things that do, like Vera Miles' breakdown, don't really work."
3,"could be a 5 star, but...","Idiot Pilot mixes the smoothest vocals this side of Radiohead with excellent instrumentation and cool electronica. For a couple of 18 year olds this is amazing stuff. BUT...then the screaming starts. This may go well with Linkin Park but it doesn't fit with this music. The guitarist doing the screaming seriously sounds like he's had his private sawed off with a rusty razor blade and will soon die. It truly is a shame, because everything else is near perfect. I wish them luck in their future and hope that their next effort will be without the unecessary screeching."
5,Greatest Hits by Jimmy Dean,This item was bought as a Christmas gift for this year for my Father-In-Law. I'm certain he will love it.
3,I gotta say....,"I love black metal. I'm a female. there are ""some"" tracks on this that i like ok. but it goes with noting that i think that the vocals are ""overdone""? music rocks but i don't care for the imitation of black metal from a this female artist. seems to me that a bit of unique vocals would be better with this music. good idea. just not the vocals! throwing me off!"
3,I'm with Yikes!,"Sorry, if you guys think this review isn't good, but there is NOT much to say about this book. ( Mostly, it is what she sees and hears)This book looked great on amazon.com It started out good, but then dragged on and on. I couldn't make it through this one either, and had to return it back to the library. Some parts were interesting, but most parts were dull and boring. There were a FEW good parts, I'll admit. (this was half way through the book) This book is mostly about things she ""feels"", and ""hears"". There is one part where she sees him, and it's not even really scary. It takes a lot to make me read a book all the way through, but maybe I'm just really picky. I would check this book out or borrow it from a friend before I ordered it off amazon.com to see if was my ""style"" of reading. Not the best ghost story. I too, question her story, but, I wasn't there. So, how do I know?"
1,Just plain silly,"The author is obviously a ""woowoo"" as my mother would say. Her obsession with the occult,angels, and other things make this story seem as though it is something she created in her head. I just read it most of the time rolling my eyes. There is really not a single thing scary about this book except perhaps the writing style, and the authors flighty personality."
4,Spooky Read!,Why she bought this house I will never know but I'm glad she did so she could write the book and tell us all about it. The house was old and spooky to begin with but she fell in love with it - even though it needed a lot of work. The previous owner had been an older man who lived there alone except he rented out some of the rooms. At first I was scared of him but you will soon realize he is not threatening to Annie and her family but some of the other ghosts are. I'm not even sure I believe in ghosts but at night after reading and laying down to sleep I know I had some strange and sometimes disturbing dreams.Wilder has a nice writing style - very conversational - as though she is telling you all this over a cup of tea. I found the book delightful and was sorry for it to end. I am looking forward to reading other books by her and I hope everyone enjoys the book as much as I did.
4,DIRTY HARRY TAKES A LIGHTER TURN,"There is a decidedly comic touch to this installment in the Dirty Harry franchise, the kind that makes it more eminently watchable than its otherwise strict formula of boilerplate action and escape sequences would have you believe.Eastwood had visibly aged by this film, which he does well to display in his mature reserve as he takes potshots at the mafioso, television news, horror movies. His antics are strongly supported by an able lineup, including a very convincing Patricia Clarkson as a pesky news reporter with morality pangs, Liam Neeson as an avant-garde director from across the pond, and, surprise surprise, a young Jim Carrey as a rocker-slash-druggie. Probably the best cast of any Dirty Harry caper.The plot is hardly an intrigue, but barring some cheesy ideas like a certain danger posed by a toy-car, the film has a good deal of suspense to keep you glued for its length.Recommended rental."
4,The Last of the Dirty Harry Series,"Well, it's a Clint Eastwood flick, and that's enough for me. You'll see the usual elimination of the punks, and some great lines to go with it. Harry's partner in 'Dead Pool' is one tough dude... I thought he was great. And of course you'll see Harry at odds with the administrators (something that really strikes home for me, as I was a high school teacher for 32 years in a district where the upper administrators were much like the ones Harry had to deal with... only interested in political correctness and their own personal advancement at the expense of everyone else). The other reviewers have given you an idea of the plot and the story itself, and done it very well. As you'd expect, in the end, the bad guy gets the point."
2,wrong order,"I was hoping to give this as a gift. It arrived yesterday in the green color but I ordered the cream. The main reason I order from Amazon is the great deals but more importantly the convenience. It's difficult to return this because I don't get around easily. I won't be giving this as a gift, the green color is really ugly."
5,Legends of the Classics=Legends of the Classics,"This is not what I was expecting when I starting to play it as the cover is just covered with the names of popular 60's groups that started out in Laurel Canyon and I was half expecting a concert.What I found was a beautifully woven narrative of some of the greatest names in Rock and Rock along with some awesome video, some I had seen, others I had not and interviews with most of the band members.This video does concentrate heavily on CS&N; so if you don't like them, you might not like this video.For me this ties up alot of lose ends as I was not really old enough to go to Woodstock (close however) and this fills in many of the gaps and in my opinion is a welcome addition to my video collection. One that will be listened to time after time."
2,Biased,"OBVIOUSLY put together by David Crosby as if he wanted to iconize himself so he wouldn't be forgotten,approved by Stills & Nash.HEY GUYS ------------ YOUR MUSIC IS GREAT SO YU DON'T NEED A DVD SHRINE !."
3,Wait for cable release,While it was good it isn't worth it unless you spend your entertainment dollars on DVD's.Many artists are listed on the cover but not much in the DVD.
3,Not What I expected,"It was interesting, but more talking than music and a bit boring in places, still, for those of us who were teens when these legends were performing, there is a lot of interesting insights."
5,Enables you to express when words fail.,This book is amazing. It allowed me to put words tothe overwhelming feelings of pain and rage. This book is a useful tool in trying to understand our own feelings when they are mirrored back through wonderous poetry.
4,"CONNERY,HOFFMAN, BRODERICK...OH MY!!!","And Sidney Lumet behind the camera? This had all the earmarks of greatness but FAMILY BUSINESS is what its principal characters are: under achievers. But what great fun! This is Connery chewing scenery ( dinner at Vito's, the prison van, the Pee Wee Grogan story). Vincent Patrick, who wrote the screenplay from his own novel, knows NYC street people and the landscape is genuine. There's worse things to waste 100 minutes on than this."
4,Courtroom Techniques in a Nutshell,"This slim volume raises many helpful points about cross-examination and the courtroom dynamics, but falls short in that it is presented more as an outline than in-depth information. It is a good read to get an idea of what lawyers have to consider when cross-examining a defendant,but not as instructive as one would expect from Ehrlich. Providing a greater array of actual cases and their dialogue would have been of benefit. For a general reader, it presents interesting information and some amusing anecdotes on what can be a tedious subject."
4,"A fine, if not dated, horror film","Granted, the movie does have some 1970's made-for-t.v. freeze-frames that make it seem a little hoakey at times, but bearing that in mind, Salem's Lot: The Movie has some truly scary scenes that make it all worthwhile (and I agree with the other reviewers -- see the full miniseries if possible; the chopped up version leaves too many glaring plotholes and jump-cuts). It's not an accurate representation of the book, but it brings some of the book's scariest bits to life with an effectiveness that is residual (I've never gotten over many of the scenes) and satisfying, especially when you consider that it first aired on CBS in the 70's. Rather than focusing on how dated the film is, though, pay special attention to how director Tobe Hooper crafts the frightening scenes to create an air of dread that will leave you dreaming of the film for weeks afterward. Definitely worth any horror fan's time."
4,Good,"This movie is better than most horror movies. Tobe Hooper, restricted to tv limiations, trades gore for atmospere, showing a real talent. Who can forget the window tapping in the show. Barlow the vampire is terrific, especially his first appearance in the prison. James Mason also does a very good job, his seductive voice is perfect for his character. David Soul is also good. I watched it twice, and it was even better the second time."
1,Displeased,"When I placed my order with you all it showed that I was buying the 1974 version of Salem's Lot, the one I wanted. When it was delivered it was the 1994 version with Rob Lowe"
2,Poor Attempt,"When Steven King first started having best sellers there were a few attempt to bring them to light in the movies. The trouble was that they often got watered down to a point that they only resembled the original story line, but was often a different story. After watching The Shining (Original version) I decided to read the book to see what scary parts didn't make it to the movie. I found that most of the book didn't make it to the movie. I did basically the same thing with Salems Lot and once again found a huge disappointment. I understand the remake is supposed to be a lot closer to the book, but I haven't seen it to compare to this movie."
2,"2 Hour SnoozeFest, 1 Hour Horror","I am a huge fan of horror films. I do enjoy a low budget take and I'm not overly critical so long as I'm entertained. I rented Salem's Lot b/c I'd heard it has some very scary moments but I was disappointed. The film is 3 hours long and the first two are insanely boring. I kept watching only b/c of the promise of the vampire (had seen it in photos) and b/c my husband seemed entertained. If you hate overly long build up do yourself a favor and fast forward the first two hours. The movie does not get scary until hour 3, and then yes, there are some very scary moments."
5,Wonderful,I am a fan of Stephen King. He is my favorite author. I have quite a few movies that was made from his books.
1,More conservative drivel!!!!,"While the author makes some valid points about sexual health and the importance of taking STIs seriously, deep down this is just repackaged Dobson.It is published by the ""leading conservative publisher on policy issues"" and should be read more as a tract on conservative sexual values than a medical guide. She, like all conservatives, bemoans the 60s yet again and is convinced that waiting and secondary virginty are the answers to all that ails teenagers.There are much better books, without the conservative slant, to be had on this important and complex issue."
4,Nice little light,"It's a nice little light for the price. It serves the purpose I bought it for, so that's all that matters."
4,Love light,"Fun, cute, useful. As advertised. Will order larger size next. Light is bright and useful in dark spaces. I gave two of these as gifts and they loved them. Thanks"
5,Nice product,"I'm ordering an additional one--this handy light became our preferred flashlight during nighttime power outages. In those situations, it is particularly handy on the bathroom counter or other places you need your hands free! Very flexible and sturdy."
1,Crap,the squeege they give you to put them on scratches the crap out of the screen and doesn't really help in getting air bubbles out. You need a clean room to not get lint under the screen and once they're on if you try to peel them off the corner usually bends making it snag on everything. Worst screen protectors I've ever used.
5,Good Brand,Writeright Universal Screen Protectors - just the right thickness and durability for digital camera screens. You can't go wrong at here.
3,not even close to perfect,I got this screen protector because I couldn't find one for my kindle fire at walmart. I was thinking o I can do this. I spent about 40min. Applying this and it went on pretty good id say. But along all the edges are a line of air bubbles (off the screen the whole way around). So I can see them all the time. Kinda annoying but I guess ill get used to it
2,Not made Right,"Like others have said, the product has some major flaws for a screen protector. Its near impossible to get all the bubbles out and when you use THEIR squeegee, expect scratches galore. I have the Hero and when the phone is on, you can't notice the scratches ""too"" bad but why even include the squeegee if it scratches up YOUR product? I've only had the protector for a day so I can only imagine it will get worse."
2,More trouble than its worth,"The picture on the box shows what appears to be rather flexible sheets. They are in fact quite rigid. I bought these for my iPod screen, and while they have kept it scratch free, it's probably impossible to apply one of these without trapping at least some dust or small debris underneath. They have lines on them to help in cutting them straight, but none of the lines are in the right place for my iPod. The screen on the new iPods are slightly recessed, in fact the exact amount these are thick. If you cut it to fit just right, there's no way of getting them off without picking at it with an exacto knife which of course has the potential to do extreme damage. These were good for a ""quick fix"" while I looked for a more practical screen protector, but I would never buy them twice, or even recommend them for that matter."
4,Too much be-bop is like too much reggae,I think it is a fine album but not quite as ecclectic as Caravan. Straight be-bob becomes tiresome just like reggae in my humble opinion.
5,"Excellent recording, great music!","I was casually interested in Art Blakey years ago until I bought ""Moanin'"". What a great band he had put together! I continued to explore with this recording, and am not at all dissapointed. In many ways, this is better than both Moanin' and Free for All, but how can you get too picky, really? All are excellent recordings, all feature top notch performers, notably Hank Mobley on this one.Really fine stuff, worth buying for any Jazz / hard bop fan."
3,New or copied?,"The ad said product was new, but the DVD was not in the original jacket as if a copy was made."
3,"Dead meat, Beddoe. Dead meat!","The Clint Eastwood-Orangutan sequel to the amazingly popular ""Everywhich Way But Loose."" The Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, Josey Wales, and Will Munny is shown here cavorting around with a monkey, listening to country music, pursuing the dreadful Sondra Locke, and bareknuckle boxing.This movie is very dumb, but still alot of fun. The highlights are the Black Widows biker gang's encounter with tar and the fight scene between Eastwood and his rival, Wilson(William Smith). On that fight scene, it is fun to note that Eastwood has never shied away from paying tribute to older films in his movies.(Pale Rider=Shane.) That final fight scene is obviously based on the John Wayne-Victor McLaglen duel in ""The Quiet Man."" It even includes the intermission in which the two fighters drink a beer together before resuming the fight! As Liam Neeson said to Jim Carrey in Eastwood's last Dirty Harry movie, The Dead Pool, ""It's not a rip-off. It's a homage."""
4,why can't I add half-stars?,"because this is an amazing three-and-a-half star album, but i'mnot sure it's a four-star. there are a few cuts- ""Yankee, GoHome"" (which i love musically and find humorous as hell but which has potential to alienate more than a few listeners), ""Jerusalem on the Jukebox"", which i still get stuck in my head occasionally but which might not have the same stamina four years down the road, ""Pharaoh"" which is just midtempo drudgery, for the most part... but, having said that, ""Turning of the Tide"" and ""Waltzing's"" are worth the price of this disc threefold, especially ""Waltzing's"". i defy you to find me a finer lost love song written in the last forty years. perhaps ""nightswimming"". but ""waltzing's"" in the same closet."
5,Greatest story ever told,Wilbur Fields is my favorite author. His commentarieson the books of the Bible are a must for the seriousBiblical scholar.
4,Intense Skinny Puppy,"I'm just commenting on the Seattle music fan who is so upset that Skinny Puppy don't sound like NIN. To which I cheerfully say THANK GOD. In terms of talent, that little Spin-cover posing, noncing mincing girl's blouse of a Marilyn Manson svengali Trent Reznor couldn't match Nivek Ogre on one of his WORST DAYS. If you're into Gadzooks clothes and wearing white greasepaint to your local HOT TOPIC to buy your latest Korn T-Shirt, leave Skinny Puppy alone. But if you're a dark SOB and like drinking in pure atmosfear, SP are the way to go."
4,Good introduction to Muddy Waters.,This is a compilation of Muddy Waters later work. Most of it was recorded in the late 1970's. It is a list of all his most popular songs and a good way to introduce someone to Muddy Waters.
4,Good product,"It is a good product, but you need to practice a couple of times before mastering the whole kid-shopping cart thing. I put 4 stars because I think it's too bulky and I thought it would be smaller."
1,YAWN!,"If you like lots of blood and guts in your horror fiction with cardboard characters, then you'll probably like ""Riverwatch"". I, however, tried and tried to get through this book but eventually gave up. I believe this is the type of book that is written in the hope that a producer will pick it up to make one of those supposedly-scary-but-quite-laughable horror movies with second rate actors. I recommend not wasting your time with this one..."
2,Ham-handed and a rather ho-hum read ...,"I had high hopes for this book. Seeing how it has been spoken of all over the Internet. However, I found the pacing to be slow, and the characterization far to cardboard, which made it hard to truly impossible to care for the protagonist.It was in need of better editing."
2,A disappointing read,"Although this book has an interesting, and fairly original plot, the writing lacks the intensity that makes for a good read. I frequently skipped pages, and by the end, found myself skipping entire chapters just to finish the book. The characters are flat and impossible to identify with and their dialogue and actions are described with nauseating detail. This book also leaves a number of seemingly important details unexplained, including the bloodstone(assuming I didn't accidently miss the details while skipping pages).I bought this book based on the positive recommendations of other Amazon readers, and fortunately, this is the first time I've been disappointed with the reviews."
5,Always available through amazon,"The part was hard to find in any home building supply center and plumbing supply. Amazon makes life a lot easier, thank you"
5,Splash guard,"Works great, makes the garage disposable much quieter with no splash coming back up., could not find at a local store. Very good price."
1,Piece of junk,"This appears to be the same junk I received with my disposer. The flimsy rubber gasket comes off nearly every time I remove the stopper from the sink. A durable machine like this should not be sold with such a cheap part. The opening of Waste King is a quarter of an inch smaller than most disposers, so a stopper from the hardware store will not fit.If anyone knows of a replacement that will fit, I'm listening."
3,Did Not Need,"I did not need this part. When ordering the Waste King, it came will all parts necessary. I returned it with no problem."
2,Not Needed,"I ordered this and the dishwasher kit when I ordered my Waste King garbage disposal. It was a waste of $9. Neither item was necessary. It would cost more to ship them back than the $9 I paid for them. From now on, don't order items that Amazon suggests that go with the item you are ordering"
4,OEM Replacement,"Have a Waste King disposal that started to shoot the splash gaurd out every time it was switched on.fixed it iterim with some duct tape till I decided to just replace it, lasted over ten years so expecting this to do as well.Kitchen will be due to remodel by then."
5,Best Bang for the Buck!,Works like a champs. Some review sites like Conusmer Reports said this unit is noisy. No Way. It is much more quiet than my other ISE unit. I highly recommend this WASTE KING.
5,Worked perfect!,"I had read a prior review that said this worked on his Sinkmaster, After checking that the original part would cost $30, made by the same company as this, I ordered it for my Sinkmaster, Model 850 and it fit perfect. Complaints of water draining slow, can be true at first. But after using it for a month, it is much better."
3,"it is so easy to forget your boyfriend, huh?","Liz swears. She swears that she loved Tom to death, but yet she was cheating behind his back the whole summer long, even plotting ways to steal Ryan from Jessica. That's not love- at all. Liz just can't live her life without a guy to lean on. Indepedent, she is not."
5,I heart Cathy!,"Very cute, ""Cathy through the ages"" theme. Pulls strips throughout the 20 years of Cathy, even some really early ones, back when she was skinny."
5,Takes me back,"They just don't make music like this anymore. These songs get you moving from the begining to the end. Singers like Lisa Lisa,Debbie Gibson and Taylor Dane sang with so much emotion. This music takes me back."
1,not what I expected,If you are buying this for making alterations to your photos its not badBut if you are like me and you want to burn your pics to a dvd slide show with music forget it. Tech support is rude too- on the bright side they are free (to my understanding) but perhaps thats why they are rude.either way the program does not support mp4's (it does support mp3 and wav) what i tunes uses so you can forget music with your slideshow and then in order for your computer to support the program for burning you will have to remove whatever other program that is using your burner there is no flip flopping- a lot of work little reward
4,Great Software!,"This software is so easy to use. It doesn't have ALL of the uses that some software has but for the small time photo nut, this is perfect. It has a great array of frames. Very useful."
3,It's marginally usable and a decent value,"I'm a simi-pro videographer with high standards.Overall, I'm disappointed with the Raynox. The sample I received is adequate for some non-critical work, but isn't good enough to be considered ""high-definition"" by anyone's standards.The center 1/3 of the image is quite sharp. The next 1/3 out is softer but acceptable. The outer third is quite soft. The corners are terrible. Distortion is high with severe curvature of vertical lines near the edge of the frame. And chromatic aberration is very obvious and disturbing even in the center. Changing the F-stop makes very little difference in image quality.I may keep it just for those situations where a .5X converter is the only lens that will work. But I'll never use it when my .7x Canon converter will do."
2,The Joy of Reflexology,"Much more basic than I had hoped. Looks like it is written as a basic primer for nursing school. Somewhat disappointing. If you want a book that digs into the ideas of reflexology and technique, this is not it."
5,Get Wise! Mastering Writing Skills,"I got this book for my daughter, who is in high school, and she loved it! She really liked the lead character, Chi, who is a teenage girl. It's a really fun and interactive way of learning how to write and I'm going to get her the other books in the series."
1,Wake Up People!!!!,"I sit back in awe of so many things and watch how the Bible, God speaking through men to deliver a message to mankind is mocked and laughed at but this trash gets rave reviews. God tells us of our creation, where we went wrong and our redemption. Our Creator the One True God, and this no longer works for people. What is it people need to know from alien? Pray tell me? We were created to worship God and seek His counsel not aliens or those who claim to channel them which are evil spirits because they lead you away from God or at best to another god.We now have people such as Barbara who claim to channel aliens? Creaturesthat she is not even sure she is dealing with and people flock by the hordes. Do you know why? It is shameless in its message that man can do no wrong. Look in the world today....People are becoming hateful. You need to put your trust in Jesus because this world will pass away. But who am I, just a fanatic for loving God."
2,I have see better,I taught a class using this book. There are better books out there. The book needs to be updated and seems to skip around (or does not flow very well)
1,Don't Bother,"I sadly only got through the first few chapters and after I'd counted over 25 inaccuracies had to stop reading it. It does not appear to be sourced or cited, and much of the writing is based on popular myth from the era, not on historical fact. I'm appalled that it was actually published under the guise of a biography. Furthermore, the book was poorly edited and written for about a 5th grade level of English. A total disappointment."
3,A bit bland,The characters of Saladin and Richard loom large in legend in addition to history. This book is a fair treatment of the historical events surrounding their times but lacks details and color that could have made it great. It is a worthy addition to one's library of books on the Crusades but certainly not what it could have been.
3,Interesting reading,"I enjoyed the book. I'm interested in history, but I'm not a historian. The best way for me to become more schooled in history is to read historical fiction. I believe this book falls into that category. The author makes an attempt to sound like a historian, but there are too many independent thoughts from the characters in the story. It is close to a scholarly work, but it really is historical fiction. If the book is approached from this perspective, then it is good reading and very informative. The historian will find this book to be lacking. For my part, it was enjoyable and I recommend it to anyone who would like a good overview of the Third Crusade and the relationship of France and England in the Middle Ages."
4,Deep and inciteful; vague yet clear; well-put together,I thought Silas Marner was a good book. I was assigned to read it for school and I thought it wasn't going to appeal to me. I found that I enjoyed it thoroughly. It kind of started off slow but after that I couldn't put it down.
3,beginner/intermediate ab video,"OK, I'm a big Denise Austin fan, but in my opinion, this is not her best work. First off, I like it better when she does more intermediate videos. This one is more on the beginner side. And I think 15 min could have fit into 10 min. For a better ab workout, check out her Personal Training video. I love the ab workout on that one. But if you are a beginner and want to tone up your abs, this could be a good option which is why I gave it 3 stars. There is a little bit of cardio in the 1st workout, but not enough to burn any serious calories. Overall, good toning workout for abs, but those who do ab workouts regularly won't be challenged."
2,Craftmenship below par,"Ya, they shipped quickly, this is the reason for two stars. However the product is way below par. The female end fails to fit properly. We purchased two of these together and both of them had the same problem.We do NOT recommend this adapter at all."
2,Caldecott Medal Winner?,"I know this is a Medal winner, but I don't understand why. The pictures consist of only 4 colors and it is quite dated. Other than the poem on the first page, the story line is not pertinent to children. The book uses the term ""mustard plaster"". I don't even know what ""mustard plaster"" is, much less a child reading this book.I bought this because I want to own all of the Caldecott Medal books. but I didn't enjoy reading this and my 2 year old never asks for it. It is collecting dust. Save you money and borrow it from the library."
4,Slow to start but is great at the end.,"One of my favorite books ever is ""Earthseed"", by Pamela Sargent.The book is about a group young adults who were born and raised on a space ship,called Ship.Ship is like their parent and cared for them since they were born.The book opens when they are about 16 years old and soon they will be leaving Ship to settle an uninhibited planet in a far away galaxy.The book goes into detail about all the main characters,including Zoheret,the protaganist.Things start to pick up when they move to a simulated Earth to experience what life will be like on their new homeworld.Soon the groups splits and anarchy breaks out.I don't want to divulge the rest of the plot but after this happens theaction doesn't stop 'till the end.Some scenes are violent and there is also romance in this great Sci-fi book"
4,Nicely made but would prefer different pillowcase,"These sheets are soft and fit nicely on a toddler mattress. But the pillowcase is sham style, with a slit down the center back, instead of standard style with the opening in the side end. You can't flip the pillow because of this."
2,Ecclectic Mixture,"I'm Not Sure How To Describe This One. Paul's Experiment I Guess. It Is Not Agreeable With My Tastes, But I'm Sure Some People Will Like It. I've Listened To It Twice, That's Enough. I've Always Hated The Musical Wasteland Of The Eighties. Mac Sounds like He's Trying To Blend In With The Other Music Which Was Released Then. Too Bad, He's a Great Composer/Musician."
1,Paul Takes Advantage of Us,"I am a big McCartney, Wings and Beatles fan, but based upon the quality of the songs and the lyrics it must of took Paul all of three days to write and record these songs. This album is sure to disappoint all but the most zealous fans. It might disapponit some of them too."
4,I actually LIKE this album,"After reading everyone else's reviews, I was gettin' kind of scared....I guess everyone has different tastes! I remember hearing this for the first time on Eight Track in the early 80's, and after searching for 15 odd years I finally was able to find the album. ""Temporary Secretary"" is odd, but fun. Waterfalls, I will agree, sounds like TLC completely lifted the lyrics from Sir Paul (hey, didn't George Harrison get sued for something like this?? Geez...)Favorites are ""Secret Friend,"" the classic ""Coming Up"" and ""One of these Days."" I automatically skip over ""Check My Machine."" No thanks, Paul.But otherwise, not a bad little album."
3,It's Fine,"McCartney II is a fine CD. It has some good songs and some that are just fine. It may not sound like silly love songs. But you can tell it was a time when McCartney was either trying to find how to start the 80's. So I guess why not start from the Beginning ( McCartney I ) started well. The only complain i have is the song Coming Up which is heavy on the bass sound. You may have to give it more terrible when listening. In any case McCartney fans will love it. And for the ones that don't care, wait for the Remaster greatest hits. Enjoy"
4,"Actually, this album grows on you....again!","Disappointed with the extra tracks. Very thin and probably won't be listened to much. No extra liner notes. Good sound quality. I know that the super-deluxe hardback set has better extras, but come on, it is too expensive, and the original Beatles albums didn't get such lavish attention; does McCartney's solo efforts warrant it?This double disc set should have had more extras included. If only so the common fan could afford it.Update: I have to say that the bonus tracks grow on you. All You Horse Riders, while seeming insipid by its title, is actually a very catchy tune, and it is partnered with Blue Sway (one of 2 versions on this set). I actually love McCartney's spoken/sung ring-master vocals on Horse Riders. It is innocent and a bit haunting. Sounds a bit like Duke Ellington speaking.I forgot just how great an album this is, and I am changing my 3 starts to 4."
1,Give Me A Break!,"This is by far the worst album by Paul McCartney and one of the worst by any major artist! What has often been defended as ""raw"" comes across as more like half-baked. No other artist than an ex-Beatle could get away with releasing such Junk (and I'm not talking about the halfway-decent ballad from the first McCartney solo disk!) Almost all of the tunes are irritating and amateurish in both their composition and execution. Paul explained that he made these tracks for a tape to play in his car - maybe he should have left it at that. Perhaps we should give him some credit, as he has managed to sound both dissonant and bubblegummish at the same time! The only saving grace at all is the acoustic ""One Of These Days"", which compared to time-tested McCartney ballads is an OK throwaway, but next to these attrocities sounds like a near-masterpiece!"
1,Bad Is Bad,"Huey Lewis once did a little tune called ""Bad Is Bad"". Turns out that tune sums up McCartney II very well. I am amused by all the fans who try to justify this album. When Paul is good, he is not only good, he's absolutely the best. But when he's bad, well, he's bad. I listen to this and it is hard for me to believe this is the same guy who wrote all those great Beatle songs.So, let's be honest and call it like it is. There are good Paul Mccartney albums. And then, there is this collection of rubbish.Bad is bad."
3,Always unpredictable,"MCCARTNEY II proves just how unpredictable James Paul McCartney can be. Maybe that's because he seems to love all kinds of music, and those who follow McCartney's post-Beatles career will note that he has tried close to everything. Released in 1980, MCCARTNEY II dabbles in new wave sound. OK, it does not satisfy as much as most of his many albums but still offers four worthwhile tracks: ""Coming Up,"" ""Bogey Music,"" ""Darkroom"" and ""One of These Days."" Now the newer CD version offers bonus tracks including the disco single ""Goodnight Tonight,"" adding value. For would-be Paul McCartney listeners, I would first recommend safer bets such as BAND ON THE RUN, RAM, OFF THE GROUND, PRESS TO PLAY, WINGS AT THE SPEED OF SOUND and FLAMING PIE. But MCCARTNEY II delivers just enough, and I also like it because McCartney once again dared try to something different."
5,"Great Book, do not miss!","This is a very good book that will pull at your heart strings and make you laugh all in the same book.Lynn Johnston is a very big two thumbs up!Witty, adorable, funny, the best!"
4,80's music will never die-it just gets respectable,"Unashamed 80's rock about cars, chicks, booze, and of course the color red. ""This Planets on Fire (Burn in Hell)"" is worth the price of admission alone. The opening riff instantly transported me back to my teen years. My hair grew and my face broke out!"
3,Passable interpretation,"There is nothing particularly wrong with the dvd, except for the content. I read the book in my final year high-school, and was quite inspired by the character. The movie, sadly, is just a chronological presentation of the events of the movie, and lacks the meaning and wit of the book. Buy this if you're a dedicated fan, otherwise, the book is better."
4,Good movie,"This was recommended by a lot of friends. They all seem to like it a lot more than I do. It's a good movie, but I don't think I'd ever call it a great one."
5,"A Brilliant, Mind-Blowing Black Comedy!","Never before have I viewed a movie with such imagination, heart, and extensive use of foreshadowing and irony. Watching ""Garp"" makes one realize how both beautiful and morally bankrupt our society is, and that we 'truly' reap what we sow. From feminism exploitation to marital infidelity to gender-alteration, we witness the undoing of the principal characters through acts of selfishness, greed, and sheer loneliness.This movie, however, will not appeal to the typical moviegoer, but rather to one who enjoys volatile, politically incorrect subject matter from a psychological perspective. ""Garp"" toys with your mind, soul, and heart from beginning to end, and its twisted humor remains as gripping as its dreadful tragedies.Indeed, ""Garp"" is not for the faint of heart, but ironically, ""heart"" is what the movie ultimately delivers."
3,Audio Problems with Garp,"This is one of my favorite movies, and I waited with baited breath for it's DVD release.Video rentals of this movie have provided a disappointing experience as the tapes are usually worn out and in bad shape.However, I was severely disappointed by the sound quality on this DVD. Granted, it's not surround sound, but the stereo mix is so bad it's hard to watch. The mix is brassy, full of hiss, low volume, and comes directly from the center speaker. It sounds more like a bad mono soundtrack, and I'm extremely disappointed with it.My quandry is that if I advise people not to buy this, we most likely will get nothing better as the distributers will take this as a sign that there is no interest in this film.Please purchase this edition to support the movie, but be prepared to be slightly disappointed with the sound. It should be noted that I couldn't fault the image quality."
2,"Sad, sad, very sad","A very talented singer, but why not chose some upbeat songs. My woman left me and I am heartbroken gets a little tiresome after 13 songs."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to get this CD thinking that since it won album of the year at the CMAs it would be awesome.There are about 2 -3 good songs on the CD, just expected more from George, now I am worried I will wear out the CD just replaying the 3 songs I like."
1,Not Really a Refill Kit,"This kit contains replacement pads only, NOT the polishing compound. I thought that was odd, considering that it's called a ""refill kit,"" not a ""replacement buffer pad kit."""
2,Fatalistic,"She complains alot. I have very syptomatic fibrods. I had been looking for information on treatments, causes and prevention but this is just depressing."
3,I thought the book could have been better.,"This book was an intresting read, but I thought it could have focused more on general scholarships for all students, rather than scholarships for students who go to specific colleges."
3,Musical take on Sturges classic,"For fans of Preston Sturges' 'The Lady Eve' (1941) this unnecessary but nearly-as-amusing 1956 remake provides an interesting look at the sharp-witted screwball original (four-plus stars) through the decidedly less sophisticated technicolor lens of a 1950s romantic musical-comedy. In fact, though one can hardly compare the screen presence of leading man George Gobel with that of Henry Fonda (ditto for Ms. Gaynor and Ms. Stanwyck in their respective roles, with David Niven a fine proxy for the great Charles Coburn), the replacement cast delivers laughs on a par-- in quantity if not always quality-- with their iconic counterparts. For those not familiar with TLE, 'The Birds and the Bees' remains a light and enjoyable 90 minutes filled with good performances, which I hope will be sufficient inspiration for them to check out its classic predecessor. 3-plus stars."
4,docked one star(r) for short running time and 2 weak songs,"This album starts off like a bonafide classic with Goodnight Vienna, Accapella (great song! ) and Ooh-Wee. Unfortunately, it doesn't maintain that level, including the clunkers Husbands and Wives and Call Me. Husbands and Wives is a touching Roger Miller song, but Ringo's pipes just can't pull it off. Call Me may be the worst song he's ever written, and he's written some pretty wretched ones. Also, Nilsson's Easy For Me is ill-suited for Ringo's voice. But there are seven really strong songs on this album, and the Richard Perry production is better than on ""Ringo."" Plus, there's the great bonus tracks, which make this a winner."
4,good cd,"if you want a far superior version of ""When the Levee Breaks,"" listen to Led Zeppelin's masterpiece-and no it's not a cover, just lyrically similar"
5,anthemic,"why doesn't dischord offer this essential music anymore? what an injustice. a grossly underrated and all but forgotten hardcore punk band from when i was first heavily involved in that scene, beefeater were mind-blowingly original, hugely inspirational and couldn't really be compared to any of their contemporaries of the time. but if i had to try, i'd say they had the same urgency and conviction as bad brains--with an even broader scope and range of influences than said band. beefeater were a bit too ""quirky"" or funky for some more close-minded hardcore and punk types' tastes, but that was truly their loss. they are still in my top five or so bands ever."
3,song,"does anyone know the song that the violin players play when franks body is dying. one of them says something to the effect of ""gentlemen, playing with you has been the greatest honor of my life"" then they start playing some nice song, i wanted to hear more. if you can help thx"
4,Covers the bases.,"This does have all the ""Big Hits"", but this band is so much more!!! Check out ""Vivid"" for a all out non-stop rock n roll fest!!!!"
5,Allen's classic! Still a best seller.,"This was the book that piqued my interest in real estate. The two words that got my attention were ""Nothing Down"" because at that time, I had nothing to put down on a property.While many have followed, Allen was the first to bring to the masses the efficacy of using No Money Down techniques.These techniques are time tested and proven. They work. This version started it all. I would recommend that you get Nothing Down 2000 which is the newest, update version."
5,Panis Angelicus,"I bought this CD for that one song alone! My parents had a compilation LP (now in my collection) that included Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews, and many other incredible singers. I think it was a giveaway at Christmas at the Firestone tire store -- no I'm not kidding -- and the most incredible thing on that whole album was Robert Goulet singing Panis Angelicus. I had never heard the song before, don't know Latin.....but oh my GodI picked it up on eBay a few days ago. There were 3-4 other copies available. While I do have that vinyl LP, and enjoy all of the other songs and singers on it, this is the one I ""need"" on CD format so I can carry it around, load it into my computer, include it in my own Christmas playlists.... I am looking forward to the other material on the CD, but all I need is Panis Angelicus. Obviously, for me this is the definitive rendition of this beautiful song."
5,The best kids vitamins!,"My kids have been extremely healthy since they have been taking these vitamins. Just think, a year and a half with no sick days! There are no bad addititives."
5,Real Hip Hop,"This return of Slick Rick does not touch the pinnacles of his early days, but that is just due to the flooding of the market with too much substandard hiphop/rap. The artform has been devalued....but let's get back to this offering.MC Ricky D gets 5 stars from me, not because of nostalgia of hearing The Show/ La-Di Da-Di as one of my most endearing memories of hip hop.I give respect to one of the greatest characters that hip hop ever produced. I was just getting disillusioned with the whole thing and there he is. 34 years old and still bending ears. First it was Free Slick Rick, now it's Slick Rick Forever. Listen to the ill offkey rhymes of ""I Own America"" and the necessary ""Memories"". Nobody can take his place at the mic. Did you see him at Rapmania in 1990? Damn.I feel sorry for the younger hip hoppers today. Most of you will grow with no musical memories of your youth.But hey, don't sleep.The Ruler's Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Very Chill Disc,I have Alot Of Miles Davis Music.THe Man is Amazing To Me Period.His Work is Timeless.It Gets Better&Challenging with each new Listen.THis Album is a Sleeper.it hasn't gotten it's Props Like it Should but it's Worth Checking into.though I prefer other Recordings more this is one is Good.Joshua&the title track really stand out.Miles was always ahead of the Curve.
2,Disappointing: New Agey not Authentically Celtic,"This book is disappointing from beginning to end. The author seems to be sincere in her spiritual quest and anxious to share her insights with the reader. However, I'm not sure her insights are worth reading. First, the book is not about ""Celtic"" anything--it's an American's view of Scottish culture. Second, the author appears to be only superficially acquainted with Scottish history and traditions. From those impressions, she extrapolates generalizations about ""Celtic"" mindset and worldview that are not supported by the evidence. Indeed, those not new to Celtic cultures may question her conclusions. If you are interested in learning about Scottish culture and spirituality, I recommend Noragh Jones' _Power of Raven, Wisdom of Serpent_. That book will give you authentic Scottish tradition in a modern context."
5,I USED to hate self help (self pity) books for singles!,"What a surprise to read a devotional book for singles that doesn't patronize, marginalize or wallow in self pity! To the contrary, these beautifully written devotional thoughts look unflinchingly at the whole of life as a single adult and simply hold us accountable to be the person God created us to be! I love that the author has obviously lived a full and rewarding life as a single adult. Because of that life experience, the voice of the book assumes that I, the reader, might actually have a rewarding life as well and be older than 22! What a novel idea!"
4,"Good follow-up to book 2, the real ""start"" of the DH series","This is a funny, sexy, entertaining read. Since I use reader numbers and ratings to help me determine which books to read and/or purchase, I wanted to add my vote even though everyone before me as ""said it all."" A good follow-up to Kyrian's story, (book#2) which was really the ""start"" of the DH series. However, even if you read this series out of order it makes sense and is enjoyable.With this story, Kenyon starts t throw in more than just Greek mythology with adds to the interest of the characters and storyline ""surprise"" twist at the end."
4,digital copy costs more than a paperback???,"I love this author, but why on earth is a digital copy more expensive than a paperback??? Who wants to pay for that???"
4,Night Embrace,"An enjoyable read. Good story line, very sexy characters, with a warped twist of humor. I like Kenyon's style very much."
3,Not my favorite,"This book took me forever, I mean FOREVER to read. I actually feel bad for Talon. Why, you ask? He had to follow up Kyrian's story, which totally rocked. This book fell flat for me and I really didn't want it to. I didn't feel the romance was the main focus of the story, and even though I loved the fact that Talon and Sunshine had a great connection, I did not get that dreamy, Ahh, after finishing it. I immediately put it on PBS for a book credit. Don't get me wrong, I love the Dark Hunter series, and this book makes Archeron even more of a mystery, building up his book, which is still oodles away. I am slowly making my way there. I have Dance with the Devil, Zarek's story from the library in my possession. Can anyone tell me if it's better than Talon's story? If you read Night Embrace book, let me know what your thoughts were!"
4,Still Going Strong,"This was a great continuation to the series, I especially loved Sunshines's character. Zarrick is next and I can't wait!"
5,"Splurge for vegetarians & carnivores alike! Eat morels, save a cow.","The first time I ever tried morel mushrooms was at the famous Chez Panisse in Berkeley, CA, owned by Alice Waters. WOW...it was so amazingly good, and I'll remember that meal for the rest of my life.If you're currently a vegetarian, but enjoyed beef steaks in a past life, you may never crave beef again, once you've had morel mushrooms. They're a bit pricey, but worthwhile for that occasional splurge. If you're a hard-core meat eater, you're gonna think that you're eating beef. Morels have a great mouth feel, where it's more steak-like in texture, and not watery, like oyster or button mushrooms.If you're thinking about preparing a special meal, include some morels the next time. If you already love various types of fungi, this is gonna be the BEST you've ever had."
5,Great CD!!,"One of the best jazz CDs I own, out of over 1000 cds in my racks. Its only a matter of time before the rest of the country picks up on how good this sextet really is. They are not into self-promotion, simply playing music they enjoy. Very tight arrangements, strong bass lines without being overpowering and just a really nice sound. As I said, one of the best CDs I own, destined to be one of the best you own as well!! Makes a great holiday present to a jazz-lover. Can't wait for the next CD by this group."
4,Great perfomances and musical score!,Robert Deniro and Liza Minelli give wonderfull performances as a couple who teamed up in the most unsual way to play nightclubs as a saxophone player(deniro) and a singer(minelli).The movie contains great musical scores and wonderfull choreography .
1,Don't waste your money,"If you like movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s - particularly musicals - you'll hate this. It's modern Hollywood filth. My copy is now in the wastebasket."
5,Best Italian Cookbook ever,"My current copy of the book, purchased in 1977 is falling apart. I am buying a replacement for it. Without doubt her recipes are easy to follow and produce delicious results. I like the way she suggests a complete menu for each recipe. I also own her second book but this is the one, the now coverless, page-loose one I prefer. Buy it, your family will thank you."
1,absolute garbage,"Steelers logo looks cheap, but that doesn't even matter because the damn thing didn't even work. Doesn't pop bottles. Garbage."
3,Tamrac Slim...,"A good tote-around replacement for Nikon's ""steal me"" neckstrap. Adds color and easy detachment. The 'narrow' style is a bit uncomfortable but color and convenience are worth the price."
3,D-Day,"This book was a good addition to scholastic's My Story series, but it is like reading an encyclopedia, instead of a diary."
5,The best underrated men's cologne on the market !!,"I love the scent on this cologne. Very clean, light and refreshing. When ever i wear this cologne i get so many great compliments from both men and women. This should be part of your cologne collection."
1,fake,"this is not the real stuff and I'm VERY dissapointed, as it does not have any smell and I do not think it's really Calvin Klein, but just a fake."
3,cool gadget,i got this armband a couple of month ago. and heres what i came up with. hope it helpsPro-stylish-comfortable-fits any size-perfect protectionCon-gets dirty easily-too expensive-not easy to reach-(mine) plastic cover is ripped after couple of usesEDIT*It DOESNOT fit the NEW nano perfectly! the holder is 1 cm longer (becuz the new nano is smaller than the old ones)
3,iPOD armband,This product doesn't get much use by me because it's to small for my arm. I rate it 3 stars for someone who it fits well but 1 star for me.
1,I can't believe they released this,"What were the producers thinking? A high budget remake of stories from the original Twilight Zone does not get better simply because they are done with newer equipment and effects - sorry.Three of the four tales are, as I mentioned, remakes from the original television show (""Kick the Can"", ""It's a Good Life"" and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet""). While the 1959/60/61 shows were good, these suffer in comparison. The fourth was an original (thank the stars for at least some originality!) featuring Vic Morrow as a bigot who is hurled into the lives of those he hates most.This movie could and should have been a monument to a series which has weathered more than 40 years and is still fresh (and popular) today. Instead, it just falls flat.Recommend you bypass this movie and simply buy the original television series by Rod Serling on DVD. You'll be much happier with them.~P~"
2,These filmmakers just don't understand The Twilight Zone!,"What a waste. All those talented filmmakers and the end result is a poor excuse for hommage. The remakes show a remarkable lack of understanding what Rod Serling did with his grand series. The Twilight Zone did not use cloying sentimentality to tell more whimsical fantasies (the ""Kick the Can"" remake) and it did not use bug-eyed monsters and outlandish visuals to tell a story. On the Twilight Zone incredible things happened to ordinary people in ordinary surroundings: that was what sold the drama and made it effective. The Ackroyd/Brooks teaser is amusing, particularly the comparison of the Twilight Zone with that other classic anthology, The Outer Limits, but it is definitely not a Twilight Zone moment. A pity Spielberg, Dante, Landis and Miller didn't actually review the series in order to understand what Rod Serling was saying. Even the mediocre episodes of Serling's other anthology series, Night Gallery, are more entertaining."
3,Did you know??,"This scared the living daylights out of me as a kid (although eight years old is probably a little young to watch it!). However the ideas behind the stories are actually pretty good - like having every wish you make come true sounds good, but in practice, perhaps not...? John Lithgow shines as the hallucinating air passenger, and makes for that segment being the spookiest. Best viewed outside the context of the series - try not to compare them!And finally, a piece of trivia - The actress playing 'Ethel' in one of the four movies is the voice of Bart Simpson in the Simpsons cartoon series."
3,Hard to recreate magic twice.,"The Twilight Zone - The Movie was a film I liked as a little kid but watching it now on DVD, it feels like a disappointment. The four segments are not equally good, the only segment that stands out is the final one with John Lithgow. He is such a brilliant and intense actor, only he can pull off that classic William Shatner episode. Kick the Can and It's a Good Life are pretty outrageous and lame. Sorry to say this film doesn't stand the test of time, buy the t.v. show instead."
4,WHERE'S THE DVD??,"Would someone at Warner Bros. get moving on a dvd of this? Haven't fans waited LONG ENOUGH?? Commentary, widescreen, deleted shots, remaster - EVERYTHING! COME ON! DO IT!"
4,"A ""Good and SLOW"" Movie","This movie is SLOW and LONG (2 hours 35 minutes)----the ""desperados"" stand around glaring and arrogantly smiling at each other minute after minute! But, with the likes of Henry Fonda and Jason Robards and Charles Bronson on screen doing the smiling and glaring it almost becomes interesting! And then there's the ""Italian Lady""---oooo la la! She is ""candy for the eyes""....so, even though this thing is S L O W moving, I enjoyed it anyway---especially due to the fact I was able to ""take a break"" from it for a day and divide it into two parts! Recommended! Email boland7214@aol.co"
5,Best Western. Or joint-Best Western anyway!,"I can never make my mind up between this and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.Im not going into detail about why this film is so great - just watch it. Forget True Grit. Forget John Wayne. Watch a classic - a true classic.For all european buyers - this one runs fine on any UK/European blu-ray players so dont worry about that. The slipcase matches the UK 'The Spaghetti Western trilogy' box set quite nicely too even though that is completely unintentional!Just buy it - you wont regret it!"
1,"""Cue the MUSIC""!","Where oh where do I start? First off...this is a MESS of a movie! Director Leone knows TWO shots in this film...close up and REEEEALLY CLOSE UP! I watched this film on TV with my family when I was around 12 and we ALL laughed our heads off during the screening. Everytime there was a supposed dramatic moment, that GOD AWFUL music would chime in! And what's with casting Henry Fonda as the villain?! I thought at any moment the aging star's TEETH were gonna fall out onto the dusky plains of Italy! Lemme try to put this gently...this movie STINKS! Extreme close ups, BOMBBASTIC music and ENDLESS scenes sans dialogue DO NOT a classic make!"
1,Artsy crap!,"I'm sure that I'm going to get a bunch of comments telling me that I ""just don't get it"" like anyone does when they write a bad review of something artsy but here goes.This is the only movie with Charles Bronson in it that I've ever seen and not liked, he's one of my favorite actors. And I love westerns, pretty much anything with John Wayne or Clint Eastwood is gold. Hell, I even love most of the cheap spaghetti westerns but this film SUCKED!!! Every damn scene is drawn out till it's completely dead and dried up. It's ten minutes of silence and camera panning then two minutes of talking then ten minutes of silence and panning again. Over and over.This is not a western. It's a artsy joke. Easily the worst cowboy movie I've ever seen!"
1,Seriously overrated,"I'm sorry, but making a movie to be deliberately 'arty' does not make it a good movie. I've watched this movie and wondered 'why the hype' throughout. I've then tried to watch it again and given up early in the movie. The soundtrack is maudlin - indeed, miserable (sums up the movie). Cinema is supposed to be entertaining - this movie is not!"
4,Seems to work fine.,"Not something I'd usually get for a dog, but we had a harsh winter and i picked it up free on a 4 for 3 deal. Dog seemed unimpressed, but it did seem to make a difference. The wife thinks I'm crazy for getting this for a dog though..."
5,amazing!,"Ile Aiye : the best ""bloco"" from Salvador de Bahia.A wonderful tribute to the afro-brazilian music.Few words to describe : intense, highly emotional, saudade !"
5,What a leader - what a gladiator - what a mind !,"I don't read many action books or novels, but I love this book!A very perceptive, quick thinker caught in ""The Most DangerousGame"" - human War). The book HAS to be read for one to have an opinion, a personal one.The veracity of his accounts has many endorsements and no rebuttals, as far as I can tell. To this day he has maintained a high visibility, and mud slingers would have no trouble sighting this target.Bill Schaefer"
4,The Man From Stone Creek,"As usual, I enjoyed another book from Linda Lael Miller and found several mistakes. They need to hire me to read for them and make the corrections."
4,closetmaid 8505 15-cube organizer,"Before I purchased this item, I did read that for some folks the slots were rather small for men's shoes. Since I have a rather small foot, I thought they were worth a try. After assembling the product and lugging them upstairs, yes, I was pleased with my purchase. I will admit that even though I have a small foot(size 7), some of my shoes were a little snug. This product is fine for a small foot, but probably not good for men's sizes. Might even work best for children's sizes."
2,Too Small,"I bought this item becuase it looked like it would be a wonderful way to store and organize the shoes in the mud room. However, unless you live with little girls, this thing does not work well. We can barely get one shoe in one of the slots. I have three boys in my house, so it really doesn't work. I love the concept and it is easy to put together and very sturdy. Just wish it would fit 15 pairs of shoes not 15 shoes. PS - forget boots."
4,A play full of conflict and self-observation,"This can be an enjoyable read for anyone. Wilson's language and dialogue is beautiful. Descriptions of the piano are gorgeous and Wilson does a good job of making an inanimate object seem almost mystical. This is a play that should be read by everyone, regardless of race. It deals with many racial issues, however the main conflict between Boy Willie and Berniece is something that anyone can have an opinion on. I personally thought that both Boy Willie and Berniece had good points and one could sympathize with either of them, but their arguments tend to hide the truth to both of them, and possibly to the audience. The end of the play is a revelation to them both, and can be to the reader as well. Regardless of your background, you will enjoy this play as it deals with the importance of hard work and the betterment of one's life, contrasted with the significance of history and ancestry - issues that anyone can relate to."
3,Great Unit ...BUT!!!......,"This is a Great unit, the navigation is on point very accurate, the camera is cool too, easy to operate. My only gripe is that the battery does NOT last like navman describes, I get about a little over an hour at best(lowering the brightness can help), also even when I store the unit with a Full charge and then power it up it again the battery charge is slightly used up!!????..how can this be when the unit is turned off?...So make sure you have the power cable at ALL TIMES. Also the screen is NOT anti-glare, so you will have a hard time seeing screen in the day time, night time is best.Well,in conclusion other than the Cons listed above this unit is recommended."
3,Surprised,"I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD A FULL VIEW OF THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE SIDE, BACK & FRONT VIEW."
1,product didn't match the item in the store,"I discovered this bra at Nordtstom and loved it so I ordered a bunch more from amazon.com where the price was better. The bras that arrived were not the same. The cup came up way too high on the outside and dug into my armpit and the straps were about about 1 12"" further out the shoulder so they kept falling off. I ended up sending the rest back. I assume that le Mystere changed the design but I don't know which design was older and which was newer."
5,Dream Tisha is amazing!,"I have worn this style of bra for years and I LOVE them! Be sure to get fitted. It is so important to get the right fit. Everything looks great with these bras as a foundation. There are no lines and the support is amazing. My breasts are very heavy and before this bra, I could not find anything that was attractive and without lines to give me the support that I wanted and needed. You cannot go wrong with this bra."
2,"Durable, but too bulky, Runs Large","It seemed to be made to last, very durable. Yet this makes for a very large bulky bra. It was hard to move in and was not very appealing to the eyes. It is practical and not pretty at all. The cup sizes run large, so I returned it and got another style from the same company that fit a bit better."
3,Not sure what all the hype is,"It's a bra. I have it on now, and it's just a bra. It does what it should, nothing more."
3,smells weird after washing,"I like the bra itself, but after I washed it, there was a weird smell that I can't seem to get rid of. The smell wasn't there when I received the bra and I've tried everything I can think of to remove the smell. It's barely tolerable, but the bra is nice and gives awesome support."
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"I have always enjoyed Krentz aka James' books but this one seemed like she was trying to rush a story into print. She needed to take time and put some meat into this one. Tabitha goes on a cruise by herself. She's insecure and hoping to meet Mr. Right. She soon falls for an injured passenger who she saves from an alley, shortly after he was beaten. Now she is trying to make Dev into her perfect man. All he wants to do is go along with her so he can get into her pants. Too much fantasy and not enough communication. This book was just too hard to read."
3,has it high points,"good but could be better, at first, I kept going back and watching the Joe cocker tune I'll go crazy with James, it cooks. Billy Vera does a good job by himself on out of sight. robert palmer don't care for, wilson pickett not the best, aretha, not the best, also the sound could be better, I don't know why on some of these dvd's they just can't get, or mix good audio, and that wrecks it for me, unless its something historical, Black and white, and mono, thats different. two must have JB dvd's would be soul survivor, Excellent JB story, and Excellent 20 minute concert fotage, with good powerful sound, the way it should be. This dvd super soul same as & friends I don't rewatch very often, and if I do, there's only a couple of songs I go to, Joe cocker and billy vera."
4,Americana with a tragic background,"After-effects and steps taken to heal the traumas of war. Great acting, writng and directing. Serious but not at all dreary."
2,bruce willis hogs the movie...give emily some movie time,"A good attempt at post war but failed in many ways. the past faze shots are so fake its unbelieveable. ...the best post vietnam is 'born on the forth'. NOT this movie. Bruce Willis plays a Vet but the acting was overdone that it look fake. It works for DIEHARD, but not here. The part is beyond him as he tries to get all the attention, as well as screen shots. Emily Lloyd didnt get enough time thanks to the almighty bruce demand to be the center of attention. The ending is somewhat touching but the rest is boring and a waste of time. Save ur time and money by watching Born on the Forth.take care all"
5,Pride of the Island,"Alan Hahn & Peter Botte got it right with the long-awaited publication of ""Fish Sticks"".The book is a quick read--great for the plane, the beach, or just the night stand, and is filled with insider information that just doesn't make the paper.If you grew-up with the Islanders in the '70's, celebrated their four championships in the '80's, and suffered through the '90's, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.Bad owners, fake owners, new owners...relive all the calamity of the 2nd half of the 90's. The book even has a happy ending as it details the Isles' return to the playoffs in 2002.Even if you are just a hockey fan, and not an Islander fan, you'll enjoy this riches-to rags-to riches story about a team that once was, and maybe one day again will be, the ""Pride of the Island""."
4,Good.,"I dont think Irvine Welsh will ever write a book as good as Trainspotting again, hes too structured now. Porno is so slickly edited its just like any other flash new book out on the market, unlike Trainspotting which was fresh, frenetic and jumped from place to place unapologetically.Not to say this is bad, its enjoyable but not as satisfying as the original, not nearly."
2,If you love Trainspotting..,"Welsh displays a lot of weaknesses in this book. The plot is extremely contrived, the sex gets boring after a while, and while reading Nikki's parts, it feels like a guy writing from a girl's perspective rather than just the natural flow of the book. Interesting that in Trainpotting he had brilliant parts from the perspective of the young girl Nina and the Waitress and the soup. This time he tries to incorporate a major female character and while not a disaster, it doesn't work too well.Still, if you like Trainspotting, there's no reason not to read Porno. Characters like Spud, Begbie and Mark are irresistible. Almost all the characters from the first book come up again, and things have changed a lot. Leith, Dianne & Mark, Second Prize, Mark's sister-in-law, etc.Speaking of, you must read Trainspotting before this. There are so many subtle connections you will miss."
2,Very Dated,"The book's 1981 publication date doesn't indicate that this is really a post-WWII-era text. ""Offers sections on numerical control; grinding wheels (that includes the newest abrasive materials)"" is wildly optimistic, even from an 1980's perspective. If you're looking for a basic text on lathe operations, this is probably as good as any from the mid 1900s. It is certainly better than Audel's, for example, and on par with the 1950s texts that I inherited.If you're looking for a book that discusses current machine shop practice, I'd look elsewhere."
1,Stay away form this and any other RCA product!,"All the promises were false about continued support and new connectors to cell phones! Within months my new cell wasn't supported and the response from RCA was ""sorry, no plans to continue support"". It's now a piece of junk that if I could return, I would return.I rated one star since I cannot choose zero stars.RCA misled and abandoned those that bought this product and it should be remmebered when you consider RCA as a vendor. Their policies are for profit and bereft of customer support or satisfaction!Give them what they deserve - bankruptcy!Chuck"
4,One of four damaged,"One of the glasses had a chip on the inside rim, which I do not think could possibly have happened in shipping. It must have been there when it was packed. At a value of around $3, we couldn't be bothered going through the trouble of trying to send it back.The other three glasses are wonderful and we enjoy using them."
3,For diehard fans only,"All of the ""Color of Life"" skits appeared on Vols 1-3 already, and the narrator stuff bridging the skits gets old fast. The VPN-5 episode and bonus skits are pretty weak, too, but there are a few good ones here and there; this DVD has the best Zombie Family skit, for example."
1,Stay away from this item,I finished a new pantry several months ago and I'm now ordering some different kinds of organizers. This one is just bad. I'm one of those people that doesn't need to read directions and can put anything together. Not this. The problem was that it didn't have instructions. I had to go to the website to see a picture of it to help. I did get it together. I then installed it and was I not happy. The cans just don't sit nice and neat. It leans in the center. Find something else.
3,functional- but flimsy,"the wrack serves its function and fits the space I have for it.. However its of poor construction. You do have to ""put it together""- no big deal, I wouldnt put too many cans in it."
3,Not for large stockpile,"It is what it is, and you can tell from the picture that it won't hold a large number of cans! But if you need to organize a small pantry it might be ok. Next time I will pay more attention to the pictures."
5,HOMOSEXUAL UNDERCULTURE STILL PRESENT!!,"Many priests in the ""know"" have said that this book must be taken with a grain of salt. Unfortunately, they don't know how true Mr. Rose's book is. The previous review mentioned a seminary in Indiana. I happen to know for a fact that this seminary has a homosexual underculture manifested and the rector and vice-rector are indifferent and think nothing of expelling good, holy and orthodox seminarians while advancing the gay culture. Sure, they put on a good act of piety, but they demoralize, rob the dignity and integrity of the good seminarians and push the development of the ""evil"". Yes, evil is still thriving in our seminaries. I know, I have experienced it. I was a seminarian in this seminary for 2 years."
3,"Badly needed scrutiny, hampered by poor method",The validity and urgency of Mr. Rose's core argument is undermined by the doubtful way he has used and construed the evidence gathered through his research.
2,Controversial at best,One wonders at the accuracy of this portrayal. I have to think this may have been a very isolated perspective and not a universal truth.
1,Looking for someone else to blame,Michael S. Rose is a lunatic who wrote a crappy book. It doesn't make sense. How can you blame liberals for all the problems in the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church has no one else to blame but themselves. It's not the liberal's fault if a priest molests a child. The Catholic Church has no one to point to but themselves.
4,Sloppily written truth,"First, let me say what in my opinion is wrong with the book. I found the style awkward and in a couple of cases outright ungrammatical. Also, I found it to be National Enquirer-esque in tone.Yet I give it four stars! How could I have given such a not-very-well-written book such a high rating? This was a well-organized, well-researched, painstakingly honest effort. It paints a picture of the sad state of the seminary scene, starting from the ""selection process"", continuing with the tricks used to drive out men who have the capacity to be good priests. Indeed, ""Goodby, Good Men"" is the name of the game as it was (is?) played. Everything I read in this book was confirmed by first-hand accounts I have heard by men victimized by the corrupt system.This book is not fun to read. As a work of art, it doesn't cut it. But it blurts out the truth. This is a book worth reading."
1,Global sourcing made silly!,"The title of this book and the sponsorship by the Purchasing Magazine create relatively lofty expectations. Unfortunately none of the expectations are met. This book reads like a poor high school project, offers no real discussion of ""global"" elements of sourcing, and provides virtually no insights to sourcing managers."
2,Nice loking BUT....,"I have very true width EE feet and its been very difficult to find shoes that fit. Was hoping these would fit that deal and well the 6.5 fit ok but to tight at the toes do to the pointy-ness of them. So I sent them back hoping that the 7's would fit better and more comfortable well major let down to me they feel much more narrow than the 6.5s. I am debating on keeping these and just trying to break them in enough to wear them otherwise its not what I was hoping for. I have such wide but yet short feet and its so hard to find shoes that fit its ridiculous, especially when you have to spend so much money to get them. I am to young for this problem, with a low budget arthritis to boot in booth feet I am still gonna keep looking."
1,Didnt care for it,"This shoe runs about a 1/2 size small. While the narrow width was really good for me it was to small. The shoes were very stiff and hard. I wore them to work 1 day and they put a blister on one of my toes. I could not return them because I had woren them, so I gave them away.I would not buy these shoes again."
3,Ten Feet High,"Maybe this album was made for a younger audience. I did not like Andrea Corr's break from the Band she sung for. He sister Sharon, in my opinion did a better album."
2,Not worth spending money on.,"I bought this album the minute it was released... after all i'm a huge Corrs fan and simply had to buy Andrea's solo album! I didnt even sample any songs before I bought it. Huge mistake there.The album is packed with bubbly melodies and good, fun electro-pop. ... but it's TOO much. This album is so bubbly and cheerful that it comes across as cheesy with mediocre lyrics.This really isn't anything at all like the Corrs. ... except for maybe 4 or 5 songs. at the most.Honestly, if you MUST have this album. Then burn it off a friend or buy it used for really cheap."
2,What Happened to the Vocalist ?,"Most disappointing as there are too many instrumental interludes by the trio limiting Rebecca Kilgore's vocalizing. I purchased the album to hear the vocalist, not the Bobby Gordon Trio. Album should be retitled: BOBBY GORDON & TRIO PLAY MAXINE SULLIVAN w/limited vocals by Rebecca Kilgore."
5,"Brilliant, jarring. . .","Spike Lee has proven through the years to be a director of formidable talent, but not until now has he managed to tone down his showy antics and concentrate on directing in a manner that is best suited to the story he is telling. CLOCKERS is as brilliantly done as TAXI DRIVER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY or any gritty classic, certainly the best of the 'hood movies'. His charcters are desperate, complex, and the acting, uniformly excellent, especially Harvey Jietel who I thhin, gives his best performance ever. Lee and Richard Price have constructed a frighteneing, funny, sometimes heartbreaking look at black on black crime, all fashioned by Lee in a gritty, nightmarish documentarty tone. This is powerful stuff, one of the most underated films of the 90's."
3,Delroy Lindo and Harvey Keitel Shine,I like this movie. Delroy Lindo is one of the underrated talents in movies today. Harvey Keitel is really good in this too. I think this is a good story and worth a look. The only complaint is that it stinks of Spike Lee and his style. It is a little too long and has all of what has become his standard gimmicks. But still a good movie.
2,An Average Joint,"This crime drama about a troubled, confused teen boy has some well-done elements but the overall result isn`t too exciting or innovative. Strike is a young dealer living in a dangerous and claustrophobic neighborhood, and as he becomes more involved with some bad influences his problems start to increase and leaving him in a difficult situation.Director Spike Lee uses a typical murder mystery to offer some insight into this NY community, showcasing their connections and relations. There are some stylish and edgy camera angles, the acting is generally convincent and the characters complex enough (even if a bit stereotyped), but the movie is ultimately too long, the pacing slow, the plot unsurprising, the score melodramatic and the ending a bit weak and forced.So, despite some good moments, ""Clockers"" could have been more developed and edgier, since most of the picture offers nothing that hasn`t been shown in some TV series out there. Passable entertainment."
3,Synthetic book teaches synthetic philosophy,"This is one of those made-to-order books -- it does not correspond to the photo published by Amazon, and was somewhat disappointing. Why? The print is too small; and it is published by OCR software which wreaks HAVOC with spelling and punctuation.Poor quality product; only slightly better than not having it at all."
2,welllll,"Nobody likes a bad review but I just want to prepare you. This is the bleakest of the bleak postmodern Japanese novels (that I've read at least). It is full of senseless and predictable violence and self-destruction that all basically happens to prove a point -- people's bleak futures are determined by their haunting pasts. I give it 2 stars because the existence of this book balances out a lot of novels that ignore the illnesses in society -- poverty, violence, etc -- in modern Japan or even the world. The book is shocking, and to an extent this is good medicine. But I think it's overkill.I prefer, and recommend, Murakami Ryu's In the Miso Soup. It is shocking and violent as well, to be sure, but I feel more thought provoking, interesting, and a quicker read."
3,I have little to say,I bought the book mainly to have reference material on thesubject and having many other books have not read it yet.On the other hand like virtually all books from Amazon itcame quickly and was well wrapped and in good condition when I unpacked itJack
1,BAD TV AND HORRIBLE SERVICE BY SAMSUNG,I BOUGHT THIS TV IN MARCH AND AFTER 2 MONTHS IT SHUT DOWN AND NEVER WENT ON AGAIN. ITS BEING NOW 3 MONTHS AND AM STILL ON THE PHONES WITH SAMSUNG AND ITS SERVICES TRYING TO FIX MY TV.VERY VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
1,Do Not Buy This TV,"I bought the TXS3082WH model, I guess a previous model of this one, in May 2006. A friend had just bought one and it looked great, so I went out and got one too. Not too long after I purchased my set, my friends TV started acting up, same old stuff everyone else complains of, weird geometry, focus problems, etc.. Finally after 3 repair attempts and 2 replacements Samsung took back the TV and gave him credit towards an LCD.Now 11 months into my purchase, my set has totally died. I first noticed purple and green vertical stripes in dark areas of the picture about 2 months ago. Then the other night the picture distorted like it was wrapped around a balloon and after a few minutes the set just went dead, hasn't turned back on since.So now my adventure in dealing with Samsung customer service and TV repair people begins. Can't wait to see how it ends...."
4,"Misleading, but still good!","As other reviewers have said, this is definitely not 365 ""games."" But I think there are a lot of good ideas in it. In fact, I originally checked the book out of the library and now I have decided to purchase it. There are many no-brainer ideas, but I think that it offers a bit of inspiration when you may run out of ways to entertain your little ones day after day. So, misleading title yes, but worthy content nonetheless. If you are unsure, check it out of your library first!"
3,IT's alright,"I was a little disappointed when I viewed this dvd. However I stuck it in and learned the steps. Which I enjoyed. It is very basic, but the intention is to teach you a few basics then let you be creative, which is just my style. I would buy Bonnie Franklin, I hate to excercise, I love to tap, over this one. Bonnie teaches more steps and is over twice the length of this one and they are the same price. But if you want to see a more modern style than Bonnie this would be a nice addition. I own both. It is always good to have more than one source of learning."
2,Obsolete,This product does not work with the newest Wacom Cintiq 21ux. Although I believe that there is a newer one availible. It is black and Wacom lists it as model number KP400E2 under their accessories page for Cintiq 21ux.
5,I miss this movie!,I use to watch this movie all the time when I was a kid and never get sick of it. It's one of my favorite movies of the 80's. Michael Keaton was hilarious as Beetlejuice. I can't even find this movie anywhere in stores now. It could be out of stock or it could be that they are making a new DVD release to Beetlejuice. I can't wait for that one. But I hadn't seen this movie in along time and really want to see it again. I'll probably just try ordering it off Amazon then just waiting for it in stores to come. Thanks a lot to Amazon!
4,Beetlejuice,"Mike Keaton, can't imagine what his home life might have been while growing up as a child...bet he hung-out in New York like me. Beetlejuice fine work of most imagination, money, and Jewish character.Four stars."
4,Not bad... not bad at all,"This is a cute movie. About a young couple who die in a car accident and become ghosts. Then they must discourage a weird family from moving into their house, but the family's daughter soon finds out, and develops a friendship with the ghosts. Not a bad movie."
5,Classic,classic film never gets old & i always was a fan of tim burton & who was never a fan of beetlejuice
2,PG? Not!,"I loved this movie as a kid, but now ordering it for my 9 year old, I was shocked to watch it again and hear not only several profane words, but the ""f"" bomb, as well as many sexual references. I think they were a bit lax in their rating system back then-- definately more of a PG-13."
4,BEETLEJUICE..A TIM BURTON CLASSIC!,"[[ASIN:B001AGXEAG Beetlejuice (20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)]Beetlejuice, the Tim Burton classic from 1988 now comes to you packaged as a 20th Anniversary DVD edition. Michael Keaton, I think in one of his best film performances brings down the house. Also starring Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, two actors you would have never thought to put together in a movie of this genre, it is classic comedy at its best. The DVD also has special features, although nothing to make your head spin, but it offers several episodes of the cartoon series from the late 1980's. But beyond that, nothing too spectacular; not that it needs that much more. A simple classic comedy that if it doesn't make you laugh, something is wrong with you and you should be exorcised! With that being said, buy it if you don't own it. It's a must have dark comedy."
4,Great Tim Burton Classic,"This is a great halloween movie fit for the whole family though younger kids might have some problems with some scenes. Michaal Keaton, Gina Davis and Alex Baldwin are talented performers with a very good supporting cast. Burton puts just the right spin on the story."
5,Beetlejuice is Awesome,"A lot of people have seen this movie, but when watched on BlueRay the quality of the special effects seems much better. I'm not saying they re-did the CGI, but the existing CGI was cleaned up perfectly, making watching this movie a whole new experience and very pleasant to the eyes. Tim Burton used very bright colors over dull backgrounds which works quite well."
5,By far the best movie I have ever seen,"Ok I was never a big fan of Michael Keaton until they brought out this movie. He is absolutely brilliant in this along with the other stars in this ghostly comedy. Very strange in parts but that adds to our own unknow thinking of what actually happens when we die. Great music that you can sing a long to. So go out and buy this movie, you won't be disappointed!"
5,"""Ach deliver me from LL Bean.""","This was my favorite movie as a kid and still I can watch it a million times more. Funny, dark and one of Michael Keaton's best movies'."
5,this movie is awesome,"The movie is absolutely funny!! I would recommend for everyone to get this movie. It has a good plot about it and all the twist to make it one of the funniest movies out there. So those of you that have not seen this movie, you need to see it now, because if not, you are really missing out."
5,A Must-Own Classic,This is one of those movies I consider a modern classic. Good clean fun for the whole family with lots of memorable scenes. The price was unbeatable too!
3,A Modern Day Classic,"Beetlejuice is a wonderful blend of the macabre, a skewering of YUPPIE materialism, Questions about the afterlife and the concept of happiness as a by-product of living, all in a comic blend of the sly and the crude with the glue being Michael Keaton in the title role. Worth seeing, worth owning."
5,cal mag,been using and a great product and would recommend to everyone. Better than store bought products. calcium is better absorbed
4,Recently bought,"This series is amazing with plenty of things to keep any sci-fi fan entertained. Amazon shipped the product fast even with the super shipping option I still got it in the same time as I would have with regular shipping. The only problem that I had was when I received the box in one the top corners it was ripped. It looks as if it happened sometime during the shipping of the series but none of the cases are damaged, the dvd's work great and the box saves an amazing amount of space still."
4,Great show if you expect Hercules in space,"Andromeda is a great series, its an interesting concept that makes for good entertainment. If you go in with the mindset of Hercules in space, you won't be disappointed. Especially for the price, definately worth watching."
3,Not his best but still is worth it.,"I enjoyed his earlier stuff on these CD's. I too think ""VOL.4"" in the Bootleg Series is better (Live 1966).But it is always worth getting the whole collection in the series."
1,How disappointing - shame on Amazon,"I've been purchasing this brand, size, type of agave from amazon for about 2 years. The price fluctuates, that's fair. Now however, the price has increased another $2 - again that's fair, but instead of ""12 bottles it's 6 bottles for the price of 12"". Unbelievable!I truly hope this is a mistake and that it's resolved quickly - otherwise, shame on Amazon..."
3,Packaging?,"What is going on with Amazon's packaging? When I first started purchasing this item a while back, they would shrink wrap the entire set of 12 bottles together before putting them in the box. Now, it seems as though they just throw them in there. A few of the bottles leaked. It wasn't a crazy amount of leakage, but is it really that much more difficult to send these things through the shrink wrapper before shipping them to ensure that they arrive without this problem? This is still a good product. It's still at a price that's cheaper than I could get in the stores, but it won't be worth it if I don't get what I ordered, because half of it has leaked out. The product itself gets 5 stars, but Amazon's packaging really leaves a lot to be desired these days. 3 stars overall."
5,Wonderful sweetener,"I am so pleased with Madhava's raw, organic agave nectar. The flavor is light, the sweetness is much healthier than sugar, and it's easy to use. When I baked with it, I just lowered the heat in the oven by 25 degrees F, and cut all the liquids by 1/3. It's great on pancakes and French toast -- even diluted with a bit of water because it has the consistency of honey. This is great pricing as well!"
1,Great cover...shame about the music,This cd was one of the biggest dissapointments of my music buying life. It is formulaic funk jam music with none of the Transglobal Underground magic that usually permeates their work...almost as if it was a poor cover band trying to be TGU...the sound of a band treading water. Every album prior to this I would have happily given 4-5 stars but this barely warrants the one. Although Natacha Atlas isn't the sole reason Tansglobal Underground have been so great in the past her presence/influence is sorely missed here.
5,***P.M.W.-Original and creative...5 Stars***,"With production comming from the Neptunes you can fell the heat already. The Neptunes are all over this one, producing 11 out of the 18 tracks including the smash hit ""Please Don't Mind."" Bonic and Mr take this album to a whole new level with crazy lyrics and off the wall beats.My favorite tracks are ""Please Don't Mind,"" ""Ladies Choice,"" ""Dream Car,"" and ""Suckas pt. 2""Also take a listen to to ""Ya'll can't never hurt us,"" ""This B***h"" and also both the versions of ""Cross The Border"" are also good tracks.The skits on this album are good but my favorite is ""Piece Of The Pie."" It's very creative and keeps your attention. Overall, this album along with Foxy's new one are 2 of the best to be released in a while. Check this album out!U CAN TURN THE MIC DOWN A LIL BIT......."
5,Screwball Comedy at Its Funniest!,"You will never love Barbra Streisand more in any other film than ""What's Up, Doc."" This ""Love Story"" is a treasure chest of pop-cultural referencesand classic comedians who should never be forgotten. Screwball comedy has never been more believable or entertaining than in this Streisand classic. Let the carrots for Bugs and Babs, butter the popcorn and laugh your way through an afternoon of comedic history."
5,Whats Up Doc is funny as HELL,This movie is still one of the funniest films ever made. If you need a good laugh this is the movie to see.
5,Great Fun,This comedy is a classic. Fast moving and very funny. Ryan O'Neal is great as the straight man to Barbara Streisand's wackyness. Watch for Madelyn Kahn as the girlfriend. Just see if you can keep up with the plaid satchels. Very clever and very funny.
1,What did all these other people see in this movie,"I have no idea what these other reviewers see in this movie, it is awful. I mean, I love Barbara Streisand, but this is unwatchable! I gave up after about 40 minutes."
4,The Process,"An interesting book that uses wide horizons. Gysin filled it with allusion, hints and tricks. It's words seem to be carefully placed. It was designed, apparently, to read the reader. It might be more than a novel or it might not. The Process is stylish, clever and possibly very important. I felt that the haze created was frustrating and entertaining, I wanted more details."
3,Huge Bang Tango Fan Hoped For More,"This is by no means a bad cd. In fact I think it's quite good and better than most of the stuff that I hear today. However, I think that Bang Tango was a far better band and even more underrated.This cd has the same ferocity as BT but I don't think the songs are as strong. And I truly miss Kyle Kyle!!! That being said, this is a talented group and the guitar on this cd is killer. I miss a good solo and guitar thrashing. Joe Leste has an amazing voice too. I'm glad he's still with us.Beautiful Creatures are on the same playing field as Brides Of Destruction. Both are good bands with a great raunchy sound. I still have high hopes for a new cd by BC."
2,"I'm sorry, but not close to Jane Eyre!","Lucy seems to be a somewhat schizophrenic character that you just cant get a handle on. There is nowhere near the empathy for her as some of Bronte's other heroines. The French drove me crazy and I think was only self-serving for Bronte's obvious intellect. There was never the heart rending compassion for any character in this book and although the writing was probably superior to Jane Eyre, the lack of plot and empathetic characters rates this one a dud!"
4,Wish Kindle had language translation ...,"I liked the book. There is a lot of french and I really, really wish that you could highlight the words and kindle would give you a translation. Missed out on alot in this book because of it. Just saying....."
4,Bear,The bear came in an opened 8 by 11 manila envelope. Lucky me it was clean and arrived safe. Better packing was needed for 20.00
5,Not just a Mormon flick,"While marketed and generally reviewed as a Mormon movie, or at best a Christian film, ""Baptists at Our Barbecue"" can stand on its own as a well-told tale of small-town life. In the same vein as ""Northern Exposure"" (including a great, eclectic soundtrack, btw) or Tom Bodett's tales, ""Baptists"" does revolve around religion - but in the same way ""Northern Exposure"" revolved around Joel Fleishman being a New Yorker stuck in Alaska. One need not be Mormon nor Baptist (lapsed Catholic here) to enjoy this film's excellent character development, large cast of lovable eccentrics, or strong story telling."
4,Dan Merkley Dan Merkley Dan Merkley,"The glue that held this together and kept it going is the lead Dan Merkley, who apparently has had no other significant movie role. He's warm and compelling and just a joy to look at. The movie itself is a fun 90 minutes, lots of physical humor, lots of situational humor, and a plot that is not fully predictable. Cute minute after the credits, too."
2,Corny,Boring and not well written. Not well made. Not well acted. Wasted if time. You should find something else to watch.
1,"Awful - bad acting, bad script and insulting to Baptists and Mormons","The only way this movie could have been successful is if they just expect every Mormon to go see a movie about Mormons. There are really no good redeming qualities about the movie. The script is horrible, the acting is worse and I thought it was very offensive to both Baptists and Mormons and for that matter anyone with a brain cell.Just a quick thrown together movie that they'd hope to make a quick buck on expecting every Mormon to watch it/buy it because the subject is about Mormons (and Baptists).This movie is so bad that it made my top ten list for movies I have ever had the displeasure of enduring."
4,Tony Bennett's all time hits,Great CD of Tony Bennett. Selection is excellent and the sound quality is good considering it was old records. I am very happy with it.
5,No wonder Tony was The Chairman?s Favorite Singer!,"This CD is simply amazing. Tony has enormous vocal range and excellent phrasing. Like Sinatra, one believes every word he sings. No wonder he was The Chairman's fave crooner. Listen for yourself. The remastering job is first rate. My favorite tracks: ""Love Look Away"", ""Who can I turn to"", ""Stranger in Paradise"", ""Maybe this Time"" and of course his signature tune ""I left my Heart in San Francisco""."
4,Holy Crap... How Was This Overlooked?,"So i started downloading this cd back in mid 2004. I heard thog, drain, smoking hole, and killing direction. Those songs blew me away. Yeah its not the old Gray Matter. So what? I ended up finding it at gray whale last december and I was way happy. The only place they went wrong was with 'ive just seen a face'. Thats a gay beatles song and probably a worse gray matter song, but the rest are great. Pick this up."
5,Wacom pen,"I was so jazzed to find a replacement pen for my tablet. Tablet and pen are in constant use and have been for several years. They are great little work horses and I literally can't live without them. The pen started to go on the fritz after years of being used, dropped, chewed on by my cat, sat on, etc. Price was fair as well. Hiding this one from Mr. Kitty."
1,not what i ordered.,"this was advertised wrong. it is not the grip pen, but the classic pen instead. i ordered the grip pen, NOT the skinny classic pen. very disspointed."
5,A Wonder Re-release of a dynamite recording,"""Christmas Carols for Solo Guitar"" is one of the best of seasonal albums. We purchased the original in 1966. It is a sleeper but the religious message helps retain the spiritual nature of the holiday. Thanks for bringing it out on disc after all these years!"
3,Worth a Try,"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review. Attorney Lou Mason is caught in a tangle of deception as he attempts to defend a troubled young woman (Jordan Hackett) accused of double murder. Multiple suspects are found and none fit just right except Jordan. I agree with what another reviewer said about this book, ""I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight as Goldman introduced them at a rapid-fire pace, resulting in many character sketches but few fully realized personalities."" The main story was interesting enough but the ending was a surprise. Not usually my type of book, but worth the read."
2,BORROW IT IF POSSIBLE,"I recently became interested in sculpture and this book caught my attention thinking it would teach me the basics. My uncle happened to have this book in his stash so I borrowed it. This book has about four pages of reading material, it doesn't really say much about the tools or materials needed for sculpting, it just shows you a few that the sculptor uses. The book is full of pictures where you can see the progress from start to finish of the sculpture depicted on its cover, however it doesn't demonstrate how or which tools were used to achieve such finish. It is obvious that the sculptor is very talented and has a solid knowledge of anatomy which is the only thing I liked about the book because you can see what can be accomplished with this medium."
2,Please improve this Product,"Thses types of gloves do not hold up well. Not only this brand, but the others also. They need to be made without the rubber type material, and made with the other material on both sides. The rubber splits at the seams. However, they are better than nothing. Product materials need to be improved"
1,terrible,"Not my cup of tea, it really wasn't a work out, just a series of extremely confusing steps that has you jumping around and guessing. No one step was stuck with long enough to be effective. It wasn't a good workout."
3,"Jazz, Blues and Moore","Here, Dudley shows his mastery of every Jazz cliche in the book, including his great imitation of Errol Garner. Some riffs a little ingratiating, but evidence of Dudley's formidable classical talent creeps in to help. A 3.5."
3,A short history... perhaps too short,"This book was the text used for an Italian culture class I recently took as a requirement for my Italian minor. While it was full of information, I felt that some topics were just skipped over. The Colosseum earns an entire sentence, yet Caravaggio, perhaps the most famous and adored of Italian Baroque painters (the Italians so honored him by printing his picture on the L100,000 note) does not even get a mention. Granted it must have been challenging to cover over 3000 years of civilization in 300 pages, but it just seems like this book skips over too much. If you want a chronology of Italy, this is the book for you, but if you want detailed information into the history of Italy, you may want to look elsewhere."
4,I dig early Miles,"Well, this isn't that early, but it was tastefully done. Hey, Miles could do no wrong! Right? This is epic stuff, history, cool and very, very New York. If you watched the PBS spew on Jazz, you got a brief introduction of the mood, the timeframe and the events cascading all around the artists of Jazz. That little peek at their world can sometimes open up the music and the groove or feeling that went with it. Anyway... Miles was pure gold during this one. I dig it better than Sketches but, I dig Sketches too."
5,As good as it gets!,"This masterpiece of an album is definitely among Miles' best. As if the title track wasn't reason enough to buy this CD, Davis throws in five more top notch tracks. Miles solos well throughout, and this is complimented well by Hank Mobley. Coltrane's solo on the opening number is priceless. Don't miss out on this album, buy it."
1,Not worth my time!,"As a recovering addict, I feel this approach to be a quater messure at best and only treating a part of the disease. Unless I treat all the disease I can not recover. If I could give this book no stars I would."
5,Very good film,"This is one of those great movies that's also dark and a bit depressing.You don't need me to go into another detailed account of what this flick was about, so I won't. See the movie, it's about a kid with a screwed up dad that figures out how to make it in life, only he the choice he makes leads to a life of crime and running.In the end there is some redemption, so the movie besides having a great cast and an interesting story to does have a message there too.I don't know if this is one to own, how many times can it be entertaining to watch I don't know, but it's definately worth seeing once."
2,A complete bore to the end....,"This film was very drawn out and there were some very unecessary parts in there that if they would have left out...we still would have gotten the jist of the film. I have to say that DiCapprio's performance is great...along with Tom Hanks...two great actors, that unfortunatley got caught up in a sleeper of a film!"
4,Supremely entertaining,"Shallow to it's core, Catch Me If You Can is still a supremely entertaining visual blast courtesy of Steven Spielberg. Leonardo DiCaprio steals the show as teenage con-man Frank Abignale Jr., on the run from FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) as he continues unbelieveable impersonations one right after the other. Were it not for the excellent, dynaminte cast and Spielberg's visual flair, Catch Me If You Can could have been disasterous, but the performances from DiCaprio, Hanks, and Christopher Walken in an Oscar nominated role as Frank's father (he is undoubtadly the highlight of the film) make the film much better than it should be. Also starring Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo, and look for TV's Angel star Amy Acker in a small role."
4,Portrait of a con man,"This movie is based on the life of Frank Abagnale Jr., an infamous con man who successfully pretended to be an airline pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer. When his beloved parents divorced, he ran away from home and lived by his wits, eventually developing techniques which enabled him to impersonate a man who had the credentials for several different occupations and who was able to cash bad checks all over the world. Leonardo DiCaprio turns in a smooth performance as Abagnale and he upstages Tom Hanks who is stuck in the role of a humorless FBI agent with a bad Boston accent. My husband heard Abagnale speak 30 years ago, and remembers his life much the way it is depicted in the movie. This is an enjoyable movie and an interesting look at a man who became whoever he wanted to be just by using his wits and charm."
2,Zzzz,"Very disappointing. First problem: casting. DiCaprio does an adequate job as the precocious criminal, but simply doesn't possess the cunning or bluster to be a credible high-stakes con man. Tom Hanks gives (for once) a highly inconsistent performance, one minute confused and discombobulated and the next minute cool and calculating. Christopher Walken tries hard as DiCaprio's hard-luck father, but is too chilly to evoke the sympathy Spielberg apparently wants us to have for him. Second problem: direction. The story could have been told better. Starting at the end takes away much of the suspense. A little suspense might have kept the audience interested; as it is, the movie does not seem to know when to end, but you already know what happens, and that adds up to boredom."
4,catch me if you can,",h am ajapanese university student and I watched""CATCH ME IF YOU CAN"".This movie is thrilling and comic.This episode is half an existing genius fraud's life.he was a fraud when he was teenager.But he was gone after by a man of FBI.I thought the show was human warmth because an exciting of views between two men is very good.I would recommend this movie because it is very fun and human warmth is very emotional."
2,Entertaining UNLESS you've read the book!,"I read this book before the movie came out, and Spielberg butchered the great story. The movie omits many of the best stories in the book, or twists and abuses them into inoffensive fluff, wrenching away their original intrigue. Spielberg confabulated a relationship between the lead and the FBI agent to make a better story, but it made both characters seem like woebegone fools.HOWEVER, my friends who didn't read the book tended to like it.I recommend you read the book instead--it's the first book in years that I couldn't put down until I had finished it. But if you don't like to read, then feel free to watch the movie and you probably won't be dissapointed."
3,Catch the book instead.,"'Catch Me If You Can' is perfectly fine, watchable stuff. However the book upon which this film is based is far more thrilling and entertaining. Frank W. Abagnale has a fascinating story to tell though it comes off a little flat on screen and loses some of the books finer details. By rights Spielberg should have us on the edge of our seats, and though it's enjoyable enough I can't help but feel it had the potential to be greater."
5,One the Best movies ever made,"I saw this movie back in 2003 when it first came out in the movie theaters. In my opinion it is one the best movies ever made and one of my favorites. Over the years I've watched it many many times. I've probably seen it at least 25 times already. I still enjoy watching it even though I've seen so many times. There's not one boring moment in the movie. It's not slow moving at all. It's got a great story which is based on a true one. It has a great cast and producer, director. It's got comedy, drama, romance and action. It makes you think and the movie leaves a lasting impression on you. If you haven't seen this movie yet then I strongly urge you to watch it. I wish this movie was available in blu ray form. That's my only gripe about it."
4,A Great Story,"2002 was a great year for Steven Speilberg- as a follow-up to the brilliant Minority Report, he had Catch Me If You Can, the story of a teenage con-man who impersonated a doctor, pilot, and lawyer for years while dodging the FBI. Oh yeah, he only made a couple million bucks too.But in this end this movie is ultimately about families- specifically, a divorced family. It shows the effect of seperation and death, and what that can lead some people to do.Catch Me If You Can is just a plain, all around, fun movie.Plus the special features are informative and really give you a sense of why this film was made, and how things went."
4,My Review,I really loved the book and the movie totally did it justice. Leonardo DiCaprio is awesome and so was Tom Hanks. I bought this movie so of course its good.
4,THE BAD CHECK'S IN THE MAIL,"This film builds in entertainment value as it skips merrily along and possesses an unnerving quality, sure to upset the con in all of us, regarding true life famed forger Frank Abagnale Jr. being globally cornered and doggedly pursued by a determined and obsessed FBI agent. Director Steven Spielberg pictures an upscale, conservative and gaudy side of the 1960s, and DiCaprio is more than convincing as the gifted scam artist, who as Spielberg suggests, is only trying to find his way back home. Clever and amusing ""Pink Panther"" -like musical score by John Williams helps keep this criminal act a light-hearted affair."
1,Very dissapointing,"I felt the essence of the book was destroyed , Leo was terrible , very very dissapointing."
2,Sucked,"I have to be honest, everything about the movie sucked! The so called hot guy was NOT hot, the only good thing about the movie was the cute black guy."
4,Saving your son sometimes means sacrifice,"Deception and manipulation is the world of the young hustler, who is used by his most intimate family. His loyalty toward those he trusts is the pivot point in this film. The boy is looking for his father's love and gets a big surprise, which makes his life and death decision all the more poignant."
1,A sad excuse for a movie,"Just check online for RELIABLE critiques or reviews. The company that made this movie has a habit of writing fake critiques to try to hype it up. But anyone with half a brain can pick them out. Pathetic.Where's the ""0 stars"" option? Oh well, I guess a ""1"" will do."
1,Disappointed,This shovel didn't come with an extra handle as advertized. The handle is also pulpwood and the hand handle is plastic. For the money I am disappointed with my purchase.
3,Software needs improvement,"The concept of this program is excellent, however there are some serious shortcomings in the software. Once you enter a song in the compose mode and then go into the sing mode and sing with it you can no longer go back to the compose mode to edit the song with out changing it's title. Also if you enter a song in a given key, save it, there is no option to allow you to open it up in the original key - the program automatically changes the key to fit your voice and if that's not where you want it, the onus is on you to remember the key in which you entered it if you want to reset it back to that key. An extensive tutorial would be a welcome improvement."
3,Singing Coach Unlimited,"It is really geared for children, and is not really flexible to allow someone to customize it for their own needs, - at least so far, it is too pedestrian"
1,disappointed,"THis product is not at all as I expected. THe one I used previously was easy to use and had over 100 songs in it's library. This product does not track the voice well, even for the teacher!! I am so sorry to have purchased it!"
3,Singing Coach Unlimited,"Good overall product. Gives adequate feedback of your performance.Shortcomings-Cannot import MIDI files with multiple time signatures which is something I really needed.When recording your voice on a longer song, the music display does not keep up with your voice input.Can't turn off the verbal help when revisiting a lesson. Gets annoying to have to listen over and over to the introduction to a section rather than being able to simply do the lesson."
1,Not the right one!,"This may work for the carb version of the 2002, but is not meant for the tii. The fuel pressure is much higher and you really need the one with a metal can."
2,Ridiculous expose on the diva...,"Nutty, baffling, sometimes hilariously over-the-top collection of stories on Barbra Streisand's infamous impatience, impertenance, uber perfection and all-around bad temper. Author Shaun Considine, having been present on the sets of Barbra's movies ""Up The Sandbox"" and ""A Star Is Born""--which seems to be the closest he ever got to her--writes about the star as if he knows her first-hand. Many of his gossipy tidbits are suspect, others merely juvenile and/or taken out of context. When the star complains, ""No one really cares"", she's saying this on the set of a movie, on-location in sweltering Arizona, trying to get an indifferent director to see her vision and contend with a stadium full of screaming fans. Considine never considers the dynamic results of Streisand's hard work, only on how she cracked under the pressure to get it right."
3,Stainless Steel Martini Glasses,"Based on object description, seemed to be a fitting gift for a friend who uses a lot of stainless steel and aluminum in their decor. However, the construction of the goblets doesn't match it's description. Upon receipt of the items, the boxes were wrapped and not another tho't was given to them until friend unwrapped their gifts. The 1st of the 2 sets to be opened, revealed the broken goblet (the other goblet inside was fine). The 2nd of the 2 boxes was opened and the contents were as they should be... intact. Just am not sure if they are designed for use and are for the purpose described. Maybe they are best suited as simple ""objet d'art"". Not functional goblets since too much care is necessary to insure they don't snap into. Their durability remains to be seen."
2,Not that great- Cheaply made.,I purchased stainless steal martini glasses before from a manufacture called Danesco and they were Awesome. These Oggi glasses are not at all of the same quality. they screw on top and are real crooked. They are not very good in my opinion. Cheaply made.
1,RIP OFF!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"These glasses ar total pieces of crap... The arrived broken where the stem meets the base... I used them one time to make one martini, and they rusted after the first hand wash. I am very dissappointed and feel totally ripped off. When i tried to send them back for a return, amazon projected the refund to take 2 months to process.. For the money, it is not even worth the headache.... They are poorly made in china and are not worth the box they come in.... Maybe ill use the box as a glass, at least it wont give me tetnus......"
2,No thanks...,Sorry. It's just hard for me to take any kind of spiritual direction from somebody who was an admirer of the SS seriously.
4,Funny and Entertaining,I enjoyed reading this book. The main character was entertaining and gaining a new spiel on the generation X audience. A good book to read on cold wintery day.
1,Pirate,"Warning-pirate copies,the original company Casablanca Record never has made in cd the lp's vinyls of Love & Kisses,only Unidisc of Canada did a greatest hits,Beware when see,Import,Russian etc."
2,From tight to alright,"I'm sure everyone will agree with me when I say 2000 Fold was tight!! This new cd, 'Megadef'....what happened? They went from not needing to talk about stupid things while not using profanity which showed (past tense) how tight this group is...to, now they changed their style...do they have to prove somehting to someone? Did they sell out to some record producer who said they have to use profanity? I'm a Christian and the first album is far different from this new one. I was promoting their styles to the Christian community, showing that a secular group doesn't need to say 'junk' to be good. I can't do that now...they really disapointed me...Styles of Weakness...Styles of Sell-Outs"
5,outstanding,"To be honest, I have not yet heard the CD versions of Jerry's songs, but I own all of them on vinyl -- the mastering of sounds through CD- technology should only enhance them for the great enjoyment for those in love"
3,Not bad,"This is an old book. If you are stressed out or have been lately in your life I do recommend you read this. Most of the stuff is common sense but there was some new information that was new to me, and useful. Good price so do buy."
1,This should have been a Pamphlet,"I slogged through the volume looking for the ""How to do it"", yet most of the book was all about the history of meditation, various forms of meditation and so on. The actual purpose of the book took at most 2 pages. Then it was not explained in great detail, but just superficially. I would recommend this as a Pamphlet."
4,Good Book,"It's a very easy reading book. I am actually writing a dissertation on how meditation reduces anxiety. This book is the starter and is very helpful. It's just good to know that an ancient method is been scientifically proven and accepted in western world. Also, a Harvard Medical Doctor and Professor, an authority figure, writing about it is just real convincing. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends. Sometimes I just wish he does more study on meditation specifically for concentration, and other kinda effects."
3,Wake me when it is over...,"I read a brief synop about this movie several years ago in a movie industry magazine and thought it sounded interesting. I anxiously awaited its release.Years of anticipation, waiting eagerly for the release of a film starring a load of talented actors, about a fascinating, turbulent time in history were for NAUGHT.This movie was an utter, utter disappointment. With a score of fantastically talented actors (Everett, Roth, Scott), a riveting plot (revoultion and regicide - come on!), and an interesting setting, this movie still sunk like a lead balloon.Slow. Ponderous. Impressed with it's weight. Bogged down with poorly written dialogue. Lacking deft characterizations that would make this a compelling story, or at the very least, something to keep you from clicking the DVD off and tuning instead to a rerun of The Tudors.In short, after years of waiting, I am left miserably diappointed."
2,Nicce gift for 50th anniversary,"I got a lovely thank you note from the recipiant! She loved it! Thank you, Judy"
4,Start changing your thinking about Fodd Today!,Linda does a fantatic job at cultivating understanding of what might REALLY be going on in regards to cravings and food choices. It was very useful!
2,Entirely Dissapointing,"Morning sci-fi is a dissapointing sophomore effort that lacks everything that was good about the first one. It is essentially a mind-numbingly dull hour of progressive breaks and angsty vocals. The strings are gone, the vocals are gone and so are the intricately designed break beats of the first album.While the first album was an amazing combination of nu-school breaks and epic trance, this album is simply progressive breaks. I will not go into how pointless progressive breaks are, I will just finish this review with a simple statement.Appallingly mediocre."
5,Movie soundtrack for walking through an awesome museum,"Absolutely singular. A true album experience and definitely the breaks companion to the amazing AirDrawnDagger by Sasha. A correctly executed and entrancing offering from a group that has made a name for itself as a soundtrack-writing duo from the UK. This CD might as well be a soundtrack with its powerful track selection as well as its sensation of being a ""whole album"" experience. No single track feels like it can be exclusive from each other. You should listen to this as one long song.Although not my favorite Hybrid album, this is still innovative and spectacular."
2,Another award winner?,"Why are these sorts of ""post-colonial"" book becoming the new divine mead which critics are so greedily slurping up? This is far from revolutionary writing and tries to mask its shallowness with a fragmented narrative. Her writing presents nothing more than an almost reflexive litany on race. The author assumes the presentation of these ideas with graphic candor shall make us acquiesce to the shocking depravity of history (whilst at the same time allowing the subconscious pat on the back for our liberalism and moral advancement). The book itself lacks any true insight and gives way to the most rancid sort of exhibitionism, which I personally have come to expect from this new breed of post-colonial author. For readers, try ""Lonely Londoners"" by Sam Selvon if you're interested."
5,Great Read!,Levy does a wonderful job of evoking England and the Caribbean mid-20th century. The mix of intriguing personal narratives and explosive racial politics makes this book hard to put down.
5,Small book has quite a punch,"I often wonder when I read other reviews of a book I either loved or hated if we read the same one. The book I read was anything but lifeless and mediocre. This book pulsed with life, with rage, with injustice, with destruction, and finally, with love. Levy's three main characters came to life for me on the page. What happened to them made me angry at the same time that they made me laugh or cry. While I could have done without Bernard's time in India, the thread of the story between two islands and two couples wove right up through the twist and the ending.Not only was this a good read, it was a good lesson. I knew about the discrimination of Blacks by the US armed forces in WWII. I had no idea it was the same if not worse in the RAF. And while I knew about the Blitz, I didn't really know, until reading Levy's description of it.Highly recommended. I'll definitely read her other books."
4,Great Film -- but I think it's cut!?,"If I remember the movie right (from an early VHS) there is ascene where Marvin in burned by Borgnine with hot steam fromthe train's engine. Did I miss it, or why is Marvin's shoulderburned all of a sudden. If the movie is cut it's a shame afterall this waiting for a DVD."
3,good hobo movie,"this is an entertaining enough 'bo movie,with a nice gritty sense of realism initially,then a fairly exciting action end to it.i wont bother with going over the plot in too much detail,basically a hobo wants to ride a train,which the train conductor says specifically NO HOBOS.he has a sign and everything....well,not really.but it is a great hobo movie,see ""hobos christmas"" for how NOT to make a hobo movie.3 out of 5,hardly a classic but good fun all the same."
4,Emperor of the North,"Ernie Borgnine and Lee Marvin duke it out with 2x4s, chains, hammers and a fire axe in this action-adventure which takes place almost entirely on trains! A great character study of he-men ridn' the rails."
3,"Good, slow routines for beginners in yoga.","Lilias explains everything she is doing as she is doing it. This makes it very easy to follow along, although after watching the video repeatedly, it gets kind of old to listen to. The routines are about 20 minutes long and relaxing."
3,Average movie,"Rather strange plot, with a somewhat predictable ending, and exaggerated acting by Whoppi. Few laughs. Woudl not really recommend watching"
1,one down five to go,Bought the PacTool International SS424 Backerboard Shear hoping to speed the six homes up our Church Group was re-building in Bastrop TX after last falls wild fires. The head fell off on the first house. What a waste of time and money. Hope other people have better results.
2,Ray not at his best !,A bit flat and lacking that Barretto temperature; some good percussion but certainly not Ray's best.
5,In the time tunnel,Chocolate Chip was one of our fav albums back in my college years (late '70s). I've been searching for it ever since. I think it's one of Issac's very best.
4,Isaac's transition from soul to disco.,"On this 1975 release, Isaac Hayes made a transition from soul to disco. Not as essential or as artistically substantial as his Stax releases but its production values are solid and it has the right blend of ballads and disco tracks."
2,Couldnt get it to repeat wi-fi signals,"I spent many hours trying to get the D-Link to work as a repeater but failed. Had to return to Amazon. I have 25 years experience with computers, and I'm frustrated enough with the experience that I'm going to wait six months and look for a new product to rebroadcast my local wi-fi signal through my house."
2,"not very super--(it was named ""Super-Rake"" so that was clever)","Steel rakes are heavy but aluminum ones break tines so I went for heavy. The super rake avoids being very heavy by having thin, widely spaced, uncurved tines that I disliked, though not enough to return it. It will let larger stones through than other rakes and I can't pull embedded stones from the soil very easily but it will scratch up hard soil enough to seed with grass and can spread loose topsoil and gravel quickly with its three foot width. The ""long handle"" isn't any longer than a standard garden rake and overall I wish I bought another model of extra-wide steel rake but I'll make do with this one for the rare occasions I need it."
2,What happened?,"I've known the guys in Throcult for years. The guy who wrote the other review is wrong. The old bassist (Cassie) didn't take over vocals. In fact, she's not even in the band anymore. It was the lead guitarist Ivan who took over vocals. And they are a three-piece band now, not a four piece band. Anyhow, with the loss of the original vocalist, the keyboardist, one guitarist, and the change of drummers, Throcults sound got really weak. If you compare Stormbringer to Soldiers of a Blackened War, you'll notice that the guitar work is much more refined on the older disc, and the old vocals mesh a whole lot better with the music than do the newer ones."
2,Brian,"Very thin, flimsy material. You can tear it just getting it opened up and stretched out. I was frustrated and disappointed"
1,Rubbish!,"Just when music couldn't get any worse,along comes ""Bat out of Hell II"".Great-MORE noise to give you a worse migraine than before.There is NO talent and NO music in this rubbish album-it's just a bunch of noise,noise,noise,noise,noise,noise,noise-and did I mention noise?Meatloaf have proven to the world that he is one of the absolute WORST musicians of all time.DO NOT waste your money on this album unless you want to get a lifetime prescription of migraine medication."
3,Good music but...,"The music on the CD is defiantly a A Bat Out Of Hell Series Classic but the overall quality of the sound is sad; I felt as if my Bose 501 speakers had a bowl of Rice Krispies inside and as soon as I played the Bat Out Of Hell 3 their was a noticeably pleasant sound coming from the speakers;Quality!each Cd was purchased from Amazon,NEW..."
1,Not again!,Amazing that people fell for this tripe a second time. Can anyone tell this one and BOFH I apart? This should have been left back in the 70's where it belongs.
5,Meat Loaf - The God of Rock & Roll,"Meat Loaf was the first rock star that I was obsessed about. The reason for that obsession was this incredible album ""Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell."" I loved every song on the album from start to finish and actually wore out my cassette (hey! It was 1993) and had to buy a new one!"
4,Best Liquid Hoodia in the World is Potent Hoodia -- 5 (FIVE) Stars,"Though I lost the bulk of my 97 (and counting!) excess pounds with Hoodoba PURE Hoodia capsules, I sometimes use the faster-acting Potent Hoodia when I crave more-rapid appetite suppression or can't wait at least 35 minutes before eating for the capsules to ""kick in."" Of the three Hoodia liquids I've tried, Hoodoba Potent Hoodia gives me the longest and deepest appetite suppression.Potent Hoodia suppresses my appetite at least 3x better than the only other 500 mg/ml Hoodia liquid on the market. Except for when I need the ultra-rapid suppression that Hoodoba Potent Hoodia provides, I still prefer chewing Hoodoba PURE Hoodia capsules. But among Hoodia liquids, Hoodoba Potent Hoodia is the most effective and best value (5 out of 5!) of any Hoodia liquid I've ever tried."
4,A Family Classic,"I grew up listening to this album every Christmas, and I can't imagine the holidays without it! If you like good old guitar and vocals with harmony, this is a great album to add to your holiday collection. Perfect for those evenings in front of the fire."
4,"Wonderful on legends, stories, perfumers, houses, packaging, and everything about perfume, but a bit light on the scents . . .","This is a beautiful book and a great read on the legends and stories behind the great perfumes and perfume houses. I learned more about the perfumes, the packaging, the designers, the design culture in France, etc. etc. etc. than I ever would have expected. There are some pretty good descriptions of the scents themselves, together with triangle diagrams of head, heart and bottom notes.I would have liked to see more ""how to buy perfume"" information, such as the different formulations of EDT, EDP, etc., and maybe some more comparative information on the various fragrances.This book has been an invaluable resource for my blog, [...]"
5,The most complete Saarinen book,"Beautifully and incisively illustrated, full of contemporary comments and criticism by colleagues and critics, a solid biography of both Eero and Elial Saarinem, the author of this book illuminates and informs all streams of his important life and work. Readable and full of detail, this book is a great way to get to know Saarinen, and to know him very well."
2,And you thought the Brothers were Grimm,"I kept falling asleep when I was reading this--and all I can remember now, its been a year. Is how weird I found it. It kept giving me weird ideas, that perhaps the author would have loved to seen Sleeping Beauty as a porno flick instead of a fairy tale.Strange, strange book. Though it certainly has some unique ideas in it.This is a really dark book, even if it is amazingly short."
3,"Tedious, Boring, Brilliant?","As I read this book for a college class on fairy tales, I began to realize what Coover was doing: throwing out narrative for an exploration of destiny, fairy tales, dreams, story, and relationship to the reader. By the end of the short book, I totally hated it. So what do I do? I read it again. That's right, I'm drawn back to this meticulous piece of boredom. I guess that means the book is either brilliant or such a beautiful car wreck I have to make a U-turn to take a second look."
3,Bug Deflector for Nissan Titan,"Put this on my 2010 Nissan Titan Crew Cab SE. Almost a perfect fit, only covers the middle part of the hood. This deflector does not cover the outside flares of the hod and with a bit more design could have made a bit better product. So far it does the job, keep rocks off the hood from chipping the paint, keep bugs flying happily over the windshield and helps a bit with snow in the winter.. The construction is typical of any other bug deflector. It is the drill type and 4 sheet metal screws are provided which i found you will need to drill a small pilot hole to be sure to get them started. Be sure to place the rubber bumpers on the shield itself and not on the hood as the instructions say to. the smoke finish looks great on my truck. I wold recommend this shield to those who don't mind not having a full hood deflector, but there are otehrs out there that provided for full coverage but cost a lot more. Great product for the price."
3,Needs a Little Help,Spent last night assemblying and mounting the rack to my 2004 Camry sedan. The gutter hooks that attach to the inner door frame kept slipping off if you pressed on them from the wrong angle. I think I solved this problem by inserting cardboard wedges between the roof of the car and the upper end of each gutter hook. That seems to allow the hooks to keep a good grip. This rack could be a DEADLY (!!!) accessory to your car if just one of these hooks slips off and the rack and all your luggage goes flying into the path of a trailing car. It's a little scary that four pieces of cardboard are the only items precluding such a tragedy. Tomorrow we'll head for the beach and see what happens.
1,Review,"Piece of junk, don't waste your money. Doesn't strap down on the roof as well as it should. I had to purchase strong straps to hold to roof, and after my trip, I had dings in the roof from it. It now sits in my shed taking up space."
4,What I expected,"Great carrier for the price. It made a 1000 mile trip in winter weather from Minnesota to Pennsylvania. Have also used it for hauling cabinets and lumber.A random note: Spacing of the bottom bars is perfect for hauling standard decking boards.Leaks can be a problem during heavy rain. Doesn't fit the contour of the 2009 Elantra perfectly, but well enough."
2,Scratched,"I bought two used cobalt plates expecting them to be pretty much the same as new ones. Not so. Both are scratched over the entire surface of the plates. We're using them, but I should have paid for new ones. Not worth even the small price I paid."
5,Lake Webegon,"Love his writing style.This is an old book, but never had the chance to read it. I have another book of his that I hope to start soon. He is very down to earth and it is easy reading."
5,Mahler and Chailly togheter with Royal C is a safe choise,Chailly understands Mahler better than most conductors do and so does this orchestra.Sound is at top level and singing is VERY good. Filler (Totefeier) is a bonus and its a bargain to have two MODERN... NEW discs for the price of one.You cant go wrong with ANY of Chaillys (and Boulez) Mahler versions. Only challenger is Abbados version of Mahlers 8:th.Buy this one and a new (Mahler) world come to you.
5,GREAT '70s-era Kenton,"Lots of good stuff on here, including several odd-time-signture arrangements by Hank Levy (whose music is always good value).Worth MUCH more than I paid for it (via the Marketplace sellers)."
1,Not MY Name,"This author has several books published, under a pseudonym.I just want to say, as I'm publishing reviews under my own name, that this cr*p is not my work."
3,Decent product Lousy description,This product is displayed without a good description of actual size. We were looking for a tumbling mat and these looked like a good option. We bought 2 hoping to link them together. Instead of being 4x8 they are 2x6. I would return them but the kids opened them after they arrived.
2,lack of consistency,These books are taken from ww1 and ww2. There are many similarities with the way war was conducted and the time frame of technological improvements that caused change within the world wars. The problem is the lack of verisimilitude in the story. There is little consistency within his created science. I don't think this is horrible but it definitely detracts from the storyline. The author seems to have tried to convert a ocean going ship story to a science fiction story. good luck finding good literature.
2,There has to be better...,"I admire O'Reilly books for their uncanny ability to hook me into a lot of advance technologies. I desperately need to get a handle on sendmail for basic configuration, so naturally I come to O'Reilly.I investigated this book several times, and though it looks like a great awesome and essential reference, it simply does nothing for those trying to get off the ground. I think it is only for advanced and seasoned sendmail administrators, but for those trying to get a handle on sendmail, this is not the book.In contrast, I have books on postfix and exim mail systems by O'Reilly and these books are decent in getting you started. I am saddened that this is mainly a reference and not like other O'Reilly books. The book could have been called ""send mail, the definitive reference""."
5,You Need This!,"Excellent update from the 2nd edition. Anyone who administers a Sendmail server needs this ""reference"" includes SMTP Auth, libMilter etc.I would suggest to the negative reviewers here to stick with a zero configuration solution such as iMail, this isn't a hold your hand setup text, it's reference. Sendmail requires some dedication, the learning curve is steep, but the rewards are great."
2,Uninteresting and very slow...,"When I read the very positive reviews,I was planning to buy it straight away, well fortunately I rented it first.I thought this movie was really slow it seemed to drag on and on.For example, lots of times somebody is walking to a place, or just standing still for minutes long, and you could get the pointafter 30 seconds or something.The visuals of the movie were ok and sometimes very original, the effects I remember the best were the of the man walking in Van Gogh paintings.The stories are filled with various lessons and philosophies about live, but somehow a lot of this felt cliched.I think I understood the deeper meaning of most of the stories, but it failed very much to impress. It was as if I had heard or read these lessons about the destructivity of the human speciesfor example, lots of times. That's my main reason, I seemed to already know that, and now somebody is repeating it for me in some dreams."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz...,"After reading all the glowing reviews here I was really expecting something much, much better. I found this film mind-numbingly boring. Like another reviewer said, it's like watching a screen saver for a couple of hours. But this is just my opinion. Obviously, many people found this film enjoyable, but it's not for everyone. I'll give it two stars."
1,Contemplation,"After reading the video cover I wondered how one man can sum up our dreams, but Akira Kurosawa sums up our worried dreams (if not all dreams are worries).There is a visionary visual glimpse into what might happen with our nuclear situation, with demons feeding off each other and realistical portrail of horrific chemicals. Childish innocence is shown in the opening 'dream', man's strife and wars are visual treats along with Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh. But Kurosawa does not leave the train of thought unfinished. He shows us an idelic simple living that makes surprising sense but it is something moderns will have difficulty swallowing.As in early Kurosawa films the stories are there leaving us to wonder but his last works are visual contemplations of this hellish world. The lack of conversations may leave some fidgeting but look beyond smallness and understand."
5,Dreams making me motionless,"This film transported me to an altogether different place - mystical & yet so real. It's a vignettte on what I call eight awakenings, eight stories interwoven so beautifully. The first one 'Sunshine through rain' is eclectic in it's imagnation & the last one 'Village of watermills' would be my ideal destination, & while I watched it, I was quite motionless.This Kurosawa film is one of my most treasured ones."
2,Out There..,"Good as far creative film, but hard to watch if you are looking for a plot. I have had a few friends think I am crazy for buying these movies off amazon, but you don't know if they will make some sort of impact in you life until you watch them. Buy them all because the more you see the better perspective you have on the film industry and on life..."
3,I don't know what this does,This is the first supplement that I have taken that smells like feces. Every-time I open the bottle I am disgusted.I bought this to help never damage.I give is 3 starts because I really don't know what this is or what it is suppose to do.I just read somewhere online it is recommended to repair never damage.I will update this review if it ever does something.I give it 3 stars because it smells like feces and I don't know what it does or feel like it is doing anything.
2,This book has very poor materials,Do not buy this book it will waste your time and money because this book does not have one complete example.
3,What ever happened to formal writing?,I can not stand to see contractions in text book work. It seems very unprofessional and it makes the text more difficult to read and comprehend. Contractions are for spoken words not written. This book is full of contractions and it makes it hard read.I do like the layout of the book and the content but the grammer is poor.
3,not quite as described,"I am surprised that the other reviewers didn't emphasize the problem with the size of the cord in relation to the charm and the awkward, stiff and lopsided way it makes the charm hang. This is a very pretty charm on a piece of cord that is actually too thick for the charm to hang naturally from. I had to take it off the cord and out it on a silver chain. It is pretty, but it doesn't really work as delivered. I also notice that the description says ""sterling silver clasp"" and it does not have any such thing. The cord is simply knotted on one end and looped on the other, as seen in the pictures. This actually made it easier to remove the charm, so it was a good thing. I received it as a gift so I can't complain about value, but I want people to know there is a glitch, especially if giving as a gift and won't get to see it, yourself."
4,Portable Curmudgeon,I have read almost all of the Curmudgeon books. They are great books if you like sarcasm and sharp wits. The one negative review said it would dull the sharpest minds but that's the point when you're reading books like this. You don't have to think and it's very entertaining. I think that reviewer might want to stay away from the Humor section.
4,"Who, What, When, Where?","This is a thoughtful and engrossing novel. It deals with many issues: cold war paranoia, memory loss, identity, loyalty. The cold war premise may not resonate with younger readers reared on GRAND THEFT AUTO but for those of you who still retain higher brain functions, WHO, is an intelligent and thought-provoking novel well worth checking out. The questions it raises about identity and memory and its rather subdued atmosphere of existential melancholia place it in the ranks of the novels of Philip K Dick."
4,The Goonies???,"This would be the Cyndi Lauper CD to get if only it included ""The Goonies 'R' Good Enough,"" which is out of print and very hard to find!"
5,Hey Eddie!,Another Eddie Murphy Classic! I love every scene from start to finish I mean how he was able to high-jack a home... CLASSIC! I actually have every movie... If you are an Eddie Murphy fan as I you must buy this one.
5,Beverly Hill Cop 11 DVD,Fantastic movie. The best movies he made (Eddie Murphy). Was used but works great. Other stRS ALSO very good too.
4,A fresh approach to these works,"I was hesitant to buy this cd as I couldn't figure how a woman, even one as talented as Barbara Bonney, could do justice to ""Dichterliebe"", written for the male voice. ""What is she thinking"", I thought. Well, curiosity got the best of me and I bought a copy. A very pleasant surprise, it works!"
1,Science Fiction,"This book should be listed under science fiction books. The author only speculates without providing any basis or proof, and even worse even his speculations are rehashes from other authors. His arguments can be destroyed by anyone with a basic knowledge of history and language. It was extreamly disappointing and in the entire book there was not even one original thought. The only thing out of this book that is useful are the footnotes, where a reader can get some useful information on other books."
4,4 out of 5 just because it's better than the first album!,"Ok! So maybe she doesn't have the best vocals in the world but you gotta admit... she really works it on this album! Songs like Play, Love don't cost a thing, CariÃ±o and Walk on sunshine achieve their goal which is to entertain and make you wanna sing along! J-Lo never claimed to have a Mariah or Whitney set of pipes, hell, she hasn't even claimed to be in Madonna's league but here she is giving it her all! Unfortunately, most people don't see beyond the latina actress/ Versace dress/Puffy's girlfriend hype! To reviewers that have rated her poorly, try to be objective... listen to the CD once more, putting all of the tabloid bull aside, and you'll see that J-Lo's music is on a par with other pop confections running around! This CD may not be the greatest one or the most soulful one, but it sure makes you want to dance and is an improvement from her debut album!! 4 out of 5 stars and damn proud of giving the CD that rating!"
3,not that bad,"i d-loaded this album about a week before it came out, and kept 6 out of the 15 tracks.those six were ""love dont cost a thing"" ""thats not me"" ""walking on sunshine"" ""we gotta talk"" ""dance with me"" and ""play"".i was SHOCKED to see how many of the reviews she received for this album were so incredbily scathing, the album is NOT THAT BAD. if you like teeny pop and modern r&b production you will like this album. if you dont, you will not. simple as that."
3,Ok but not as good as On the 6.,Track #5 Ain't it funny sounds weird. The chorus sounds like the chipmunks are singing it. Track #15 is really good. Track#6 Carino reminds me of a Carlos Santana song. I'm a Jennifer Lopez fan and enjoy her work but I'm not too satisfied with this cd.
5,"Hey, we gotta talk","well, i gotta say this is one of her better albums. I'm real is da bomb and so is the I'm real (murder remix) she and ja rule sound SOOOOOO fine together. Love dont' cost a thing is hott too but Play is almost a rip off of Madonna's music but J LO has a much better voice. well, im not gonna tell you to buy her cd but i highly recommend it cuz its so phat!"
1,bonito,I think this a awsome album because it show where the hispanics heritages will go and will be. I think this is the beggining of a good feature for j-Lo
1,Get real,"I feel the same as just about everyone here. While Jlow is a competent actress, in my opinion, she couldn't carry a note in a bucket. In addition, I think it is incredibly low of her to sing ""I'm Real"" then to find out that Ashanti sang the hook and they put in Jlow's voice with it later to make her sound good, because again, (in my opinion) she couldn't carry a note in a bucket. That is NOT real. Sorry. I was proud of her too, as a fellow Hispanic woman, and thought that she was finally giving her all into her music, then I felt like I was duped. I guess she's still acting, even when she sings. Just one listener's opinion."
4,J Lo new nickname new album flavour,"J Lo is a decent and very well-packaged sophomore effort to her debut on the 6. Jennifer's popularity has greatly risen and her movie profile (Wedding Planner) and music profile is pretty creditable with her tons of hits. Like ""Love DOn't Cost A Thing"" from this delicious album and i'm not talking about the cover =)... her album was very well-executed and slick she got top producers and wonderfully catchy songs that will be playing on the airwaves for while.. love don't cost a thing is a certified huge hit already. Buy the album it's hip it's J Lo and it's not all hype. =)"
4,Iamthereal20@aol.com,"Jennifer:You are fabulous you are right up there with the rest of my Latino divas like Celia Cruz and Charo and Rita Moreno who I adore. However, enough is enough with the peek a boo routine. You are above that. I don't know why you keep disrespecting yourself your latino community and the African American community by appearing nude every where. You don't need to resort to such tactics you are talented use what God has given you upstairs and go easy on the nudity. Kids are watching you love.You are a terrific actress and I hope you win an Academy Award. You looked stunning when you had on that Badgley Mischka (spelling)dress that year. Keep up the good work.Thanks, Rob"
1,J. Lo disappoints,"After jenifer lopez's first album her second came with anticipation, I went out and got it the first day it came out, what a mistake. Yes, her image her changed it is a shame her talent had to too. She fails the audience in so many ways with this album. The songs are short, harsh, and to mainstream to be enjoyed anywhere else but on the radio. It is sad the first album made me believe she had talent seemed like a fluke"
1,It's ok...not really,I was one of the millions of people who bought this album. I liked listening to 'Love Don't Cost a Thing' but after that I got bored listening to her other songs because they all sound the same. Nothing original at all. I should have downloaded the songs instead of buying the album. What a waste of money!
1,dont quit your day job,"this cd is awful, under the master mind of her friend/man p-diddy, J.lo is exactly that.. low. this is basically on the 6 but, with a slighty more puerto-rock feel. i only liked one song and that was for the beats only. but if you liked on the 6... then go or it."
2,not good,"i bought this cd at a music store. i should have visited amazon.com first to read the ratings. i see a lot of people agree with me. i can't believe people actually gave this a 4 or 5. i really like j-lo and am a big fan of all kinds of music, but this cd was a waste of money..."
3,A Decent CD,"Well, I heard Ms. Lopez's first CD and thought there was too many ballads, but this one is catchy, more uptempo, and ecletic. However, the lyrics are very repetitive. You'll find yourself asking, ""Didn't she say that in another song?"" There are some good songs on the album, my favorites being I'm Real, Play, Walking on Sunshine, Come over, Talk to Me, That's not me, and Dame. I'm not a hardcore J.Lo fan, but her voice doesn't sound that bad. She knows her vocal range and never goes out of it. I would even go as far as to say that she is pleasant to listen to. If you like cheesy bubblegum music, then you will like this. It is not a bad investment."
3,Re: Okie Dokie!!,"This is an OK album. Jen's vocals improved, slightly stronger now compared to the rather feeble ones I hear in ""On the 6."" I am still waiting for the day when she does not need a heavy chorus to back her in the songs. With much practice, she has the potential to be a genuine singer.The songs mmm...I like the Latin infested feel of ""Ain't It Funny"". Brings out the best of her voice. The rest are just ordinary mainstream R&B songs. Nothing special. You have heard ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" and ""Play"". So, tell me the difference between these two songs and Destiny's Child's ""Survivor""? Nil.Production wise, alright - she has got the best producers and writers to enhance the album. Put it this way, too MANY cooks spoil the broth especially when you have mediocre ingredient. Get it?Unless you absolutely have no other CD to buy, give J.Lo a try. P/S - Nice pictures, though."
1,JLO sucks big time,"I bought her first cd and it was of the hook. This cd, oh my god thank god i did not WASTE my money on material that does not sound good. Don't get me wrong she sings and dances good on her single but the other songs suck. Her voice needs a little more toning, she sounds like she has a cold in some of the songs. The love don't cost a thing,the only bad thing about it is that she repeats everything over and over and over and over. But its got good beat. If you a true fan you will this cd. My recommendation is borrow it from a friend and give it back cause you don't want to waste your money on something so terrible. THATS MY OPINION"
3,Mediocre.,"The only reason that I bought this CD was because I thought there would be more tracks like ""Love Don't Cost A Thing."" But there weren't. Really, the only other songs worth listening to her album were the singles that she released. And what's even more whack about it is that the remixes were better than the original...sad."
1,She sucks!,"Well, for me it's not so much that she is ""bad singer"" (I am not a music expert neither) - but she just seems to lack what is for me one of the more important things in the showbuisness actually : the individuality.Everything about her is so fake, commercial and primitive - she try so muuuch to be someone else that she is to please and be ""so damn cool"" lol .. she just make me pitty to look at and listen to her ..sorry but not!(And ..no it's not a comment of a fat girl with 7 childs lol ...but one of an actress and model unfortunatly .. and apart of this one who really enjoy looking at beautifull women.. tell me about someone like Penelope Cruz or Carre Otis, but Miss ""L.Jo"" ?? Sorry but not lol;)"
1,"Fortunately, JLO maybe the end of her","This does not even deserve 1 star. Love Don't Cost A Thing is good and catchy, but there is nothing else on that album comparable. Im Real--sounds like its stolen from Janet Jackson's Nasty and Play is stolen straight from Madonna's Music--she even tells the dj to play the song that turns her on. The slow songs are the WORST and remind you that she CAN'T SING!! I would not buy this album unless you are huge fan."
1,"J. Lo A HIT?...Why When You Got Deborah Gibsons ""M.Y.O.B.""!","Jennifer Lopez is back with weak vocals and all. Her first single ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" peaked at No.3 on the Hot 100 Billboard Chart.....WHY!!!!!!When you have Deborah Gibson back with a fantastic album ""M.Y.O.B."", a single from the same name with strong vocals, hooks, and dancebeats that will get you on the dance floor moving your booty.This just eludes me when a woman like Jennifer Lopez has a recording contract and can sell records.I wish she would just stick to her acting career, Jennifer your vocals are just lost in over produced mish mash music.This album is just a bomb....Recommendation try Deborah Gibsons ""MYOB"", you will not be disappointed, with the first killer R & B track ""What You Want"" to the pop dance infection of ""Your Secret"" to her next killer single ""MYOB"", Deborah Gibson should be getting all the attention not Jennifer Lopez or to her latin/black audience J.Lo, what next just J.?Puuuuuuuuuuhlease!"
1,Could it be any worse??,"This was truly the most horrid CD I ever bought. It is absolutely tasteless, not entertaining and is simply a bore to listen to. Her voice is very annoying and one can only breath with relief when the back-singers come in. I literally threw this one away because I truly couldn't even convince myself to make room for it in my CD collection."
1,Some of the worst songs I've ever heard,"I really loved ""On the 6"", but this second album is a real let down. My tastes are more of the trendy dance/pop songs that her first album had, and now ""J.Lo"" seems more into the HipHop/R&B style that I don't fancy. If you are into that style, then do definitely give it a listen. But I don't understand how some people here have reviewed her songs saying that her ""lyrics are great"" with ""dancable tunes"". For example, the song ""Come Over (#7) is this slow, methodical tune that goes ""I love ... when you.. come ...over, please come over ... and when you come, it gives me fever"" & try to imagine this sung over 30 seconds of a slow beat, rediculous. Jennifer L doesn't have much of a voice (as many others here have mentioned) and when the songs are weak, her voice really shows through. When someone is as multi-talented as her, you have to realize that a lot of the credit has to be given to the producers, writers and mixers. What a dissapointment."
1,J.Lo - Real Low,"Seeing the new Jennifer Lopez album and all its hype, I was expecting a really good CD. Obviously, Jennifer Lopez is not a serious singer, but her songs are usually pretty decent. (Digital enhancement works wonders these days.) However, it seems that not even some major tweaking could help this crummy album. The songs - many written by J.Lo herself, along with 'Puffy' Combs - are unoriginal and boring. The two best songs are ""Play"" and ""Dame"", but otherwise, no songs really ring the bell. J.Lo sounds like she wishes she were the next Janet, but before she gains diva status, she sound learn how to put some feeling into her songs. Not to mention, some tone in her voice. Sorry J.Lo - your love may not cost a thing, but your CD may have cost you your ""singing"" career."
1,Cover your ears.,"One of the worst ""singers"" of all time....do not waste your money.....bad..bad..bad,how can anybody listen to this crap...0 stars and less."
1,One of the weakest voices i've ever heard,"You really don't realize how weak her voice is until you listen to her lesser known songs. Obviously she uses like 10 background singers to hide her voice somewhere in between but it becomes way too ridiculous when she TRIES to sing ballads! Yes you read it right, ballads. Apparently Miss Diva thinks her voice suits ballads as well. Well, let me tell u something Jelly: YOU ARE NOT, AND I REPEAT, YOU ARE NOT MARIAH CAREY! Get over it. Needless to say her latest ""ballad"" never got any airplay.That's it, save your money, don't spend it on a Jello CD. You'll thank me later.Oh and by the way, in case you didn't know, track no.2 ""Im Real"" was the one she stole from Mariah Carey. So stop stealing songs from other (talented) artists. Geez..."
2,average,I bet half of yous only gave it soo high because you like her. Im a fan ( not a big fan) of jennifer lopez. But there are some really dope and alot of really wack tunes and songs here.dont get it unless you are one of those never ending fans of hers
2,Track 1 is good....,"Love Don't Cost A Thing is the first song and the strongest song on the entire album. I find this album underproduced and way too poppy. Instead of going for her own sound, Jennifer decided to just go with the trend. I love ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" but it is no near as strong as any of the singles off On the 6. On The 6 seemed better produced and better put together. The album seemed much more professional, and had better songs. The music sounds like much more effort was put into On the 6, then onto J. Lo. J Lo sounds like it was put together in 1 or 2 months...I think Jen should have spent more time working on it, and should have recorded better quality songs. I suggest that you buy the single of Love Don't Cost A Thing, and don't buy this album. Stick with the first one, and if you already own it, you'll be disapointed by this. I was expecting more."
4,Jennifer Lopez finally got it right...BUT,"J.LO, actress-turned-singer Jennifer Lopez's second album, outdoes its predescesor ON THE 6 by a million times a million. This album is overall the best from Lopez's repitoire. Love this record! I don't agree with Mike who officially reviews the album: Lopez is NO Latina Madonna. Selena is and always will be! Lopez, although with this album makes her first steps toward becoming a sizzlin' performer, is no Selena."
5,No Regrets,"I bought this album 12 hrs. after it was released and I have no regrets. This album has a little bit of everything R&B, Hip Hop, Pop, Salsa,Balleds ect. This Album will satisfy everyone no matter what your taste is! Jennifer Lopez has been very smart to release ""Love Don't Cost A Thing"" and to still have a number of exellent singles like ""Play"" (which will be her next single) and ""Walking on Sunshine"" which WILL be a club hit and will have people danceing like crazy! ""Dame"" (a duet with Chayane) is going to be a spanish hit! What makes me even happyier with this album is that Jennifer Lopez wrote 7 of the 15 songs. J.Lo made its debut on the Billoard Magazine as the number one album. What are waiting for GET THIS ALBUM!"
1,Don't buy.,"These things suck. I had some wireless headphones, not 900MHz and quite a bit cheaper that worked much better than these. There is always static and the headphones don't take batteries you have to charge the one in it, and the battery life is horrible. Don't buy. Not worth the money."
4,VideoNow Color Player,I bought this for my 4 year old who needed entertainment in the car. Well it does just that. The car rides are quiet now that he watches his movies. The 2 downfalls I see to this product is 1) the fact that its not as durable as it should be for kids. My son just bumps it and it skips....should be stronger for $70. 2) The CD's it plays only plays on the player. Cannot use it in regular DVD players. So for the value of a quiet car ride is great but like I said needs to be more sturdy for the price and fact its for a child.
5,Favorite purchase of the year.,"Though I had heard Gabriela Montero on PBS, which is why I decided to purchase this album, I was surprised at just how good the double album was. Her playing is flawless, light, well articulated, and the bonus album, an improvisational treatment on mostly classical themes, is delightful, sounds very much the way Bill Evans would have approached this type of music. The music is great, and I find myself playing both cd's over and over again. Highly recommended."
2,Classic Sam Peckinpah!,"It's been 30 years since I've seen this film on cable. I decided to re-visit this obscure film and see if I missed anything in the initial viewing. As it turned out, I didn't miss anything. It's pretty much the same, routine Sam Peckinpah film, filled with lots of blood, guts, bullets and slow-motion action. It's also a long, tedious film that is not one of his best, but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies."
3,"Nothing fancy, just records messages","There is nothing special about this machine. It has worked well for us so far. The speaker is not great and the voice is sort of annoying, but it is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do. No complaints for the amount we paid."
1,Piece of garbage,"I purchased this unit and it has been nothinhg but trouble. Whenever it gets hot, the picture goes completely out. The auto scan does not work and it freezes at 85%. Save your money!!! Stay away from Westinghouse."
1,Twenty pages,Is as far as I could get. It wasn't even good falling asleep material. I soak up every half decent book on the mob. This ain't.I understand the author is a journalist. Probly on the business page. It's that kind of droll style.It's weird cause the title and author are almost household names. Undeserved.
5,All Ages!,This series was on TV several years ago. We remembered it and my husband (Grandpa) thought the grandchildren would like it when they visited. All enjoyed it - that's 8 of us from 5 to 68 years old. There are two levels of humor - the children were roaring with laughter and an adult level that went right over the children's head.Silly yes - but so entertaining!
1,never watch the hold season,when i watch the first season it work great but the third and fourth season did not work for the 3 and 4 dices so i buy 3 more DVDs and do you know what happen it still did not work so i have to buy the VHS to see some the show.so if you have trouble call Disney dvd. com at 1-800-723-4763 then they will help you to fix the dvd for you.thank you for reading[[ASIN:B000N4SA8M Dinosaurs - The Complete Third and Fourth Seasons]
3,review on Fossil watch,"It has link problems, it is already broken and have not had it but 3 months. Disappointed!"
2,MAria ....leave rojo NOW!!,"Maria jimena has a beautiful voice, no doubt of that, she has a nice body, her performances are great, but in this album none of this seems to work out.""dedicado"" her chilean debut, and it`s basically ballads and more danceably tunes..the production is awful, for not to say shameless.."
2,Entertaining...if you're 2,"We live on a farm, and this may be, as far as learning, the worst video I have ever seen. However our two year old daughter asks for it by name, ""FARM"", every day. If you're looking for something useful, stay away. If you just need a distraction to get dinner fixed, it's worth the cost."
3,Not tastey,"I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat. I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them. I mixed half Science Diet dry kitten food with this product, and the cats began to eat less. I was worried about how much they were eating (nearly 1/4 their original diet) so I filled one bowl with this indoor cat food and one bowl with their kitten food. They barely touched the indoor cat food, while eating most of their kitten food. I ended up having to mix some canned cat food in with it to get them to eat.Part of it might be that the food is triangular and much larger than the kitten food. They had a hard time eating it at first, since they were used to the small pieces of the kitten food.Don't be discouraged, though. My cat can't tell the difference between the kitten food and the regular adult food. They really enjoy Science Diet's fish flavored food, so give that a try."
4,Quality OK. Impossible to find locally.,"Very good value. Quality ok. Although not an exact replica of what I needed, it does work well as a replcement for the piece of furniture I bought it for."
5,Good,"This is very good for me to search the information of the government of the U.S,and to known many date about it."
3,"very nice color. But, it is similar to the britain flag",the colors are nice and they look really pretty. It is well made and we all like. We think it is ok and we are enjoying our flag
4,Personal Video player Personal pain,"it cost so much money and the screen is so small, the only complant I really have is that it is expensive and then you have to buy the real video after paying 74.99 for the viewing screen."
2,Run away from it !,"I never thought I would say that about a Onkyo product. But this is a very dissapointing equipment. Sure, it's great to have a 6-disc changer at home, specially with wife and kids all wanting to watch different things. The sound is good and the remote easy to use. Them comes the pictures. It has a major, and from what I could see in other reviews around the net, tint problem. The picture gets extremely green. No matter how much you adjust the DVD or the TV, you allways see the ""greeness"" in everything. The jpeg compatibility is awfull. A picture takes almost 30 seconds to load. And despite all those problems, I live outside the US and can't return the player for anothe one. It seems like Onkyo has just released a DV-CP702 model, exactly the same as this one, but fixind those bugs. So, if you get a chance to buy this model, don't, you'll regret it."
1,"Warning, This is Poor DVD-R copy.","NEVER RECOMMEND. Actially ZERO Star at all. This one is worst ever product since I started AMAZON shoping. This DVD-R copy is look like transfer from home video tape,as if Bootleg. I'm wondering is this one really legal products?????"
2,All English Affair,"Take a classic hit like 'A Horse With No Name' by America and redo it(cover) by an English dud named Larrikin Love....maybe you're in heaven. Or take the Carole King number 'It's To late' and make it better with Englishman James Morrison belting it out. Again the wonderful 'Year Of The Cat' by another act named Psapp? Who you might say, I sure did.Walk away and save your money and time."
3,interesting idea,"A young girl's innocent heartfelt offering to save the life of a beloved family pet has unforeseen dark consequences in the future. The main character, Brenna, is slow to warm up to people finding it much easier to relate to dogs. I enjoyed her connection with the stray Corgi she takes in. It would have been nice to see her relationship with Masera expanded."
5,Hannah Montana Fever!,"My daughter loves Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus. She even got me to like the show and the songs. This CD is great. It makes you get up and dance, and the songs are all wholesome, easy-on-your-ears songs. There are even 4 extra songs by other singers to mix it up a little, but those are good, too. The DVD bonus disc is also great, giving you a little backstage VIP treatment along with a music video. I highly recommend this item if your daughter likes Hannah Montana."
3,Good but could be better,"I wanted an ipod touch since the first moment I saw it. It is an excelent MP3 player, with the apple quality. The screen is amazing, the touch interface works perfectly. I think it has 2 things that could be better:1- The back of the ipod get scratched so easy, I recommed get an ipod case, otherwise it will have hundreds of scratches in 2 days.2- The volume, if you have your ipod playing and locked and you want to change the volume level, you must press the unlock button then slide the touch button to unlock it, go to ""music"" -> ""playing now"" and change the volume. This is very annoying!! sometimes I have the ipod in my pocket and have to do all that to change the volume, a little volume control out of the screen will make it a perfect MP3 player.But well, this item is amazing, I recommend it."
4,Unusable While Driving,"I have two issues with this product.1. You have to look directly at the screen to do anything with it (unlike my old 5G iPod which I can manipulate while keeping my eye on the road).2. If you listen to audio books or podcasts it is nice to be able to fast forward and rewind. The slider bar on the iPod touch is too small to use effectively. I try to move backward 60 seconds, and I end up moving 5 minutes (or the beginning of the track). It drives you insane.. I have just stopped using it and gone back to the old iPod.Nice video player, great web browser."
4,"Great, especially with new updates","The ipod touch is everything you have read in the other reviews. High quality screen, great for movie and TV Show playback and the music displays and ease of use are unmatchable by other media player. For me, i really like the ical syncing abilities. I can bring all my calendars with me and now thanks to apples new update i can even edit and add new appointments from the ipod touch itself. I also like the ability of the touch to go on the ""real"" internet whenever a Wi-Fi connection is available. I would recommend getting a case, a screen protector is not necessary but if your worried about the ipod getting scratched (even with the scratch resistant surface) then get one, i got one for $10 and it was easy to apply and now my ipod touch is completely protected. I definitly recommend this product, and with the continued updates that Apple will give it will only get better"
3,"Cool toy, BUT...","If you dont have an iPhone already and not willing to switch to AT&T to use it, I would say this is as good as it gets for a ""iPhone"" minus the phone function. I returned mine because it was too pricey for my use of its function. Dont get me wrong, because this is a cool toy to have and to show off to your friends. But I didnt want to carry iTouch and my cell phone in my pocket. If you dont have any type of iPod, this could be one for you. But remember, Steve Jobs will continually plan ways to make you spend more money on his products... it's always gonna be bigger capacity, smaller, or just a wow factor added to the equation."
4,"Excellent intefase, the best mp3 player ever","Easy to use, excellent interfase. Apple needs to increase room at minimum 60GB in the ipod touch models."
5,Awesome product,I bought the Ipod touch for my daughter. She was thrilled. So far it's been a wonderful product and it never leaves her sight.
2,wait for improved version,"Prior to buying the Touch i used the Nano for music and my PSP for games, photos, and movies. When the touch came out i was excited. What a disappointment!! Photos and video are not even close to the PSP. If you enlarge a picture on the touch it will show noise. On the PSP i can enlarge any photo and still get clear pictures. I suspect it is because the touch ""optimizes"" the photos. It also cannot read PDF files and you cannot set your appointments manually (what a waste). This is really no more than a bigger music IPOD. I suspect the only people who will like this are fanboys of apple or have never seen or used a PSP. Overall this is a real ripoff for $400.00. I will stick with my PSP until apple can compare in the video and photo dept."
1,Mr.,"I have to recharge the battery evey 4hrs after less than 40 min. talking time, and the WiFi is real slow. I CALL THIS A DESIGN WITH NO COMMON SENSE. Do not buy it yet! Wait until Apple fix the battery major problem first hand."
5,Great unit,The kids had this for probably years now - just got around to the review. I just wish I would see them use it more.Way too many electronic toys these days.
4,"It's the best, but Apple should let users install applications","I had to jail break it to install the applications I desire, since by default there is no other way to install application like the iPhone. I think Apple should let users install applications and choose what they want to install in their hardware."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I got this a few weeks ago after having used an iPod video for 2 years. I already like iTunes, so no issues there. I really like the larger screen, and the touch interface works pretty well. I do have a few small quibbles with it:--No Notes - the iPhone has notes, so I'm not sure why they did not include them here. I am reduced to taking notes in a contact field.--Not easy to use while driving - I used to be able to FF and REW through a playlist while driving. You have to look at this one, which makes it not really usable for me most of the time.All in all I am happy to have it though!"
3,Cool but frustrating,"I think it's very cool and has some nice features. I like the navigation, the promise of internet access, the screen and image is crisp and clean, I'm looking forward to using it on my trip to europe next week. It definately rates high on the ""cool meter"".Frustrating because I can't get it to connect to the internet on my wireless network or my network at work. Nor have I found a way to load my own DVD's on it to watch. I'm hoping that is a ""user error"" and not because I can ownly load movies I buy from iTunes."
1,too many bugs,"I purchased the ipod touch and after spending over 12hrs tinkering with it and over 2 hours on the phone with apple tech service, I still had compatability problems between the ipod and my VAIO PC. You would think apple would know how to walk you through these types of problems or at least have a software patch available. I was not looking for a 20hr project so I returned it and purchased a Zune."
5,Awesome piece of technology.,"The IPod Touch is awesome. Not much else to say. It works great for listening to tunes. The Safari web browser rules. It is sometimes hard to get a connection, but when it does it is pretty quick. You can check your email through the web, surf, and just about anything else through a wi-fi connection. The Touch is has a calendar function, You-Tube player and address book."
1,Fraud...,I received an obvious rip off ipod from this seller. I contacted apple with the serial number and they confirmed it was a serial number they had on file as a counterfiet product. I didn't think amazon would support such shady stores. I received a prompt refund however I will NEVER buy from this seller again.
1,Beware...NOT enhanced for widescreen TV,"This DVD's back-cover states that this DVD is enhanced for widescreen T.V.'s. IT IS NOT. This is a non-anamorphic, non 16x9 compatable DVD. Still a good movie though."
3,Excellent Classic Sci-Fi,"I remember watching the film over at my Grandmother's in the early eighties.My Dad would take us over there and we would watch movies in our family room.I thought at the time it was violent and I was a little intimidated by it becauseof my age. Now that I am an adult, I appreciate way more than I did as a kid.It is totally a 3 to 4 star movie, no doubt, and you will like it."
5,"Great story, the book is even better","Outland is among my all time favorite movies because it interjects today's problems into a not-too distant world. Greed, corruption, courage, redemption. The story is intimately told, focusing on the characters and not on the technology."
4,Out-Dated Tech But Still an Exciting Thiller,"This 1981 scifi thriller is obviously outdated with its early 80's technology and cheesy special effects. But the story and drama is still intense and suspenseful. Connery plays a marshal new to the mining colony where he's completely on his own against a powerful and corrupt corporation. Despite the story lags and slow start (with way too much reading about the details of the colony), this was still a fun and exciting film that fans of retro scifi will enjoy now on blu-ray."
2,Bad transfer,"The movie itself gets four stars. The DVD gets two. The transfer is the worst I have ever seen. It shimmers, the colors are washed out, and the picture is softer than VHS. There are also few extras, which are becoming so common on DVD's these days.Again, the movie is wonderful, but wait for a better transfer, with more extras."
2,Low resolution copy,This copy of Outland looked poor on screen. I was hoping the format would have been better than it was. It seemed to be a quick copy of a high grade VCR tape. Very strong old-school interlacing made much of the movie very difficult to watch on a progressive screen. If you have an older CRT then this would work fine. I gave two stars instead of one because the disk and case arrived in excellent condition and very timely.
4,awesome,For the first time we get to see a great transfer of this film.Anyone who owns the DVD version will love this one.
5,WONDERFUL!,"I HAD READ THIS BOOK MANY YEARS AGO AND I AM AMAZED THAT IT IS THE ONLY BOOK THAT I STILL REMEMBER BEING MY ALLTIME FAVORIT. IT MADE ME LAUGH, CRY AND THINK ABOUT LIFE THROUGH THE CHARACTERS EYE'S. ONE OF CHRISTOPHER PIKES GREAT WORKS... SO, WHENS THE MOVIE!"
1,One of Pike's worst,"This book is awful. The story description isn't even what the book is about - there's virtually no part of the plot that involves the death pact. It's a touching story as far as the kids being in a hospice, but overall the story didn't make much sense and was kind of silly."
3,Kinda cool wine,"We installed the cooler in a relatively small space but found that we needed much more space around it than is recommended to get to and maintain a cool temperature. Even then, the motor keeps going non-stop."
1,Do not buy this,"My first unit lasted about 5 months, and I had it replaced under warranty costing me about $40 or so in shipping costs and about a month's time. The replacement lasted about a year before it just suddently stopped working. The unit is quiet, so I didn't notice that it quit working until I saw the temp was at 81. I wonder how long it was out before I noticed? Customer service has yet to respond to my inquiry - it's been about a week now. Bad product is matched by bad customer service."
1,Go With Another Brand,"We received an 18 bottle Wine Enthusiast refrigerator as a gift from my father-in-law. It never stops running and stopped cooling after 6 mos. When we called Wine Enthusiast, they sent us a new one, no questions asked, free of charge. About a year after that, it stopped cooling again. It's just not a well made refrigerator. Also, the shelving is very awkward and tight and many bottles will not fit. If you can fit the bottle on the shelf, the tight fit tears the labels, so if you like to save labels, don't count on it. We had to take the bottom shelf out for a few bottles that were just too thick. Like another reviewer said, if you have valuable wine, do not buy this."
3,a newer version is available,There is a newer version available on Amazon. Just do a search. The reproductions are 1000x better. The only thing I dislike is that all the articles in Camera Work are not included.
5,Great item,This was a great item!! My dad loved and it looks great on his car!I chose the 5 star rating bc everything is same as the description said!
2,would not want her as a neighbor,"While the subject matter was good, the writing style was lacking. Plus, I don't think she applies the same level of high-mindedness to herself as she does to other people. She seems to like to cut down trees but then complains later about flooding from upgradient homeowners that have cut down their trees. Also, she drowns possums. She complains that she raises her food to live on and she can't spare any to varmints. I'm not sure what she thinks the possum was eating the food for. I suspect to live on. And some of her arguments don't hold water. Like the vegetarian argument mentioned earlier. THis book could have used better editing."
4,Fascinating Life,"Interesting story of a long time organic gardner. It is NOT A HOW TO ORGANIC GARDENING BOOK. It is more a memoir of a dedicated home farmer and her life story of keeping her garden and the two homes at which she kept them. She is dedicated to eating locally. She makes her opinions forcefully as well as supplying the evidence to support them. To someone who grows what she eats, it is great that she addresses what to do about ""killing pests"", 4 legged and otherwise. Takes away some of the guilt we experience when we try to let everything live."
2,Good Story... Unimpressive Author,"After seeing this book at Kitchen Arts and Letters, I was intrigued, and finally picked it up a few weeks later. I am half way through the book now, and although the story and descriptions are informative and somewhat entertaining, the author continually disappoints me. She takes every opportunity to ""toot"" her own horn, and this is extremely distracting to the story. It is a real turn off from continuing with the book. I wanted to read it because I've always thought the idea of being able to grow your own food was fascinating, but she constantly name drops and say's she discovered this and she discovered that (not to mention she describes her husband has ""handsome"" on the first page)... I mean who really gives a hoot. Just tell up about the plants. Her personality really begins to irritate you after a while. Although I am still enjoying the book, I wish the author had shown some modesty."
2,I didn't have a good time,"The guitar had some fatal flaws with it. The high E string buzzed when fretted anywhere, and the rest of the strings buzzed when fretted at 14 or higher. Then the buzzing got worse, so I took it to a dealer, who had it replaced with a much nicer D10SCE with Fishburn electronics, after a 6 week wait and an additional $50. A seam failed in the gig back also, but Washburn replaced it with a nice hard case. Apart from some frustrating hours, I came out on top with this transaction. I believe this guitar is discontinued. Let's hope so."
5,santa Kid,This is an excellent children's book. I'm saving it for my granddaughter for Christmas. I'm sure that she is going to enjoy it!
1,What a disappointment!!!,"I have other books by Charles Stanley that are very good -- but this Bible really stinks! Don't waste your money! It's not even Christianity 101. The commentary by Stanley is not even good enough to be called ""banal"" -- it's below banal. I guess he thought he could make a few extra bucks with this one -- what a waste of paper!"
2,Thin may or may not be in,"These shoes look great and are extremely comfortable...but be forewarned. The outer leather and sole of these shoes are ridiculously thin. I am unaware if this is trendy or not, but for those of you looking for an everyday shoe, this may not be the proper choice. I truly believed that I was going to tear the eyelets the first time that I laced them up and I am not kidding when I say that the sole of these shoes are comparable to moccasins. Like I said, they look great and the price is right but do not plan on wearing these more than every once in a while."
4,Looks great but small problems,"The shoes look great! I've had many compliments in the past week after wearing them. My boss even thought I was interviewing for another position because the shoes made me look good.The only problems I see in them is they're a little larger than a normal 10.5 size. The bottoms were very slick on carpet when putting them on the first time so I had to skuff them up a little, which only took a day of wear and walking on concrete. They're also a little loud when walking on tile, but these are all small complaints to me.They are very comfortable and for the price I'm satisfied."
5,UNFAIRLY UNDERATED SINGER!,"With all the so-so mega millionaire singers in the industry, it shouldn't,but does, amaze me that this singer, who can belt a song out, the likes of Aretha (but smoother), Etta James (but more polished), Nancy Wilson (but more powerful); is so unfairly overlooked. Bad management perhaps?I don't know but whatever the reasons this woman's career didn't escalate like Celine Dion's is beyond reasoning. Her recording of ""If I Could"" (initially sung beautifully by Fancy Nancy herself), alone, is reason enough to purchase this cd. ""So Many Tears"" and ""Baby Come to Me"" are close favoritesBaby Come to Me: The Best of Regina Belle."
2,Not as entertaining as it thinks it is,"I read this book on the fervent recommendation of my daughter, and wasn't impressed. I didn't find any humor in it, and the characterizations were paper-thin. Absolutely no desire to read the follow-up sequels."
5,Good Book!,"I thought this book was a good book! This book is a fun little teen book (main characters are 14 yrs.) and girls can relate to the characters. Lucy, the main character, is going through some tough times and sometimes she thinks her best friends, Izzie and Nesta, are better than her and she thinks that they're basically flawless. She thinks she is the only one with the problems. But some things work out for her. You'll just have to read the book! It was good. It was nice and short. It'll probably make you want to get the next book after that. :-)"
1,Philosophical non-sense from a scientist,"I looked forward to see what a scientist could say about mind and consciousness. I was disappointed to find nothing of substance. I found only philosophical points of view and nothing that I would characterize as scientific such as is contained in some other publications from outside mainstream science. At the beginning of the film Dr Goswami references an occasion when he was very envious of other scientists that gave interesting lectures and he obviously decided to do something about it. He has now apparently become guru for many persons that think he is very great and he searches to recruit others to his group of quantum activists. He has certainly succeeded in his endeavor, but on the expense of insight and advance of science.The film has many clips to support associations, which makes it less dull. The clipping has also made a great job of putting together sequences from several interviews and lectures."
3,Not Biblically sound,"It is a lovely musical piece, however it isn't biblically sound doctorine. I assumed it was when I purchsed. However, it is beautiful to the ear."
1,why would you sing about this???,"this is the dumbest this to sing about, this shows that artists are running out of things to sing about and we need real artists with real talent back. using your daddy to get into the industry is not going to help you in the long run."
3,Great Way to Pass Time During Storms,"Fact or Crap provided a lot of entertainment and enjoyment for myself and my family while we were waiting out Hurricane Irene. It gave us many laughs and helped the time go by more quickly. The game has many intriguing questions. While some of them were very easy to answer, others did require a little more brain power. The rules and instructions were fairly straightforward to understand. Even the youngest members of the family found this to be fun, as it enabled some playful competition. Overall, this is not a bad game for most people to play. Jim Fargiano, author of: The Spoken Words of Spirit: Lessons From The Other Side"
2,It's just a game of chance-very dissapointing,"We purchased this game for our 11yr old son and set out to play it the day he opened it. My first observation was that this game is not made of high quality material. If you don't pay attention to your grip on the cards, you will surely bend them. The tokens are just cardboard. While playing, my 7yr old decided to join us. To give you an idea of how left up to chance this game is, at the end, I had 2 tokens, my 11yr old and husband had about equal amounts (something like 40) and my 7yr old had 3 less than them! With 10 more minutes of play he could have won the game - solely basing his answers on chance. In fact, my youngest was placing his 'fact' or 'crap' card on the table before the question was even asked and he STILL did well. The questions are way too obscure and at best you might win with a talent for reading faces as the questions are being asked. If you like Vegas and you're feeling lucky, you will like this game - it's all about luck."
3,casey muffleck,"TroublE with this movie, couldn't understand most of what Caesy Affleck was saying.As if he had his hanky over his mouth all the time."
4,Good Thriller,"Although the storyline was a bit unbelievable, this was a good, solid crime thriller. This is the first time I've seen Casey Affleck and he certainly is a good lead actor. Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris were at their usual best. Whether Affleck's character did the right thing haunts us to the end. Ben Affleck did a great job as a director.Too much cursing forces me to rate this a 4 - yes I am a prude."
3,Average,"The first half of Gone Baby Gone was as good as movies get. The story of a young girl's kidnapping and the man that gets hired to find her was set up perfectly. The neighborhood where this story takes place and the people that live there all seem very ugly and real. Unfortunately, roughly the last half of this movie turns into a disappointment. This is one of those self-important movies that tries to make you think about right and wrong, and how you might react in a similar situation. The only problem is that the situation is lame. Basically, the question is whether kidnapping is right or wrong. Is this really debatable?I must mention that the acting in this movie was excellent. Casey Affleck was actually tolerable in this movie, and Ed Harris, as always, is worth watching the movie. I almost gave this movie 4 stars based on the performances, but the movie as a whole just disappointed me."
4,Gone Baby Gone,Needed more freeman.Affleck did a very good job. Ended too soon. He needed to take the girlback to Freeman and his wife.
3,"Good topic, average film but acting is above the norm.",Mostly watchable private detective story about a missing girl that is captivating for a good part of its running time and the acting is above par. However some scenes are pretty harsh and the ending maybe a little contrived. Not quite worth the hype but again better than most of what is put on the shelves these days.
1,"I never actually ""hate"" anything except poverty, illiteracy and despair","If you're nostalgic for all those elements of Boston - Massachusetts really - that are its very worst, this is the movie for you. One long profanity after another."
4,Engrossing,I thought the plot was well paced and the actors made a convincing impact. This movie held my attention from start to finish.
4,Gone Baby Gone,"Great movie. Watched for the second time and still felt the anxiety and tension pouring from the great cast, great direction."
2,White trash filmmaking,"Looking for a film with a moral high ground? Look elsewhere. This is western Wyandotte country white trash video ""literature,"" although very well directed and performed white trash ""literature.""Every time I paused the movie to answer the phone, I paused on a closeup of Casey Affleck. This film belongs to him. He deserves better."
1,"If you adhere to the ""F"" word as one getting you through life, then shame on you!","This ""production"" where even the caterers are thanked in the credits, is pure rubbish. The use of profanity to get an R rating is such a cheap trick. The only worthwhile actor in the bunch of these unknowns is Morgan Freeman - but why would he associate himself with such a loser film? Casey Affleck has the worst possible diction, a lightweight voice that doesn't carry, and putting on an accent when he murmurs instead of speaks makes one believe the viewer has a hearing problem. It is hogwash in its purest form. STUPID, DUMB, PROFANE TO THE POINT OF DESECRATING JESUS CHRIST - well, Mr Ben Affleck the writer, how could you pen such filthy abomination? Repenting won't cut it for you sir, and as you must have found out by now, no one will touch you with a hundred foot pole. Career: OVER. Same goes for you Jennifer, how can you and your kids applaud Daddy at the end of the day is beyond anything I can imagine."
2,One ridiculously major flaw ruined it!! (Spoiler Alert,"I thought this film was very well done, however, I could not get over the fact that, when the child apparently went into the water, the authorities, and the families...Everyone just went along with the assumption that the child died, went ahead with a funeral, etc.... regardless of there being no body... All anyone heard was a splash, and that was good enough for everyone!!!I mean, come On!!! How hard would it be to find a body in a quarry!This blew the entire thing for me. This goes beyond suspending disbelief. This is just stupid writing, and it shows laziness, as well as a lack of respect for the intelligence of the audience, but after seeing how many glowing reviews have been posted, I realize that they must have assumed correctly."
2,Casey Affleck is awful,Good movie but Casey Affleck was horrible.No expression & mumbles to the point of being incoherent.Ed Harris was excellent as always & Morgan excellent too.
4,Useful Guide to Learn Music Theory,"I know nothing about music theory and have read five to six books on this subject. Most of them are written for seating in the ABRSM's examinations or just enough for playing one musical instrument. However, this book is tailor-made for layman, which is very detailed written in academic and professional style. To me and those who know nothing about music at all, it is very good ""road signal"" to get into it."
1,Child abuse,"This book advocates a rigid, dogmatic, tyrannical way of bringing up children, enforced with hitting. It is a how to manual on child abuse."
5,Looking all over to find this Christmas CD.......Found-it !!,First heard these songs on WPAT 93.1 FM Paterson. Percey Faith has always been a tradition at my house. Great family memories. Instrumental Christmas music at its best.
4,"Lots of attitude, little theory...","This is a fun read, if only for the attitude. On theory, the text is more than a bit light: Cinephiles after more heavy current philosophical grist should seek to grind elsewhere. Johnson's reliance on Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Freud and Sartre, et al., also indicate his modernist tendencies, which is, of course, in academia these days, still passÃ©, if not taboo, though that doesn't make his argument irrelevant. It's sort of refreshing to lie back and let Johnson make his point, even if he reads, at times, like an old fashioned muckraker."
5,AMAZING,this strap is amazing and i love it. i love how it locks so that it wont come off. although putting on my acoustic was a bit tough seeing as on of the pins is at an angle but it still fit. a little heavy too but its not too heavy
4,Great but careful on the color!,"I recently got the green strap. Sadly to my dismay, the color of the strap is a VERY dark green.I was hoping for a bright green color as pictured.Other than that fact, the strap does the job for the right price! I love it!"
4,Needed to replace the strap buttons on my RBX170,"Recently started learning to play the bass guitar. Picked up a Yamaha RBX170 and purchased this locking guitar strap. Even being a newbie, it was obvious that the locking mechanism was not going to work with the stock strap buttons on the guitar. So, I sent away for the ""free"" replacement buttons offered by D'Addario. In actuality, I had to pay $2.50 for shipping and handling. Didn't take long to receive the replacement buttons. I put up a picture to show you the difference between the stock RBX170 buttons and the replacement ones.So, with the replacement buttons in place (using the original screws and not the fat ones that came with the new buttons), the strap performs well. I only use this guitar at home (for now), so it's not subject to any flinging about. What matters to me is that the strap works, it was relatively inexpensive, and the locking mechanism does its job."
2,"It was a good strap, but only for a few months",I initially thought I bought a good strap until the rubber on the ends of the strap started fading away. The plastic under the rubber scratched my guitar around the strap pegs. After a couple months of using it one of the plastic ends snapped off while I was playing a show. It's also pretty awkward because the plastic ends of the strap aren't moveable.
5,works great,Does what its supposed to. Easy to use. Can lock and unlock with one hand. great locking strap for not much money. I have two.
4,nice,"i play bass guitar, acoustic, and electric. it has held them all, in the beginning the leather was kinda stiff. it was the little holes that gave me a small problem, but it was easy to fix. a good four out of five stars"
2,"WAY TOO LONG...should be labled ""Tall"" size !","i dont write many reviews but i ordered 3 of these just to stock up on basic extra straps so im never without one on a gig.....WAY TOO LONG ! to get the guitar (strat) up to a practice (abdomen) level your almost out of room for the buckles to take any more slack. i dont know how more reviewers dont notice this but if you wear your guitar up high you'll be out of luck here....i have plenty of straps and these seem like theyre made in ""Tall"" size....just checked back and no, they appear normal in the ads. im normal height and size, like i said all my other straps are fine. i dont like the feel of the strap being fully doubled up with slack.i would NOT recommend these if you dont wear the guitar around your knees."
3,NOT Ellington's best material,"Duke Ellington's recording career spanned 50 years, yet his earliest BRUNSWICK sides, like ""The Mooche,"" ""East St Louis Toodle-oo"" or ""Mood Indigo,"" waxed between 1926 and '31, remain definitive. Of these three, only an inferior version of ""Mood Indigo"" is represented on this set of much later COLUMBIA tracks.Ellington's signature piece, ""Take The 'A' Train,"" was recorded in 1941. Even that essential tune has no representation here. Another drawback of this later-career compilation is the ""girl singer"" has clearly passed her prime.Better sound fidelity alone is no substitute for the freshness and vitality of the young Duke and his band's early 78s. This CBS SPECIAL PRODUCTS collection is only for completists. For everyone else, seek out Ellington's records from his first 20 years."
5,Track List,1) Where You are 2) She's Out There 3) I Can't Live Without Your Love 4) I Remember 5) Gone 6) Fool For Lesser Thnings 7) Permament 8) No Next Time 9) She Flies 10) Let It Burn 11) Modern Day Bonnie & Clyde
1,"This is a very low budget, low quality movie - Buyer Beware!","This movie is very low quality. The kind you watch when all the paint has dried and the grass has stopped growing. I was able to discern this within 2 seconds of the opening scene, but I gave it a full two minutes. Check out the ""sniper rifle"" that the main character is holding. Check their wide open position. No cover. No sniper would no this! It's SILLY STUPID! Apparently they cut costs by not hiring a military consultant and so they did things the way they assumed it would be done, and sadly that is far from reality. I gave it ONE STAR for TWO reasons: 1) because it was free; 2)because I could not give it less than ONE STAR. I turned it off and applied a second coat of paint to the living room walls. Now I'll watch that dry. Where's my popcorn????"
5,A Great Collection of Comics,"Though not the best of all the Calvin and Hobbes books, this book still brings together a collection of great comics. The jokes in this book are really good, so that makes the book really funny. There are no obnoxious coments or sick things in not just this book, but the whole series. This book is really good for reading especially on rainy days or on days when you have nothing to do. This book is definately worth the price it is offered at."
2,Calvin and Hobbes,"The book was supposed to be used, but in very good condition. On the cover, half the color was missing, at least one page had been written on, and the title page fell out upon opening. I just expected it to be in better condition."
1,very disappointed,"well, basically, i was expecting new stories from calvin & hobbes but this is simply a collection of all the colored stories of calvin and hobbes from the others books (authoritative, indispensable, essential) if you dont have the others books, it's fine otherwise you may be very disappointed as i was. anyway, calvin and hobbes stories are always funny ;) could be good as a gift for someone who doesnt know yet calvin and hobbes."
3,For daddy and new born,"My husband and I are in love with this series. Having recently had a bundle, I got this for daddy as a Christmas gift so he can share with the baby..its a great book to add to any collection..the reason for 3stars? The top corner was horribly folded and bunched up upon receiving the package..other than that :) enjoy if you purchase it!"
3,Nice dress but not what expected,I'm sure this dress would work great for most but it was not what we expected. It is bigger than described and the color burgundy was darker than we expected.
4,would recommend,Good bargain. good quality- very pleased with product. The dresses run fairly true to size
3,Gillan in hard rock mode,"Gillan had left the jazz fusion beginnings of his solo career behind by the time of this release. This is hard rock all the way.The horror movie theatrics of ""Demon Driver"" are a little over the top, but ""Bluesy Blue Sea"", ""You're So Right"" and ""What's The Matter"" rock out with the best of 'em. There's even a cool cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Living For The City."" Jannick Gers (later to join Iron Maiden) handles the guitars quite nicely. While the material on ""Magic"" lacks the subtleties of Purple's best work, any Deep Purple fan should get a kick out of it."
2,Unique cabin explosition (6 stars).,"I saw this movie years ago,and it's an ok 'B movie',the only thing that was unique was when the passenger cabin inside the airliner explodes and you can see the pilots cabin being ripped away first and the carnage just slowly traveling up the passengers cabin. The special effects was definitely mind boggling and unique in that specific scene. The rest of the movie plot is a bad 'Charlie's angel' (D- movie) nightmare......."
2,Not what I thought I was buying,"As other customers here have noted, I was under the impression that what I was purchasing was larger and more expansive. The word ""starter"" did not appear in the product description, which led me to believe it was a full-sized kit, not a package of miniature products. The product arrived in a damaged external package (torn side) and with some of the products spilled open so that there was a strong scent attached.I've seen the same kit sold in local stores for a couple dollars less, without adding the shipping and handling costs. It was not worth the money or time of purchasing it. The seller should more accurately represent what's being sold in the description, a larger image, and more detailed text. Also, proper packaging to prevent tearing and spilling would have been nice. It's the only item I ordered thus far for the holidays this year with which I've been unhappy."
1,It's very small.,"I was kind of surprised at what I got. The picture is deceiving and I was expecting the products to be bigger. I understand that it is a ""starter kit"", but I guess I didn't realize that meant travel size and not much. It was okay for 14.95, but I was just kind of disappointed with the overall product."
2,This review refers to the 1996 edition.,"I used the first edition of this text in college back in 1972, and still have my copy. Now as an instructor I am using the 6th edition and am looking for a change. This book lacks three things; internet, internet, internet, and until it is brought up-to-date, it is not worth the price. It galls me that a book like this can seem to live forever while gouging undergraduates with poor revisions, and ""new"" editions designed solely to sell more books. Right now there are better books at half the price. I'm moving on.{This review refers to the 1996 edition.}"
5,Fun reading and great photos,I'm neither a serious stamp collector nor a gung-ho bicyclist but the author caught and held my interest with appealing descriptions and history and impressive color photography. I found the entire book fascinating.
3,A hotter spot!,"A loner (Johnson) drives into a small Texas town and gets himself a job at a used car dealership. He gets an idea for robbing a small local bank after he tries to open a new bank account at the same time a fire occurs nearby. The bank was left open while all of the employees went to fight the fire. The manipulative boss' wife (Madsen) wishes to use him for her own purposes - ""I always get what I want, Harry"". He resists, however, as he finds himself falling in love with the accountant (Connelly) at work, who has her own problem to work out. Written by Ed Sutton {esutton@mindspring.com}"
5,Good easy read,The Caner brothers have a wonderful testimony. The brief history and theology in this book is a tool and a must read for those who are interested in learning more about the Islamic Religion.
5,unveiling islam:An insider's look at muslim life and beliefs,great book.nicely written.argument presented is both compelling and logical.
2,Very subjective and unraleted the truth,"I grow up as Muslim and there are lots of concepts and beleives in the book that I have never heard about it. The authors blame Islam for their conflicts with their father. The book was written with hate and very far from being subjective and scientific. When I need to know about Christianity or Judaism, I prefer to read their original books and talk to the priest or rabbi. I would reccomend to learn Islam from objective and scientific books not from science fictions."
1,Full of hate and lies,"As a former Christian and now Muslim, I have to say that this book is a real disappointment. It's really quite hateful, and the things these guys say about Islam are complete fabrications. I'd like to ask any non-muslim who's interested in learning what Muslims believe to please just meet some muslims and talk to us in real life. Have coffee with a muslim once a week and ask him or her about their beliefs, instead of reading inaccuracies like this! It could really do us all a lot of good. We all need to get to know and understand each other better, that's the only way peace can be created, and we can't do that by reading books but by forging actual relationships.May the Peace of the ever merciful God be with you.Thank you."
1,islam and culture,It seems to me that this books get culture and the religion mixed up. I personally would not recommend this book if some one wants to know about Islam. Its a book to learn about different cultures
1,Inaccurate portrayal of Islam,"The book is rather bias against Islam (although not as extreme as some). Whatever the two brothers claim, they do not seem to have a good understanding of Islam. They lack education regarding key aspects of Islam. Their argument that jihad is physical and does not have a spiritual dimension is wrong; the fact of the matter is that Jihad has both dimensions with the spiritual dimension being the greater as the Prophet Muhammad himself said in a Hadith. This is just one example from the many errors in the book.If you want to learn about Islam, find another book written by someone who has a good grounding in Islamic education and understands the Islamic tradition in an authentic manner. Murata & Chittick's book ""The Vision of Islam"", for example, is much better. This one is not an honest account I'm sorry to say."
2,Out on a Limb,"This book might look good on a coffee table, but that's about all. It gives little information on how to build treehouses and lacks the genearal knowledge of other treehouse authors. If you want the best book on treehouses, check-out the original, The Treehouse Book, by David Stiles. His book gives detailed designs on how to build many different treehouses and helps you decide which one is best for you. Mr Stiles has written on the subject for over thirty years and has published several other books on treehouses, including, Tree Houses You Can Actually Build. These books enlighten and inform, rather than just visually stimulate. Anyone interested in learning about or building a treehouse would do well to pass on this book and go straight to the source--Mr Stiles--the treehouse guru."
4,The World of Treehouses,"This book opens up a world that for most of us has been closed since childhood, a world of playhouses nestled in and among trees. With brilliant photography the authors have arrayed for us a variety of unique playhouse conformations in settings that are startling in their beauty and bewildering in their design. Especially notable are the play structures by the artist, Barbara Butler. This book is a bountiful source of ideas and inspiration for those contemplating something special for their children. Or, for that matter, for anyone who has a hankering to spend some time a little closer to nature in a less than conventional setting."
1,1 star for product- 5 stars for customer service,The charger that was sent to me did not work at all. I was very impressed though with the customer service department which sent me a new charger (that did work) very quickly.
4,Amazon needs to clarify these SACDS!!!,"I had this one in the shopping cart but thanks to a reviewer- the only way I would have found this out- I noticed this SACD isnt in surround sound. For those of you who are new to SACD's, there really is'nt a point to buying one if it's not in MULTI CHANNEL. Unfortunately, Amazon.com's web pagers aren't too swift on the uptake in this SACD category I noticed- They do not specify on lots of these whether or not they're in Stereo or Multi. For the life of me, I can't figure out why these companies would even issue an SACD not in surround sound. Save your $$"
2,Stardust too cool,"I'm not used to Nelson singing as a crooner - the stuff is too smooth for him, he is best as cowboy or real country singer, it's back to the greatest hits for me."
5,Going home,"They say you can never go home again...but Willie and particulary this album takes me home again every time.It is a masterwork of Texas heart and soul.I have bought many cassetts and CD's of ""Stardust"". Every Texan (whether country fan or not) should have this. It makes such a great gift!"
2,"Great design, horrible color description","We bought the blue ""Active"" carrier. Once we opened it, it was by far more purple than blue. It definitely isn't the same color of the photos. That's the only reason for it's markdown in stars. The design of the actual BabyBjorn Baby Carrier Active is excellent. Definitely a five star design. We returned the ""blue"" one and shopped a bit more. We finally designed to get the ""Synergy"" design, which combines the ergonomic design of the ""Active"" and the breathability of the ""Air"" fabric. Hope this helps you guys..."
4,Another Sequel,"I love Christopher Reeves as superman, the first one was by far the best one. This movie was good up to a point. Why do we have to have sex in everything we see nowadays? In the comic strips of superman he didn't ever go to bed with Lois Lane and I felt the insert of that was totally unnecessary. It would have been better without it. Giving up his powers for her was foolish, thats what she loved about him, he was mysterious and different than all other men, making him exciting and giving her a sense of being someone special. Without those qualities, he was just another man. ...."
2,Not Worth All the Fuss,"When I heard this was coming out, I was really excited. I did think that, beginning with Superman II, the franchise was more camp than action movie. So I was hoping to see what different direction Dick Donner had planned. Apparently, it was different camera angles. The beginning is the same, the end is the same, there's details in the middle which are different, but add nothing new or worthwhile to the story. I wish I had rented it instead."
3,More of a tease of what could have been and only for the die hard fans.,"The potential was certainly there for Superman II to be as exceptional as the first film and this re-cut proves that Donner's original approach was stronger then the released film. Unfortunately re-cutting a film with missing and sub par pieces doesn't make it a better film, but simply an exercise in the filmmaking process. It is an interesting view and if you like Superman II as it is, then skip this. This cut is too little, too late."
1,Donner's cut is a downer,"After waiting so long I was very disappointed with this film. Too many important areas of the storyline were left out. Short references were made about situations which appeared in the original release of #II. If you had never seen the original, you would be totally lost. The chopped-up verison from Mr. Donner is a shame since he has directed other well received films. I should have read the Amazon reviews before wasting my money."
4,Superman II,"I got this movie because it's my personal favorite of the Superman movies{and too,the price was real good}!Some say this movie was comical{yes,it has that}but overall,I like this movie better than the 1st movie.And this movie,by far,has the best theme song!I haven't seen the Donner version,but from what I've read,I'm glad I haven't.From what I've read,the blending of scenes{or the scenes in this movie}isn't as good as the Lester version.However,this is NOT the best version of this movie.The best version of SupermanII{as some have said}was the ABC-TV version that was on TV back in the 1980's.That version was mostly a Lester-version movie,with the best Donner scenes in it.THIS is the best version of SupermanII!"
3,"I long ""special feature"" film","I was disappointed basically because of all the hype. The ""film"" did not meet expectations, nor was it better than the theactrical release. Hoever, I did enjoy viewing it in the manner I enjoy watching alternate/deleted scenes/endings given as special features with other movies. In the end, however, that's all it was for me."
2,Good thing this wasn't the theater version!,"I am a huge Superman fan. And I love the theatrical version of Superman II best of all. But the Richard Donner cut was the biggest disappointment (until Spiderman 3). It was interesting at first, and fun to see a scene that only came out of the screen checks. But the ending was completely disappointing and just made the movie terrible overall. I would give it 1 star, but gave it 2 for historical purposes - it is good to see that sometimes the studios do make the right decisions on movies!"
5,Superman II Revisited,"""Superman II"" looks and sounds cooler now that it has been transfered to BD format. Also now people get the see some scenes that were left out in the original film release."
1,Hollywood rewrites again.,"Although 'fantasy', the Superman mythos is pretty defined -- especially his powers. This movie felt entirely justified in altering the powers to fit the storyline, without any apparent need to do so. Superman teleports, Superman has magic forgetful breath, Superman has a big cellophane shield, Superman can be invisible, Superman can make multiple clones of himself. Please. Very disappointing sequel, and it only gets worse in III and IV. Did they ever even read the comic, or were they blinded by the pretty primary colors?"
2,1st BD I ever purchased that didnt play!!,"I am a huge superman fan, and was pumped to purchase Superman 2 (THE DONNER CUT) on BD and got it used as it saved me a few dollars and its nearly impossible for a BD to not play. This just so happened to be the 1st, I will send it back and hope to get one that plays so I can give my feedback on the movie. Thanks"
2,Amazon cuts out,"Unlike Netflix, which has high quality most of the time, we seem to have an issue with amazon movies stopping in the middle and needing a complete restart every time. We were happilly watching superman two and it just froze, then when we finally got it back, the picture quality was diminished. This happened with other streaming amazon purchases but has never happened with Netflix."
5,Worth watching !!,"I was a huge fan of the original S2 and was excited to find this version. The quality surpasses in this version versus the Lester version. The theme was a bit darker and more mature while maintaining its entertainment. The return of the music of John Williams elevated the film. Definately worth the purchasing. One word ""quality""."
1,unfavorable,"A total of 64 pages. One half of it is in German, the other half in English. It does not provide any biographical information as to his birth and early years; i.e. why did he join the SS. There are a LOT, a LOT or pictures for the 64 pictures. I would recommend not purchasing what is essentially a pamphlet of very little information. John"
3,Does the job.,"I ordered this for a turtle float for a small 10 gallon aquarium. I have had cork before, so I know about the natural brown color leaching out into the water. I put it in a plastic container of water, and changed water on it every day, rinsing it well between changes. It does at least two weeks of soaking before most of the stain is gone. I received a good sized hunk of cork bark, with just the right amount of slope."
3,Not His Best,"Christmas songs were not Sinatra's strength, especially as he got older. His Christmas songs with Columbia had nice moments, and several of the Captial holiday recordings are quite good, but his voice seemed to lack the warmth necessary to evoke real seasonal spirit. This recordings suffer in many cases from a ""made for TV"" artificiality. And he succumbed to the temptation to involve his significantly less talented children. The result is a very mixed bag. Better to stick with the earlier material, and let Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole and others do the real holiday heavy lifting."
5,A MUST HAVE,"I HAVE READ HERE SEVERAL REVIEWS . SOME OF THEM COMPLETELY DETAILED ABOUT EVERY SONG OF THIS CD, AND A FEW TOO CRITICAL.I DO NOT HAVE MANY SINATRA RECORDINGS AT HOME ,BUT I JUST WILL NEVER STOP ADMIRING THE QUALITY AND PURITY OF HIS VOICE.FOR ME THIS IS ""A MUST HAVE"".RARITIES LIKE SINGING AT HOME WITH HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. AS THE TIME GOES BY,HE SINGS BETTER EVERY YEAR!"
4,Great Gift for 60's Fans,Purchased as a gift for a Baby Boomer. Great gift for people who are in love with John Lennon and the Beattles culture. No negative feedback regarding gift. Product arrived on-time and in new condition.
5,"A great CD that captures all of ""Satchmo's"" best songs.","Originally recorded in 1967, this CD has a great quality of sound for its time. It puts all of Louis Armstrong's best hits all on one CD. Its starts off with ""Mack the Knife"" and doesn't stop until it gets to a great song called ""Indiana"".A must buy for ""Satchmo"" fans."
5,LOVED IT!,"BEING A PETER WELLER FAN, NOTWITHSTANDING, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS FILM. HOWEVER, I DID NOT SEE IT AS A ""HORROR"" FILM. TO ME, IT WAS MORE COMEDY-SUSPENSE, ESPECIALLY WHEN MR. FASTIDIOUS TRASHED HIS HOUSE DURING THE WAR WITH THE RAT. GREAT STUFF!!"
2,Too obtuse,"While this book does cover all the current theories regarding social research, it's too obtuse in its language. If the author had chosen to use less arcane, complicated vocabulary, and speak more plainly, this would have been a better textbook."
5,This is the best movie of all time!,I can't recommed this film enough. Jason Scott Lee gives an outstanding performance as the late Martial Arts star Bruce Lee. Lauren Holly did a great job as Linda Lee Cadwell. There is also an appearance by Robert Wagner and Shannon Lee. Shannon Lee is the daughter of Bruce Lee. Great Movie! Great Martial Arts! Action! Comedy! Romance! This film has everything!
3,Good...but.,"Though Dragon is a good movie, it's not acurate at all concerning Master Lee's life. Much of it is out of context or very exagerated. I think they could have presented it better than they did but sit is still a good movie to own."
3,"Good action, not-so-good Bio-pic","While containing some great action scenes, and good characters, this isn't a really accurate movie about Bruce Lee's life. Having said that, this is a very entertaining movie.Good fight scenes are mixed with an uplifting movie that has strong morale messages. Good family viewing, since the movie brings up a few subjects, like perseverence, tolerance of others, etc.-- JJ Timmins"
5,Best story of Bruce Lee as told by Linda Lee,Great acting and story of Bruce's life and told in a very moving way. Jason Scott Lee gives a great performance and a sort of reverence for how Bruce Lee lived his life.
4,Great story,"This is a great story about an amazing person. Buy the Tao of Jeet Kun Do along with this, and marvel at Bruce Lee the legend."
5,Great Movie,It is a great movie. I enjoyed it. Will buy the DVD. It is an inspiring and accurate portrayal and edifying in terms of what a Chinese immigrant's perception of USA is and vice-versa and how Bruce Lee did much to change those stereotypes and perceptions.
4,a lovely little christmas film,"as a lover of all things christmas, this dvd caught my eye at the rental store where i work. i was surprised how much i enjoyed the story, especially the acting of young jenna boyd and tom bosley.this is a sweet film and looks especially good for 'made for tv.'i also enjoyed the commentary by director john schneider... it was mostly technical but i found hearing about his tricks to work under time constraints and a small budget interesting. he mentions his feeling that we need more family friendly movies... and i wholeheartedly agree. i'll take a little syrupy sweetness that uplifts over something that brings my spirit down any day.i'll be adding this to my christmas film collection."
5,Lisa,I love that they can be washed & resued unlike bags which are a one-time use. I also love that you can add more milk (un-like a bag). The size is perfect and they store great.
1,Not for Freestyle Users--Falsely Advertised,"When this package arrived, I was very disappointed to see ""not for use with Single Deluxe or Freestyle breast pumps"" written in very small print on the front of the package. I assumed that because the product was made by Medela and claimed to be ""compatible with ALL Medela breast pumps,"" it would be compatible with my Medela Freestyle Breast pump."
4,Great but costly,"Great bottles; I bought two boxes of these for storing the milk in the freezer. Very convenient to use. My only issue is, they are too expensive (hence 4 stars only). I know bags are probably cheaper alternative; however, I don't want to risk the milk leaking or the bag breaking. I am starting to buy these bottles from Target (in store); they charge $4 less per box. (They add up!! Especially if you are buying lots of them.)"
3,More for storage than freezing,"Each bottle only holds 2.7 oz which I didn't read clearly on. I use this to pump when I know I don't have much. Also, I use the bottles to hold baby formula when I'm out and about."
1,Need to Be Able to Label Them Repeatedly,"My little guy started taking 6 ounces at a time by 2 months of age, so I these bottles had a very limited range of use for me. Size aside, I also found that labeling them was a problem. I like to label my breastmilk with his name, the date of collection and how many ounces are included, especially now that he is in daycare. There aren't any directions included in the box, and I couldn't figure out how to label and re-label these bottles with every collection."
4,Good,I used this bag for store the breastmilk since my little one used Medela's special feeder. Overall it was valuable.
2,Dated and poorly printed,"While getting ready for a two-month stint in Japan, I found an entry for this book and it looked helpful. When I received it, I was disappointed in the quality of the printing. Not only does it look cheap, but it is also difficult to read.When I got to Japan, I also realized that it is more than a bit dated. I have been traveling for more than a month now and have stopped using it. Granted, the cities are still in the same place on the maps, but the city maps need to be updated and corrected. This book was put together in 1991. My bad choice here. In the States, I would never depend on maps over 12 years old.This is just my experience. Take it for what it's worth."
2,Whaaaaattttt!!! it's not working???!!!!!,"I just bought this printer last July '06 and have been using it sporadically since most of the time I am not home. I purchase this item so that I can print some stuff for my wedding. After probably the 50th use (and I meant not heavy usage such as printing 3 to 5 pages with few graphics only) it stopped working! Now I can't print anything on it, not even for the stuff I need for my wedding. We tried using a new cable thinking it was the cable that didn't work and still no result. I kept stopping myself from ""accidentally"" dropping it to see if it would work. I give it two start because at least it gave me 6 months of use until it died. But anyway just beware if you are going to buy this thing. Think it through and read reviews. It might help prevent you from wasting money."
2,"Most of the Comedy is only Smile worthy, this is kind of entertaining","I purchased it, because the director did Commonwealth and Dance with the devil and it was very cheap. To me this movie had no laughing moments; I had a couple of smiles though. It is better to take this as just entertainment not expecting any gut-busting sequences or funniness in general. The music video on the disc was more entertaining and lively than the whole movie itself. The girlfriend/arrest sequence is a plot hole in a way because it never explores if the fat guy really liked her. How funny is a fat balding guy getting slapped with a reaction of no emotion? This statement is the base of the fantasy comedy duo in this movie."
2,Disappointing,"I'd read good stuff about this film, and it just wasn't very good. There was way too much overacting, and the main character was a friggin' dork. Why am I supposed to root for some highway patrol cop with a Napoleon complex? The ending was the only slightly satisfying aspect of it, and even then the blood looked fake. It was kinda funny seeing Peter Cetera as a hippie, though. For that I give it an extra star."
3,Good purchase,Easy to install and no problems connecting to my home network. Speed is a little slow and rarely gets above 36kbps compared to the 56kbps advertised. Fine for email and internet surfing but not so good for online gaming.
1,Don't be fooled! The box LIES! Does not work with VISTA,"I am soooooo ticked off! This is my second adapter. The first one that I bought was the Wireless N adapter that Linksys (the box) said was backwards compatible. I could never get it to work. I finally called Linksys and the rep told me that it was not backwards compatible. ""The box is wrong"". Then I bought this one. Again another lie... The box says it is ""VISTA CERTIFIED"" Baloney! When I opened the box there was a paper that said I needed to download the Vista drivers from the website, but there were no Vista drivers on the website, only XP. I spent 3-4 hours messing with the stupid thing, until I finally contacted a rep via chat and they told me that the Vista drivers were not available. I am so furious, this is a complete disrespect of my time as a customer. I will never buy a linksys product again!"
4,Value for price,This product is a very effective tool and an asset to systems without a wireless card.
2,Vista-Compatible? Not really...,"I tried for about an hour to install this on my Vista desktop, with no success. I followed every step of the included instructions, but could not get it to work.Also, this device is not plug-and-play, a feature that I think every modern computer product should have. To be fair, however, other wireless network adapters do not have this feature, either."
1,The worst,"I bought the Linksys speedbooster about a month ago. I needed something that was going to be fast and reliable considering the job that I do. However, this is the worst wireless adapter I have had! It is very inconsistent and works when it wants to work. There have been so many times, that I had to reboot or restart it. I DO NOT like it at all! Furthermore, it is not fast like it advertised. Don't waste your money on this!!!!"
4,BoxWave Kindle Fire Screen Protector,"Worked as promised, Easy to install, fit was good and installation instructions were clear, recommended for anyone wanting a top notice screen protector."
5,device protection,when applied correctly which was really easy whenyou follow directions and take your time it is great coverage with reduced glare and easier to keep clean Love it!
3,Anti-Glare Screen Protector,"This works well as an anti-glare screen. However, it scratchs easily and it is tough to keep lint from causing air bubbles. The Kindle Fire requires an anti-glare screen if you are reading in the sunshine!"
2,Static dust trap with added fingerprint enhancer,"Ordered this from uk & to be honest it was delevered very quickly, but like other people have stated as soon as you removed the backing film it instantly attracted every dust partical in the local area, luckly I had some anti static spray left over from putting a new screen protector on my phone so managed to solve the problem, eventually.As for the matt finish all I can say is it makes a great fingerprint enhancer as even after reading a couple of chapters of a book when any light hits it, its a mess. You will get a lot of use out of the free cleaning cloth!"
3,It's just ok.,"I thought it would be clearer than it is. Cuts down on clearness of picture. Otherwise went on easy and protects screen, Will probably try something different eventually."
3,Great screen protector,Screen is well protected and was easy to apply. Screen protector is of high quality and protects very well. Helpful that you can remove it clean it and reapply it as needed. For the price and protection you can't go wrong.
4,Take the Stairs Take the Stairs For God's Sake Take the Stairs,"What a wonderful, little known gem. I heard this movie is a classic in Holland, which is where it was made. This movie involves an elevator company putting an experimental chip inside of an elevator in a new office building. But when a lightning strike messes up the chip, the elevator begins trying to kill the people who go up. The movie, was filmed in a real office building, which I found cool, and the death scenes are done very well,especially the part where the security guard is decapitated by the lift. Just be sure, that you don't buy this because you want to see a truly suspencful, horrific, and excellent movie, buy this for the fun of seeing a weird, kind of cool, relatively obscure sci-fi, horror film. 4/5"
2,I am not happy with this purchase,"I got the book on time, but then I found out that the attached CD won't work. I could read only the first three pages, no more. I do not know what to do with it. Shall I send it back?Talma Shiloni"
5,A Key Influence in the 20th Century,"This work has influenced just about everyone who was anybody during the previous century.The first published work by Korzybski, emanates with enthusiasm towards humanity, hobeit somber some of the observations contained in it. It is rather simple; yet makes the reader think anew about long forgotten questions he/she might have had at one time or other. And there are some good answers in it; some of them can be seen as timeless."
4,Not Just another Autism Story,"This book is the first I've seen and read that was written or partially written by the person WITH autism. The mother recounts her son's life and then Sean himself interjects with what he remembers of that time in his life. I didn't know that those with Autism remembered how they acted and why they did it. It's a real eye opener to the autism world. What many autistic kids do is not longer just ""weird"" and ""pointless"" behaviour. Sean explains why he did such repititious things. For anyone even remotely interested in autism and definitely for anyone who has an autistic in the family, this a must read. I was captivated and couldn't put the book down. What also makes this an interesting read is Sean was born in the 60's. Back then, there was very little known about Autism and what people thought they knew was later proved wrong. Raising an autistic kid in the 60's and 70's was a lot harder than it is today."
2,none,the book was ok but i felt the motgher kept stopping his behavoir if he wanted to knock blocks down so be it he couldnt help that. just a thought but ohter wise the book was ok.
3,GOOD ALBUM,"SECOND FULL LENGHT ALBUM FROM ONE OF THE MANY BANDS EMERGED OUT AT THE END OF THE METAL SCENE, AS FOR THE ALBUM GOES, I THINK ITS A GOOD ALBUM WITH ALL THE NECESSARY INGREDIANTS FOR THE TYPICAL METAL ALBUM.BUT NOTE DONT GO AND SPEND TOO MUCH MONEY ON IT YOU MIGHT REGRET IT."
4,ROCKY'S BACK (FIRST BUT NOT LAST COMEBACK),"1979. Written and directed by Sylvester Stallone. For once, a sequel which is almost as good as the original movie. Even the scenes in the church and the hospital are touching in their naivete. For you and your children."
4,A Worthy Sequel!,"How can one top the performance of the first Rocky film? Obviously, that would be impossible.Yet this film, weaker than the original, still continues to flesh out these memorable characters and deepen our understanding of them.The one quality of this sequel that surpasses the original is the brilliant humor! I still laugh when I hear the lines...Reporter: ""Rocky! Do you think you have brain damage?""Rocky: ""I don't see any.""Or Rocky's hilarious attempt to star in commercials.Or Rocky's unique driving style, causing his dog ""Butkis"" to bark and whine in fear.Ultimately, the sheer entertainment value of this sequel makes it a worthy successor to the original epic.Jeff Messenger, the author of the novel ""The Shroud of Torrrington."""
2,"Not ""up to par""","I found this book to be mildly interesting, but, many words I wished to find were not included. I would not recommend it to fans of entomology."
3,short read,"Anything by or about Willie is always interesting!It is a very short read but funny & enlightening .The jokes are Willie!!The short facts align with others I have read about him .He is man who like Frank Sinatra ,does it his way."
3,A mixed bag,"I am 33 years old and a true Willie Nelson fan (but not a country music fan per se) I love Willie's activism almost as much as I love his voice. He is a true original. This book was, above all, a chance to get inside Willie's head for a while--and I enjoyed that. And while I will disagree with the reviewer who called him ""a genius,"" I still think the book was worth reading. Most of the jokes were funny, the lyrics are moving, and once in a while, Willie really hits his stride (the section about Farm Aid was fantastic) The book is worth looking at if only for the photographs of Willie and his family and friends. I love Willie, and chances are if you're even thinking of buying this book you do too. It's not great literature, but it's entertaining most of the time. Go ahead and buy it, what the heck?"
5,Good Old Fashioned Movie Fun,"This recording of the 1953 MGM adventure Valley of The Kings is one of the more ""exotic"" fun scores that came out of that era. This adventure flic is similar in spirit to Raiders Of The Lost Ark, but since the recording is in glorious Stereo, I've no idea if it comes from the original track tapes or if Miklos Rozsa re-recorded it at a much later date. Anyway, it never bores the listener; it simply transports you to other lands and other times. If you collect vintage movie soundtracks from the pen of the Masters, get this one."
5,Great for grinding pepper,"I liked it a lot better than I thought I would. The plastic feels nice and smooth and it grinds well. It doesn't have a cheap plastic gonna-break-soon feel, after all, it's made in Germany not China. I like that it stands upright and has a cap unlike a lot of other grinders that would leave peppper on the table."
5,Love it. Toast your spices and grind them when you need them!,"I have two of these, one for toasted cumin, the other for fennel. I need about 4 more! The little cap seals the top tightly, and and ceramic grinder is very efficient. It fits in with your other standard-sized spice bottles too."
1,Not that great,"I bought this for salt. It did an ok job, but it kept getting gummed up and sticking. Not exactly what I was looking for. Later I went to real salt and switched the grinder to flax seeds. Many whole seeds make it through the mechanism, meaning it's not doing the job."
2,Halfway between two great styles doesn't make a great style,"Tutorial books with step-by-step instructions hand-holding the reader through a complete solution to an example problem, followed up by some gently-guided exercises, are wonderful.Reference books that present complete just-the-facts information in a well-organized manner are wonderful.Trying to do both, while adhering fanatically to a pathological style of paired pages (one text, one figure), leads to disaster.Either goal - tutorial or reference - could have been accomplished magnificently in a book this heavy. Neither was."
1,"Language, Language, Language","I purchased this book on tape for a auto trip my husband and I were making.When I read the review I thought the story line was something we would both enjoy.I'm sorry to say we did not get pass the 1st 15 minutes before we had verbally heard about ever word you never want to hear spoken.I though of giving it to someone, but did not want to be responsible for passing on trash. Why do authors think they have to put trashy words in. The story would have been great without the language."
4,Progressiv rock of high quality,"Even 'tho some people would call progressive rockers Kansas too pretentious and too pedantic, they sure have the skills and ability to create interesting music. On this 2 cd set you get some of their finest songs, like the epic ""Carry on wayward son"", and the very emotional and beautiful ""Dust in the wind"" - two very well known and immortal tunes. Other songs that stand out from the rest are ""What's on my mind"", ""Portrait"", ""People of the south wind"", ""Relentless"" and ""Loner"". All these mentioned songs are the kind that immediately catches your attention since they're catchy and melodic. When it comes to the rest of the material you might have to listen more active to really appreciate it since it's far more complex than the average songs you get to hear on the radio these days."
3,A classic tale of the underdog who comes out on top,"Rocky is a Philadelphia man who boxes in small dives,when he's not out breaking thumbs.Somehow boxing champ Apollo Creed puts his gold up for grabs against Rocky kind of as a joke,he doesn't think an amatuer boxer is going to be able to hold his own against the champ.Of course Rocky comes through and becomes the new heavyweight champion to much surprise to everyone.Along the way Rocky finds love in a shy pet store clerk Adrian.A classic movie about the underdog rising to the challange and coming out on top."
3,5.1 Soundtrack Disappointing,"This review refers to the DVD version. Although I love Rocky and consider it one of my all tiem favorites, I was disappointed with the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. There is almost no sound in the rear channels. Now I realize Rocky is not a special effects movie, but there were times those channels should have been used such as the fight sequence. Almost the entire soundtrack is through the center channel. To be honest I don't now how they get away with calling it Dolby 5.1. In terms of picture quality there are several glitches throughout the movie, but it is ok for the most part.Also not all of the movies in the DVD 5 pack are Widescreen anamorphic. It is nice to have Rocky in widescreen DVD, but don't expect the same overall quality as other DVDs. Maybe that's why this DVD is cheaper than most good DVDs.Movie Rating: 4.5 DVD Rating: 2.0 Overall Rating: 3.0"
4,when sly proved 2 da world he wasn't a dumby,"this is one of all time favorite films this movie inspired me to do so many things when growning up i mean things that i was afraid of if it wasn't for this film i don't no what the world would be like today sly should have won an oscar. Apollo, Mick, Pauly, Adrenie, should have also won 4 best supporting actors/actresses everyone was great in this film not one thing was wrong well maybe the decision about claiming apollo as the champion again because rocky really whimped his but toward da end of the movie i love the songs from this film thats when i getting all my encouraging juice going to do some inspiring things myself this movie is what made sly and all the other actors and female actor who were mentioned into bigger successful stars in the future believe me when i say that"
3,"Great extras, poor sound quality",The movie arrived in a reasonable time. There are lots of entertaining insights from the actors and filmakers retrospecting on the film and other numerous extras. The only real downside is the poor sound quality. I found that I had to turn up the volume on my tv way above what I normally had it set to to hear the dialogue.
4,What good movies are made of :),This isn't my favorite Rocky movie but I grew up on the series and I think they're fantastic movies! If you've never seen the Rocky series I would highly recommend it if you like sports/action movies. It also has some pretty good advice in it as well for guys and girls :)
2,"It may work, if you can stand the taste","I love tea. I drink all kinds of teas, both herbal and caffeinated, almost always unsweetened. I even drink some pretty ""off the wall"" teas, and I have to say that I've really liked all the other Triple Leaf teas I've tried. However, this particular tea tastes awful. I have tried drinking three cups of it now, two plain and one with honey, and I just can't do it. It tastes like celery seed. I made a coworker smell and taste it, and she independently agreed that it tastes like celery seed, so I don't think it's just me. If you can drink this tea, you may see some benefits from it, but in this case, I'd much rather take supplements, or perhaps try another woman's tea that may suit my taste buds more."
2,"no Japanese language track, product description is wrong","The product description lists Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 under languages, but there are only Japanese subtitles. Very disapointing, as I've been searching for U.S. DVDS and Bluray with Japanese language tracks to help with my Japanese language study (I've gotten tired of watching anime all the time, and importing movies is expensive). I really wish Amazon would be more careful with their product descriptions, as it seems like these kinds of details are hardly ever 100% acurate. At least I only spent $3 for a used copy..."
5,Oldie but Goodie!,"My sons watched this with delight on VHS years ago. I purchased 2 copies, one for my three year old grandson and one for my friend's four year old grandson. They now watch it many times a day with delight. Big Bird belongs in the hearts of everone. I still enjoy watching the CD along with my grandson. Some things never grow old."
2,just for the little ones...barely,"This is no Muppet Movie, just a very thin feature about the dangers of adoption. Not really, of course, but Big Bird gets adopted and then runs back home to Sesame Street. A very few modest laughs from Oscar the Grouch and Sandra Bernhard as a surly waitress are the most anyone other than the very, very young will enjoy. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
4,it's ok,Ok you got me for someone who likes seeing horror movie i have a soft spot for this film this is ideal for kids the songs are cool the story is class so for someone like me who likes sick films i guess gose to show am human that i like seeing but anyway a must see for pepole who want's to see again and great for sesame street fans
2,Beautiful... but useless,"This tea pot is very attractive and looks great in our kitchen, but drips everywhere when you pour water. It doesn't matter if you do it slow, or fast, we've tried many different pouring techniques, but we always end up with a ton of water on the counter. Really too bad for such an expensive and beautiful kettle."
4,"Gorgeous color, but the handle gets hot","Love it, but the handle does get too-hot-to-touch once the water is boiling. The color is very nice though, so it's worth it."
3,Good but not here best!,"I love V.C Andrews.I have read most of her books,starting with Flowers in the Attic.I was only in grade 3. Butterfly was good,but not as good as I imagined.I only need to read the last two.I will only because Im a loyal fan."
4,A very good book,"I am a huge fan of V. C. Andrews. I started reading her books at age 17. So far I have all her books.I think ""Butterfly"" was her shortest book so far. I am looking forwards to reading her next book ""Crystal."""
2,WAS LET DOWN BUT WON'T GIVE UP,"I was let down from quality of her other books, which is why I rated it below average. It was really a short vinet' into a short period of this girl's life and very little happened (according to the standards of her other books). I hear RUNAWAYS will be a full novel (unlike these little 200 pagers), so my guess is they need these 4 insignificant little background stories to make the big picture work. I was let down, but I don't think Andrews is going to lose readers unless the whole series flops. Most of the buyers are die-hards, so they'll see it to the end just to see if RUNAWAYS is as pointless as the rest of them. My advice, change your mindset: Don't think of BUTTERFLY and the other first 3 as short, pointless background storys, think of them as a really long prologue to RUNAWAYS. Andrews' people would be smart to get the others out ASAP before people lose interest. Only time will tell..."
1,Don't even bother,"I read each book in the series, hoping that they turn out better than the previous one. Boy was I mistaken. I think the writer should go back to the original ""format"" of V.C. Andrews series."
2,This cd just doesn't cut it,If you are really into Bluegrass you will probably like this cd as it does offer quality instramentals but Hornsby's voice just doesn't fit this musical genre imo. There are certainly better cds to own from Bruce (Big Swing Face isn't one of them) so hard core fans might like this cd...most others won't though.
1,Lame Music,"I'm a real lover of Ricky Skaggs music, but this is by far the poorest put together CD in my collection. I guess I was after somemore good bluegrass. If you think you want to buy it listen to all the songs first. Take my advise pass this one up."
1,DON'T READ IT....IT IS GARBAGE,This book is a waste of time...The author emphasizes ONLY the negative aspects of the Immigration System and Immigrants that have committed crimes. REALITY is that most immigrants CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY to the American economy and culture. It is too late to make changes...this country was founded on immigrants. I wonder how the author's parents arrived to the US???? Was there a loophole->(gap in the law: a small mistake or omission in a rule or law that allows it to be circumvented) that permitted the author's parents to obtain a visa???
1,More racist garbage,"If you are an extremely conservative (socially, religiously, and politically) white Christian who thinks the world is falling apart and that the End of Days is near, you'll no doubt love this book. Anyone else with a half decent I.Q will see this book for the xenophobic tripe that it is. It's funny how Ms. Malkin forgets that A half century ago, her grandparents were taunted with every slur in the book, and looked at as ""foreign"" and ""un-american"". Yet she's alligned with the hard-right Christians. Go figure. I do have one good thing to say, this book makes a good doorstop."
5,A Great Read for Anyone,"I usually have no interest in politics whatsoever. It just so happened I was in a bookstore with three hours to burn that I stumpled onto this book. What can I say? The information in this book is staggering. It's one of those books that makes you think about the country you live in and the future of this great country... especially after the tragedy at 9/11.I had doubts when I first picked up the book. I thought it was another one of those ultra-conservative not in my backyard backlash against immigration. Well, it was anything but. If anything, the book provided many unbiased information that the mainstream media wouldn't even go near. This is definitely a must read for everyone."
5,Invasion Review:,What if the United States let in an unlimited amount of immigrants into our country? All the people of the world would be here. Then would we all would have $ 2.00 an hour jobs. There would be at least 30 languages. What if our population rose to one billion within the next 5 years. America accepts all. As soon as they cross the boarder they call themselves Americans.Why don't we just make it simple and call the whole world America?Invasion is a must read!
1,"The logic is, well, absent","I'm absolutely astonished by the fact that, if it weren't for the lax immigration policies Ms. Malkin so heavy-handedly derides, her parents would not have been allowed to immigrate here, and she would most likely be working in a putrid Filipino house of ill-repute servicing US soldiers. She should be eternally grateful that pundits of her ilk in the late '60s (who uniformly described anyone from that part of the world as ""nips"" and ""slopes"") didn't adversely affect the same immigration policies that allowed her own parents to ""slip under the radar."" Honestly, there is no logic here -- only fear, xenophobia, whatever you'd like to call it."
5,Must have VIk Muniz,Muniz writes articulately simply and with deep insight. If you like his work you will love it more after reading what he has to say about it.
3,CAUTION! ALMOST NONE AIR WARFARE HERE !,"Hillary was a fighter pilot of 603 Squadron, RAF, during the Battle of Britain. The first part of the books deals with his way into the RAF, of the class conflicts in Britain, of the hopes of his generation. THen he is shot down in his SPitfire and is burned out of the war. From then on, forget the ""action"" sequences. THe book deals only with his recovery in hospitals, talking to old friends, etc. The book is written more in Hemingway and Fitzgerald's style! No action..."
4,Defintely the MOST comprehensive disaster control book...,"How many other books of this type have a chapter concerning how to deal with a UFO crash? Seriously, Chapter 13 is entitled ""Enemy Attack and UFO Potential."" I've always been a skeptic concerning these types of things, but when a completely serious book like this has a chapter about dealing with UFOs (and one of the authors claims to have seen one), you just have to wonder..."
5,Fire Fighters and UFOs,"Who would have thought that a training manual on Disaster Control used by fire fighters would contain a chapter about UFOs??This is a pretty good indicator of how important and serious the subject actually is in the minds of some people.And fire fighters, of course, would be the first people on the scene of any air disaster, including the possibility of finding a crashed vehicle of unknown origin before the military gets there...?Fascinating and educating...and certainly worth having as part of a collection."
3,Pretty durable toy,"This toy was fun when my daughter first opened it. She would play with it and still play it. But after a few weeks, the balls will be missing if your kids throws them around the house. The learning on this is limited, you can only hammer the ball into the holes so many times before it gets boring and repetitive. But for one thing, it is durable, the ball and the hammer can be thrown around and won't break and the best of all, no paint will come off, at least not yet for us. The draw back is the hammer could be used as a weapon and you should never leave your child unattended when they play with this toy."
4,Fun over and over,"I gave this to my 2 year old grandson for his birthday. He plays with it over and over. Although the concept is simple, he enjoys repeatedly putting the balls on top and hitting them so they roll out the bottom. He says ""1-2-3"" while playing, or names the colors as he hits them. He has a long attention span for this toy!"
5,THE hammer ball toy,"I was looking for a toy of this type for my 13 month-old for Christmas. This one seemed to be the best option based on reviews. I was still unsure that my baby would be able to actually play with it. Sure enough, she only had to be shown once how it worked and she has been a pro ever since. It is so cute to watch her strike the balls with the hammer and see her excitement as they roll out of the side. The edges are all smooth and the hammer and balls are weighted perfectly. The toy is beautifully made (as are all Plan Toys) and will be in our play room for a very long time."
4,I loved it!,"It's my first Seth's book. It has just come out in bookstore translated in italian. I read it in three days. Wonderful. Very romantic and truly european. Absolutely not boring even if is about classical music, a very complex topic. The description of Carpaccio's dog in Schiavoni frescoes in Venice is amazing. I am buying a lot of copies of the book for people I love."
4,"Lyrical, Melodious, and a Bit Fuzzy","The ""word-smithing"" is very fine -- beautiful at times -- quite poetic. Occasionally, the music and other references are somewhat vague to the standard reader, and the plot is a bit fuzzy-wuzzy for my taste. I keep seeing Ralph Fiennes playing Michael, with all those mournful close-ups for which his movies are famous. The love story between the humans is old hat; the love story between humans and music, instruments, dead composers, and settings where their notes are played is much more interesting. Nonetheless, I'd recommend it to friends, especially those who love music and/or nice crafting of words. The CD enhances one's reading a great deal."
3,"truly,moistly,drippily","Seth's new novel is far,far easier than his previous opus magnum A Suitable Boy. A very cosy tale of love and yearning, this felt to me to be Truly, Madly, Deeply transposed with the Booker Prize in mind. For such standard and soppy fare (for those of you/us who never grew out of Sweet Valley High) this is a frighteningly engaging book which must be some kind of tribute to Seth's brilliant wordcraft. Most of the finer nuances of musical theory were lost on me but, again to the author's credit, this never obstructed the narrative. His prose is terrifically measured and precise - like listening to The Smiths compared to the music-based offerings of other current Anglo-Indian authors. I'd certainly tip it to win the Booker if only for the cosiness of its plot."
4,Beautiful and Passionate,"I was so impressed with Vikram SethÂ¡s A Suitable Boy that I could not wait for this novel. An equal music surpassed by expectations. No two books could have been more different, such that it is almost unbelievable that they were written by the same author.In A Equal Music, we follow the stories and emotions of Michael, as he searches for his true love. We read, hear and feel his loving touches for Julia, for his music and for his violin.It has been a long time since I read such a beautiful book. It is written so beautifully and with so much passion that you feel carried away by the emotions it evokes."
4,Love & Music Relationships,"For anyone who find Love & music combine, & thrive together. I offer to read this book.The story is about people, whose music is a great part of their lives. How they share (& part) their emotions to it.Through the eyes of the character Michael - a selfish emotional tale. Written by a man who knows how to write."
4,A very different book from Vikram Seth,"This book makes easy and relaxing reading. But, it is so different from his other books in the following aspects: > All his other books have a strong autobiographical touch to it so much so that I have to make effort to remember 'Michael' the main character is not Seth. > This book can be easily read without keeping a dictionary by the side unlike 'Golden Gate' and even 'Suitable Boy' to an extent. The book is very well written and the story flows, but don't expect to read Seth's typical distinctive style in the writing. I like the book."
4,Every profession has its jargon,"Much has been written about this book being so steeped in Western classical music that people who aren't familiar with such music will find the book boring or trite. That's not the case. True, there are long passages where the musicians talk in musical jargon. Seth makes no attempt to explain it in any way to the reader; that's the way they talk, and that's what you would have heard if you dropped into the conversation. Skimming over such passages does not detract from the rest of the book, which is lyrical and well written."
5,For all those who play music - read it!,I used to play classical piano but had not done so for seven years. This book gave me back my love.
2,Dave Brubeck,"Take Five makes it worth it, the other songs are not good unless you especially like jazz. I'd like a long 10 minute version of Take 5...Roy"
5,WHEN JAZZ GOES POP,"Well, I've been a jazz music fan for a very short time so I can't yet say I'm this big connoisseur and all but...but I bought Dave's Greatest Hits cd yesterday and as I got home I put it into my cd player right away and listened to it three times in a row!!Couldn't help tapping and snapping to it. What a GREAT music, folks! I love all the tracks, especially that ""Rondo a la Turk"" one which I didn't know was one of Dave's milestones.If you are looking for a real jazz masterpiece, try this cd and then tell me if I'm right. @."
5,"Brubeck's Greatest Hits, Great Album","This album contains many of the Brubecks's songs that I used to listen many years ago, including ""Its a Raggy Waltz"" and ""Take Five"", two of his true classics. It's a Raggy Waltz is a masterpiece, a very beautiful jazz song. I think it is interesting that you listen the samples.Dave give us nice compositions with a sophisticated harmony.Do not forget Paul Desmond, a very talented saxophonist that was essential to Brubeck's success.Enjoy it"
4,Always wanted.,"I always wanted this but never had a chance.Now his demise might create the shortage I thought so. The Blue Note has a branch club in Tokyo, many Japanese fans will not forget but the rest of the world?"
4,Yet Another Welcome Introduction To A Jazz Master,"Unlike jazz contemporaries Dave Brubeck and bandmates Cannonball Adderly and Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis never had a Top 40 hit single. Moreover, his best-known tracks are heard best within the context of their original albums. ""Kind of Blue"" has kindled more interest in Miles' music, and jazz generally, than any best-of collection could attempt.Even so, this is an excellent sampler of Miles Davis first 15 years on Columbia Records. Two ""Kind of Blue"" tracks are heard live in grittier, wider versions than on that legendary CD. Miles' influential ballad style shows up on the haunting ""My Funny Valentine."" And ""Walkin'"" here is from a live Antibes, France concert Lp featuring a young Tony Williams on drums.Those unfamiliar with Miles' music should use this as a springboard to Miles' most accessible music. Those owning ""Kind of Blue,"" but no other Miles albums, should get this to sample other Miles moods and styles. A recommended purchase either way."
4,Goldie Hawn's Role of a Lifetime,"Goldie Hawn once confessed to Oprah that ""Private Benjamin"" was a ""once in a lifetime "" role and she makes the most of it The part of a Philadelphia socialite turned Army Career Gal is perfect for Hawn's ditzy, sweet personna. As Judy Benjamin becomes less naive, Hawn does a masterful job in keeping her vunerable and sweet. This is the kind of role that Reese Witherspoon would play today, although less successfully. Though the going gets a bit slow in the film's second half, Hawn and a stellar supporting cast including Mary Kay Place, Sam Wanamaker, Barbara Barrie, and Oscar-nominated Eileen Brennan keep the laughs coming."
4,Goldie Hawn; simply delightful,"Goldie Hawn in arguably one of her best films (certainly one of her greatest performances of the 80's).PRIVATE BENJAMIN is the story of a ""Jewish princess"" called Judy Benjamin (Goldie Hawn), whose new husband expires on the honeymoon. With very little on the horizon, she rashly decides to enter the army, but comes under the wrath of tyrannical Captain Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan in an Oscar-nominated performance, and later a short-lived television sitcom spin-off).A classic ""fish out of water"" story, produced by Hawn and largely-tailored to her comedy talents.An amazing supporting cast too, with Armand Assante, Sam Wanamaker, Mary Kay Place, Albert Brooks, P.J. Soles, Craig T. Nelson, Barbara Barrie, Harry Dean Stanton, Gretchen Wyler and Sally Kirkland."
2,"Clumsy writing, uneventful story","The illustrations are, indeed, fun and engaging but the content is subpar and not the kind of exposure I would want to give my child.I'd thought that the reviewer who had written, ""I would caution parents... eventually, [the main character] realizes that living amongst man opens his world up to a whole new 'dining' experience..."" was overly prudish yet, alas, I agree. Who would want to read a bedtime story that involves the eating of a person?Equally aggravating is the poor language. Many an author -from Rudyard Kipling to Oscar Wilde- has used whimsy and nonsensical sequences. But their language carries a luster that embeds indelibly within a child's mind. The turn of words is colloquial and basic: labeling Napoleon's soldiers as ""bozos"" is one of many examples that I can do without!"
5,Best USB SmartMedia card reader,"Great design for a USB SmartMedia card reader. Totally portable and even fits in your pocket. I take pictures with my olympus digital camera, take card out of camera, place card in this cool reader and then hook it up to usb port. The reader shows up as a removable drive and I simply drag the pictures from card to my computer's hard drive. Quick and easy. I like it...."
2,Great Sphinx puzzle,Too hard for our house- the colors are very similiar across the pieces and we quit halfway through.
2,Drunk loser,"Dickey Betts used to be a good showman, and a huge part of the ABB sound. This effort, sadly, is a real let-down. He just sounds bad almost all the way through. The band is not well-rehearsed, and they all embarrass themselves here. The keyboard player is good, and towards the end of the show Dickey Betts sobers up enough to put together some quality licks, but if you're going to be a professional band, you really owe it to your audience to give them the best show you can. Dickey, man-to-man; you can do better than this, and you'd better lay off the booze or it will kill you."
5,Food fish,My saltwater fishes love this food (Hikari Marine-S Pellets) When I get near the fish tank they gather around waiting for me to drop the pellets. They eat like Piranhas and I love to see them eat.. Great food..!!!
3,A so-so device,"I orignally got this so that I could have 802.11g, 108Mbps connectivity. On the plus side, the DWL-G132 does do this but I've had two of these and both have failed after a couple of months.The problem seems to be heat and is evidenced by increasingly frequent loss of connectivity. The first one that failed was plugged into a USB port near the heat vent for my laptop. When I removed it, it was very hot and never worked after that. I thought it was my fault and got another about 3 months ago. It, too, has failed and I was very careful to keep it in the cradle away from any heat sources. When it failed, it was very hot to the touch.I've contacted D-Link but as yet I haven't gotten too far with them. $35 might be good enough for a throw away but I would have expectd to get more than three months service out of it."
5,Wireless USB Review,Great performance and easy install. I have already recommended the product to 3 other friends who have also purchased and loved the performance as well.
2,CD install that came with it does not install completely.,I keep getting error 1628 after trying to install this product from the CD. The driver install software on the CD is v1.2 and so is the one on their website. The install almost completes then I get that stupid error which is some InstallShield error. Then I can't uninstall it!!InstallShield's website says if all else fails then keep uninstalling Windows Updates until the install works. Yeah right. I says screw that. I finally returned this piece of junk.The only reason I gave this two stars is the form factor is very nice. Too bad NetGear doesn't have as nice a looking USB adapter.My system is WinXP SP2 with all the latest security updates. Also has Norton NIS 2005 with all the latest updates. Everything else USB I have plugs in fine. Other new software installs fine. I don't want garbage slowing down my system. Anyone know how to uninstall or what files I need to delete to get rid of D-Link's software/drivers?!
4,Great best of both worlds comedy.,"I love Baby Boom! Diane Keaton at her best as the powerhouse female executive, about to break through the glass ceiling, brought down to earth by a baby. Thinking that she has no maternal instincts whatsoever, and vowing that she has no aspirations toward motherhood, she is forced to re-evaluate her priorities when she ""inherits"" six month old Elizabeth. J.C. encounters the usual pitfalls of suddenly becoming a parent - think Three Men and a Baby trying to put on that first diaper. Of course, she warms to Elizabeth and her new role, and even moves out of the city seeking the serenity of the country life. Rural Vermont proves to be more of a challenge for J.C. than she expected and she inadvertently starts a business that could lead her back to the top of her game. But does she really want that life again? Would it be worth going back to, and would she have to give up the new life she has come to love?This is a comedy for the whole family to enjoy.Mary AnnNatchez, MS"
4,Baby Boom,This is a very enjoyable movie about a woman on the fast tract up the corporate ladder who inherits a baby. She is fired because of the time she has to spend with the baby. Her life and priorities change. It is an entertaing movie to watch. I recomend it.
4,Worth viewing,A subtle presentation of life's choices and values. Timeless. Not over done. Diane Keaton was beautiful. I loved this movie.
2,Disappointed,"The picture is very deceiving. I received all my food in a box, with no straw. The picture makes it look like the box is a nice box, but it is actually corrugated cardboard. Everything came boxed and thrown together. I ended up wrapping everything individually, instead of purchasing a nice container for the items."
3,A fair book.,It was a run of the mill book. I have read better and worse. I have been in this business for awhile.
5,Great product and great price!!!,Best price I have found for this product...quickly shipped to my house! Would definitely recommend and will purchase again!
2,Dog treats,"My Shiba Inu ate the first one -- the second time I offered him this treat, he just carried it around and whimpered until I took pity on him and threw it away -- there's something about the smell/taste of this that he does not like!"
3,Ok...,These are expensive and I'm not too sure that they're 100% safe for dogs...I'll stick to buying bully sticks! When I realized these were made of rawhide (after I purchased them) I haven't been giving them to my dog.
5,Amazing story of an amazing man,"This was truly one of the most inspirational books that I have ever read. It is the true story of an unfortunate man who was discovered in an alley back in 1945. Unable to hear or to speak, he was written off as ""severely retarded"" and made a ward of the state. His story, as much as we can know, begins here.He spent many years in a supposed ""institution"" that was little more than a warehouse for the mentally ill, a place filled with misery and despair. In spite of all this, he had a profound effect on those who got to know him and proved just how strong the human spirit can really be. A kind and gentle man who survived a living hell for many years, and still found a way to smile, to laugh, and to feel love for those who showed him true kindness.I highly recommend this story, it is one I feel certain will touch many hearts."
3,"Girls growing up, in an interesting way","It is definitely not what I expected, but then again the last time I read one of her books was when I was ten."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This is the worst book I have read in years. The writing had no texture. It was written for a twelve year old. The plot was very simple, purile, not moving and not a page turner. I did not want to read it. I was disappointed after reading and loving every word Judy Blume wrote as an adolescent. I would give the book to my twelve year old if he wasn't a boy."
3,"A celebration of lies, manipulation and irresponsibility","I have no idea WHY. I don't know Why I have read this book more than once. It's one thing to have a manipulating friend when you're 12. When you're adults and she's still lying to you and marrying your ex-lover, it's time to throw in the towel.Vix is a person so grateful, she's become a doormat to Caitlin. Caitlin can do anything and it doesn't matter. Who cares if Caitlin is a selfish brat who cares only about herself? Certainly not Vix. I failed to understand their friendship, which borders on abusive and codependent."
5,Excellent summer reading,"I can relate to these summer sisters. Growing up on an island in New England myself, this book brought back alot of memories..... God love ya, Caitlin."
4,Extremely Engrossing!,"I picked up the book at my sister's when I was visiting her last weekend. She warned me not to start reading but did I listen?? Of course not, and every spare second I could muster in the following 48 hours, I spent reading this book. I literally could not put it down. The book is not a life-altering experience by any means, but it is a fabulously enjoyable jaunt back to your youth. For some reason I could not wait to find out the fate of the herione, Victoria, and her selfish ""friend"" Caitlin."
5,"If you grew up in the 70's, this is the book for you!","Do you remember what it was like to be a teenage girl in the 70's? The Charlie's Angels, pink lipgloss, Shaun Cassidy and the Brady Bunch were such a big part of our lives. This book embelishes the love and friendship between two girls that lasts through their preadolesence into adulthood. It takes you back in time and reminds you how your first kiss felt and how you couldn't wait to share all your new experiences with your best friend. Judy Blume invites you to experience the 70's and 80's all over again through the words and feelings of two strong female characters. I couldn't put it down!"
2,Where's the love?,"I bought this one simply because I'm a Blume fan from way back; I can recall staying up way past my bedtime with a flashlight under the covers to find out if Margaret ever got her period, etc. What I've always loved most about her characters, male or female, was the fact that no matter who you were, you could identify with them and root for them in some way.Which is what I found so disappointing about this book. It's well-written and the characters are terrifically developed as always. . .but they're just completely unlikable! Yes, I had friends like Caitlin when I was growing up, but I grew up and for the most part, they never did. As for Vix, she just doesn't ring true to me; that's not a working-class kid talking, period. And I've never known anyone as mature and well adjusted as she sounds, who would pine for a high school crush like that, especially when he never really grows up either. Better luck next time, Judy."
5,Summer Sisters,"As a childhood lover of Judy Blume books I was happy to discover her more adult novels. Summer Sisters, with a nostalgic tone, follows the actions of two best friend girls with inherently different prospects on life. Growing up together, they deal with the tough issues of relationships and the hurt and betrayal of a best friend. You find yourself laughing out loud at their inside jokes and situations that can be related to most adolescent girls. Blume weaves the story brilliantly and each character is fully developed. With each problematic situation, one can distinguish and predict each character's reaction. The reader develops a liking and has sympathetic sentiment towards both girls and in the end wants both to succeed. A real page turner, I could not find myself to put it down."
4,amazing!,"I couldn't put this book down--I read all 400 pages in six hours!The intricacies of the friendships in this book, as well as the other relationships, are really true to form. Everyone should be able to identify with one of the characters in this book--from the mother who takes everything out on the daughter b/c the daughter is able to escape and the mother is not to the shy, misunderstood brother.I highly recommend this book to anyone with a few hours to spare."
3,So-So. Doesn't really live up to its ratings..,I was really excited about reading this book as I heard nothing but good about it. Its not that its *bad* but its been done before. Blume gives good charaterizations but the writing is choppy. It was predictable and could have been shortend to about 1/2 the length if taken out the many meaniningless parts. Overall something to read at the beach- just dont get to excited
2,"A quick, mindless read that is not particularly entertaining","I am glad I borrowed this book and did not buy it. It is a mindless meander through a quagmire of repetative drivel. Take out the ultimate solution arrive at by Caitlin, and this book could easily have been a Harlequin Romance. Really- one minute they are living in semi-poverty amid filth during their summer visits, and the next they are wealthy people in sophisticated surroundings. The characters are poorly developed, the plot does not exist and the editors must have no long term memory."
1,Don't be fooled! This book is not for teenagers!,"I'm sorry, call me a prude, but the situations these girls get themselves into are inappropriate for teenagers. Can't we just let teens have a chance to grow up on their own without exposing them to the horrors of the adult world through their literature, too?"
2,Disappointed,"Judy Blume was one of my favorite authors growing up. I've read all her books, ""Are You There God"", ""Forever"", etc. so I high hopes for this one. I struggled through the first 100 hundred pages, finding the story incredibly boring, and almost gave up finishing it. I wish I did. The end was rushed, the characters were so-so and the constant point of views were extremely annoying! (Jodi Picoult can get away with something like that, not Blume) The only good thing was that I wasted an afternoon curled up with my dog."
4,a wondeful book for all best friends to read and share,i absolutely loved judy blooms summer sisters it was a wonderful story of how friends shape and effect each others lives. it was an open and honest look into how women relate and truely share with their closest firends. it shows how who we chose for friends impacts our live for ever.
1,Absolute banal tripe,"I cannot understand how anyone would rate this book with more than two stars. It's very immature and only for people who like to read trash romance. I expected more from Ms. Blume, as I was a big fan of her books as a child. This book is easily forgotten."
2,Total trash and not that great,I was hoping for something where the characters had even a shred of the depth and realism that they do in her books for teenagers. I was SOOO disappointed. This could have been a Cosmo mini-series.
2,Not that Great,"I had never read a Judy Blume book before, so I gave it a try since I hear obout all these people who absolutely adore her work. I was disappointed when I read it though. It was boring and I did not relate to the characters well but I am willing to try her next one, it may be better."
2,If your time is very valuable.....don't waste it with this,"I'm 22 years old---maybe not even an adult yet--, and the situations in this book are even annoying to ME! You know what is cool?--if you have to name a baby soon, pick a name out of this book---very hip."
4,Light reading,"This was a quick easy read... it would be great for a plane trip or a day at the beach. I think this book is suitable for teens; the sex is not overly graphic, and it certainly isn't any worse than anything in Deenie or Then Again...Maybe I Won't. I felt that I could relate to Vix on some levels, especially with school & career... I am 24, out of college for two years, trying to establish myself in my career. I could also relate to having a friend like Caitlin. I think we have had a friend like her. I couldn't feel sorry for her though, but I did cry at the end"
5,For any woman or girl,"This is one of my favorite books! I took a two year break from reading, but a friend of mine gave me this, and I adored it. Now, I am a book nerd again! I guess it just took the right story to get me into it ! I gave it to my mom and she loved it as well.It's truly a book for any female. The story is quite simple. It is a coming of age story of two girls. It made me remember my teens, and it was extremely sweet. Please read it!"
2,Judy Blume should stick to writing children's books,"I've enjoyed some of JB's books for children and teenagers, but really she should stick to that market. I found 'Summer Sisters' fairly entertaining at the beginning but quickly began to loose interest as the book progressed from the characters' childhood to young adulthood and the characters failed to develop with it. The male characters in particular are shallow and exist only to provide a love interest for Vix/Caitlin.One of the strengths of JB's writing for children is the simplicity of her style but sadly translated to an adult novel this simply doesn't work."
2,"Not boring, but too unrealistic and over the top","I bought this book hoping for a light escape from the difficult reading for my English class. I succeeded. This book is interesting and keeps you reading, but it really does not have much substance. The two girls' friendship is very unrealistic, and their lives just seem too perfect. I mean come on, Caitlin doesn't study at all in school and she gets into Wellesley anyways? Vix gets into Harvard writing an essay on how great a friend Caitlin is? Vix lets Caitlin use and abuse her and comes back for more every summer? It's annoying reading about how two such imperfect people can have such perfect lives without hardly working at it. But all in all I would recommend this book if you want something to pass the time with. Don't expect anything great, though - it's definitely not in here."
1,summer sisters,"I read this book and then skimmed through it again. It was so depressing and degrading to the sister called Vix. She was portrayed as a doormat and after loving a man for that many years, would not have been so forgiving to another person for wisking him away. Seemingly she was supposed to be lucky in finding a romance with Gus, but the author should have developed that more. It would have been a much better story if the author had Caitlin explain her self a little more. I keep trying to understand ...What was her problem?I would like to ask the auther to explain several parts in the book, as I will never understand them, and ask that she write a sequal, that would finally bring Bru and Vix together again.This book made me so disgusted and dissatisfied with the outcome that I would truly like to correspond with the author and find out some answers. Don't read it, if you expect to feel satisfied with a good story. It was a let down."
1,horrific,"I was so disappointed in this. As several other reviewers have mentioned, this is no adult novel. Perhaps if I had read this at 15 I may have enjoyed it... but I did not. I thoroughly enjoyed her books as a kid, but will stick with Josephine Humphrys and Jane Smiley and the like for tales of relationships with substance between characters that elicit some sympathy. Can't even rate it as a good summer read for this year, but would appreciate some recommendations!"
5,WONDERFUL ENTERTAINING BOOK,i really enjoyed this book. I recommend it for teen and adult women/girls. a coming of age book.
3,Surprisingly un-captivating for a Judy Blume book,"As a big Judy Blume fan, I was extremely disappointed with ""Summer Sisters"". Not a single one of the characters was likeable, nor even captivating in my opinion, which made me steer toward finding the book quite bland, choppy, and though a fast read, it was in a way, ""un-readable."" The strange childhood customs such as igniting the ""power"" were way too unrealistic and none of us girls i'm sure can actually relate to much of what the went through in life. Honestly, how can 15 or so summers of their life be compacted into this short novel and be interesting and captivating? Get my point? Stick to ""Are you there God.."" or ""Deenie""."
5,This book was amazing,"I am a 15 year old girl and I love all of Judy Blume's books, and to see her coming out with Summer Sisters got me very excited. I have never been able to put her books down once I've started reading them. I've read them all except for Wifey, and I can't wait until she writes another good one."
2,"I don't believe in throwing books away, but....","this one went into the trash. I was very disappointed. I read and loved all of Blume's books as a child and so when I was in need of a vacation book, and had no idea what I wanted, I picked up Summer Sisters. I was distracted by the poor quality of the writing, technically speaking, although it did improve as the book went on. More importantly, I found that the story line was weak, and Blume was stretching to entertain her audience rather than augment the story with her excessive, redundant sex scenes.Contrary to another reader's opinion, I was not impressed with Blume's description of the book's settings, or with her development of the characters.To sum it up, I don't recommend this book. Unless you are looking for a mindless and quick read, spend your literary dollars elsewhere."
2,This story was dissappointing,"Though I normally enjoy stories by Blume, I guess that I wasnot prepared for the content of Summer Sisters. It had a few funnymoments, and a few interesting characters, but overall, it was realtively boring. I don't know anyone who thinks of sex as much as the two girls in this story. The read was not worth it."
1,DON'T BUY IT - GO TO THE LIBRARY !,I'm 32 yrs. old. This book was written for a 19 year old. The story went too fast and was blah.
4,I really enjoyed this book,"I really liked this book. It was very well-written and I liked the way it centered on the weird friendship between Vix and Caitlin. The eleventh hour surprise in the story concerning Bruce was interesting. The ending was a bit disappointing for me, but overall, an excellent book."
4,"Excellent, but drags at the end","This has always been a favorite book of mine and I just recently reread it and decided to write a review. The beginning in particular is especially engrossing and easy to read, very interesting and keeps you wanting to read more. However, the end sort of drags along and I find myself just continuing to find out how the brief glimpse of the future that we read in the preface comes to happen. It happens so fast that it is sort of disappointing, and life doesnt end the way you want it to for more than one of the characters. I guess thats how real life is though. Overall its a good book, I wish the excellent beginning would've carried on to the end though. Also, as you read through the summers on the island, its easy to lose track of where you are. The only indication you get that a new summer has begun this chapter, is a year above the first paragraph of the chapter, and if you're anything like me, you werent really paying attention to the previous year anyway."
1,"A book for ""simpletons"".","This book is extremely overrated!! I don't understand its 4-star rating. The story was not original, the writing was shallow, and there was no explanation into Caitlin's psyche. It was not even a good book for mindless entertainment. I'm just happy that its price matched its quality. This book does not even qualify as good beach reading material considering its current competition."
1,Very disappointing,"I grew up with Judy's books- she needs to stay with writing pre-pub books-""Tales of Fourth Grade Nothing"". I read it to and from the beach-as soon as I got home I threw it in the trash-not even wanting any of my friends to even borrow it. I was left very empty and felt I wasted my time reading it."
3,OK,"I prefer books with a little more sophisticated romance level than Blume offers. Novels like The Triumph and the Glory are far more fulfilling a read. But I often read Blume's stuff anyway even though I vow I never will again, she DOES have the ability to keep you turning the page. If you're 14, or just want some light diversion."
3,"Nice aroma, good body, but a very dry finish!","I fell right away for this book as it took me through the difficult teenage years we all try not to remember. As I was lured through to the end, I expected, as most of us would, a creative finish where one exhales and at the close of the cover. But, instead, was greeted with what seems to be a rushed and not well thought out ending. The plot and characters are well illuminated, but their actions seem less than credible."
1,Summe Sisters Lacks Substance,"Summer Sisters was my first Judy Blume book, and after reading it, I am happy that I avoided reading any of her work during my adolescence.This book was extremely disappointing! There was no beauty in the langauage; the plot was utterly predictable; the characters were cliches and thoroughly unlikable. I also found the many sex scenes superfluous and crassly written. As a middle school teacher, I certainly hope that Ms. Blume's young adult literature is of higher quality than her first ""adult"" novel, Summer Sisters."
1,Trash,"Not bad for trash, but really it is pure trash. The good brunette, the bad blond. Unlikely scenarios and characters. Soft porn sex scenes. I kind of enjoyed it while I was reading it. But, like junk food, you feel kind of gross afterwards for indulging."
4,"Fast moving novel, geared towards younge adults",I am a big Judy Blume fan and once again she has not let me down. I found Summer Sisters to be a fast moving novel definately geared towards younge adults. The book told the life of two girl that may or may not be easy to relate to. Either way it is a fast book that will take no longer than a week to read. For those younge adults that did enjoy it I recomend FOREVER another teen classic. I really enjoyed this book but I would not exactly catagorize it as an adult novel.
4,Perfect Summer Reading for Dancing Queens,"I just saw Judy last night at a author reading in Portland, OR. She read from Summer Sisters and talked about the devleopment of the novel. The audience was filled with a variety of ages, but by far was dominated by young women in their 20's and 30's, like me, clutching the book and listening with rapt attention to the author who brought us up through adolescence. I can't give this book a 10 on literary merit, but I can give it an 8 as it was a completely enjoyable and relaxing reading experience. This book seems like a gift from Judy to my generation."
5,A page turner,"I can't begin to describe how this book touched me. There are some parts of this book that touched me so all I felt was nostalgia and like I was looking back at a part of my life I could do over and there were parts that I felt so anxious to experience. For any twenty-something, this is the Judy Blume book you need to read. It's the third adult novel of Judy's on this list (23-25 here are the ones) and it's so fantastic. I'm glad I read Smart Women first because it helped me adjust to the transitioning narrators of this book. There are male and female narrators and I think the biggest key is to notice which narrators are absent. This is a book not for those who consider themselves ""grown ups"" but probably those who are adults but are still kids at heart. I wanted to cry at this book, to sob from the unfairness of life but it was so moving that I was too happy with it. This book is a celebration of youthly joys and after reading it you'll understand why."
5,Original!,Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway outshine Russo and Brosnan. The sexual tension in the original is fantastic compared to Russo walking around half naked and dumb! Watch the original......it's worth it!
4,a splinter in the windmills of your mind ...,"director norman jewison was on a nice run in the mid-late 60s, with movies like ""cincinatti kid"", ""in the heat of the night"", and this splendid exercise in style. the opening half hour, depicting the actual heist, is highlighted by the split-screen split-narrative effect; if the latter portion (once the faye dunaway character arrives) is not AS interesting, it remains a gripping watch, highlighted by the chess game sequence leading up to ""the kiss"", and superbly scored by michel legrand, featuring one of the best pop songs of its time ""the windmills of your mind""."
3,Has It Been THAT Many Years?,"After enjoying the remake of this movie I ordered the DVD of the original. I loved it at the theater back in the sixties and hadn't seen it since then. For once in a blue moon, I discovered I liked the remake better! The plot is only vaguely the same for these two movies. I remember this film was a great departure for Steve McQueen and he still seems to have a thug-like quality to me. Ms. Dunaway is a walking parade of late-sixties fashion, with lots of makeup and eyelashes. Strange, I didn't ever realize she had a scar on her forehead. Regardless, the style of cinematography is extremely dated now. Sort of like what today's jerky-camera commercials will look like a few years from now. Oh, it's fun to watch. It's just not as good a story as the remake."
1,BOOOOORING SHOW DO NOT BOTHER !!!,"I as a faithful Steve Mc Queen fan, always wanted to see this movie, it was a DOG... and I do NOT recommend it at all !!"
1,Garbage,item is a thin sheet of vynil that is so small with plastic checkers that look like they where made in some Jr. High metal shop. this game is useless due to the fact the vynil board will not ever lay flat it is always wrinkled.
3,Over the top,"The 3 stars are mostly for the quality of the bookand the photography.At first glance, it is a most impressive cookbook.Beautiful pictures/photography. Then, when viewing again,the plating is just way too much. It is almost as if chivesare used as a garnish, I could picture someone with a tweezers,carefully placing each piece of chive in ""just the right place"".I expected recipes using unexpected ingredients put together;for my taste, the combinations are just not to my liking andI doubt I will ever make any of the recipes.It's such a beautiful book, in and of itself, I did consider givingit away to someone. However, I personally don't know anyone else whowould try any of the recipes.I purchased the book, shipping including, for about $10, so nota huge waste of money. Would I buy it again, even at such a bargainprice? No."
2,yes they are foaming at the mouth,"what did eminem start, sounds like this should have been d12, what is this this cd sounds like it was made back in 1991, i see why shaniqua moved out.pass this by unless you want to hear someone sounding slim shady's cousin."
1,i see why shanequia don't live here no more,"sounds like eminem's long lost brother, also sounds like this was recorded back ion 1990. little t gets props for best artist who is sillier than slim shady if you wanna hear corny lyrics then get this is 4 you, what is this world coming to."
4,You won't believe it.!!!!,"It has been several months since I read this book and I still can't stop thinking about it. It is absolutely scary to think what the Clinton Administration and the Reno Reign of the Justice Department were able to pull off without the public knowing what they were doing.A classic example of what gives politics a bad name. How do they keep doing these kinds of things and still get by???If you want an interesting peek into the inside of what went on behind the scenes and behind closed doors, read this one."
4,Peeling Back the Onion,"After 8 long years of corruption in the highest offices of our government, we are at last, provided an analysis of the systematic dismemberment of our laws courtesy of Bill Clinton and his lap dog Janet Reno. Her reappointment for the second term came with strings and she danced to the tune flawlessly. In this very readable book, David Limbaugh provides us with a detailed explanation of her flagrant disregard to uphold our country's laws. He describes how she became a one woman defense team for Bill Clinton bringing the awesome power of the Justice Department to bear on those who would hold him accountable, including her own Independent Council."
5,Delicious,"This is pretty damn expensive for what you get (I know of few other single-ingredient spices that go for $5/oz). However, if you like green chili powder on stuff, you'll love it. It tastes good on everything!"
2,couldn't hold me,"Matt Braun is a pretty fair western writer. Some of his books are blah, but he also has some really great stories to tell. I started to read Hickok & Cody, and while I'm sure it isn't badly written, Braun just couldn't hold my interest. I only went through chapter 2. I had to stop because there are too many phenomenal books out there to spend time reading something that doesn't just grab me."
5,A Great Album,The O'Jays Really Give the Goods here.Message in the Music.Ship Ahoy is a Classic.A Great Song that deals With Slavery&it's Impact.that Song Alone is a 5.THe O'Jays have always been a Very Important Group.This Air I Breathe is a Great Song as well.The Title Track still Grooves it can Rock Any Dance Floor.A Great Collection here.
2,Not so good for VictoriaI,"This might be a good book for Vancouver as a whole, but if your vacation is limited to Victoria, you'll want to get a different book. The Victoria section is quite short, and the only detailed street map focuses exclusively on the region around the Inner Harbor. Why is that bad, you ask? Because the author recommends that you get out of that area, and offers his best reviews of restaurants and other locations that aren't on the map. We also found those recommendations to be less than helpful -- restaurant reviews often told you very little about a place except that it exists -- not too helpful when you're trying to decide where to go. If you do get this book for a visit to Victoria, you're at least going to want to pick up another map. Better than that would be to get a book that focuses exclusively on that city."
1,ghosting a real problem,"Its a great film, however throughout the film, there is alot of ghosting of images. Anywhere light is against dark ,there is a double image. I have checked with a friend,on two different systems with two different dvds,and two different sets of glasses , this problem still exsisted It seem to be a flaw in the manufacturing and not our systems. All other 3D movies play fine except this one. He purchased the disc I have at Amazon and feel a refund is in order and it be checked. It is so distracting ,it ruins the movie. Its a classic and should have been given the care it deserves in its remastering in 3D . I would be surprised if others are just disregarding the flaw ,,or this batch of dvds is flawed."
5,M is movies at its best,Wow..Hithcock..nuff said. Watch this one just for the smooth lead performances if nothing else. The plot line is obviously a great one but these actors are why we watch movies..Grace Kelly aside..the script in this one absolutely highlights some of the top dialogue performances in the Hitchcock run. Have fun and enjoy this classic
1,"Eagerly awaited, total disappointment",This movie wasn't shot in a widescreen format. So who made the decision to crop the frame and artificially create widescreen dimensions? It's so unnecessary. Who cares about the blank areas on the left and right. At least you know you're seeing the entire picture. The re-framing is so obvious and distracting that I had to stop watching after a few minutes. I watched the original un-cropped DVD version instead. It's far superior. This Blu-Ray version was a waste of money!
4,"""Do you really believe in the perfect murder?""","This is a typical story of a man planning, what he believes is the perfect murder of his wife. It is incredible that in 1954, movie makers created such a thought provoking plot that would be copied by others many decades later.Admittedly, the old style of acting is sometimes funny and quirky, with the fake kisses and talking to a person while your back is turned to them, but you simply can't ignore the clever techniques of shadows, lights, and various motifs at this early stage of cinema.This is another master piece by Hitchcock that is worth watching and having."
4,Decent little murder story,"A decent little mystery story. Saw it again recently (Sept. 2011) and was struck by the difference between the true depth of this movie, which was filmed in 3D, and the layer effect of the mostly post-converted 3D movies hitting movie screens the last couple of years. Yeah, the 3D was pretty much a gimmick in ""Dial M for Murder"", but Hitchcock understood something most folks making 3D films don't; 3D can heighten motion away from the viewer as well as toward the viewer."
5,What Reviewers Are Saying About this Book,"Ecstatic Writing is an eclectic collection of free form poetry and short stories that celebrates life's trials and tribulations. The words contained in these pages examine a life of adventure. The author's inimitable voice and the voices from his past are evident throughout. I think the book will be of particular interest to poetry enthusiasts and readers interested in Plains literature, as well as family and friends of the author.With a photographer's eye the author captures some of his fondest memoirs of growing up in Wyoming that he can share with friends and family and relive time and time again. The author's use of metaphor symbolizes significant life lessons and his course to self-identity. The author also pays particular attention to place and his ranch memories which is intriguing to learn about as a reader-for me it was like discovering a new world."
3,Does the job,Good:1. Cheap2. Does the job wellBad:1. One of the hooks broke off really soon. Not as sturdy and durable.
1,Jumbo Blue,the product was described to be a roll up shade. but it is not. its a fold-up shade. the description should be correct so people won't buy the wrong product.
5,Very Helpful!,This is a replacement for the dictionary I gave to another. It is very helpful when reading the technical works by L. Ron Hubbard.
1,very poor quality,"I have used Wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness. But I sincerely regret having bought these sheets. I purchased one set, and, after the 2nd wash, there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little ""balls"" felt scratchy). My husband asked me why we were using the ""old"" sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn! I was so suprised that I called Wamsutta directly, and the very nice lady there assured me that I must have gotten a defective set, because that simply ""doesn't happen with their sheets"". So I exchanged them with an identical pair. And the end of the story is that I am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing. What a disappointment. Absolutely do not recommend, and am now very wary of all Wamsutta products."
3,Why Not Widescreen?,"I recently replaced our old VHS of ""Chitty"" with this DVD -- boy, was I disappointed! Don't get me wrong, it's a great family film with catchy music, excellent production numbers and a lot of heart. But, why oh why, did they fail to give us the widescreen version? With ""pan and scan"" wonderful parts of the action are simply missing, and you know you are missing those things the director thought were important. OK, I admit I am a widescreen snob -- but with a DVD retailing for over $..., why not give us the whole movie, not just part?"
3,Great quality but picture is deceiving.,"All in all this is a great product! However, I was slightly disappointed when I saw the cover of the case was not as shown in the product description. It looks like something out of the 80's...."
5,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"I am very happy with my DVD purchases from Amazon. The price was reasonable, they got delivered relatively quickly and the product quality is great."
4,Fun and fantastic!,"I love watching Dick Van Dyke in these types of films, he seems such a natural for his character! This story was a favorite since childhood and another needing updating to DVD from our home-recorded VHS copy. The story shows the heights to which imagination can soar, while entertwining with the more mundane tale of the characters' lives. I love the family connection, the fun music and silliness of the characters. It is escapism at its best in a time when much of the world is moving along at a faster pace caught up in our technology. Sally Anne Howe is a wonderful choice to co-star with Mr. VanDyke, and her voice is gorgeous. A must see again for anyone!"
4,Great movie,"This is a great family movie that hasn't dated much over the years... still captures the minds of the young and has them laughing out loud and wanting to replay the move many many times over... great movie.. no smash ,crash or violence.. just a great clean fun family movie... my grandchildren ( 2---9yrs) just love it.."
5,This really holds together well...,"I don't actually remember seeing this as a kid, although I do remember it being a theatrical release. Our kid loves to watch this over and over, and it's actually still fun, (as opposed to being incredibly grating)."
4,Chitty-chitty is a win-win,"Our son is a huge fan of movie musicals with Mary Poppins as one of his all-time favorites. This movie not only features Dick Van Dyke but the music is written by at least one of the musical team members responsible for Mary Poppins. The movie is imaginative, creative with many humm-able songs. It is surprisingly dark at one point where they are looking to hunt down all the children, but that hasn't seemed to bother our son too much, but some viewers might find it a little scary. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as always. If your child has an active imagination, loves music and dance, this is for you."
3,The Book is Better,"I hardly know what to say about this movie. As a Disney musical, I suppose it hits the mark. Fun, catchy theme song; dance moves reminiscent of ""Mary Poppins"". However, having first listened to the audiobook read by Andrew Sachs, we were disappointed. The movie only vaguely resembles the actual story-line of the book, and I'm not sure why they did that. The original story is vastly superior, and the audiobook version is superb. Pop it in while you drive around; both you and your elementary-age children will enjoy it.Watch the movie for fun, but don't ignore the book because you've seen the movie. It's apples and oranges."
3,CHITTY CHITTY BANK BANK,"OTHER THAN THE CLASSIC DISNEY CARTOONS, CCBB WAS ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE MOVIES FOR ME AS A CHID. A FLYING CAR, NIFFTY GADETS, LOVABLE GOOFY TUNES, AND OF COURSE THE ""CHILD CATCHER"". DRESSED ALL IN BLACK, WITH A VERY PALE SKIN FACE, HE SEARCHES THE KINGDOM TO CAPTURE ANY AND ALL CHILDREN, BY ANY MEANS. HE WAS TRULY TERRIFING. IT RIVALS THE WITCH OF THE WEST FROM ""THE WIZARD OF OZ"". I STILL ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE, EXCEPT FOR ONE MAJOR FLAW IN THE DVD EDITION. THE MOVIE WAS FILMED IN SUPER PANAVISION 70MM, WHAT CONSUMERS GOT IS A PAN N SCAN TV VERSION. THIS IS TRULY AN ABOMINATION OF WHAT THE DIRECTOR ENTEDED US TO SEE. ALL MOVIES SHOULD BE SHOWN IN THERE ORIGINAL FORMAT! . NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO REALLY DON'T MIND SEEING THIS PAN VERSION, IT IS A MUST GET FOR CHIDREN AND ADULTS OF ANY AGE."
1,"An absolute classic - but alas, not in widescreen!","Who ever heard of a DVD that's NOT in widescreen? Well, this one falls into that category! It's a absolute classic, beautifully-produced film, and rated ""G"". (How refreshing!) But the beautiful cinematography and directing - not to mention the exquisite sets and gorgeous European landscapes - are ruined by the ""pan and scan"" transfer to tv proportions from the original ""Super Panavision"" format: almost 50 percent of the image has been deleted! What a tradgedy; I hope the movie industry doesn't continue vandalising their products this way!"
5,The Best Film Ever!!!!!!!,"i was born in 1988, years after the film came out but it was on tv once and we taped it, i watched it nearly everyday, now at 15 whenever i am bored or sick i watch it. I know every word every song the whole thing. This is a movie staring Dick Van Dyk, and is about a inventor named caractacus pots. He fixes up a old motor carr and they name it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. A King finds out about it and wants to steal it. I say you just have to buy the movie and watch it for yourself its an remarkably unforgettable experiance. There is also so many songs, i love P.O.S.H posh. chitty chitty bang bang of course. Tot sweet. there is one bad point about this film and that is the love song, i fastforward that part as it is too slow and lovey dovey. I LOVE THIS FILM. well im off to watch it bye"
3,Your on your own,"Rule number 1: Update the firmware.. without the update, the device is brain-dead.Rule number 2: Forget support: an email describing my problems (brain-deadness) went unanswered for 2 weeks, by then I had fumbled to my own cure.One might think a device like this might arrive with the latest firmware, not stuff more than two years old.Device is functional as advertised not withstanding a bad taste left by D-link support."
2,Latest Versions Work Well,"After some trouble with earlier versions of this product, I've now deployed several of these in different locations. It has worked well with consumer grade Netgear, Linksys, and D-Link products as well as a SonicWALL access point. It has NOT worked with a Netgear FWG114P wireless router. So, contrary to the description, it does not work with 'virtually' all wireless routers, so you need to check the D-Link website or just try it if it is not in the list. When it works, it's great."
1,What a joke,"Don't bother with this (and for that matter D-Link). I've spent several hours trying to get the range extender configured. First tried connecting to a Belkin router but was told by d-Link support that the chances of doing that were 50/50. Try 0%. So being the loyal fool that I am, I went out and purchased a d-Link 624 router. I have to say that I'm very pleased so far with the 624 but when the 710 wasn't recognizing the network, I was told that the 710 will only work with the 624 with a different firmware version. Even though both of these units were purchased within the last week, I was told that the only option that I have is to return them and ""look for a version of the 624 with the latest firmware"". Sorry d-Link support. How about ""look for another manufacturer""?What a cluster...."
4,"Once you get past configuration, works great!","Thanks to all who posted tips and suggestions on making this device work. I have a linksys wireless router and it took some finagling to get everything to work right but I was still up and running in about 25 minutes. I got the static IP and ping to work after messing with some settings (change these for your LAN adapter, not your wireless, if you have the Ethernet cable plugged in), but once I chose my network, even though both my LAN and wireless said connected at excellent strength, my browser wouldn't load. Restoring the automatic IP address assignment fixed my problem and the wireless works great. This device converted a signal my wireless card wouldn't even register in some parts of my house to an excellent signal! No complaints here. Dinged one star for not giving more details in the manual about where to find the IP address settings and troubleshooting the connection once it is made."
4,Works great,The extender is easy to set up and works really well at extending the range of the wireless network. I needed the extender to reach a mac on the 2nd floor (while the router is in the basement) and it did as promised. I had some questions for technical support and the folks at D-Link were very helpful.
5,Nip/Tuck Season One is Great,"I love the first season of Nip/Tuck.It's a Must Have!If you enjoy the show, it's great to go back and refresh your memory with this one!"
5,Love!,"Favorite former series! LOVE me some Julian McMahon (aka Christian Troy)!! Crazy premise, but excellent show! Glad to have the whole series!"
5,One of the best!,"This television show is definitely one of the best on tv, especially in the drama genre. I bought the boxset after seeing a couple espisodes on tv. i was blown away by the plots, the sex, language, and surgery scenes. Its like no other show on tv nowadays. everyone that i showed this show to ended up loving it and we watched the entire set over a weekend. i recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good provocative show that's willing to push the envelope."
1,"BEWARE! It works, but it isn't Tripp Lite","Don't be fooled by the ""Tripp Lite"" name. The seller is sending you a much cheaper MonoPrice DVI-D Single Link Male to HDMI Female adapter, that sells for just $2.26 on their site. Unfortunately, it isn't worth my time to return it, but I certainly got ripped off. Thought I was paying a quality product by a premium manufacturer. Instead I got this. I could have bought a generic one on Amazon, and saved myself at least half."
1,Wasn't as Pictured and Doesn't work,"I bought this item with the intention of hooking up my Droid Bionic to my Monitor.I have the Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable from Rocket Fish and that works fine connects to my monitor in the HDMI connector.I needed a Female HDMI to Male DVI-D Adapter to hook to my monitor's DVI Input and bought 2 of these based on the reviews.The item is not as pictured, nor does it say Tripp Lite on it. Also neither of them work and fail to connect to 3 different monitors."
4,Bubblegum music,"I remember seeing Adam perform in the 90s, the young girls went crazy, as did my date! He was very energetic, just like his easy to listen to and fun music.This album brings back some great memories."
4,I was wondering if Caveman would make it to DVD,"I remember watching this movie when I was 10. It was funny then, I hope I still find it so. I recall the best scene was the discovery of music. Of course, I would because I now teach music. Then again, I thought that it was funny to see (er, hear) Denis Quaid (I think) pee icecubes. Hey, it has been 22 years... I will by this DVD and totally not regret it."
2,caveman,the dvd case seemed original or maybe a coloured copy but the dvd itself seemed to be a copy. There was no picture or other sign of originality itself on the actual dvd
1,Stinkarooey!,When I think of all of the great movies that so many people are wondering and asking why isn't this movie on DVD yet and then I see that an awful movie like Caveman which is horrible is on DVD all I can say is something's not right about that! I can't believe the great Ringo Starr would even want to be in this movie and Shelley Long why was she wasting her talent in this dreck? Now I have seen some movies that were so bad they were good and funny to watch but Caveman is so bad it's bad.
4,White spots and the temptation to read more,"At first this book fascinates: a global view from one year in history. All those spotlight reports from all over the world make the reader realise what is happening at nearly the same moment in time: the establishment of a new dynasty's rule in China, the overthrow of the Stuarts in England, the departure of a Viceroy from Mexico ... Those are fascinating reports from 300 years ago, all with stories about individual people who left records: a nun in New Spain, a poet in Japan, a Jewish widow in Hamburg, a captured Turkish slave in the Balkans ... All those fates, all those stories make the reader want to learn more. Alas, this won't happen in this book. It is just a temptation to read other books, but not good history as such. For that it lacks a coherent structure; there is no theme beside the year 1688. Also there are too many white spots on the globe presented here. So not realy good history, but nevertheless a great book to be recomended!"
4,Great book for world history classes,"John Willis sought to accomplish one goal: an overview of world history for a single year. He accomplishes this in a very readable book. It can be a good corrective or complement to a narrower, traditional Anglocentric/Eurocentric presentation of history. Unfortunately the subject also makes it easy to criticize the book for being incomplete, or disconnected. But I can't imagine this book being written before the internet. In the past, it would require a large staff of ployglot librarians to tackle such a project, and at the cost of simplicity and narrative unity. Hopefully, 1688 will set a precedent for global popular histories."
1,Don't waste your time/money,"This is a piece of crap - cheaply made and unreliable. I bought one and it didn't work properly and had to return it. It says it is supposed to work up to 100 feet - well the best I could get it to do with FRESH batteries was a quarter of an inch. Any further apart and it wouldn't work.And there's an error about the batteries - the receiver requires two ""AA"" batteries, but the receiver requires a 23A 12V battery, NOT ""AAA"" batteries.Don't waste your time on this piece of crap. A better use for your money would be the Emergency Phone Dialer from Radio Shack."
5,THIS WORKS AS IT SHOULD,I don't know why the previous reviewer was so negative but maybe she received a faulty one. ThIS WIRELESS PERSONAL PAGER works very well.The chirp is loud and definitely reaches across our large house. Also the 12V battery is already installed in the transmitter so all you would need are AA batteries. There is a belt clip on the receiver and the transmitter is on a neck cord.
5,A 70's soul must-have,"This was the first album I ever bought, at the age of ten, and the songs stay with me to this day. Although I grew up in Detroit and with the Motown Sound, I came of age listening to ""TSOP"" (The Sound Of Philly). ""992 Arguments"" was an underrated single from this album, but the 45 disc doesn't do it justice. You have to hear the album track with the vocals and lush orchestral arrangements. If you were going to start a 70's soul collection, this is a must have disc."
5,World's Most Comfortable Shoe!!,"I have always had 'hard-to-fit' feet - add to that I have rheumatoid arthritis so in my never-ending quest for comfort plus a little fun style, I stumbled upon these treats. These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. Lightweight and comfy - I can wear them all day without getting sore feet. The easy-on-and-off style is a definite plus and the simple Mary Jane style looks great with jeans and casual skirts. I now own three pair and I'm going to get more. You can't beat these little lovelies for cute style AND comfort!"
3,Crimson Moon,I have been reading this series and each book I have read is almost like the same book. It is an easy read and her books are repetitive.
5,Fantastic Book,This book is a real eye-opener and education. Everyone needs to read this book who values their freedom. The author really ties together a lot of loose threads and shows the connection between groups that you would think are doing good. Wrong. Please educate yourself before we lose our freedom in America. Climate change and global warming are totally a hoax. Highly recommended.
5,Simple and Works Great!,"I'm running Window XP. I just plug it in, XP recognizes it and I was downloading files in seconds. No software to install, no need to plug in my digital camera. Can't get easier than this."
5,SimpleTech CompactFlash Reader,"Now the word ""simple"" certainly describes this product. I received the SimpleTech CompactFlash Reader and was worried because I did not see any software for installing it. But it doesn't need any. Installation was a snap - all I did was plug it into the USB port and my computer loaded the new hardware in a flash. I have had no problems with it at all. I am using Windows XP. I also use a 12x (speed) 128mb Lexar media card. I have a Nikon Coolpix 4300. The SimpleTech Reader is really a nice bang for the buck. You can't beat it."
2,Won't work with all printers,I purchased this reading hoping to make it easier to copy my pictures. I have a HP Printer/copier/scanner (3 in 1) and this reader is not compatible to my printer.
5,It works great,"You plug in the CF card, plug the reader into a USB port, and you're in business. It's light and simple to use. I couldn't be happier with it."
1,very disappointed,"bought mainlt for ""The Chipmunk Song"" , which I loved ever since I was a kid. So excited when it came played it right away and the song skips!!"
5,christmas classic,"When I was a little girl, my aunt and uncle gave me this album for Christmas. I still treasure it. Last month, I decided to give it to my four year old nephew and two year old niece. I got a thank you note from them letting me know that they are looking forward to singing and dancing to it."
4,"great vocals, lyrics, and tight diverse songs","while these guys aren't the most innovative emo band to hit the scene, you still can't deny the catchiness of their songs and the broad vocal range, and conviction that singer chris lawrence (who, btw, does stay in key..) brings to them, particularly w/ the falsetto vocal lines in 'afraid to say this' which are also backed by honest eloquent lyrics. Plus for all you zolof fans (i'm not a fan in particular, but, i think i'm the minority)there's a duet between the lovely rachel minton and chris lawrence which is pretty amazing. If you're an avid emocore fan, this album won't disappoint."
5,Great Movie. Close to the book.,Just finished reading the book when I found this available. Fairly close to the book and Sutherland is a favorite of mine anyway.
1,"I ordered a DVD and got a VHS, I sent it back....someone wasn't paying attention!! Still haven't gotten the correct item yet!","This movie is great. unfortunately, I ordered a DVD and got a VHS. Someone wasn't paying attention!! I sent it back and still have not received a credit or the correct item."
5,Happy Petersen,"MARVELOUS, keeps you rivitrd to the story. One of my favorite Follrt works. ZThe book is sensational. I edon't have a DVD"
4,I like it,"The only complaint I have is a major one: The movie was produced in England with their scan rate and we are located in the US with a DIFFERENT scan rate! There was a bar covering the middle of the screen saying that the movie would not play. After fiddling with it for some time, my husband actually got the bar to disappear and the movie to play. I could not get it to do so. My husband hopes that he is somehow able to repeat that action (he has NO idea what he did!) if we ever wanted to watch the movie again!Other than that, everything was fine."
4,classic training worthy of any library,I'm a big fan of classic training methods and of using a partner as resistance and this book is full of similarly great techniques. Many of these exercises can be adapted to practicioners of other arts. This is well worth the read for both it's strengthening techniques and it's text.
4,Lutheran Handbook or Code of Conduct,"Martin Luther led the Reformation in Europe 1500s AD. He attacked people not knowing even the basic tenants of their faith. He made the gospel the main thing. That's how the middle ages ended was with Luther's 95 Theses. In Catholic you had to seek out a priest. Luther made it so you did it all yourself. There are 2 billion Christians worldwide. As much as 850 million people are non- belivers, etc. In Lutheran a priest could marry. It teaches you get saved through baptism. Lutheran is the third largest denomination in the world. The name ""Lutheran"" comes from its founder Martin Luther, not to be confused with Martin Luther King Jr."
1,Unhappy,My daughter is five with a larger than average head. This helmet says it will fit 5+ and it is too big on my daughter. Furthermore the actual plastic wrap for the helmet was cut open by someone prior to delivery it looks like someone bought it and changed their mind. I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a 6+ y/o.
2,no runner boards for bed,"Just received my bed frame and there were no runner boards to connect the head and foot boards. I called their office and their recording said they were closed for a week ????. I'll call next week and see what kind of service they have. As far as the quality of the head and foot board, they look very nice for the price. I hope I will be able to use them."
3,It's alright...,"I mean, what do you expect from teenage books like these? It's cute, kind of boring and girly for a while, but still cute. Read it when you have a few hours on hand. It's not the greatest book ever, but still an okay read."
5,Great series!,"Though I'm older than the target audience, I really enjoy this series. I think the books are adorable and the author does a bang up job of capturing what teenage life is life. Bravo!zing zang beeble bibble bop!zing zang beeble bibble bop!zing zang beeble bibble bop!zing zang beeble bibble bop!"
5,Wonderful Cards,I recently became acquainted with these types of cards and I must say I love them. They are beautiful and I always draw a card that I need
5,Kachow that was a good movie.,"Not sure if that was Christian Bale's first film or not, but he was tremendous! The entire film was just fabulous. The story, plotline, development. It is one of those movies that makes you wonder if it was based on a true story."
1,Unbearable Shallowness of Spielberg,"This movie is full of stereotypes against a serious topic. Spielberg appears to be in awe of the mighty empire of the sun, and despises the Chinese in every way. In parallel, there comes high class British rich people, and the usual greedy Americans. Apparently Mr Spielberg didn't do his history homework. In the end of the movie, the usual American ground troops marched to the empty prisoner camp. But the fact is, there were no American ground troops in China in the second world war."
2,Slow Moving -,"""Empire of the Sun"" stars a 13 year old Christian Bale in his big movie debut. He shows great talent at a young age and the story is admirable but seemed slow and tedious. The location is Shanghai, which had not changed much from the World War II scenario of the movie.Christian plays Jim, a British expatriate who is separated from his parents when the Japanese army invades Shanghai during World War II. He goes back to his beautiful home to wait for his mother, and after months (as shown by the swimming pool evaporating away) he is starving since most of the food in the house has been eaten.Jim eventually is interned in a civilian prison camp and becomes sort of a mascot. John Malkovich plays his prison buddy. The story is somewhat interesting, and Jim has a wild imagination that gives some interest. The ""Empire of the Sun"" is based on a real-life autobiography and Steven Spielberg directs."
4,Beautifully made film,"This is a beautifully photographed film. It's set during WWII, but instead of the usual soldier story, it is the story of a young British boy living in Shanghai with his family prior to the war. After briefly showing his priviledged life before the war, it then follows his life during the war after he is separated from his parents. it is an interesting movie about his survival and it is based on a true story."
5,Excellent story,"I just finished watching this film and really enjoyed the setting in Shanghai when the war started there. How this boy survived is well told and excellent graphics. Put it in your watch list, you will enjoy it."
4,An unbiased opinion ;-),"This movie is great! It was really well done, from scripting to filming. I enjoyed every aspect of it.."
2,Ibarely sweet,You have to use a lot to taste the sweetness. I used it in my mueslii and I had to use almost one eighth of the bottle evem when adding sugat. I didn't like it at all. The bottle did not last one week. instead i bought monk fruit to go at wal-mart and use it with sugar and that works great.
2,"too basic, not enough info","Based on the high ratings, I ordered this book as my endo has been getting worse and I wanted to read about any new treatments. This book was a basic level primer in how to deal with any chronic illness--not at all what I was looking for."
3,Just Average,"Well, I had read other reviews on this product before I purchased. I have coarse hair on my chin and it does not remove it all, I still have to tweeze afterwards to get all the hairs. It works great on fine hairs and yes, it does hurt so be prepared. Leaves bumps and ingrown hairs on my chin, so not the miracle product I was looking for. Time to take the plunge and buy a NoNo hair removal system..."
3,"Works well, but watch out--quality control seems to be iffy.","I ordered the emjoi epilator ap 9lc to replace an ancient Epilady I'd had since epilators for facial hair first came on the market. It worked so much better than my old one--faster, longer-lasting, and no more painful--that I was delighted and ordered another for a vacation home.However, the first one stopped working after 12 months. SInce it was still under warranty, I returned it to the manufacturer for repair or replacement. Since I was told that could take up to a month, I ordered a 3rd one through Amazon; that one arrived yesterday and didn't work at all on three different sets of batteries (all tested first). I now have to return that to the vendor, which is time-consuming and annoying, not to mention the shipping fee, which comes to over 25% of the purchase price and which the vendor won't refund (the vendor only pays for the cost of the return, via an RNA label).Bottom line: Good product, poor quality control."
3,Does not work as expected,"I am very disappointed in this product. Hair regrowth is not delayed for weeks as promised which tells me that the stubborn hair is not pulled out from the roots. This product is not worth the money, I am doing better with just a plain pair of tweezers."
5,Amazing eplilator for the face,"When I read that this was for the face, I thought I'd try it. Wow, it's great for the price. I thought it would hurt badly, but it's not very painful (it hurt much more on the arm than on the face). I have only been using it short time, but I'm very impressed. Since the batteries will need replacement, I decided to order rechargeables."
2,Way below the expectations!!,"Even though the price of this product is less, the quality is also very bad. It hurts a lot and it doesn't remove the hair completely. Its not meant for removing hair from face. I would rather buy an expensive one than waste money on this. After all you are spending on your skin!!I gave two star for its price only!!"
3,"It works, but be prepared...","This is my first time using a product like this. On my chin, where I'm use to plucking, it worked great and didn't hurt at all. But on my upper lip and around the sides of my mouth it hurt like crazy. Not only did it leave me splotchy red and sore afterward, it has caused me to break out in dozens of tiny pimples all around my mouth and upper lip - where I never break out! It's the weirdest thing and I can't understand why it would cause this to happen, but it's making me think twice about using it anywhere but my chin."
3,"Ok, I guess",Didn't quite get all the hairs and I think this thing may have been breaking the hairs off rather than plucking them. I used rechargeable batteries and recharged after doing one arm. This is my first experience with one of these things and am not sure if I'm sold on the idea of them. I think I'd rather have arm hair than having mostly no arm hair with some sorter stubble growing back.
1,Worthless - removes nothing.,"I own the Braun Silk-epil Expressive Epilator and I'm happy with it. But, I wanted a small one for more delicate areas (i.e. under arms & bikini). Unfortunately, this one didn't remove a thing. The tweezer head is curved (vs. straight across) and unless you have long hairs to pluck, this won't do a thing for you. I'm familiar with epilating and tried every which way to get it to work, but to no avail. I printed out my return label & I'm heading to the post office today."
5,I love it!,"My face has a lot of black hair, and due to my problem I purchased this product. It really solved my problem forever! So easy to use! removes the hair from the root so that you experience a smooth skin! I definitely recommend this product to everyone!"
5,Love it!,"I bought this after reading the reviews saying it hurt less than the old epilators from years ago. They also said it hurt less than threading. I knew I could stand the pain on my chin, but wasn't sure about my my upper lip and under my lip. I figured it was worth a try. I had baby orajel to numb my face just in case. I didn't need it. Be sure to hold your skin tight, it gets the hair better that way and is less painful. It is not painless, but is bareable. Hurt less than threading.:)"
4,likes,works well and is painful but could not be more satisfied other than having breakouts . kind of scary to put near your face or private areas but if you follow directions and moisturize afterwards it helps a lot
2,No so good,"It seems facial hair has to be a bit long for this to actually work.So if you bought it for facial areas, maybe look for something else."
4,Good facial epilator,"This is a good little epilator for the face. I prefer the Braun for other areas, but this one works well for more sensitive areas (bikini, face). Good product."
4,It Works!,"No complaints, it works well & it has shorten my time with tweezing my unwanted hairs. I'll probably invest in a larger one in the near future now that I have tested it. The pain factor for me is minimal due to the fact that I've tweezed before and I'm use to it, but it can become very uncomfy in areas you have never plucked before. Just take you time and you see it'll diminish after a while."
4,Works Great!,"I used this epilator for my chin and upper lip and it worked really well. It's a reasonable price and it catches almost every hair. I've been plucking and waxing for years and this is so much faster, cleaner, and more efficient. It didn't get every hair, but it got most of them. I tried it again the next day for a clean up and it got the others. It really hurts (more on my upper lip than chin), but it's not any more painful than plucking or waxing. All in all, I am very happy with it.Tips: It works better, and surprisingly hurts less on shorter hair. I recommend shaving, or buffing off the hair and waiting a couple days before using the epilator."
2,OUCH!,"Okay, I expected that using this device would not be altogether painless, but- !OUCH! is an understatement. Just be prepared, oh consumer..."
4,good product,"This product works very well. I am pleased with it and the results. It is a very good value, as well. The only minor drawback is that it is a little loud, but I would not return it for that reason. Great purchase!"
1,"For each hair it removed, it left a blemish behind.","I am returning this product today. I used it on my face and for each hair it removed, it left me with a blemish. I had blemishes all over my cheeks, chin, upper lip and neck. It's been almost a week and they are finally starting to go away. I'm glad I didn't try this product any closer to my wedding date! I will go back to waxing!"
4,Convenient and handy for travel,"This epilator is convenient for travel and works well. It would be better if it came with a travel case and cleaning brush, but these are minor issues."
2,Merry Macie,"I am so disappointed! While it does a good job with peach fuzz, it doesn't want to remove the hairs that are plain enough and long enough to be tweezed with my simple little old-fashioned tweezer, so I end up doing that. I would not have purchased this product if I'd thought that I'd still have to tweeze."
5,Just loved it!,It's small & manageable. I don't think you need a more powered one like most buyers prefer. This is just perfect.
2,Did not work as well as expected based on the product reviews but it was affordable,Did not work as well as expected based on the product reviews but it was affordable in price and good size and easy to handle.
2,Bronson,"He has made so many good films, why these selections is beyond me. Next time pick better films and then I will buy again"
