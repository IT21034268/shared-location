5,The U.S. Mint and Coinage,"The book U.S. Mint and Coinage by Don Taxay is a detailed history of our mint and is in some peoples opinion (including mine) the greatest book on U.S. coins ever written! Another (out of print) book is Don Taxay's Counterfeit, Mis-Struck and Unofficial U.S. Coins. I believe that both are still available from the American Numismatic Association. This information is taken from a very old article I clipped from one of the coin newspapers. Also, I believe that no coin collectors library is in ""mint condition"" without the Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial coins by Walter Breen"
1,dont waste your money,"BE CAREFUL DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, i bougth tisproduct for my sister, and just work ONE TIME...AND AFTER THAT .. NO MORE....DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3,Notes on the Cinematographer,"Not what I expected. This book is more philosophical, than literal. I like it, but it's like reading a lot of proverbs, you cannot absorb it all, only the few that strike you at that moment."
1,Didn't Fid my vehicle as advertised.,"The product is advertised as a custom cut sunshade for a Volkswagen EOS. Unfortunately, It does not fit my car at all. It is too tall for the windshield, and the cut out for the rear view mirror is not deep enough to fit my mirror."
4,Phenomenal Compressor if you can get one undamaged.,Everything has been said before so I will only write what people care about. I got my compressor undamaged. As of this posting you have a 78% chance of getting one undamaged.I give it 4 stars if you don't know anything about compressors because the manual really does suck. If you won't need a manual I give it 5 stars.
1,I'll let you know when I get a chance to use it!,"After reading 45 reviews, most of which described the unit arriving damaged in one way or another, it would have been wise on my part to find a source for this compressor where I could pick it up. I was hopeful my experience might be different.When it arrived, the crankcase cover (aluminum) was cracked, causing oil to coat much of the unit. The inside of the box was oil soaked as well.It would appear that the sight glass for the oil level protrudes beyond where it could be protected from impact.My guess is, even if the replacement unit arrives O.K., I would feel the need to somehow protect it from damage in the field."
1,UPS really sucks!!!,"I think Amazon just don't pay attention to the customers'feedbacks concerning shipping. I bought my Makita and it came with a big HOLE in the box, exposing the inside tubing and metal parts! I had to return the unit and had Amazon resend a new unit. What a hassle! It should be delivered via crate for better protection or dump UPS and find another more COMPETENT shipper."
5,RAD DUDE 1,"I received this compressor in excellent condition, except for a little external packaging damage. I am totally pleased with this unit's performance in my home workshop. It does everything that I need and then some. A close friend of mine has a comparable Dewalt unit, and both of us have noticed that the Makita is substantially quieter, which is very important in small enclosed work area such as mine. I highly recommend this compressor to anyone who is a home hobbist or for less demanding construction site applications. Also, it was delivered to my home sooner than the projected delivery date,... a big plus, for an impatient soul like me. Thanks again. GJM"
4,"Great product, but read return policy!","Compressor does not work and Amazon does not accept returns on this product. They should not sell products that cannot be returned if they are faulty. Proceed with caution when buying any product on Amazon if it cannot be returned! Read the fine print on returns!Update 7/15/2012: Bought a second one of these and it works great. Only problem is that if it does not work, you cannot return it to Amazon."
4,Almost Great!,"This replaced a Dewalt 55155 that was stolen. It gets dragged in and out of my work trailer. Broke air filter putting in trailer first day. Replaced it and broke another 3 months later. It's just not protected and can't take much abuse. I posted my fix in photo on description page.My assessment:Pros:Amazingly quietCompactRuns slower than mostSeems well madeCons:Air filter is vulnerableOn/off/pressure switch hangs out other side, but hasn't been a problemFor my use, Dewalt was a really nice configuration, but no longer made. I love this thing's lack of noise. I'd reccomend it and would purchase again. A protective hoop on each end would be nice for folks that use it like me. I would have purchased its bigger brother with the wheels and folding handle, but couldn't accomodate the extra height in trailer."
5,Great Purchase,"This compressor is quiet and totally vibration free. I have used it to run high power framing nailers, flooring nailers, two roofing nailers at once, even used it to do automotive grade painting. My old pancake compressor used to vibrate all over the floor and the noise would deafen you. This Makita is a heavy duty well engineered product. Great purchase."
1,Xerox a library book would be better --- negative 2 stars,"This is a horrible publication. The idea of white space, headings, scene and act divisions is totally absent. It doesn't even have breaks for the preface, or titles to mark the change from the end of the first play to the beginning of the second. This book contains no table of contents or index, and Ibsen's famous prefaces are just thrown into the mix.This product would be worth $3-4, because it does contain the words of Ibsen. For $20, I would expect it to look like a real book.Whoever thinks this does tribute to long forgotten works, needs a slap in the face."
4,Aspiring artist,Nuria was great in the show Operacion Triunfo. Her flamenco style gave her a thumbs up in Spain. This cd is flamenco and ballads and very nice. Her voice is angelic. And the song brisa de esperanza is great. Try it out.
2,"Go in sequence, please like Joe says!","I Absolutely agree with Joe Sixpack who wrote in and rightfully pointed out that Sesame Street, which began in '69 (Along with Mr. Rogers Neighborhood which started a little earlier) should be released chronologically just like every other TV sitcom/series that is being issued out there today; it just makes more sense and is easier to follow. Joe is right on the mark, too, mentioning that the older Sesame shows are superior efforts overall to the modern ones (80's and newer) with no didsy Elmo. A good portion of the buying public, especially for these older shows, are purists - CTV, are you listening????"
1,Rubbish,i bought this book with high hopes as it is assumed that a good agency like elite would be able to produce a very good book. Unfortunatly i was wrong-there was no interesting information in this whole book and only took me about 20 minutes to read; not good value for money
2,Costume Shoot,The title of this disc is a misnomer. Joanie is never actually nude. She is in a photo shoot with various costumes accentuating particular body parts typical of Playboy magazine. Disappointing.
5,Dora movie,My 5 year old loves this movie and watches it over and over so it was a good investment and a reasonable price too.
1,WHERE IS IT,"I ordered this on the 15th of November, its now the 21st of December and I still have NOT gotten this..."
4,IT'S A HOOT,"BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN, WHO ABSOLUTLY LOVE IT. TROUBLE WITH IT IS AFTER A WHILE THE ADULTS AND KIDS ARE HAVING A TUG-A-WAR OVER THE MIKE. I DROPPED A STAR IN OVERALL BECAUSE IT ONLY COMES WITH ONE MIKE (OURS DID) AND IT COULD USE ADDITIONAL SONGS."
1,awful. this is is not karaoke,I just purchased this game and I am very disappointed.I thought this was supposed to be a karaoke game but the original artist voices cannot be muted!This defeats the whole purpose of the game!
4,"A ""rare gem"" indeed!","Though not a frequent reader of books of this genre, I was thoroughly won over by this charming story! The vivid characters and setting are well developed as is the plot, making ""A Rare Gem"" a captivating and enjoyable read. I also appreciated the subtlety and sophistication of the romantic plotline, which makes this a suitable book for a wide age range, from young teens to more ""mature"" audiences. I look forward to a sequel!"
1,Looking for a refund,"Hey, Jesus acquired all his spiritual insight in the East AND, you've just entered the Twilight Zone. If E.C.P. had a little deeper understanding of the Old Testament and how it predicts and plans for the coming of Messiah (in more ways than I can count), she would (I hope) never attempt to foist this stuff on rational readers. Sigh..."
1,Did Mr Leckie read Polybius or Livy when reading Classics?,"Even worse than Hannibal, if you can believe. Where to begin... Scipio's mother did not die in childbirth of Scipio's brother Lucius (she'd have had a damned hard time making togas for the pair 20 years on if she had). Lucius did not commit suicide and Scipio hear of it, Lucius announced Scipio's death in the Senate at his trial. Can a man who was ""known by his troops to have a fondness for beautiful women"" and who committed adultery with his serving maid be gay? Or in denial of his gayness? Bloody unlikely.So many historical innacuracies,so little fact. Mr Leckie's artistic license should be revoked. Doesn't cover historical events until Pg 280 and then at such a speed any sense of accomplishment is lost. Tosh of the first order, avoid if a serious scholar of history, along with the prequel Hannibal.Can I give it less than one star please?"
2,Vet said this product is not effetive,Buy at your own choice but I would recommend consulting with your vet before making the purchase. My vet told me that this product has not been proved to be effective.
5,really!!!!!!!!!!,"both of these movies for one low price,brand new in blu ray!fn awesome!love these movies.good for a cold winter day to get blazed and watch a movie,lol"
3,pretty good,"Earlimart is a great band, especially with their new sound. This EP introduces this new evolution from typical punk rock into a more sensible digital sound. This was continued with overwhelming success on their 2003 album Everyone Down Here. Compared to EDH, Avenues is quite uninteresting and quite short (only 12 minutes). I recommend skipping this EP and going straight into their full album (which is still short) unless you can find Avenues used for $3 or less."
3,OK for $20,Overall the book is average. It teaches the interface and different uses of Dreamweaver adequately. On the negative the database examples wore based on MS Access &#61516; and this does not translate to MySQL. The programming examples wore bases in ASP so that sucked for me. This book would be good for people that are interested in using it in conjunction with access and asp development. If you are interested in using for anything else look else where
1,"Please, Author. Don't write this kind of book.",This book has lots of unnecessary screenshots and repeated comments. It costs $20 but worth nothing. Don't waste you time to read it. Even don't borrow it from your library.
1,Wedding Favors,"This book was not very informative. If you have a good eye for decorating and a minimum of taste, this book was a waste of time. It's feeled with very limited ideas. The book is a rip-off. Don't waste your money buying it. I would send it back, but the postage alone, cost more than the purchase."
2,Not as good as the book cover,"Overall, not as good as what I have expected. If you really want to make your own wedding favors, I found Martha Stewart website comes in very handy."
5,Ryobi 18 Volt Battery Pack,This is the exact battery to replace worn batteries. It works well and has been put under some extreme conditions.I usually run through a charge or two each day. It has worked now for about 6 months with this type of abuse.
5,Ryobi Battery Pack Review,"It's a shame when we have to replace the battery packs for power tools, but when required, it's good to have a quality source. This battery pack promises to be just that. While it may be a little early to predict longevity of this pack, initial usage would indicate solid performance."
1,SIZE MATTERS,I was not pleased with these shorts. The sizing is totally off. I ordered a size 12 and I don't think a size 2 person could have fit them.
2,Shockingly Bad!,"Hard Rock Casino is one of the poorest casino games I've ever played. Character options are limited to 5 different characters, there are no tournament options, and 5 card draw is the only poker offered! The game pace is painfully slow and most table limits are entirely too low.Buy Hoyle instead."
1,Overpriced and limited use,"This product comes with two filters (specifications unknown) and two ""gaskets"" which adhere the unit to the plane's air nozzle. In my experience, the first application worked but the second application did not stick. After changing the gasket, it still did not stick. In addition, although there is a ""centering ring"" for small nozzles, there seems to be a problem fitting the unit onto other sizes of nozzles. I will return this product because there is a problem fitting it onto plane air nozzles, the filter is probably no more effective than using tissues, the adhesive gasket has a short shelf-life, and the product is way overpriced."
5,Part one of my lens care arsenal.,"I have worn contacts for many years now but my astigmatism is so high only a few manufacturers make them in my prescription.So disposables are out of the question.And regular saline just doesn't get enough of the gunk off my lenses. I usually wear them eight hours a day.I use Clear Care and it keeps my lenses nice and fresh all day.One word of warning, don't get any of the solution on your fingers then try to put your lenses in!!!Hydrogen peroxide in your eyes = OUCH!!!Still, a great way to extend the wear of your lenses if you can't wear disposables."
4,Good music,My daughter recommended this movie. She is a country music fan. I enjoyed the movie. A little predictable. Good music. Entertaining.
3,Country Strong,"Overall this movie was good and had an easy storyline to follow. There were some dull parts, but the main actors were good and I would rate it ok."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"my bestfriend and I went to see this movie when it first came out, and I actually loved it. It is not the best movie out there but it is one to watch!"
5,AMAZING MOVIE!,"Great music - great acting - timeless story. Saw it with my teenage daughter and we bought the soundtrack after watching it. It takes you on a real journey and makes you feel - something I think a lot of films are scared to do now a days. This is a true work of ""Heart""."
4,Country Strong,Different insde look of a country star being blinded by what her fans have to say about her. Liked the acting of all actors and literally have watched this show many times for both the music and actors.
2,Country Weak,"I watched this movie because I love watching Gwyneth Paltrow act. For a movie called Country Strong, though, I expected Kelly to, somehow, rise above her troubles and come out on top, even if she quit country music to do it. But, instead of being strong, (Spoiler alert!) and after she gives a fantastic come-back performance, she kills herself. The movie didn't reflect well on the country music industry, either. This movie was not only a downer, it just didn't make sense, and I have to wonder what everyone involved was thinking it was supposed to mean. I did enjoy watching Paltrow and Hedlund perform, as they both sing so well."
2,Country Wrong!,"I really tried to give this movie a chance folks. I even watched it the whole way through. As a big fan of the late Tug McGraw I looked forward to this movie as a chance to launche his sons Tims acting career into the mainstream stratosphere; unfortunately I was sadly disapointed. This was a movie that failed because it tried to fit too many animals on one boat, the loss of a child, a failing marriage, substance abuse, rehab, country music, and more romantic story lines than a day time soap. Tim's great acting potential was hemmed in by a script that required he play the most wooden character I've seen since I watched Mr. Rogers as a kid. Although this movie was out of focus, I due look forward to Tim McGraw taking on larger more serious roles on the big screen worthy of his acting prowess."
1,boring,"Slow and boring movie. The acting was bad, the storyline never went anywhere and the woman killed herself in the end. Wasn't exactly an uplifting movie and the ending pretty much did it in. Save yourself the hours of torture and AVOID this movie."
5,GREAT MYSTERY & SUSPENSE,"I read a lot of mystery and suspense novels, romance and otherwise. I usually can guess the ending and the bad guy. Not this one. After reading this book I had to find Linda Ladd's other suspense novel ""Running Scared"" It was also excellent and has been turned into a movie. Both were GREAT books."
3,Contains Way More Cock Than Hammer,"Cockhammer is a Troma-esque horror-comedy with a lot of comedy, and very little horror. And while there is a lot of comedy, some of it is tiresome. A good bit of it is funny, however. Worth seeing once, if you are a fan of very cheap horror-comedies."
2,Face Piece Cinema,"This is one of those movies where a bunch of friends got together and had some fun. Which is what you'll have while you watch this totally inept celuloid nightmare.Drug jokes, penis jokes abound. But some clever dialogue delivered by the amature cast saves it from being a painful groaner. And frankly who doesn't like over-sexed cross-dressing demons. That scene, featuring some dileriously bad special effects, was truely a highlight.For fans of bad movies who won't resist reciting the dialogue days later."
5,Dazzling Work of Fiction(?),"One of the reasons this story is so tantalizing is that there exists rumors and semi-evidence of several ""fifth"" Gospels. The story had several unique features - from the reprinted ""Gospel"" to the political aspects (far-fetched) to the addresses by God (""We think..."").I have often thought this would make an excellent movie on the order of Sagan's ""Contact"" but in retrospect I can see Hollywood introducing sex, emphasize the change of locales and the chase and downplay the intellectual/religious aspects of the story. If a theater cannot show Kazanzaki's ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (a soaring, beautiful work) then how could they show a tale that purports that Jesus never rose from the dead?The writing is just superb, the research impressive, and even the footnotes within the Gospel seemed to enhance instead of detract from the saga. Buy this for a snowy weekend and enjoy."
4,Great till the End,"Barnhardt does perhaps make the book a bit too long, but scholarly approach he takes is engaging. The footnotes were extremely fascinating and added, rather than detracted, from the novel. That said, I just did not buy Lucy's decision at the end of the book. Not so much that she made the decision, but rather the relative ease by which she made the decision. The character agonized over so many things, but this, one of the most important choices one could make, she appears to do it easily. And this is coming from a pro-choice reader. I can understand that Barnhardt wanted to make a statement about the issue, but he could have done so with more believability if he developed her character's decisionmaking further."
5,Exactly what you expect!!,"When I saw this product I thought I was gonna get a not so good system and that was the reason for it been affordable. But boy was I wrong!! This product is solid, made out of good materials and it delivers the message in a mega effective way!! Not only that it looks good, but it works right on. I was a little hesitant when I saw that it was a magnet hold item. But I tell you... It is a strong... Very strong magnet! I jump around a lot in my business (Singer). So I was so proud that at the end of the night, it was still in the same place on my shirt and it never moved an inch and averyone in the club asked me where did I get it and had some thing to say about it!!"
5,Bliss for the dogs,"Not only do my dogs find these jerky treats delicious, they are also getting nutrients. Since these are a bit expensive, we save them for special occasions."
3,Make you own to be safe,"I've gotten to where I don't trust these companies or any company. Who knows what they get from China. I now make my own chicken jerky. Fry thinly sliced pieces of chicken breast, put in frig for two hours, blot off moisture and bake in a 150 degree oven for four hours. My dog loves it!!!"
3,good,My dad read this book back in 1984 and though it wasgood because it was honest about what was going on back then.
1,do not do business with this company,Battery advertisement was for a 7.2 volt battery which I ordered. The charger I had for my old 7.2 battery didn't fit the new battery. The ad failed to notate there were two different 7.2 batteries and two different chargers. Customer service very rude actually nasty wouldn't take back even though returns were guaranteed.I would never do business with this company again!!!!
4,awesome!,I take my dogs hiking with me on the weekends and this is a great accompaniment to my gear. I was toting around Tupperware that took up a lot of room in my bag. This folds up and fits in my bag great.
2,Wooden tee alternative,"At roughly $2 per tee, this is an expensive alternative to conventional wooden tees. For a beginner, it may help with consistent tee height. However, the durability of the tee is lacking. The bristles tend to deform after repeated use. A case is included that helps the tee maintain its shape and a ball marker is integrated into the cap.Regarding performance, I see no perceivable increase in distance. In windy conditions the ball has a difficult time staying on it. It is hard to drive the tee into the hard winter ground.Overall, there are better values for conventional tee alternatives.The advantage of this deal is that you get a subscription to a golf magazine, for now."

4,compelling,"I finally watched THE BRIDGE tonight and found it to be very well-done, sensitive, and thoughtful, even though the subject matter was so disturbing and so very sad.The comments by family and friends were heart-rending and painful to watch..... and seeing their palpable grief and even anger certainly gave me a lot of food for thought. That interview with the young man who survived.....when he said that as soon as he let go he knew he wanted to live.....well, that just gave me goose bumps. In those few seconds, he actually was able to re-adjust his body and its trajectory to increase his chance of survival.What could easily have been sensationalism -- because this subject is usually taboo --- instead was a eulogy and an investigation into the reasons for suicides.This documentary was provocative and troubling on many levels, with subject matter and haunting images that I will be thinking about for a long time."
4,Review of The Bridge,"This was an amazing movie about a very disturbing topic. Eric Steele was able to capture the essence of these troubled individuals in such a decent way. If you purchase the movie, be sure to watch the separate interviews with the staff members who filmed along with Mr. Steele."
3,The Bridge was not what I expected...,but better. I don't want to spoil it for anyone.. but you have to be in the right state of mind to watch it. It helps you to understand the human condition and how lucky we are to be happy and able to cope with everyday life.
4,House from Wisconsin,I viewed this on HBO and bought it for a therapy group I lead. This particular group is homeless veterans. Suicidal ideation is quite common with this population. The ones that needed to see this the most were quite taken with this dvd. The post discussion lasted longer than I anticipated. They identified with the people in the movie and spoke about similar feelings they had experienced. Good therapy.
3,Wish Had more problems,The only thing missing is at end of chapters there are no exercises where you can put all the concepts learned into one program. They have good explanation and exercises to explain concepts but it would have been nice if they had complete programs as exercises at the of chapters to test your knowledge of all the concepts learned.
4,a must have for a TMBG fan,"the combo is a good deal, first. also the songs are very catchy -- for all ages. the puppets are not my favorite thing but the john & john variety are cute. it would have probably been better w/out the disney backing but, hey, every child should learn tidbits from TMBG even if it is slightly watered down, right?!"
1,"Not as great as ""Here Come the 123's""","We bought ""123s"" first, and thought our little one would love ""ABCs"" as well, but it just reminded us of a 70's rock cartoon...this one didn't have the animation and catchy tunes that ""123s"" has. The songs are slow and mellow and the animation leaves a lot to be desired."
5,catchy songs,"I wanted some new music for a 6 hour car drive we have coming up as a family. This was filled with a bunch of upbeat songs, and I'm sure it will become one of our favorites. We already have the TMBG Here Come the 123s, so we knew this would be another hit. And it is!"
3,"Wanted to Give an A+, But It Only Earns a C","I bought this and Here Come the 123s for my son after falling in love with No! I'm a huge TMBG fan and really expected more from this album. The songs are mostly passable, but really sound a lot more like straight-up kids music without that flair that the band has always shown in all their work (for kids or adults). The songs are a bit too forced and the sheer number of short tracks gives the feel of cranking out a bunch of tunes to fill the CD. Many of the songs were written for Disney Playhouse segments and meant to go along with visuals (which is why there is a DVD included). The end result feels like a random collection of odds and ends instead of a fun wonderful kids album like No! A few songs capture that unique feel, like ""E Eats Everything"" and ""I C U"" but mostly it plays more like a ""wacky"" kids album for kids. Three stars for that, but I was hoping for something I would enjoy as well instead of merely tolerating."
5,Here Come the ABCs [CD/DVD Combo],What a great DVD and CD. My 2 year old loves the songs and so does my wife and I. My son sings along with every song. He likes to listen to the CD while in the car going to daycare and enjoys watching the DVD anytime. I enjoy listening and watching it too. I recommend this for all toddlers; young and old.
5,Excellent!,"We love the DVD and the music. TMBG is very clever in their music writing, and they make the music fun and enjoyable for kids and grown ups alike. There's great variety in the style of music, and it's all educational, so that's a plus. Our family of 4 highly recommends ABCs and 123s!"
5,No Barney music in our house!,"My husband and I were TMBG fans in college, so I can't even say how excited we were to be able to buy a ""kids"" CD/video that we could enjoy just as much as our children! The video is especially good, with the diversity of graphics/live action and all the catchy songs. My kids are 3 & 1, and you're selling your kids short if you don't think they can learn their ABC's in the unique way they're presented by TMBG. I know we feel soooo fortunate to be able to buy all the GREAT music out there being marketed towards kids. Some other favorites in our house are Dan Zanes, Ella Jenkins, and Justin Roberts. And don't over-look all the great compilations out there, we've almost worn out our series from the ""Land of Nod"" which have some great oldies like Woodie Guthrie....They're all on my iPod!!"
4,Love TMBG,This is a great DVD/CD for kids. I only wish I had discovered it sooner. I've been a fan of They Might Be Giants since Flood and they continue to impress me.
4,Our New Favorite!,This is my son's new favorite DVD. (I have to limit him to once per day.) He's 22 months and already singing the ABCs and learning his letters. The songs are cute and original. There are several bonus songs at the end of the DVD which do not involve letters and are basically the band jamming in a room somewhere. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that some of the graphics could be a little better...kind of like old-school Sesame Street. Overall...highly recommended!!!
1,Not impressed,"I was hoping to use this DVD as an aid to teach my toddler alphabets, but was not impressed with the DVD. I prefer Leapfrog letter factory which is entertaining and educational"
2,"""Out Of Order ABCs""","I feel that for ABCS to become giants, first of all of there has to be order! Generally, children are eager to learn and are fast learners. From Pre-school thru the early Elementary grades, the alphabets are taught in sequential order from A-Z. This DVD skips carelessly about and randomly selects out of order letters from the alphabets as they are presented in song. It is definitely not a great DVD for beginning learners. I would be equally afraid to order the giant numbers DVD created by the same publishers for fear of it producing numbers that are totally out of order as well! Don't be disappointed, find a DVD that's simple and repetitious for early learners if you want success."
3,not as good as here come the 123's,"It is along the same vein as here come the 123's, but just a bit more...'out there.' Maybe it will grow on me; it does have some clever songs on it"
3,"Not as good as ""here come the 1,2,3s""","I found the ""Deeply Felt Puppet Theater"" songs to be annoying, and my 14-month old doesn't like them as much as the TMBG songs. Unlike the 1,2,3s, in which every song is good, this one only has a few gems. E eats everything, alphabet lost and found, flying V, and Can you find it? were good."
2,Disappointing,"I was a big TMBG fan in the '80s, and was psyched to hear some of their fun kids' stuff. This sounds like they sort of phoned it in. There are a couple of okay songs, and a bunch of filler that I think is just bad sounding and not clever. My 3 year old does seem to like it (especially Go for G and E Eats Everything), but I can see the CD getting annoying fast. (Also, did it not occur to them that having toddlers running around saying ""Q U !"" might be misinterpreted . . . ?). Sadly, I think this might be one to just buy a couple of the individual songs on amazon or itunes, if they are available individually."
4,A Good Find!,"When we went on vacation, we left our son's giraffe in the hotel by accident. He was upset to find that the toy was missing. I was very pleased to find a giraffe that was very similiar to the one that we had lost. Our son was so happy when ""Gerry the Giraffe"" returned on our doorstep."
3,Looks better than other tables but chips easily,"I like the modern look of the table but have some complaints. It has limited storage, the actual top is a little flimsy and the sides chip very easily. It looked a little beat-up even right after we assembled. I guess it didn't even handle shipping that well, so hopefully your toddler is going to be easy on it!"
3,HUGE,"I know they gave the measurements when I ordered it, but this table is giant. It takes up half of my son's room. Not to mention that you have to pull it out from the wall in order for him to play with his trains. Overall it's a good table, my husband had trouble putting it together because a lot of the hardware was not fitting correctly. The quality of the table seems good so far."
5,great for trains,"perfect table for train set for my two year old son. It was a little harder to put together than expect and the drawer doesn't glide very easily, but overall very pleased with purchase."
4,A nice gift for my grandson...,"This table was shipped from the retailer. It went to my grandson's house and it was easy for his parent's to put together. It is attractive and sturdy and he uses it for a variety of games and toys. The toughest thing is to keep him off of the table, for some reason he thinks he must climb on it (his 2 year old sister also) but the table has withstood the wear and tear."
5,activity table,I bought it for my grandson and my son thinks it is wonderful. Santa brought him the Melissa & DOug train set so this works perfectly.
5,Gift for a 3 year old,"This was a gift for my nephew's 3rd birthday. He loves it and so do his parents.I had previously seen it in use in a preschool,where the kids there loved it too."
2,Not the quality I expect from Melissa & Doug,"We ordered this activity table because it was large and had a plain green top. We prefer KidKraft products but their activity table did not meet our requirements. We have other Melissa & Doug products and were expecting something better. The table is rickety (no cross bracing) and some of the hardware to put it together was machined incorrectly. One of the wood pieces had a huge knot in it which compromises the integrity of the piece. Their quality control was lacking. That said, for $100, I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Horrible Construction Experience,"My husband spent over two hours assembling the table. At one point, finding no less than two pieces or hardware damaged beyond use, he took out his screw gun to assemble the pieces with his own hardware. Our 2.5 y/o son will love playing with his table, but it was incredibly frustrating trying to assemble this on Christmas Eve."
4,Pleased with Amazon!,I was very very happy with the price and especially happy to receive the book before the promised time! Thanks!
3,Happy with the book but not the CD-ROM,"I have recently purchased this book and still reading it. My only disappointment is the CD-ROM, I didn't know we need to have the SAS software in order to use the CD-ROM. So I can only read the book but can't use the CD-ROM."
1,Blew Dust Everywhere! Very poor design,"This one is going back to the store. I don't care if it was only $60. It is definitely a beast with a powerful suction and very loud motor...but....it has a serious design flaw. The exhaust (which is VERY POWERFUL) vent is on the front of the vacuum. Consequently even though it sucks up some things it blows dust,cat hair, etc., all around such that as soon as you've vacuumed something it's still dirty. And let me tell you - that motor makes the dust fly. I was vacuuming the living room and the head was just pointed towards the kitchen and I could still see the dust flying. Not bad on carpet, unfortunately 90% of our house is wood or tile."
2,Disappointing,"This is our second dirt devil. The first one gave us a few good years of solid service, so when it finally gave up, we didn't hesitate buying another dirt devil. This was a mistake! As other reviewers point out here, this vacuum literally makes your cleaning job harder. It blows crumbs and dust around in front of the vacuum BEFORE they can be vacuumed up. It COMPLETELY defeats the purpose for which it is intended. We returned ours after a few days of pulling our hair out and bought a more expensive model. Avoid!"
4,Pretty good considering the price,"I think that for the price of this machine ($75 Can), this is a great vacuum. I have gone through 4 vaccums within 2 years, all have bit the dust for no apparent reason (all eureka products too I might add). I have low pile carpet and a dog who sheds and this vacuum seems to suck everything up right away.I have not had any problems like the others have mentioned. Dust bunnies are sucked up and kept in place in the canister. Sure, its loud, but what vacuum isn't? Its quite powerful and does the job. The reason why I didn'tgive it a 5 star is because the base of it is a wee bit wide for my liking and to switch it to hose is a bit of a pain, but its totally worth it."
5,Allston Does it Again,"Personally, I think that Aaron Allston is one of the best writers of the Star Wars books, right next to Timothy Zahn (Yes, that's what I said!) This book had everything in it. I kid you not when I say that I was actually laughing out loud at some parts in the book! Allston really gets into it, and as it was with some of his older Star Wars books, he focuses on space battles mainly, but there's plenty of plot all over the place to keep your mind more than occupied. There are no major developments in the entire storyline, but this book was GREAT nonetheless. So, as if you couldn't tell, it's definitely a great read, and I highly recommend it."
4,A good look at PhotoDraw 2000!,"Overall, this was the most solid PhotoDraw 2000 resource I could find. Good writing, nice sample images, and it covers pretty much every aspect of the program in enough detail to satisfy me. Well worth the money!"
4,Good Overall Manual,The manual covers many topics and is great for general purposes. The illustrations on disassembly / reassembly could have been clearer and more detailed. Good starting point though...
5,fabulous 70's reggae,"This is by far some of the purest roots music available from that special time in reggae music the mid 1970's . To be exact 1976 which also gave us ""Legalize it "" by the legendary Peter Tosh . Justin Hinds delivers his music in a spiritual rootsy method and ""Jezebel"" is by far his greatest album with 2 of his tunes used in the famous movie ""Rockers"" and included in the movie soundtrack compilation . This cd includes two albums that were previously to my knowledge not released in cd format before . All in all I would recomend this to any serious collector of classic reggae from its premier era . Justin Hinds remains true to the art form still today . PEACE"
5,"Fast, well-built","Xerox Phase 6360DN Laser Printer is extra-fast and well-built. It is loud, big and heavy. If you can handle these issues, buy it. The speed is amazing with long documents. The print quality is great. I have not tried printing photos. It does very well with computer screen shots and presentation style graphics."
4,Very good,I enjoyed this book and thought that Thomas Reid picked up rather well where Byers left off. I missed some of the irony and comical bits in the story (like Quenthel's whip making funny remarks)but over all it was a good book and I enjoyed it immensly.
2,ok,"This book was like a great date that didn't put out. It left me expecting more,but didn't deliver. The cover picture was the best part."
2,"Well, If It Worked...","I suppose I'd probably love this item for my baby ... IF IT WORKED. Arrived DOA. I'm going to buy a fresh a battery for it - see if that helps. If not, it's going back to Amazon."
1,Only worked for a week,"We bought this therm from a store here in the city, for a lot more then it is priced here. Used it about three times before the display went crazy and you could not read the numbers any more. Unfortunatly we threw away the packaging so in the garbage went the therm also."
1,worked for only one illness,This thermometer worked fine... for one illness but then only one month later when I went to use it it was completely dead. Disappointed.
5,easy to use,"Even with a fussy, wiggling, unhappy sick baby this was easy and felt safe to use. This is a great thermometer. You ALWAYS need to get a rectal temperature for your baby. Don't waste your time with anything else."
1,Great rectal probe...that's it!,"If your doctor suggests using the thermometer as a probe to help your baby pass stool, then this is a great product for you. But if you want a thermometer that you can actually wash after sticking it in your child's rectum, then save your money. After ONE use, we rinsed this off (didn't even submerge), and the display is broken and appears to have liquid in it."
5,good service,I am a huge fan of stand up comedy and although this wasn't as funny as I hoped. I got the product on time and in excellent condition. Would order from this company again.
2,Typical Plastic Chair,"Nice chair, no real special features over any other $70-90 chairs.The armrests are cheap plastic with an small internal metal plate to reinforce the screws.Unfortunately, I'm a tall person, and when I lean back in these chairs too much (as I often do) the plastic armrests break just above the metal plate.Once one side breaks, the other side is soon to follow, and I end up snapping the chair in half.Taller/Heavier people should avoid this type of chair."
2,Write Letters,Similiar to other books.I guess I misunderstood what it was. The information offered was very redundant. I think someone might appreciate it.
2,Not Up to expectation.,"To be honest, the towel wasn't really that water ""magnet"". I personally find my old towel would do a much better job."
5,This towel really works,This towel really works i bought one about 6 months ago and the same day i got it i used it and it really does soak up all the water. I dried my mini van with about one. I have regretted of buying only one so last week i ordered three more towels to help dry two other cars. This is a great product and maguiars did a great job of creating it.
5,Great to dry your car after a car wash!,This works well when I take my 2013 BMW 328 to the dealership for a free car wash! It doesn't dry my car all the way and dont want it to leave streaks so I just ordered Magnet Drying towel and it does great! It did soak up water I think if I was hand washing my car this would be a bad towle! But take it though the car wash and have the fan try and dry as much as it can then this will work great!!!
2,Ballet or Play?,"This was loosely a ""ballet"". There was very little dancing and I don't think the male lead danced more than a minute in the 1st act and hardly any in the 2nd act. The scenery was very nice as were the costumes. The dancing was mediocre at best. It was a total waste of time, but apparently the Danish are the only ones who do this ballet and this is the only production. Now I know why. this ballet is all fluff. the 3rd act is the only one I can say is ballet because there was actually dancing. Although, it did seem amateurish, it was ok.The male lead finally dances in the 3rd act also, but it's horrible and all over the place. Luckily, I didn't buy this, but rented it from netflix. boy, am I glad I didn't waste my money!"
1,Don't expect to pass the test using only these books,"These books contain many many errors, and do not cover everything that is on the test. If you want to pass the exams on the first try get the Microsoft self-paced books and the Microsoft Readiness Review books, the answers are correct and most correlate directly to the test. And NO I do not work for Microsoft, I got 866/1000 on NT Workstation, after giving up on the ""Cram"" series as the junk that it is...."
4,lyric movement,"I first discovered Nils Okland from the British electronica group Underworld's web site, Dirty.org. While Nils covers new territory for contemporary classical music, this work also, in some ways, resonates with the work of the ""indie"" group Dirty Three. Understated and subterranean. You'll not be disappointed if what you seek is thoughtful, ruminative, sometimes meandering, movements of sound."
4,Memories,"""Beach Baby"" is a classic. It is the only reason I bought the CD. I had no expectations of the rest of the CD. It is pleasant and nostalgic, though. It is high school all over again each time I listen to ""Beach Baby""!"
2,repellent and plodding,"What an awful book. I was hoping there might be some other explanation for what was going on, like that Lionel had some sort of guilt about making love to her etc. but how this passes for a romance is beyond me. No hero would ever allow his wife to be treated so. Rape is rape.How she could then fall in love with him is ridiculous. What happened to the lovely little intelligent girl in love with Robin her step-brother in the first book in the series?Grim and plodding, lots of slow bits. Tries to be sensational but the love scenes are all so flat and she frequently repeats herself. I want a book about the magic of falling in love, even with obstacles, not the bitter cynicism of the 'heroes' she has been producing in her last few books."
2,Bad Science,"Instead of testing deduced hypotheses against data, the author looked for patterns in the infinite mess of reality that sort of fit the template provided by the Bible. Maybe I missed something, but this isn't satisfactory in science. The book is still fun to read, in the same way that it's fun to read horoscopes."
1,Pseudo-scientific garbage.,"Another christian apologist who is not very good at science appeals to those who are not good at science either. If you really want to know the scientific position on the origins of the universe, abiogenesis, evolution, genetics, geology, do yourself a favor, and pick up books on those topics by actual scientists."
3,Trying to meld Kabalah and science,"Dr. Schroeders books are generally well written. Scientific facts are generally presented clearly and just enough without going too much into the deep. However, he leans too much on the Kabalah and 'traditional' interpretations. This tendency detracts from his material for those from Christian or Jewish backgrounds who uphold the Bible or Torah as the supreme writings to believe. His hypothesis of the age of the universe mapped into the six days of Genesis was given enough coverage but is still tenuous as the equations themselves cannot be proven 100%."
2,Interpreting the Bible so that it fits science,"This book is full of a lot of great scientific information, however the author's real purpose is to fudge both science and the Bible so that it appears they are one in the same. The author says in the first chapter that he will not try to fudge the Bible so it fits with science yet that's all he does throughout the entire book. His connections are unlikely to convince the average intelligent reader. But don't take my word for it, if you chose to read this book then try this: After every conclusion he makes about the Bible and Science ask yourself 'Does this evidence support the idea that the Bible is true, or is it merely a way of reading the Bible so that it loosely fits scientific fact'."
1,Original on Blue Velvet?,"I think you will find the version in the soundtrack ""Blue Velvet"" to be the original, at least run time is correct, but have not listened to it...original run time is 2:36 or 2:37 and not 2:41 for the Love Letters cdditto for a Time Life compilation 2 LP box set titled ""The 60's - Rave On"", which I do own... run time was 2:37 on this lpyou should also get the correct version by getting the 7"" 45 vinyl that is still available...original 1962 7"" from ERA say 2:27, I don't think this is correct, on ebay I saw the image of 7"" label with a radio station logo stamp on it that someone had penciled in 2:36radio stations need to know correct run time."
5,"Not really basic, but an excellent cookbook","I have been cooking for over 50 years, and no longer rely solely on a written recipe. Even then, I am apt to improvise. Not so with this cookbook. I follow exactly, and have never been disappointed. I have the other two Silver Palate cookbooks, and in my opinion this is the best. I would not recommend it as a ""starter"" cookbook, one does need some experience and a basic knowledge of technique, because you won't find much in that department in this book. If I had to narrow down my cookbooks to just a precious few, this would be one of them (along with Julia Childs' ""How To Cook""-that is not a beginner's book either!). I am ordering the hardcover edition, because my paperback copy is falling apart."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I'm a fairly proficient cook. I was just looking for some ideas when I ordered this cookbook and I can't see myself making anything out side of a couple of desserts. Comparing toHarold Import 3804 HOW to Cook Everything Simple RecipesorHow to Cook Everything The Basics: All You Need to Make Great Food -- With 1,000 PhotosI would choose Mark Bittman any day of the week. I would return it, but I don't want to have to pay for shipping again. Disappointed."
5,The ONLY book you'll need!,"A short note about the brisket that didn't work for another reviewer: It is AWESOME! Simple, and excellent, I find it hard to believe that this person found a way to ruin this one. Be sure to cover tightly, but other than that this is a no-brainer and probably the simplest recipe in the book!Now, on to the book as a whole: I have enjoyed cooking for a number of years, and consider myself to be pretty good at it. This book was purchased for me by a family member who also enjoyed it, and I have to say it is probably the only one on my shelf that gets any use. Some of the recipes are simple, others complex. Good info on fruits, veggies, meats, etc. Good suggestions on wines to serve with your food, and other great serving tips! This book has seen its day in my kitchen, it's gotten so much use that i'll probably need to buy another soon.Best cookbook on my shelf!"
2,Where is the inside dry pocket?,"The Bag is very roomy, but there is no inside dry pocket, bring a hefty bag if you don't want your wallet or phone to get wet. So disappointed that there is not a dry pocket on this bag because that would put it over the the top."
2,OK shampoo,Works well to clean hair. Have not had any new growth that I or my hairdresser could see. Not planning on repurchasing.
5,Do you poop-out at parties?,"This is obviously a classic episod in my favorite show. This is my favorite episode of all time. this is about lucy getting drunk on accident while practicing her tv commercial over and over. this medicene called vitameatavegamin is supposed to help you feel secure and not poop-out at parties, w/ 13% alchahol. WATCH IT!"
3,An Interesting Experiment,"Lem creates a world so impossibly alien that the reader, while discovering so many new and wonderous things, cannot form a personal attachment to any of it. The novel is brilliant as an examination of a true 'alien' experience, but doesn't necessarily satisfy on either a strictly entertainment or academic level. An interesting experiment in sci-fi literature for those who are looking for something beyond the norm."
3,Old School Western with a Twist,"This was a classic old school western but it had a very smart story and a differnt kind of twist to the characters. What drew me to the movie was that one of my all time favorites, Sterling Hayden, was in it. Then I read that the heavy was literally the heavy Mr. French himself Sebastian Cabot. Then I read that even though it was a western Hayden played a Swedish sea captain. It is almost a noir western. Cabots top henchman is not just one dimensional either.Check out this odd but good movie. I recommend it."
3,Just an average exercise video,"The scenery is pretty, but that's about all that makes this video stand out. Ten minutes of warm up, 20 minutes of standard aerobics and 15 minutes of stretching and floor work. I was hoping there would be more step dance moves, even just a few, but there wasn't. The music is traditional Irish tunes, sung by Mr. Dunne but accompanied by light pop piano -- Irish elevator music I'd call it. The video is weird because it shows Mr. Dunne (in shorts and a polo shirt) along with his wife and the instructor (both in standard leotards, tights etc.) going through their motions in various locales in Ireland. Pretty yes, but often there are passers-by looking on within inches of the exercisers. I found myself more interested in what these people must have been thinking than in doing the workout.All in all, the workout is passable, but no better or worse than any other. Buy this one used."
5,A VeggieLover from PA!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this CD, it is sosososo cute. I have never heard anything so funny and I absolutely love the VeggieTales videos. I recommend this to people who have little kids or big kids. Hey, I'm 15 and I love those little guys."
1,Horrible!,This dvd player didn't work at all. I tried to play a dvd in it and it kept saying disk error. I called the customer service and they said to return the dvd player. I had a feeling that this was going to happen. I just hate having to go through all that trouble.
1,D.O.A.,"Worked for about one hour, always getting disc error messages. Would not recommend this player."
4,WHY NOT???,"$19.77 for a DVD player? You've got to be kidding. I took the gamble and am very glad I did. Incredibly easy to hook up - just match the colors on the cables to the ports on the TV! Sylvania even supplied the batteries for the remote control!!!!Okay - here's why 4 stars and not 5. The instruction manual is complicated and virtually useless. A vital piece of info is missing - you have to turn your TV to the proper channel for viewing a DVD. The problem is that they don't tell you which one! So, a call to the ever-open 800-customer service line at Sylvania solved the problem.Bottom line, if you want a simple DVD player with progressive scan to watch a movie, this is your best bet.To Amazon: Your shipping service was amazingly quick! It arrived the day after I ordered it."
4,"Moving ""new age"" soundtrack","Had I not seen the film, I'd have listened to this soundtrack as just another ""new age"" compilation, great for popping into the stereo while relaxing at home. Upon seeing the film, however, the music took on a whole other dimension. Quite moving and surreal, the songs will take you back to the scenes in the film, and on trackS #8 and #13 I found myself weeping. Controversies aside, you can't miss this theatre experience, but if you do, get the soundtrack to at least lose yourself in the intense feelings behind the story."
1,Judy Davis doesn't make it happen,Judy Davis does a cold impersonation. She can't convey the brilliamce and warmth that was Judy Garland.
3,Good Reference,"This book inspires the reader to get out there and profit doing something that they love. It is up to the reader to act on the suggestions in the book, if they so choose. It's a decent reference book, with details on how to get your business started, how to be successful, and where to market your projects. I would recommend it to someone who is thinking about starting their own crochet business, but I would not suggest using this as a sole reference, as there are many other books out there that can be used in conjunction with this one."
3,Ghosts of Frank Yerby,"I took a long time to get through this book. I lugged it about the country on my motorcycle tour of the US Heartland. I found the book to be a bit of roller coaster in its pace. It is well written, but the pace varies. Most of the action oriented writing clicks right along. The emotionally driven elements slowed things down. It is a woman's book. As with most women writers that I have read, there is a lack of authenticity when it comes to violence. The anthropomorphism about the horse, Bonniedoone, did not capture the wildness or genuine psychology of horses.The characters were moderately well developed and the writing style was clear and clean. The Scottish brogue was enchanting. There were elements of the style of Frank Yerby that I found very appealing.I look forward to more books by this author."
2,Not Laguna Beach!,"I really didn't care for this cast that is supposed to be replacing the Laguna Beach series. The LB cast were a lot spoiled but weren't arrogant about it. These people seem to do nothing but sleep and go to the beach and spend money and flaunt they are rich, and oh yes, school. They all said in their little introduction thing they each did, how they were all friends forever, most having always lived there, and how loyal and solid those friendships were. Then at the end it had preview clips of the upcoming season and they all seem to backstab someone or other from what I see! I don't think this one will be programmed on my TiVo!"
4,Not bad...,"Well i was surprised they combined the first book with the 25th. This book and ""betryal"" the 24th book had just started to pick up to the good old books i used to love. I love that ed and Gaia are a little bit happy. I think it was kind of dumb of the surprise you get near the end. But overall it wasnt bad, and i look forward to the 26th and so on, and so forth. Enjoy :-)"
1,This Drive Will Fail On You,"I am blown away that so many others have had the exact expierence I have had with this drive. I was very excited to purchase it when I built a new system about a year ago. My motherboard was one of the first to support ATA100 and I paid up for the drive. Easy to install and no problems for a solid 3 months. Then I noticed when running outlook that the drive would run and make a scratching sound making it impossible to work. This scratch and run would last up to 15 minutes where you would basically be completely locked off your computer. This only happened occassionally though and I dealt with it. As of today, I tried reformatting the drive 3 times and the scratching happens 50+ times per 8 hour day. Don't buy this drive even on clearance!"
2,A beginner who thinks this DVD is not for beginners...,"I bought this DVD with hope that I would lose a few pounds and learn a little Tai Chi. I did neither.In terms of actually learning Tai Chai, this DVD falls short. I found that Mr. Cole did not give explicit instruction. It seemed that I was expected to either know the Tai Chi forms before hand, or to follow his lead and ""pick it up"". The pace of the exercises, are fast - meaning that Mr. Cole switches from one form to the other with little advanced warning or preparation. There is a nice feature on the DVD that allows you to jump to a specific form, so I guess if you chose to redo an exercise you would be able to do so relatively easily.I gave this DVD only two stars one for the quality of the DVD and the other for the artistic touches."
2,Not quite what I expected,"I am not a Tai Chi person, but the forms should be similar to most of Kung Fu. I had taken some at a gym once and the forms here are not close to the ones I had then. He is in good shape, but not sure that this is how he got that way. It is a fast paced tape, but not one that you will learn the moves from easily. Might have to play it a few times to catch on. Maybe my view is clouded, but not what I expected."
1,Don't Bother,"This might be good for a pre-teen or teenager (but then again maybe the subject matter is too adult for them). The story is so ridiculous. None of the characters are believable. It reminded me of a really bad soap opera. I can see how you could split it into 30 minute segments with a big ""cliffhanger"" at the end of many of the episodes. I borrowed the audio CD from the library and was happy I didn't pay for it. I listen to all kinds of audio books on my IPOD when I'm doing mindless work but this CD was almost too mindless."
1,A struggle to read...,"I agree with an earlier reviewer that this book is very poorly written. I picked it up to read because of previous experience with this author. This book did not deliver an enjoyable experience. Characters were not developed, dialogue was impossible to follow."
2,READ THIS BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK OF BUYING!,"Ok, I purchased this rice cooker expecting the same level of quality that has made panasonic so popular. And I must say, I am SO disappointed.Pro:- great non-stick, none of your dishes will stick to the pan and washing is a breezeCons:- the lid has no hole on top. Instead, the design is such that the whole lid wobbles off the pan when the pressure is too high, SPILLING the contents all over the counter. I have had to clean my counter (and all the stuff on it) numerous times, cursing the makers of this rice cooker.-there is a gap between the pan and the body. So when the spillage mentioned above happens, it will leave a sticky coating on the interior of the cooker itself.- again, due to the absence of a hole on top, the residue collects, not around a nice little spot, but around the ENTIRE lid.Summing up, the only reason to buy this cooker would be the pan. And after your first use, you will realize that that is simply not good enough of a reason."
4,Very cute!,"The first time I used this it boiled over a little bit. But the rice was perfect and fluffy! The bottom didn't burn at all and it is really easy to store. Even though it didn't have a ""warm"" feature, it kept the rice perfect for an hour after cooking."
1,The Cave,[[ASIN:0156028794 The Cave]writing style terrible. floats off into lala land for whole chapters such as explaining how a dog thinks. story could have been told in three chapters. too much detail. dialog jumps from charactor with no breaks or paragraphes.
2,Not Really A Novel; A Bore,"This is an allegorical work. The characters are meant as Symbols of Something Else, which is vaguely menacing. They're two-dimensional, simplistic peasant types. They could have been drawn with a lot more psychological insight, but instead, they are cardboard characters, in a staged world, and the narrative voice can put you to sleep as it moves them along. As another reviewer pointed out, the gist of the book is apparent right away, and nothing that happens changes anything. There is no suspense, no character development, nothing of particular interest except some of the narrator's observations, and those are not stellar. Even the dog isn't that sympathetic.For how this should have been written, please see One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez."
2,I'm not smart if I don't like this book,"Occasionally I come across a book that makes me feel like if I don't like it, I must be missing something. After all, the author won a Nobel Prize. So if I'm not enjoying his work, the fault _must_ be mine!But the truth is, I'm just not enjoying this book. So if that makes me dumb or wrong, then so be it!-- The book is too long and rambly for the point it's trying to make.-- The characters don't seem to experience much transformation.-- His philosophical stylings really aren't that eye-opening.-- The themes kind of hit you over the head they're so obvious.It's been a long slog through this one and I felt like I'd finished a marathon when I finally turned the last page."
4,Good,"This is an exceptionally well-written technical book. The style and content of the book reflect an author who can think clearly, explain clearly, and who is an expert on the subject. However, my criticism is that interspersed throughout out are some looooong passages passages of bla bla bla stuff. A typical one on page 69 begins ""It's hard to imagine that a case needs to be made for understanding your own code, but it's worth a few words."" The author spends a lot of time explaining the motive and philosophy behind the book. Nonetheless, if you read this book and work through the well-designed and detailed examples in it, you'll get very good at Rails programming.I think this book would be most useful to someone coming from another object-oriented language. If you're starting to learn programming or object-oriented programming, this book will confuse you. If you're already a Java developer, you'll have no problem."
5,The book I had been waiting for,"Ruby for Rails really covers how ruby and rails fit together and the idioms that derive from each.The book covers a lot of ground, some of which is only relevant to those new to OO programming, but these section can be easily skimmed. For the experienced programmer it also covers a number of Ruby features that are not basic such as singleton methods, method rebinding plus some meta tasks e.g., using 'method_missing', trapping inheritance etc.I've read two other Ruby/Rails books and they were very helpful in coding my first Ruby app last year, but they left me with many questions about how things really work.This book answered most of those questions and opened up a couple of new doors that I didn't even realize were closed."
5,heart wrenching honesty,it's difficult to imagine that one could be the subject of any one of the poems recounting love unrealized and not yearn to reach out and make the pain go awaybeautiful and bravee
4,Time Capsule of late 1960's Troubador Rock & for Olivia Newton John fans,"John Farrar spent most of the next phase of his career writing and producing songs for Olivia Newton-John including most of her massive hits during the 1970's and early 1980's.Two songs Olivia Newton John covered from this CD include A THOUSAND CONVERSATIONS, SILVERY RAIN and PLEASE MR. PLEASE."
5,OEM motor supplier- great motor- works perfectly.,I couldn't get a Kitchen Aid dishwasher replacement dryer motor- too old for parts from Kitchen Aid. I researched the old motor specifications verses the new motors and choose this unit. My dishwasher drying fan is working again!
2,not what they promised,I bought this book thinking that it would show me tabbed songs by all of the bands on the cover. Instead it shows a couple of trademark riffs by each band. The rest talks about the band and it's history. Interesting book but not what it is marketed as.
4,Nostalgic read,"The book on Bronko Nagurski is not just a biography of the playing career (not the life) of Bronko, it is a look at the times that he played in and the memorable people in football at the time.It is a book best read with rose-tinted glasses on as the writing is a touch worshipful of Bronko and maybe a bit exaggerated but be that as it may, it is a fun read.If you are looking for a book on Bronko only, don't get this book as we only get very brief glimpses into Bronko outside of the playing field unfortunately. Would have loved to read about what he did after he retired."
3,Way overpriced,"These wear out or break too easily. They are way overpriced for a couple of pieces of plastic. However, I like the cleats for riding, and most of my rides are in the 25 to 80 mile range. If you are willing to pay the price for them, I would recommend using them."
3,Easy to replace but Not Durable,"One of the things I really like about Amazon is how easy it is to look up past orders. So, I did just that with my orders for the Shimano Road Pedal Cleats. I'm reordering these cleats every 3 months or so because a key part of the cleat wears down. In specific, the yellow side tab wears down, and the result is that the shoes do not securely stay in the pedal.I ride almost every day, so I don't mind spending money on bike supplies, but, I'm wondering, could Shimano could use a different compound which would make the pedal more durable?I'm not going to buy new pedals (I use theShimano Dura Ace PD-7900 Road Pedals (Carbon)) just because I have to buy a new part 3 or 4 times a year. But, I can't give the Shimano Cleat 4 or 5 stars."
2,Cleats are vulnerable to fast wear and tear.,"I had these cleats for about 4 months. Now they need to be replaced.I am really disappointed at the quality of the engineering design because the ultegra cleats do quickly wear down compared to SPDs or even Look series pedals. The color contact portions grind off rather fast. The clip in gets duller and duller as the color contact points wear down. The issue is also the fact the plastics are not cast out of the same material, there is a delamination of the two plastic layers, further complicating the durability of the cleat.My SPD cleats lasted 10 years without an issue. As matter of fact, they still work. When I switched to Ultegras, they worn down so badly, I have to buy a new pair just 4 months in."
4,Simple mathematics give you a winner,"Although i have this game already for over 5 years, i still enjoy playing it. Sound, graphics and gameplay are great, considering the age of the game. The only sad thing perhaps is that you can perfectly calculate what to do in order to win the game: 1 cow feeds 10 people, next season i will have exactly produced 124 bows etc... The only random factors, which you can't influence at all, are events like the plague. If calculated well, you can defend one county against an invasion of all other counties together. So don't set the difficulty too easy. For the rest it is a recommender although its age."
3,Devotion,"This was a wonderful book until the end, it was almost as if the author was tired of writing and wanted it over with. It left me wanting more and I am not able to find another book dealing with Maria, and Trey and I would love to know how they ended up. This storyline held my attention captive until the very end, I highly recommend to anyone who loves historical romance to read it."
2,Incomplete ending,"The ending is so frustrating, don't bother to read the book! At the end, the hero and heroine are NOT together. I wondered if they forgot the final pages. This definitely needed an Epilogue"
4,I ask you...what was the author THINKING!!???,"""Devotion"" is exactly the type of romance that I love...a strong, innocent girl turns a tortured mans life upside down and they both fall madly in love...This had a five star rating written all over until the very last page...I have read hundreds of books, but NEVER, and I do mean NEVER, have I read a romance where the h/h dont resolve things one way or another by books end. A reunion was implied, but I am a ROMANCE reader..I dont want my ""Happily Ever Afters"" implied..I want to SEE them! I felt like the author just got sick of writng and said to herself..""Eh...thats good enough.."" UGH. Anyways, this is my first book by this author...I really enjoyed the story and Im going to give her another try...hopefully next time she will follow through."
5,First Brew turned out GREAT!!!,"This is so great. using the e-book along with the video made it very easy to understand and fast to move through. best part, my first brew turned out delicious.The video gave me a good understanding of the process and walked me through step by step. Other videos I saw were confusing & boring. Thank you to the homebrew shop owner who recommended this video. I definitely recommend it to everyone."
2,Annoying staging par excellence,"This is a wonderful opera. Too bad the DVD release had to be of this hideous production. All the actors are miscast, and the direction is simply astonishingly ghastly. I will continue to listen to the superb recording, without visuals. Also included in the package is a portrait of the composer, much more worthwhile. It is too bad about opera directors...."
2,Don't bother,"If you loved Diablo like I did then you will probably be disappointed at the lack of invention that typifies this add-on. The ""new"" levels are quite unimpressive and the ""new"" spells don't do much for me (with the single exception of the search spell). The new character (the Monk) is nothing more than a composite of the three previous character types. Don't waste your money - save up for Diablo 2."
1,Nice addition if Sierra would offer better support.,"Before Diablo II came out I played Diablo quite often. I thought HellFire would be a great addition, but after installing it the game would crash or lock up my system. I tried installing HellFire on a different computer with the same results, and Sierra's patch was no help. I'm not suprized since I've had similar problems with Caesar III and Pharaoh.Sierra has great ideas, but falls short on support after the sale is made."
4,Me Too,"The other readers have called as it is, the good and the not so good. I will be looking for the perfect camera bag, and tool box on the day that I die, for now this is as good as it gets."
5,Replacement DVD,"Keith Urban is one of my favorite recording artists and I've worn out 2 DVDs. This was a replacement (AGAIN) and if need be, I'll buy another one if I wear this one out."
5,A New Day has Arrived,"The Brilliant Doctor has done it! No single philosopher, scientist or mathematician could have pulled together all the pieces that this book does. Consciousness as a frame of reference equivalent to what Einstein described for the space-time continuum. This new view will change the way I think about alot of things including where we are going in human evolution. I want more! Thank you!!"
2,Not up to par...,I have all of Eric Hansens music and love it but this one is not up to par and actually quite boring.
1,Not worth your money!,I should have known there is something fishy about this CD when I noticed the Amazon folks didn't even bother to write a description of the product. I thought this would be the soundtrack from the movie Accross the Universe. THIS IS AN INSTRUMENTAL version of the Beatles songs and not a particularly good one.The price is outrageous for what you are getting: subway performance!I shouldn't blame the musician - I would sell my product and make the money any way I could. To blame are the Amazon folks. They should either write a short review or at least add the preview for people to hear.
4,Great read,It is a great read. Tells about the mob activities and the mob downfall. Found the audio book very interesting.
3,I know this man,"Over the past 10 years, i have referred hundred of patients to ""Elliot"". He is an excellent cardiac surgeon and 5 years ago performed a five vessel bypass on me. And I am not even Italian. On a holiday no less 3 months after 911.Had I had my coronary arteries ""cauterized "" mentioned twice on page 230, I would not be in good shape. Catheterized is what is meant. Also, Simon Dack at Mt Sinai was not a surgeon. He was a cardiologist and actually the founder of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology""Reading the book is a bit like looking into a bowl of spaghetti in which each strand has a name. A tangleled web of Italian names intermingled and many slurped away eventually by the fork and spoon of Rudy. Would have liked more on Il Dottore and less on Mafia. I am surprised the book is not yet a movie."
3,Mixed Reviews,"Hmmm, don't know which way to go, based on the previous reviews, I agree with all of them. I don't think it's the best book, but I think it's the best book she has written in a few years. Has kept me interested, wanting to read more; but at the same time it's kind of corny. Her best novels are still her first dozen or so.....I guess I am glad I didn't buy it, just borrowed from the library."
2,"She's a Writer? Well, she needs an Editor!","This is my first Danielle Steel book. I picked it up in an attempt to learn something about the Romance genre. One thing I found out is that Danielle Steele needs to learn something about grammer and punctuation. I have never seen so many comma splices in my life. This writing would fail a freshman English class. Don't they have editors at Delacorte Press, a Division of Random House?This book also has no structure, and runs on as if churned out. I never quite know who is talking about what from one sentence to the next. Still, I have to admit, the story is sort of compelling, in a shallow and pointless way that somehow perfectly describes the characters and their situations. I am not finished yet, but I do want to know how it comes out.I gave it two stars. One for being written at all, and one for me still reading it.Maybe there is hope for me as a writer yet. This book just shows that my standards have been set too high!"
2,So juvenile!,"Couldn't stand the character of Cooper Winslow, but more irritating is Ms. Steel's constant repetion of the same adjectives about each character. It's like she's telling us something new about a character that she has already repeated 10 times before on previous pages. Her books are usually predictable and I haven't read the last 2 or 3, but happened to get this one at the library for a ""free"" read. Die-hard fans of Steel will be happy with it, but if this is someone's first time with one of her books, please don't pick this one....try one of the first 9 or 10."
3,Better than most of her later stuff,"I have read virtually every Danielle Steel book out there. In fact, for many years, the minute I saw the book on the shelf, I was a bit lighter in my pocket for having bought it. I've been really disappointed in much of her later works - feeling that they were extremely repetitive and worn out plots. The Cottage is the best of the latter works I have read. I enjoyed the characters, though I would have liked to see more of the interaction between Alex and Jimmy, as well as Mark and Taryn. Overall, a light, enjoyable read."
1,Disappointment,"Steele always has easy reading type books that I have usually enjoyed. However, I do tire of all the ""perfect"" people who are in them. I too, was shocked that the neonatal doctor thought nothing of abortion, and the potential father not even being in the picture. I also found it ludicrous that this older man (70) was still in such great shape, with unbelievable sexual stamina, and was so ""hot"" looking-legs that went on forever.It was just too much this time. I may never read another Steel book again."
1,Grammer Police are Incensed,"While the previous reviewers have summed up the storyline and content pretty accurately, I was most annoyed by the outrageously bad writing. It was a struggle to simply understand what she was trying to say....dangling participles, incomplete sentences, misplaced pronouns, and just plain bad grammer. At times I had to literally parse a sentence to understand what she was trying to say about whom. I wouldn't mind doing this for a rewarding, or even mildly entertaining story, but for this? I don't think so."
5,Big John's Speedway Grill,"Good recipes that are easy to follow, interesting stories, very informative for new tailgaters. You don't have to be a race fan to enjoy this book."
4,"Cute book, but 'way overpriced","Some of the ideas are really nice in this and the other books in the series (though I hate charts except for colorwork), but even with the Amazon Discount all of them are overpriced. Yes, it's nice that it's a hardback, but let's face it--these are very small books. $9 would have been about right for what you get.Also, for the most part, these books all use very pricey yarn, which helps in making them look unique, but if you look closely, you might already have some designs similar to these at home already.Just because it says ""Vogue"" doesn't make it worth the extra money, at least not to me."
2,Can't do 1 cup without spitting water,"We have used the same Panasonic basic rice cooker since we bought it for $17.99 in 1983. We needed another one for times when we need to do multiple batches. We prepare sushi once per week and sometimes have guests. We bought this '10 cup' unit, another basic rice cooker. This rice cooker cannot cook 1 cup of dry rice and 2 cups of water without spitting substantial amounts of boiling water all over the counter and backsplash. Our old rice cooker let off steam but never spit volumes of water."
1,Rather go for a better one,"I purchased this product few months ago and I just hate the product now. Here are my findings:1) It didnt come with a steam basket and the spoons. I got rid of the old spoons and ended up going to the store to buy one.2) Each time I used the rice cooker, I had problems cleaning it as rice in the bottom is sticky.3) As a bonus, sometimes the rice gets burned out to the bottom of the vessel.4) Cleaning this has always been like a pain in the neck.5) The bottom of the vessel is like a thin cardboard and so delicate.6) Gets easily scratched.I feel, its not worth buying this product. I would just go to any walmart or target and purchase something with 10$ so I can use for 10- 12 months and get rid of that when its spoiled."
5,Rice Cooker,"I chose this steamer, because it does not have a non-stick coating. I have used it several times, and it works great. It helps to use a little olive oil and to soak it as soon as it is empty. My only complaint is that is does not use real measures. A small plastic cup comes with the cooker. It's much smaller than one measuring cup. So when it says it makes 11 cups, it is probably more like 8 or 9 cups."
1,NOT GENUINE AUDIOVOX BRAND!!!!,"Item is advertised as ""Audiovox CDM-8910 Flasher V7 Home/Travel Charger,"" which sure makes it sound like this is a genuine, Audiovox-brand product. IT IS NOT!!! Item is a cheap Chinese knockoff. A COMPLETE RIP-OFF!!!!"
2,Only for die-hard Burl Ives fans...,"These are not anywhere near the best recordings of his songs. The one album is live recordings that are, for the most part, not well done. Die hard Ives fans may be happy with their purchase but most others won't be."
3,Decent rice cooker with limitations,"Since rice being staple food for South Indians, we used this every day ever since we bought this a month ago. We enjoyed similar advantages that other reviewers mentioned. It works well if used for a max of 3.5 cups and use less water than generally used for cooking. There is some gap between the lid and the walls of the cooking vessel and so if used for beyond 3.5 cups, the water flows out of the cooker and creates a mess. Manufacturer should have provided a good rubber gasket to overcome this issue. This is definitely a disadvantage if you would like to fully utilize this for 5 cups."
1,"Messy, makes crusty rice and doesn't cook brown rice.","Boils over something fierce when cooking brown rice (even the Japanese ""light brown"" rice which cooks faster) and doesn't cook it properly (needs to cook it longer). Also boils with the sticky Japanese / Chinese rice. Annoying. Makes a heck of a mess. A pat of butter helps a lot with the boiling over (when you remember it) but there are still other flaws.Mess aside it does a decent job with traditional ""Sticky"" rice thought the bottom rice tends to ""brown"" or crust slightly which is not good.Our small (3 cup) cooker was too small and the only reason we bought this was the price and the brand (It's Panasonic, they must be OK for cooking rice) NOT SO.I recommend the traditional ""Chinese"" style rice steamers (e.g. Tatung with water added between the rice pan and the cooker) or the more expensive ""Japanese"" style cookers with the ""moisture cap"" which prevents boiling over. This is the worst of both worlds.We're going to buy something better."
2,I purchased and sent these back because they did not look new,i purchased 2 of these speakers form amazon.comand at the time they only had 2 of them lefti reviced them and they looked like they where not new they had come to me in a box that had hardly any packing in it so they where loose and falling around in the boxthey also looked scuffed and like someone had tried to peel back the part number label on them after i bought them they had none lefti then returned them and all of a sudden they have 2 in stock lolthese are the same ones i returned be ware before youbuyamazon shame on you for not putting these in the garbage and trying to pawn them off on someone els
1,Total letdown from Rayman 2 and 3,"I would second the review of BrainKid. Rayman 2 and 3 were great games for my 5 year old and myself. This game is nothing but frustration. It is clunky, buggy and just not interesting in any way."
3,Dream on,The music seemed a lttle lost in the space of S. Pauls Cathedral. I cannot get a satisfactory Dolby rendition which is surprising given the recent recording. Andrew Davis is not a visual Sargent or von Karajan or even Abbado. Philip Langridge could double as CPA. Disappointed with this
1,The Dream of Gerontius,The CD was damaged when I received it although it was guaranteed to play.It was returned for credit.Although I was offered another copy I decided not to take the chance that one would be damaged as well.
3,Deeper Please,"From the first words of Rogue Warrior, I was hooked. And while I am a very big Marcinko fan, The Real Team lacks depth. Each interview is so vague that you are left wanting more. I am salavating for Denny Chalker to go more indepth about this over-the-beach mission into Haiti. And in some places, I must admit that it sounds like a big kiss @$$ to Dick. When the add for this book came out, I was so excited because I thought we were going to find out much more about Steve Hartman, Doc Tremblay, and Chalker, but where was Chris Caracci in all this?"
3,Needed more ' real life' stories in The Real Team,"I've read 5 of Marchinkos books over the last 18 months and he writes great stuff. The stories are well described and each reads like an spec. ops. mission that was only recently de-classified.The guys he works with all have unique personalities and backgrounds but plenty of motivation. I bought this book to learn a bit more about who joins the team...and (more importantly) to hear them describe their best/worst missions. Each guy must have a mission that they look back upon?? Beyond just their upbringing, I was hoping to read more of their 'lives on the edge'. I got only a little of that.If you have friend or family looking at the military, this is certainly the book for them."
3,"interesting background material, NOT a Rogue warrior novel","I never got around to finishing it so I'll just have to say read the excerpts and be aware that this is not a novel, this is Marcinko and the real people he served with."
4,"Sharp simulation, with decent Internet play","I played this on-line with several pals (cable modem hosting) and had a total blast! This is a very smooth, sharp-looking simulation--key word, SIMULATION. If you're expecting a heavy-metal soundtrack and tons of glitzy eye candy, go elsewhere. But if you're looking for a sometimes-white-knuckling race with a significant but not extreme amount of car tweaking available, get Viper Racing.My only gripe: there's no track editor. MGI used a very advanced CAD/CAM system to develop the scenery, so we're stuck with the tracks included in the package. If only I could install the Chicago maps from Midtown Madness into this graphics engine..."
2,"Good for its day, but not anymore","I'm sure this racing sim had a pretty good audience back when it was introduced, but the years have not been as kind to it as it has to other racing sims, such as NASCAR Legends which still has a good audience. ""Viper Racing"" has nothing but fictitious tracks that look more or less like futuristic arenas from an arcade game, which wouldn't be so bad if there were more tracks to choose from. On the upside, you get to customize your car. On the downside, all of the cars are the same unless you adjust the suspension and such. You're better off with one of the ""Need For Speed"" games or a copy of ""NASCAR Legends"". If Sierra Sports had used the real GT racing season as a model for this racing sim, it would've been more enjoyable."
2,Short entertainment. Not worth the money,"This game is all packaging. The box itself is 3/4 full of air provided by a cardboard standoff inside. The clues are funny, but are severly limiting. This is definitely a game you can only play once maybe twice, because by that point, you'll have gone through and heard all the clue answers. And what's the point of playing a trivia game where you know all the answers? I'd say there's about $5 worth of clues in the game."
4,funny,"dirty minds (and its sequel ""more dirty minds"") is a pretty funny game. the clues are outrageous and made me laugh. but as a game on its own merits it kind of lacked. i found that either the clues were to easy and the word that was being guessed became obvious, or the word was one that i had never used before and so it was too hard. i actually had more fun just reading the clues aloud with friends and having them guess, just for entertainment value, than actually play the game itself in a competitive manner. still it was really fun so 4 stars."
1,Dont waste your money,"i bought this game for my christmas party which was all couples in there 20s and 30s thinking it would be really fun as a ""dirty"" but not really dirty adult game well it was a good idea of a game but did not meet my expectations there are very few questions so you can only play once if its the same people and the only question that i even thought was funny was the sample question from the game i found on the internet trust me with a little fun thought you could make your own questions and just make a version of the game at home!"
3,A book to read for the sake of the series rather then its self.,"This book wasn't as well written and edited as the first two, there were quite a few places where words were missing and although lots of things happened the style wasn't as personal. It didn't really finish things off just add another adventure and more characters without seeming to settle things much. A book to read for the sake of the series rather then its self."
5,Wonderful Album,"""All For Love"" is a wonderful album by the great New Edition. My favorite upbeat songs are ""Count Me Out"" and ""A Little Bit of Love (Is All It Takes)"" and my favorite slow\uptempo ballads are ""With You All the Way,"" ""Whispers in Bed,"" and ""Tonight's Your Night.""""School"" is a cute little rap song. The other songs: ""Sweet Thing,"" ""Let's Be Friends,"" ""Kickback,"" ""Who Do You Trust,"" and the title song are okay, but mostly just filler. Overall, the album's wonderful and if you're a fan of New Edition, you'll definitely want this album in your New Edition collection."
3,peanuts only!,"according to the description, those cans should have ""unique mix of nuts, pretzels, roasted corn, sesame stix and more"", but the ones i got were all peanuts only."
1,Horrible value,"at two bucks a can this was a rip off and I can't return them, the day before I received these in the mail I was at the 99 cent store and saw this item selling for a buck a piece. This rip off makes me feel like a chumps chimp :(("
2,outdated workout,"The 2012 update is misleading. This is not a new series of DVDs as claimed. You are getting a 2006 workout, not an updated 2012 workout. If I had an opportunity to view this DVD, I would not have bought this. The moves are outdated too and slow and repetitive and typical of the older workout. Definitely would not recommend this one"
3,Skip the first four songs!,In my opinion if you skip the first four songs you have a great Jefferson Starship EP!
2,Jefferson Starship Has An Identity Crisis,"This last album of the group with the name Jefferson Starship is a poorly organized, and badly written album of songs that sound as though they were quickly written just for the sake of getting an album out.On the one hand, you have Paul Kanter writing strange songs that are not power pop ballads, most notably about Rose, a character that appears in other songs Kanter has written for other JS albums. And then, you also have songs that sound like they are put together by a team of songwriters for Mickey Thomas to sing just for the sake of FM airplay. This album is not really representative of the group as a whole, and fails to produce a collection of songs that belong together on an album. Unless you already own it, don't buy it."
1,very bad quality,I did not like it one bit . I tried making rice using the water ratio differently each time and it still did not give the proper texture. Either it was too dry or too mushy. I own a panasonic rice cooker which works perfectly just that the container has lost its nonstick coating. Wass hoping ot replace it but i guess I'll have to look elsewhere this didnot work for me
5,Excellent so far...,"I am very pleased with this purchase. First of all, the non stick surface is safe, healthy, and works excellently! When I cooked my first batch of rice with this cooker I was surprised that the manual calls for a 1 to 1 ratio of water to rice. With my previous experience I thought that this was absurd and that the rice would not be cooked thouroughly. I followed the instructions and the rice was cooked to perfection! I have not used the cooker for anything else besides rice, but so far I am very pleased! It is not only much safer to the health (i.e. no aluminum in contact with the food) but the clean up is much much easier!!!"
1,Sorry school book,"This book is meant for a Tech Writing Graduate Level class, but is poorly compiled. Good information, but delivered in a ball of mess. No structure to the book"
1,Buy a different book,"I had to use this book as the text for a graduate class in Information Design. It is poorly edited, and several chapters are poorly organized and/or translated."
4,Great project book,"I was interested in slightly larger structures than what is presented in the book, but I will definitely keep it for future building projects."
5,Touch and Feel:Fire Engine,I bought this book for my grandson. He really enjoys it. His great grandfather loved fire engines. He loves to touch the pagesand feel the fabric.
3,Okay,So my 15 month old loves touch and feel books. This Has realistic pictures and I would have rated it higher if it was a little longer. Only about five pages. Just not slot of bang for the buck.
3,Johnny U's thowing action off kilter,The depiction of Johnny Unitas is fine but where the ball is in relation to his classic over-the-top throwing motion seems way off. It's like the ball has slipped from his grip and is going off 45 degrees from where he is looking.
4,high quality,"This was my first time buying such a tool for my new dog. The quality was excellent. However, I cannot use it because it doesn't have longer tines, I don't want to give our dog an almost bald cut but this was my lack of understanding how this tool works."
1,still can't play!,We've had this game for about two weeks and we are still not able to play. About 15 different error messages pop up on the screen! I've done everything possible to fix the problem and now new errors are popping up! My husband seems to think that we need a new graphics card. But I know that I am not wasting any more money on this game. I haven't heard anything good about since we've owned it. As far as I can tell the game isn't worth the money or the headache.
1,Terrible,I agree with the previous reviewer that says the service is terrible. This game takes a top line computer or else it runs slow. Missions are the same over and over again. There is no customer service. My personal experience with this game was BAD BAD BAD...Wait for everquest 2 or world of warcraft NC soft = Bad games
2,No gameplay variety,"The main problem here is the gameplay. Combat, combat and more combat. And that's it.Really. There is absolultely nothing else in the gameplay. No matter how much you like superheros, you are going to get bored eventually."
3,OK for now.,"I played Ultima Online for 4 years, DAOC for 6 months, and this game for about a month now. As far as stability this game is quite good, interface is easy, combat is good.You can fight in the streets for experience in various towns. You can fight in indoor missions given to you by contacts. You can fight in task force missions which take about 4-6 hours to complete.Roleplaying is sort of limited, storyline is defined by the game rather than the players, there is no PVP, there is no property, and it IS a level grind.But that being said it's fun for now. I don't play as often as i did in UO, i tend to login, play for an hour or so, then logout.If the game doent get more content i will likely jump ship when the next game comes and perhaps check back for city of villains-- the evil expansion where you play villains."
4,Non Gamer here,"I simply don't play a lot of online games. I have tried many and they all fall short of fun. None have captivated me the way CoH has. I am not a kid anymore and dont spend ungodly amounts of time playing games. I have work and children at home, but I love this game and play it every chance I get. I have played other games online like Diablo and EQ, they don't hold a candle to City of Heroes!"
3,Graphics Card Warning,"The game is fun, as far as I have played it, but I want to give everyone a warning. When they say that you have to have a GeForce 2 or ATI Radeon 8500 better, they mean ONLY these chipset video cards! If you have integrated graphics with an Intel chipset, you will not be able to run this game!"
1,Dont buy this game,NCsoft is a rip off there tech support is a joke if you have problems the chances are slim to none of getting it fixed.after three weeks of e-mails and answering stupid questions like are my cap locks off? I never did get my problem fixed.
1,Probably great,"I'm sure this game is fantastic...that is if you can actually play. I've had it for 2 weeks and have not been able to play once due to various reasons that have not been determined by tech support yet. My suggestion is to visit the site and read the boards before you buy. Hopefully, you'll be able to determine if you will be one of the lucky few that can play the game with little or no issues. I will continue to try until my free month is up and then I'll move on or return to other games I play. Good luck if you choose to buy."
1,RIP OFF,"Bought this game as a Christmas gift for my son and he cannot even use it. This is an online only game and it was shut down this month! After researching I now know it was announced in August that the game would be ending, yet this company continued selling these games. Scandalous. I am NOT happy about this, I should get a refund."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this because my son was begging me for it. It was very cheap, but it is just the game City of Heroes that you have to be online to play. You could download it for free online. They are canceling this game at the end of November anyway, so it isn't worth your time."
2,Waste of money and time,"I have played this game and have a lvl 20 character. If i could,i would have never played this game. The only thing good about it is the fact that it character creation is unique. But other than that the missions are the same over and over. The customer service is messed up and there are to many forums. There website is also very bad and they will make you sign up for a million things before actually doing anything in the game... STAY AWAY FROM CITY OF HEROES... You'll thank me for it in the end..."
1,Be Careful,"Make sure your computer has the correct required video card. We have four brand new laptop, computers none of which had the correct video card. After purchasing the game we also found out that only the GE Force 2 series card works without any gliches. I cannot review the game itself but only say we were sorely disappointed that this game only accepts one graphic video card."
3,It's an okay game.. If you're 8.,"I found my self doing repitive tasks over and over, Once you hit level 14, all you do is bank-grind (Get a group, find a bank quest, kill all mobs in it, then exit, team leader will reset the quest and rinse & repeat)Not very fun at all, unless you don't know what fun is, it's not worth 15/mo."
1,What a travesty!,"To all people who have the gift of hearing, do yourself and your ears a huge favor. Do not subject them to having to hear this sad, sad selection. In fact, I make a motion to Amazon.com to remove this horrible product from their inventory. Immediately. Seriously. This takes a gifted musician's creations and butchers them. What a travesty!"
1,beware - this drive WILL crash,"Just do a google search on 'IBM deskstar drive failure', and you will see that the majority of these drives are winding up in the garbage heap with the same symptoms. In fact, there is a class action lawsuit currently pending against IBM. You are taking a huge risk if you use this product."
1,It was fine while it worked...,"I was very satisfied with this drive when I first installed it. It was quick and quiet. However, after only six months of operation, it died on me. I was able to retrieve most of my data in time, but the return process was a battle. I would not recommend this drive or any other by IBM due to their (now) well-known reliability problems."
1,WOW,I have NEVER in my life ordered something and it didn't get there.. I guess there is a first time for everything!
1,Poorly written!,I thought this book would be interesting. Was I wrong! Who wrote it - an infatuated 15 year old?Don't waste your money or your time. There is no depth to any of the characters and the storyline jumps around enough to make you dizzy.Horrible.
2,A let down,"Although I had high expectations and, as a firefighter, expected to find the subject interesting, this book was a bit disappointing.The biggest problem is that the author does not really understand what motivates our profession. Unlike the characters in her book, most of my most decorated colleagues are ordinary, well-grounded family men and women, who don't see our job as some sort of penance."
1,No stars deserved!,"Off-key, grating, and unoriginal, this is a horrible example of the genre. Apparently some people think that all you have to do is have good intent and their music will be worth listening to, but this is definitely not. Everyone I know refers to this band as ""Moonsuck"" because of their uninspired caterwauling."
1,Obsolete.,"This was one of the very firstbooks about HTML (it was published back in 1994), andsignificant portions of it are unfortunately now obsoleteand incorrect."
3,Trophy Bass 3D,I fish quite a bit and was excited to try this game. Like most Sierra products it comes with good setup and gameplay intructions and is easy to install and start. The graphics are average compared to many other more action oriented games but the fish movement and lure movement is pretty good. The game has multiple levels of difficulty and a wide variety of different lakes to fish on. Overall it is quite fun to play. The online gaming option is pretty boring but might be fun if you were playing with a friend. I had problems with the game not saving my progress under tournement mode and still haven't gotten this part to work right...
1,Disappointed,"Despite the excellent music, I found this movie extremely disappointing. I have admired both Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah for some time, and looked forward to seeing them mix their moxies. But the shallowness of characters the wrongness of the behaviors just left me embarrassed for everyone involved. The bad boy becomes the hero only because he can choreograph good music, not because he's had a change of heart. We're supposed to just forget about the fact that he stalked and kidnapped the heroine. The ruthlessness of the competition for music designed to praise God is disturbing. And the sexual double entendres in the gospel songs was downright embarrassing. I left this movie depressed at the thought that Americans may have forgotten how to preserve the sacred in anything."
2,"Love Queen Latifah, but didn't like this","Love Queen Latifah, but didn't like this. I wish they would have just made this a singing movie. By making it a church choir movie and then bringing in all the drama, one nights stands, etc, it was difficult to watch. It made it seem like this church choir was just a huge soap opera and I thought it was a disservice to how most choirs actually operate."
3,Entertaining overall.,A good story line but a bit fluffy. Parton and Latiffa are quite good but I was expecting more in the way of gospel music than I got.
4,Really Enjoyable,"I watched so many previous for Joyful Noise and as a gospel singer myself, I thought that this would be an appropriate movie and I was not disappointed. The singing in this film is excellent and innovative, especially the competition scenes. The story line lacks a little bit (which is why I gave it four stars) because the romances are a bit contrived, as are some of the scenes between Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah. There are some really touching moments too, though and overall I have watched the movie a couple of times. You will probably find yourself singing along and maybe even downloading the soundtrack by the end of it. Overall, this was a worthy purchase."
5,joful noise,I like the movie calls it was very entertaining.I thought that Queen Latifah Dolly Parton keke polmer did a ex lent job of singing and they were also funny.the story line was very good and also entertaining.
2,Glee ripoff!,"I love Dolly Parton, and I think Qween Latifa has one of the best voices around, but this film, a studio stuge project, and a clear rip offf of Glee, basicaly sucks.There is no dynamec to the plot, all the minor charicters, and by that I meen not Dolly or Q latefa, are backed up by so second and third level talents that it's almost painful.Some Xtians will like it, but as entertainment for the masses, it falls short."
3,Musical cheese,"If I had to sum this movie up in one word, I'd say cheesy. There was enough cheese in this movie to make a family size nacho plate, it oozed it in almost every scene. The acting wasn't that great either, especially by the daughter who really needs to tone down her facial expressions, they were overdone throughout the movie. The music was nice, but it was obvious they weren't singing with it. I've always loved Dolly Parton's singing but I am saddened she chose to have so much facial plastic surgery to the point of being a distraction while watching the movie.But it was a decent movie if you just need a very unrealistic silly escape for a bit or if you enjoy Queen Latifah like we do."
3,Cute,"Cute movie, but not sure it was worth paying to see. It was more one of those movies you are happy to watch for free on TV. The singing though is amazing - some pretty great voices!!"
4,Great WW2 flight simulator,"Microsoft has given all other WW2 simulators a challenge. This game has great graphics and gameplay and at times good cinemas, but not the greatest. It's hard to play without a joystick and a good system, if your speed is not a Pentium 2 or higher it could be a little slow. It's still fun though. The missions are fun and fast paced, although it takes a while to get used to and be able to handle the plane. Also in battle it's sometimes hard to get the other planes, but the bombers you'll probably get on your first try but it still takes a while to get the others. There are a number of different aircrafts, but only a couple available in each mission. It is a challenging and fun game, I reccomend it to people who like air combat and flight games."
3,Very good game,"Hi, Im a 12 year old flight sim freak:) A very good game, although the graphics could be better...(its good for an 1998 game though). The flight engine is also very good, and you can set the realsim to however much you want. One warning though, it only supports one controller. This means that if you don't have a CH Products or Thrustmaster HOTAS(Hands On Throttle And Stick), you can only have one joystick(unless your someknid of a electronics/software genius and tweak with the whole program). However, if you want an even better game, I would recommend Combat Flight Simulator 2."
3,"Weak, buy MS CFS2: Pacific Theatre.","Microsoft made massive improvements when they made the sequel to this game. I have them both and don't really recommend this game.However, I'm a Pacific Theatre buff and prefer the carrier-based aircraft, like the F4U Corsair. If you like the P-51 Mustang or the Spitfire and want to fight German planes... buy this game."
1,"Great Fun, Little Realism.","Although the Dog-Fights are really fun, it tends to get a little boring when you've beaten the game 10 times on maximum difficulty. The single missions keep it alive, but have the same overall flaw. Quick combat tends to be the same way because there is no randomness. 1-9 planes will come at you and as soon as you kill all of those, 1-9 more will come at you again. Also, although the planes look like they have there own shape, they are really blocks to the computer, which means you may hit things which you really didn't. However for a game created in 1997 it's pretty good.P.S. it is really cool when you see a plane go down in a fire ball."
3,Needs improvement,If you have ever played any of the aces series you will find this a disappointment. Aces over Europe is about 10 times better and more realistic. This is just an expensive game that has Microsoft on it so it sells.
3,Like Meatloaf Every Tuesday Night...,"This is the game I bought a new CD-ROM, Voodoo 3D accelator card and almost a new $1,500 PC to play! It chokes on my old 133 MHz unless everything graphical is set to wire-frame-and-polygon scale.Initially very fun, until you play it a week or so. Then you realize that the things that make computer games really fun -- role playing where your squadron gains more experience -- is missing from this flight sim. Sure, the dog fights are fun, but this game tends to give you that ghostly 'I'm all alone in Sim Land' feel after while. The campaigns are long strings of same-o missions. A case in point: After you take off, you can skip to the action. Pretty soon you find you never fly anymore, just skip to the action, fight, and skip back home. That gets old fast and pretty soon you'll delete this ol' dog off your hard drive and look for something with more depth."
2,Evaluate your need.,"I bought Western Digital WDG1NC5000N from Circuit City but returned it the very next day. These are the reasons...1. This product will work ONLY through a router. I confirmed this with WD customer support also. Router should allocate IP then only your computer will recognize this hard drive. This means that typically you cannot carry this to your office and take backup from there.2. Very very slow data transfer. I started copying 18GB before going to sleep, by next day morning (after approx 7 hrs) it copied only 7GB.Even their customer support person told me that this drive will be very slow since it is connected through router and not directly with your computer. I must admit, greated use of this drive is that you can access your data through network.Overall, this drive will be very useful for people who want to access data through network (monthly fee may apply) but i dont suggest this for a normal home-office user. Now you decide.."
1,Dont buy this product - software stinks - you can do better,"I bought this drive not knowing how crappy Mionet would be or that it was even used. I tried to use this without Mionet, there are many internet entries about doing this. I could not get them to work so out of desperation I finally took it apart pulled out the drive, attached it directly to a sata port in my pc and reformatted it. So much for using this across my home network. I only gave one star - would like to have given this product minus stars."
1,Severely Flawed,"I recently purchased one of these things, and sent it back the next day. As others have mentioned, there is a lot of bait and switch in the software offering. Full MIONET functionality requires what is now a $79/year subscription, and the backup software is a trial version. That aside, my experience was as follows:The drive would only stay visible on my network for about four hours, then it disappeared to both my PC and my laptop. The power button didn't work at all. I had to unplug the thing to get it to reboot. After restart, it would be visible for about another four hours, then it disappeared again.I've used Western Digital products for more than 20 years, and this was my only dissapointment. It's on its way back to the dealer."
1,"Slow, hot, dead, unfixable","This device is slow, runs hot, and no way to fix it when it breaks down. On top of that, my hard drive failed after about a year of occasional use.Occasionally it would lock up and I'd have to restart it. Since it ran hot, I tried to remember to shut it off when I wasn't using it, but I would often forget.I'm a computer nerd, so I usually just repair, reformat and retask things when they break, but the parts and software on the MBWE are cheap and proprietary. I did the research when it died and decided it just wasn't worth fixing.I've been much happier with Lacie drives, although I wouldn't recommend their ethernet drives either. I've switched to a usb drive until the ethernet storage improves. Read the reviews, there are a lot of poorly designed drives on the market right now."
5,no problem whatsoever,The battery performs and recharges just right and for a real price difference.
3,just the short story,Years ago this was released as (Bicentennial man & other short stories) and this is not a full novel of the life of Andrew Martin. There is another book out there called (The Positronic Man) which Isaac Asimov co wrote with Siilverber that was a full novel version of this short story. though I think this is a wonder book of short stories by Asimov I just hope must understand it is not a full novel version of that story.
3,what's up with this?!,"This strange item is listed in the occult fiction stuff, but it doesn't even pretend to be fiction in fact. Instead it is the opinion and rambling of some unnamed occultist, who has decided to commit his every idea to writing. I found the material mildly amusing, with some good advice, some bad, and a number of plain errors of fact. The author seems to enjoy categorizing those he disapproves of as [people] and silly people, and while he may have some actual exerience in occult practice, he also seems strangely gullible about things like conspiracies. Probably nearly half the text is filled with quotes from other authors, including, oddly enough, the material from the Church of the Subgenius, which the author seems to take seriously!If you've already read widely in the occult, and you'd like a laugh, this book might be for you."
3,"Not too action-packed, but exciting plot","I liked this book because it was exciting. There was a twisted plot that involved treachery, and a mad man general. I didn't like it because sometimes the plot was a little predictable and overall it wasn't too action-packed."
4,Great Wordless Picture Book,This book is a good book to use to encourage children to make up their own story using the illustrations. The book has very simple illustrations that will not confuse the child. This book is fun for children because the characters are mice that go on a picnic. Another good wordless picture book is First Snow written by the same author. It also has some great illustrations that are easy for children to understand to create their own story.
1,looks bad,"I should know from the price. too light, too small and looking like child jewelry. Tried with a chain but too light to look nice on your neck."
5,All things Drawing,This book is a fantastic compilation of fine art drawing and painting at its best. highly recommended
1,poor quality images,"I am disappointed with the quality of the images. They are the quality of an ink jet printer set at draft quality. Most of the images are so faded it is difficult to see at all. I have returned this book, which is something I do once every 1000 books I order, and it is the first art book I have ever returned in my life."
1,dull,"Who knew Vivaldi could be this unimaginative? Oh nevermind, the concertos on this recording were missing all their parts except for the main violin lines and therefore had to be largely reconstructed. This immense task was done by this recording's violinist or conductor (I forget by whom because I gave away this CD months ago). Unfortunately the reconstructions are depressingly dull and sound as if written by a musicologist rather than a composer. Yes Vivaldi wrote so much that some of his pieces might sound too similar; but one thing that Vivaldi's music exudes is vitality ... vitality that is sorely missing from these reconstructions."
2,"Read the first, Bill the Galactic Hero; skip this one","I read the first one about 6 months ago. A all-round good time, one mishap after another, the first book you wanted to see want would happen next, BUT this one! Jumps from one story line to another, with unbelievable plots, I know that it is Science Fiction but the authors could at lest try to make it believable. I felt it was three or even four books that were not related to each other, I would not recommend this one at all. I will try one more of the series, but if the next one is just as bad no more."
3,Several Good ideas,"This book has several good ideas, although some seem a little excessive. For instance, his ideas on packing light. Overall, I found it very useful."
1,Give Me a Break,"This movie is the biggest load of BS I've seen in years. The script is incredibly weak and tremendous young actors are wasted. I beleive Julia Roberts thinks that she's this woman but I just couldn't buy into her charater. Also, I just got sick of watching the longing looks of Roberts. It was bad acting.If you want to see a movie that tackles this exact same subject in an intelligent fashion I recommend ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" with Maggie Smith. Ms. Smith won an Academy Award for her performance."
3,Enjoybale but not a great film,I enjoyed this film but it wasent a great film to see over and over again. The charactors are likeable and the story is somewhat interesting. The story drags on at times but it has a good story and is insperational at tiems. It's not Julia Roberts best film but it's still enjoyable.
4,great movie,"No matter what anyone else said about this movie I really enjoyed it. I completely identified with the characers. There are times when you just wanna laugh,cry, cheer,and completely slap Kirsten Dunst. I fully plan on buying this dvd it's worth buyig but if your still sceptical rent it."
5,Extraordinary and splendid,"I have seen so many, many movies but this one I think has to be my all time favorite. The whole setting of the liberal arts college, the 50s conservative setup in which the college dwells so firmly in, and the magical aura of a bygone era captivates you right form the start of the film. Top that with some beautiful photography, a nice gripping story and some convincing performances and you've got a great film.This is a movie that will lift you up and make you smile. Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) Encourages students to reject conformity in any form and pursue careers rather than settle down as housewives. Colleagues advise the new professor that the trick to surviving Wellesley is to go unnoticed, as too much independence frightens administrators, who she is told have claws under their gloves.With this movie, I think many people will discover that not only students learn from teachers, but everyone learns from others."
2,Not the real Wellesley!,"Cute movie, and it was fun to watch them filming on our campus in Fall 2002, but please *don't* accept this movie as any sort of realistic portrayal of Wellesley College! The best part of this movie is the beautiful shots of our campus (the Galestone Tower, the Chapel interior and exterior, etc).Inaccuracies aside (and it's a BIG aside), I thought that the movie was o.k. at best. The sub-plots with the individual students were much more interesting than the main professor-comes-to-liberate-Wellesley story. Keep an eye out for Ginnifer Goodwin, who is excellent. The costumes are accurate for the period, but not for everyday Wellesley wear.In the end, the movie could have been a lot better, but it probably could have been worse."
3,Does daddy approve of this?,"Personally, I didn't like this movie, don't know why my, sister wanted the DVD. Don't even know why she showed it to me and nevertheless, I'm not a big fan of Julia Roberts. This movie stinks. No other words. In my opinion it sucked. It might be good to someone else. I don't care. But am I not here to talk about the DVD? Yada yada its a great dvd. WHY? Cause I love special features. Ehh... Not really exciting special features though. yawn... Theres still one good reason to get this dvd. Its got kirsten dunst. The girl from spiderman. And any friend of spiderman is a friend of mine. (her acting sucked in this movie) (i'm not a geek or a comic book freak or a dungeons and dragons or chess player)"
3,"Better than I expected,","but I wasn't expecting much either. Roberts is okay - she's Julia Roberts and I gues that is really the most you can ask of her anymore. Thankfully the girls take center-stage here and ultimately keep us interested in another one of those teachers-as-heroes films. Dunst is quite the effective bitch here and she really does make you want to give her a smack. I really like Stiles, but she seems so contrived in this role. Gyllenhall and Godwin are great. Visually appealling and with a killer soundtrack (worth getting) it's not a bad way to kill a couple of hours."
4,Not too terrible,"I had a bad feeling about this movie when I saw Kirsten Dunst's name on the cast list. Since the Virgin Suicides, I don't think she's shot one movie that would be worth paying for. Then I noticed Julia Stiles was in this movie as well and then I really expected it to be bad.So I watched my friend's copy one night and I didn't get bored enough to turn it off in the middle. That's always a good sign. Julia Roberts did an awesome job as an unconventional teacher that comes to a girl's finishing school. The girls all have various problems that she helps them with, and inspires them to do better.But sometimes I wanted to gag when Dunst and Stiles overdid their ""hoity toity"" boston accents.""If this isn't about appreciating art, then what are we supposed to learn?"" tee-hee.Blech!!"
3,Definately a matinee,"Well you have to like the vulnerability that Julie Roberts brings to this film. She definately lights up the screen and always mananges to pull off a struggling character. Stiles roleis really well developed in light of the twist they put on her decision, and probably the best script writing in the film was in this scene. They didn't make the message trite which I appreciated.It was definately a jab at upper society forcing women into set roles which needs to be discussed as well. They dropped Julia's romance though in a way that just seemed a little too male bashing. Unfortunately most films that try to deal with the plight of women don't avoid male bashing and this one was no exception. It did a great job capturing the trouble a teacher faces in winning over an arrogant and jaded audience. Overall a nice warm fuzzy film, but not a life-changer."
4,Upperclass Life In An Earlier Time,"This is a time in the early 1950's when some women went to top women's colleges to learn how to be the ""perfect"" wife, mother and homemaker, rather than to pursue a career in law, business, finance and other male domains. Julia Roberts plays a brash new college teacher who instills in her students the motivation and thinking that they should be going after these advanced careers first and not just looking to get married to the right man."
1,NOT STAINLESS STEEL,"This is one of the most deceptively described products I have seen in a while. This rod is not stainless steel. It is stainless steel in color only. The listing says that it is stanless steel material, but it is not. This rod also is made by rolling and has a seam. Even the cheap rods at Home Depot do not have a seam. Do not buy this product."
1,KILLED MY IPOD,"You may be able to notice that it says it's a Li-Ion battery, but if you zoom in on the computer you can clearly see that it says Li-Pol. I believe this killed my Ipod because I know for a fact that the Ipod Video 30gb 5th generation requires a Lithium Ion Battery. Don't get this product without first taking heed to this post.Thank you viewers:)"
3,It was alright,"The battery is a good idea if you have an ipod that is starting to die. It saves you a lot of money, but the battery still isn't 100% like it use to be. The tools that come with it are not that helpful, but that's okay. The package came quick."
4,A great deal,Battery is kind of a pain to install but it is worth it. It lasts longer than the Apple original...
3,Did not work in the Ipod,I was hoping this great deal would take care of my problem. The battery connected up fine but the battery would not take a charge. Seller shipped super fast and I was not out but a couple bucks.
4,ahead grip tape,"Ahead grip tape, although costing a little more than Vater grip tape, seems to last longer, is more durable and still makes a decently 'loud-enough' rimclick sound when the butt end of the stick is played against the rim. Additionally, although each package only covers 1 pair of sticks, I think the product, for it's price, is well worth the cost. I definitely recommend it if you have slipping issues or you are dropping sticks. It also does not leave a sticky 'feel' on the hands while/after playing. Another good reason to use this product is to save your hands if you need to play extremely hard-loud, but don't want to get callouses and blisters. 4 out of 5 stars and 2 uncallouGrip Tapesed unblistered THUMBS UP for Ahead grip tape!"
2,Would not recommend to the depressed,"I would not recommend this book to anyone that is feeling depressed. I was overwhelmed by information which didn't necessarily give hope that recovery is achievable. Nor did it leave me feeling good about myself, just stressed that I wasn't doing ""it"" right and that I would end up depressed again.You would be much better off reading ""The Mindful Way Through Depression"" by Williams, Teasdale, Segal and Kabat-Zinn. It gives a clear, calm message of hope as well as practical concepts and tools. At the least read the preview on this book and see how it leaves you feeling versus this book."
3,It was okay,"Perhaps if this is the first book you pick up on the subject, you will find it helpful. I had been through many prior to reading this one and didn't learn anything new, nor did I feel it was necessary to keep on hand for future reference. I ended up donating it to my local library in the hopes someone else will benefit.As an earlier reviewer stated, you cannot underestimate the effectiveness of one-on-one therapy. This in conjunction with books a trusted therapist recommends would probably be most helpful. Much luck in your search for relief and happiness! :o)"
4,Wow,"Very insightful- alot of good information the parts that related to me the most were:-I found that I do not nor have I ever had depression. I am just likely to grieve when there are problems which is why I feel as I do from time to time- great in one part but leaves me not knowing how to help myself during the month or two long episodes every 18 months so (when whatever is occuring in my life accumulate to the point that I don't want to get up in the morning.) However, I suspect that my boyfriend has been slightly depressed since his parents divorce 10 years ago- I don't want to bring it up but after reading this book I think that he has this unresolved issue. I'll keep this in mind but won't pursue it with him unless an issue arises where I see it fit.-Great Marriage Section (there is also a Divorce one that I didn't read) -I found it very helpful to my relationship now- though I am not married and I am confident that it will help me down the line."
2,Inaccurate about drug treatment,"Has inaccurate information about medications. Says that lithium is a near miracle for bipolar disorder, when in fact it works for only 70% percent of people, for instance. (He even says this in another paragraph). Be forewarned. He says similar things about unipolar depression. It is a book about non-medical approaches to treatment, but I hope someone who knows little about drug treatment will take it accurate. It's not just information about meds that came on the market after the publication date, too. Please don't take it at face value."
1,Outdated,"Beware: this book was published in 1999. Much of the information is very outdated. Also, as a sufferer of depression, I found that a lot of things that the author claims from a psychotherapist's point of view are very inaccurate. Treatment has come a long way in the past 10 years, so I would consider checking out a more recently published book."
2,Read 'Feeling Good' Instead,"In reading O'Connor, I found striking similarities to the techniques found in 'Feeling Good'. O'Connor's work did little to help or inspire me. 'Feeling Good' is an upbeat, self-actualizing read. Skip this one and go directly there."
3,Nice dinnerware; completely fictional MSRP,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a nicer dinnerware set than this for the price. It's well designed, and beautfully finished--unlike a lot of off brands with their so-so glazing and bumpy surfaces. However, don't be fooled by Mikasa's fictional list price. For some reason, Mikasa and all the other china/stoneware/dinnerware makers feel they need to inflate their MSRPs to laughable heights. I can't imagine too many people are fooled by this tactic, but don't jump in too quickly without getting a comparison price. Remember that a high percentage discount from a fictional price is worthless if you still paid too much."
5,classic,any dr who with tom baker is a good dr who. always going to be my favorite dr and this is a great story!!
3,Louise,This is the first story for Louise Jammeson (Leela) In which The Doctor (Tom Baker) meets a schitziod computer of the doctor. some neat monstors but some preety hoaky ones too. Louise gets better with time. Many did not like her because she wore animal skins. She is the first companion since Sarah Jane Smith left the show. Hope you like the shows.
1,Poor taste,"This book comes so highly rated that I was surprised to find that it is written in such poor taste. Obviously, some mystery readers don't mind a story line that is laced with hard-core swearing and violence. But if you're not one of those readers, then be forewarned and don't bother with this one. I really enjoy a good bibliophile mystery, but in this case I couldn't force myself to go beyond the first few pages to discover the author's touted knowledge of antique books. With so many well written mystery stories to read, I don't need to spend time reading this type of writing. Again, mystery lover beware."
1,"Too much teaching, not enough writing","Dunning did his homework in the book department, name dropping ever author and how much their book was worth in 1983. But the story is chockful of cliches and mixed metaphores. This reads like a poor mix of every detective novel on the shelves. (I wonder how much a first edition Dunning goes for?) The writer's world of show me don't tell me does not hold Dunning back from telling us every detail of first edition books. I felt like I was in a literature class on how to open a store; not reading a mystery novel. Oh, yeah, that's in there, too; something about a murder or two."
3,Should interest anyone who cares about the bookworld,"Since I haven't read widely in this genre, I may not be qualified to assess this book as detective fiction. But the story kept me turning the pages and the insight into the world of rare book dealers was worth the price of the book. If you care anything about books as objects, this one is worth your time and money. I would have rated it higher except that it seemed cliche-ridden and the characters were somewhat stereotyped. But it was good enough entertainment that I plan to start the sequel immediately."
5,Please stay a group,I love the songs from cheetah girls they are so fun and orginal. Plus the vocal of these girls are great they should stay together as a group but this is a great pop cd for those who like pop its got it up beat fast tempo songs that wakes you want to sing along i highly recomed it.
5,Pretty Good,"It was pretty good but the sad thing is, the CD was WAY better than the actual boring movie, The only reason the CD is good is because of Raven's great voice."
5,The Best !!!!!!!!!!!,"This soundtrack tottally rocked! Here's what I thought of the songs.1.Cheetah Sisters-I love this song! Why? Just because.2.Cinderella-I really like this song, but I do know that they copied it from PLAY.3.Girl Power- This is my total Favorite!!! It rocked!!!!4.Together We Can-Love this!

5,CG inspiration for 4 friends.,"After seeing the movie and buying the soundtrack, my three friends and I have create our own group called Sassy Chicks. We can sing to the songs and have started to write our own songs. We performed at the Mall talent show. We got 4th place, but there were 10 places. This great soundtrack. I recommend that you buy it.

3,It works BUT . . .,"Ok so the program does reshape your body in six weeks, but Debbie is terribly irritating and boring. I literally have to put the workout on the mini dvd player and watch the regular tv just to get through it. The music is really awful and the beat doesn't match what you're doing and her count is way off, the exercises work but it's more of a lower body work out for the first couple of weeks. The later workouts work the upper and core more but still focus on the lower section a lot. It's really difficult to get into it if you haven't worked out for a while and you will be sore! Just keep pushing at it, you're body will get better just make sure to play better music to keep motivated."
2,Be ware of injuries,"i never finished the full six weeks of this program. I just wanted to post this review to let everyone know. if you go to beachbody's website and click on debbie seibers other ""Total Body Solutions"" workout and hit the button to watch the preview, she states in that video that the video was created when she went to a physical therapist for help because she sustained INJURIES WHILE FILMING SLIM IN 6."
3,Issues in other regions,Debbie Siebers works! The only problem is that I travel accross the world and it does not work in other regions and that is a bummer.
4,Great!,"I had been working out with The Firm for a year and reached a boring plateau. I decided to try slim in 6. I did the first workout called start it up and it was too easy for me, so I went into ramp it up. It has been effective because Debbie works the abs a lot. I got through burn it up, it was tough because it is over an hour. I'm going to buy her other workouts. I love them! I've had better results than. The Firm."
3,Misleading ad picture,"I love the Slim in Six series of videos. I had borrowed my sister's set, and wanted a set of my own. The ad seemed to offer multiple DVD sets like my sister had. I should have read it more closely or asked questions. It only included the first DVD in the series. Disappointed."
2,Not everything advertised in picture,Not everything advertised in picture. I paid too much money to just receive a video. Thumbs down! Where was the resistance rope?
1,disappointed,"The DVD I was most interested in in this set came scratched. Since I was working my up to it, return wasn't allowed because of time"
4,Womens Keds,I like these sneakers. The only problem I have with them is they are a little large for me. I ordered the size I normally wear and they were a little to big.
1,Wrong Size but MY fault,"I honestly think I just ordered the wrong size... but only because it was confusing when I placed the order. Also, VERY unhappy that I had to pay the return shipping charges. So check the sizing, but you might have to make an actual phone call to figure out the correct sizing."
5,Best technical book on photovoltaics,"This book stands out for its hands-on approach, and in-depth treatment of all PV related topics: From manufacturing and underlying physics to applications, with economic analyses. The associated theoretical ideas are dealt with in detail, you can't finish reading a topic and be dissatisfied with what you get out of it. You come away with basic understanding, as well as the ability to design and start working with anything you read about. Remarkable.In all, great book.. I've used it out of a library, but can't wait for a cheaper edition."
3,"an excellent reprint, with mediocre unpublished material","""The Vision and the Voice"" is Crowley's greatest literary achievement. The beauty, originality and numinosity of his visions rival the work of William Blake. These richly layered arcana are the vindication of his cabalistic interests, which elsewhere are often merely obscure and annoying. However, this has been published several times before, and the newly discovered comments do not add a great deal.The previously unpublished papers -- the Paris, Ab-ul-Diz, and Bartzabel Workings -- are indispensable for serious Crowley students, but they do not stand on their own. These records of indistinct and silly mediumistic transactions may not have been published before for the simple reason that they are too embarrassing to Crowley. He is at his obnoxious worst in dealing with his lovers, and his insistence that he is a ""skeptic"" while practicing wide-eyed gullibility is painful to observe."
5,Recommended for students of science and theology.,"How can science be reconciled with a belief in a God active in creation, not evolution? Faith, Science & Understanding explores different aspects of science and theology, defending the place of theology in the scientific world and discussing how religious ideas and can still coexist within the scientific framework. Recommended for any interested in the science/theology debate."
2,Not as good as you think it is.,"Sure, nice graphics. That's pretty much where it ends. Where MMORPGs strive to be something unique, this one fails brilliantly.I've read many reviews that say ""OMG!!11! teh grafics r soooo uber cool!!111!!1"". Children, one thing we've forgotten about games is that, sure, it can look great. But will you enjoy playing it? Will it give you the feeling that you're actually accomplishing something? This game does not.Let me share with you the negative points of this game:-Equipment price is outrageous.-Lag lag lag.-Nothing really interesting to do. Go out, kill, repeat.-This game is entirely PvP. Which means you're going to have 'veterans' come out and kill 'n00bs'. Not very fun for someone just getting into the game.-No point. I mean, what are you trying to do?So, with that said, don't waste your money like I did. There are other MMORPGs out there *ahem* Dark Age of Camelot *ahem* that provide much more than just a repeated formula."
1,Wrong item,I didn't get the little mermaid-when my comforter came it was go Diego go and I had to return it. I had to run out a few days before Christmas and buy it in the store. Thank goodness Target still had one...Next christmas I will just buy it in person-no more trusting something so important to online purchasing.
5,Love love love this game.,I played this game when I was younger (think the Leonardo DiCaprio craze) thinking it'd be based on the movie. It wasn't... but it was better. The game was a perfect mix of plot and history and the graphics were great for the time.My only concern is that there is no updated version of the game so I had to switch my computer settings to run 32-bit color (I think?) to make it display correctly. Ugh. It would also crash a lot. Well worth the frustration- though I have never stopped the darn ship from sinking. Oh well. =)A couple different alternate endings which made for lots of fun at the end.
5,"I think, therefore I review","Paulos is entertaining, awesome, etc. My first book by him I couldn't put down. I was so intrigued with Innumeracy that I even had a hard time finding time to do my math homework. Ironically, Innumeracy was ""advertised"" in the math book that I was working in. Really, any books by this genius is worth your time and money. ""I Think"" reminds me a little of Lewis Carroll, word and math games. Paulos does what all of these math wizards out there claim they can do: make math more palatable and interesting. I tried, ""Laugh With Math."" What? I wasn't laughing! Paulos, I believe, doesn't even have to try."
1,Swing dancing for men who already know how to swing dance,"These instructions are nearly impossible to follow - especially the women's steps. The tape starts out with slow, simple steps, but pretty soon, they start stringing together complicated series of steps without demonstrating the women's steps in slow motion. Even when they demonstrate the Dallas Side Pass, (where the man twirls the woman around twice in less time than it takes to say ""one-Mississippi"") they slowly show the men's steps, complete with close-ups of the feet, and then show the pair dancing together at full speed, with no demonstration of the women's steps. This is how *all* the steps are demonstrated beyond the first basic steps. They must think that men need extra help with dance steps and that women need no help at all! But even the men's instructions are too fast to follow, as my husband found."
2,Dated and biased,"I bought this book seeking the facts of this event. Instead I found a dated and biased viewpoint completely in favor of and defending the Southern whites' role, complete with innuendoes and name calling. If this is what you are seeking, then this is your book. If, however, you are interested in objectivity and even-handed reporting of an important event in Louisiana history, you should seek another source."
1,Does NOT fit Oreck Commercial Vacuum as advertised!,"This item was suggested as a ""bundle"" with the Oreck Commercial OR101 Premiere vacuum but does NOT work with that unit. DO NOT PURCHASE FOR THE COMMERCIAL VACUUM!"
5,The story of AUHSD,"This book covers the history of the Anaheim Union High School from it's early days to the 1980s when the quantity of schools was greatly reduced due to the separation of three of it's schools and closure of four others. The majority of the book covers Anaheim High School, considering that that was it's only High School until Western High School in 1957 (my Alma Mater c/o 2004). It was only by chance that I ever found this book as it has a rather ugly paperback cover and was easily hidden by the other volumes of the school library. Even though it is over 20 years out of date, it gives a good description of the early days of the District and the troubles it experienced in the late 70s/ early 80s. If only AUHSD would update it and re-publish it as it covers a vital piece in the history and development of Anaheim, California."
1,never got it.,"Never got it, notified two weeks after it was supposed to be in my home that it was no longer available."
2,Poor instructions,I received my cooker yesterday. The directions on the water to rice ratio are poor. There are no instructions for brown rice. I used the lines on the pot and got half raw rice. Adding more water did not help. There must be some trick to getting good rice. You will end up wasting rice to get it right.
1,What a mess!,"Fortunately this product was cheap because I am just going to throw it away. It makes a big mess in the kitchen, spitting water and rice liquids all over the counter. I only tried to make 2 cups (cooked) but it still just bubbled up and ran all over everything. Maybe it was the sticky rice but I tried others and it did the same thing. It is not worth the trouble to send back."
2,broke within a year,"This rice cooker is cheap and worked fine--until one day (less than a year after purchase!) it just died. I read on another product review that sometimes the thermal light goes out in these things, but I have no idea how to replace it. The last cooker I had was ugly and old, but it lasted for YEARS--wish I hadn't thrown it out."
2,Panasonic SR-G06FG3.3 rice cooker,It does not have keep warm feature. The cokker also failed in performance. Rice did not cook fully. I had to return the item.
4,A rice cooker that cooks rice,"I wanted a simple small appliance that cooks rice. I got a simple small appliance that cooks rice very nicely. If you want more, buy something else."
5,Perfect For Making Sushi Rice,"My wife and I enjoy making sushi at home but always hated how involved making the rice was. We got this little guy to try to simplify the process.This thing cuts the work in half when preparing rice. It's size means it makes exactly how much rice we need to make 8-12 rolls of sushi which is perfect for us.It doesn't look to fancy or have lots of buttons or displays, but it does cook rice very well.Recommended"
4,Great Cooker,Nice small unit. It makes about two and half cups max. Non stick surface is the best I have seen. It takes about 30 minutes to cook and it comes out perfect everytime.
1,great at first,"If you've never had a rice cooker this thing seems great, but after having it 4-5 yrs and getting wiser I can list several cons that should keep you away:1. non stick coating easily comes off. This stuff won't hurt you initially but the accumulation of this and many other toxins in our world undoubtedly has a long term effect2. when the non-stick coating comes off it exposes the aluminum underneath. See above.3. The timer is way off and tends to overcook the rice, invariably burning the bottom. I have to use a separate timer and turn off the cooker manually4. When cooking the sticky liquid bubbles around the sides of the cover making a mess.5. It cooks much less rice at a time than advertised. As an aside, I don't use it to cook rice anyway because it burns the bottom.6. For anything other than white rice the cooking problems are worse"
5,"Great little rice cooker, especially for a bachelor","I have nothing but great things to say about this little cooker. I use it about once a week and is so simple to use and clean. Just put in the rice and water, hit the switch, and 15 minutes later I have perfect rice. It is very simple to clean and the rice spoon that comes with it works great for getting every grain out and onto my plate. A great buy in my book..."
1,No More Panasonic,"It wouldn't work when I followed the directions, I have to manually push the button down in the bottom of the pan. When I contacted Panasonic and after multiple emails back and forth, their best solution is to ship it to a repair center to have it looked at."
3,not satisfied from the fist sight,"well, the rice cooker itself work well, but the funciong to price ratio is very low. if you a sigle and just need to cook rice, it is not a bad choice. it works. just that, not more"
2,Over cooks the rice,"The title says it all. Before i bought it, i read a review that said that it overcooks the rice, but since it was one review out of many i figured it was an anomaly. It didn't turn out that way for my rice cooker. I'm disappointed, i buy a lot of panasonic products, now i have to watch the rice and stop it before it burns."
2,Not as good as I've expected,Not as good as I've expected and other people claimed.I've been eating rice for 50 years.This doesn't cook as good as more expensive cookers.
5,Good cooker,"We have been using this for the past 1+ year and it has been working flawlessly. If you like rice, then having a rice-cooker like this one is a must."
4,Pip is a child who grows up wanting to be a gentleman .,Pip-- a normal little boy-- wants to be a gentleman b/c of a girl he met named Estella... Well Estella treats him so wrong along w/ her adopted mother Miss. Havisham which raises her to be cruel to the opposite sex.. Well one day ... well you just need to read this book ---- It's a thriller and a romantic but also sad in a way...
1,only good as a moisturizer,"I have used this product for over 6 months with absolutely no results. I admit that I haven't used it very regularly, but I would expect some benefit after using it for 3 days a week at least. I think this is just a very expensive moisturizer"
1,Hylexin doesn't work,"I bought this product and have used it for almost 4 months. There haven't been any noticeable changes. In fact, the product created a new problem with dryness because it doesn't hydrate well. This product doesn't work at all."
1,Didn't work at all!,"I really wanted this to work. I have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else. But I've been using this twice a day for two months and I haven't noticed any improvement at all. Not even a little. In fact, my eyes might actually look worse. It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags."
1,Poor performance and no OS X support - this is not woth the effort.,"We purchased a Book World Edition II for our office to use as external storage to be shared across multiple computers (Macs and PCs). It has been a nightmare.There is no OS X support. None. Although there are some hacks out there for accessing the drive using SMB for OS X, it is not a simple procedure and should not be considered a solution but more of a workaround.Also, although the Book World Edition II has a gigabit ethernet port, the backplane (the board that connects the hard drives to the ethernet port) is NOT gigabit. So don;t expect gigabit speeds from this drive.All in all, it advertises itself poorly and is difficult to set up and maintain. There are other options out there, and I suggest you research them."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I strongly dislike this product. I have used WD drives before without issue, so I didn't think twice before buying this one. I was enticed by the thought of accessing my data through a browser from anywhere in the world. DO NOT BE FOOLED. My drive continuously gets dropped or changes letter assignment, which makes backing up a nightmare. I tried using the WD Backup software but as I stupidly threw out the quick install guide, I am unable to get a product key. I refuse to put more money into this piece of junk. WHY would the company put a registration key on a quick install guide? How about a sticker on the disc? Ridiculous. I used it for the 30 day trial and have been struggling with it ever since. I wouldn't recomment this drive on my worst enemy. Save your money!"
2,"As of now, does not work with Vista","I would like to review this product, but as of now, there is no way for me to install it since there is no Vista support. I need to use the WS Anywhere Access program to do anything with the drive, and it refuses to install under Vista.Worse, there is no acknowledgment on Western Digital's site, and there is no User Forum to see what others have done for work arounds, if any."
1,Absolutely the Worst!,"I'm so fed up with this piece of garbage that it's not worth my time to review. However, I felt I should warn others. It is sooooo slow. I lose files almost everytime I move them to the external drive using the MioNet software that you are forced to use in order to share files. Retrieving files over the Internet is even slower than slooooooow. The drive has a hard time staying connected in the MioNet software (and thus, I'm sure this is why files become lost -- let me reemphasize: lost forever! -- don't ever move a file to the drive; copy them, and then do a compare to be sure they are there. Better yet, take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!).The drive is a great idea. Shame on a company like Western Digital to release such a poor unreliable device, that will surely destroy a lot of people's lives with the precious files they will lose."
1,Demise of a great franchise,I loved the first book! The second was kinda boring but i stomached it to get to the 3rd. I made it half way through this book and stopped.
3,Cheap plastic clip,"The harness still works, because the two metal rings can be clipped together with the leash. The plastic clip to hold the harness together broke the first time I put it on my pup."
3,Very comfortable to wear,"I received my mask in a reasonable amount of time. It is very soft and feels very comfortable on the eye. The only thing that would make it better would be if the nose area was more contoured to block more light. I had to wear it lower on my face. Other than that, its a nice product."
1,strap ripped,The elastic strap ripped off on the first night of use. I barely even stretched it trying to get it off my head. While it was on it was comfortable. Maybe I just got a defective one.
4,Soft and comfy on the face,"Soft, dense material, blocks out light and is easy to wear through the night. I'm weird about having things on my face and usually can only do sleep masks on airplanes if I'm desperate, but this one is actually pretty enjoyable to wear."
5,Super Awesome,"I heart this sleep mask. Its adjustable, it feels great, and it doesn't get hot. I bought one last year and my house burned down. I did not know how much I missed it until my new one came in I slept like a baby last night."
5,The best mask so far,"I had tried a lot of other masks (most of which were much more expensive) and this is by far my favorite. The material is very smooth and doesn't irritate my eyes or skin. The strap, although a little bit rough, keeps the mask on through the night. It is the best mask that I have had at blocking the light. The only real problem I had with this mask was the smell. I have asthma and allergies, so I could not tolerate the smell. I ended up washing the mask in the sink with some mild soap. After it dried, the smell was completely gone and the mask was still in perfect condition.The mask is also very durable. I bought it over a year ago and it still in good condition. There are two small holes on the outside, but they are mostly my fault and do not make it less effective. I would (and have) recommended this."
3,Is it worth $12?,"the easy answer is... NO. the smell of chamomile and peppermint was nice, but it lasted for a day. the sleep mask has an adjustable velcro strap which is great. the mask also has extra padding for the bottom part of your eyes, awesome. but is this item really worth shelling out $12 for? not at all, and you can find something cheaper that can do the same. it seems these reviews are a bit exaggerated IMHO. this mask covers your eyes from the sun, nothing more. i didnt notice any""refreshing feelings"" before bed or any change in sleeping quality. this product just covers the eyes."
3,Decent,"This isn't perfect. I've found that some days the mask can irritate my face a little fit because of the material. Also, the light just barely creeps in. Overall though, this is a good mask. The aroma originally that is placed in the fabric was a little weird, but not a problem."
2,Gave me Contact Dermatitis,"This sleep mask is decently made for the price, but it's been scented with something that broke everything it touched on my face out in itchy, stinging welts. My eyes were almost swollen closed when I woke up after wearing it overnight. Dermatologist diagnosed irritant contact dermatitis and put me on Prednisone for 6 days as well as a cortisone cream...not to mention the fact that I looked horrible for several days. I do not ordinarily have sensitive skin, nor do I suffer any allergies. Ugh."
5,It's soooooo soft!,"This mask is super soft, in truth I wasn't expecting it to be so comfy. The material is great, the mask isn't too bulky but it's still fluffy. Very pillow like. It smells wonderful! I almost bought a 25 dollar mask over this one and I'm glad I didn't cause I would have been wasting my money!"
4,Works like a dream,"Very simple, but totally does the job. The adjustable straps are very helpful, though they could use a little more velcro so that they could be made smaller for those of us with little heads. Keeps the light out, stays in place and doesn't put pressure on your eyes like some sleep masks do. Several customers have complained about the smell, but I can honestly say mine has very little odor. When I inititally opened the bag, there was a fairly strong herbal smell, however it seems that as soon as I got it out of the bag the mask was just fine. I catch a whiff every now and then, but it's nice and light. Highly recommended."
3,Rapid deterioration over time.,"I was very happy with the sleep mask initially. I only had one issue: since I have a head on the smaller side, the strap was a bit too loose. The way the velcro is situated made it hard to tighten, but I got it to work good enough.A few months into use, the strap got looser and looser and looser. At this point, with the velcro attached at the loosest position, there is at least a fist-sized space between the strap and my head. My fiance likes to joke about my tiny head, but it really is NOT that much smaller than the average person's head. So this seems like a problem with the product."
3,Just like any other sleep mask.,"Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Just like any other sleep mask. I own about five sleep masks. I can't sleep without them. I was so impressed by the five-star reviews I ordered this expecting something amazing. What I got was just an ordinary sleep mask. It works, Just not earth shattering."
5,Amazing sleep mask,"I was afraid I would find a sleep mask uncomfortable, but this one is divine! It's amazingly soft and comfortable and it works great, allowing me to fall asleep when my husband is still reading and to sleep a little later on Sunday. I think it had a bit of lavender fragrance at first, but luckily that did not last."
3,Better ...,"This sleep mask blocks a lot more light than the really cheap ones I've had in the past, but there are still gaps around the nose where light comes in. It's an improvement, though, and the texture is good."
2,Fail,"Here's the short version: the mask is made of fine materials, but is neither effective at shutting out light (it leaks in through both the edges and the nose) nor comfortable. There are no ergonomics save for an adjustable head strap (velcro). Oddly, there are two fabric pouches on the inside surface that touch your eyelids; decidedly uncomfortable. I know it's cheap, but even then not worth it. Oh, and it comes heavily scented with some aromatherapy incense which I could happily have passed on; your taste may vary."
2,the strap is uncomfortable,"The mask itself is soft and comfortable and cover my face nicely. However, the back velco strap is uncomfortable when I press my head against the pillow. I could totally feel it."
5,Lightly fragrant,"The performance/cost is wonderful. At first, the commodity is sent lately, but the producer give me an aplogize and rebate all the money to me. So thanks to it~"
2,Pretty to look at but not very helpful,"Beautiful mask, but the seams rub in weird places and the elastic is quite loose. It also gaps around the face and lets light in."
4,Fantastic retro pictures,"I love this version of Mother Goose rhymes for the pictures. It is full-color, and full of retro and fanciful drawings. It doesn't have all the rhymes or complete versions of some of them, though."
5,Will influence and encourage much thought,"Most people prove to be slaves to their minds. ""The Revolution from Within"" is a collection of thoughts and ideas from one of the leading spiritual philosophers of the twentieth century, J. Krishnamurti. Encouraging readers to be more aware of the constant changes in life all around them, and to break free of their mind's dominion over their souls, ""The Revolution from Within"" will influence and encourage much thought."
2,You Get What You Pay For!,"I just received my new Barska red dot. I didn't expect much for a whopping $14.95 on sale at the Sportsman's Guide. It is what I expected and a little more. Will update more after a shooting session. I will say that the optics are fair and the red dot reflection inside is fair to bad at the #11 setting. I have never been one to like ruby lens coatings and this scope just reminds me why. I plan on using it with a Ruger Mark II pistol. If I do not like it, I will not be out much. Well the scope held up to the recoil of a NEF 243 handi rifle i set up for my son. However anything past 75 yards gets covered up with the dot. A 10 inch circle to be exact. Not a good choice for deer hunting. My son is 12 this year and I moved him into a 3X9X42 scope. Not as easy and fast for him to get on target but way more acurate."
1,Not what I wanted,"Poor information,I wanted a pajama SET not just pants! Short on other company's ads means short pants and short sleves your ad is poorley writen. AND you did'nt issue credit for shipping,said it was not your fault,even after I explained the problem! I will be very carefull if I order from amazon again. Jack Feldkamp"
1,Rip off,by the picture of this item you think you will get a set shirt & short pants ALL YOU GET IS THE PANTS
3,"Good, but not Cunningham's best","This book is not just about nudes. Parts of the human body are present in every photograph, but the photos are not only of nude bodies. Hands, eyes, and ears are also explored. The work that is presented is very well done, and this book is valuable for completing coverage of topics Imogen Cunningham photographed, but nudes, or other body parts are a fairly small part of her work. The author mentions two decades where Cunningham did very little photography of nudes.Cunningham was primarily a portrait photographer. Portraiture represented nearly all of her commercial work, and much of her personal work as well. For this reason, I recommend ""Imogen Cunningham: Portraiture"" over this book. It's a better representation of her work, and as such tells more about the photographer. The biography, ""Imogen Cunningham : Ideas Without End : A Life and Photographs"" is also available and is a good introduction to her life and works."
1,Dissapointed... after looking forward to it for so long!,"I work with linens all day and a good iron is a must! From cotton to linen and silk, I iron it every day! This iron did not do the job for me. Weather it is an isolated incident or not I don't know. But the iron leaked on high steam, and low steam. There were water spots every time I moved the iron back and forth over my napkins. On silk, it leaves spots! I found a better one (Panasonic NI-C55SR) for almost half the price, that seems to do the job and so far no major leaks, maybe one per job... The only difference between the NIC55SR and NIC76SR is the anti-calcium system which is not an issue for me because I always use distilled water."
4,Damaged roots,"I went to a show that these guys were opening not expecting much, but they were the big surprise of the evening. The best way I can describe their sound is AC/DC meets the Gun Club.It's music full of dark, seamy undertones, raw blues rhythms and alcohol-fueled fury fronted by a pint-sized geek who can yowl like a baby Bonn Scott. See the Bloody Hollies at the worst kind of rock and roll dive and see what I mean."
5,Nothing else compares...,"I used both editions of Laws's book, Aquatic Pollution, throughout my Master's studies as an introductory text to environmental problems of the hydrosphere. I have found no other book to be equally informative. I recommend it to my undergrad class as a primary reference. The material covered is also suitable for beginning MS students, and the conceptual approach used is quite effective especially for those with no technical science exposure. Easy reading to be supplemented as needed with the more technical books like Stumm and Morgan's Aquatic Chemistry. Very adequate for introductory courses. I'm glad that the 3rd edition is due soon."
2,BORING..,"Conflict:Desert Storm II Is boring,theres only two good thing and that is 1)Squad Based Action and 2)Alot Of Missions.But that all there is to it.The music is annoying,The enemy soldiers are quite laem.I even preferred ShellShock:`Nam `67 over this.The Conflict series are good,but i HATE The Desert Storm games,Conflict:VietNam is good and Conflict:Global Storm is okay.If you looking for a good Tactical squad based action go for a SOCOM game,A Ghost Recon game or a Rainbow 6 game.seeyaa"
4,Think Twise This is a overnighter,"For starters this game has AWSOME graphics and gameplay. There is always something to shoot if you know were your going and what to do. Me and friends gave this a 5 star the first level,until we got to the last level.... level 8or10.The ending made no sense whatso ever we were expecting a shoot out with Saddam Hussien or something. This game was a bummer pikedit up at block buster a 9:00 pm done with it at 2:00 am. SO JUST A WARNING VERY VERY SHORT GAME."
3,A portrait of the artist as the daughter of a famous author,"The book is more a series of autobiographical short stories about a girl growing up first in Paris then on Long Island. Her father, a famous author (perhaps a stand-in for James Jones), is a complicated yet loving man capable of tremendous fury and tremendous love. The stories themselves are typical coming-of-age narratives, but they're graced by Jones' clear style and by situations above and beyond the ordinary. Worth a read."
3,"Skilllful writing ,pointless immoral narrative","Kaylie Jones displays a skill in writing and in describing scenes, situations, and characters somewhat in the style of her father.The descriptions of her home and her parents, as well as the time spent in Paris and America and the circumstances surrounding her brother's adoption and their relationships are,I know,somewhat autobiographical, but I find the general subject matter objectionable and of little merit. It is not a book I would recommend to a friend, but I would be interested in observing the future development of the author's literary talent."
5,Transforming book for personal discovery!,"Alan Mesher's new book, 'Just Who Do You Think You Are'...is one of the most indepth & insightful discoveries I have happened across in years! His thought-provoking context of life and helpful tools for shifting ones perceptions and choices is invaluable. I found his writing style a very easy read, and inspiritational in helping me address several issues in my life that have over the years been stumbling blocks in my relationship process. Many eye-opening revelations came to me without my having any expectations of the book being a conduit to directly apply to the context of my life, only to discover otherwise. Kudos to Mesher and his ability to make an impact and difference by sharing his proufound gift of writing and insightful knowlege...I will be forever grateful for the positive changes I have recently experienced as a direct result of applying the practices recommended in this outstanding book!...Truly a 'must' read!"
4,Starsky and Hutch are Cool,"This is a hot new game brought back to life thanks to Sony. S&H is a driving game and a shooting game in one. Thats even cooler when you play two player mode. One drives and the other shoots. Don't forget to collect huggie bears to access movies and shorts about Huggie, Starsky and Hutch. Although any game can get repetive after awhile, Remember to take breaks! I give this game 4 stars... Very Good Fun!"
2,Disappointing,I am a science teacher at a Job Corps and am always trying to find games that teach science skills. Since my students and I love crime solving and love the show CSI I thought the game would be great for our Fun Fridays. I was wrong. All of the teachers tried the game out on Christmas break and we hated it. It was slow and confusing. Don't waste your money or your time. I'm hoping I can think of a way to salvage the components of the game and turn them into a learning experience.
1,"Horrible, lame and a waste of time.","It's difficult to believe that anyone would like this game. Maybe a CSI fan would, but anyone that's played and enjoyed Clue might get annoyed at this pathetic and poorly designed copy. If you don't have it already, buy the timeless classic Clue and play it instead."
4,Colonists in an alien world,"This story of a group of people escaping an Earth wallowing in its own decay and eventual doom is very good though not as much as the author's other titles. I felt the author took too much time on getting the refugees to their new planet than was necessary and does not serve any purpose. Beyond that, the book is excellant and does not bludgeon you with its message as some authors do. The message is there, you just have to realize it. All in all, this book is a worthy read."
5,Great results,"I have used other micro fiber towels before, but never managed to achieve the kind of results I get from these. Ideal for all mirrors and polished surfaces around the home."
4,good quality for the price,"These aren't as thick or plush as what you can find in auto detailing shops (for $3 each), but these are good quality for half the price of the pro towels. Size is 16""x24"", which is a nice size for car detailing (maybe too big for indoor work)."
5,Works,"I use this when I clean my motorcycle, its great. I don't have any complaints. I am going to buy more"
5,They work as advertised,"I've mainly used these cloths for minor drying, cleaning and applying RainX to the windshields on my car and they work fine. They dry up fairly quickly and have served me well for the last 6 months.I double ordered these by mistake and I do think they are quite pricey but anyway, as long as they don't mark my car with micro-scratches, I'm fine with them."
4,Better ramen,"This ramen is better than the cheaper stuff you can get in your local grocery store. You get more noodles basically, which is nice. I wish someone would come out with an instant ramen noodles that had no MSG though.I wouldn't pay to have these shipped, but if you can add them to an existing order to get free shipping or if you have Amazon Prime, it's probably worth a try."
4,Still good after all these years,"I love this DVD. I owned it years ago in VHS and it was always my favorite. It is just the recycled version of the origional, but it is a good workout."
2,"Blade is nice, handle is cheap",We purchased this grass hook and when we received it we noticed that there was just a little movement of the blade in the handle. The problem with this item is that the blade is very nice and made in Austria but the handle is some cheap soft wood. After one partial use my husband had to stop using it because the blade was literally spinning in the handle and it was totally useless. I fixed it by jamming two round toothpicks and glue down into the handle to hold the blade in place. It seems fine now as long as my repairs hold but I would recommend you buy another kind of grass hook that is better made.
1,Not all that good,I have read some of her other books and they were really quite good but the language in this book was very stilted and the plot was just plain stupid. I am glad that I did not waste my money buying this book. The characters are not developed at all and although there is something of a love interest in the book - by the end of the novel when the hero and the heroine are together -I was really unsure why they even got together. Not worth reading.
2,Scandal in Heaven,"The narrator, 12-year-old Honey DeLoach, lives with her parents and 14-year-old brother in Heaven, Florida, (pop. 6) where nothing ever happens. Things do begin to happen when Miriam Season and her two daughters, Christmas and Easter, move into the huge home they have built down the road. Honey and Christmas become best friends, and Honey learns the value of strong family bonds. Honey's brother, Willie-Boy, learns some lessons too from the rebellious 17-year-old Easter. I'm not sure where this book is best suited. The odd-ball characters will not appeal to readers beyond 8th or 9th grade, but some of the salacious plot lines make it inappropriate for younger readers (Easter invites Willie-Boy to go skinny-dipping and later they sneak off together overnight: she's 17; he's 14).I think the author has tried to cover too much ground and missed the mark all around."
1,What the.....,I hate these cards. I just had to return my game because i didn't have a card. you shouldn't have to pay. this is just a scam to get more money out of you!
2,"Not enough information on ""How to"".","As a new pool owner, with no prior experience in pool care, I did not find this book to be particularly helpful. The book had a lot of information on what things were, and what needed to be done in terms of problem solving. Unfortunately the book neglected to share with readers how to do it. I would not recommend this book to new pool owners."
5,Best thermos bottle I've ever owned,"Before purchacing, I owned a thermos brand carafe made in canada. It did and still does keep coffee hot and I mean HOT for 16 hours or more. No other product could even compare with it. But It is old and delapitated so I was looking for something to take its place. This thermos by Nissan was garenteed to keep coffee at 155 degrees for 24 hours and it will. Its a great product if your looking to shut you coffee maker off after it brews to save electricity. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed."
2,There are better ones.,This thermos is huge. It does not stay cold too long. I have one that is about 2/3 the size that I use 4 ice cubes in and it stays very cold for almost 24 hours. This one I put 10 ice cubes into and they are all melted in about 12 hours. I wanted it for the size but I'm afraid my old one will be the go to.
4,Good performing product,"Have used for about a month and a half. It keeps my coffee at a drinkable temperature for 12 hours or so. But to acheive this performance it MUST be preheated with near boiling water, which can sometimes be more of a PITA than its worth. Fortunantly I always have access to near boiling temp water from my Bunn coffeemaker. Quite disappointed that the price has dropped $9 in the 45 days since I purchased mine. I wish Amazon's pricing was more consistant. I am now a lot more carefull when ordering from Amazon."
5,Amazing thermos,"This is my second thermos by this company. It is amazing. The water was piping hot 24 hours later. 48 hours later, it was still hot, hot enough that I wouldn't give it to my baby. I would definitely recommend this thermos."
2,Hot milk in the Thermos spolied in 6 hours,"I returned this item as i was disappointed when the hot milk i kept in the thermos was spolied in 6 hours only. I thought it will be good based upon ratings but was disappointed.Otherwise Capacity wise, its good."
3,rugged and simple,"If you are looking for an eye catching watch, this is not for you. This watch is simple and rugged and I use it more often than the others. I like the large numbers and if I wind it to the maximum, it will last for more than twenty four hours. I bought this watch for it's simplicity and appearance of ruggedness---to date, I am not dis-appointed.20June2012: I was wearing this watch and got sprayed in the rain (I was actually trying to keep it from getting wet),now it has a moisture inside. It is supposed to be water resistant up to 165 feet. Because of that, I am lowering the rating to three stars."
5,Well made good value,Very satisfied with the watch has a very good feel and build quality swiss movement is very accurate I like the vintage look of this watch definitely worth checking out
1,Awful Quality (Even for the price),These towels are awful. They shed all over the place and start to fall apart after a few uses. Avoid them.
4,Not a waste of time.,"This movie was surprisingly well done for it's age and unskilled actors. Don't get me wrong the acting was far from perfect but the message and image of suffering the movie was meant to portray is well conveyed. It leaves you feeling sorry for the people forced into legal slavery, just kids really. This kind of thing still happens in the world today in different places in the world and it's just heartbreaking to think about. This is a great movie to get people thinking about how we as hungry consumers actually aquire our products, from crude material, to what we see when we purchase it."
3,(NOT A REVIEW),"There is a new game coming out for PS2,XB & PC called The GodFather and Mafia will probably be its first match as they are both set in older times much before street gangs came in and grafitied,hit with baseball bats,wore greasy clothing,rode low riders and listened to ""Fowl-Mouthed"" Rap,no the times when groups of men drived posh cars,dressed in dark suits,listened to opera,wore shades,used a shotgun in black and white movies(who do you think is best the old 30`s 40`s poncy Mafia men or todays common street Gang""Sta""s?) by the way this is not a review i`m just talking about Mafia vs. The GodFather and i know this will happen but it will be also compared to those cartoony GTA series i hate those games now infact i don`t play crime/bad driving games no more(games like GTA,Driver,Getaway ect.) i am now a stealth-game junky(James Bond 007,Metal Gear Solid,Splinter Cell & Mission:Impossible game series) so i don`t use this genre anymore"
4,This game is great!,"First of all, why is everyone talking about GTA? Who cares if it's similar? All video games are basically rip-offs of each other, so what difference does it make? Besides, this game actually has an interesting story line--trying to become a ""made man"" in Mafia-ruled 1930's New York--whereas GTA is about stealing cars and killing people. THAT'S original. Mafia can be very challenging (i.e. FRUSTRATING) at times, but it just makes you want to play more. I highly recommend this game to all; it beats the heck out of a lot of the games out there. Oh, and while I'm at it, I'll also recommend Manhunt (really twisted but THOROUGHLY excellent)."
2,"Unless you are VERY patient, don't get it","This is a decent game (the only reason I gave it 2 stars). The story is great and it is a well developed game that goes along the lines of THE GETAWAY and GRAND THEFT AUTO III/VICE CITY. But the loading times are REDICULOUS!!!! They put missions on different parts of the city, knowing that you have a loading times across cities. Not only that, but the loading times are unbelivably long. It is a great game, but if you are not a very patient person, this game isn't for you. Take away the load times and this game is an easy 4 or 5 star game."
3,Elliot Ness should shut 'em down!,"i paid $5 for this. for that price, its worth it.i would be annoyed if i paid $50 or whatever its price would be as new.the load times are ridiculously slow. that alone is the biggest factor for my disenchantment.the storyline is just stupid. by the later chapters (i'm still trying to finish the game), i've forgotten who's who.the continuous ""don't shoot me! i have a wife and kids!"" makes me want to shoot the playstation itself.i often lose my bearings as the character approaches the corners of a wall in a stealth-like fashion. the orientation is lost, or the direction you are going. thats the best way i can explain this annoying issue.i'm glad i got it used. i dont hate the game, but again - $5 is about what its worth, considering the whole universe of gaming options."
5,Great Love Story,"This is a great book about two people who have loved each other for years, some of those years they were apart and this book deals with loss and rekindling a love too strong to deny."
5,must see,"you haven't really lived until you have watched Dietrich singing, particularly the 5 extra songs never released before! why were these shots cut out of the final tv show? probably on account of Miss Dietrich herself: viewing herself singing ""Johnny"" in her natal German language must have brought her back to the good old days, in Berlin, when she was a cabaret entertainer! well, believe me, she still was 60 years later!!! ""unmöglich!"" (impossible) for the goddess of screen who worked soooo hard to build her diva image for ever...you must see it! moreover, ""Go 'way from my window"", ""Marie Marie"", in French, or English or German, she's really moving, bringing nearlly the audience to tears...Was this really the face Miss Dietrich wanted to show? probably not...luckyly, now you can see the true Dietrich!"
3,Faulty Anamorphic Rendering,"Yes we should all enjoy this movie and be grateful it's available. HOWEVER......The producer of this issue settled on an odd, obscure aspect ratio of 1.66:1 as the basis for the anamorphic display. None of my machines know how to render an anamorphic to 1.66:1; they are expecting the 1.78:1 Widescreen standard. As a result they default to the standard Full Screen aspect of 1.33:1. It may flatter the actors by making them look slimmer and taller. But any other shapes we're familiar with (autos for instance) simply look weirdKnow when you buy this that you'll be looking at distorted video."
5,Long Way Back Home deserves a huge and growing audience,"Long Way Back Home is my first Gibson Brothers CD. I unconditionally love their music and lyric. Their ""Mountain Song"" words and rhythm beautifully inspire my clogging interests. ""Callie's Reel"" is a magnificent follow up. I am looking forward to choregraphing two dances to go with these two songs. I so love this CD I am going to look into their other CDs. Thanks for writing, playing and using one of Roy Hurd's songs that brought me to your site. Becky"
3,Goodbye Odor,"This product is discontinued & they will ship you goodbye odor. I can't tell if it helps or not, but my bunny doesn't smell. It might be the litter I use."
4,a welcome addition to the gay canon,"Gay youth everwhere have a new hero and his name is David! This movie is a refreshing alternative to the gay=consumer message of more mainstream representations of gay youth. If you loved Anthony Rapp in the broadway musical Rent, you'll like him as David (easily an extension of his Mark character from Rent, only gay!). Manheim is wonderfully funny and surpising and warm and forces our weight-ist society to see that bigger is sexier! But be forewarned, this is an indie first film and it shows (the dialogue and filming are sometimes hit-or-miss), leaving the viewer occasionally distracted from the story. This film is a welcome addition to the gay canon and video collections everywhere."
2,"Great sound, only if you could put up with the hissing ...","I bought this recently and regretted it. The sound is great but when you turn down the volume of the music, the hissing grows intolerable. I have another pair of wireless, a Sennheiser RS45 and there's no hissing at all, well not noticibly unless you pump up the volume to max. Well, wish I had read more reviews before jumping the gun. Hope this helps to warn others, who are thinking of buying. If you can put up with the noise (in between songs) go for it, the sounds fidelity is great."
2,Transmitter keeps shutting off,"I've been using the RF915RK on my computer for about two weeks now. When it is on, the sound is good, but occasionally the transmitter decides to shut down. (Red light on the unit goes off) ... As far as I can tell this seems to be related to input signal strength, but I've yet to determine a pattern, and it seems to be happening more frequently.After 6 months of using these headphones on my work computer, the transmitter is no longer stable. It switches off in the middle of a song, while there is still a strong signal. I do not recommend these at all."
2,Tinkerbell Toddler Costume,"The wings do not stand out, they are flat. She will not wear it because of this."
5,Great Trilogy,"The Raiders: Sons of Texas (Sons of Texas Series)This was a great series. I picked up the first book in the series by mistake thinking if another author. Was very glad that I did. I ordered the rest of the series from Amazon, along with several other books by Elmer Kelton. I have not had time to read the other books that I purchased but expect they will be everybit as good as this series was. I would recommend these books for anybody that likes stories about pioneer life."
3,Good Sequel,"voice talents in this are great. It's a bit more upscale then the orignal, but has some good music in it. Animation is alright as well. My kids like it and that's the important thing."
5,Better Than the First,"With an all-star cast and great music, my kids love it (yet sometimes I think I am enjoying it more):-} Fast delivery too."
1,This is just weird,"Am I the only one here who's weirded out by disney's new in-betweener stories? Also I agree with a reviewer below that this isn't a real sequel. It's just about baby Tod and Copper all over. Yawn.... Please, save your money. Buy the classic movies or a real disney sequel instead."
2,incorrect charge,the movie was good but I should not have been charged as I am an Amazon Prime member and am frustrated at the time taken to correct it
1,A little too baby-proof...,"These outlet plugs are terrible. I inserted a few into outlets and then wanted to double check that I could remove them before I baby-proofed the rest of my outlets.Good thing I checked, because the three I inserted will not budge despite my best efforts. I may not be able to use those outlets ever again. Do not buy this product."
5,freaked me out when i was a kid!!!,"First of all, IT IS WIDESCREEN!, contrary to popular belief. There is no option for it in the menu, however. You must choose the tv aspect thru the setup options in your dvd player. It took me awhile to figure that out!! Ok...on with the review. Definitely my favorite 70s-80s horror movie. The kill scene at the beginning (one of the best ever) freaked me out when I was about 10 years old. The kill scene towards the end made MY heart stop! If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Tanya Roberts (HOTTIE) first movie, I believe. A must for any fan of 'b-movies.' Watch it , then watch it again with the running commentary---you'll learn a few things! Don't want to spoil it for you with play by plays of the whole movie"
4,Chuck Connors as a Killer??,"I bought this movie because my husband is a big Chuck Connors fan (and I am a big horror fan) and i wanted to see how well the two combined in this DVD. Its campy, quirky, completely unbelievable and utterly hilarious at times. Lots of gore, and a still handsome Connors make this a great buy for any horror/comedy fan, Chuck Connors fan or anyone who loves ""B"" movies."
3,"""Copelia"" on Crack with Bland Special Features","""Tourist Trap"" is one of those accidental works of genius that the anything-goes seventies horror-machine churned out. Like ""Phantasm,"" it's as much fun to describe as it is to watch: Chuck Connors as a psychic psychopath with an army of killer mannequins!Unfortunately, the special features on this DVD edition are pretty terrible--almost all of them are advertisements for other Full Moon pictures. And director David Schmoeller's intermittent commentary is unenlightening and dull."
2,Don't believe the hype,Its not Tourist Crap but the movie is okay. The wannabe Leatherface guy was errie. But it was not the classic that everyone makes it out to be. It didnt really have and suspense. I fell asleep on it a few times.I don't have too many really positive reviews for this movie but I like that wax idea and the chessy factor in this movie. They tried. But oh well. I say don't buy it. If you like borrow or rent it. You be the judge. If you but it just don't expect the Exorcist like everyone says it is. Its better than that crappy movie The Tenant. Never ever buy that movie.
4,This old campy horror film is still entertaining,"It's been about 30 years since I last saw this film, and its as silly and campy as I remember. Not too gore-y with enough suspense to keep you engaged. Good flashback rental."
3,Cards,"The cards are good. I don't care for the way they are set up. They have the Spanish word plus the English translation on the same side, not good for doing drills. Secondly they have several cards that are the same object. We had three or four stars. I can see using two, one for the color and one for the object but there was no cause to have 3 or 4. There were a few like that. I expect I will divide the cards into sections and use them separately since using them all at the same time just irritated my daughter as she kept thinking it must be a different word I was looking for since she had already done that word.The quality of the cards is nice though. And we liked that the pictures were bright and cheerful."
5,African Guitar - A fantastic Intro,"For those of us raised on Eric Clapton, Jimmy Hendrix, Lee Ritenhauer, and many other ""western"" guitarists, all great in their own right, there's a whole other world out there, and African Summit II is a great place to start exploring African guitar and rhythms. It's complex, danceable, and....fantastic! Buy it. You won't regret it!"
4,Yard Butler Aerator Works,"Good product, pleased with the purchase so far. Seems well-built, sturdy. Does what it is supposed to do. Because it just has 4 spikes, it will give you a workout if you do a large area. But good for small yards."
4,An excellent introduction to Japanese corporate culture!,This well-written and thought-provoking book outlines some key differences between American and Japanese corporate culture--with a sense of perspective and a touch of humor. I highly recommend it to Americans working with Japanese firms...and it may be of interest to Japanese businesspeople wondering how younger Americans view their professional ethos.
4,Great camera,"Be sure to buy GOOD quality disposable batteries if you don't have the rechargables yet. I went to a dinner party last night with NEW batteries from a name-brand (though not the big ones), and my camera would not turn off (yes, it would NOT turn off), and would not function when it was on. Usually you would think bad batteries would simply cause the camera not to work, but instead I got a bunch of strange errors that made me think the camera (brand new) was defective. Once the batteries were changed however with Duracell (love those guys), it worked fine. I'm going to start charging up the new rechargable batteries I got.The camera's a dream. The zoom feature is amazing, and the megapixel count really allows you to digitally zoom in. You can even zoom around on the LCD screen of the camera. Good job HP!"
5,recaptures the magic of 1968,"This is truly an enjoyable book- especially for those who lived it in the city...it was a chance to be there again. This mentions all the big plays, players and events during this wonderful, healing summer in Motown. Lolich, Cash, Kaline, the Gator, Denny and the rest of the cast bring back all those happy emotions and feelings. If you were there in '68 then buy this one to read, keep it and then pass it on to your grandkids when you die."
5,You should really read this book!,Well i'm only 11 years old but this book was still one of the best books that I have read. But I read the 3rd book first so in the beginning of the book I already knew what was going to happen. But after I read the book it really got me thinking and the end of the book really got to me.
4,Appears in movie MONEYBALL,"I believe this book appears in the movie MONEYBALL, about a bottom ranked league that rises to near the top in one season by huging statistics aggressively. The statistician (played by Jonah Hill) has it on his desk in Cleveland the first time the lead actor, the manager (played by Brad Pitt) meets him."
4,Inspiring me to take up collage,"I got this book last week and have just now ordered a couple of ""how to"" collage books from this website. I love the idea behind Lenore Tawney's postcards - tiny, personal offerings to friends and family from a real talent. I think this book shows what is achievable on a small piece of card with a lot of imagination.The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I would have liked to see more narrative - some commentary on each of the collages would have been a welcome insight and only added to what is an inspiring book."
1,Cheap Earrings,"I bought these to make my order qualify for free shipping. They were worth that. . .but not for wearing. The glue connecting the earring to the finding did not hold, so they were broken in the bag. Oh, well. . . I got my free shipping."
2,Too Broad,This book has a lot of interesting facts and historical references but it isn't the narrow facts that someone who is completely new to the topic may want. I was hoping that it would go straight to solid answers but instead I had to read through a bunch of assumption and irrelevant historical facts before getting to what I really wanted to know.
3,"Good Intent, Needs Editing","I expected more from someone with Helen Lee's experience in Journalism. The book gives little actual information, and focuses instead on rambling conjecture. Though I respect the intent and agree with many of the sentiments, the structure of the book is poor and unfocused. I would recommend this book only as the most basic of introductions to rastafarianism; for anyone who knows even a little, I would suggest you look elsewhere to enhance your knowledge base."
3,"Quirky, promising, but he held too much back...","I am newly acquainted with Hawksley Workman, and bought this after hearing one song of his from his much stronger CD, 'Last Night We Were The Delicious Wolves', which I highly recommend. On 'Treeful of Starling', I got the impression that somehow he was holding his passion back - and although the song lyrics are interesting, the vocals and arrangements are kind of simple and less developed. His voice reminded me of the vocal love child of Harry Nilsson and Jonathon Richmond (& the Modern Lovers). Perhaps this particular CD is for true fans, but not a place to start."
4,"physical comedy with a mormon twist, and a spiritual message.","This movie was great for the most part. A few over-the-top comedy skits, but mostly just good, clean, physical comedy. I loved it, and the best part was the great message at the end. A must-see modern mormon film."
1,Defective unit.,"I have purchased these at Walmart before, and have had no problems. Bought one from Amazon, and the first time I used it the sprayhead was defective, spraying NOT from the nozzle, but from the bottom of the head, spraying all over, including my hand. From now on it's Walmart for this item."
3,doesn't work for all plugs,"Finally I found a cover that is large enough to cover the baby monitor plug! Unfortunately, it doesn't work for our plug that has a hole on top and bottom rather than a center hole. If you have older plugs, this will work for you. If not, I have yet to find a product that will work.I am always astounded by the number of simple things for babies that have yet to be produced. Is a cover that fits a baby monitor plug that works with modern electical too much to ask??That said, we just plan to drill a couple of holes in the thing to make it work."
5,Somewhat theft-proof,"At first look I was disappointed because it looked flimsy to me. My wife grabbed it, and said it was a great gift for school (nursing student) and it works good. The initial cheap look keeps it from being stolen but it is actually a very good product."
1,Worst Book I Ever Read,We're All Doing Time: A Guide to Getting Free. I bought this book thinking I would gain more understanding of what my family member was experiencing in prison. What I received was an unhelpful book on the writer's view on yoga and spiritualism along with offensive inmate drawings. I didn't find anything in the book I believe helpful to me or the inmates for whom the book was written. I bought 2 copies of this book and plan on burning both.
1,PORQUERIA Y ABURRIDA,Es la novela mas aburrida que me he leido en mi vida. De verdad no se la recomiendo a nadie.
2,Clasp broke the first time Husband wore it!,"This is a nice-looking necklace. However, the clasp broke when my husband first took it off so now it sits broken on his dresser. This was a Christmas present to him. Usually Amazon sells high quality items so I was surprised. We paid $150 for it. I have to stop procrastinating and check Amazon's return policy or take it somewhere for a new clasp now."
5,Greatest Sci Fi Book of all time,"I've read this book like 5 times. Every time I couldn't put it down till I was done. I've lent it to many other people and alas, it's now gone forver. Amazon can't get it either (I've tried 8 billion times too). This is the book that relly got me into Sci-Fi. This book is from the guy who wrote the the battle dragon series (which is really good, but the more recent ones havn't been that great); and the style is similar. If you can find this book somewhere, you have a treasure."
1,Truth?,"This book only shows one side of the coin. It makes ""saint"" Josemaria de Escriva look like an Idol. They idolatrize him. It never says the bad things this dirty man did. Its a shame how blind people are. There are some other good books about Opus Dei that show the good side and the bad sides of it.The truth will set you free.I lost a friend because of religious differences, he became a fanatic of Opus Dei, he was brainwashed. I keep praying for him."
4,Very good,I enjoyed reading this book as much as the previous two in the series. The finding of Menni and the death of Amero were both surprising.
3,spice rack spacing,"I find this product adquate. However, the space between shelfs does not accomindate off the shelf spice bottles, & you have to buy and transfer to smaller bottles. I do not think anyone researched properly before manfacturing product."
3,"Jason Potter (see below), you're absolutely right about Gertrud...","...you almost couldn't have put this better. Watching the movie I thought the former lover who became famous reaped what he sowed, and thought the husband should have been celebrating that Gertrud had left him. Gertrud is the epitome of narcissism dressed in an artsy-fartsy/haute couture veneer--as you say, a character ""in love with Love"", but completely unable to experience love because she is too self-centered to follow the principles that guide healthy relationships. It's fun to look at the lighting, object placement, and use of the screen in this picture because everything is so perfectly laid out. But the character the movie focuses on is a despicable one that could only get praise from other similarly narcissistic human beings--and believe me, in the world of 'film' there are plenty of those, hence why Gertrud the character and Gertrud the movie are so overrated."
1,"god, i hate this show...","yeah, its that bad people! first off, let me say the characters are hella ugly and look really old! i got really bored and tired of the lame storys and relationships(which none of them had any chemistry). don't buy. i can't believe it lasted two seasons. thankfully, it is now cancelled!"
2,Good Hip Hop - Not Good Latin Mix,"Good Hip Hop and rapping. Not good fusing of Latin Mixing though. Can barely hear the Latin rythem and beats to be able to dance the samba, rumba, cumbia, salsas, etc..."
3,"good music, but NOT Cuban","I loved the film and really like the music...but it's not really Latin, it's REALLY not Cuban music. But it is danceable and it is *good* music.That shouldn't stop you from buying this CD. I did. But I knew what I was getting :-)"
4,simply great,"Je suis une grande fan de danses latines et suis tombee en amour avec cette trame sonore. Quoique je n'ai pas tellement apprecie le film, la musique est tout a fait enhivrante ."
4,My 4 year old loves to play,"It's a simple memory game but because it's Disney Princess, she loves it!"
1,high failure rate,"Do not buy this monitor. I bought about 12 for our company and the failure rate is about 60% now. Of course just after the 3 year warranty, they started failing. They are in a contolled environment were other monitors also exist with no trouble."
2,Failed after a few years,The monitor was fine for a few years. I rebooted my computer one day and the monitor never came back on. It appears to have had an internal failure. I have had an LCD Samsung for over six years and it is still going strong. I will avoid ViewSonic from now on.
2,Let down,"Well, where do I start?The Good: Fast ship Amazon/Tiger Direct, Good looking on my deskThe Bad: Fuzzy display, had been previously opened, lower right hand portion of screen display lighting/fuzzy, Auto Pivot does nothing. I have a high end system, the Samsung 170T I replaced ran 1280x1024 in digital mode -this VP2030b only wants to run analog (1600x1200) on my BFG GeForce 6800 GT OC PCIe. :( A few things to try and it is going back (one is a note to BFG tech support, I will get an answer from them faster). OF NOTE: TIGER DIRECT IS GOING TO CHARGE A 15% RESTOCK FEE FOR THIS -NOT FAIR-."
4,"A well written, entertaining introduction to raising cattle","While a bit redundant @ times, I found this to be an excellent treatment of cattle-raising. I am a novice to ""cattle ranching"" and have found it very useful and easily read; also, well indexed. A few ""oldtimers"" have found it very useful and have asked where they can get one. The practicality is enhanced by good illustrations."
4,a great starter book,"My wife and I just started in the cattle industry. I have horses and rode bulls but never had to take care of any type of cow. We purchased a bred cow that was expecting any moment and were kinda intimidated by the whole thing, the people we got the cow from recomended this book because they said if they had this book starting it would have saved them a few times. It is a good basic guide to cattle, it covers a broad spectrum of problems and issues that a cattle rancher might come across. All in all this is a good source for information and I would recomend it any one interested in raising beef cattle for the first time."
5,A great book to own and share,I was raised on the recipes found in this book. Diane makes even the most seemingly complicated recipes manageable. I gave the book out as gifts this holiday season. I highly recommend it.
3,The Kat that quit too soon.,"Well I had bought this because my dad has used one for about 5 years now. So naturally I bought one. Now it's been a little over a month of having installed the Kat's 14600 in an 81 mercedes 300 SD. Went out last night to check on it because of a sneaky suspicion, lo and behold, the heat wasn't there. So I am hoping it was just a faulty heater if not then need to find another heater for the car."
3,Depending On What You're Looking For,"Well, this book is definitely great for readers who seek to find out what's wrong with their spiritual health from a shrink's point of view--you have some issues with certain things, the book points out why you feel or believe that way, then, the book advises you of ways to overcome such shortfalls by adopting a different mental scheme, such as, telling yourself that life shouldn't be easy when you encounter hardships. However, this book does not work for readers who are seeking for a holistic view of the universe, and thereby apply such views in overcoming the problems they face each day. In other words, if you don't have the psychological symptoms as discussed in that book, you won't find the book very useful."
4,looked a long time,"I looked for a long time for the right spice jars, I wanted something with a wide mouth, big enough for measuring spoons and I did not want a spice rack with it. These are perfect little jars, holds whole bay leaves, I plan on purchasing more sets for christmas presents."
2,Page numbers are continuous but there is a page missing,"Has to be an error at typesetting, because the page numbering is continuous with no breaks but the page largely discussing Pringles is missing."
2,"If spidey himself played it, he would be disoriented","This game is visually breathtaking, has the feeling and edge of Spider-Man, and makes sense based on its progression. Yet it stinks. The controls are awful. It is simply impossible to adapt to the feeling of this game without investing a great deal of time and frustration. And it simply isn't worth it."
3,"Spider-Man, Spider-Man...","Well, this game is good. The graphics are good and it is fun. But the down side is the camera. I found it too confusing to control Spidey. I prefer the control of Halo or Max Payne to this game, which reminds me dreadfully of Resident Evil's.If you like Spider-Man get this game. The animation is good and the extras to unlock are fun...a little for the adult minded, but fun indeed.I found that my TV had too much red and had a halo like haze around him, but after some adjustments I was able to be happy about it."
4,Spider-Man Preview,"I have not played the game yet but on ign's website it said that the Xbox version has better lighting effects and textures than the PS2 one and slightly better graphics than the Gamecube version, also the Xbox version is the only one to have 2 bonus levels with Kraven the Hunter. They also said said that this version has the steadiest framerate of the 3, so if you have more than 1 next-gen system it sounds like the Xbox version is the one to buy."
1,Spiderman on the Xbox,"Somewhat disappointing on the Xbox, maybe I was expecting too much. The camera angles are somewhat annoying always a minute late during heavy action scenes. Controls seem to invert at times especially while wall crawling. Good background music."
3,"JUST OK, BUT NOT GREAT","I also own Spider Man for Dreacast and it seemed an aufull lot like it ,and I began to wander why I spent 200$ on an XBOX. I got bored right away and went to trade it in. So I didnt give it a full chance but I feel like the only thing some of these games offer are the little movies inbetween the stages. If you've never played spider man on any other console you'll like it. To me, It was like reading a novel then going to see the movie on the novel, then reading a book on the movie ,then playing the video game made on the movie based off the novel. I liked the Dreamcast version that I paid 15$ for better. The graphics are cool, but the game control frustrated me a bit. If I had a more new open mind I probably would have liked it."
3,"a good, entertaing read","This book by Richard Stark catches your attention from the first and is able to take you through the entire book. The main character is one you would not like to meet, but he is one that you would like to know perhaps. He is a criminal and a good one at that. Interesting book.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,Don't let the movie fool you-NOT WORTH IT!,"I saw the movie and I loved it. Then, the game came and I bought it immediately. Three days later, I put it in my game drawer and left it with my N64 and PSX games. It's been there for over six months. The levels are challenging, but there aren't very many and none take more than an hour. Pinhead Bowling does last forever, and it's the closest to two player the game has. Get codes, too. The codes are great. I give it three stars because it's a good game, but I wasted $$$, and so will you if you buy this."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,This game is not worth buying. If you want a good Spider man game pay the extra money and buy spider man 2. You will be glad you did.
5,A Totally Action Packed Game,"This is one of the best games I've ever played!! One of the best features is that not only do you get to play spiderman but you get to play other characters like Shocker, Mary Jane, thugs, a scientist, Peter Parker in his wrestling costume, and the best villian of all, the Green Goblin. I rented this game at a video store but my mom is going to buy it for my birthday."
4,Fun Sandbox but a little flimsy,We were really excited to get this sandbox and my daughter has a blast in it! The only disappointment was that it is a little flimsier than I imagined from the pictures. Once it has sand in it you barely notice but picking it up for the toy store I was a little surprised. Totally worth the money and great toy!
4,Not comfortable for play,"We own this sandbox. I like its color, but there are two key improvements I would make. First, the plastic ""stones"" at the four corners are quite uncomfortable to sit on. So you and your child will need to sit in the sand to be comfortable. They should have smoothed out the corners for comfortable seating. Secondly, it's great that it has a lid, but although our three year-old can remove the lid fairly easily, she cannot replace it by herself. I've seen sandboxes with hinged lids, and wish we had chosen one. Finally, if you do get this sandbox, drill holes in the bottom before placing it your yard. That way if you ever leave the lid off during a rainstorm, the rain will be able to drain out of the sandbox."
5,Great sandbox / pool,"This came well boxed and a reasonable shipping time. Before putting sand in it we used as a wading area for the 3 toddlers. Just the right size and appears to be very durable. Nice little seats in the corners, too."
5,Birthday gift,"I purchased this sand box as a birthday gift for my four year old granddaughter, thinking it would be a good size for two kids. It really is big enough for four. Construction wise, it should last for a long time. I am very pleased with my purchase."
4,Great purchase!,"I bought this sandbox for my nephew. He absolutely loved it. It looks great in the backyard too. I was debating on whether I should get him the turtle box, but I just thought it would look tacky in their yard. Its a great product and I recommend it!"
4,Two toys in one,"We've had this sandbox for just over a month. In that time, the table has withstood several major storms and lots of toddler playtime. My daughter is barely 2 and around 31 lbs. She loves to climb the plastic lid. I often lay it next to the sandbox and she has a grand time climbing the lid and jumping into the sand. About the only drawback I've found is that the lid's design--a sun with a sort of raised geometric grid around it--is a great raincatcher. Since we play with the box every day, any rainwater is quickly disposed of but I can see where it would be a nice mosquito breeding ground during vacation times."
2,"Good Design, OverPricedddddd","We like the design of the toy. Especially the removable lid. But it is very overpriced for the quality of material used. Last year we purchased a 60"" round pool from Ace Hardware made with exactly the same material for $20. The pool lasted 1 summer, due to the elements outdoors."
2,Not worth the money,"These dive rings are a waste of money. The packaging says, ""soft, flexible material"" yet they are made of a hard plastic. It took one throw for the penguin's nose to fall off and after playing with them at the pool for one day a good amount of paint is scraped off the characters. Although two of the characters float, they took in a little bit of water, which cannot be removed. Leaving it in there will cause the eventual mold. Not to mention having two floating in a set of ""DIVE"" toys is a little ridiculous. In my opinion, the cute faces don't make up for the extra money. I should have bought the plain ones."
3,Topples over easily,"The intent of this colorful,well-made toy is sound, but the clown tilts to one side, causing the wooden cylinders to easily topple off; it's difficult to play a simple balance game with children."
2,My kids never play with this game,"This was a Christmas gift last year for my two boys (then ages 3 and 6). I guided them through playing with it a few times, but they did not like how easily the clown fell. The smallest bump would cause it to fall. When the pieces fall, they roll across the room, distracting my kids from the actual game. For them, the game looked more fun than it actually was. It was simply too frustrating to play, so we put it away. I brought it out again after a few months, with similar results. My kids never ask for it. The toy is sturdy and colorful. The potential is there for learning about weight and balance, if it stays up long enough. I am disappointed because it seems like it would be fun, but it just does not hold their attention."
1,I dont give it anything (not even a one for good effects),there are too many things wrong with this movie. if you like it you've never read the book. i read the book after i say this movie. it was a complete disappointment of a movie. NEVER see it
1,"Nothing more than a Star Wars ""A new Hope "" remake!","Am I the only one that see this. Lets review. It begins with a princes (Leia) runing with a stolen secret from the bad guys, that get in the hands of a farmer boy (Luke)raised by his uncle. This boy then discover he is no ordinary boy and that he have a great ancient power (the force), meets an older guy who in the past was a great warrior of the same kind (Obi Wan)and (after his family dies) take him under his wing to teach him. They go on a jouney where he saves the princes, but his old friend dies in the rescue. There is also a joung rebel (Han Solo)who help him, and in the end he saves everybody.I could only guess that in the second part we will discover that Galbatorix is Eragon's father!!"
2,A Kiddie Movie,"Unlike the recent fantasy master pieces, this plot is skewed and thin-thin, the only hope the movie had was in an excellent delivery. Special effect were nominal at best; action was less than that thanks to its PG or child audience. The dialogue might have been the worst. The characters delivered there lines all they were reading them off cue cards, often causing the audience to laugh. As I said, ""A Kid's Movie."" If you won't notice the bad acting, won't notice the lack of plot, and won't notice the lack of action this is your movie! Other wise, I'd wait for Night in the Museum."
1,zero stars,"it is so bad i could not even finish watching the DVD. this is just another of the tired hollywood underdog movies, change stars wars ""the force"" for a dragon and that is the movie. except this one makes no sense at all, is cliche filled and is terrible. a question i have is, why is the leader of the whatchamacallitsecretninjaguys black when there every other character in the movie is white? the typical pass the torch scene, or sword, is done no less than 3 times between eregon and jeremy irons character. so what is eragon? is it dragon with an e instead? i thought it may be a name of a place, castle or something but some dumb kid? give me a break. john malkovich is in this movie just to make some $ and is a clownish bad guy. why is the evil wizard so scared of some old bald dork king?this movie makes no sense, it has no story, the acting is bad, it is full of stupid cliche's and must have been written for the D&D; dork crowd that would find this drivel entertaining.yuck!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Used Eragon DVD,"Yes, I read the book Eragon and was disappointed when I saw it at the movie theatre. This was a good value for the price. Don't expect much from the movie (especially if you read the book). I bought this for my cousin and saw it to make sure it was in good condition. Also, going to finish reading the book series, so the movie helped remind me of the first book."
1,AWESOME book Miserable movie,This movie tried to recreate a masterpiece of a book. Well it failed. They took out parts of the story that made it interesting and underdeveloped Eragon as a character. Read the book you wont regret it!!
3,*sighs*,"I will admit I had been skeptical about the movie but I thought ""what the hey, I'll check it out"". I should have read the books first. Really I should have. I spent the entire time watching this movie with my mother and could not help but sit back making little cracks in hopes to lighten the disappointment I felt for it. Some of the acting was a little stale. Some of the scenes could have been built up so much better. The movie felt like it was made entirely too fast and left out a lot of substance. It could have been so, so much better. Kind of like with the Dungeons and Dragons movie with Marlon Wayans."
1,A disgrace to an amazing book.,"This movie made me very sad, it could have been amazing, but it was horribly distorted. This is not the book that Christopher Paolini wrote.I am aware that the WHOLE book cannot be made into a movie, due to time issues, but they could have done a MUCH better job than this. Everything about it (except for Jeremy Iron's performance, he is AWESOME) was utterly horrid. I hardly think that a second movie would be possible, due to how much they cut out.Also, it does not annoy me that they cut things out as much as it annoys me that they changed things that they did not need to! For instance, Saphira's appearance, Arya's hair color, the color of the jewel in the sword that Brom gave to Eragon, etc.Do not buy this movie, even when I don't compare it to the book it is still pretty bad."
2,How bad could it really be?,"I read the book before seeing the movie. All the reviews I've read said how that was a mistake, but The Lord of the Rings movies weren't entirely faithful to the books, but they were still great movies; so, I thought how bad could this movie really be with such good source material.All I can say is that the screenwriter must have just flipped through the novel, stuck their finger down and said ""Here - let's write about this scene"".After watching the movie, I listened to the beginning of the Director's Commentary - I got as far as Saphira's growth spurt where he said ""look at the dragon's expression, even she is surprised at how fast she has grown"". He could have concluded that sentence with ""...and doesn't know what is going on."", I think that would have captured the spirit of this movie.I feel sorry for Jeremy Irons - once again he gives a stellar performance in a truly crappy movie (re. Dungeons & Dragons)."
2,OK for light entertainment,"Caveat: I've not read the book, so I won't experience the same disappointment that fans of the book have expressed. That said, I've seen worse movies. It's certainly derivative, arbitrary, and more than a little rushed. However, it's acceptable for viewing, not too intense for the younger set, and has relatively few ""cringe moments"". 2 1/2 stars would be about right - as would picking up the DVD out of the bargain bin for a casual movie night."
2,Once was enough,"I saw ""Eragon"" in the theatre. While the concept was interesting, the execution somehow fell short. If you haven't seen the film and you want to-just rent it. Don't buy this film unless you have seen it and you want to keep it in your collection."
1,poo,OK i am a huge fan of all the books and have already preordered the last one so when i saw this movie it made me want to throw the tv out the window. this movie isnt even based on the novel. DO NOT WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,If you have read the book....,"do NOT watch the movie. I love the books but avoided the movie due to bad reviews. However, I hoped that maybe it was just a case of ""it's not EXACTLY like the books"" (like people who complain about the Harry Potter series). At first I was going with some of the changes since there is no way they could fit all of the detail into a 2 hour movie. By the end, however, I was mortified. I have never seen a book that badly mangled by a movie. I am surprised that the author allowed it since the movie changed the ending so badly that Eragon's character itself is changed. Dissapointing (although, if you have no intention of ever reading the books, then you may enjoy the movie as is, which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than the 1 it deserves)."
5,Eragon in Blu-ray is beautiful,"The movie fails to translate the wonderful story of Eragon to the screen very well, but overall its not so bad. The special effects, however, are wonderful. The scenery is beautiful and the dragon look very real. Its a great movie to watch to appreciate your large screen HDTV."
5,I loved it!,"I disagree with most of the few reviews I read here. I loved this movie. It is probably true that the movie doesn't follow the book as closely as the diehard fans would have liked but for someone who hasn't read the book (but would like to), but loves movies, it was great. The moment in the movie where Eragon asks Saphira if she's ready and she breathes out a blast of fire has stuck with me more than any other part of the movie because it said more than any triumphant ""YES!"" could have."
2,Way worse Than I Expected,"It was a really bad movie. I read the books, and they were really good. The movie completely destroyed the story. I expected it to be much better. They left out lots of important parts of the book out. The characters were nothing like they described in the book. The 103 minutes they used were NOT WELL USED. They spent to much time on certain parts of the movie. Definitely read the books first. The special effects were the best part. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because of the special effects. Saphira and the Shade were definitely the best characters. Eragon and Roran looked too much alike! They also revealed things too early and changed the entire story. They didn't explain many things that were explained in the book, making it confusing for people who haven't read the book. My friend was reading the book, but after watching the movie she didn't want to keep reading because she was afraid the book would be too much like the movie. IT'S NOT!!!!!!!"
1,Disappointment,"If one hasn't read the books, this movie is a nice stand-alone. Great scenery and good acting. Had it not been associated with Eragon the book, I would have thought differently about the movie. However, Eragon the movie sadly disappoints when a faithful reader compares it to the way the Harry Potter movies and Lord of the Ring movies clung to the essences and details of their relative book series. Eragon the movie is beautiful but holds practically none of the feeling of the books and, worse, doesn't even really correspond to the story line or the characters and their developing relationships. The details of the movie just don't match up with the books. I can hardly wait to read the final book in the series, but I really regret having wasted my time and expectations on the movie."
2,Not the best,"I read the book and was disappointed with the movie. So much more could have been done. Boring, long and dull. Would not recommend this movie."
3,Books are definitely more interesting than the movie is,"I loved reading these books so I thought I will give it a chance based on my experience with Twilight and Harry Potter movies, but this one does not cut it."
3,"Derivative, but still entertaining","Imagine the plot of Star Wars set in Middle Earth, with the Dragon Riders of Pern substituted for the Jedi and you've got ""Eragon"" in a nutshell. Yes, Eragon rips off these great fantasy classics big-time. Yes, many fans of the book think this film is more abomination than adaptation. But if all you're looking for is an entertaining way to spend a couple hours, Eragon should fit the bill. Good special effects and engaging performances make up for some of the plagiarism, and the result is at least fairly diverting.The performances are pretty good, though the characters are fantasy genre cliches (by the way, I DARE you not to laugh when John Malkovich says ""I suffer without my stone""). The character of Arya, however, seems miscast, and looks to be about 10 years older than Eragon, her potential love interest.A pleasant bit of sword-and-sorcery fluff, ""Eragon"" rates three stars."
1,What Happened?,"Many people have already said this but I will say it again, this movie is a cheap remake of a book that deserved the Peter Jackson style of dedication to the story line. Eragon is a great story and has so many opportunities at being a great motion picture trilogy, this just halted the trilogy at one. If you liked this movie don't read the books because they are very different and far better. I really understand when they can't put every detail from the book into the movie but in this translation the story was changed so much that I was lost and did not even know where the story was going to end and I have read the book at least 3 times. Terrible movie and it lacked the effort that a book of this quality deserved. I would plainly not recommend this movie to anyone, just go and buy the book its great."
3,typical fantasy movie,"This movie followed the typical fantasy genre. A young unlikely hero goes aganst unbelievable odds and wins. The special effects were grand and Saphira (the dragon) was as I imagined dragons. The special relationship between Eragon and Saphira was a nice twist on story. Overall worth the money. For all the people who have read the books, the movie deviates from the story line quite a bit"
1,crap..enough said,"while its true that you cant adequately transfer a book to a movie, the makers of harry potter,iron man(i know its not a book but it still held true to the story line), etc have done it quite well. this movie absolutely butchered the books and the script would've been better suited for toilet paper. elves looked like the other humans, the herbalist looked like will smith from wild wild west scene, every thing just SUCKED!!"
1,A monkey with chicken wings...,"Just saw Eragon... and sincerely it proves that to make something ""to sell"" you dont need to make anything new.Eragon is just a piece of trash made with elements from Dragonlance D&D; world + Star Wars + Lord of the rings.We start with the dragon, saphira, i would call ""winged monkey"". Man, there are TONS of AWESOME dragons styles around (especially Dragonlance D&D; world), but what they do: a monkey with chicken wings (no scales, only fur).Them we have master yoda/obi-wan Brom and luke skywalker Eragon.... ""you not ready, you may not use the force""... ops... magic. Also uncle owen death.Dont forget the Legolas in the bad specter fortress...Beside... where are the elves, the dwarf or better, WHERE IS THE VALDAN (if it so written) Fortress??Waste of money, and i hope it wont turn down the hype of the upcomming dragonlance movie."
1,Over The Top...And Still Sub-Par.,"I was completely unprepared for just how bad this movie was. I believe it is the first time a movie has made me want to NOT read the book. If the dialogue was taken ver batim from the book then woe betide the poor reader who has to wallow through such grisly tripe.As for the story line....think of every fantasy you've ever read....now put it in a blender and hit puree. The story is a cliche even of itself.Let's cover the acting...ok on second thought let's not...except to say that Malchovich hit the melodramatic ""high C"".Finally my children both fell asleep watching this movie, and they were the one's responsible for putting it in the DVD player to begin with. I shan't forgive them anytime soon."
1,Zero Stars for this movie; Four Stars for the Dragon Animation,"I'll give the CGI team Four Stars for the Dragon Effects, especially the flight scenes through the river valley and the final aerial battle at the end, but the movie and story are the worst. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are seminal stories which succeed as tales because they stand as archetypes; so both stories are nothing new (Star Wars and LOTR), just retold Jungian/Campbell tales done in a superb, fresh manner. Thus you might argue what's the difference if Eragon does the same thing? Star Wars and LOTR are STILL AROUND! With parallels in Eragon SO CLOSE to these two stories and films, I really can't believe there's no intellectual copyright infringement lawsuit pending...bottom line: the movie is boring: I literally pressed fastforward from 56 minutes to the end and the aerial battle."
2,Not what I was looking for,"The book Eragon is one of my favorites, and I was expecting a very good movie. I was dissapointed when I saw it, though. In comparison to the book, the characters were badly done, and the plot was way off. If you haven't read the book, this may very well be a good movie. But if you have read it, I strongly suggest skipping it.... you will not be very happy if you do see it. The plot was so far off, I'm not sure they will be able to get a second movie out because there will be no way to continue along with Eldest with everything they changed."
1,No stars actually,There wasn't one original idea in the entire film -- just 103 minutes of brain-freezing tedium.
1,What a disaster!,I don't know who directed this movie and came up with the plot but they must not have read the book. I can't believe the author let so much cutting and rewritting happen! If you read the book don't bother with the movie. It should have been called something else.
1,Disapointed,"I felt so very sad when i saw this movie. I loved the books, and the movie ruined the whole spirit of the book, the spesial relationship between Eragon and Saphira, and that was totaly wrong in the movie. He said to her "" I am the dragonrider and you are the dragon, and we do what I tell you"" like she is his slave. 3 part stupid, 1 part lucky, is 4 part annoying and booring, and it seemed to me like he was more 4 part stupid. He was way to lucky, i keept hoping he would die, so he at least had to suffer the consiquenses of his actoins, but noo, he keept living and learnd nothing. That movie was a shame, because the books are so much better. There he has to suffer the consiquenses of his bad choises."
1,This movie doesn't even deserve a star.,"This movie was horrible. If anybody bought this movie, shame on you. You've wasted like $10-20 on a crap movie that has nothing to do with the book. I agree w/ the past writer. They slaughtered it. All the parts were played by wrong people. I bet Chris wasn't even told what the script was. They just took some retard and gave him the book to read. He threw it away and used SparkNotes or something. Horrible movie. It sucked."
1,"From a long time fame - ""A Waste of Money""","first off, TMBG is one of two groups where I would buy their album having not heard a single song (them and Pink Floyd).Simply, I would never do that again with a TMBG album.to qualify myself further, i own all of their studio albums and have seen them live several times.aside from the fact that it was short, which wouldn't be a complaint if the album was good, there was NOTHING on this album that was fun, funny or original. No catchy songs, No energy.I'll give it several more attempts, but it has yet to grow on me. nNeedless to say, i don't plan on buying another TMBG album without listening to it first."
4,Gonna make you fall in love again.,"This was TMBG's 2004 release. It's pretty much what you expect from a TMBG album. Short songs with catchy melodies and absurd lyrics. While it may not rank up there with their best albums, it's still a solid effort. ""Thunderbird"" is my personal favorite song on the album (not that you asked). Not likely to win the Johns many new fans, but most of their regular fan base should enjoy it (although there are some curmudgeonly older fans who seem to hate anything new that TMBG puts out)."
4,Great kids movie but for growups too!,My son loved this movie as a small child. I really liked it too. I purchased this copy for my friends 5 year old who loved it as well. Great family movie for all ages.
3,"Great show, but disapointed in the high price (and getting higher)",Purchased this for $62 off amazon.com It is currently out of print so the price is skyrocketing. I love the show - but it came at a high price
4,Chevy RH Mirror,"Mirror was shipped without the fastening nuts and washers, but other than that, was a good product. Fit was good and installation was about an hour. Price is best you can get for a OEM mirror (although made in China)."
1,Try a Different Brand,"I was really excited to get my Halex Lasso Golf set. I had played it at a company party and had a lot of fun. Unfortunately, this item by Halex is of VERY POOR QUALITY. The plastic fittings hardly fit together without some muscle, and once put together the threads on the T connectors were shot. I cracked two tee connectors just trying to fit the poles into the slots. I also scratched my hand when the top pole slipped out of the connector while working on assembling the other side.You certainly wouldn't take these stands apart to put the pieces in the bag that accompanies the set. First, it would never go back together. Second, the party would be over by the time you were done.I would try Sportcraft or another brand."
1,Save Your Money,This is a fun game but the Halex is junk it did not make it through one day of play. I returned it for a refund and made my own out of PVC.
3,Flimsy,"Easy set up, but disappointed with the quality of the product. The plastic is very flimsy. I had to hammer in the center poles a few times because they would fall off if the lasso hit them too hard. I wouldn't buy this brand again. We like playing, but during every other game, we have to put it together again..."
1,good price bad deal,I had played this game at a family members home before and enjoyed it. I saw this set for sale hear and ordered it. Upon assembling at next cookout some of the poles had some trouble properly fitting into joints. Once assembled it seemed fine. Once we started playing thats when things went south. The upper arms kept falling down when it was lassoed. We spent more time putting this back together than actually playing. This was poor craftsmanship. No bargain at all and I'm very disappointed Amazon would sell an inferior product like this. One use is all I got from this. I see I'm not the only one who feels this way.
5,Panda Licorice,"Panda is an excellent licorice for those who like pure, real licorice. It is a semi-soft bar and is made of natural ingredients. It is nothing like the common, artificially flavored supermarket brands. Panda is natural and has a wonderful, mild flavor. Delicious."
5,For Dogs and Kids,"Both my kids, their friend, and my dogs like this DVD. Entertainment all around. Anything to keep them calm in the house and while on a trip. Well worth the price believe me."
1,Buyer Beware,"Never received this product. It was ordered 10 days before Christmas and yesterday (Jan 17, 2007)I was told that my shipping address was incorrect. I received other items from the same order, so I am not sure why the address would not be correct, but I will not use Amazon as a source for the future. I was very disappointed at their service and they offer no compensation for keeping you as a customer. Not only did I waste time placing and tracking the order, but then I had to go out and shop for gifts to replace these!!"
4,Kraft Fat Free Ceasar Italian Salad Dressing,"I wanted to find a fat free dressing different from the previous one I had ordered and I came across this one and decided to give it a try. It is great!! Nice blend of herbs and spices, full of flavor, but still fat free!"
3,Pure Fun----Ben N. At The Games,a short game that well is fun fun fun fun and thats how it should be its spiderman while this game may be short and does seem to grow a bit boring it still gives you the spirit 3 stars is for this game for being fun its that simple so thats explained over with and done decent game
5,MY spidey sense tells me you should buy this game,This Is a great game for any spiderman fan. It has the same basic storyline as the movie but of course it is changed a bit so there are more levels. To get new combos you have to find yellow spiders that are usually hidden. ( Just a tip on the showdown with Vulture level. Don't get the combo on top of the building until it stops lightning. Trust me YOU Will get struck by lightning).This game is worth adding to your collection but you can beat it very quickly. Don't worry there are a lot of cheat coads and stuff to make it last. I've had it for two years and there are still things I haven't done yet.
3,"Good game, but...","I bought this game as soon as it came out, I couldn't wait. I had about two days of fun with this game. It has great gameplay and graphics, but it was so easy to beat, I returned it after 2 days. There is hardly any other gameplay left once you beat the game. It is a really smoothe game, and is great for younger kids, but if you are a bit older then you would be better off with a different game."
5,The Best Spidy game yet,"The game goes well beyond all the other games.You can use old moves from the games on playstation,dreamcast etc. and has all new moves.Like fighting in the air.Goes beyond the movie which was an awesome movie,one of my favorites ever."
3,Pretty good,spider man is a pretty good game. The camera lock [is weak] though. I guy is punching you and you press camera lock you lock on to a guy 14 steps away from you. It [stinks] how there barely any scenes from the movie. The Graphics aren't as good as i thought they would be. The movie graphics rule though. Its anoyes me how short it is though and how mary jane looks like a pig in some scenes and its also lookes [stupid] when norman turns into goblin. The controls are pretty good though. Itd pretty stupid how the thugs keep on reapeting themselves. Overall its a pretty good game that you should think before buying. buy. The cool things are the fighting combos and how you reply to the thugs. Its cool how the green goblin is stronger then everyone including you. If you want my advice save up for another game
4,If You Have A Guide,"If You Have A Guide...This game is awesome.Overall gameplay is pure fun and exciting.The bosses,thugs,cheats,bonuses,etc...are made to keep you coming back for more!!!And they did a good job at it.Pro's definitely out way the con's.Tons of combat controls,bonus fights,and animated movies.Con's are limited,like sometimesslow camera views,slow to react when heavy fire occurs,but that'sall I can think of right now.You can beat levels at four different difficulties,but in order to complete them (unless your a genius) you will need a game guide for complete gameplay and satisfaction.If you have a guide or are willing to buy one,this game should exceed your expectations and the price.You definitely will get your money out of it."
2,I love the comics; I love the movie; I don't love the game,"The game is fairly short and easy. That would have been okay if not for the horrible camera. When fighting the Green Goblin I found myself constantly fiddling with the shoulder buttons and analog sticks in order to get a decent camera angle. Also, there were not enough bad guys to populate the large environments. Its not much fun when a building or train station contains only two or three guys to fight. If you're a big spidey fan, consider renting it. Don't buy it. You'd be better off spending 20$ on a PSone Spidey game."
5,THE BEST GAME EVER,"This game is AUSOME! It has web slinging,zip lining and you can even get combo attack tokens. This game even has it's own training mode (basic,intermediate,advanced). Also the graphics are ausome,if you put on a big screen it will look in your face 3D (it's already 3D).So if you ask me you should get this game."
3,Outdated,I was looking for the perfect gift fro my brother in law and I thought I had found it. He loves thrift store shopping and this would of been perfect except it was outdated and the cover was bent. I gave it to him anyways and supplemented with a bottle of wine.
2,almost every1 in this movie were players in their own way going out clubbin,this was good directial 4 ice cube what is also good about this movie it is different it focuses more a woman who is trying to make a living for herself by working in the club 2 get her into college while trying to do well in high school but has to watch her street smart female cousin plays with men minds of sleeping with them and taking all their money but later after she gets raped she da cousin turns her life around by working at a shoe store and having to get a taste of our own medicine of being treated badly by two loud mouth ladies toward da end of da film
3,"Not bad, but not great either. Watch it for the girlfight.","I love Ice Cube! He is so hot, even during his NWA days. This movie was okay. It has an unrealistic story of a young and very attractive woman who becomes a teen mom, leaves home and supports herself as a stripper. She attends college and falls asleep in class, yet unbelievably manages to graduate and become, as the ending implies, a reputable journalist.There is a very graphic and disturbing rape scene that makes me cringe just thinking about it.The best part of the movie was the wicked girl fight! It makes me wish that I could kick my ex-boyfriend's a$$ like that!"
5,This Barney Christmas is better than the newer version!,"We misplaced this 1990 version of ""Waiting for Santa"" and recently found it, my 2 1/2 Year old son loves it as much as his sister did 10 years ago.. It has the original kid's cast in it and plenty of music and dancing.. The children travel with barney to the North Pole and visit Mrs. Claus and pretend to be elves, They see santa's list on his computer and the map that Mrs.Santa tracks him on.. A must have Barney video for your child's collection.."

1,Bose; the biggest con-job in audio history,"Proof positive of the power of advertising, Bose has made a name (and money) for itself by designing mediocre quality audio equipment.Unlike AKG or Sennheiser and other high-end manufacturers, Bose uses cheaper parts and less than average electrical engineering principals. These are highlighted especially in their speakers. Their principle of direct-reflection, while novel in 1969 is now incredibally antiquated and is far surpassed by high and mid-end manufacturers whose products outperform Bose. The company was so humiliated by Consumer Reports who compared Bose with other products that it sued (and lost).Someone once said ""There's a sucker born every minute"". Now that's appropriate."
2,Good headphones -- bad headband,"I use headphones nearly all day, and I was excited to get these, my first ""real"" headphones.Now...I don't know nothin' about no sound quality. They sounded good to me, and quieted ambient noise when on my ears, even with no sound playing.But the headpiece connecting the two headphones has cracked in FOUR different places (and flown apart in three) in about four months. One crack appeared smack in the middle of the left headband, nowhere near a stress point--the rest of the breaks happened at the tops and bottoms of the headband. On my headphones, you can now see more duct tape than original headband due to all the various repairs.If you need to use your headphones more than occassionally, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Overpriced and Over-Rated,"I was very unhappy with these. For the price I paid for them, I expected them to feel sturdier. The double cord is very annoying. The ear pieces are angled and quite far from your ears so they sound very muffled and the bass sounds unnatural. I took them back. You can get much better headphones in the same price range."
5,"Delightfully weird, FOX's best animated comedy since ""Futurama""","Sure, it took a few episodes to hit its stride, but ""Bob's Burgers"" quickly became my favorite show in FOX's ""Animation Domination"" line-up. I've been waiting forever for the first season to come out on DVD (and hopefully Blu-ray) and this one looks like a winner, packed with extras with commentary on every episode. Get it! Get it! GET IT!"
2,My 12 month old figured them out in :60 seconds...,"Given the fact that I spent 3 hours installing these things (using extreme care to ensure they are installed correctly)... and my 12-month-old daughter learned how to open the cabinets despite these ""ultra secure"" latches, I tend to question just how good a product they are. Either my child is a genius, or the latches aren't ""ultra secure"" as advertised; I'll leave that decision to the reader.They barely get 2 stars, as they do offer a bit of deterrence; the latches and strike plates also do make a bit of sound when opened as well."
5,Vandoren!,"I've yet to get a Vandoren product that wasn't any good, this cork grease is no different. Vandoren all the way!"
5,Celtic trinity bracelet,This bracelet is extremely sturdy and beautiful. It was heavyweight and about one inch in width. We were very pleased with the quality and beauty of this bracelet.
3,Bendable,This item is very nice but because of my wrist being so small the bending of it all the time caused it to break. So if you have a tiny wrist I wouldnt buy.
2,Mangled version of the story,"This is a Disney book, but they really change (for the worse) the story line compared to the movie. Instead of collecting the dogs for fur coats, Cruella is getting them to sell to the circus. There are several other changes to the story. Most for the worse.Buy some other 101 dalmatians book."
5,EXCELENT,ES JUSTO LO QUE ESPERABA. EL TAMAÑO Y LA TELA SON TAL CUAL SE VEN EN LA IMAGEN. ESTOY MUY SATISFECHA.
4,Good,This is an amazing book. You must search very hard to find the meaning of what the point really is but i love it.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Since there aren't many books out there on Painter, I grabbed this book as soon as I saw it figuring that the Illustrator and Photoshop information would be a bonus. What a disappointment - the very day I received the book I resold it on Amazon. The book's title ""Side by Side"" describes exactly what you can expect to find inside this book - a comparison of the three programs. I can't see where having this book would be useful since it really doesn't describe techniques or provide useful information, or do anything more than cite differences between the programs, which any user would already be aware of anyways. Rather than waste your money on this useless book, I'd recommend the WOW books and/or Kelby's photoshop books - they're packed full of useful information. This book gets one star for the pretty pictures."
2,It worked great . . . for a while,This is a great controller but its a piece of crap. I bought one and after using it for like 3 hrs. it began to became hard to reel and squeked all the time. Hopefully I'll be able to return it. Maybe you'll have better luck than me.
2,RLO_N_TEX,Don't expect a whole lot from this game. It is a very basic shooter - something you would look for in a less advanced gaming system than a PS2. A mediocre game at best due to poor graphics and limited gameplay compared to todays standards. It is ok if you like the retro style of gameplay.
4,No ordinary cookbok,"I've been wanting to practice European cooking for sometime, so I decided to start with Europe's first family, the Basques. This is a continent that takes pride in its sophisticated culinary tastes, and this cookbook shows that the Basques are no exception. The section on wild mushrooms alone demonstrates the refinement of Basque cuisine. The recipes are excellent (although they can be quite difficult), but I was most impressed by the author's prose apart from the recipes. This is one of the few cookbooks I've read that qualifies as good literature, and it deserves to be reviewed and appreciated as such. Moments of lyrical excellence shine through even in translation, and Sevilla should be commmended for crafting such a unique work. Its almost an anthropological study, but in the new style that shies away from dry exposition in favor of a more personal engagement. I recommend this book to cooks and readers alike."
5,this controller rules,the dreamcast controller is the best controller! playstations controller is bad because they tried to shove to many buttons on such a tiny controller. i also dont like nintendos controller because its way to big. dreamcasts graphics are da bomb and lots of people think the start button is in awkward position NO WAY because when you press the start button your always either pausing or quiting your game. peace
1,eh,"everyone is saying how great the author's commentary is, but, eh. it's not that hilarious, nor is it unique, nor is it anything that i would pay money for. it's a blog entry at best (which it originally was)."
2,Don't let children read this book!,"Although this book was hilariously funny, I could not recommend it due to the author's shocking and unpleasant insertions of ridiculously foul language in a book that should have been light humor. I was really enjoying the book until I started running into f___ and s___ and other language that was even worse! Even more mysterious, the bad language was completely unnecessary and even took away from the humor of the material. I am a loss to understand what was going through the mind of the author when she decided that such foul, shocking language was appropriate in a book that otherwise could have been a great book for kids. I really liked the premise for the book and I hope someone writes one that can be a fun, family book, but this is not it."
1,Stupid,"I think this is the dumbest book. I thought it was a recipe book but all it is, sarcastic statements about recipes. Don't buy."
5,Wonderful barn building book,This book is excellent. It covers everything from the simple run-in shed to a full show facility and everything in between. While planning my ideal facility I have used in as a wonderful resource over and over again. This is a must if you would like to build a new facility or remodel your current one.
4,Cool Toy!,"When you use the credit card for this register, it sounds like it's checking your credit. And the money that's included looks like real money and it tells you what denomination is being inserted into the coin bank when inserted. The only problem I've found thus far is that the batteries don't last very long."
2,Didn't work for us!,"I guess it is hit or miss with this toy. Ours would not do anything. The display screen said ""CB OPEN"". We checked the coin bank door and rechecked it, it is firmly shut. None of the buttons will work except the open button. Returned it. Looks like it would have been lots of fun if it had worked."
4,Impressed,I was just looking for a cash register to play store with for my 4yr old son and in addition this register has all kinds of math games on it and he is actually learning with it. All the money is proportinate to real currency so he can associate the play money with real money. The only thing I don't like about it is that when you open the drawer all the coins fly out on the floor.
3,Poor Packaging,"I just received this toy as a Christmas present for my children. I haven't used it yet, so I can't review the toy itself yet. But, I wanted to comment on the packaging.The toy was shipped in it's original box, which came very dented, dinged, ripped, and covered in stickers. My kids saw it sitting on the front porch and immediately knew what it was (we played some trick on them). I will have to take this out of the box to set up for Christmas, as the box is completely inadequate. If I were buying this as a gift for someone else I would not be very happy.Also, the packaging inside the box is not sufficient to protect the cash register for that kind of shipment. No air bubbles, peanuts, wrap, anything like that. Just banged up box, and plastic register.It still may be a good toy, but beware if you are buying as a gift for someone else!"
3,fun,"my daughters still use this and it still works, so a good learning product for the price. i would reccomend it to others."
2,Didn't work,"We love what this toy can do, but the electronics didn't work at all. Hard to explain sending back a toy that Santa brought. Very disappointing."
5,great learning tool,"We really loved it as did the kids. Only problem for us, and it is a problem specific to our environment and hard on all electronic tools we use, we were using it in a therapeutic riding environment which means sandy etc. Hard on the tools/toys here. But it lasted a good year out here!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I ordered this almost four weeks ago for my four year-old. She opened it this morning for Christmas and is very disappointed because it does not work properly. The cash drawer seems to think that it is open all the time and will not perform any of the other functions/games unless you hold it closed. Also, a small metal piece was found inside the cash drawer.Upon logging onto amazon to return it for a new one, they will not exchange it, only offer me amazon credit. It is still available through another seller for much more than I paid for it. Not sure what I'm going to do as I'm sure the price will drop/availability increase in a few weeks, but that's hard to explain to my four year-old.So yes, I know this is only partially a review of the actual item, but I will think again before ordering electronics from amazon during the Christmas season again. I would have been better off if I had gone to an actual store."
5,Awesome learning toy,"This item was a great learning toy, yet lots of fun for the kids. It really helps identify the coin. It tells you how much change you need to return, which makes the kids add the coins. The scanner just simply scans the item and places a random price on it. No bar codes or anything needed. The family really enjoys the product."
1,Doesn't work,"We have had to send this back twice to get a working version and the latest one lasted for two days before dying on us. I thought our first one was just a lemon but now after having two bad ones, we can safely say that a cash register toy this expensive should not be so useless so fast after purchase. Very very disappointing."
2,Problems,I purchased this for my 6 year old son about 2 years ago. It was improperly teaching him the coins by confusing a nickel and a quarter. It took me a while but the company allowed me to ship it back for a new one. We had a friend over and the friend knocked it off a shelf (about 2 feet from the ground) and it broke. All of the lights are lit up and it won't do anything. It's a hassle to ship it to the company to keep having it replaced. And I have to pay the shipping. It's unfortunate because it was a great toy when it did work.
2,Not for children under 6,"Frustrated with this product. The age recommendation says for 3 and up. My 3 year old can't run it. She gets frustrated and just doesn't play with it. My 5 year old does a little better with it but not great. To me it is not intuitive. I think it could have been built with a little more simplicity so children of the recommended age could actually figure it out.Also, ours is broken. Sure it has been dropped off the bed but with a recommended age of 3, that should be expected. The reset button does not reset it anymore. Will be sending it back for a replacement or refund.For the price of this product, I would not recommend."
4,Great teaching tool!,"My 5 year old received this for Christmas, and it was a huge hit. It has been beat up a little by my 3 year old, but always turns back on, and continues to work great. The plastic coins are a little too light, and fly all over when the drawer opens. But we just decided to use real coins, as they would be better for learning anyways!"
2,Sybex Doesn't Care,"The book is as heavy as a Manhattan telephone book (too heavy to carry around), but is packed with useful information. I had planned on printing one chapter at a time and studying it on the subway and bus on my way to and from work. However, I found that Sybex has other thoughts. According to Yvonne in Technical Support, ""Sybex policy prevents us from allowing the contents of our books to be copied or printed from the CD. The files have been secured to protect the copyrights of the author."" It is impossible to print anything from the CD that comes with the book. Thanks a lot Sybex! The value of your book just took a steep nosedive in my opinion."
3,Not enough detail.,"This was an excellent book for a beginner and was an excellent introduction to Win2k Pro, but there wasn't enough detail. I made the mistake of using this as my primary reference and failed the 70-210 test. There were many questions on the test that were not covered in this book. I would recommend using more than one source. I would also recommend that Sybex fire their editor. There were dozens of grammar mistakes. Overall I would recommend this book as an introduction to Win2k Pro, but I would definitely supplement your studies with other book like Exam Cram."
5,Excellent coverage. Surpassed my expectations.,"The previous Sybex MCSE study guides (for NT 4) were very good. I would have given them four stars. The books of the Win2K series which I've read so far, however, are even more clear, accurate, and contain extensive hands-on exercises. Better than before. The CDs include avi files of nearly all of the exercises from the books, and a test engine with a variety of formats, as well as simulations. The Professional book was very helpful for the exam. I haven't taken the Directory Services exam yet, but the DS book is extremely well-written. Hopefully it maps well to the exam. The DS book seemed a bit thin for the price, although I guess the CD contents made up for it. But, nevertheless, I would say EXCELLENT."
1,PROBLEM WITH READER,"I purchased a story reader for my daughter recently and it would only work with the books included with the reader, which were Sponge Bob and Dora. Both books and both cartridges worked beautifully, but additional books I purchased for the reader would not (Lady and the Tramp, Peter Pan, Little Mermaid.) I took the reader and books back to Toys R Us and a very competent sales clerk, a manager, and I tried other readers and books. Sadly, all of the readers were having the same problem, they would only read the books included with the reader. I am assuming this is a problem with new readers only and that the glitch will be worked out following many Christmas returns, however I am sad to not have the gift for my daughter now. Just wanted to warn others to try theirs before gifting them!"
2,"Close, but no cigar.","This book was boring in the beginning. However, when I reached chap.3 I was like DRAGONWINGS!!!! WHOO HOO!! Then the rest went downhill. I suppose, it's because I am not used to the plot of the story (hey, I wasn't around then, and i'm not chinese). On the author's part, I'd like to pat him on the back, this was a great piece of literature, however it lost my attention. For the adverage american, try it you might be inspired, or totally confused. However, I'm the confusing reviewer american so it was close but no cigar."
3,"Strange mold, but cheap.","This mold was supposed to be used to make chocolate truffles, but it seemed only fit to make peppermint paddies. If you want flat discs of chocolate that are like a silver-dollar-pancake, this is for you."
1,Fallin' Ex - Jehovah's Witness,"Again, another angry, bitter apsotate.Oh well... all I can say is PBS is having a documentary out in the Fall called, ""Knocking"" and it is done by a son of a Jehovah's Witness and he is not a Witness but wanted to portray what his Mom goes through in life and what the Jehovah's Witnesses have accomplished through out history. It is an unbiased look at the religion.Look out for it coming this Fall..."
2,go with the tremor pack,"If you're looking for a rumbling accesory, Interact's Tremor Pack is the way to go. At half the price of Sega's pack, it also rumbles very strongly, and IGN ranked it best out of the three available rumbling accesories."
5,Great Collection,"Now how can you go wrong with a CD that gives you ""The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore"" by the Walker Brothers? What a great rendition of a great song.Like most compilations, you'll get some songs that probably won't overwhelm your interest (Peter Rabbit?), but overall it's a wonderful collection. The Righteous Brothers, The Walker Brothers...and fused well with other era songs. You even get ""Fire"" from the Crazy World of Arthur Brown.A very enjoyable CD."
5,A fantastic 60's tunes compilation,"There are couple of clunkers in the mix (""Peter Rabbit"" and ""You Wouldn't Listen"") but otherwise ""Classic Oldies 1965-1969"" is a superb collection. I have not heard the slow dance tune ""Things I'd Like to Say"" since 1969 and this is a clean original stereo rendition. For me it was worth the price of the entire CD, so the other great songs (e.g., ""Soul and Inspiration,"" ""Israelites,"" and ""Society's Child"") are a bonus."
3,"Specifics good, examples better","I would have wanted to know more about the country, religion, and traditions of the country before I had purchased the book. Share more about the characters and less about the action in the write up. Don't use vocabulary words people have to look up.Other than these items, it was an ok read but I would have wanted more details about the book before I purchased it."
2,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This Movie seems cool, but its a waste of money and time. The cover art draws you in and makes you think yeah this going to be a kick ass movie. But its NOT. The plot is good. But not a lot of action and the action moves seem simple and not so entertaining. There was more talking than action and that threw me off big time. So don't waste your time!"
2,The Prankster's Ultimate Handbook,"I expected the book to be full of light-hearted, good-natured practical jokes. Not so. Some of the jokes involve video cameras in bathrooms and other ""jokes"" are simply mean. A few are funny, but overall, this book was a big disappointment."
3,This is a good book,"I like this book much. Some of the prank are old and or too mean for some people, but for entertainment purposes it is very humorous. This book is not as large as I expected and contains a smaller number of pranks as I expected, but it still is pretty good."
5,Great system!,this is one of the best systems i have and i have a xbox360 a wii a NES a sega genesis and a gamecube ya thats 6 systems and it is one of the best by far and if you Get this system make sure to get resident evil code veronica that is one of the best games! Hope this helps you!P.S. it is worth the money.
1,Don't by a DreamCast,"Sega has just annouced that they will stop production of Dreamcast. They have 200,000 to sell, but you will be stuck with an obsolete system"
5,Great System,This machine is worth buying for the game Soul Calibur alone. Having a perfect translation of the arcade game House of the Dead 2 doesn't hurt either. This is the best video game console and will be for a long time.
1,One word: Failure (so far!),"SEGA just don't get it... It is the Gameplay which counts more, not the graphics and the powerful engines... The dreamcast is undoubtedly a very powerful machine, but I played few games and I thought it was a disappointement... I had all of my expectations in Sonic the Hedgehog, and it didn't turn out the game I expected it to be. Games like Incoming are even worse, it is boaring, even the graphics are so-so... It is with regret that I inform you that it was a disappointement. I checked most of the games which are present in the market right now, and so far, 1 star is all I could manage to rate. The only good side though is that it has potential; I am expecting ""good"" games to be launched in the near future, that's because the engines are powerful. I hope those guys in SEGA go on to plan B, so my purchase of the Dreamcast wouldn't be a waste!"
1,you don't know anything do you!,"Playstation 2 is ALOT better then dreamcast. Its a big deal to sign up with dreamcast online. Dreamcast is dial-up KID! Sure Dreamcast was the best system back then but now its all over. Dreamcast is slower then PS2 XBOX and lastly gamecube. Your trying to embarase yourself, how sad. I don't know why its rated higher then Xbox. Dreamcast game libary was so small, thats why it went out of busnius. PS2 has both broadband and dial-up, it was made by Sony which is one of the best companys. Dreamcast is not tied with ither XBOX PS2 GAMECUBE. You can purchace a LCD screen for XBOX GAMECUBE PS2!"
3,Dreamcast? It's the next Saturn.,"The Sega Dreamcast certainly has the best graphics of any home console currently on the market. But they are not very much better than a Nintendo 64 or a good PC. After renting the unit, i am very dissapointed in the bug-riddled Sonic game and the cheap, uncomfortable controller. With Sega's track record and rocky future, I would not spend $200 on a system that will probably be dead in six months."
3,get a DC now.........,"its cost-effective and there are good games out for it. but in about 6 months or so when the ps2 has some more time to get the ""good games"" in stores, and when the x-box and gamecube hit stores in the near future, sega wont have a leg to stand on. just look at the sega cd, the sega 32x, the sega saturn, the sega genesis. do you see a pattern forming here?"
5,"Dreamcast: ""Wave of the Future!""","The Sega Dreamcast is the best system on the market today. This system can go on-line, play very graphic games, play music cds, and take you to the edge of your seat. With the 56k modem this system is like a PC and DC console! Surf the web with the web brouser cd that comes along with the purchase of a Sega Dreamcast.Don't throw away money for a PS2 in October, take my advice, buy a Dreamcast. Play the great graphic games that Sega has released for this system. The 3D graphics are great! When your playing a Sega Sports game, it's like watching it on TV! Realistic graphics are a plus for the Dreamcast. You can even play your favorite music cds on the great new ""Wave of the Furture""! ... The Sega Dreamcast is the best system you should spend your hard-earned money on, you deserve it, theres even talk about the Sgea Dreamcast lowering its price, so buy the Dreamcast! It's only the best system you'll ever own in your life!"
3,"Good hardware, mediocre games","The system has great graphical capability. Unfortunately, most the games that are out there--with the exception of a few titles, namely ""Soul Calibur""--are of mediocre quality. I've been through about 20 different Dreamcast games and there have only been about 3 or 4 that I liked. The rest were pretty boring.I just wish that better games would be released for this machine. It has so much capability and yet nothing really cool or original is being done with it. It's a pity."
5,I think that Sega Dreamcast would have out longer.,If it wasn't for the dumb stupid overpriced Playstation2 I really hate the playstation2 I can't even find a Dreamcast GameShark because of this Playstation2 System.
5,"THE DREAMCAST IS A PC, CD PLAYER ,WEB SURFING MONSTER!","Let's start with the web browsing capability's and yes it can download!(Mp3,WAV,AIFF,AU ,audio playback ,EMAIL,IRC CHAT,128-bit Encryption,Javascript,Flash,HTML 2,JPG,GIF and PGN graphics!) It is a net surfing monster!Plus Has better V-ram And sound Proccesor's than the ps2! Oh Yah and it's also a 128-bit video game machine!"
2,Sega finally gets it right...but too late,"Sega finally got it right with the Dreamcast despite the Nintendo knock off controllers. This was Sega's last effort in the console wars but we all know how that turned out. By Sega, makes so good games on Nintendo."
3,Out Dated,"I bought the Dreamcast just to get World Series Baseball 2K. I was pleased at first, but then I was disgusted. The game is fun and all, but you're limited to options during gameplay. I ended up buying other games and the graphics are great. However I found it hard to find a good game. I just bought an XBox yesterday and I can't wait for it to come. If you're thinking about buying a Dreamcast, save your money and go with one of the newer systems. GO XBOX!"
3,Dreamcast is ok,"Dreamcast is an ok system, i don't think it is the best. The dreamcast has awsome graphics and some ok games. I think Sega could have done a much better job on some of the games. I think if u buy a ps1 you will have more games to play, and they cost less. Or you could also buy an N64. I don't think dreamcast is worth to buy at this point bacause there going to stop making the system and I don't think there are going to be much more than 70 games coming out fot it. At the snd of this year I think dreamcast will be dead. I think by the end of this year PS2,Gamecube,and Xbox will have most of the macket, I don't think dreamcast will haave much of the market."
3,A diversion? Or will it last?,"The Sega Dreamcast's success in sales as of late is representation of a lack of a new system in three years. And with the media promotion (Something the saturn Majorly lacked), and decent launch-title selection, the Dreamcast is seeing light among consumers. For the time being. We do have to keep in mind what the future holds, that being Playstation's Second version. The dreamcast holds to be an incredible system however, with it's games, such as Sonic Adventure and NFL/NBA2K, showing off the incredible 3-D power we're in store for over the next few years. Is a purchase of the dreamcast worth it? If you want to plunge yourself into some great 3-D gaming right now, yes. But if you want to wait for what could possibly be one of, if not the greatest video game console ever, it might be worth it."
5,Imagine The Power of an Arcade System In a Box,This game system is DA-BOMB. I got it for my birthday from my parents along with the Sonic game. Its graphics are like a computer's graphics only a bit better. I just got Soul Calibur and it rules. There is only one word to describe this System WHOA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great system.... Great Price,"I have a Dreamcast and I love it! The graphics are just as good as Gamecube, PS2, and XBOX. At this price..... it is a steal. It has great games like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Tony Hawk 2, Sega GT, NFL 2K2, and others. If you are looking for a great system at a great price, then get a Sega Dreamcast."
1,The truth is here...,"Here is your daily dose of reality. Dreamcast is a good console, but it is getting ready to bomb. Big time. The word is out, and I think people are starting to realize it, that PS2 will be cheaper, easier to find, and will have better games. That rocks cause I have a PS2 and Dreamcast and I play my PS2 more. I don't want to sell my Dreamcast, even though it won't be worth barely anything(lol.) PS2 will get better, and Dreamcast will get, well, nowhere, cause they don't make enough games anyway. PS2 rules. Ta ta."
4,2nd best,dreamcast is the 2nd best systom only behind xbox next is ps2. Now that dreamcast is out of buisnus games are cheap. If you want a good systom at a low price dreamcast is your answer.Such games like nfl 2k2 and the rest of the 2ks are the best games on the market
5,The ULTIMATE gaming machine,"This has got to be the most amazing video game machine EVER built. This bad boy throws around high end graphics like ragdoll BABY. I personally have a PII450 with a Voodoo3 and a SBLive and I have yet to see anything on my PC that can come close to the visuals of Soul Calibur. People talk about the Playstation 2 and rave about it... well, it's VAPORWARE, Dreamcast is here and it's here to stay... MAN what a dream machine."
3,A Fun Machine,"I am an owner of a Dreamcast,Ps1,Ps2,sega saturn,sega genesis,gamecube,N64,and an Xbox and I love my dreamcast , the graphics on it are alot better than my Ps1 and N64,sega saturn,and genesis but not better than my PS2 and Xbox and just as good as my Gamecube I love the modem its great. the games are great too.This is a great system"
2,Multiplayer not a big factor,"Gee! All you people bashing Playstation2 for only having 2 controller ports while Dreamcast has 4. Well, a well known fact is that 99 percent of the video game market plays 1 or 2 player games. The only reason this is an issue is because that 1 percent is a very vocal group. And cost of the new Playstation won't be 125 smackers more than this dreamcast, because 1. You're working with the current Japanese price and exchange rates and 2. Sony has yet to announce a U.S. price. Say what you must, but if it would hurt you the slightest, wait for PS2. Who needs Internet on a game machine? If you want it so bad, get a PC."
1,Ps2 blew this system out of the water,"I'd just like to say if this system is so good how come Ps2 beat it out of the console race? I give it 1 star for setting the path for online gaming. Sega needs to stop trying to compete with Nintendo and Sony. There are 30 million+ PS2s out there. It should focus more on games for the Ps2, then Sega will have finally done something right."
3,Dreamcast is a cool console even though it is dying.,"The Dreamcast is an awesome console. It has cool grahics, great game, a responive yet ugly looking controllor, and a build-in 56K modem. Even though it has nice games most of its games can be found on the Gamecube, Xbox and the PS2, so why would you want it now that their on the other systems. But if you simply must have it please do so, I highly recommend it."
3,Price Is Right,"The dreamcast is a truly amazing system, for its time. . . Which was almost 2 years ago! The PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube are all way out of it's league. Especially with the shutdown of DC Hardware units in the spring. But let me tell you this, for the price, DC is a hundred times better than Playstation or N64. The games are way more advanced, much more fun, and most are dirt cheap! And I guarentee the software won't die down anytime within the next 2 years. So if you are looking for a cheap but great machine, this is the way to go!"
3,8 Hours to Set Up!,"It took me 8 hours to figure out that it does not do what it claims. on a non-apple network.It does two things:act as a wireless router, when physically connected to a wanOR acts as a wireless client that ONLY lets you stream music to it (or presumably share a printer)It DOES NOT allow you to attach it to a non-wireless device and use it to connect that device to your wireless network (a bridge). On a non-apple network."
1,"Good Product, But . . . .","Other reviews mention that the directions leave much to be desired. I'll second that analysis, but a methodical approach utilizing the few hard and fast rules within the directions should get a user up and running.The real drawback to the AirPort Express appears to be its potential for early mortality. Please read the discussion at this URL:[...]I purchased four AirPort Express units within sixty days. Two of those four have failed with 16 to 18 months of the purchase date. Apple's warranty covers the product for 12 months. Apple will not admit that this problem exists or offer a solution to AirPort Express owners.I'm a loyal customer of Apple. Over the past twenty years, their customer service has been either excellent or poor with NO mediocre service in the middle. Apple's response to the premature mortality of many AirPort Express units falls into the poor category, and because of that, I won't take my chances with this particular unit in the future."
3,A lil disapointed,"I bought this unit cause i loved the idea of airtoons, wireless printing and wireless hotsync for my sony clie. i use it with my g4 powerbook. it all works easily but with one major glich. when itunes hits a silent point i can faintly hear a radio broadcast through my speakers. if i quit itunes the problem goes away. the unit is hooked up to my tivoli radio two.the most disapointing thing is that i cannot find this problem listed on apple anywhere and therefor have to run a wire to my stereo.without this problem it would be a five star product."
3,Complicated set up for Windows users,"I was having a lot of trouble getting this product to work initially. The directions do not mention this, but I had to ditch my network's WPA2 encryption and go with a 128 bit WEP encryption. I would rather go with WPA2 since it is more secure, but I suppose it's not that big of a deal. I first called Apple tech support and they had me repeating everything I had already done. After about a half hour of that, they finally told me to try disabling my network security. Apple didn't know what kind of security would work, so I had to call D-Link (my router manufacturer). Overall, I like the product now that it is working, but Apple needs to be much more clear on Windows setup with a 3rd party router."
2,Does not work with 3rd party access points,"This is great solution if you currently have no wireless network. But if you are trying to use this to extend your existing wireless network, like it says right on the box, it will not work. Per Apple using a 3rd party access point, i.e. a non-apple airport base station, is not a supported configuration.I am a network engineer and a Cisco CCIE, and I have tried everything, I am very VERY disapointed in this product. I can't believe apple embraces an open OS like BSD under OS-X, and then offers this totally pripritary solution!"
5,Bought it for AirTunes,I bought the Airport Express merely to add to my existing wireless network (using an Airport Extreme Base Station) so I could stream music wirelessly to my home stereo directly through iTunes. It works great - so far there hasn't been even the slightest breakup of sound.
5,Windows Users Heed The Advice From The Star Review.,"The setup wizard software is useless if you're a typical Windows user who already has everything setup and just wish to add this to your network to allow you control your stereo remotely. Go by what was written by the star reviewer and you'll have it up and working in 5 minutes (well, in reality, 30 minutes). And once you get it up and working it's like typical Apple gear...brilliant, if a little expensive for what it is."
2,Did Microsoft really make this thing?,"I bought it to just stream music from a PC via a wifi-g network to the home stereo. Install was a mess. It wouldn't work with any SSID name other than the factory default no matter what. We'd get it up & working, change the SSID and for all it knew, it was at the bottom of the Pacific. It also won't work with the WEP enabled. If you're worried about security & have a Cisco Linksys WRT54G, this is not for you. The MAC address system at least works.Further, the wirelss network crashes every couple weeks now, something it never used to do. I don't know why, so I can't say for sure it's the AirPort's fault, but it never did this prior to its install, and it started doing it right after we put it on.Would I buy it knowing what I know now? No. When it does want to work, it does an okay job. But given what Apple charges, I'm not longer in a hurry to shift to one of their computers."
5,Excellent Product,"This is another excellent Apple product. If you have the money, I would strongly recommend this product over all other wi-fi broadcasting devices."
4,It took a little work,"I had to call Apple tech support a couple of times. The first time, I was trying to connect my MacBook to the AirPort Express. The trick was to reset the base station.The second call to tech support was when I tried to connect my PC to the AirPort Express. The trick was to use the 26-character password for the base station and the name of the base station during the installation of the wireless network card for the PC. You can find the password in the AirPort Admin Utility.I used a D-Link WDA-1320 wireless PC card.I put detailed PC instructions on my Web site: shoyustuff.com"
1,Airport Express buyer beware,Make sure you fully understand wirelss connections if you plan to purchase this product. I intended to use the Airport strictly to stream music to my home stereo via iTunes and was unable to complete the connection successfully. The product may very well do what Apple claims it can but the setup instructions are vague to say the least and the only product support available is an online discussion forum that is total potluck. I recommend checking out the discusion group on the Apple website regarding the lifespan of the product (usually stops working after about one year!).
2,"PC Users..If you want plug n play, then this is not for you","I was really excited about the concept of the Airport Express, however I found it extremely difficult to set-up. I assume its easier with a Mac computer, but my experience with my PC and existing wireless network did not make the process fun. Back to the Apple store...."
2,Not what I expected,"More than half of this book was a historical summary of the ideas of earlier researchers. I felt this material could've been summed up with greater efficiency in fewer pages. Also, the author just doesn't seem to write cohesively; I felt things were meandering and became bored with the text."
2,Fishing game that's too realistic,"This fishing game is great if u have tha patience to wait for a bite only to lose tha fish. It has a decent learning curve time at about a half an hour if you've never played the other ones (Reel Fishing 1 & 2). It is hard to get a bite let alone keep a fish. Yeah I know, in real fishing it's tha same way, but when I bought it, I figured on catching fish easy since it is a game and all. I mean-bottom line-it is too much realistic to the genre (fishing[in leisure,not tournament]) to be any fun."
3,Disappointed,I enjoyed Rosamund and Until You but I didn't like this book at all. When I read this book I did something I've never done before - I skimmed through a Bertrice Small historical romance. I hated Philippa - she was so annoying. Crispen was a huge bore. All of the sections written about life at court put me to sleep. I liked Thomas in the first two books but for some reason he annoyed me in this book. I found it odd that Rosamund would let him control how her daughters would live their lives. Bertrice Small has many great books but this book is one of the worst books she's written.
2,Boring,"Don't get me wrong. I love Bertrice Small's books. And even her worst books are still better than most. However, this book was just plain boring. I would continually flip through the book to find passages about Rosamund and Logan. Now there is hot couple! I wish Ms. Small would have written about about them instead. Logan was always my favorite of Rosamund's loves. Anyway, Philippa is a sad imitation of Rosamund. And the whole ""conspriracy to kill the king"" lasted less than a chapter! Sorry, but Philippa and the entire book was boring."
1,Not for me ...,"In a word: yuck. I made it about 1/4 of the way through this book, hoping to find a glimmer of inspiration to trudge forward. No such luck. Instead, I feel like I need to shower ... fully clothed. I agree with another 1-star commenter who found the book to be ""a turn off."" The horrors of the holocaust are undeniably ghastly, but a sexual encounter between the ghost of an old man with half his head blown to pieces and a young girl (13 or 14, the book says) who is dying of TB? My stomach is still turning. I found nothing ""enlivening"" about this account, certainly nothing beautiful, and I can't bring myself to read further in effort discover the value others found in this book. My one star goes to the crow who embodies the spirit of a dead rabbi. I mean, who doesn't love the idea of a philosophical corvid? But if you want a talking crow AND a better storyline, try Brian Doyle'sMink River."
2,The Truth Was Disturbing Enough,"Magical Fiction about the Holocaust, how will this instruct us when the truth was more unsettling than anything that can be imagined? This novel was well-written, yes, disturbing and painful to read, as any fiction with such subject matter must be, but I found myself wondering why I went on this journey and what the young American author felt he could tell me that survivor fiction and non-fiction had not already. I felt the Holocaust exploited and regretted having read this book. I'm going back to my Primo Levi, my Paul Celan."
5,"Wildly inventive, haunting and magical...","One of the best books I have ever read and perhaps the most effective embodiment of the holocaust in fiction ever accomplished. Combining magic realism, chassidic folktales and narrative inventiveness beyond anything I've read, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. I eagerly await whatever Joseph Skibell comes out with next. For another inventive read, try WAS by Geoff Ryman."
5,A poignant tale of courage and love!!!!!,"This is definitely a keeper. Clay's sooo sweet and sensitive, yet quietly courageous and steadfast in his believes that it made me cry my eyes out reading about his sufferings and secret pain. He is definitely one of my favorite heroes. I couldn't put this book down! And I'm sure it's going to stay in my heart for years and years to come."
5,Well-done and unique,"Lorraine Heath definitely makes her books unique and well done. Always to remember is similar to Sweet Lullaby in that the point of view is mostly through the eyes of a male. A touching story about a man, Clay, who comes back from war and branded a coward because of his choice not to fight. He suffered through the years during and after the war. He comes back, and the townpeople are outraged that he had the nerve to come back when others died fighting for the Cause. One of them is Meg who decides to punish Clay for his cowardness by building a statue for the town. Yet, Meg later turns her hatred into love when she realizes that Clay is a compassionate, caring man.If you have read Lorraine Heath's books, this is one to keep as a collection. It's a great story to warm your heart. If you haven't read her books, you are missing out! All her book are awesome and must have's, especially Texas Splendor(heart-warming and will touch your heart)"
2,Mozart without passion,"What's not to love about Alison Hagley's Susanna? But I have to say that Gerald Finley's Figaro seemed to me rather uninspired. In addition there appeared to be little chemistry between the two lovers. Okay performance, but not great."
2,Terrible,The footage was really old (though the cover looks recent) and the DVD would skip and stop playing in the middle of it.
1,WHY NOT IN CANADA????,"I am in need of a sega dreamcast keyboard, and i cannot find one in any of your stores in canada, or on your website. i am not impressed that you, and sega, have kept this item away from the canadian users. so either get more sent to your stores in canada, or i will stop shopping at your stores! and i am also not impressed with another thing that your store has done....."
3,Don't buy it if you want to be a 'code cruncher'.,"Well, let me tell you, I AM a professional programmer. But, more importantly, I am a less than pleased customer. I refer you to page eight, the end of the first paragraph under the heading 'Learning HTML': ""But please rest assured that in this book we have absolutely no intention of molding you into a code cruncher!"" (exclamation by publisher). Now, I ask you; why else would I buy a book named HTML COMPLETE, a 1000+ page book touted on the back cover to,""contain the essentials you need to know about creating and modifying Web pages with HTML."" So, why three stars and not one? The book's not half bad (note lack of enthusiasm). As long as you can stomach multiple advertisements for Microsoft's FrontPage Express, an ""easy-to-use word processor for creating HTML documents."" So far I've counted four glowing references to this 'alternative' tool, and I'm only on the thirty-fourth page."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I can't remember if I have already written a review of this one or not, so here goes. I love Linda Howard's books. I loved the MacKenzie series until Maris' story in MacKenzie's Magic. It was a let-down. So, along with many others, I eagerly awaited Chance's story. It was also a let-down. Read the other reviews of Chance. I wish Ms. Howard had taken more time to develop Maris and Chance. Imagine the possibilities!"
4,my life in dog years,I thought this book was good for people who love dogs. I love dogs. I would recommend this book to people who do not like dogs and people who like dogs. Because people who does not like dogs could change there minds about dogs.
4,My Life in Dog Years,"This book was given as a gift ... a great gift for any dog lover. Originally I shared this book with a class of 4th graders, but I continue to recommend it for anyone who has or ever had a dog. It made me laugh and cry and it was written in true Gary Paulsen style."
4,The Age of Sicnce,"Gerard Piel's ""The Age of Science"" is an excellent historical overview of some of the major advances in the biological and physical sciences during the 20th century with their roots in the 19th century and earlier. The book does not claim to cover all areas and it doesn't. On the other hand, the section on earth history and the evolution of life, and tools and human evolution yield interesting and valuable perspectives. The major weakness is the book's diagrams which are sometimes hard to read, othertimes difficult to interpret."
5,Recommended Textbook,"This is the textbook I recommend for the school system's curriculum. It contains fewer errors and blatant lies than any of the others I've had to consider for the committee this year. And no, the publisher did not send me any free sports tickets or food."
4,Who said farming had to be boring?,"Well, one would think that playing a farming based game would be boring as hell. Then honestly, that individual has never tried Harvest Moon A Wonderful Life. As someone who missed out on the earlier part of the Harvest Moon series, this was my first experience with a farming-based RPG game. The concept is very simple and requires a bit of care and attention to it. I will not go and talk much about the game since I am sure everyone here has covered it in some sort of fashion but growing a farm as well as raising a family is pretty fun as well as watching over how your son will turn out to be at the end of the game. At times, it can get a bit boring but the outcome of the game makes it all the while to sit down, dedicate a good portion of your time and play it. It is definitely a must have for any Gamecube/Wii owner as well as players of RPG!"
5,Way Better Than Harvest Moon 64,"This is the best Nintendo GC game out there. Seriously. It's So nice to find a game without killing, levels, or bosses.A brief review of the game:Your job is to take on a farm your dad left to you. You also choose a wife out of 3 potential girls, get married, and have a son. Then, the real game begins: You guide your son through his life. You influence him and what career he chooses. On your farm, you can keep cows, sheep and chickens, as well as a horse and goat. You plant crops and grow friendships with the villagers.WARNING: THIS GAME IS VERY ADDICTIVE!"
4,Harvest Moon Review,"Harvest Moon A wonderful life is a great game! It helps you learn how to take care of crops,care for animals, and raise a family! It comes with new obstacles all the time and you have to really use your mind. Its really actually wonderful!"
1,"Not satisfying, and addictive","This game is really bad and hard. You start as a rancher, but making money is very hard, you have to marry raise kids, like in real life, but it's not as it sounds, it's boring,cause you have to do everything all the time. Bottom line Don't buy it, if you haven't played the other ones"
5,The more you play the better it get's!,"Before this game came out I was really excited, I love the 64 one and Friends of Mineral Town is Okay. When my freind got the game I was admittedly a little dissapointed,but two months later a kid at school said it was great. The next day at my friends house I forced myself to play past the first day. The more I played the more I loved it. Infact my freind (who hadn't played the game since she got it) pushed me aside and started playing. Needless to say the next day I got the game. I'm hooked now. The festivles aren't very good but besides thatit's the best. and because things change every year it doesn't become too repetitive which was my one problem with 64. It also has beatiful graghics, like for instance the cows look real! Your son is really cute too! So I definatley recomend this game. It brings harvest moon to a whole new level."
4,A WONDERFUL Life!,"This is a great ROLE PLAYING GAME. I am just a kid, but I love the RPGs like Sims and such. Not only to I reccomend this game, I DOMINATE it! I am the master at this, so here is what you should know:PROS:-You grow up how YOU want in this-Very fun and lots of details-Do quests for your neighbors and start a relationship with 2 of 3 girls.-Get married!!-Raise your own kid!!CONS:None that I know ofI know that you may only be a boy in this game--Sorry girls, I am a girl myself!-but this game is fun either way!"
4,grat job,"hi i know a lot about harvest moon. once i was playing harvest moon64 and i played it til ifell asleep""ha ha"" i love harvest moon ahole lot. and im a girl. iknow the names of the girls you can marry. they are muffy,nammi,andcelia.i got it out of a nintido power magazine.well i hope this hellps you. ..."
3,Kinda Boring,"Amazon delivered item quickly and got it within a week! The animation on this game is pretty good. However, there aren't any games to play during the festivals -- NO Dog race nor horse race nor contests. Dog is useless and only 3 girls to choose for wife. Wife doesn't help around the farm. No greenhouse. seasons are short. Not much to do as a farmer or places to go. Rather BORING. Younger kids may enjoy it better."
4,its really fun and really loooooooooooooonnnnnnnng,"its really fun game but can get long i know 6 people whove owned this game since came out and havent gotten half way through it yet.but you gotta get a wife and have a kid and raise the kid.you have a choice of three wives Nami, the tom boy and hardest to get(but i got her), then theres muffy the prissy bar girl who is the second hardest to get, and theres Celia the farming girl who you can pretty much get her to like you in a couple of days.its a lot of fun raising cows though to you have to milk your cow and feed all your animals. and buy more animals.you can even fish to which you end up eating anyway.overall the graphics are a bit cheesy but youll get used to it (if you want to beat it you better get used to them.the controls are easy and the sounds are a bit cheesy to but thats alright.overall its fun but long."
5,never mind!,Harvest moon whatever SCARED me the first time I played it like..... MASSIVELY big town area unlike Back to Nature but but it's all right cause the town adds more houses as you go along which is BLOODY fun indeed! I like to train my dog to go KILL the local new comers and I'm sure you do too.
3,Back to Nature is better!,"yes I downloaded this one off the internet, a rom like.... it is totally like back to nature in every way just a gameboy version, it's sort of a rip off. Being a Muuh-Dalleion I am happy with this game but being a Michelleion I am NOT!"
5,"it,s great","i like this game but i hadn,t tried the playstaion version i like this version but i hadn,t got a horse there are 4 seasons spring, summer , fall and winter and you can get married to 4 girls and have a son. buy this game"
2,Only get this game if you need your veggies...,"All previous Harvest Moon games have been great, but this is a big exception. There are only two tools that you can use! how helpful is that?? This is dumb."
5,Picky Eater,I grate this over my dogs dry food & she loves it...mostly she eat this food and leaves the dry...
5,Excellent service!!!,Product arrived quickly and in described shape. Excellent seller and will definitely purchase from again!!!
4,Great if you can find it,"Don't hesitate buy it here. I just went out to five major electronic stores and they did not have them. Amazon is the only place that seems to have them.I was told that sega is not making a whole lot of these until Christmas so they can make better sales revenue. Go ahead and try to buy it somewere else, for the next shipment of these vmu's will not be there until december. It is a must have and get two if you have NFL 2k and another game.NFL 2k takes up 191/200 blocks and others take 10-15 blocks. It has got the screen and other do-dads that make this gizmo a must buy for gamers. Shame on SEGA for not making these avalible to retailers.(Not one store that I went to in north california had one of these as of oct 15. so get them and get them now!"
3,"It's cute, but can be better.","OK, I know the amount of blocks or mems is the main problem, but it's good enough for fighting games like Marvel vs. capcom and Soul Calibur. When you playing Soul Calibur with this mem card, you can actually see the cheapy cartoon characters that you are controlling! Well, it's not much, but something fun to look at. I like the design and it works pretty good for me. What's bothering me is that it doesn't have a plastic cap to close/protect the bottom panel when it's not being used. This is important for people switch mem cards very often, because you don't want the connection slots to collect dust!"
1,One of the Worst Movies Imaginable,"With John Waters's name and Aly Sheedy's name I thought that maybe there was a chance for an undiscovered treasure. No way. This has no redeeming qualities - no humor, no irony, no acting, no cinematography. If a group of sixth graders had made this in a junior high film class (a beginning junior high film class), I could understand. This attempt at a campy ""mockumentary"" on the order of ""Spinal Tap"" (I guess)fails on every level. Sometimes a bad movie is so bad it's..... bad."
4,What the Cool Kids Have on their Backpack....,"I bought this for my 1st grader as apparently, the trend right now is to clip-on as many ""adorable"" keychains onto your backpack as possible. These are really cute and of higher quality then most keychains made for this purpose. You might want to buy a couple in case your child loses it though..."
3,"Great shaver, except...","I've had mine for about 1 year, and it is a great shaver, except I'd like to see the lotion come in a bottle or tube that you could apply to your face like other pre-shave lotions. the little cartrages are expensive and last about 1 week. Some stores don't carry them all the time, and if you run out, you have to wait until they come in, or wait for snail-mail to deliver them. Other than that, it works well wet or dry. You have to figure in the yearly cost of the cartrages to see what it will cost you to shave for a year."
5,Perfect Fit,"Purchase this item to install my stereo, couldn't ask for better, fits just perfect to my hyundai dash board.. I very happy with all this products that i had bought. O by the way delivery was on time. Package well protected- and of course item was as describe."
1,Sucks,"First off, I like medabots, but the second season sucked. The first season was waaaaaaaaaaaay better. They should of based it off of the first season. Why did the game suck? Your running around in an arena where some other dude is a crackpot shot while you can't hit anything. Basically, there is no targeting system. Instead, you're running around shooting in some direction shooting about 30 degrees off target. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1,Read this Review BEFORE Purchasing,"I purchased this for my upcoming trip to Asia. Unfortunately, two of the three adapters that are used in China are NOT included in this kit. Also, the converter portion of this is only good for appliances such as blow dryers and curling irons. If you have electronic devices such as laptops, MP3 players, cell phones, you need a step down or up transformer NOT a converter.Today, our chargers are universal and can be used without the transformer. Check your charger to see if it goes to 220 or 240 Volts. If it does you only need the adapter for the country you are visiting."
3,Works,"This item worked well. It was bulky and a little heavier than I would have liked it to be; but still, it has survived several layovers in O'Hare and that's more than I can say for my suitcase!"
1,Up in smoke....and sparks!!!,"Item was purchased for a trip by my daughter to Argentina, SA. On first attempted use the product sparked, smoked and melted. Item was disgarded in Cordoba to save weight on return flight. Packaging states for use in South America as well as other destinations. Roommates product of similar nature worked fine. Cannot recommend."
5,Perfect for International Traveling,"The Powerline By Original Power Travel Kit worked well on a recent trip to Spain and Portugal. It is easy to carry about and worked in all of the hotels, etc. in which we stayed."
2,Thumbs Down Again,"The power travel kit is entirely too heavy. I would not want to include it in my baggage weight. And I probably can't put it in my carry on. Also, the lid does not stay closed, causing the adapters to fall out. I will not be taking it on this trip."
4,"Adventures of the Gummi Bears, Vol. 1 - Seasons 1-3","I used to watch the gummi bears when I was younger and to be able to share a really nice Disney show that I grew up with my kids is great. The fact that you get 3 seasons in a little set is also great. Very good quality picture considering it is from the 80's. I have been waiting for years for Disney to put these out, no fan fair like they give there movie releases but I am happy. Nice hearing my kids singing the theme song."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,The Gummi Bears Vol. 1 is Absolutely wonderful. We all enjoyed every episode. There is not one thing negative that could be said about owning this dvd set.
3,Gummi Bears Review,"Shipping was much faster than anticipated but was not really happy that the DVD's and my player are not compatible. Once my laptop has the proper sound system downloaded, I expect I will be very happy. The picture is fabulous, I just can't hear it."
5,Memory lane,I loved the Gummi Bears growing up and was so pleased to find that I could purchase the dvd's! I know my kids will enjoy them as much as I did.
1,Why low quality video?,Why use low quality video ????Disney should have find a better producer of DVD!!!I will buy it when they will make a qualities series.I am very upset!
3,Simply Busby,"A GREAT demonstration of the genius of Busby Berkley. Although the story content in a couple is very repetative, basically this is a good collection of musical stories and songs. Many favorites including Dick Powell and Joan Blondell are in their groove. Hugh Herbert is wonderful as always and provides great comedic relief. If you are looking for a few hours of light hearted entertainment then this is for you as it is Simply Busby."
5,Another hit,"My daughter loves these. They are creative, original, and still true to the world of Scrooge McDuck and the Beagle Boys. I have watched some of them with my daughter and even I enjoy them.The second season is just as good as the first and I am looking forward to getting my daughter season three."
4,Worth it.,This is such a good buy! It reminds me of the good ol days of watching cartoons in your underwear Saturday mornings.
5,MORE FUN!,"Duck Tales Volume 2 includes a Pilot and 19 Episodes in the 3-Disc Set, the Whole Gang of Ducks and their Friends with some of the most memorable Shows as our Friends Crisscrosses the Glove in search of Adventure, many funny Episodes and very Entertaining especially for children, I too enjoyed! Thank You"
5,Wholesome entertainment,My two year old grandson loves this DVD. I had the VHS tapes for his much older brother and cousin and they loved them too. This gives Grammy a time to rest while they learn. I still enjoy watching them too!
5,VERY EXCITED for new Rockin' Real Wheels DVD (out sept. 6th),"I am very excited to see that the Real Wheels series are releasing a new DVD of sing-a-long adventures which includes trains, fire trucks, and bulldozers this September. We own the original sing-a-long Train Songs on VHS and its wearing thin from too much use! Both of my kids simply adore the fun and educational Train Songs, so I am sure they will love the added programs and special features on the new DVD (especially my boys learning about their favorite tyke topics).I'm also hoping that the new programs supply the same high level of entertainment value as Train Songs did to help keep my energetic kids from bouncing off the walls. This should be a great back to school treat for the kids (and for myself)."
2,Not a very good guitar,"I bought one of these guitars by itself - not the package - played it maybe twice, and sold it the next day. It felt like it was made from a cut of really cheap pine or other cheap wood. The neck joint is very flimsy and the guitar easily gets out of tune because of this flimsy cheap joint. The pickup selector switch would cause bursts of static when switching while playing - cheap pickups and very little tone control - even though this is meant to resemble a Fender Strat - that's the extent of any comparison. This package would be okay for a beginner - better than the cheapo package guitars you see in the big box discount stores, but not a very good guitar. In the same price range - or for a few bucks more Epiphone and Ibanez might be a better choice."
4,good stuff,"I love the sponge block, it really allows flexibility.The kit worked well. I have a 39 gal.tank .I noticed at the end the finer papers wore out."
1,waste of money- went in the trash after I spent hours in GI agony,"Since Kraft Sweet Honey Catalina Salad Dressing contains not only High Fructose Corn Syrup but also the diarrhea inducing BLUE 1 I absolutely cannot rate this product highly. Google ""blue 1 adverse reactions"" for a long list of complaints. Heck even the FDA issued a press release linking this petroleum derived food color as ""casually linked to fatalities."" Buyer beware.I now make our own healthy ""honey Catalina"" using basic pantry ingredients of water, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, sugar, onion, honey (local raw is amazing!), sea salt, Italian seasoning, garlic, black pepper, turmeric and paprika (listed in order of quantity). I blend thoroughly and freeze the extra in 1 to 2 week supply freezer containers. This is *amazing* in taco salad recipes!"
4,"Marvelous search for the ""real"" Butterfly","Madama Butterfly has always been one of my favorite operas so when I saw this book I was intrigued. And it is full of intrigue and investigation, myth and attempts to pin point the truth. I found it quite amazing (even though it occasionally logs down in minutia). Was this whole story based on a real ""Butterfly""?. It looks like indeed it is and the story is quite amazing. The author does not discuss the music - this is about the plot line and how Puccini struggled with many different versions to come to the opera we know. If you love this opera, I think you will enjoy all the insights you will find in this book."
4,"Great show, but the video quality is spotty","If you're a fan of any of David Wain's work, you'll like Wainy Days, plain and simple. It's hilarious. However, if you're checking this Amazon page out, you probably already have seen the show, as it's available for free online. And if you haven't seen the show, just go watch it. It's really free. The whole thing. So go watch it.I'm glad I bought the DVD, because the extras are a lot of fun, and it's a good way to support the project. However, my only gripe is that the video quality is pretty much the same as you get online. So the later episodes that look good online look good here, and the earlier episodes that look like bad online still look bad here. I was hoping said episodes would've been remastered, but unfortunately they haven't. Maybe this is just the highest quality source available, and the raw footage is unavailable, who knows."
1,Not Satisfied,I was not satisifed with the set of 4 Feather pillows. The pillows was very thin and I had to place 2 pillows in 1 pillow case to fill a little confort. I would not recommend these pillows.
1,bulletstopper,Snoringly informative. You need decimal ratings for things that don't deserve more than one hundredth of a star.
2,unimpressive,"I bought this dvd after reading the glowing reviews posted on this site. I should perhaps have noticed the dates, as the visuals are far from impressive and in fact dissapointing. The music is cheesy and simple. I suppose the visuals may have been impressive when first released, but their is nothing extraordinary about this in 2003. Not at all worth the $20 price tag"
3,Smashed,The chips are great but the box must have been dragged behind the truck. My dogs' biscuits arrive better packed and in better shape. The chips are great but don't plan on using them whole.
1,Disappointing book,"[...]I have read a number of Jyotish books including books written by Indian authors. I would not recommend you to buy this book.Its not good at all. Mostly just a mechanical reproduction of some principles without explaining them properly.The main thing that bothered me was that the author has not shown the use of navamsha at all. Most astrologers in Indiadont even start analysing unless they see the navamsha also.[...] If you are a beginner read, ""Light On Life by Hart Defaouw"" . Its the best for beginners!After reading ""Light on Life"" , read ""Elements of Vedic astrology 1 & 2 by Dr.Charak"". The book by Dr.Charak is one of the most comprehensive book in English (other than classical texts).Point is that there are numerous great Pandits and scholarswho have written books on astrology and these books are a thousand times better than this one.[...]"
4,conflict:Desert Storm 2-Back to baghdad,"desert storm is the second most realistic game I've played but it's the best game I've ever played!!! All the guns are real. The graphics are great! The makers should of made multiplayer so you can go against each other instead of cooperative. The unrealistic part is when you get shot in the head,neck, or chest you don't die. Other than that it is a perfect mix of hard and easy !!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not What I Order Out of Pocket by Sellers mistake,The item shown was not what was sent to me I have sent it back but have been advised I will only get $15 forpostage actual cost 18.01
4,"Rhythm, Melody, Color, Joy","Many listeners ease into classical music gradually, starting with the mainstream composers such as Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, etc. Then they may listen to more modern composers such as Ravel, Debussy, Copland, and perhaps Stravinsky. Some get hooked on Mahler, Sibelius, Wagner, and so forth - but how many have listened to the delightful music of Darius Milhaud (1892-1974)? This new release from Naxos offers some of Milhaud's most famous compositions in excellent performances at a budget price, and is thus a CD that anyone who enjoys classical music might want to give an audition.With his liberal use of instruments such as the saxophone, Milhaud frequently puts something of a jazzy spin into these compositions, and his vivid use of voice and percussion makes his music a treat for the ears. There is rhythm, there is melody, there is color, there is joy. This is fun, fun stuff that you really ought to hear."
3,Poor engineering,"As is often the case with Naxos recordings, the sound engineering here is terrible-really almost substandard even for private archive recordings. This is not always the case with Naxos, but for the audiophiles on Amazon, look elsewhere."
3,Uh oh.,"I bought this for my boyfriend, and it's apparently a great microphone, but be warned! It doesn't come with the cable. So make sure you realize this before you purchase."
5,Faultless sitcom,"This is one of my favourite TV shows and possibly my favourite sitcom. It's got everything - intelligence & wit, originality, and is very well acted by some very attractive people.Every time I watch it I get disappointed by the fact that theres only one series."
5,Wow!,"Television producers missed this one. A great show. I love how honest this show is about the service industry. But it also is way funny. I plan to buy a copy for my managers and myself, as soon as I can. Probably for Christmas. So if you work in the service industry, around food, then you will find it rip roaring hilarious, come on we all know these people presented here. So buy it for yourself."
4,A series as delectable as its' food,"Kitchen Confidential is light, breezy, and funny. You will adore it, because it comes in just the right amount and each of the characters is perfect in their own quirky way."
3,Kitchen Confidential: The Complete Series,"A great show that should've been given a chance. Fresh, sexy and fun!I enjoy it and I'm glad to own a copy of it."
4,Jack Ketchum is The Man!,"This is my fourth Ketchum novel, and I have yet to be disappointed. Jack Ketchum can create some of the most realistic and disturbing characters.The Lost literally starts off with a bang and definitely gets your attention. You immediately know who the bad guy is--and that guy is Ray Pye. He shoots two young women (while his friends Tim and Jennifer watch) at the beginning of the book. One dies and the other is on life support. Four years later, the second victim dies, and it seems Ray has gotten away with murder.After this episode in the beginning of the book, there is a lot of character development and interaction. With the partying, the teen girls, he is on top of the world (I guess those crushed beer cans in his boots help). Ray gets what Ray wants, and when he doesn't, things end very badly.This was an awesome book and highly recommended!"
3,Uneven Thriller,"I was excited to read this Bram Stoker Nominee by Jack Ketchum. This is my first time reading this author and although I was slightly disappointed, I will give his work another chance. I have no idea why this book takes place in the 60's. Except for the rare mention of the Vietnam war and the Sharon Tate murders, it could have easily taken place in modern times. I never got the sense of nostalgia or flavor for that era. Also, I felt some of the chapters were uneven, some quickly racing through the plot while others dragged on endlessly without any payoff (ie... the New York City dinner with Katherine). The novel is peppered with some akward sentence structure and very few, if any, likable characters. However, it has it's moments of tension and suspense. I compare it to a good television movie."
2,Not very impressed.,The guitar didn't work!! The amp worked but the darn guitar did not work. Now I have to go to a nearby store to get it fixed. What the heck is up with that?
5,one of my favorite books of all time to read,"This is on my favorite books to read when i was littler, ive gotten a little bit older and still love them but i lost the entire collection when i moved away to college and am thrilled that its on amazon, going to order the whole set as a keepsake :)"
2,obsolete information,"While this book has some interesting points, it is prior to the current bankruptcy chapter 7 laws and therefore not too pertinent to current rules. I would not have purchased if I had known that the info was not current and complete for the present."
3,Could have been better,"- only 16 states allow residents to use Federal exemptions (including Michigan) so they only provide a few measly examples for state exemptions, so if you live in one of the 16 states that allow residents to use Federal exemptions don't expect much from this book- book repeats instructions already on forms over and over; could have eliminated 100 pages at least if they just said follow instructions on forms- if you've read forms, read ""Bankruptcy Basics"" flyer at Federal website and gotten few few consultations you can skip this book"
4,"nice reading,","this is a nice book. my daughter and I read it for bedtime stories she is 11. The stories are very short which can be good and bad. You need to have alittle understanding of the bible stories so u can elaborate, or some r confusing. usually after we read a page i will ask my daughter to give me her idea of what she thinks the story means, so its good for conversations about the bible."
2,Not your normal read by EJD,I have read all of EJD novels. Thieves Paradise was not a page turner for me. I had to push myself to finish reading it. I couldn't get with the characters.
2,Something to Read,"Thieves Paradise is something to read if you don't have anything else to do. I am an avid fan of EJD and I am totally disappointed in this work. It is to discriptive in some areas and personally, for me it was like waiting on paint to dry. EJD's writings are usually very exciting and passionate but I really don't know what he was trying to do with this one."
5,Entertaining read!,"This is vintage Dickey. I had become a little worried after his last book that he was slipping, but Thieves' Paradise has alleviated my worries. What I liked most about the book was the change in direction, the criminal element, yet maintaining the style that has made most of his books entertaining.Definitely a strong effort. Thumbs up!"
4,Kept my attention!,"I am a big EJD fan and this book definitely kept my attention. I wish, however, that he had provided more details about Scamz. He was the most interesting character to me and I really wanted to know more about his life."
2,Ejd's Worst,"I am a fan of EJD but this is the worst book I have ever read by this great author. I don't even know where to begin to explain how much I did not like this book, so to sum it up,the book just simply should not have been written. I wish I could get my money back. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are prepared to be disappointed."
4,dynamax for dakota / durango 5.2 3.9 5.9,great exaust for the price and great sound also. very melow in noise and great performance with out blowing your ears out inside the vihicle.Highly recomend.Gassman
5,Turning Seventeen continues to explore real teen issues,"Even though Maya has always had a good relationship with her father, it still feels like she can't really talk to him. When he says that she can stay home alone with her friends she is thrilled - but then he says she has to stay at Marleen's house. It could be worse right? Then Maya tries out for the track team and misses her usual spot - what is happening? When one of the other girls offers her some vitamins she isn't sure that they will help, but there is more to the vitamins than meets the eye, and someone may hurt her before she has a chance to find out the truth. Another eye opening book in this true to life series, I wish that this book had been around when I was seventeen."
5,great read!,"Wonderful and funny would be great words to describe this book. disney movie, Summer Magic is based on this book- great movie!"
2,Stitching is not very solid...use with caution!,"I bought these for my little guy who has Autism, to use as a color/animal/counting educational tool. One of the frogs arrived damaged, and the seller never responded to my request for a replacement. Within 2 months, three more had stitching that came loose, leaving only one functional. For the price, this product should be better quality."
4,Does the job,"We use these diapers for our slightly incontinent older female Labrador Retriever and they work OK. I say ""OK"" because every once and a while we get up in the morning and her diaper is no longer on her. Not sure how she gets them off but she does, so at night we double bag her and that seems to work well. The price on Amazon is about half of what we paid at a local big box pet supply store."
3,Not the best quality,The service was great; fast and problem free. The doggy diapers were unfortunately kind of poor quality The tape closures fell off way to easily.
3,executioner's song VHS,The video will not track in my VCR. I watched it once. I wont be able to watch it again in its present condition. Glad I didnt pay much for it.
2,They edited the entire point out!,"You know that something is lost in edited translation when the entire point is missed! SO much was cut out. Just absurd. By the time they finished with it, if you knew nothing of the story, you would have NO idea what was at all unusual or of special interest about Gilmore's case, or why a brilliant mind like Norman Mailer would have chosen to write the book! What's the point? And also.. what's the point?"
2,Why cut it ? Why ?,"People listen to me save your hard earned money and buy the first VHS tape of this, not the Euro one but the first one include 50 more min of the movie not shown on this DVD. I waited a long time for this to come out on DVD ,then you only see half of it ."
2,"SORRY, IT'S UGLY AND OLD.","I'd tried to get my hands on this book for years. I tried second hand bookstores all over the world. From Australia to Germany. One day I was in New York in this big japanese bookstore near the Rockfeller Center and there it was. I couldn't beleieve. It was to good to be truth. I bougth it imediatelly. I only opened it back in Europe a week or so after the purchase. My mistake. The book is old, ugly and not that accurate. There's more information in the kata chapter of John J. Donohue's Complete Kendo then in all of this kendo-no-kata... thing. Ok, it's a document. Ok, it's history. Ok, 2 stars."
2,Thoroughly Disappointing,"I was anxious to read the sequel to Stargate...and was disappointed by it. McCay spends WAY too much time dealing with the technical aspects of the story, and not enough time building the characters. Unfortunately, this contiues through the rest of the series, and becomes worse in the last three books. I wouldn't recommend these books to someone who is hoping to read about the characters that we know and love from Stargate...but I'd recommend it to someone who wants to know how to build a blast cannon."
5,Time for Yesterday,I love any story that centers on my favorite original Star Trek person - Spock. The fact that Spock had a son in Yesterday's son and now Zar has to help save the present/future is a great plot. The whole book was great and I read it cover to cover in one sitting.
3,Well written,"Time for Yesterday's is a nice sequel to A.C. Crispin's Yesterday's Son, which I also liked. I found this novel's writing much better though. Crispin has really developed as a writer: the dialogue, flow, and character development were all really good. After reading these books, you start to see Zar as having a completely independent personality than the others, filling up the room so to speak. His character is probably good enough for his own independent novel(s) if this hasn't already happened (I haven't checked what else Crispin has written).This novel's ending is slightly different than the first book's, more 'gradual' one could say. It didn't disappoint me, but I did like the Yesterday's Son ending better. Still, it's good that a writer isn't to predictable."
1,50 years of innovation???,"I have repeatedly been disappointed in our Rubbermaid laundry baskets. You've been innovating in plastics for decades, and you still can't make a laundry basket that doesn't fall apart? And to add insult to injury, the last ones we got had a sticker in the bottom that told the story of a lady who used to play in her mom's Rubbermaid laundry baskets as a kid, and was still using the same baskets! Fat chance! Half of the baskets we bought just a couple of years ago have already lost their handles. (Strangely, some of them have stayed completely intact...I don't know the difference, since we abuse all of our laundry baskets equally.) But we only use them for laundry - the kids don't even play in them. The Sterilite baskets we got at the same time, though...they've held up quite nicely. I'm now a Sterilite convert."
3,Almost appeared in the film,"This had to be one of LDP 1st films. It was filmed in Frisco, TX (population aboout 1,500 at the time) in about 1985. I was asked to appear in the film as one of the members of the band - but my family was going on vacation at the time. I later saw the film with my youth group and met the cast. I remember thinking that it was a fun movie with Christian morals. It was also fun to see my friends and home town on film. Would be fun to own for memory sake."
5,Surprisingly good,"I'm amazed. I wanted to buy an electric pump, which all my friends recommended, but decided to give this one a try, and I'm happy I did. Such a saving compared to electric pump! And it's very convenient and pretty quick. Easy to assemble, easy to wash, easy to use. Just great!"
5,Such a great pump!,"I LOVE this pump! I use it every day all day. My daughter falls asleep almost instantly when nursing so I decided to switch her to the bottle so that I am not nursing her ALL day. I pump each breast for 5 minutes and I can usually get a total of 3-4 oz every 2 hours or so, if I go longer (like at night) I can get 5-6 oz. Since my daughter only drinks about 2-2.5 oz at a time that leaves me some to freeze for another time. I have been told I have a heavy ""let down"" so that may help with the pumping. With my first daughter I had an electric pump and I have to say that this manual pump works so much quicker and is an 1/8 of the cost. I have used this pump for almost 6 weeks now and have had no issue with anything, comfort, lose of suction etc."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this pump after reading all the positive reviews on amazon but unfortunately this did not work for me. First of all , it took an awfully long time to pump even a little amount of milk. I was left with a sore back and achy arms after few minutes of pumping. I just could not get enough milk from this pump so ended renting a hospital grade pump which worked wonderfully.I think this product might work for moms with a fully established flow of milk but might not suit moms who have just had their babies and with low milk supply. My advice try an electric one ( they look scary!!) and then switch to a manual one later."
2,uncomfortable,i purchased this pump and for me it was very uncomfortable (my nipples are too big i guess?)i ended up throwing it away and kept the Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump which came with two sizes and i could pump with one hand and feed my daughter on the other side at the same time
5,Use it more than the double electric,"I have been using the Lansinoh double electric pump since my now 5 month old baby was born, and bought this as I was going to be flying over Christmas. I needed to be able to pump on the plane if necessary, and at my destination where the power outlets are different to the US. This pump works really well and is pleasantly silent. The beeping of the double electric gets annoying and is not good for quiet middle-of-the-night pumping. This manual pump is also easy to use and to clean, and gets the milk out fairly quickly! I can pump 3oz from one breast in about 10 minutes. The only downside is that the flange is kind of narrow so if you have large nipples it might be uncomfortable. (You could visit your local lactation services and get fitted for a larger flange.)"
4,Good Alternate or Backup,"This works fine, but takes some work and patientce. I would recomend this as a backup, or one for the road since it yields a small quantity."
2,Epresses Milk well...but squeeks WAY too much!,"Okay...let me first say that for the price this is a great pump for expressing milk. I get the same amount of milk generally with this that I can get with my double electric avent pump. However, I rated this product with a 2 star because it squeeks so badly. It started squeeking within 2 weeks! Now, I did read reviews before purchasing and remember others stating that it would squeek as well. BUT...I had no clue how loud...it IS LOUD! The only way that I can get it to stop squeeking once it starts is to pull the pump handle to the side while pumping...annoying. Also, despite that it comes with two membranes it is already losing suction. I think it might have to do with the handle though.Overall this is an okay pump to get you buy until you can get a better one but I wouldn't plan on it lasting very long. In this case you get what you pay for.The nipple cream made by this company is amazing though!"
5,Best manual breast pump,"I owned a Medela manual breast pump prior to this one but it broke (my dog got at it somehow lol). Anyway, I decided to try this brand because of the reviews. The Medela was fine but I find this one to have a much more comfortable fit, especially because of the comfort shield that they supply. I also like that you can use the base to stand the pump up and to cover it when you have to step away for a moment. I have been nursing for 14 months and at around 8 or 9 months I started using a manual pump instead of my double electric for ease of use. It may take a little longer but the set up is so much easier when on the go. Great pump! Good job Lanisoh!"
5,Lifesaver for the frequent diner,"If you're like me, you're eating out more often and you find that you're running up quite a tab. (Your waistline is paying the price, that is!) For $12.95, you can have your own personal ""nutrtionist"" by your side at any restaurant, anytime--this book fits perfectly into your handbag.From a creamy frappuccino at Starbucks to dinner at your favorite Italian restaurant, this book has you covered. 20 popular cuisines are featured as well as everything in-between (even airports and ball parks!). The author, Hope Warshaw, tells you exactly what's healthy and what's not, from soup to dessert. To simplfy menu choices, the book lists Green Flag (good) words and Red Flag (bad) words for every type of food. Each chapter includes sample meals with calorie counts and nutrtional data. Don't leave home without it!"
2,Not for Developers....,"I've seen this book and it's no more effective or should I say inefective than the two other Marco Cantu books I wish I should not have purchased. Unfortunately, being a Delphi developer there is just too little reference material out there. Don't get suckered into buying any book with misleading titles. I happen to own the previous versions Developer's handbook and the Mastering Delphi book. I barely use them. This book like the others are geared more for beginners. Too many examples that don't apply to anything. My first purchase was a mistake, my second purchase was just plain stupid!"
3,Okay to average+ programmers,It aint get the goal. This is just like the previous book with few corrections and addons
2,My last Sybex book!,"I respect and admire Marco Cantu for his contribution to the Delphi community. However, this book will not help anyone with any prior Delphi experience. At best, this would help developers that ""played"" with Delphi and now want a ""light"" insight into Delphi 5. I think Sybex is to blame here. Marco please find another publisher, which will let you go...."
4,"Good reference, not for newcomers","Marco said so in the first paragraph: If you are a newcomer, don't start with this book. He's right. Get something else to get you into delphi. Get this book to master it."
2,Beginner Luck.... NONE,I am usually quite nice when it comes to reviewing anything but i am a student studying IPT (Information Processing Technology) and doing Delphi. For me this book has done nothing but confused me. I am a beginner and am looking for a book to get me started and teach me code in the simplest form... if anyone knows any then EMAIL ME please. I believe that as soon as i have that experience under my belt that this book by MARCO CANTU will be very greatly appreciated. It is definately NOT a book for BEGINNERS! INTERMEDIATE TO ADVANCED users I reccommend this book but BEGINNERS NO!I think i'll get a copy of Delphi 3 for Dummies because hopefully that will teach me what i need to know. Beginners once again this HUGE 1100 page book i believe is not aimed at you so don't spend the AUD$85 to buy it if u're in my case. THANX BYE
2,I wish I had read other reviews before buying this book :(,"It is VERY badly structured, not at all comprehensive (despite the number of pages), and definitely not for the beginner who actually wants to do something rather than just marvel at the brilliance of Delphi 5.For example, all I wanted to do (initially at least) was read some data (from an ascii text file) into an array and after processing it chuck the results out into another text file. Not until page 8 hundred and something was file I/O mentioned and then it was promptly ignored.Reading this book made me think that I had to build a database in order to do this!"
3,"still a good book, but I'm very disappointed","I am very disappointed when I got this book. However, I can't give it any lower rating because it IS a good book for someone who wants to learn Delphi or for someone who wants to enhance their delphi skills. However, the book bare touches the new topics in Delphi 5 and it did not cover any detail on those new topics. To me, this book is identical to the last 3 books. It's just collecting dust sitting on my desk. Would someone please explore the revamped MIDAS, the new internet express? These are only 2 of the most important topics in Delphi 5 that's missing from this book. (ignore the topic holder chapaters....)"
4,Something's Missing - I expected more,"SO MUCH from the Delphi 3 version is missing including a ton of basics. I read Mastering Delphi 3 to pieces and considered it almost a one-stop source for nearly every topic I needed. Sorry, not so with Mastering Delphi 5.In all fairness, Marco's website has a link to Essential Pascal which makes up a lot. That was the difference between three and four stars.Still somehow I feel like the examples are shorter and most topics are covered rather briefly. For example, there isn't ANY mention of TeeChart that I could find while there was in Mastering Delphi 3.I think that each chapter (of any modern programming book) should have a URL for a site 'to learn more' in this day and age."
2,Cursed Forever,"The Burning is one of the sagas set in days of old explaining the curse that possesses Fear Street.it is an interesting read but it involves much death and is not a cheery book by any means.So I am wondering if it is really worth it.There isn't really a positive aspect or moral to it.Except, perhaps, that the Fear family's own evil is what eventually destroyed them."
4,Scottish Film Comes into Its Own,"Scot Pack is a history of Scottish film, an analysis of the impact of two films--Braveheart and Transpotting--on the Scottish film industry, and biographies of notable Scottish actors from Sean Connery through the Trainspotters (Robert Carlyle, Ewan McGregor et al.) to some lesser known figures. Brian Pendreigh's biographies are interesting and incisive, his history of Scottish film brief but informative. What would make it a five star book is a conclusion. He discusses the interconnections between today's Scottish actors but comes to no conclusions about how this influences their work and Scottish film in general. Nonetheless, this is an interesting and absorbing book which any fan of British, and especially Scottish, film should enjoy."
4,Short but good,"This Exam Notes was surprisingly good. I've had a few years on the hardware side of networking and over a decade on the operating system side so I'm relatively demanding of a network test prep manual. It presented the information very concisely and simply. I'm not going to run out and take the Network Design test just on the basis of this book, but I do have a better grasp of the basic subject matter as I approach more complex information offered in the full fledged manuals. Good prep for deeper study and would probably be an even better review."
2,Votz the big deal mit Kaminsky?,"I have never read anything by Kaminsky and solely on the basis of reader reviews, I tried this one. Alas, 'twas a fizzle. Mildly interesting but basically fluff. I'll grant you it's ""clever"" but in wholly predictable ways. When it comes to weaving together suspense, violence, plot twists, and insight into Mother Russia, there are others who do it much better. Kaminsky stays on the surface of the snowdrifts. It's a formula book wearing a fancy disguise with a great title that deserves better."
5,TaleSpin,"Hillarious antics of a Bear and his sidekick as they try to stay a step ahead of the badguys. Good, Clean, Family Entertainment.A refresher from the ""norm"" of today's tv shows."
2,"Don't judge this book by its cover: Good idea, poor writer.","The reason for such a low score is that I had such high hopes for this book.What I first thought would an in-depth look at ""honest agents in a failing agency"" turned out to be just an exercise in ""finger-pointing"" and 20/20 hindsight.Instead of investigating the deep-rooted causes of some of the ATF's problems along with some possible solutions; he blames such groups as the FBI and the NRA while calling for the abolishment of the ATF itself.The ATF has a lot of internal as well as external problems. On occasion they have made serious mistakes in judgement that should be corrected. In my opinion, this book does nothing to aid an already embattled agency in a struggle for its very existence.After I read the book, I donated it to my public library. I couldn't place it next to other books I own such as ""Inside the CIA"" or ""The Puzzle Palace"""
3,So So,"Hard to pinpoint this book, A lot of information is right in this book and is well laid out, but their are simple things that are just completely wrong given in the book. This book would be very confusing for anyone that hasnt had a couple of years experience working with the products. I would suggest using this book as a overview of what is going to be on the test and then suppliment areas you are weak on with other books. All in all a good book but just way too many errors."
4,Very good and dependable material !!,"There is not that many books out there that covers the extensive topic of qualifying for the CCIE written.This book is well written for readers to know all the topics involve in the exam.With this reference and a combined additional resources from author like Jeff Doyle , Cisco press and Cisco technology page you'll definitely pass.Great work John S. ."
4,The Best I've Read,"It's the best CCIE written book I've read. I passed the exam today and I believe I could have passed it with just this book. I used multiple sources to cover myself, but if you had to send me into battle with just one book, this would be the one.It is well written and easy to understand. The author understands his audience. He writes as if he wants you to learn the material. I can't tell you how many times I've read a CCIE level book where the author seems to speak from a pulpit. Not here.It gets four stars, not five, because there were a few times (very few) where I wanted to know a subject in depth, and there was just a paragraph or two."
2,You can't pass the CCIE written exam with this book,"Todd Lammle did a good job on the CCNA book. However, this book has so many errors including technical errors that it could confuse you more on the exam. Even the answers to review questions contain technical errors. The authors released this book in hurry. The cdrom that contains the entire book is nice.The best CCIE books still are the Cisco Lan Switching (The Cisco Press Ccie Professional Development Series) by Kennedy Clark, Kevin Hamilton and the Routing Tcp/Ip by Jeff Doyle."
2,Not what I thought,"You're supposed to use a lot of this product. I have long hair, so it only lasted a few times. Plus once I used it, I might has well used shampoo because I still had to blow dry. I couldn't imagine using it camping."
5,My old Rolfs nylon wallet,"My review is about my ""now "" rolfs nylon wallet . It is at least 25 years old , washed many times. I don't know how old it is , my long departed wife gave it to me many years ago . The only problen with it is the Velcro closer is worn out . I am happy to see Rolfs still sells them. OBW"
2,Misleading,"If you are viewing the picture for this product, it would seem that it is in the same package as the previous James Bond Blu Rays. That is not the case. It looks cheaper than the previous released versions."
5,Why do they keep doing this to us!!! Read more...,"THE FIVE STARS AERE FOR THE BOND FILMS ONLY!!! Why keep screwing us Bond fans over and over.I mean,they release just 6(random!) older films,in no sort of order,get me wrong,I love James Bond films,I love Blu Ray,but this just does not take the cake,the right thing to do for the fans is release them in proper sets as follows,A Sean Connery collection,Roger Moore,Dalton,Brosnan,etc,most fans I know would like this idea MUCH better,and also release the movies seprately for those who only want certain titles!!! Heck they even did the same thing for the DVD's which were 5 random Bonds in 4 differnt collections for a total of 20,I do admit they did a great job w/ the remastering,and extras but still? And I heard that the Blu's have playback isuues w/ certain players,a Royale mess!!! I'll keep my DVD's and money until these are released properly!!! The five stars are for the films.not the way they are packaged."
3,The James Bond Collection VHS,"Not a bad collection of Bond material, however, this is a mix of various Bond movies with a variety of leading Bond actors. I recommend looking into the 1996 Collections that have the videos in chronological order and primarily by actor. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 1 includes all six Broccoli-produced Sean Connery Bond films, to include a 1995 documentary video. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 2 includes all seven Roger Moore films and Timothy Dalton's first film. Although these sets are out-of-print, they are still available as used and collector's sets through Amazon.com's Marketplace. If you're like most fans, you'd prefer to have the movies that include your own favorite ""leading-Bond-man""!"
3,James Bond Blu-ray Collection: Volume Two (For Your Eyes Only / From Russia with Love / Thunderball) [Blu-ray] (2008),Great video. Audio is reasonable. Packaging terrible. Holders for discs are cheap POS and the discs fall on out everytime you open the gift box.
4,Great classics,For 007 lovers an excellent choice to renew or start a collection. Image looks great and I hope Number 4 comes out soon.
3,Great set but won't play on some players...yet,"As stated in another post, these discs do not seem to play at all on some stand alone Blu-ray players even with the latest updates. Maybe future firmware will fix this. Fortunately I have a PS3 and they seem to play just fine on it. Honestly I don't know why I bother with the stand alone unit as the PS3 loads and handles the java soo much better.On the actual disc quality, they offer clean, clear video and great sound! The Blu-Ray version is a big improvement over the standard DVD version. If you have a PS3 to watch them with I highly recommend."
3,Ai dios mio!,"The typos in this book drove me nuts, but if you can get past them (if I can, anyone can) it's an entertaining--and stomach-churning--read. Not too deep, not too thorough, but rather a light overview of the subject. Great to have on hand if you don't have access to actual issues of Alarma! magazine. Which most people in North America probably do not. Gorehounds will not be disappointed. People looking for ""cultural enrichment"" probably will be."
4,Chalk one up for Chuck,Chucke Cheese's movie was a big hit with the kids after a big turkey day feast. The kids seemed to really enjoy the music and funny chase scenes. It was a great movie that kept them entertained and out of trouble.
2,Exterminator of the 3000 Bears,"""Exterminators of the Year 3000 (1983)"" is an Italian thievery of 80's movies such as ""Escape from New York,"" and the ""Road Warrior"", but I'm not even mad since there's enough unintentional comedy to satisfy all Mad Max fans.One of the greatest terrible movies of all time! It's the end of the world and the post apocalyptic world bad guys have eye liner and an endless supply of water carts and big claws that stick out of their pants.Maybe it's a gem if you're a fan of low-budget, poorly-acted, Mad Max rip offs."
1,Stupid Stupid STUPID,"My brother and I rented this movie years ago. I thought it would be fun. I kept watching it in hopes of finding something to justify my time. It kept getting more and more stupid and pointless. I watched it to see how stupid stupid could be. It was exceptionally bad. I maintain that all coppies of this movie should be gathered together, put in a pile in a vacant field and burned. The ashes should then be salted so that nothing could ever grow there again. Perhaps that would be too extreme but I rather disliked the movie. I also talked to the video store manager for several minutes about how bad it was. There is an hour or two of my life I wish I had back. If you like this type of movie perhaps you would like it. It just is not my thing."
2,Not so good...,The edition is very old and it is very brief on some important topics. There is better books on subject likeEngineering Electromagnetics.
3,There Are Better Guides Out There,"This book was a needed resource when it was first published in 2001, but now (2011) there are newer, better guides available. This book is written at about a middle-school reading level as a very simple introduction. However a better anime overview for middle school kids would be the 2008 reference ""Anime"" by Hal Marcovitz. For parents and educators, a more thorough explanation of the anime phenomenon is available in the superbUnderstanding Manga and Anime."
5,Covers all aspects of animation,"This guide to Japanese animation covers all aspects of animation; from the pop culture which surrounds it and the history of its rise outside of Japan to anime genres, actors, distributors and products. Collectors and fans of anime will find Anime Essentials fascinating and informative."
2,confusing,"Not that much happens in this sentimental drama: it is all about the relationship between the two lovers, intense, emotional, carnal. There are hot sexy scenes every other page in fact.Problem is the thick - and important - dialogues are unintelligible: you never understand who is speaking what and this is quite a problem in this kind of story. The story seems interesting and emotionally full, I shall try to read it again and decipher it but will it be worth the effort?"
4,Three of the Best,"This is one of the best ""Garfield"" DVD's they've ever made. Three of my all time favorite Garfield 80's primetime specials in one package: ""Garfield in the Rough,"" ""Garfield in Paradise,"" and ""Garfield Goes Hollywood."" There's only one thing that's keeping me from giving this DVD collection a 5 star rating, and that's the fact that ""Garfield in the Rough"" was edited slightly. My parents had taped this one back in 1984 on it's premiere broadcast, and I remember, during Garfield's Hawaii and Acapulco daydreams, he was singing a little Hawaiian tune, and a bit of ""La Cucaracha,"" respectively, at the beginning of each fantasy. On the DVD, they're removed (probably because of political correctness, I don't know). But other than that, this is an awesome complitation, and classic Garfield."
1,Voit balls are awful!,"I bought these Voit 8.5 inch playground balls last year, and will never do so again. Some of the balls came with holes already in them. Those that could be pumped up only lasted a few days. I used them with my third grade students. I expect playground balls to be durable. We tend to use them on tennis courts, and against walls - to play Wall Ball, of course! The balls that I could pump up only lasted a few days. I will never purchase Voit playground balls again. This time I'm giving the Champion balls a try."
5,I ORDERED THIS BY MISTAKE!,"I ORDERED THIS THINKING IT WAS A VICTORIA BOUTENKO CO-AUTHORED BOOK.VICTORIA WROTE A SMALL FORWARD. HOWEVER I FOUND THAT I LOVE THIS BOOK, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT! I JUST WISH THERE WERE PICTURES."
4,Just like the real thing,"I recently moved from Venice, California to North Carolina. I was truly missing my regular visits to YAS. This video was made in the studio where the yoga classes take place and is the exact format of the actual class. It's like having the studio in my home.Great Workout - simple, effective and easy to follow."
3,"Not a ""Single Source"" Study Guide","I have been using the Sybex books to study for Cisco exams for a couple of years. The original CCNA book by Lammle was excellent, but subsequent books (while still including Lammle's name) have not lived up to the earlier standard. The CID 3.0 is a fairly tough test due to the vast amount of material covered. This book can be used as an outline, but I certainly recommend using additional sources to study. The Cisco Press CID book (Birkner), along with this book, should suffice as long as you read and fully understand the material. Good Luck!"
1,CLUB KID HELL---GET OVER THEM!,"HELLO ALL...I JUST SAW PARTY MONSTER AT THE LONDON PREMIERE ON OCT 21st..OF COURSE JAMES WAS THERE...BUT I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS WHOLE PRODUCTION...MICHAEL MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF A FEW , BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE HE WON MR. GATIEN'S APPROVAL AND HE GAVE THAT MESS A CHANCE..BUT I CAN SAY THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE GOING ON OTHER THAN DISCO 2000..WHERE IS KEOKI NOW? THAT WHOLE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE DIDNT SURVIVE...THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER FREAKS THAT STILL LIVE AND ARE SO MUCH MORE INTRIGUING...LIKE RICHIE RICH....HELLO...HEATHERETTE!!! AMANDA AND SOPHIA. LARRY TEE...SO MANY ...AND NYC WASNT THE ONLY DISCO MECCA...LA IS WHERE THE WAREHOUSE MASSIVE THRIVED IN THE STATES..BEFORE ALL THE MTV RETARDS GOT AHOLD OF SOME TRACKS AND MADE A COMPILATION...I MIGHT SOUND DISGRUNTLED BUT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTRIGUED BY A LOSER WHO GOT CAUGHT AND ARE MAKING A CULT HERO OUT OF HIM...THIS IS NOT SOMEONE I WANT TO REPRESENT MY GENERATION AS AN UNDERGROUND FIGURE..."
5,Interesting,It's very interesting to see the documentary to one of my favorite movies. I find it fasanating to hear from the people that were really there.
2,a little let down,"As someone who followed the whole thing as it happened, I was really disappointed by this movie. It was very poorly done. The whole thing is sophomoric and much of it is arbitrary or dull. The editing is awful, as are the re-enactments. It's an exploitation film of the dullest variety.I am totally mystified as to why Screamin' Rachel is so prominently featured. I think that was the part where I finally realised the filmmakers didn't know what they were doing."
3,"Good price, fast delivery, wrong resonator.","I bought this exhaust system for a 2004 Monte Carlo. I'm sure installation would be quite simple but unfortunatly I recieved the wrong resonator with it. The diagram that came with the system and the box had 2 different part numbers. It was supposed to be 2 1/4in but I got 2 1/2in. That made it bit of an inconvienience. Instead of sending the resonator back I opted to use reducers. Also, the clamps for the tips were not a tight fit and we had to use a metal shim. Now that the exhaust is on it looks and sounds awesome. I probably would have given it 5 stars if I would have had the correct parts."
5,Please....Please...have it in kindle edition soon,For Bahai's prayer is an essential way of life...Please add Kindle format....as it would allow everyone who values prayer to have their books and prayer book in d same format
4,Definitely an above-average book.,"Surely focussed on the CLSC Cert. exam, it has a few minor glitches here and there like the end of the chapter questions on the default switching type for the 1900 and the 2820 series switches (it's Fragment-Free anyway). Also need to put in some more info. on the Cat. 3K switches although the 5K switches have been excellently presented. Passed the exam though. Surely one of the better books for the CLSC exam."
3,Wonderful study guide but ....,"This book which has just been released provides the reader with all the necessary info needed to cover the CLSC exam objectives. I found some discrepancies however on the Edgetest disc. On the book it says the default switching method for 1900 is FragmentFree (which really is) but on the exercises it gives the answer as FastForward. There are also other sections for which an errata from Lammle is highly warranted. So all you friends of Todd who gave this book high ratings, get real, OK. In fairness to the author, it is still a wonderful book."
4,Thriller for Thought,Once again Lisa Gardner gives us a pulse pounding page turning book. I had a hard time putting it down. Lisa needs to continue writing such great books and shw definetly must write more novels with Detective D.D. Warren
5,To the Lisa Gardner Fans,"This book was in GREAT condition as promised. I am a Lisa Gardner fan and in the process of collecting all her publications. This book is a MUST, thank for your excellent material!"
5,Great Plot,"FBI Special Agent Pierce Quincy suspects his daughter's death was not the result of drinking and driving, but foul play. He hires novice investigator Rainie Conner to look into the matter for him, which seems to open up a hornet's nest. After Pierce's ex-wife is murdered, Rainie believes that the women close to Pierce are being targeted by a psychopath intent on seeking revenge against Pierce.This is the first book I've read by Lisa Gardner, and I am so pleased to have found a new mystery author to read. The plot was great, full of twists and turns. Great book!"
2,Not As Expected,"After reading other reviews, I purchased this book. I find it to drag quite often. It does NOT keep one turning pages. Very disappointing book."
4,You ever wonder where your next accident will happen,"I Like all Lisas' books, and this one did not disappoint."
5,More reading,I love my kindle and all the books I have gotten to date. This is just another in the series. Sure it will be a good one.
3,Bought as a gift,I honestly do not know if this book is good or not or even what it's about since I bought it as a gift.
4,a very good book,this is a good mystery book didn't want to put it down. A little slow at first. Enjoy all of Lisa Gardner books.
5,Lisa Gardner,I discovered LIsa Gardner in Aug. I saw her book and the summary sounded interesting. The Next Accident was fantastic. I had trouble putting it down. The characters are great and the action is non-stop. I must add that in the past month I have purchased and read all of her books. ALL of them. Each was as fantastic as the first. I highly recommend.
4,Good Read,This was a good story. The characters had a lot of baggage that got boring after a short time but a lot of little bits made this a quick interesting read.
2,A page skipper,"I'm happy for people who can write books. Good for Miss Gardner.I had to skip page after page after page of this book, too boring. I think publishers should get a grip and spend more time reading what they publish. If they did, maybe disasters like this wouldn't happen so often."
1,I agree with Lover of Books...,"I stopped at the scene with the baby elephant. I read for escape. Having this kind of ghastly scene presented to me for no reason at all was too much. The story of the baby elephant could have had a happier ending, but she chose not to provide it, and I won't be trying any more of her books."
3,Could have been cut down a bit.,"There's not alot of choices for study guides for this exam, and it will soon be rewritten when the new exams come out. But, for the price it was ok, and worth buying. It might save you a retake on a $100 exam. Too much repetition, some info is repeated word for word a few pages later. Sample test questions were poor. The protocol analyzer that he used to display frames made them difficult to read (Etherpeek), other places he used SnifferPro screen shots(better). The objectives were covered 'exactly', but don't expect this to be an exam question dump. You still have to read thru the usual fluff they use to fill books, but at least it's a little shorter. I also purchased the Syngress/Osborne book and will review it as well."
1,HOPING FOR A BARGAIN,"I wanted a cheap powered sharpener for my 6-year-old - I ended up buying 2 of them! ($7.99 from Amazon - $7.29 from Office Depot! (I always expected Amazon to be beat the price of someone like Office Depot but now my innocence is lost.)First one stopped sharpening (it whirred a lot) but I found out my son but the eraser end in so I wrote the problem off to abuse. The second one suffered no abuse at all - and still, it's functional life span was only a couple of weeks. I don't intend to spend $30 on a quality sharpener - maybe I'll teach him to use a lead pencil.Don't bother."
1,Disappointing--doesn't work,"I was hopeful that this sharpener would be as effective as the Panasonic KP4A I'd seen reviewed (I believe this X-Acto is made by the same company). The battery sharpener worked sporadically at first, then I thought it was working consistently. A week or two later, I went back to try it again and it hasn't worked since. After I finish this review it's going in the garbage--unless it miraculously works again on a last try. I'm really disappointed in this product."
5,A handsome bargain that works well!,"Cannot imagine how some of these customers could not insert a pencil into a hole without things going haywire! This works beautifully, looks nice, and is inexpensive. What more could you want? Well of course you'd certainly want something more ""industrial strength"" for constant daily use in a classroom filled with kids! But for my small office, this is ideal."
1,pencil sharpener NO STARS AT ALL!,I put batteries in 2 sets to make sure it wasnt the batteries BECAUSE IT DOESNT WORK AT ALL! And of corse i threw away the box it came in so i dont think i can return it!! THE WORST PURCHASE IVE EVER MADE FROM AMAZON.COM!!!!!! ño stars at all!
2,Art Students Avoid This Sharpener!,"If you're an art student that uses animation or soft pencils, 2B and up, this sharpener is a waist of money, it fails miserably in producing a decent edge."
2,NOT GREAT FOR CLASSROOM USE,"I don't usually write these reviews, but I was extremely irritated with the way this product turned out for me.As a high school math teacher I am always in need of a good pencil sharpener, but considering I personally buy more than half of my school supplies, I couldn't afford to spend a lot on one. After reading the reviews, and deciding to purchase it, I anticipated receiving a great working sharpener for little money!NOT THE CASE. After ""teaching"" my students how to work the sharpener - hold the pencil firmly, press VERY gently, take it out quickly - over and over again, it broke. It constantly would break the lead off the pencil and get stuck in the sharpener. And finally it just completely quit working. So after only four weeks of school, it is getting no use whatsoever but collecting dust in my desk, while my students are back using 99cent plastic sharpeners. It worked great for me personally, but for a classroom of young adults/teenagers, it is not worth it!"
3,Dizzy!!!,"If you don't hold the sharpener still, it spins in circles!!! Needs to be screwed to the desk! C'mon man"
1,Broke the 1st Day,Terrible broke within the first 5minutes just stopped working. Very annoying since it was a birthday present and it was opened and broke at the party in front of everyone ! save your money
2,Great knowledge base but ill prepares you for the exam.,"Althought this book does teach you a lot of the basics you need to get ahead in a computer career, you could memorize this book and still not be perpared for the A plus exam. Beware if you studied this book for months and think you are ready for the exam. You will lose $128 dollars if you do so!!!!!!!"
3,Good basic book that needs supplementation,This book is a good starting point but needs to be updated for current technology. I found myself searching for more information from other sources.
5,"""Fun"" stuff on your iMac!","Those of us in the Mac community need no introduction to Bob LeVitus. As a long time Mac user and relatively new iMac user, I bought this book knowing that I would get lots of useful information from Bob. I was not disappointed! This is not a ""how to"" book. Rather it assumes you know the basics of your iMac. As great a machine as the iMac is, all of us will not know everything it will do. This book tells us quite a bit. In additon to instruction on various hardware and software tweaks on your iMac, the book also includes a wonderful cd-rom with tons of useful software and demos. In conclusion, if you already are familiar with the Mac OS and how the iMac works, buy this book. You will not regret it."
5,"Childhood brought to life, just put it on DVD please!!!!!!!!","Oh yeah, love this movie. I had it taped off of tv for a long time, but it eventually faded away. The movie faded from memory until I found the off of tv tape when cleaning out the old tape shelves. After that, I had the words with that little tune from the movie ""Fligt of dra-gons"" stuck in my head. I was amazed to find out that it was still around. I AM SOOOO GLAD TO HAVE THIS MOVIE. This is a great movie, and totally worth the buy."
5,Give Birth to this DVD,I have a hunch the DVD will be made available outside the US but wherever I have to go to get a high quality copy. The VHS I own is faded. I saw it years ago as a teenager by channel surfing and took note and for the longest time I couldn't even find it in the video stores. Released back in 82' at a time when Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio ruled radio. Ommedon is my all time favorite [...] next to Darth Vader.
5,Thank you!,I have searched for this movie on dvd for a couple of years now and was thrilled that someone was finally selling it. Thank you so much.
5,flight of dragons,Flight of dragons came in quickly and worked perfectly. I have already had many hours of enjoyment watching it with my son and nieces and nephews!
4,Great little movie,This was one of the first movies I can remember taping when I first got a VHS as a kid. It is a simple but great little fantasy piece well worth searching out. Also should you have broadband access to the net check it out for free at www.cinemapop.com.
3,It Was OK,"When I first got this movie, I was expecting a stupid, cheesy ""Puff The Magic Dragon"" wanna be kind of show. It was only purchased because it was one of those deals...of ""Buy this movie with this other movie"". And it was listed with the movie of ""Heidi's Song"", so I figured, ""Why not?"" It stayed in my collection and collected alot of dust for a several months. Then one day I decided to put it in and see how bad it really was. To my surprise, it turned out to be an OK show. It wasn't great, but it wasn't as bad as I was expecting either. So all in all, it was OK."
4,Such a keeper!,"I have loved this movie since when I can remember, and then I taped over it! Thank my lucky stars that it has come out again on tape. Huhzaah! This is such a good movie, with fantasy,suspense and fun. It can get a little hairy twards the end but the art and detail that is done threw out the show is such a treat. I recomend this to anyone who liked the hobbit, or even the last unicorn. Cheers! :)"
2,Don't rely on this book for the exam,"This book has so many error. I don't understand one of reader said "" NO errors and very good text"". Both ARCR exam notes and Study guide have a lot of error. The author even doesn't understand address summarization."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","I studied Laemmle's CCNA exam notes for two days and passed the CCNA. Unfortunately, the ACRC exam notes book is not the same. It reads as if a non-technical person edited it. It seems every other page has an error - and typographical errors in a technical text can spell death when studying for an exam. I gave up on this one and went back to the Cisco Press certification guide. The CP book is a lot longer and more tedious, but at least I can rely on the information inside."
5,Dog Incentive,This is a staple in our home. We use it as treats for our 2 dogs and they will do pretty much anything for it. I don't worry about giving them too much of this as a treat since it's actually a dog food.
2,Don't bother buying it,I took an A+ class and this was the book used. I wish I'd read the reviews here first. What a waste of money! I took the exam today and failed. I felt like I'd read the wrong book. Nothing I studied was on the exam except IRQs. Too bad the customer service questions don't count.
4,Pretty Good,This book covers alot of the basics that are needed for the A+ certification test in an easy to understand and read language. Recommended for anyone that needs to study for the A+ Exam
5,Excellent Books!!!..... I passed on the very first attempt.,These are by far the best A+ books on the market. I only used these two books to prepare myself for the exam and passed the core with an 89 and the win/dos with an 86. I would recommend these books to anyone interested in PASSING!
4,"Great for small spaces, but noisy","This unit does a good job heating up my small office (measuring about 10'x12') rather quickly, and its thermal control keeps the room in a comfortable temperature by turning the unit on and off automatically. The unit radiates heat over a pretty large area (with a small fan helping push the hot air out front). This means that it probably will do a good job keeping you warm in a larger space as well, as long as it's placed closeby.My only complaint is the noise. The unit makes a rather loud rattling noise when its heating elements turn on, which lasts about 10-15 seconds. The fan is reasonably quiet in the low setting, but can be distracting when on high. I certainly wouldn't put one of these in the bedroom."
1,really disappointed,We bought this to replace a holmes heater we had for about 5 yrs.Same type but earlier model.It worked exactly 2 days. we could not return it so had to go through the company to try and getanother. They did not have any left (it was January) so had to go and buy another one in a store. Have to wait untilnext winter to get replacement. The one we bought in the store has worked very good (also holmes) butif it would have gone out we could have returned it.Now is it the heater or the company I have a problemwith. Can not say as did not ever get it replaced. So I guess the thing is to NOT buy this heater unlessyou can return it to the store you bought it at. Otherwise you may be cold until they get more in.I really likethere heaters but not impressed with there policys in items that do not work.
3,Functional pin remover,"The pin remove is functional, but the plastic construction makes it unstable during the process."
4,Engaging overview,"The book offers the material in a very readable fashion. I got exactly what I expected from the title -- readings of parallel myths. The themes around which the parallels were drawn such as the ""hero"" or ""descent to the underworld"" made sense. More commentary on the themes themselves would have been of interest to me but then would have changed the book from a straight forward collection into a thesis. The final chapters of the book give a short but informative review of the key theories of how myths may be traced back to primordial events and societies. The author seems to be presenting this collection (along with short commentary) as a counterbalance to the rational materialism of our present culture that demands empirical evidence and eschews all things supernatural. His short closing arguments for the positive role of mythology in our present society are interesting."
3,"Interesting, but oddly organized...",I thought the stories themselves were interesting. But a lot could be done to improve this book. I felt that it was poorly organized and awkward to read through.
1,"Big, heavy, useless","I got this book thinking it will cover basics. Well it looks like big installation manual where you can skip first quater of the book (installation process). And I'm not a Linux guru, it was the first time I was installing it and it went very well. What's after the installation, how do I setup FTP? telnet? user accounts? groups? - I didn't find a good explanation in there. I'm going to the bookstore right now to return it. Gotta have O'Reilly books they are the best."
2,Not a good book for beginners.,I was starting to learn about Linux. This book gave a terrible experience that I thought I would stay away from Linux forever. Please do not follow the directions that author gave you. It would lead you to an dead end.
3,"Great classic TV, but needs remastered picture...","This show is a lot of fun to watch. It brings back some great memories. It could be even better if the studio had remastered this from the original film elements. I believe this series was shot in 35mm, which would even give the potential for a nice high definition transfer with color restoration, etc. But, alas, this is probably as good as it's going to get. At least the price is resonable."
5,Yes!,Very excited when I got these. I loved knots landing so much and was very sad when it went off the air. Hope you get the other episodes. Thanks
3,Super Comfy but Tears Quickly,"These shoes are so comfortable and soft, I literally kept my feet in them all day everyday. So much that after a month or so, the soles started to rip apart and the cushioning is coming out. I guess it was mostly my fault for wearing them so much. Also, they are not water proof in the slightest bit."
2,Don't waste your time and money....,"If you already know the basic CF structure, please don't purchase this book. If you have any question, I suggest you to check the Cold Fusion Reference Guide. This book is not the answer. So don't waste your time and money, here you couldn't find anything new...."
3,Lack of conclusion,"This is a great, suspenseful story, but there is no conclusion to the book. Actually, I became extremely angry at the author for intentionally stringing the reader along into buying the next book in the series (which he indicates won't be out till 2001)."
3,Get certified!,Network+ by David Groth will prepare you to pass the exam! This book covers exam objectives very well and Groth writing style is easy to follow. It certainly deserves five stars for that alone and if you fail the exam then it's not because of the book but rather the lack of experience. What I don't like in this book is too much detail on some topics (twenty pages to show abend.log is waste of paper) or almost no information at all on another (where is description on LMHOSTS files?). I don't agree with official amazon.com review that this book can also prepare you to pass Networking Essentials - get another book!Nevertheless I would recommend this book to anyone preparing to take Network+. Good luck!Ales Kavsek
3,"Not bad, could be improved","Overall, this is a good book. I like the way its layed out, and the information, while a little more in depth than I needed to know for the test, was very good at helping me understand the concepts behind them. This reason I give this book 3 stars is because there were numerous typos and some incorrect information, and with a certification guide, I expect the information presented to be well researched from the source, not from other study guides, and absolutely correct, with no typos. Maybe the second edition will improve on this some.BTW- with this book and Exam Cram, I passed the test with a 95%, only 68% was required to pass. I missed 3 questions out of 65."
5,Kirby vacuum bags,I ordered Kirby vacuum cleaner bags from Amazon last week and am very pleased with the product. The price was very good and I received them in a reasonable amount of time. I would highly recommend Amazon.
2,Kirby Vacuum bags,"I thought I was ordering the Kirby white bags that are longer lasting, thicker, and much better quality, Instead I received the smaller thinner bags."
2,Good Intent Falls Short,"What could be called a Colombian attempt at Kelly's Heroes fails to engage, either as military drama or dark comedy. Derivative, with characters that walk through the film as caricatures, a premise that could have been rich with adventure and humor, even serious themes, falls far short of its potential. A yawn..."
3,Great for CCNA exam prep but use with the Cisco ICRC book!,I liked the book for a quick prep review before taking the CCNA exam. However you need to use also the Cisco ICRC book with hands on practice with Cisco router to really learn the stuff. Great for exam review but not for learning Cisco without the other book.
4,CCNA EXAM CHANGE,This book was excellent to review and study from! However the exam for the CCNA has changed. I would like to know if anyone is aware of this? I just took the exam and it is 78 questions not 70. I got a score of 720 and needed to score 755 to pass. If anyone has any input let me know. Thanks
4,"Excellent Study Guide, But Not a Replacement for Experience","Lammle's Study Guide is well written and well organized. I took Cisco's ICND class, which I was told would prepare you for the CCNA, but Lammle's text cuts to the chase and tells you what topics are really important for the test. (ie, only ethernet, only IP & IPX, etc.)A word of caution: using Lammle's text to become a ""paper CCNA"" probably won't work. You need to know something already about networking. He tells you that you need to understand the OSI model and gives some details, but you really need to understand it beyond the book. (he suggests another text by his publisher for more details on most topics)All in all, tho, I would highly recommend this book. There are a few errors, and access to a Cisco router to practice on is helpful, but the bottomline is that this book is what I primarily used to prepare for the exam, and scored a 906 out of 1000 on the exam. (755 is passing) 'Nuff said."
2,Another Study Source,"I read through this study guide and actually found the questioning (and answers) to be helpful. This study guide should be considered just that - a study guide with Q&A. To pass the Cisco CCNA test you will HAVE to study in-depth access-lists, the OSI layers, ISDN, Frame-relay, Novell frame types, default admin distances, routing updates times, switches and types. In my test I was expecting and was prepared for a lot of sub-netting and but only had a few questions. The book I used as my primary study book was ""Cisco Certified Network Associate"" by Syngress Media. I also used the Boson Tests as recommended by Todd Lammle. These proved very, very helpful. One more thing, it is also very helpful to practice on a router (at least one). There are 78 questions in 90 minutes and no going back. I passed with a 822. Now I am studying for the ACRC test. Good luck everyone."
3,A back-up study guide.,"This is a good book but I believe it does not cover everything at the right depth.I began reading with very little knowledge about Networking. I used both this and the Syngress book and think that the Syngress one is the better buy. This was more readable and the end of chapter tests were far easier. However, this will not prepare you for the actual CCNA exam. On reflection, I would consider this book as an appetizer for the Syngress one.If you buy one book, buy the Syngress one. Only buy this if you decide to buy two books or if you, like me, are starting with minimal knowledge. Good luck in any case!"
1,Poor timer,"Bad purchase. The timer goes on at dusk, but then runs all night, even on the 2 or 4 hour setting."
1,Cheap timer does not work!,"I received the timer, plugged it in and it doesn't work. It blinks off every ten seconds or so. And no, it isn't because it is resetting itself because it is light outside. Returning it to get a different make."
1,"Did the weather zap mine? ""Outdoor"" Timer might be a fib",Worked for a little while (a few months?) ... then it became flakey (wiggle the dial position and it sort of recovered) ... then it stopped working at all on any position after about 6 - 9 months of use and I set on the shelf. At 11 months plus a few days I called Sylvania 888-548-4484 and right away the nice dude offered to send me a replacement. Didn't ask him what his response would have been if it was over a year old.
2,Just work randomly,"It works fine during the first few days, but for some reason stopped working after a week or so. The light was not turned off in the bright day time as expected during the last few days. I am disappointed."
5,Poussez,"Was not aware of this group 'back in the day', but am glad I happened upon their music! Great, truely great stuff!! If you like Beautiful Bend, Romeo and Juliet type sound, you will love this group. All the songs are nice and have a smooth sound. If you are a disco conniseur, extended dance music type, then be sure to own this one!"
4,The best book of the Shadows saga,"I read this book, thinking it was all about vampires. To my surpise and at first disgust, it was about creatures called shadows, they thought they were supposed to be evil, but the only thing evil was the Catholic Church. Christopher Golden astounded me with this complete new view on how people view things and ideas. This book inspired me to read the other books in the saga. Unfortunately, in the second, my favorite character was not a big role, and in the third, he became human. This book changed my whole view and ideas of the previous books I have read on vampires. His untraditional ideas have completely changed my opinions on what makes a good book. It was one the best things that has happened to me to buy this book and not get what I wanted, I got more."
2,It's censored,This is censored and doesn't say so anywhere. Don't buy it unless you want gaps in all of your favorite rap songs.
2,Getting repetitive,"It seems Bob has run out of ideas. This is last book that is worth reading. don't bother with Excalibur or the Truth. Bob has resorted to taking quotes from all the previous books and copy/pasting them to make a few extra dollars. A few details here and there are added, but overall the series has become tragically boring."
3,The Grail concept saved the book,"This novel answered a lot of the questions of the previous installments and the concept of the Grail made it one of the easiest to follow because the story it explains itself as it advances. On the other hand, the poor characters that have prevailed since the first book seem somewhat childish in ""Grail"". The dialogues between characters, especially the ones where the villain ""Al-Iblis"" takes part of (Duncan & Al-Iblis about Duncan needing water), sound like 5 year olds talking. Al-Iblis sounded like the villain from an innocent cartoon like the Smurfs.Again, the only thing that saved this novel was the history of the Grail and how it connects all the historic facts given in the previous novels."
3,Average,"It seems to me that the series lost a little steam by now, yet i'm addicted and can't not read the whole lot. Thats how good Bob Mayer is."
3,Not as good as Sphinx,"The action was fairly predictable in this 5th entry of Doherty's Area 51 series. It seems he keeps stretching out the story with more and more historical facts and tries to incorporate them in the plot. His overall concepts are not as good as his novel, ""The Rock"", but even with all the loopholes in the story, it's engaging enough for me to buy book 6, ""Excaliber""."
4,south beach dining guide,useful especially since my husband travels for work. I have been able to guide him in the right direction no matter where he is
2,Better off,"I don't like this product. It doesn't absorb water as claimed. It does glide alot better than a regular chamois, but leaves water behind"
5,Salt Lamps - A Bargain!,These are just as nice as the twice as expensive one from Whole Foods. Arrived promptly.
3,Didn't expect one with a flat side,"One of the 2 lamps was ok but the other one had a side that had been cut straight,flat and smooth instead of the natural formation it should have had. I placed it on a table that is by the wall so the flat side doesn't show. You don't know what you will get until it arrives. Some reviewers of these lamps shipped from Tiger Dive have had top and side cut off flat. Didn't send it back because of the added cost the shipping would have incurred."
4,Good book,"The book is pretty well written and it gives you enough information about miscarriages, however I prefer the way things are explained in the book Avoiding Miscarriage by Susan Rousselot."
1,Solid Wood Checker Set,I would not recommend this product.I would not recommend this product.I would not recommend this product.I would not recommend this product.
3,Quality disappointing,The checkers do not lock together when you king. Storage for checkersis good for a child's fingers but too small for an adult
3,This episode is not as well done as the episodes of the second season.,"The second season of this series is far superior to the first, based on this episode. The second season focuses on Wallander. The focus on Wallander's relationship with his daughter is not as interesting as the focus on crimes and Wallander's relationship with his colleagues. The second season is outstanding."
3,Need Improvement,"Compared with Professional Study Guide, this book needs detailed information on some new features. I am a NT4 MCSE, I still don't understand the proper usage of the Krbtgt account after I search her whole book. The CD seems OK with tests but it does not have sound when you study its WinSim. All you could do is to watch the mouse moving and guest what she wants to show us."
3,A very basic book that will introduce you to Frontpage 98,"This is an average book which will introduce you to some of the basic features of Frontpage 98. It very well could have been an outstanding book except for the fact that the CD ROM which contains lessons to follow as you progress through the book has problems. They did post a fix for the CD Rom but I still had some problems with it. I e-mailed MS Press for assistance to which they did respond. However, when I needed more detailed assistance and twice asked for a phone number to talk to a tech they did not respond with one."
5,Thanks Cpt_Kirk,Read Cpt_Kirk's review a few reviews down. It tells you everything you need to know. Forget about DEMO Linux. Install a full size free distro instead. Read the review.
1,Computer went down,"My computer will not load up now, it is displaying only text like a typewriter. There is no mouse or no windows on the desktop now. Where did it all go to, I tried to edit a file, now it gets hung on a kernal pan-ache or something.A good lesson learned from this, just stick with Windows at least if you have to turn it off it boots back up again!"
1,"No display, no Windows partition (deleted and all data lost!)","Where do I begin, you ever heard the phrase that youget what you pay for?Thinking I would give this a try, well now my machineshard-drive is gone, it boots up to a blank screen,flashing at me.Wonderful, I am work right now typing this review!0 stars is bettereli"
1,"PC is not booting now, what a nightmare!","Where do I begin, during the installation it statedit would not delete my Windows system off my computer.After dealing with a hung install, the pc froze theonly choice was to reboot it. This is worse than Windows,at least it will boot up afterwards. Now it says, missingWindows file and is not working. So basically all of myfiles have been deleted and I am stuck with a brokencomputer."
3,Not for men,"I bought this for hubby who has cold feet, unfortunately, it does not fit him. While it's a nice product and works effectively, it was not big enough to fit a man's feet. I don't even know where this item is in my house, if it had fitted, it would've been used regularly, too bad. Two stars off for not mentioning how small it is, making it useless in my household and a waste of $."
1,Didn't Come,I can't review this item since Amazon messed up the order and sent me something else and rather than sending the right item just gave me a refund.Have no idea if this item is really available or not. Hence the rating of 1 star is really for Amazon and not Abner Jay.
3,six of one.....a half-dozen of the other,"Well, Terrence McKenna took a lot of psychoactive plants and felt that thing we all feel under the influence----connected to everything else. Even without DMT, most of us have at least pondered the unity of all things for at least a moment, but is it a new cosmology? Or is it the only cosmology there ever was? Do psychoactives reveal mysteries?--in my experience, only if you're ready to learn them. Do DMT elves and the cosmic giggle hide even deeper mysteries? Only if you want or need them to. Do shamans in the Amazon and elsewhere who have been ingesting these substances since ancient times know something we don't? Probably, but what they know cannot be translated to the western lives we live....so the paradox cannot be unravelled -- only regarded -- and for westerners, that's not such a bad thing. Unless using psychoactives is the only way you can ""get it""."
2,Road to disaster,"This development method doesn't take advantage of the 3/n-tier method of development. It seems to me that the title should be the VBScript developer's guide. I saw one COM component built in this book, while the rest was based on stored procedures and ASP. I was hoping to see visual basic used more than once."
1,Best for Large Breasts,"This nursing top will work better for women with large breasts. I has great support and large cups, which does not work with my size B. For me all the extra fabric would just get in the way. Also, I found the clasp difficult to open with one hand, maybe this would get easier after a few tries."
3,Not as great as I thought it would be,"Friends raved about this tank, but frankly, I found it uncomfortable. The shelf bra was too heavy--thick fabric and thick elastic--surprisingly hot to wear in hot weather. Also, I thought that the 36D/E would be plenty big, but it seems to hold everything in a little too tight, which is not comfortable on the nipples. Still, it's a decent top, maybe just order a size larger than you'd think. The bra I have from the same company was great during pregnancy, but I've had the same discomfort with it while breastfeeding."
3,works but not the best,"I tried this on even before my milk came in and it was extremely tight and very difficult to put on. I even bought a size larger than I currently was. Once on it did a good job with support. You do need two hands to undo the clasp, which makes it very difficult with a crying baby in one hand. Overall, it works as a nursing tank top but it definitely could be better."
2,comfy but not practical for use as a bra,"This tank is stretchy, comforatble and serves its purpose as a nursing top but I was hoping for much more out of the built in bra. I believe it would have provided enough support as a bra but it had no lining or padding so you could see nipples right through it! If you add nursing pads, you could see the lining of those right through it so I didnt not find it practical for that reason. I wish they would line the bra or add some padding like their Bravado Body Silk bra to this tank, and it would have been amazing!"
5,Gazillion Bubbles,I am a therapist working with children and these are the best bubbles. They last the longest then any other and even in cold weather when they are in my car they are the only ones that consistently work. Love them.
1,Not so much fun,It was difficult to make bubbles with this bubbler and there was a lot of wasted product just because the bubble ring is so big and a lot of the soapy substance clings to it and is eventually wasted.
4,Oster Jar,"This is a great little accessory for the blender. I had one years ago that was somehow lost in our multiple moves. It is great, in particular, for many Indian recipes which we enoy often."
3,Better Than Nothing!,"I bought this video because my husband wasn't able to attend a class with me. We watched it and found it to be very informative. At times the video was hard to understand, due to technical positioning of the camera and the audio was a bit muffled in places. But the overal effect was like being in a class from the comfort of your home. Sherry kind of has a ""nasal-tone"" voice and is kind of sarcastic to the guys, so that was a little unnerving, but I think she did a good job covering the most important parts of childbirth. This video is a lot cheaper than a class, and more convenient so you can review things if needed. I ended up not watching all of it before my first child was born, because it was so realistic, it made me nervous!"
2,"Better Than Nothing, But......","If you can deal with the instructor's tendency to be a little loud and her generally corny approach to addressing ""sensitive"" subjects like leaking bodily fluids, then this video is a fair and convenient substitute for a live class. The tapes cover a lot of ground in four hours and give first-times a decent idea of what awaits them. I bought the video especially to practice breathing methods whenever I wanted, so I was especially surprised and annoyed that the video teaches really outdated techniques (like ""feather breathing"" without engaging the diaphragm, and chin-to-chest three-push breathing with knees pulled up). Fifty bucks is a lot to pay for substandard advice. Unfortunately, the other two videos I've seen out there aren't any better."
4,Very nice blade,"The blade arrived today in a rectangular box, neatly packed, with lots of cardboard to protect it. It comes in a rugged plastic container with CMT's logo and product information.The picture can be misleading since it shows two blades and this is the price for only one.Moving on, the steel on this blade is T1 tool steel, which i think should be stated. It is precision machined with a very sharp edge.The blade is etched on one corner with its measurements along with ""HLS"". (which i wonder what it stands for)Upon closer inspection, i find the blade is a little dry, meaning it was probably shelved for a while, but not to the point where it has rust marks. Not a problem, i oil it a little bit and it shines again.I had never bought anything from CMT before but i think i will from now on. Very good product."
5,Great children's book!,"Only once as a child have I read this book, but to this day I still remember it as one of the best. The illustrations are so life-like, and I just feel everything is done beautifully! A book every child should encounter."
3,Average Van Allsburg,"I use this book as part of the Van Allsburg author study I do with my class but it is definitely not one of my favorites. My students also prefer Van Allsburg's other works over this one. If you are a Chris Van Allsburg fan I would recommend buying this book; if you are not, borrow it from the library if you feel compelled to read it."
2,Cute but Nasty!,"I really enjoyed this product, but I was grossed out when I realized the Grow A Head breeds worms...ugh!!! If not for the worms, I would say this is a great product."
5,Love my Grow A Head!,"My grow a head actually grew faster than stated. Within a few days, my head had sprouted ""hair"" and within a week it was an inch tall. It has been really fun watching the grass grow and creating new hairstyles for my head."
5,"""The Conflict Management Skills Workshop""","This book is an incredible resource for corporate trainers and college instructors! I was able to use the activities in this workbook with my traditional classes, as well as my adult learners in factory and union settings. Students learn better with hands-on activities and through the use of antecdotel stories they can remember. This book combines both to make for a fruitful learning experience. We have long needed a resource of this caliber that takes theory and really shows us how to put it into practice. I will be waiting for more titles from this author."
1,Beware!,I was about to place an order for this CD and other CD's from this series when I investigated a little further. If you wonder why the music is so inexpensive it is because it isn't the original artists singing! I just thought I'd let you know!
1,Horrble. Stay Away.,"I was so surprised at how bad this filter is. I had it on while taking some night photos and it crated so many ghosts (I bought two, one for each of the lenses I was shooting) and it completely ruined just about ever shot I took. I'll never get those shots back and it was a rare opportunity to boot at that location. Splurge a bit and buy the more expensive variants."
1,Not the album you think it is,"This is not the ""Essential Waterboys"". It is the ""Secret Life Of The Waterboys"". I guess there was a mix up at the cd factory.Buyer beware."
2,This book never engaged me.,"Perhaps I read too much about this book before reading it, but I found the actual reading OF the book disjointed. Etty's journal entries did not seem to relate to each other and I finally just got tired of referring to footnotes for the identities of names mentioned. The therapist came across to me as someone whose license should be revoked. I just felt sad and lost, especially knowing the outcome of Etty."
4,Classic melodic hard rock,"With their band name and album cover artwork, you expect Axe to be a metal band. Instead, Axe delivers somewhat hard-charging AOR/melodic rock. Not necessarily REO Speedwagon, but not Judas Priest either. Call them the American version of April Wine.Released in 1979, Axe's self-titled debut is very much a product of its time. Rock albums released in the late 70's/early 80's have a certain sound. It's not easy to describe, but you can usually tell within the first minute that you're listening to something from that unique era. At just 35 minutes, Axe is a relatively brief album, but it is full of hard-charging party rock anthems. It may sound a bit dated 28 years later, but it's still plenty of fun to listen to.Axe should appeal to fans of 80's rock and metal, particularly bands like April Wine, (early) Foreigner, Demon, Blue Oyster Cult, and Uriah Heep."
1,DON'T BUY OFFICE DEPOT CARTRIDGES!,"After a couple of weeks of not working all that well, my Office Depot HP replacement cartridge stopped being recognized by the HP printer. Total b.s.!! I will never buy from Office Depot again, major hassle and major price gouging on their part, and the store is full of stuff you can find anywhere any way."
3,"Good, but...","I got this DVD from my library, and the waiting list was LONG, so it took ""forever"" before I got it. That may have colored my response to the film. I was expecting something ""great."" What *I* got was something ""good."" The relationship between Ant and Claire, a tad confusing at first. I thought she was a hooker, but then Ant was giving her money to go to college, then she was going with Ant to stay at his parents' place. Huh! It was never clear to me why Ant's relationship w/ his father was SO sour. Even if one leaves home, one doesn't need to completely cut off relations w/ parents. Then the brother -- a not very well developed thread -- TWO years he had been separated from his wife, still thinking they would get back together, and his parents didn't know that? I also thought Ant's ""conversion"" was too sudden. The scenery was gorgeous, the country folk were precious and all things considered, this film provided a pleasant 90 min. interlude."
4,Better than creme,I am husband of account holder. I have used this for a year or so. I like the fact that it is lighter than shaving cremes and gives a comfortable shave. I use it with Neutorgene Mens Anti Aging product. Has really helps my face. A bonus is so much less messy and wife loves the scent.
2,"Great features, bad design.","The player has LOTS of good features. I liked the firmware upgradability. Took less then 10 seconds from a CD-RW. Good file browser.... and a host of other features I wouldn't care about after a few months.The design of the player is worst. The CD's go in from the bottom. So if the CD retaining mechanism ( the ball bearing that hold the CD in place) get broken (which is very common), the CD wont stay in the player anymore! The hinges for the lid is made of cheap plastic. I bet they would break very soon leaving with no choice but to use it upside down.For those who want to run it on batteries, the player drains batteries like water. Don't buy it unless you want to run it with an AC adapter."
3,not what was expected,The first song is already on their album. The second song isn't that great. The third is OK but a let down for a remix.
5,more than just GoLive,This book in a good introduction of GoLive 4 but it is also much more. The author also gives great insight in to web design techniques in general and not just how to use GoLive. Very useful for both beginning and intermediate web designers.
2,Don't waste your money!,"Being new to web publishing and familiar to Adobe products, I thought that GoLive would be a good program to try. I downloaded the trial version and ordered this book to help in figuring out how it worked. What a shock to find out that the book woud lead you down a direction and never fully explain how to accompolish a task. There is only visual (master) references to important items that help in finalizing a web page. It may be useful for doing single pages or very plain pages. I found myself spending most of my time in the online help from adobe. What a waste of good money! The book would have been better titled ""Go Live for Dummies""."
2,Too Much Air - Not Enough Substance,"As a professional designer, I need to get up to speed with the latest applications in a hurry. This book seemed like so much empty space without a substantial dedication to the basic elements of GoLive. For example, the book began with a section on Web design. This chapter would do well at the end of the book, or as an appendix. As another example, it's not until page 175 that the book even begins to get to the meat of the program and then bogs down in bad organization and author diatribes on what makes for good Web design. Interspersed is the actual getting-into-GoLive-and-working-with it stuff. Wading through the fluff to get to the meat is tedious.This book could have been written in 100 pages. Save your money. The original manual is more useful."
4,Good Copy not Hajj,It's a good copy not bootlegged that we're used to. I could've ordered a more hardcore porn but I like playboy playmates. I'm really not good at these things plus it's really early in the morning so I'll just catch some more sleep.
2,Constant Hum; Use in Field,"This phone is excellent in every way except two:1: The Large Talk button will hang you up if you hold the phone with your shoulder.2: Beyond 20 ft. in my house, the phone conversation is accompanied by a constant hum (a B note, in fact) that rarely diminishes. The manual tells you not to put it near computers, etc, so I put it in a huge room with barely nothing in it, and the hum persisted. I called the free tech support line(nice feature), and, after about a 3 days of trying to get a real person, they proceeded to tell me the exact same thing: ""Do not use this product near computers, in the kitchen, or furthermore, near ANYTHING moderately electrical in nature. Make sure that you live 20 miles away from a city, and use a portable gas generator to power your phone in a large, barren field."" Of course, I'm paraphrasing a bit, but that's how I feel, and if I can, I'll return this phone promptly."
3,So where do I get a spare battery?,"One of the reasons I bought this phone was the spare battery charger--it's very convenient to just be able to replace the battery in the handset with a freshly charged one when necessary. However, this phone doesn't come with a spare battery, and so far I've had no luck finding one either on this site or in stores.Maybe if they didn't deliberately put those 3 standard NiCad batteries in a special case that will only fit this particular phone, but used one that's more common...nah, then they wouldn't be able to charge big bucks for the batteries, which I'll no doubt be paying when I do finally find a spare."
5,Wonderful for Arthritis,I bought these hand wraps for my 90-year-old mother who has severe arthritis in her hands. She loves them. At night she wears them to bed to improve the circulations and feeling in her hands
4,Good Read,I won't say you can't put it down but it Is sort of captivating. I forgot I was in a dentist's waiting room. I really like this book and glad I got it. Tony comes off as just as nice of a guy as I thought he was and he is not at all afraid to tell about where he came from.
3,NOT AS FUN AS THE TITLE,"MY 5 1/2 YEAR OLD DID NOT LIKE THIS GAME AS I HAD HOPED. WE HAVE OWNED IT FOR OVER A YEAR NOW, HE HAS PLAYED IT ABOUT FIVE TIMES. THE GAME IS HARD TO MANUVER IN MOST SCENES, AND A BIT TOO COMPLICATED."
1,"Just another ""Best Of"" CD, only worse.","What you have here is yet another of several Best of Talk Talk collections that are out there and this one is likely the worst yet due to the fact Essential has copy protection technology on it that can keep you from putting the music onto a mix CD or transfer to an MP3 player.You get the EXACT same tracks as are on their first compilation album, Natural History. The difference is Essential is probably remastered (unconfirmed, and would only make a difference on the earlier tracks), but Natural History has two additional live tracks (LIFE'S WHAT YOU MAKE IT and TOMORROW STARTED). Considering Natural History is about half the price, gives you more music AND has no digital rights management software to keep you from moving the music where you want I think it's a no brainer on which one to get (not this one)."
2,interesting but hard to follow for graduate student,Quite often incomprehensible(I'm a graduate student). Not that it's mathematically clear either. But he covers lots of interesting topics. I liked his group theory part best.
1,Expensive Coaster,"Ouch! I've collected just about every piece of U.N.C.L.E. merchandise available and this was painful. I'm a baby-boomer, too, who feels that the owners are missing the opportunity of a life-time. Hopefully, they're not waiting for some dismal motion picture screenplay to promote the DVD's. These recent movies based on TV series are simply awful and obviously desperate! If the British can successfully market ""The Avengers"" in the U.S. and have released U.N.C.L.E. overseas, what's the big hold-up? - thanks for nothing! ""Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E."" was clever and witty. This DVD doesn't provide it any justice.Recently, this DVD was re-released with enhanced features that have rendered the above review obsolete. The new DVD is worth the price and is a welcome addition to any U.N.C.L.E. collection (May 31, 2009)."
2,good gun but disapointing,"There are a number of good and bad features. The gun heats fast, and has a full size trigger. But, the gun constantly falls over because it rests on the trigger and not the handle like most guns. Also the nozzle drips a lot to the point where it drips all over the place. Perhaps i have a bad model, but i would not buy this product again."
3,A Real Dripper and Tipper,"I was proud to by an American made product, until I burned myself twice. The flip out support stand is worthless and more of a hindrance. I will make my own cradle for this tipper and dripper. Come on Arrow, you can do better if you want to stay in business."
3,It is alrigght,It is very hard to get the ice out of the mold after it is hard. Running them under warm water isnt very helpful...so I freeze Kool-aid in them and let the kids enjoy !!!!
2,Snap beads should hold better,"Beads were just in a clear plastic bag when I opened the Amazon box.---no product packaging as other brands have and what we are all used to seeing on store shelves. Thought it was odd.Real complaint: Pieces do not hold together very well. You could nudge the pieces and they come unlinked. It takes no effort to pull apart. As a result, not very challenging and my son gets quickly bored. They need to have tighter connectors. I bought this one because it had 24 pieces, when I probably should have gone with a better brand name. We have played with this type of toy before at the library and my son loved it, but I didn't know who made them. Guess I bought the wrong brand. Very disappointing."
2,Not good for a bedside lamp,"This lamp is very pretty and was easy to assemble. I bought this lamp to use on a bedside table. Parts of the glass panes are frosted and parts are not. The bulb shines through the non-frosted areas and is too bright to have on a bedside table. I cannot read in bed with this lamp for this reason, even with the lamp on the dimmest setting. I put the lamp in the guest room and our last guest had the same problem. I gave the lamp two stars because I cannot use it as I intended to."
2,Blah,"After the first two chapters, you sort of get the gist of THE ENTIRE BOOK: feed your dog raw human food and it will live forever and never get sick! Each chapter mentions a dog or cat who was super sick and benefitted from eating raw meat and scraps from human food (dogs have historically been scavengers, eating scraps of human's food garbage). It's not a terrible book, but is most beneficial for someone who is into homeo/naturopathy/holistic medicine and wants to apply it to their pets. It did not change my mind on how to feed my pets and I will continue to bring them to a traditional veterinarian (holistic vets are few and far between)."
2,"Run, Don't Walk, to Live at Max's Kansas City (Deluxe)!!!","For completists only. I TRIED to enjoy these discs, but the sound is terrible. Live at Max's Kansas City (Deluxe) is such a better ""bootleg""!! It renders these Quine recordings for study only, not enjoyment. And if you REALLY want to hear the Velvets at their greatest live, check out ""Live 1969, Vol.1"" & ""2"".Also, for 30 bucks, the packaging is really cheap and minimal. I know they're supposed to be bootlegs, but GOOD bootlegs are usually beautifully packaged! NOT worth 30 bucks. Worth about 10 bucks, folks. I was very disappointed with the Quine Tapes."
4,Sister Ray,"""Oh-ho,"" sez I, reading of the release of the Quine tapes, which have been floating around on bootlegs for years. ""Mebbe I'll be able to hear something...""Alas, no. It still sounds like it was recorded off a mono cassette playing in a cold bathroom.But what is striking about these tapes is that the Velvets were every bit as guilty of endless noodling as the Grateful Dead at their goofy, self-indulgent worst.Or wurst, if you prefer. More later."
5,Painting flowers on rocks is fun!!,"I got this book just before Christmas and was able to paint enough rocks to provide presents for my family and close friends. The author provides all the information you need, from how to choose the shape and size of rock for each project, how to prep it, how to layout the floral arrangement and then how to paint (step by step) realistic flowers and leaves. There are a variety of projects primroses, tulips, daisies, Hostas, petunias, daffodils, caladiums, pansies, mums, roses & flower baskets. I can't wait to start painting rocks for my own garden."
5,Being creative,"It was such a pleasure to receive Lin's book about painting flowers on rocks. I have several of her other books which has brought us lots of hours of fun and fantasy. We appreciate her talents and her sharing her ideas with others like us. Her flower painted rocks are perfect for places like cemeteries that don't allow fresh flowers. It helps bring beauty to our loved ones graves without the work and worry of live plantings. The rocks require ""no watering!"" Thanks Lin for all your creative ideas."
2,not my favorite,I have a group of friends who love to get together to paint rocks. I've bought several books for ideas. This one was not my favorite. There was really only one idea in it that I liked and the same pattern was published in a magazine that we already owned.
4,Solid Racks for the Price,"I'm satisfied with this rack. It's well designed, easy to switch out, and sturdy. The hinge at the base allows easy access to our tailgate even when the rack is loaded. The only drawback is that the individual bike holders slip relative to each other over time such that bikes will not be parallel to the bumper but rather skewed at some angle. This can probably be easily remedied with some sort of stopper (i.e. electrical tape) but I'm yet to try this."
4,Powerful: Sad and Lovely,"The Orange Girl is the first book I read by Gaarder and I was wonderfully surprised. This book reads like one that was co-written by a father and his young teenage son, so the language varies depending on whose words you are reading. The backround story is of the meeting of a young man and woman, and their love for one another. It is also the story of the death of the man when his son was four years old, and his need to write him a letter to be read later in life. Gaarder's book is rather like a ""dialogue"" between father and son, through the words in the letter and their impact of his teenage son about ten years later. Wow -it is powerful book!This book is special. I would also like to recommend it to those who have lost a loved one and still need to grieve. The Orange Girl will help you grieve."
4,ASL but not as interesting to baby,"The ""Baby Signs"" books are great to go through with a baby because the pictures are very inviting for the baby. I hoped these books would have that same inviting quality but be in ASL. Initially, my baby didn't like them as much as the ""BabySigns"" books, now at 15 months she seems to enjoy looking at the pictures in these books every bit as much as looking at the babies in the ""Baby Signs"" books.This books gives an excellent illustration of the ASL sign with each picture along with a drawing corresponding to the word."
1,poor quality,"I recently bought this stethascope as a less expensive alternative to the Litman cardiology I had that finally broke after a good 4 years of use. Although it had the look and lumen thickness similar to the Litman, with fairly good diaphram, the bell side had terrible quality. Also it would try to twist on you while in the ears make it very uncomfortable. The last straw was when the eartip split after just 2 weeks of use. I have returned it to Amazon and ordered a duplicate of my original Litman Cardiology that I know is a great product. It'll be 150% more money, but well worth it."
2,Poor organization of information.,One of those books that you have to know the name of the bug before you can look it up! Its organization should be by photos within groups and then reference to write-up. (Find the photo of the bug you see and then refer to write-up.)The write-up should refer back to photo if you know the bug's name and want to know what it looks like.A very elemental book. Writing is good and parts entertaining. Not a serious book for people truly interested in insects as a hobby.
1,disappointed with product,"The rings I received were not like the ones in the picture. They were dark and dingy. The silver was very thin and weak. The tops of the rings were extremely thin. They look like cheap dime store rings. If this is the quality of the rings this company sells, I will not be placing any more orders. The pictures are beautiful. The rings look thick and shiny. Not at all what I received. The only thing that was want I wanted was the size."
5,This s*** right here,"This s*** right here, works prime time. I've had issues with other post shave lotions(redness, irritation, ineffective), but I use this after I shave everyday and I have had no issues thus far."
5,EXCELLENT!!!! Listen to it all the time.,I have both the CD and the cassette. I listen to the CD in the house and the cassette stays in the car. This album has a great selection of old time favorites that you can listen to over and over again. You'll never get tired of hearing the great harmony and individual voices of both Patricia and Ray Rich. Listen to it once and you'll want to listen to it over and over again.
1,enameled counter mats,I expected the counter mats to be made from the same material as my Corelle dishes - not from the cheap tin item that I received. I only rated this item with one star because I could not get out of the page without filling in the rating - my rating for the product is zero.
3,gangsters,"The book, ""Gangsters"" by Adam Woog, really intrigued me. The book talks about six gangster such as: Al Capone, John Gotti, and Ben ""Bugsey"" Seigal. These gangsters were mob bosses of the United States between 1890 and the present. Woog talks about when they were born, why they became a gangster, and how they died. What I liked about the book was that it keeps the reader interested throughout the novel. ""Gangsters"" is a book about American history because gangsters had a lot to do with crime in the early twenty-first century. Most of the book spends its time in New York and Chicago. When you get done reading the book, you walk away with a brief overview of gangs and how they work. With having said this, I would recommend this book to anyone who has a knack for learning more about gangs, drugs, women, and violence."
4,"Now in paperback as Blood, Tears and Folly Volumes I & II","This book is now published and available from Amazon Books in two separate volumes: Blood, Tears and Folly, Volume I and Blood, Tears and Folly, Volume II. After reading and enjoying both volumes I looked to Amazon to find Volumes III, IV, etc. Strangely, they don't exist. Deighton has only covered the period leading up to WWII and the war up to Pearl Harbor. Lenny, where's the rest of the story? Jack McCord 11 Jan 1998"
5,"Blood, Tears and Folly","Outstanding - an absolute must read for any WWII buff. Deighton gives an inside look at the key strategies, decisions, personalities, weapons and battles of the war."
5,"Beautiful, Well-Crafted Music","Moon Over 97th Street is a favorite album of mine. The songs are very well written and stick with you after you've turned off the CD player. The performances are excellent, and the clean production and arrangements create a mood that's perfect for the material. I can't wait for their next CD!"
1,Did not work for me,"The only reason I gave this product 1 star is because of preventing acne and outbreak, I gave me really bad acne I never had before. As first I thought it was something I was using for my face so I stopped using all of them and just used this face wash. I then continued to develop really bad acne on my whole face. Now I regret buying this thing because I have three bottles I haven't used.While it didn't work for me, it might work for you. Not everyone's skin is the same so this review is only for my face. It might work for you as it has for some of the people who have reviewed the product."
1,Trash!!,"Dont waste your money and time buying this garbage,the sound and images are the worst I ever seen in a movie. If you want to see tornados, war and violence you can have it for free at TV every day and you can have a better idea of Nostradamus predictions on internet."
3,Wrong Title on Spine,"The title on the spine is listed as ""Towards A Philosophy of Education"" instead of ""Formation of Character."" (All of the content inside is correct and the cover correctly identifies the book as ""Formation of Character."" It so happens that ""Towards A Philosophy of Education"" is another volume by Charlotte Mason. Because her series is often purchased as a reference set, it may matter to some that the book is mis-labeled on the spine.That is my only critique; the content of Ms. Mason's book is, as always, perceptive and thorough."
5,What's better than Duck Tales?,My son absolutely loves these. Sometimes the older cartoons are better than the new ones. They were deIvered on time and unharmed. Very happy.
4,Average intro strategy book,"The interesting thing about this book is that it tries to explain basic strategy concepts about competition, differentiation, etc. using some economic terms/formulas. It's a good introduction to strategy if you've never taken anything like this before but nothing really new here."
3,wordy and confusing examples,"It has been years since my macro/micro courses, so I am a bit rusty and slow on the uptake. I find this book very wordy...could be much more concise. And some of the examples are not fully explained. Also, no explanation of some of the chapter end questions are included. Not very good for learning on your own."
4,Excellent Coverage but...,"Filled with the most current information and packed full of the latest theories, this book delivers on it's promise to deliver an analytical base for economic strategy.But some sections contain high fog counts and complicated discussions to describe relatively simple concepts.Some of the examples offered as proof of theory seem forced. Instead of proving the theory, they show that other (undiscussed) strategic influences are at work. While expanded awareness is definitely a good thing, such examples tend to undermine the theories they purport to prove."
2,Too techy,"Well, well, well beyond the touchy-feely strategy realm. It should be required text at U of Chicago and not Kellogg, but look who wrote it. If you are taking the basic strategy course at Kellogg, you can consider the book optional since the profs don't even use it during the course (unless it is one of the authors). If I had the capability to digest this book right now, I wouldn't be wasting my time getting an MBA. No doubt, however, that this book is loaded with information that I feel I will slowly be able to reference, comprehend, and use."

No doubt, however, that this book is loaded with information that I feel I will slowly be able to reference and comprehend."
1,basically an empty notebook,"I was disappointed with this, I had expected it to have additional writing exercises in it not covered by the book. Unfortunately, it is mostly just blank paper (with fancy squiggles at the tops of the pages) for you to write in. Unless you find the matching cover especially motivating save your money and buy an inexpensive notebook or use your computer for your journaling (or spend your money on a truly special journal that you pick out yourself). This offers nothing that the book itself does not."
4,Great Tool,"We learned about Mark Gungor at a secular communicating class and bought this DVD when we got home. He has so much useful and great info that helps us both communicate and understand each other better. This however, is NOT the full conference! The whole conference including the sex talk is on a different DVD."
5,Genuine Horror and Suspence.,"Cube is one of the best Horror/Sci-Fi movies ever made. Yes, the acting was a little shakey in the beginning, but still the movie was horrifying. Not only did it have suspence and blood, but also a look into the mind of differant people when confronted with a terrible obstacle. Some lose it and some try to find a way out. The tag-line sums the whole emotion of the characters: Fear...Paranoia...Suspicion...Desperation."
3,13yr old girl,"This movie is very strange. It is filmed the whole time in the same decor, and you get a bit sick of it (so did the people inside!). A cop, a criminel, a docter, a student girl who's good at maths, an office guy and a mongol. Who will get out - who will die? This movie is different to others, but I must say there isn't one movie in the whole world that could frighten me. Not even this one. It shows how crual people can be when it gets to life or death situations. You could say the mongol was the only sain person in the whole thing. The dissapointing part of the movie is that it does not reveal you what that cube actually is. I think we wouldn't be able to understand anyway."
3,"Interesting, but irritating","I like the premise of the whole movie, but the fact you never find out what the whole movie is about tells me that the writer/director wasn't creative enough to make that part up. The woman are good actos, but the black guy totally overacts"
5,cube,"I really love this movie, i have seen it before but it is a movie that i do not own because i can never find it in the stores, i love how different this movie is that is what attracted me too it, it is like a giant puzzle that these people are stuck in."
2,like Pirandello . . . but with blades,"I think it's worth watching once.While I did appreciate the spectacle of people trying to work their way out of a deadly trap using mathematics, I would say that the film fell apart when the director tried to ramrod some allegorical meanings into it. The writing wasn't well-wrought enough for me to buy any of them.The idea that the Cube was originally a mammoth public works project that got out of control was serviceable enough, and hey isn't that like life? The problem with these metaphorical approaches is that certain events in the movie disallow them. Then how do you explain how everybody got in the cube? How do you explain how they don't remember? How do you explain how they left off questioning Worth when there were many other things he could have answered?If the director wanted this to be an allegory, he should have insisted on a script without so many leaks in it."
3,"Good movie, bad ending","I really enjoyed watching the movie. Up until the end, the plot is cool and interesting, the visuals are great, the acting is more than decent. I was really glued to the screen up until the ending.The ending is the part that ruined the movie for me. This is only a personal opinion of course, but I was SOO disappointed by the lacking ending, that it actually ruined the movie for me.. :("
3,haunting images,"okay, after i watched this movie, i ha some of the graphic images stuck in my head for a week and that was something i just did not need. it was a pretty good movie but i found it rather disturbing. i like Nicole deBoer in it but i prefer her less, um, 'dark' things."
2,Hmmm,"I rented the movie and watched the whole thing with the commentary. This may or may not have ruined the effect. What I ended up seeing was song pretty striking insight into a really low budget film. After some pretty neat looking visuals, we aren't really let in on why or what the cube is. And the whole math issue, supposedly made easy to understand, was really a head scratcher. Although the absence of a real resolution may have added to the mysterious quality, some sort of closure would have really helped the movie out."
1,A movie without a point to it...,"The movie is about people who find themselves inside a giant structure without any clue to why they are in there, how they got there or who built the damn thing. Well, after seeing the entire thing I still can't answer any of those questions! The movie gives a whole new meaning to the term 'open ending' - it can't be called an ending at all. The director leads us by the nose for 90 minutes, and when we get to the conclusion we find out there isn't any - the movie just ends. Avoid, unless you have a lot of spare time on your hands."
4,Okay...,"Cube was a very strange movie but at the same time it was one the few thriller movies I saw that was actually intelligent. The plot was weird but the makers executed it very well. The story goes something like this; Six people are trapped inside a maze filled with ingenious yet sick minded traps. To make things more difficult for the prisoners, all the rooms shift aroung the outer Shell.Although there was a relatively low budget and some of the visual effects were really cheesy most of the movie's suspense was left to imagination."
3,Cube,"The Cube is about five people who wake up, trapped in a large cube structure, full of booby traps and tricky doorways. The film is based on a theory of human stupidity, and what was scary about this, is I believe the story could actually happen in our future. I gave this three stars because of the special affects, and the creative set. Also this one will keep you at the edge of your set throughout the entire film. The acting could have been better, but wasn't bad and I highly recommend this one for all of you who enjoy sci-fi/horror, or anyone who would just love a good movie that never seems to get boring."
2,Welcome to High-Concept Hell,"Seemingly-random people are trapped in a giant, deadly Rubik's cube!There, you have the entire movie, sadly. This is one of those films where all the interesting parts are right up-front, and the actual film is filled with stock characters, predictable plot points, cliched interactions and juvenile conspiracy theories. We're lead to believe that the people were chosen deliberately, yet some characters seem utterly useless, added only to create artificial drama. The interactions are not believable, the climax an insulting cop-out, and while the lack of explanation seems to work for awhile, soon it fails as suspense and you just stop caring.It's not terrible, and you can admire how they were able to stretch out a minuscule budget. The acting is tolerable, though not good enough to transcend the shallow stereotypes they had to work with. Ultimately, no matter how compelling the concept, you spend the entire time waiting for an actual movie to show up, and it never does."
3,"Impressive, yet somehow limiting . . .","Cube poses plenty of questions and answers nearly none of them. That's going to determine a lot of your reaction to this film, so consider it carefully. I like to think of the cube as a metaphor for modern society - so many complex, surreal ways to lose, so little sense of purpose and goal.Acting is generally good, although it seems to get caught between the ""oh my god, this is so bizarre"" and the ""well, we're here, let's deal with it"" schools. Special effects are beautifully realised, and will make you realise just how much more good design counts for than a big budget.In the end, the film isn't about a cube, or survival, or mathematics. It's about group dynamics, and the sheer bloody-minded nature of humanity. If you're looking for a sci-fi horror film, this isn't it. If you're looking for a clever fantasy about human nature, welcome."
1,Love It or Hate It; I Choose the Latter,"Like human excrement in an art exhibit, some will say it's cutting edge, others will say it belongs in a toilet. The Cube is a similarly polarizing movie. You love it or hate it, as these reviews show.Everything you need to know: one-dimensional characters meet in a matrix of three-dimensional cubes, and get diced up, sliced up, and deep fried just in time for a cliched non-resolving ending that no science fiction fan will find the least bit surprising.Somebody flush."
3,More like 9 Original Songs and 2 worth hearing,"OK, there are admittedly more than 2 listenable songs on this album, but not up to par with At Sixes and Sevens where every song was amazing. The Other Side and Seven Keys and Nine Doors can stand up to the best stuff Morten's EVER done, but the rest just depends on how generous I feel when listening to it. I can't stand Mind's Eye, which unfortunately became the big single for this album, but I could put up with the rest of the album for the sake of getting to the really good stuff. That said, I don't like it enough to spend money on any tracks other than Other Side and Seven Keys. That's the beauty of spottify and MP3 downloads!"
2,Musicality,"Every song on this album is in the same key, or a derivative of the key. The lead vocalist rarely ever strays from the same center pitch. If you like gothic metal, AND musical diversity, check out Elis."
4,"More Photos, Fewer Words","The photographs in this book are fantastic and fascinating. However,the author's wordiness (comments on almost every page, written in a sort of notehand style) detracted from them. I would have liked to have seen a lot fewer words, letting these marvelous photographs speak for themselves."
2,Case interferes with USB accessory cord,"FYI...tried this aluminum case on two different iPODs and it interfered with the cord contact on the USB accessory cable for a 4GB 1st generation Nano and for an 8GB 2nd gen Nano. The plug goes in but not fully, and the slight gap (due to the hard case) was enough to prevent an FM adapter from working. Took the Nano out of this aluminum case, used a soft sleeve and it worked perfectly. THEIR description says you don't need to remove it to access the port, but 2 users couldn't make it work. It's attractive, thought it would give superior protection, but all you can reliably use with it is the earbud cord. Stick with the sleeves."
3,Not great,"This shave gel is probably the one I like least of the few that I've used. Although it's still probably better than using standard shaving cream, I have found that this stuff doesn't foam up very well, and has kind of an odd smell (akin to a Chinese soy milk drink...). I'd recommend instead Nivea Extreme Comfort shave gel, or Gillette Complete Comfort (both excellent)."
5,Wonderful,"A fine recording of talented singers performing beautiful music. Fabulous, ethereal singing, with a recording of such quality that it sounds good even on my two-bit crap boom-box."
2,Christian Martial Art?,"I'm surprised the reviewer didn't describe the specific aspects of the book he found so informative and would welcome an explanation of what a ""Christian Martial Art"" is. I thought it was about Hapkido."
4,Riveting mystery,"Malone's ""Handling Sin"" is one of my all-time favorites, so I was delighted to see ""First Lady."" It was fascinating--very complex plot--although I sometimes got restless with Justin's insistence at wallowing in misery. Cuddy was great, though, and the deductive processes were excellent. I had my suspicions, but wasn't sure about the killer's identity until the very end. Great job! I'm going back to read the other two in the series now, and have already recommended ""First Lady"" to two other readers. And if you haven't read ""Handling Sin,"" try it!"
2,Just So-So,"When Mama brought home a potty for Annie, Annie said, ""No."" When I offered to read this book again to my daughter, she said, ""No more."" Judith Caseley wrote this book based on her experience with her own daughter. Thus Annie's initial resistance to the new potty rings true. Caseley also includes trained playmate Samantha who tries to show Annie the ropes, a tactic some parents attempt (hopefully with more success than Annie's parents). But the story is less entertaining than others on the same topic. I suggest Potty! by Mylo Freeman, Sara's Potty by Harriet Ziefert, or The New Potty by Mayer."
3,Nostalgia,"Consider this a Guilty Pleasure favorite. I proudly admit that I watched this movie everytime it came on HBO. OK, so the story might be lame, no Award-Winning acting, consider it a good way to pass the time. A good lazy weekend movie. It recently just came into my head that this was avaiable on DVD! Might as well grab a used copy."
3,Thirtysomething Sideout,One of my favorite 80s movies of all time. C. Thomas Howell is awesome. Peter Horton seems to shine here apart from his role on Thirtysomething. Also Courtney Thorne-Smith is here as well and hotter than ever.
4,Why not?,"Listen everyone, this is Sammys answer to Buffett and Chesney who is a friend of his, well I bet everyone is his friend and Cabo is his Party House! You cant ping Sammy for being an artist and changing his direction for a CD. This CD has some good songs for the summer and the beach, so buy it and make a compilation cd with Kenny and Jimmy and everyone else that sings about something they love, The Sun, The Beach, Cabo Wabo! If I have to listen to any beach music I dont mind hearing Sammys voice in there also. Journey did ""Baby Im a leavin you"" as a bonus track and that was pretty cool... grab a Corona and kick back, it's ok... He can still rock and will..."
2,2 stars only because it's sammy,"wow, i'm a huge sammy fan, but this is a _weak_ effor.some people have made references to jimmy buffet, wellthe world doesn't need another jimmy buffet. the worldneeds sammy to be the red rocker, not the sunburned stoner."
5,Excellent Book from tax expert,"I enjoyed this book very much, and decided to write a review when I checked out one of the other reviews regarding it. I have had a very different experience than the other reviewer. Yes, the book contains some material from his older books, but it is done in a manner that acts as a review for the new material in this book. I also had questions and they were answered when I contacted Mr. Tesser. I was not charged for the answers. I was given the opportunity to have a consult. I never felt pressured to sign up for anything and wasn't told that my current situation or representation was bad. I was shown the difference between what I had and what Mr. Tesser offered. I have gone on to become a client and I am quite happy with the service that I receive from his firm."

4,Dianetics for Wiccans,"Although the feel-good energy of the writing style often brings to mind a new-age self-help book from the mid eighties, this is a wonderful book for beginners. It's not bad for more advanced practitioners to have on hand, either - both because of the real-world advice that is given (some of which no longer applies, some of which is more timely than ever). The Frost couple use Witch Power as a catch-all description for the art of winning friends and influencing people - much of the advice is applied psychology, rather than spells and incantations - and I have never encountered better advice for new students of the craft.There is, of course, plenty of information in the spells and incantations category - most of it simple and easy to understand. I heartily recommend this book as a basic occult primer."
4,Does what it says it will do,"From some of the other reviews I read before purchasing the oral irrigator,I thought it would be more powerful than it is but it does do what it is advertised to do and is very convenient for travel. It is worth the money I spent."
4,Beatiful and colorful pictures packed in this book,"I bought this book to show my sons the nature and different kinds of animals. I am surprised at the quality of the paperback book for the price. One small thing I dont like is that the pictures are split to two pages, and in a thick paperback book, it is hard to fold them flat to see the entire picture easily."
3,the odds are crazy,"Definitely worth reading, interesting views (not the normal speed, pace, bias, trip stuff). Wish book had more on handicapping however."
1,WASTE of money. you learn nothing from it!!!!,He kept all of his secrets. If you know the basics of racing you will learn nothing. Definate thumbs down!!
4,Forever Boys Hits One out of the Ballpark,"I still play amateur baseball, and I'm in my 50s, so I can certainly relate to this book by Peter Golenbock. The author shows us what it's like for former Major Leaguers to once again put on the uniform and play professional baseball. Golenbock was right there with the players twenty years ago as they tried to recapture their glory days in the now defunct Seniors League. Many of them still retained the competitive fires from their former playing days, and despite their advanced years and maturity, petty jealousies and bruised egos are apparent on the ballfields. Older baseball fans will certainly recognize some of the players on the teams."
4,Foundation Work on the Subject,"This collection of articles is very good. I found it somewhat redundant in some respects. One might find it useful to read the first chapter and skip to the center chapters that attempt to discuss applications of the different theories, thus learning them 'in the process', rather that individualy before moving forward. The articles form the foundation of this discipline and thus provide an excellent begining for the study of the topic."
5,good value,Even with the shipping charges (a bit high)the price per pill works out to be cheaper than anywhere else I have purchased them. I like having a bottle and not having to pull pills out of all that packaging. They seem to work just fine.
1,Mediocre at best.,"The 5 star ratings are baffling. Example of the numerous ridiculous moments in the dialogue. The police officer mentions he was able to get a hard core criminal to crack and give information by spending a lot of time with the criminal. He states he held his hand frequently and even kissed the hard core criminal. Then it shows the police officer in the hospital holding the hand of the guy that murdered his daughter. He has the hand pressed against his check with affection. He is trying to build up an emotional connection with the man that murdered his daughter so the murderer will reveal the name af his accomplice. At this point i removed the dvd from the machine and tossed it in the garbage. The makers of this ridiculous junk must take the viewers for complete fools and idiots. Obviously, some of them are. Look at the reviews. Pathetic! I recentlty watched the MEL GIBSON remake. WOW! That is a great movie."
5,As brilliand today as it was over 20 years ago,"It's always a danger going back and re-watching a programme/series you enjoyed so much the first time - the years are rarely kind.This is one of those rare and pleasing examples of truly gripping TV dramas that are as watchable today as they were the very first time. Excellent story-line, great detail in production and a superb performance by all of the very talented cast.A prime example of the BBC at it's very best."
4,A Little Dated But Very Good Thriller,"I saw this within the last year and enjoyed it. However, I don't agree with all the other reviewers' five stars. In its day of 1985, I think it was a five star series. Since then we've had a lot more series, especially from the BBC, and I personally think they have gone beyond this series. For one, the device, where the father keeps seeing the ghost or semi-ghost of the daughter (we're not quite sure how much is his grief or imagination) has been used a tremendous amount since then. The basic story of how the father tries to get to the bottom of his daughter's death, is pretty interesting. She is murdered when she is returning home with him and it doesn't take long to find out she was an activist against some governmental activities. This is quite good and I think if you enjoy mysteries and thrillers, you will enjoy this."
5,"Evocative, Powerful and brilliant",I have watched this movie (series) on more than a few occasions and found it fantastic. It's not the sort of thing you can walk in to your local high street shop and buy but should be. Watch it and tell me I'm wrong... It's powerful although arms race sort of stuff!
5,Wasp - Russell,The book was in good condition as described on the web page. The shipment arrived quickly as promised.
5,Kindle version,"I'd give a 5 star review to the printed version, which I read back in the eary 1960s. I was looking forward to reading it as an ebook, but the sample I downloaded shows that the ebook version hasn't been proofread, as it contains many typos. So the ebook gets only two stars. At $10, it's a bit on the expensive side for a 50 year old book, also, but I don't give low ratings for that."
4,"Very cool, eerily prescient","The titular Wasp, would be called a ""force multiplier"" today. He's there to disrupt the enemy to overcome their numerical superiority. This is not exactly military sci-fi, though fans of such will love it. This is an honest, intellectual study of how to conduct a guerrilla campaign with minimal manpower to achieve maximum disruption. Reading this made me glad Osama bin Laden is not this smart. :)"
1,Dangerous and Cheap,"First time it worked adequately. More un-popped kernels than I would have liked, and dumping the popcorn into a bowl was a dangerous dance, trying to avoid having the extremely hot concentrator insert tumble out and burn my hand.When I tried to use it twice in a row to pop up extra for movie night, the insert melted right through the cheap plastic.Do not buy this piece of crap. You're better off using a paper bag, or just doing it in a dutch oven on the stove top."
1,Missing parts,"I returned this product the same day I received it. It's missing the ""high heat"" plastic disc that goes in the bottom, and they never sent instructions. I had to do my own research to even learn that there was a missing part. Basically, I was sent a product that was not even usable. Too bad, because it looks like it would have been a nice product."
1,Would Rate it Lower if I Could!,"Let me start off by saying that you should not buy this product. I would not recommend it to anyone. I used it for the first time today, and when I went to go check up on the popcorn 2 minutes later, none of my kernels had popped. I knew it wasn't the kernels of popcorn since I made a batch in a glass bowl yesterday and they came nice and fluffy. When the 3.5 minutes were up on my microwave, I went to take the bowl of what was supposed to be popcorn out of the microwave, and I couldn't lift the bowl. The popper had melted onto the glass rotating dish in my microwave! Now I have to see if I can find a new glass rotating plate for my microwave or see if I can somehow scrape off the plastic from the glass. Unbelievable! I would try and contact Progressive International, but they don't even contact information on their packaging. I can only imagine why!"
2,A dud,I bought this recently with the hopes of eating popcorn in a healthy manner. It leaves several kernels unpopped and if your microwave does not rotate then the popcorn burns in certain places. The popcorn also comes out a little moist and chewy.
1,Terrible waste,"I agree with all the other bad reviews, having experienced the same results of burnt corn and un-popped kernels (regardless of power settings and starting amount of corn). This piece of junk is a waste of money, popcorn, time, my patience, plastic, and landfill space. I can't believe it is still being sold on this site and at Bed Bath & Beyond."
4,The art of a good beginning,"Good art work tells the original story of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The story is similar to the movie but with the ending suggested by the television series, the burning gym. It was a fun read, a must for Buffy fans."
1,"There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between this volume and the ""Origin"" comic that the other reviews cover (namely: this one is terrible)","What a combination.Bad art plus bad dialog plus completely unnecessary characters. (Giles' niece comes to Sunnydale! She's cute and flirts with Xander but the writer seems to forget she's there sometimes, and other times makes her more important than Buffy.)The art is pretty terrible- everyone always looks like they're smiling, even when saying things like ""Oh god! There are vampires!"" etc.The plot is convoluted at best and this serves no purpose in any story line. This is actually embarassing to have associated with the generally good Buffy comics."
4,"Short version of the film, but with a new ending.","This comic is basically just a short version of the movie, but still very good. Plus it leads you into the new Buffy book, 'Sins of the father'. I think it's worth reading."
4,Works well,"I have two of these relay switches, and several X10 devices. The Insteon products work well with the X10 and even better with other Insteon devices. Overall I think the Insteon is slightly more reliable than most of the X10 devices I use. The only thing I don't like about this relay switch is the vague and cheap feel of the rocker."
3,Imax Nascar,DVC well done. Shipping less than satisfactory-requested & paid for 2 day shipping for Christmas & confirmed. Next day rec'd email that item would be shipped after Christ (no reason provided). Following an email complaint item was shipped next day mail for free! and arrived on time. Also problems occurred when attempted to play on surround sound.
4,An Aussie Review,"NASCAR - The Imax Experience was an interesting documentary giving an insight into NASCAR. It could have been a little longer, but was enjoyable."
4,"Not bad, not great","I must really commend the guys who put ""Pi"" together in that the subject matter is quite interesting. There were parts of the story that became obscured in the editing (I suspect) such as the role of the beautiful neighbor (Shekinah?) and it is never clear why our hero's double was standing opposite him on the subway platform with a bloody hand -- at that point, it became more of an self-concious artschool style film instead of focusing upon telling a story. The use of music in the film was almost a complete waste, it just did not work well. The creators needed to incubate this more, IMHO. I enjoyed the film best when it was telling a story, especially without the use of special effects.Still, it is an interesting film to see."
2,see for yourself,"Pi is a comlpex movie to say the least. The filmwork is amazing and the grainy black and white footage adds to the allure of the film. I have to say, i dont think i totally understand the movie and it left alot unanswered. Most of the movie I found myself thoroughly confused yet still really interested. It has a certain intrigue, possibly due to the outstanding acting. I wouldnt label this a mainstream movie at all, but for the slightly indie/underground audience its a film that needs to be seen."
2,Where's the science??,"I just saw the movie and was frustrated because I knew it got very favourable reviews. But I just don't see the plot of this story getting away with anything ""mind-blowing"". Seriously, if it's just about a man - who clearly has a mental disorder - trying to correlate pi with god, then ok, i'll try to watch the movie with that mindset. But all the reviews from credible critics had me convinced it was a movie about a man getting as close as possible to identifying pi with god. There's no math here, just pattern finding biases.Treat it as fantasy or a drama about mental disorders, not about some pseudo-plausible god code. Because then the math is more important than the man."
3,Ok....,This guy is a freakin wierd o! But its got some cool points for what there trying to get across. But there in lies the problem. Seems i get lost part of the way threw. More so cause the guy himself is losing base with reality at times. Hey if you put a drill to your head i think you might be losing it as well. Definitly original though. Rent before you buy would be a better thing to go with though.
