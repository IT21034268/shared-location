5,Handsome men,"Artwork is top notch. DVD plays well. Unique title menus. Killer bonus features. If you're an Awesome Show fan, you can't go wrong. Glad I bought these DVDs instead of waiting for the netflix release for all the bonus features and artwork. People that like this show are ahead of their time. Thanks Cinco"
3,good item,"I read the other reviews duh after i ordered this one. I did not have any mechanical problems with theseand they fit in my daypack for hiking nicely i like them and would reccomend them for the price, I would have likeda pair with more magnification but they cost more."
3,It's not the best.,"Pretty cheap and flimsy, and did not really fit my standard size stereo replacement. Had to customize a bit to fit my stereo by trimming around the edges. But it did it's Job."
2,This is not the band Atomic Blonde,"I was upset that this was not the band Atomic Blonde. It was just an album by a different band, and the album name is atomic blonde. I went to the band's website at www.atomicblonde.net and found out they didnt have a cd released yet"
1,Coleman 1000 watt Power Inverter,"Hi,I fully charged up a new 12 volt deep cycle battery and this inverter could not even power up a small 13"" inch tv. Pretty sad. I was able to run a small fan, or small room lights if the electricity went off. Don't waste you money if you think this unit will power up your TV. I did not try to run the inverter off my car battery with the engine running. I am going to invest in a generator. Would like to hear what others are able to run with this unit. This Coleman is more like a 300 watt inverter then a 1000 watt.WH."
3,Great book for those new to ministry,"I read this book hoping for more. It really is just a book about what youth ministry is like and it also throws some stuff in there about small churches. For me, most of what was said in the book was pretty obvious. So, while I say this wasn't the book for me, it would be a good purchase for someone completely new to ministry and at a small church."
3,xxx-treme,"Xtreme is right!!Instead of going to a mountain to smell nature, you should buy the flavor Cool Peak!!!! You will smell like a natural mountain smell. It is not better then axe but it is stronger. It lasts up to 10 HOURS. Its the best of the best"
5,"A Truly Well Written Anime, MUST HAVE!","When it aired on Adult Swim, I only saw the 1st 5-6 episodes. By then, I was hooked but had not seen all of the episodes shown due to changes in my viewing schedule. I was disappointed later when it was cut from the Saturday Anime lineup (maybe the distributors saw a larger profit if released on dvd...). A well written story of a sword fighter (female) who was given the task of protecting a young prince who was to be sacrificed by his father due to a water spirit within the boy.A must have for those who love anime, as well as a well written one!!"
1,Animeaholic,"Well i buy tons of anime.. and thought this would be a deal for the unBEATable price. But i guess you get what you pay for.. The actual series is amazing love it ... But the cheep packaging will lead to scratched disks (since they are stacked one on top of another, with nothing to put in between) and the video quality is grainy... I have a brand new TV and HDMI cable with and HD dvd player and the transition through out the dvd has tiny lines that do not go away.. And I have purchased other anime before using Amazon. This is a first for me dont know what to do with my bunk collection.... Sad really."
4,really nice saw,"i would have given this saw 5 stars if it had a soft start , kicks a bit due to the large blade and powerful motor . it's a bit lighter than my 10"" makita slider and has really substantial cutting capacity . i had considered buying the new makita 12"" slider as my second saw but the price was prohibitive and most of my cutting doesn't require that capacity , this was a nice balance between cost, weight , and capacity . would certainly buy again."
5,One of my new favorite books,"I bought this book a few months ago and recievd within about 4 days. I was SUPER excited to read it, and it did not dissapoint. It was cute and funny and sweet and sexy and heartwarming and i dont care if this is a run-on sentence, I LOVED THIS BOOK. Willa seemed like a very deep and well thought out character, Paula Boock did a remarkable job."
3,the Kindle edition,"I might have enjoyed this book a lot more if I had not been so distracted by the typographical errors in the Kindle edition. It appeared to have been scanned for Kindle by an OCR program, and then nobody bothered to proofread it afterward. Louie became Lome and rain became ram, and the punctuation was all messed up, among other annoyances.But I liked the story."
2,"GREAT product, BAD seller","This tea tastes great - has a hint of blueberry flavor, and it really does what it says - it helps curb your appetite. I usually have one in the morning (between breakfast and lunch) and one in the afternoon (between lunch and dinner). I have found that my snacking has decreased drastically on days when I'm drinking this tea.I can't give the product a stellar review, however, because it comes from a bad seller. I had this on auto-renew and selected the ""every 3 months"" option. From the first shipment to the second shipment, there was a 40% markup on the product. With the markup, it's not worthwhile to keep buying it on Amazon - I can get it for the same price in my local Whole Foods.Due to this very poor business practice, I have cancelled my ""subscription"" of this product. Buyer beware."
3,No changes,"This tea tastes good, but I did not have any slimming effects from this. This may have worked for others, but it did not work for me. What has worked is eliminating wheat from my diet. Check out Wheat Belly and see if that will help. This was not the answer for me."
1,Oh my....,"I like the taste of the tea but it is very hard on my digestive system! I have tried it twice now (for several days) and it completely upsets the balance, won't go into detail but you get the picture! As soon as I stop drinking it (2c. a day, 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening) I am fine. There must be something in it that I cannot tolerate. I bought the case....I never have trouble with any other tea! :("
5,Yum,"Love the blueberry slimming tea. It tastes great to me, but I love tea. It would probably taste like dirty blueberry water to those that don't."
4,Secret Garden,"I was looking for something a little different, and purchased the CD primarily because I enjoyed the story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful! The music is a delight. This CD is one of my favorite musicals."
2,What Happened?,"I got season one from a friend as a gift and loved it. I bought season two and was pretty dissappointed. The show just became vulgar and sacrificed the hilarity of season one. I loved the ideas for episodes, but didn't care much for how they played out. Bill got soft. Cuddles and Dan got mean. Buttons and Rocko stayed about the same, but it wasn't enough. Great show, but stick with season one."
5,Carmen Electra's Amazing Aerobic Striptease Collection,"Carmen Electra is amazing and does an outstanding job in her Aerobic Striptease Collection.She really targets areas that help to tone and stretch the body; as you aerobically strip your way to becoming fit!I give her fitness collection a rate of ten stars!If you want to learn how to strip and get fit the right way; then you have to puchase Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease collection !Nicolette and Myrna ""We are so glad we got this collection!"""
2,Carmen had nothing to do with this except smiling,"This DVD was a joke. There were two dance routines and in the end they lasted only about a minute each.The fit to strip one had some good workout moves, but the collection in general is a waste. Carmen looked bored doing the moves which didn't help and there wasn't much dancing involved."
5,Great purchase,"This collection is a great addition to my current workout routine. They are fun, so its not like workout at all. Plus I learned some new moves. Its choreographed by the creator of the Pussycat Dolls. I loved these so much that I purchased Carmen's newer releases not incuded in this set"
2,not my style unfortunately,"The product is well done, it's just not my style.In short.. I could NOT see me getting my man excited if I were dancing most of these moves."
3,Ok....,"I love the first dvd in this set and the 2nd one. I find that there are too many pauses in between each portion though. I like that I can select which section to do and be able to change the music. But I am going to start doing it twice because my body has gotten used to it! I do not like that the routines are so short! But overall the 1st and 2nd dvd are the best, I don't even bother with the others, they are too short and it doesn't seem like a good workout to me! I'm just trying to get rid of an extra 10 pounds, so I rotate between this set and Denise Austin with cardio! Overall the dvd's are good, I like that she is different and makes exercising fun! :) Hope that helps."
3,Better than Expected,"I thought it was a strip tease workout, when it actually is just a full-body workout, no strip moves. I thought Carmen should have lead the routine but she has some other bloak leading and she just works out alongside of him. But, you can definitely see the results, especially for your butt! Good beginner work out. Might try the next DVD in the series to get a more advanced workout."
5,Great Workout,"I like that it is a combination of workouts. It gives you good dance moves, a good toning section(disc #2), and it makes you feel good and sexy while doing the dances. I am very pleased with the set. This DVD and a few others have helped me to lose almost 25 pounds in the last 6 months. Thanks Carmen!"
5,Fit to Strip,I love this disc! The workouts are challenging but not so hard that you dread doing them. The workouts are not related to stripping at all but rather make you stand up straighter and more able to do alot of the hip movements in the first disc. Micheal Carson is really informative and gives great tips while you are sweating!
2,Should be 2 disk series.........,Disk 1 - 4 starsDisk 2 - 5 starsYou do not need the following:Disk 3 - 3 starsDisk 4 - 2 starsDisk 5 - 1 star
2,Wow...workout video?,"I thought that the words ""workout video"" were for, ahem, *workout* videos -- and this one does NOT appear to qualify. It is great if you want to learn a dance routine and then dance the heck out of it. But, for one, the dance routine seems to take a while to get through (a practice round ensues first) and then you get to actually dance regular speed. I fast forwarded through the practice round myself and never bothered to do the dance full-speed. I'm not sure if there's a workout beyond that, but I lost my patience enough to even find out.I thought the fact that this DVD was the first one would necessitate that it be a real workout, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Go for the second DVD instead. Michael Carson is in that one and does a good job of creating a series of good workouts, short and longer."
2,1/3rd of the dance - nothing without the others,Carmen Electra's collection is necessary to get the whole dace routine. 1 is worthless by itself.
3,It is not as good as I thought it would be,"The dances in the video were not as challenging as I thought they would be. However, the work outs are pretty hard if one hasn't worked out in a while."
5,great for beginners,"This is a great workout for beginners or for people who want a low-impact aerobics workout. The routines are fun while challenging and they are easy to learn! This is the kind of workout that will make you feel better about yourself, learn some new things, and something that you will WANT to do!Be prepared: if you don't do some form of exericse on a regular basis, you WILL be SORE for 2-3 days after starting this dvd. This is an amazing workout for your hips, butt and legs...and you will feel it!!"
5,really great workout,"This is challenging and fun to do. One of the best workouts on dvd I've ever used, and I own plenty. Great job."
4,Allot of Fun!!,My friend and I have been doing this workout for a couple of weeks now and we REALLY enjoy getting together and working out now. It takes a couple of times to get it down but once you do you can have allot of fun with it. If you lover to dance but never get the chance to do it...this is the workout for you!
2,Good Only Once,"I own loads of work out videos and this is not a work out video...if you are doing very basic aerobic activity this might work for you but only you have learned the two dances (the first is only a warm up) you've pretty much exhausted the dvd. If you want to learn to strip tease I would defiantly recomend buying this, but if you want a work out try something more along the lines of Jennifer Galardi's 10 min solutions dance work out."
3,It's Alright,I bought this dvd thinking it was going to show in detail how to striptease and give you a great workout. But it was more like a watered down version of a striptease it doesn't really give you a workout and it spends so much time going through the walkthrough that if your a quick learner you will get bored easily and fastfoward to the runthrough but then you would cheat yourself out of a workout. You would be better off turning on some music and trying to dance sexy in the mirror.
4,Not that bad!!,well I actually enjoyed this one better than the Dirty Dancing workout.I would recommend it!
2,Hmm not so much,If you are so out of shape this is a work out. If you are moderatly fit then this will do nothing for you. Not really my favorite. :(
4,Carmen Electra is Dumb,"These videos would be really great if Carmen Electra would keep her mouth shut. I'm glad that I have multiple options in my work out video selection, I would stop working out if I had to listen to her everytime I wanted to work out. The videos really provide an excellent challange for the body, and I feel like I'm accomplishing something when I do them. But Carmen sometimes stares into the camera like a lost puppy, and then she acts like she can't do the easiest of the excersies. I think they should have told her that mostly women would be using this collection and she didn't have to put on her sex act for the men... it's gross."
3,Try not to feel silly....,"Make sure you close your blinds and that no one can see you the first time you try this DVD....you will feel extremely silly and uncoordinated. I can't see this being a very good workout - for if you want to lose weight - but it does provide you with a little something extra outside of your normal routine - and you will break a bit of a sweat. It will get a little bit more fun as you practice - and of course, you can put your own spin on it!"
2,Not much of a workout,"I was hoping this would be a better workout, but its not...its a very easy pace once you know the routine, and its certainly not long enough. I did learn a few cool moves though, but it didn't get my heart rate up."
3,"good striptease, not a great workout","i learned some really great moves from the dvds but as far as actually getting a workout in, it didn't make me sweat enough. i also agree with past reviews about it being sort of a waste to have so many dvds. i know it sells better but they really could have put all five on about two dvds. i would definitely recommend this series if you are wanting to learn to strip, but if you want to burn any amount of calories go for something a little harder."
2,Carmen's hot but the video was NOT,The instructions were simple... too simple. Anyone can learn these moves just by going to a club and watching other people. I was really disappointed when I watched it. I thought she would add a lot of UMPF not just OOMPF. Her sensual expressions were a lot more effective than her moves imo.
1,NOT WORTH IT,I bought the bloody dvd set and it is the worst thing I have ever bought. It gives no credence wha has been promoted about it. It has no substance and completely a waste of time. I would rather work one the old Cindy Crawford Videos compared to this.
2,Kind of Lame,"I got this for my girlfriend because she enjoyed the first video, but this one had next to nothing interesting, new, or challenging.After she told me that she hated it, I figured that I might as well watch it(Carmen Electra is one of the hottest actresses in the world, IMHO), but I was even disappointed. It looked like Electra put on 15 pounds since the last video, and her outfits were boring."
5,Feeling sexy,I love these workout dvd's. They are definitely a good addition to my existing exercise routine. My favorite part of the workout is that it makes me feel sexy while I'm toning my muscles. I have been sore the day after I do these routines in places that I have not worked out in years. I do each routine more than once since they are short and it gives me a better workout.
2,waste of time and money,"This ""workout"" is not at all intense. Plus, you have to listen to the silly dialoque which is basically Carmen's trainer saying ""can you feel this Carmen?"" and Carmen saying ""Oh, yes, I can really feel this one!""I thought this would be a good tape because it was so popular but I was really disappointed. Go for Jane Fonda or the 8 minute workout series instead."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Carmen Electra's Fit to Strip was not at all what I had expected. I thought it would teach me how to strip, sexy moves to try out on my husband, but it doesn't. It is an aerobic workout to condition your body for strpping. It was too long and slow moving."
4,Work your body and feel sexy at the same time!,"Good points: This workout was a lot of fun! I loved how it worked my body and made me feel sexy at the same time. The routines are simple but work all your trouble spots, hips, butt, and thighs. I also found that the floor moves will help me with my flexibility. I loved that the moves were the same that strippers actually do.Not so good points: It didn't get 5 stars because the routines are a bit short. I think it would have been great if Carmen had combined the two routines into one dance at the end. I also wasn't crazy about the music.Overall this workout is something I will do regularly."
5,OOOooohh so sexy,I am just starting to exercise to these videos (bought the entire set) and I feel sexy even though I don't look sexy yet. After my workout I smile all day long & glide through the day. they do use muscles I haven't used in awhile even though I exercise to TurboJam. A Must Have as far as I'm concerned. I don't care if anyone else thinks I'm sexy. I like feeling that way to myself.
5,Very Impressed,I was not sure what to expect from this DVD but I am glad I purchased it. Carmen goes at a great pace; even uncoordinated people like me can get the hang of it. I am never sore from this DVD but I know I am getting a workout while doing it. There is not one thing I would change about it. I recommend it to anyone who wants to feel sexy while getting in shape!
1,thumbs down,i was very dissapointed.......i thought i was goin g to learn how to strip in this video.......the title is very misleading...i would have bought a reg workout vid if i wanted to to regular exercise.....derrr
4,Liked the Christmas Fireplace,We had it playing when we opened presents on Christmas Eve. It was nice. The grandkids thought it was cool
5,Worth owning!,"I've been looking for a dvd like this for ever. I've been taking intro/intermediate ballet classes in professional studios for a couple of years and have some background in gymnastics. I've been looking for a dvd, which would give me a feeling of being in a real class. This dvd does it. Instructions are clear and the class is well-paced. Both sides are covered - so you don't need to rewind to repeat the other side. Overall very professional and easy to follow. Also loved the advanced class."
3,A solid support for a lightweight story.,"Lupica's ability as a sportswriter serve him well in this slightly odd and occasionally humorous look at the NFL. Lupica excels at exposing the current state of the game with its out of control players and the bizarre world they inhabit. The thinly veiled references to current celebrities and players is fun to read, but the story itself,about a prodigal sun taking over his father's franchise, is not particularly intriguing and the ending is extremely predictable. A good page turner for the beach or the plane, but not something that will stick with you."
1,Lupica owes royalties to Dan Jenkins.,"It's pretty clear what happened here: Lupica read Jenkins, thought it was great stuff, and decided he could do the same thing. The similarities are legion, right down to the endless stream of nicknames like ""White Trash"", ""ATM"", ""Second Story"", etc. And to include a scene such as the one in which the Italian place-kicker reverts to his soccer roots and heads a pass into the end zone makes one wonder exactly where Lupica intended his book to fall on the humor scale: Satire? Farce? Who knows? This book is equivalent to the so-called ""teen"" movies in its sophistication level."
1,lack of imagination,"I have two of Lupica's books, acquired after seeing him touted on the Don Imlus show. This one I got through the other one I had to quit. His writing style bothers me in that his character development, plot and story line are mediocre to poor. ..."
1,"Cynical, vulgar, and crude","Lupica celebrates what's wrong with sports. If this is meant to be genuine satire (ie, aims a reform), it fails."
3,Good but i was expecting a fiction.,well written amd interesting but had the feel of a non fictional account. this is the first Ann Rule book I read so not sure if this is her normal style or her other books are more of the traditional sensationalised fiction novels Im used to. worth reading though.
5,Ann Rule,"As usual, MsRule has written a factual crime book, an easy read. You just don't want to put it down!"
3,Adequate,"Typical Ann Rule biases and opinions dot the presentation. Victims are presented as almost saintly and she chooses to ignore the fact that early investigators could have done more.Rule even tosses out a missing person in another part of the country at the end of this book and tries to link the killer in this book to her, which, if anyone is familiar with that case, knows is incredibly off-the-wall.But, this book seems to have been well researched and is an interesting read."
3,chilton 2006 diagnostic manual,"Although this says 2006, I assumed it was for 2006 model vehicles.. In fact it is not. The manual is revised in 2006... the book is OK, covers a lot of territory but not specific for the 2006 model year which is much different than the 2004/05 model years"
4,Not very deep but enjoyable enough,The Bottom Line:La Ronde consists of a series of romantic vignettes that tell a short story about love before moving on to the next set of characters; the merry-go-round of stories and characters fits together nicely at the end and I was pleased I watched this slight but fun piece of entertainment.3/4
2,Save Your Money and Wait Until Technology is Perfected,"The CableCard technology in the Tivo Series 3 still have a lot of bugs - I ended up needing to return mine because my cable company was unable to get the cable card slots to pick up anything except analog channels (no digital, no premium, and no HD). Without this capability, what's the point of upgrading from my Series 2? There are tons of posts in Tivo support forums about the lack of compatibility between the Series 3 and major cable providers (like Time Warner, Comcast, etc). Great technology in theory, but not quite ready for prime time just yet. This is one case where being an early adopter isn't worth it."
5,TIVO USED WITHOUT TV CONNECTION,"I purchased the unit for organizing my videos and connecting to utube. I have directtv service so I cant use the tv options. I now have all my audio, video and music files stored on the unit. Access has never been easier.It does a perfect job and with the $200 discount well worth the money. All my media is organized perfectly."
1,"Unreliable. One unit died after 1.5yrs, another after 9 months.","Multiple units have proven unreliable. We ordered this product and transferred an old lifetime service (for $150 tranfer fee) to this machine. The hard drive died in about a year and a half. Tivo replaced with a refurb. model (for ~$100 fee) and transferred lifetime service. New unit lasted about 8 months and Tivo now (as of 5/09) charges a $200 ""transfer fee"" for lifetime service that they will not waive (plus $49 +s/h for the replacement unit), even though the reason for the transfer is a substandard product. Have been very happy and long-term Tivo customer (have 3 other non-Series 3 units in the house) until now, but are switching the Tivo HD DVR to a DVR provided by our cable provider. Tivo sells an unreliable product that breaks down in <2 years and has the audacity to charge the customer additional fees to obtain the same service on the same unreliable product. Disappointing."
1,False claims on networking,"I purchased a series 3, one reason was the purported Ethernet connection. I turns out that what they claim to be a Ethernet connections has restrictions. It must be hard wired directly to the router. I have a wireless network that handles traffic everyday, but a TIVO will not connect. Tivo second level support says even if I get it to once it will fail and fail often, I need to purchase the Tivo wireless device, for more money. This is blatant false advertisement, Tivo knows there series 3 will not work on wireless home networks but does not say so."
1,Buying this device is crazy...,"If you have a cable operator that offers a high def DVR like the Scientific Atlanta 8300 HD. 160 gig hard drive, no need for a cable card PLUS the navigator program guide, all for $6.95 a month lease. And you can plug in an eSata drive like the Seagate 300 gig drive (for under $200) and have a huge storage capacity. Both Dish and Direct TV have similar units for their services."
1,Why Pay $650 for something I can get from my Cable Provider for $8 a month?,"I am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are! I really did enjoy the ease of Tivo from Pre-HD days and wanted to go back from my Comcast HD DVR. I then saw the pricetag and, unlike the other people... I can NOT justify spending that much money for a DVR! It is definitely not worth it for something I get for $8 extra a month attached to my cable service. Yes... i do love the Tivo interface and searching, but I will not pay that much for it. It feels like business suicide for Tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price. Knock $700 dollars off that retail price and I might change my mind."
4,Weevils to take up the Mother's mantle,"Bay area vets Beanweevils offer up this carefully crafted piece with a freshness and skill commensurate with their collective experience. Combining Andy Partridge-like songcraft with acidic commentary on the San Fran scene, The Beans' deliver a sugar coated slap shot right between the eyes. Wish more bands would take the time to bring their work to this level of polish."
1,Just plain dumb.,"It's funny to see the positive reviews here for this lame album striking a blow against being ""PC"". This album doesn't even warrant that kind of argument. The Beanweevils just fail to produce anything enjoyable in all their attempts to be satirical. The music is bland, the singing annoying and the lyrics some of the worst ever written by anyone, anywhere. They'll probably sell a couple copies due to all the bad reviews here, but at least the CDs will make a good paperweight."
3,Good back-up seat,"We bought this seat for our son's grandparents, so that we no longer have to carry a car seat on the airplane when we visit them. Its a perfectly serviceable seat, but doesn't seem quite as secure or comfortable as our Britax. I think its a good back-up or occasional seat, but wouldn't want to use it every day."
2,Not the quality we expected,"We ordered this seat online because it wasn't available at stores in our area. We received the seat today and I was not impressed at all. The seatbelt guides are attached to the fabric, not the actual seat and seem flimsy to me. Also, the padding for the seat is quite minimal- I couldn't imagine having to sit in it for more than a few minutes. The hard plastic is easily felt through the cover. I like the look of this seat, but in this case looks were deceiving. We will be returning this one for one that looks a little more sturdy."
5,excellent book,"the top 10 guides are the greatest books for traveling. they give the top 10 of everything you would like to know-sights, resturants, hotels. we traveled through europe and book several different types of books and the top 10 were our favorites! some of the info is a little off like the hours of the collsium and the prices of somethings so i would confirm"
5,Still crazy after all these years,I am enjoying this CD now as much as when I got the LP when it was new way back when. Pretty close to timeless.
2,Fair,A putrescent pool of ignomonious...Perhaps you should read A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin instead! Good Idea!!These books blow all other fantasy into fire and brimstone.1. A Game of Thrones(1996)2. A Clash of Kings(1998)3. A Storm of Swords(2000)4. A Feast for Crows(TBA)5. TBA6. TBA7. TBA
4,How can this still be free?,"I load up on several free title every week or so. Then, a month or two later I check the reviews to see if I might be interested in reading.'One Fall' is a nicely done little novel; not literary, but certainly not trash. If you want to take a little escape, an interesting story line and characters that you can connect with, try this one. It is a winner."
5,A masterpiece of simplicity,"Prevert's words leave you spinning as if you know where he is, what he looks at, what he's thinking. He describes his world in such a manner...that the reader has no choice. His Blood and Feathers volume is just as good."
4,French postwar poetry bilingual edition,"Reading these poems - especially the longer poems - one can easily see why Ferlinghetti was attracted to these poems - there is a significant overlap of poetic sensibilities with those of the beatniks. The opposition of Prevert to war and religion is highly visible but generally not strident. Prevert's use of repetition, the ordinariness of his observations create a very accessible poetry.As an example ""Flowers and Wreathes"" explores thought in the image of flower, the pull of beauty and pleasure over reality etc. The poem ends with the following use of repetition: ""Because / In their head / Sprouts the sacred flower / The thin little filthy flower / The sick flower / The bitter flower ..."""
3,"Read his other two books, they're better","I was waiting with great anticipation for Pattison's latest book to be published and I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed. This story just didn't have the edge of the seat gripping feel to it. With his other books, I couldn't put them down, wanting to know what would happen next. With this book some of that magic was unfortunately lost. Having said that, there are very few books with stories based in Tibet, so for that I am still drawn to his books. If you're looking for a different kind of murder/mystery or are an Asiaphile, Pattison is it."
5,A Well Layered Book,This book is like an onion which makes you think not cry as you read it. A mystery thats telling.
2,A Very Weak Effort From a Fine Writer,"Too long, too convoluted and too many characters. I enjoyed The Skull Mantra very much but the series may be played out. There are simply too many implausible turns in this book, too many coincidences to be believable. Plus, I'm a bit weary of having the cruelty and perfidy of the Chinese thrown at me on every page. I know it's all true and actually much worse than what is portrayed but the repitition is tiresome. I think I'll skip Beautiful Ghosts."
4,Another lesson in Tibetan culture doubling as a political thriller and mystery,"I really enjoy Pattison's Inspector Shan series novels because they work on several levels. First, they educate the reader about Tibetan culture. Second, they are intriguing mysteries. And, third, they are a damning indictment of the Chinese oppression of Tibet. In all cases, Tibetan culture forms the backbone of the mystery. In order to accomplish this, Pattison displays a masterful understanding of Tibetan culture and Buddhism (which are one and the same)."
4,good pudding,I am from Scotland and know black pudding. This is the the best I have found here in the USA. It is very much like a Scottish pudding. In my experience If you are looking for an English type black pudding this may not be for you. That said try it you should not be disappointed.
1,Mr. Kidder you have written better!!,"I loved Mr. Kidder's book entitled Among SchoolChildren and Old Friends. He captures the classroom perfectly and two friends in a nursing home with great depth of emotion. However, I would not even believe that Hometown was written by the same man!!! He has too many characters in this book and his plot jumps from one thing to another in order to give us a bird's eye view of small town life. I grew up in a small town and thought I would really enjoy his latest effort. Instead, I found it a real effort to get to the conclusion of the book. I was so glad when it was done!!! I would not even give this book to my worst enemy. I wish I could get my money back!!"
3,"""Hamps"" Beat ""Nohoes"" in TKO","Tracy Kidder had a great gimmick going in ""Hometown."" He saw Northampton, Massachusetts, as a town divided between two factions: the ""Hamps"" are the original townies, the old homeowners, the radio listeners, the political establishment, the stay-at-homes. ""Noho"" describes those who came from afar: the younger, more gentry, more yuppie, more liberal, more affluent, more rootless, more in sympathy with Smith College contingent. Kidder establishes this dichotomy, runs with it for a while . . . and then drops it. He spends too much time cruising around time with one policeman, and the book suffers as a result. Sorry, but I didn't see the patient craftsmanship here that I saw in THE SOUL OF A NEW MACHINE. What could have been an outstanding book is merely a good one."
2,A series of disconnected anecdotes,"If I wanted a travelogue describing the life and history of Northampton, MA, this would fit the bill. But this is the only sense in which this book makes sense. It is a disjointed series of editorials about eccentric personalities, some of which are mildly entertaining or amusing or sad, but none of which seem to have any relevance to anything other than the fact that the people described are residents of Northampton. I thought there was going to be a continued storyline about a cop accused of child molestation, but even that did not have adequate follow-through, and the story as described (even if it was based on a true story) did not ring true, but that may have been due to the lack of continuity and the capsule style of writing in which each chapter is a little capsule of life in Northampton. I would have to be either very attached to or personally interested in the town of Northampton to have found this book worthy of my time and attention."
2,Voyeurism isn't literature.,"When an author watches other people, then puts intimite details of their lives in print, isn't this simply the written act of a peeping Tom? I find it interesting that Kidder doesn't write about himself at all. I wonder how he'd like being cast as the central character in someone else's book."
3,"the package looks great & the pads touch great, just that","I buy this in order to follow Chizu Saeki's habit for a Japanese flawless skin (it's fun). The whole pack is big, paper pack (but one end of the pack is opened & has a white tape sticked on, that's a bit annoying). And the pad is smooth, light and seems to be elastic. Can't wait to try it tonight.( After trying): It's not very elastic & good in staying on my face as well as in Saeki's instruction clip, but not too bad though."
5,An Indispensable Book for the Serious Writer,"I've read this book cover to cover once and dipped into it on average once a month over the ten years since I first found it. It sits on my shelf with my other ""correctives"", such as Orwell's ""Politics and the English Language"". Fischer makes the same points about rhetoric as Orwell at greater length and with far more wit. But, Orwell is the better writer.Yes, as one reviewer says, Fischer rants a bit, but amusingly and with dead-on quotations from his victims. One will think twice about the errors Fischer cites, if for no other reason than to avoid Fischer's next edition.Fischer is quite even handed. The first felon he cites was a professor of mine -- and Fischer's -- as an undergraduate. A more generous critic and historian -- and human being -- one won't find. But there he is.I cannot think of a better gift for anyone who takes persuasive prose seriously. No writer should be without it."
4,Excellent book but should be read thoughtfully,"This is an excellent book. Will try not to be repetitious. As a reader you should be mindful about Mr. F assumptions. Mr. F is an empiricist and this greatly affects his characterization of some of the fallacies. Mr. F is fallacious by his own standards in this respect. The other assumption that undergirds his work is pluralism. I do thank Mr. F for accepting the idea that in order for some of these fallacies to exist you have to make certain assumptions(in his conclusion). I would simply caution readers to not be persuaded on all accounts; some of his fallacies are also dependent upon a worldview. In spite of these comments, Mr. F deserves praise for his work."
4,Great Set of Workouts!!,"I was looking for a workout that I could do in between the days I run and train (I work out quite a bit, but wanted to switch things up). I thought this set was just going to be a fun fill in. It's fun, but it's more than a fill in - it's a butt kicker! I was worried about the length of the workouts, but I have to tell you, I had so much fun even though it was tough, it felt like the time flew by. I am always one up for a tough workout, and let me tell you, Stephanie and the other trainers deliver! I can already tell a difference in my endurance and I look forward to each butt kicking."
5,Crazy good,Real people. Excellent variety to keep all parts working. Live these. Sure ate better than the high priced stuff. Just as effective at a fraction of the proce.
5,Love it!,"I've owned work out videos before and have always been disappointed because they were either way too easy or much too difficult for where I was at the time. I love X Train Fit because Stephanie has multiple levels for you to work at. The work out isn't too fast paced or confusing and after just a couple days you can tell it's working. Stephanie and her crew are down to earth, fun, and are the kind of people you don't want to punch in the face for looking amazing while you attempt to keep up with them. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an at home work out."
2,Too much talk,"The instructor talks too much. By the time she's done explaining how to do something, my body was already cooled down."
2,Back to the early 90s,"Poor quality video. The woman leading the training is so awful to listen to, you need to put it on mute!"
5,Solid Workout,"One of the reviewers said this workout was too easy; the only thing I can say about that is , get your butt off the coach & then it's not easy. This is a solid, no frills workout. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good workout that will give results; if the effort is put forth. You get what you put in. If you do the workouts every day, you will see & feel the results."
2,disappointed,"Although I find the exercise moves very effective, I think there is too much delay between moves. The instructor is longwinded explaining each move. I find that she often repeats herself while explaining these moves. I also find her very unprofessional. She says things (trying to be funny) that, to me, are inapropriate. She can be very annoying!I am not too impressed with these workouts."
1,Incredible Red Sox play off games and World Series! Bogus DVD set,"Why aren't these games preserved in their original recording quality?!? One of the main reason I enjoy my HDTV is because the sports broadcasts. I remember these games were broadcast in HDTV. Why the recording quality of this DVD set is below even sub par is beyond my comprehension. I've never been more disappointed in a DVD set than I am in this one. The games are so distorted on my HDTV that I can't stand watching them. These are games to treasure and to watch over and over and over again. Unfortunately I won't be able to do that with this DVD set. Beside the quality of the recording, I was disappointed in how much the games were edited down for ""time."" Some of the games are clearly more compressed to save room on the discs than others. It should have been expanded to another disc if time was such an issue."
3,happy,Im happy with the content but not the packaging. The box was ripped in two spots which as a collectors addition made it look sloppy. But overall Im happy with the content of the videos. This was a gift and I was alittle upset that the box the videos came in was in poor shape but the recipent didnt seem to mind.
5,"A ""must have"" for true Red Sox fans","What true, long suffering, Red Sox fan wouldn't want to have this DVD collection? It's amazing to be able to relive the ALCS and World Series with every COMPLETE game on DVD. The agony (losing the first three games to the Yankees) and the ecstasy (THE STEAL, Big Papi's walkoff hits, the game 7 romp, and of course, the World Series SWEEP !!It's all here.....how can you NOT buy this?"
2,quality is unacceptable.,"I watched the original games in 2004 on an HDTV. I figured the DVD set released a year later would have been cut from the original HD broadcasts I saw, not worse quality than the original standard def. broadcast! I should have just left the games on my DVR.I would have been okay with switching discs before the 5th innings. At least then, I could have hope that an HD-DVD version would eventually come out with full games on each disc. At least my memory of the games isn't yet as fuzzy as these recordings."
5,Just as SWEET as SUGAR.....,"I read SUGAR when it first came out and absolutely loved it. I did finish the book really wanting to know what happened to her and more about her. THIS BITTER EARTH answered a LOT of questions about SUGAR and it was (as SUGAR was) a very good book. For those who loved SUGAR, do yourself a favor and read this novel. You won't be disappointed. I am looking forward to COF II reading it soon. Bernice McFadden is definitely one of my favorite authors."
4,This Bitter Earth,"Mind stimulating capturing the attention on each page. Finds the characters mainly soft and tender of heart such as human nature, one that is destructive. Hateful of self and others. One just does not want to put it down before finishig the entire book"
2,It was alright... I guess,"I really didn't care too much for ""Sugar"" but I finished it just so I can get to ""This Bitter Earth"" (The conclusion to ""Sugar""). I bought them at the same time thinking they were going to be good. ""This Bitter Earth"" was short and sweet and to the point though. I don't think the title fit the book though."
5,A must-have for latin pop lovers.,"If you like Aterciopelados, you must have this cd. Gozo Poderoso is the highest point (up to now) in the evolution of these colombian rockers. You will find a mature group with great and new sounds, great lyrics and the best music they have ever produced. You will love songs like El Album, Rompecabezas and Gozo Poderoso.For those who have never heard Aterciopelados, and you love latin music, it worth it to take the risk and get this record. You will love it."
2,New To Cynster And Found It Boring,"I have never read any of the Cynster series and found this book rather boring. There isn't much plot, and what there is goes at an excessively slow pace. Maybe if I were a Cynster fan, I would find more to enjoy in it!"
1,Disappointing - SPOILER ALERT,"This is my first Stephanie Laurens' book and after having read reviews here that Sebastian is unfaithful to Helena after only a few years of marriage,I think it will be my only one. I can understand how people who have read the other books in the Cynster series could not get into this book. How could you believe this book knowing that info beforehand?"
2,honestly could not finish this book,"Honestly, it's been years, but this is one of very few romance novels that I started and could not finish. Like others, I was a devoted fan of the Cynster series and knew about the illegitimate child/affair that would occur later on (and I didn't buy the he-felt-sorry-for-this-Scottish-woman-and-had-sex-with-her story).I remember liking the book and the characters in general, but it was constantly nagging me in the back of my mind that the ""hero"" would have an affair down the line in derogation of the passionate love being proclaimed in this novel. Eventually I couldn't read anymore . . . I just felt horrible for Helena and couldn't view Sebastian with anything but doubt and skepticism (all I could think was LIAR).And I totally agree with others - I wish the hero and heroine had been any other couple rather than Helena and Sebastian (then I could have enjoyed it)."
2,I also couldn't get past Sebastian's future infidelity.,"Based on Stephanie Laurens' descriptions of Sebastian and his feelings for Helena, there is NO way he would have cheated. It made the whole story very unbelievable and, frankly, not anything I cared to finish. I stopped about 3/4 of the way through before I just couldn't do it anymore. :)I cannot recommend this book to anyone looking for a good romance."
5,Nirvana on the flats,"If you are looking for good information that might help you prepare for a bone-fishing trip, look elsewhere, if you want to reinforce why you are going... buy this DVD. The photography and scenery is of the highest quality. Watching two fishing legends, working together to get a fly down to the ""big bonefish"" simultaneously raises my heart rate and lowers my blood pressure. My family gave me grief over the per-minute cost of the video compared with commercial film at half the price and six time the length. I will still be enjoying this DVD when Transformers XV is grossing a billion dollars."
3,Good but not great yet,"Version 2 is better then the first go at it. The pen is bulky, and does not fit in a pocket. There is not way to know how full the pen is.....All in all.... I use it for meetings each week. I have bought a few as gifts for others."
1,Pen Is Not New,"These pens are not ""new"". They have been out of production for some time. If you buy one understand that ""new"" is being described as ""unused."" The following is a direct quote from the seller who sent me one that didn't even work when it arrived and refused a refund: ""Please also remember that Logitech does not produce these products anymore. It has been produced long time ago. Without use over years, the batteries' holding capacity might have been degraded significantly."" That's right. Every one of these that you buy is already old with the battery capacity as described by this seller(after the purchase)!"
5,"Not What You Expect, More Than You Imagine",The purpose of this pen seems to be converting handwriting to text. My opinion on that is it is breaking technology and the only consumer software I can find to do it is the software included with the pen. It requires
5,Excellent reference for the professional,"OK yes this is a professional text, written for the professional, not the layman. I do not know why anyone would expect otherwise. Dr. Johnson is the acknowledged dean of Canine Theriogenology, and this is her classic tome on the subject. Written in 2001, it is becoming a tiny bit dated, but is still without doubt the definitive book on the subject, and any reproductive practicioner would find their library lacking without this reference. For the GP or ordinary Vet student, maybe not of interest, this is a specialist's book. Probably the most utilized book in my collection, along with Small Animal Surgery."
5,Glutino gluten-free Pretzels,These are great. They are just like a regular pretzel. It's so wonderful to eat something that is like you used to eat.
5,Good Simple Pretzel,"These are good pretzels. They are simple and light. All of my kids have enjoyed them too. They are maybe a little more lighter than your regular pretzels but that is not a bad thing, we have enjoyed them."
5,Best Pretzels EVER!,"The fact that these pretzels are gluten free is a bonus for sure! I, we...everyone I've had taste them agrees they are better than any pretzel we've ever had."
2,"Potato-y taste, bad texture","In my opinion these are a poor substitute for a ""real"" pretzel. They have a potato-y taste and an odd texture. They're crunchy when you first bite into them. Then they quickly dissolve; not very quickly, just more quickly than ""real"" pretzels.So far Snyder's gluten free pretzels are the closest thing to ""real"" pretzels I have tried yet. I just wish they were made in twists."
5,"A classic of ""imperial Earth"" scifi","Gordon Dickson has often been under-rated. This book,Naked to the Stars (1961), is one of his stronger novels.The challenges of ""first contact"" and the tension between the""military"" and ""diplomatic"" approaches are quite good, and very relevant to current challenges facing the US around the world. (I would have liked a ""third"" party -- a marketer/mercantile agent to have played as well.) Main characters are interesting, main character matures during the course of the story, and there are a few good twists to keep things interesting as well."
4,Get Real,"The price is so LOW because it's good for only 1 car! What were you people thinking? Shop's pay Thousands of dollars for this info for whatever car they need. Your paying a Subscription for 1 car. At under $20 for 4 years, it's a steal. How about instead you take your car to a Shop to get it worked on and maybe pay 100 times more! This is better then one of them Books. Far more Information."
1,Just buy a Haynes or Chilton manual,"I bought the service to work on my son's 1983 RX-7. We already had the basic chilton and haynes manuals purchased through an auto parts store. I was hoping for something more detailed with torque specs, disassembly order and more pictures. We were dropping the transmission to put in a clutch kit and replace a bad pilot bearing. What I got was really just a reprint of the less than stunning haynes and chilton manuals, much of it not even specific to the RX-7. We got the job done in spite of a lack of good information. If this is the way all there e-manuals are, just buy a book at autozone and forget the annual fee silliness."
4,mitchell 1 review,"Having worked in a garage that had mitchell on demand I decided to try the eautorepair mitchell1 erepair manual. I knew it was for one car only and find that ok as it is a very well written and easy to navigate shop manual for more experienced mechanics. For $15.oo you get the single vehicle service manual for four years, about the price or a Haynes or chilton. It breaks down repairs very well and had the wireing diagrams I really needed and had trouble shooting schematics I use. I recommended this to any one needing a better shop manual readily at parts stores."
5,Fabulous book to get started!,"I just thumbed through this book in the store and decided to grab it because of the wide scope of information it covered. When I got it home, I read through it more attentively and found a wealth of information on how to get started making unique and remarkable jewelry, well beyond stringing beads! The author covers first the tools, even ways to make your own to start out with to save on start up costs. He then goes into materials. Then starts with an introduction into some very basic processes (like soldering, polishing, etc.). And from then on, introduces techniques and tricks in the form of creative projects. He even talks a bit about the design process and gives tips on things that have helped him (keeping a design journal and a scrapbook of pieces that inspire you).Fabulous book! I would recommend it as a perfect starting point to anyone looking to begin artisan jewelry making!"
1,HATE THIS BOOK!!! HATE!,"This is by far the most unsympethetic and unlikeable character in literary history. I just hated her, she was a spoiled narcissist who has a thing for guns and married men. this was just a terrible terrible book."
3,Very weird......but I liked it!!!!!,"""High Maintenance"" was ok. Andrew was a total psychopath and I only wish that Liv had seen that from day one. I had to laugh at Dale....what a trip....and soooooo honest. Liv was a bit messed up from the start and never did quite find her place....but all-in-all I think it was a pretty good read. I'm going to dig into ""Going Down"" next!!!!"
3,High Maintenance!,"Liv Kellerman, daughter to famous designer Peter Kellerman, is trying to find her new life after she and her husband split and she is left not having a clue where she fits in life. She won't call her father so she finds herself in a terrible apartment, with no job and no money. After a strange job as an assistant to a blind man with whom she has a bizarre chemistry, she eventually decides to go into real estate, passes the exam and is hired by a small company run by a lesbian who falls in love with her. She leaves to find a new agency and begins to rebuild her life.While some of the characters in this book are quirky enough to summon a few giggles, the plot is fairly tedious and shallow as Liv finds herself defining her life and everyone in it by their apartments and real estate and she misses her ex-apartment much more than her ex-husband.Recommended as fluff to read on a plane or in the car on your next trip."
3,"Definitely not ""hilarious.""","...In fact, far from it. I had already read Going Down, since it had come highly recommended by my friends and by Amazon readers. Going Down is even less funny than High Maintenance. Don't get me wrong-- you should read these books because it is obvious that Jennifer Belle is sharply intelligent. Some of her phrases and metaphors are really eye-catching. But there is a DARKNESS to it that is almost depressing. I think it is hard to overlook that when I'm trying to find a book funny. I am just saying that if you're looking for humor, this is not the place to look."
2,"Not funny, just dysfunctional",This book portrays itself as a hilarious romp about a young NYC divorcee finding herself. Really all she finds is a spectacularly creepy boyfriend who is clearly in need of a restraining order. I found it more disturbing than entertaining.
4,Quick and Inspiring,"Although some would describe the heroine of this story a spoiled brat who wants to think of herself as not one, this book proves itself to be a almost realistic tale that many people can at least enjoy even if they cannot personally relate. The protagnist speaks to the dissatisfaction everyone feels at some point and how she resolves her dissatisfaction. I read it in two nights and didn't feel it was a waste.Good summer read."
4,Clever and Hilarious,"This book was a great ""travel read""! It was easy to pick up and and put down...a good laugh every couple of pages. Very ""New Yorkie""."
4,It made me laugh out loud...,"This book is very funny and very black. Ms. Belle's unique and profound sarcastic comments are non-stop. If you like Sex in the City and have fond memories of Tama Janowitz this may be for you. It made me laugh out loud all day on the beach yesterday. I have not read Going Down, but now I'm looking forward to it."
2,Disappointing,"I read Belle's first book Going Down several years ago and really enjoyed it. I found it scuzzy, raunchy, and amusing. I definitely recommend that book in favor of this one though. This book fell flat. I kept hoping it would get better but it doesn't....it's just not very good...the plot is dull and the chapters don't propel the story with intrigue."
4,Great Product,I just purchased this for my son. He is a rough 5 year old and I did not want to waste money buying him a mp3 player that he would tear up in five minutes. I think the problem stated in some reviews about the foam falling off of the headphones has been solved. The foam on the one I purchased could not be pulled off with simple use. It would take some real effort to get it off. I did not have a problem with the software and took the time to set up songs in advance. I love that it is kid tough and that the volume is not loud. Great product for the little one.
2,"Only compatible with FP accessories, downloads, VERY LIMITED","Caution: The FP3 player is NOT compatible with anything BUT FP accessories. That means you cannot use an iDog or any other external sound devices except those made by FP (which are over priced and hard to find). Further, you cannot use music from your personal collection or CDs and you cannot use files downloaded from the Net EXCEPT those from the FP site. This is very limiting and expensive-- esp if your child likes variety. Skip the FP3 and get a Cool P3 player by Tek Nek, you won't be disappointed. We returnedout FP3 and went with the Cool P3 and have been extremely happy with it's kid-tough design, compatiblity and ease of use for both parents (set up) and kids (usage)."
3,Good but insanely proprietary,"Pros: Rugged, great battery life, headphones aren't too loud.Cons: Crazy proprietary FP3 software, CAN'T DOWNLOAD THE PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE TO TRANSFER FILES!It really is a decent product, but that last CON has really gotten me upset. Our son received this as a gift last year for his b-day. He likes it but was getting tired of the pre-loaded songs. So, I was going to add some more for him tonight. Of course, I can't find the CD anywhere. No biggie, right? I'll just download it. Well, you can't. At least I couldn't find it anywhere on their site this past hour. I did find reference to the fact that you have to use the serial number on the disk to install. So it sounds like I need to get a new disk. Of course, I can't find any place to order a new disk on their web site either.Bottom line, this is a good product, but you might want to consider a 'real' MP3 player that doesn't depend on a proprietary format or proprietary software."
5,Wonderful!,"What a simple life inspiring book. The 10 Paradoxical Commandments are simple and life affirming. This is a must have for anyone who is looking for their own personal meaning in this life of uncertainty. In ten simple statements, this author represents the best in us and you don't even have to read the book just the commandments to get his entire meaning and self-reflection in your world."
5,Useful travel guid book for visiting New England,"It is a very Useful travel guid book for visiting New England, detail description of scenic routes and beautiful illustration and photographs."
2,Only Average,A disappointing book with no more real insight on how to build a brand than is available elsewhere. That Mr. Bedbury was instrumental in developing both Nike and Starbucks brands is beyond dispute. However I found little in the way of advice for small corporations that do not have the marketing spend that Mr. Bedbury obviously had at his disposal when heading up the marketing departments of said companies. Furthermore I found his frequent criticism of the second most respected company in the world (Microsoft) a little tiresome as the book went on.I agree with the previous reader - I thought the book was more aimed at a marketing tool for his consultancy business - i.e. give the readers (including prospective clients) some information but not so much as to enable them to act on their own.
4,TEC Plus 3 wood,"Good product. Am very pleased with quality. Like any club, Will need to use it more often. Have only been able to swing it a few times but am happy with the performance. Was here at my door within 5 days. Vendor was honest and forthwright. Everything as advertised."
3,Not as helpful as expected,"The focus of this book is definately school aged children. Most of the suggestions, while helpful, are primarily focused towards school and school related tasks. The book would be great for teachers and parents of elementary or secondary school children with SDI, but for those parents of toddlers or preschoolers with SDI may want to look towards another source."
1,Not Happy With Elation T4,"The order was received in a very timely manner.This product does NOT perform as described.1. Even with the speaker close to the microphone, lights do not come close to keeping time with the music. The instructions state the sensitivity is factory set but adjustable...it's not.2. Within the first 15 minutes of use, the third channel quit working. Lights plugged into the third channel stayed on continuously regardless of control switch position.Compared to other light control units I've had, this one simply sucks. I've returned it to Amazon for a refund."
2,Too Close To The Falla,"Did not like this book. The one good aspect was it took you back to the days when you were young, when T.V. first was developed and Ed Sullivan, howdy doodie but the story never really developed fully. It was slow moving with very little to keep your interest. Glad to be finished reading."
5,PHIL COLLINS SERIOUSLY LIVE,"I,VE OWNED A COPY SINCE EARLY 9O,S AND I THINK THIS IS ONEOF PHIL,S REALLY GOOD CONCERTS. THE BEARDED GUITAR PLAYERIS DIFFERENT, AND IN A CONCERT RECENTLY I NOTICED HE WAS THEREIN THE BACKGROUND. PHIL KEEPS HIS VERY LARGE GERMAN AUDIENCEWELL ENTERTAINED AND READS TO THEM IN GERMAN. THE BLACK LADYSINGER IN THE BACKUP VOCALS IS VERY GOOD AND HAS A EXCELLANTVOICE. THIS IS A VERY GOOD MUSIC VIDEO FOR PHIL COLLINS FANS.YOU,LL ENJOY PHIL AND THE MUSIC. I,VE WORN MY COPY OUT!!!!YOURS DON , MO"
2,"Nice design, but too much statics","I tried many FM receivers, none of them really worked well, just way to much statics and makes ipod heard unbearable"
2,:(,I do have to apologize. I was not too happy with my purchase of this book. Illustrations were porrly drawn and distracted me from appreciating the written content.
3,Bad news right off,Meter was poorly packed and came with no leads or manual.Will add later after I try it out.
3,Get what you pay for,"Haven't had any real problems with this meter. It's got idiot lights and buzzes if you have your probes in the wrong ports. Even though it's rated to CAT III, the continuity buzzer (or buzzer in general) is 100% worthless in any environment with noise (ie. industrial). The backlight would be nice if there was a way to make it stay on; all it does is light up for under 10 seconds. The auto-ranging isn't bad, but if you're not paying close attention you'll get some odd readings. Sometimes it'll read 0.000V then start spitting out randomly increasing mV readings. I paid just under $30 so I can't expect Fluke quality for 1/10th of the price."
1,High Frequency Problem,The meter has a hard time measuring AC voltage over 10khz. It will measure the freq. but at high freq. the amplitude is off. Stay away if you are a student.
1,If I could I wouldn't give a star,I really tried to like this book. One because I had spent money on it and two because I had really enjoyed the books by Cheryl Richardson. This book is no where near those of Cheryl Ruchardson. I totally got lost and didn't feel like I could help myself.
5,A great book with substance!,This well written book offers practical steps for getting your life in order and taking action. Ms. Fortgang focuses your attention on the future and helps you determine what you really want to accomplish in your life and career. It is meaty - no fluff!
2,bare root Peony,Japanese peonies are very hard to find. I have two purchased locally quite a few years back with stunning blossoms in the spring. But I have tried planting bare root versions in the same area with absolutely no luck. They don't grow. Neither did this one.
5,Great gift for griller in your family,I saw this advertised on TV last year and ordered one as part of my husband's Christmas. Everyone teased him when they saw the Happy Hooker name on the box but this has been on of his favorite gifts from last year. He loves it and uses it all the time. It doesn't matter if it's on the stove or the grill. We'll be getting some more of these for gifts again this year.
2,Slips in slot,"This adapter is not secure in the mitre slot, because it has only one expansion slot/bolt. It needs two -- one at each end. My homemade adapters are oak, have a securing slot/bolt at each end, and are more secure than this Bench Dog device."
4,Man in pursuit of Truth,"This Cd from Chris is one of a personal journey with the Lord. Chris looks at all aspects of his life in regards to his relationship with God. One song is about his mother and sibling dying at a young age and feeling guilty asking the Lord for them back. You can not go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy writing that flows from personal experieces, and quests for Gods love."
5,excellent resource for treatment options info,"I bought another book that gave a thorough explanation about menopause and it's symptoms, but this book did an excellent job of covering the many treatment options available. The alternative treatments were covered in this book better than any other information I have read. In spite of all the menopause treatment web sites, books, & articles I have been reading for 2 years, I was not aware of the effects phytoestrogens have on women who have not had a hysterectomy. This is something more women need to be aware of!"
5,Excellent resource,"I too have purchesed the newer books on MVPS, but I keep coming back to this one. This is the only book out there written by a professional with lots of years experience. I think the word has gotten out about her research and we all look forward to Dr. Scordo's results. This book is an excellent resource and is loaded with very useful information. I agree with the other reviewer you said it is their Bible! When I get scared, I reread what she suggests to do--works everytime."
5,Great Book! Best Buy!,"I can't agree enough with all the others that wrote about this book. It is awesome and loaded with information. Easy to read, loaded with useful information and lots of references if you want more information. This is without a doubt must reading for all those with MVP!"
4,it's mainly all about american market,"Wonderful shipping! In just one month, so they've hit their earliest estimates ;)I come from Europe..:90% of products enlisted in the tables are not existing in Europe.Always have to use the oz -> liter/kilo converter (sometimes not even knowing, if it's a liquid or solid material)Otherwise, the books is a wonderful reference!However, on the [...] I still was not confirmed as a member to dateStay healthy!"
5,For Every Reader of WWII History!,"Field Marshal Milch's eyewitness account of major events and personalities, including A.H., is priceless and unequalled. Author and honest, non-PC history-researcher David Irving has created another masterpiece of an absorbing read.Field Marshal Milch supplies great material on the background of the V-1, V-2, and jets. The late-war production increases of aircraft arranged by Milch's own efforts, under the extreme war circumstances, are phenomenal to read about! The constant struggle for labor from various sources is excellent historical material seldom found laid out this way in other sources.""He suddenly tore the field marshal's baton from his hands and began raining blows on the back of Milch's skull"" ... is how the section on his capture by the Allies begins."
1,wasted download,This is just a Table of Contents and first lines only. I found out only by downloading.
5,Great summary book!,"""Meet the Sasquatch"" is a great summary of most of what's known about the Sasquatch phenomenon to date. It is a good compilation of ""classic"" stories, native American lore and many types of evidence. The pictures are fantastic and the book is jammed with them. Anyone who is a fan of the genre will not find a lot of new information that hasn't been published before, but there are some very interesting tidbits, and a lot of new information on the people who have done the most compelling research through the years, with many personal anecdotes from the author and his interactions with them. I highly recommend the book, especially for those who are just getting into the story of Sasquatch and want to be brought up to date quickly and in an entertaining fashion."
3,good but far from great,"the optic quality is good and it seat great on the face. Also the lanes work very good in the sun and and dusk and dawn (we have a very strong sun here where I live). Also ventilation while riding is very good. Also you have many nice accessories such as the strap and the sweat bar. All these are the positive things, but there are few serious issues with these -1. The temples have axis to them that allow the temples to rotate, the thing is after some time is start rotating all the time2. the temples are very fragile - I broke one when I placed it inside my backpack and when I took it out it broke very easily - too easy3. Customer support (at least in the US) is terrible for them. I try to contact them about the issues I have and never got any replybottom line - you can find better than this"
4,Nearly perfect,"This set had one very big ommission. The song ""Simple"" from 1984, which is very hard to find. I really wish it had been included."
4,"Good show, flat sound","Sheryl Crow is captivating as ever. Visually, this is a great DVD for seeing her perform. But the sound is flat.I bought this DVD after renting it from Netflix and the rented version sounds much better through my stereo only system, it has more sparkle and has more ""air"" around the instruments and vocals. The DVD I purchased from Amazon sounds compressed. It appears this version dated 2011 has Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS. The rented version dated 2004 has Dolby Stereo 2.0 and 2.1.Don't let it put you off buying this DVD, it is a good concert, but I am going to try and find the 2004 version from somewhere."
4,"Nice product , but ad should be more specific","Very nice mural , but the description by the seller says it is 6 panels . They should be more specific , it is a wall paper roll that you have to cut off the 6 sections from the roll .. I had no problem because I am a handy person with tons of experience . I had to hang this on panel boards because are walls have heavy knockdown .. It has to be installed on a smooth surface"
4,The 'Flesh return to thier ol'school groove...,"""Hymns""picks up from where ""Song of Love & Hate""ended and does it better this time around using drummer Ted Parsons. Broadrick seems to be over his drum'n'bass/breakbeat phase that was blatant on ""Us & Them"" and has graciously returned to the rock. ""White Flag"",""Antihuman"" and ""Paralyzed"" stand out in my mind as well as the hidden track at the end of ""Jesu"",where Broadrick actually attempts to sing instead of his signature bark'n'roar. It looks like Godflesh has matured yet still retains all its ultra-heavy groove to sate the die-hard fans and hopefully draft some new ones,what with everyone thinking the heaviest thing out there of late is Linkin Park or Disturbed.Still,as brilliant and sharp ""Hymns""is,thier ""Streetcleaner""LP is STILL the thier watermark and all-time best album. Run,don't walk,and get this CD double-time!"
2,Business Business and Business,"I was expecting backstage stories and details about his arguments with Roz Russell and his insatiable lust for starlets.I suppose I was looking for a grood sloppy Hollywood tell-all.What I got was something entirely cerbral and concerned with mergers and wheelings and dealings of the studios going back to the Nickolodeon days.If you are an accountant, you'll love it. If your looking to get to know Harry Cohn....forget it."
2,A Black Queen,i am tired of people of trying to make cleopatra and egyptians not black they are just affraid that 2 roman rulers fell for a beautiful BLACK queen. that's a shame
2,only one good song!,"My 20 month old loves mickey mouse clubhouse, so I didn't hesitate to buy this cd. However, the only good song on it is the hotdog song. There are all sorts of wierd songs that are not on the show and my son couldn't care less about them. Take mine, please!"
1,Piece of junk,"Total waste of money. Belts easily tangle, adjustment is harder than a jigsaw puzzle. Never buy one like it again."
2,Not the same,"I purchased the original Genius and Comapany and adore it! I thought this CD would be as nice but I was disappointed. Although Ray Charles' voice is engineered to be a bit stronger on this one, the overall product was a letdown."
1,Skip it.....,"This album feels like what it is - an artificial studio creation.Not a terrible thing per se, but not something that makes for a decent album, either.You are warned!"
2,"Info is good, format is not","We go to europe every year and i always get fodor or frommer guides to the city we are going. this was my first time using a time out guide and it was a mistake. the format of the book is really hard to use. not easy to find anything. the whole 'map in the back' set up makes it hard to go back and fourth. the info was good, but both me and my partner did not find it easy to access it."
4,wonderful,great great song writing loved 80% of this double cd. i'd give anything to have seen her live. ron
3,"Good, but a little boring in the beginning","This book was good.The beginning of the story was boring. As usual with connie , you have the sizzling scenes of affection. I for one am glad it did not take long to reveal the plot of the story, and how these to strong individuals came together. I was facinated with the starlett of the book, and how strong her character was in the book. I was however a little tired of the cat and mouse game , that the character of books played with each us, but this is fiction."
4,Learn me something quick.,I would also ask The Walkmen to teach me correct grammar and spelling. Who reads the Rolling Stones to learn about good new music anyway? Maybe they should just run another Britney Spears cover and change their name to Almost Naked Post Celebrities.
1,also have problems,"I just got this mandolin and was very excited to use it. After reading the reviews, I read the manual, examined the whole thing and carefully put it together. I got mushy slices when I was able to get a slice. I tried a lime, a bell pepper and a sweet potato. The blades do seem a little dull. I took it out and tried slicing paper with it - it sliced it but not as easily as I expect brand new 'very sharp' blades to do. But I think there's a problem with the safety handle: how do I hold the food down so it makes a firm slice? The pins won't hold the food. I tried it without the safety handle (not recommended) and was able to slice the items. Maybe mine is defective, maybe I'm not using it correctly, I don't know. But if I can't figure it out, I'm returning it.By the way, the product is made in China, not France."
1,Great if you're really into food shavings,"I had the same experience as many of the reviewers here. This ""slicer"" is totally useless. If you put ANY kind of pressure down on the item to be sliced it will not cut through; otherwise you just get shavings. I have tried an onion, a green pepper, and a sweet potato; none of them were cut. The video from the company demonstrating this product (up on a certain popular tube site) is a gross misrepresentation, this thing just got tossed into the trash."
1,Mediocre at Best,"Very sturdy, compact to store, and easy to load blades, but...I shredded one carrot and the plastic had peeled away from the blade! The French may know a lot about gourmet cuisine, but stick to German brands when it comes to knives and slicers."
1,Buy a Borner V-slicer instead,I purchased this model of mandoline at Costco to replace a 10 year old Borner V-slicer. The blade is incredibly dull. The food guide/holder requires a great deal of force to be applied to hold the food down on the mandoline. It is a setup that is almost guaranteed to cause a major kitchen accident. The Borner V-slicer is a better buy -- much cheaper and a joy to use.
1,Too much trouble! Dull blades!,"This slicer is terrible. My sister gave it to me for Christmas and so I gave her my old cheap one...Now I'm stuck with this thing that can't cut anything very well. I tried a simple julienne (this was no problem on my old cheap-o slicer) and ended up with a pile of uneven and broken carrots! It's too bad they didn't put better blades on this since everything else (thickness adjustment, fold out legs) is really well designed."
4,Item is sturdy and blades are sharp.,My wife loves this item. I bought it for her b-day about two months ago and she has used it many times already. She absolutely loves it. I have not seen or heard her complain yet about many of the issues that some comments have suggested. The blades are sharp and the Mandoline is rigid and does not slide around when cutting foods. For me it was a very good purchase. We are happy with this item.
2,An elementary text,"I'd love to give this book two ratings. I thought that it did a good job of empowering the reader and introducing basic concepts in leadership. If that was what I was looking for, it'd get 5 stars. Unfortunately, I was hoping for something a good deal more advanced and found little that was useful to me. This isn't really a ringing criticism, since no book can reach all levels of need simultaneously. If you're relatively new to leadership, this is a good book. If you're very experienced, look elsewhere."
4,Blast from the past,"Very good movie...just the way I remembered It. Last time I saw this movie was in 2001. I enjoyed the erotic ""different"" plot of the movie. It was along the same line as ""Two Moon Junction"" and ""Red Shoe Diaries."" A very nice, ""pour a glass of wine, put on something more comfortable"" type of movie."
1,BAD,THIS RADIO DOES NOT WORK SO WELL. WE BOUGHT IT A WHILE BACK TO USE AT THE BEACH. THE VOLUME IS SO LOW U CAANT HEAR IT
5,History for real.,"Published when few books detailed German experiences during WW2, this is an objective, well-written account of a POW who wasn't content to sit out the war. Read it in thelate '50s and again in the 2000s, and enjoyed it all over again. Very enjoyable read."
1,Metal madness!,"If you're looking for machine-gun double bass, dual, shredding guitars, twisted solos and growls and screams that make your hair stand up on end, or if you're just a fan of laid-back classic metal, then you've come to the wrong place. This is nu metal, and in nu metal you don't have any of those things! This singer in particular is particularly bad. He struggles to croak out those not-so-high notes and basically sounds like he has baby squirrel nuts.Anyhow, if you want some real metal you'll have to look elsewhere. This is Trapt and the only thing these guys do right is play with each other's trouser snakes."
5,Awesome Group!,"I just discovered this group over the weekend after hearing ""Headstrong"" on the radio. I thought they had a good sound. Then I was listening to the ""Someone In Control"" CD and I got to the 4th track and it was all over for me. The song ""Stand Up"" is such an incredibly powerful song. I just fell in love with it. I highly recommend this group if you are a fan of heavy guitars."
1,Buzzing noise warrants review,"I used this product for about a year and didn't have initial success. It never turned off the other devices when my TV (Master) went off. I didn't think much of it and since it was buried behind my entertainment center, I didn't bother with it. I moved recently and plugged it in at my new house and noticed the adjustment feature so I started playing with and viola, it started working as I thought it should.On Saturday morning (approx. 6 weeks after the move) I came downstairs to this terrible, shrieking, buzzing sound. I had to turn the adjustment knob all the way down to get the buzzing to stop and now the ""auto shut off ports"" don't work at all - regardless of whether the Master device is on or off. The device must've broken overnight.These folks are off my list of reputable companies."
5,Francis J. Roberts review of London~Jesus Jones,"This album, released in August of 2001, is a much awaited upbeat shift in the lyrical pondering that Jesus Jones is known for. Rather than a totally grim evaluation of humanity's spiritual tendencies which seemed to color most of their previous album, 'Already', 'London' seems to be a sort of lightening up for them. Not like they are avoiding important issues, but rather, that they are ocassionally more OK with just putting out some good, solid, entertaining and fun dance tracks as well. Hopefully this a sign of even better things to come in future albums from digital rock Electronica pioneers Jesus Jones."
3,the best is yet to come,"It's true, this book is not the best LP has to offer, with somewhat pedantic, bone-dry descriptions and overly-detailed town histories your average traveler could care less about. It still offers your basic traveler's information, though, and you won't miss much with this complete tome in your hot little hands.A promise, however: the next edition will arrive spicier and cutting-edge fresh, with beefed up entertainment sections and wittier town introductions to boot. It will also be more fun to read (same goes for the Buenos Aires guide). I personally guarantee it."
5,This heating pad is great!,"Ordered this after receiving moist heat therapy during recovery from total knee replacement surgery. I like the ability to ""pause/resume"" the heat on the control switch to manage the amount of heat. Also great for use on upper neck/shoulder area to release tension."
1,"Pain in shoulder, Pain in arm and now a pain in the Neck!!!!","I ordered a specific heating unit that would address the arthritic pain that I have in my arm and shoulder. It stated on the box: For Arthritis Joint/Pain. When the item arrived, I was not sent the item that I order but was instead sent a heating pad for my back. I called customer service and was told that I would be sent the correct item that I ordered. The item arrived in a timely fashion and I was elated that I could finally attend to the pain in my should and arm. Oh but it was not to be!!! They sent me the exact same INCORRECT ITEM again. So suffice it to say that I still have the pain in my shoulder and arm and now I have to add the pain in my neck that I have developed because I have to now repack a second box and send it back!!!!!!"
3,TSA marked it fragile,"We recently purchased 4 of these locks in May 2012 to use with our new luggage. When we returned from our first trip with these locks, the TSA had wrapped a orange tag with the word FRAGILE around one of the locks from the bottom. It appears they opened the lock and had trouble re-locking it...but it was locked. I removed it from the luggage and will replace it, but with a different lock.The only complaint I have to this lock is, the dial is out in the open on the lock case. I could see how it could be easily damaged from bumps and mishandling. I purchased several locks a few years ago that have the dials inside the lock case. I prefer those locks to this one."
1,Review of Amazon services,The order for this item was cancelled quickly by Amazon for some reason. Then when I tried to find out why there was no delivery the vendor stated that Amazon had never placed the order with them. This is really incomprehensible. This complete order has been a very time consuming debacle. It has made me doubt seriously if I will ever order anything from Amazon again. TERRIBLE SERVICE!
5,A Richer Mind........,"Delving deep into her own psyche and experience, Ms. Burton pulls off a major coup with Rich Minds, Rich Rewards in the highly competitive motivational/personal enrichment field. Clearly and succinctly, Ms. Burton puts us on the path to personal fulfillment by guiding us through some of her own personal trials and tribulations. All the while, encouraging readers to ponder the parallels with their own lives.Ms. Burton actually comes across as good friend who while candidly exposing intimate details, patiently and painstakingly explains those important lessons that are sometimes lost in the process of everyday living.Someone once said, ""Never confuse motion with action"". Ms. Burton is a living testament to those words as to what you can accomplish by never ceasing and creating a life of fulfillment, joy and spiritual well being for yourself."
1,Disappointment,"There are better books on the market if you are seeking self-improvement advice. The book is basically a collection of her personal experience and self-given pats on the back, rather than examples of several individuals' experiences.Try reading ""7 Habits."" For the money, it's a better choice."
1,Quality,The black light did not work and The vendor never responded to my email regarding my request to return the merchandise. This is the first bad experience I have had ordering on line.
5,Outstanding Collection of TV Themes,"You get some really impressive British and American TV themes here. Who ever thought you would get Ron Grainer's theme for MAN IN A SUITCASE or Edwin Astley's THE BARON on a CD? Astonishingly they are here with such classic TV themes as John Barry's THE PERSUADERS, Dimitri Tiomkin's RAWHIDE, Edwin Astley's THE SAINT and Laurie Johnson's THE AVENGERS. You also get some very good obscurities as Edwin Astley's DEPARTMENT S and Brian Dee's RETURN OF THE SAINT. There are many more."
3,Excellent Film!,"I saw the Missing Brendan DVD and Adam Brodyís acting was excellent, very different than what you would think. He falls in love with this girl while his family is looking for his missing brother from Vietnam. It was a very touching story."
5,Great Tool Pouch for Satellite or Alarm Techs,"I have been using this pouch for 10 months now as a Satellite TV Installer. It has maintained its shape and is just the right size for smaller hand tools like wire cutters, stripers, screwdrivers, etc. The handle on top of the pouch is great for grabbing to get the belt around your waist and it doesn't get in the way. The material is tough and has stood up to alot of abuse in the back of the van and around the job. The included belt is just a bonus and I would have bought the pouch without it."
2,top broke after a while,"the plastic lining that makes the lid airtight fell off after about 8mos-1year. I was handwashing it only, and not very often as I used it for storing flour. Very disappointed in this. I have other much more durable equivalent products that cost about the same. It still closes, so I still use it for storage, just not like I wanted to."
2,Beautiful but with an Achilles heel,"I love the look of this canister. Sitting on my counter, keeping my coffee beans dry and fresh. Aesthetically it's extremely gratifying. Functionally however, it leaves something to be desired. Closing the canister top takes a few tries every time to be sure the lid is lining up correctly with the cannister, otherwise the lid sits funny. Also the tab to lock the lid in place is extremely flimsy and if you push too hard on it, will bend leading me to believe that it will soon snap off leaving me with a jagged edge my thumb will enjoy trying to push down to seal the lid. SO that's exciting."
5,A Necessary Supplement,"Jumper's Answer Key provides what has been lacking for decades. As Alger Johns's Grammar has been an excellent resource for the study of biblical Aramaic, it offers the student helpful exercises without a full explanation of the answers. That is where Jumper meets the reader's need. By offering answers to Johns's exercises along with thorough annotations, he provides information which is invaluable to the student desiring a full explanation of the methods for interpretation of each exercise. The cross-referencing to Johns's book is very useful. One text should not be used without the other!"
2,extremely overpriced,"The yeast was made in Mexico and did not have any USE BY date on it. After I got it, I realized that I could have purchased 4 pouches for $13.68. I was going to send it back, but the postage was $6.50, so I figured that I might as well keep it and try it. It seems to work well, but I have also ordered the 4 pack."
3,Pretty good yeast,It's small and granular and makes your bread rise. There's quite a lot of it here too. I'm not sure how I'm ever going to use it all up making two loaves of bread a week.
4,overpriced,I agree that this is agreat product.But I got it at King Arthur flour co.for $5.99 per pound.
2,Dog loved it...smells like a dead animal,"Yes, my dog loved this thing for the day we let him have it. However, the smell of dead animal that wafted from my dogs breath and the bone was absolutely putrid. He was a wee bit sad when I threw that smelly bone in the garbage. Love most of Merrick's products that I tried so far. Go for the Texas Taffy, and the bones that are hollow."
1,Garbage,"I can't believe somebody would invest so much time and energy simply to display some bad opposition to authority. I feel sorry for the moronic mope who would pay money to read trash like this, and even sorrier for the author, who obviously does not know what the term ""adjusted"" means. If you spent a quarter of the time and energy it takes to fight the Police to actually help them and yourself in the process, you would be amazed at the results. But, since there will always be ridiculously stupid people in the world who must villify the men and women who spend, and lose their lives to help these very authors, I guess these books will always be around. Too bad."
4,"I like it, will be getting more!","A friend turned me on to this CD and I REALLY like it. I hear a lot of Incubus and Faith No More in them (especially track 3!!) but many other influences are in there as well. Definitely one of the better CDs I have been turned on to in the last year or so. Heck - I'd even go as far as to say it's the best new music I've heard since I was turned on to Porcupine Tree!!In fact I like it so much I'm gonna go into the reviews and see what the consensus is on the next best release (or better) of theirs is, I WANT MORE!!!!And, as for the 4 stars, sorry guys but not having heard anything else by them and reserving 5 stars for the best of the best, regardless of genre, not just a bands' best work, I couldn't quite give it 5 stars."
2,Tough Impulse Buy,"I purchased these on a Black Friday Week Deal. Thought it was a great buy, but you get what you pay for. Fuzzy images, and impossible to focus above about 15x. Just wish I had read all the reviews before jumping at an inferior product. My 30-year-old Bushnells are a much better product. I will never buy another Barska product. Avoid."
3,Barska 10-30 zoom binoc,"Good item for the price, however above 20 power the image gets a little fuzzy."
2,Not helpful at all,"This video is poorly produced, it looks like they didn't even bother editing after they taped it. The guy seemd nice, but he is very scattered in his desciptions of the swing. Not worth it."
4,gun treatmentr2,Very easy to use product that does two things at once. This is a miracle product. Was sent super fast.
2,"Longing, historical fiction","I found the book to be overly wordy, although I enjoyed the historical aspect, I felt that I did not know the meaning of almost fifty percent of the vocabulary. The constant name dropping of famous composers, painters, and artists, who had no real relevance to the story, was slightly irritating. The book did improve by the last quarter, however, but the first three fourths were a plod."
4,"A striking work, but not over the top","I picked up this book in the library and thought, ""hey, a historical novel about the Schumanns, how cool is this?"" However, despite how cool the main characters were, it was wayyyyy too meaty for my taste. While I could normally finish this book in maybe two sittings, it took me almost two weeks to actually finish it, because despite how interesting the plot was, it got boring. There was so much to be said, and too little time to say it. The musical history was far from boring, nor were the character's commentaries on each other's work. However, the way it was structured, it was just a bit too detailed for my taste. However, this is the first book I have read by Landis and I believe I shall be looking for more as of this point on."
2,A word on stability. ..,"The main component of this product is Pressed cardboard glued together that is about 1/8 of an inch thick. The ""Metal"" that covers the exterior is actually plastic that is painted silver to look like an aluminum case. This case is ok, but any direct blow will probably crack the case which will potentially allow your console to be destroyed."
2,not very good,"i got this for christmas and i thaught it would be good, but it wasnt. it doesnt have space for the power suply for the 360. it also broke after a couple of weeks. but i did use it alot"
5,awesome,Good price n great condition and all arrived timely manner the only complaint is the plastic bin the movie in just have to. Be careful at handle otherwise all is awonderful deal
5,Building a great show from the ground up,"I resisted getting interested in the ""other"" C.S.I. shows even though I had always been a fan of the original. I still haven't become enamored with C.S.I. NY, but I have to admit C.S.I. Miami has me hooked. David Caruso's Horatio Caine is both decent and fair while remaining a hardened cop. That is a delicate balance difficult to pull off, especially in one hour episodes, but he accomplishes it with aplomb. I recommend this series to anyone interested in the genre. Looking forward to watching Season 3!"
5,My back says Thanks!!,"I purchase this item because my regular nail apron kept sliding down my hips and it hurt my back. I tried just getting suspenders for my old apron, but it didn't feel right. This apron is great I can wear it all day on a job and my back doesn't hurt and I am able to carry everything I need. Because of the material that the tool belt is made from, it wears like clothing instead of like a regular tool belt."
4,"Nice collection, with two exceptions","Watching ""Live at Daryl's House"" gave me a whole new appreciation for Daryl Hall's voice. I ordered this CD after watching three or four episodes, and overall, it's a good collection. I really wish, however, that it included ""Wait For Me"" and ""Every Time You Go Away"". Still, it's nice to have many other Hall and Oates songs that I remember, especially ""Out of Touch"", ""One on One"" and ""I Can't Go For That"". If you're looking for a decent greatest hits collection, this fits the bill."
3,Nothing New Here,"Most of these songs were featured on previous Hall and Oates greatest hits CDs. Plus, there was nothing new offered. If you are a Hall and Oates fan and don't have this music on a previous CD, then you would enjoy it. Otherwise, there is nothing new here."
5,Only for the hits,"Their hits are 80s gold -- probably gold records -- but the rest is likely only for true fans. I'm not among those, but the hits are worth it.Watch out, boy, she'll chew you up!"
2,Did not sound good,"I did not like sound, tinney, I would not suggest to buy and look for a better deal ok ok"
5,~Can't stop singing~Maneater~,"My beautiful daughter gave this CD to me as an early Mother's Day gift,she said it reminded her of a time of driving and singing and just having a great time! I believe I've already worn the thing out. Playing it over and over again to recapture those carefree days of the ""80's"".The worst part is..........I can't stop singing....Maneater! I hadn't thought about Hall and Oates since forever and as soon as I put the CD into my car, I couldn't get enough. This is just the ticket for someone in need of a little nostalgia and just plain good music!"
2,Could use better typesetting for accessibility.,"I don't think I need glasses I regularly print documents at 75% and keep my monitor resolution at 1280 by 1024(20-inch). But with the combination of thick fonts, glossy paper, and no line spacing between paragraphs gives me eyestrain after reading a page or two. The book is best not read under strong florescent lights."
1,Absolutely terrible book,"I really disliked the organized of the book. It is written as if objects were an after thought, has very strange explanations, and poor quality, overly simple examples.The ""Common Programming Errors"", ""Good Programming Practice"" and ""Tips"" are silly, trivial and clutter what little logic the chapters have to offer. The authors teaching philosophy seems to be: Throw in every programming tip anyone ever thought of. This is just another cookie-cutter book with a new cover. At 61.00 USD, this clone is a real rip off."
1,Among the worst Java books,"I would love to see the code written by those people who think this book is ""great"". Its amazing how low some peoples standards are."
1,"Not for beginners. Pretty comprehensive, but poorly written","The authors are constantly trying to explain multiple things at once (which they do poorly), and when they have a point to make they repeat themselves 3-4 times with various types of text. In each section, they try to give general programming tips, java programming tips (redundant to the section), explain the material of the section, explain the details of a Java program and make a feeble attempt to explain the details of a new concept brought out in the Java program (which you will need to know for the next 10 programs but which wont be explained for 4 chapters). They explain these things all at the same time. The material is poorly organized (the book is organized as if they are using the same template and applying it to Java) and the explanations are weak."
2,Not worth it's price.,"This book is not for people that can program. It's very vague and doesn't cover everything.If your a beginner, I'd advise you to still look for a better book. This book is organized poorly.What this book does do, is it explains all the examples VERY well, In fact does this thoughout the whole book, and gets boring reading explainations about trivial stuff."
1,poor design,Readers that rate this book highly obviously do not understand object-oriented programming. Doesn't anyone find it ironic that a book about an object-oriented programming language repeats the same code over and over again?
2,Java Made Inaccessible,"This book has some strengths, but it takes a inordinate amount of time to find them. There is no glossary, and the student has no idea which applet or abstract windowing toolkit to import or why. I find little connection between the exercises and the text examples. What we need is a concise introduction, one that gets to the point. This is not that book."
1,5 stars ???????????,These 4 and 5 star reviews have got to be fake. No serious programmer could give the poorly written explanations and silly tips in this book even an average rating.
3,Lots of stuff covered but kinda muddled,"I thought that the text was fairly comprehensive, however, it jumbles up several concepts withing topics. For example, GUI components are introduced in the chapter covering control structures. It wasn't always clear what the main point of the chapter or section was. Having said that, the text does get you up to speed fairly quickly on a variety of topics and you'll be able to create simple applications and applets after reading the first few chapters.I also felt that it would be best to have an object-oriented and C++ background before reading this book. I felt the explanations of object-oriented topics wasn't very clear and that references were made to pointers and other features in C++ that may lead only to confusion for those that have never programmed with C++."
2,Poor Service,"The book was supposed to be shipped within 1 to 2 days, but instead was postmarked 1 week after. I ordered several books at the same time from different vendors and this book was the last to arrive over 1 week after the others. The quality of the book also was low in that the pages were bent and the cover had corners that were bent as well. I would never buy from this vendor again."
4,portable speaker system for nano,"nice lightweight portable system, simple to use, good sound, however, if you have a cover on your ipod, you might have to remove it so the dock will connect, but overall i was pretty happy with this unit"
2,Poor sound quality,"I purchased a Lansing inMotion from Sharper Image three years ago and am very happy with it. After opening this Lansing and hooking my ipod up to it, I was very disappointed with it. The sound quality was poor at high volumes. The bass sounded tinny and the voices were not clear. I contacted the seller for an exchange and heard nothing in reply."
2,bad information,I believed and expected a new product for 220 dollars .... I got a well worn box that I can't present as a gift. The site does a very poor job of informing you of your product. Will never by a gift here again. Second time I was mislead! I am done!
4,easy learner,"Had never installed flooring before and this tool made it a breeze. Did have a jamb with nails and it was when there were less than 2 inches left. Worked really well at getting flooring in tight. Make sure to order plenty of nails (figure one every 6"" on a 7"" nailing or more if using shorts) as this may hold up your project."
5,Working great for me,"I bought this nailer to install about 1700 square feet of Brazilian cherry flooring. I'm about half way through the job and the nailer has performed flawlessly. I really only had 1 misfire and thats because I let the nailer slip while hammering. The ratchet ram is a nice feature. I've used the one hit nailers before and this is much easier to work with. It usually takes 2 hits to drive the nails home, maybe 3 when you start to get tired. I've actually found that lighter hits seem to work better and you get less splitting. All in all, its a great product, made in the USA, and I would highly recommend it."
3,Rock Hudson,"If you are a Rock Hudson fan, you'll love this cute little movie. It is classic bachelor gets captured by glamour girl. Very humerous!"
4,Come September,"This is among my favorites of the 1960's romantic comedies. The generational duel between Rock Hudson and Bobby Darin as they woo Gina Lollobrigida and Sandra Dee is hilarious. Victor Slezak is a gem as the major domo who turns Rock's beautiful villa into a top hotel for 11 months of the year until Come September. When Rock shows up early, he throws everyone into a panic as the staff attempts to prevent him from discovering that his villa is the ""best hotel in town."""
1,Don't buy this book.,"I bought this book thinking there might be something resembling a definition of flirting. There was, but it was in one of the latter chapters. The whole book was nothing more than a series of rambling antidotes about people who were successful at flirting. None of these stories ever really delved into the technique behind it. It reminded me of reading Amway literature; or better yet, stereo/playground equipment assembly instructions."
4,Finley Wood Rack Brackets,"Reasonable design. Rot/Decay Resistant. Don't know how it will hold up under UV-sun exposure. Moderately pricy unless purchased in a bulk pack. Versatile for custom design assemblies. Accepts standard grade 2 x 4s. Requires fasteners through pre-drilled holes for safe, sturdy assembly. A little tricky to install continuous shelving board. If handy make the cut-outs for the vertical posts, and a few screws secured to horizontal rails. Very sturdy! Otherwise, follow mfg. instructions and cut half sheets for shelving. That leaves voids on the ends and middle, and looks cosmetically crude. But you can cut inserts and patch them in, like I did. Useful as base supports to align/square 2x4 uprights and rails for multi-shelf storage. I used 3 of them to create the base for a 84"" high x 104"" long x 16"" deep storage unit. Brackets on each end and one at the mid-span. Built the rest with only 2 x 4s and saved a ton of money, since brackets at each of 5 shelves = 15 brackets."
1,Used for a firewood stand,"I bought these instead of forking out 200.00 for a steel firewood bin. Unless you have a keen mind for 3D, it will be hard to explain my problem. I had anticipated a 12 foot firewood bin, with the support 2X4s on end so that the grain of the wood on the base would support the firewood. These aren't designed to allow for that... they are designed for the 2x4s to be flat, which will warp and break unless they are flat on the ground, which defeats the whole purpose of trying to get the wood up off of the ground. I ended up having to cut two of the brackets in half and screw them to the uprights to get them to work. They may be fine for a garage storage shelf, but there are better products out there for an outdoor firewood bin that will be subjected to the weather."
4,Easier than I expected,"A video with the words 'fat burner' in the title really should rev up your engines, so I found this one to be a bit disappointing. It's just too easy, pulling segments from her 'Low Impact' and 'Stress Reduction' videos, which are low-intensity routines. But you won't be bored--the change of style, scenery, and music makes it fun and interesting. The moves are very easy to catch on to, even in the dancy 'Lean Routine' segment. Horrifying 80's fashion and scary electric blue leotards, but your eyes will soon adjust. Overall an easy workout for advanced exercisers, probably great for beginners."
5,quality reprint of historical book.,This is an exact reprint of historical facts for each town in Cheshire County NH.
3,good for everyday,"Not your top of the line, but still decent. hydrates well, but is a bit runny.Good for Beginners 30 and up!"
4,Well worth it!,"The Images of America series is an incredible assemblage of photographically driven history books about Cities and Towns from the very large to the very small. They're written with the cooperation of local historical societies and have a depth of material I've never seen in other books. If you've got any interest in seeing the early days and evolution of your area or an area you grew up in, I highly recommend these books. They're great for gifts!!"
5,Cute book that everyone will want to get their paws on!,"I bought this book for my wife, who loves dogs and artistic photographs. It's got lots of pictures of puppies (and adult dogs too) and great little poems/writings next to each photo.Guaranteed to make you smile! Order this fine coffeee table book today!"
3,cover was a bit more damaged than expected,I received this book on time. The cover was a bit more damaged than expected. Overall condition of the book was fine.
5,Good history of JG,"I have just done a Grateful Dead ""unit"" (read 6 books, listened to all my old tapes and albums, etc) and I found this book be the most balanced; neither semi-sanitized like McNally or possibly exagerated like Scully. No one book will give you the best view, but I thought this the best single book overall, told in the voices, and with the imperfections, of the GD ""family""."
4,Fascinating portrait of Jerry--a must-read for Dead/Jerry Fans,"This is the first book I've ever read that was constructed almost entirely from interviews. I was surprised by how successful the author was in creating a cohesive narrative of Jerry's life using this tool alone. Starting with Jerry's childhood years and leading up until the time of his death, the patchwork of quotations and interview segments is masterfully woven into a quite satisfying take on Jerry's life. I write ""take on"" his life because no biography is definitive or without bias, and using interview segments is naturally going to produce an even larger measure of subjectivity than an ordinary biography.I am really thankful to have had a chance to read this book (on my new Kindle HD, no less) :). I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes to gain more knowledge of and insights about Jerry's life."
5,Works great,"These days it seems like all electronics are crap, not the IR-250. This product does exactly what it's supposed to do and seems very well built. I hooked it up with some really bad cable and it still works like a champ. Hookup was easy, signal repeat is lighting fast, works from any angle and it looks great. I liked that all I had to do was run 3 wires to this receiver. I love it and would recommend it to anyone/everyone."
3,Good and dirty music from a 1960's rock band,"A warning sticker about the lyrics should be included on the packaging of this C.D. The Raiders do use the ""F"" word in ""Louie, Louie."" ""Crisco Party"" depicts an orgy. ""Over You"" is about murdering a woman who rejects a man. And the classic ""Hungry"" has previously censored lyrics, about getting stoned, restored. Yet, The Raiders also sang ""Kicks won't bring you peace of mind."" It's hard to figure!. These guys make The Rolling Stones sound like choir boys.Musically, The Raiders play as well, if not better, than any other 1960's rock band (Except on Stepping Stone - It's not quite as powerfull as The Monkees in concert version from 1967). The disc features good sound and linear notes. Also, (almost forgot) - their great mid-sixties hits are also on this collection."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,"if i would have spent more money on it, it would be worth the effort to return the broken one. i didn't realize from the product review it was not completely submergable, i was really careful not to get it wet and on the first day it blew on me. don't waist your time. you have much better options."
1,waste of money,"I got this 25w heater for my sons 5g betta tank, it's worked ok for the past couple days although you have to keep messing with the setting, it doesn't want to hold a consistent temp. Finally thought i had it good, by last night it was holding steady at about 80-82 degrees, then this morning it's at 74 and even though I've cranked it back up the light just keeps going on and off sporadically and the temperature is not changing. Not too mention the pain in the butt mounting on it, even with my 5g rectangular aquarium I have to keep the water filled to the brim to meet the water line on the heater. Should've spent a few extra dollars on a better quality product."
3,CAUTION: language,"It's a funny enough book, and it has some great scenes. It's easy to read and very fast. Kids under a second grade reading level can easily manage the vocabulary and length.And there's the problem. Leif Eriksson's skald (like a minstrel) has the name Bullshik, which is funny in that all his rhymes sort of stretch the truth, but sounds like an absolutely forbidden word. (You show me a second grader who is going to resist saying that one out loud. I'll show you the other twenty-five second graders in the classroom who all got notes sent home for *not* resisting.)At the end of the book, you get the Viking alphabet (excellent)."
3,Easy to assemble -- but you provide your own wood!,"The package was shipped timely, but I had mistakenly thought that it would include the wood needed for the shelves and 2 x 4 lumber. Still, no problem -- bought the wood separately at Home Depot, and assembled the workbench, with 2 helpers, in about 2 hours. The workbench legs are plastic, not metal, but they are strong and light and were easy to work with during the assembly. You can select the dimensions of the shelves and the 2 x 4 stringers to customize the size and shape of the workbench. Also, the brackets for the supplemental shelving allow you to custom-design that part of the unit as well.Assembly directions come in the form of pictures on a fold-out sheet of paper -- requiring some study before starting -- but very logical.I now have a very sturdy workbench in my workshop and am enjoying it."
4,Workbench Review,"Good Product. Advertisement though doesn't really state what you will receive, not real clear on the advertisement. You will just get the table legs and supports. No wood involved, So dont let the full workbench Pic fool you.Otherwise, once you obtain the wood, Workbench works great and is very sturdy and level.Highly Recommend."
5,"Just as described, works great!","These legs attach to the 2x4's that you supply easily to create a benchtop with two shelves. Top shelf is on the narrow side, but that is a very minor negative. If you cut your 2x4's accurately you'll wind up with a very solid benchtop. Hope this was helpful."
5,Very Pleased,"This is a wonderful kit to build your dream work bench. I bought it on Amazon for about 60 bucks added in another 130 for (10) 2x4s (1)4x8' pegboard sheet, and (3) 3/4""x4'x8' plywood sheets and I came out with an excelent 4'x5' work bench with shelves. And the best part about this kit is you can make it the perfect size to fit your needs. Well the table height is about the only dimention you cannot change. I am extremely pleased with this product and would recomend it to anyone."
2,"I LOVE SpongeBob, however...","What's with the repeats?! 2 of the episodes on this disc have already been released on previous mini sets!And where in Davy Jones' locker is ""Help Wanted"" already?Barnacles!"
1,Nick doesn't do it again,"I absoulutely must agree with the other writers. I love most of these episodes, but thousands of people are buying episodes which they might already own. Please, Nick, we are waiting for new episode on the market. Don't let us down."
4,Inclues 5 episodes,"Includes 5 Episodes From Spongebob SquarepantsHome Sweet Pineapple (From Season 1)Band Geeks (From Season 2)Sandy, Spongebob and the Worm (From Season 2)Ripped Pants (From Season 1)Sandy's Rocket (From Season 1)"
3,Good...if You're Expecting Twins.,"This is yet another adorable book featuring Little Cub and her parents. In this installment, Little Cub's mother is expecting a sibling and so it talks about how first God gave them Little Cub and now God has given them another cub (so they will have two!) It's a cute introduction to being a big sibling (even though Little Cub is a girl, boys won't have a hard time identifying with her, frankly I'm always a little taken aback when they use a female pronoun for her because otherwise she's really fairly genderless). At the end of the book, Little Cub becomes a big sister to not just one new cub, but twins. This actually caused my son to ask if you always get twins as the second child, so that's something to consider if you know you're only expecting a singleton.Otherwise, it's a great little book"
2,Very Pretty but not described correctly!!!,I loved the pattern in this set and the description said for a kids twin bed. When I took it out of the package it was long enough but only wide enough for half the bed.
4,Great hoodie,"This sweatshirt's served me well over the years. It's really warm while not being too thick. It's soft and quite comfy. Best of all, it's got the Patriots' logo right where everyone can see it. My only complaint (and the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars) is that one of the metal loops (for the hood string) fell of quite early on. I think it might have just been bad luck, as the other loop has stayed in place for years. If you're a big Pats fan, you'll love this sweatshirt."
2,Way too basic,"I didn't feel this cd went into enough detail about anything and the detail it did was extremely basic. For example:""How would you ask someone about their goals"" Answer: ask them ""Have you thought about your goals?"" really? If you can't figure out questions like that on your own, I am thinking coaching is not for you! There were many other basic questions like this. I just wasn't impressed at all."
1,The Runaround!!!!!!,"I have tried to do the right thing and give Best Price Mirror the chance to make things right, but after repeated failed attempts at contacting ""Peter"" at the number he provided as well as numerous unanswered emails and phone calls to their site, I have decided to once again enter a negative review, which I reluctantly removed after an earlier promise by ""Peter"" to make things right. It has now been over 3 months since my initial order was placed, and I still do not have the correct item. All I can say to anyyone placing an order with BPM is ""BUYER BEWARE!"
4,Great for soups and/or gravy,"Since I am originally from Europe, I thought I couldn't live without KNORR Bouillon, but over the years I found out that I am reacting poorly to that product's MSG. I tried every other bouillon cube and/or soup and gravy base available, but was never happy with the results. Finally, I found ""Better Than Bouillon"" @ amazon.com and that product, together with another ""cubed"" bouillon, also on amazon.com, I was able to make my soups and gravies (or should I say ""sauces"") which everybody always liked about my cooking. You cannot go wrong with this product!"
5,somebody PLEASE make this into a movie,"this is one of the best books i have read this year! the characters are beautifully drawn, the dialogue spot on and the plot is fast paced. don't start this at night, or you'll be rubbing your eyes in the morning and complaining about your lost sleep. the thing about improbable is the unique way the author uses quantam physics. a good companion to this book is extraordinary knowing by dr.elizabeth mayer----not a novel, but a fact based discussion of non-local awareness.."
1,the most unlikable heroine i've ever read,loved _The Last Viking_ and thought i'd try another of hers. i only made it 100pages in and couldn't take the petty self serving crass cheating loudmouth anymore. Ms. Hill- strong women don't have to be such jerks!
5,A Beautiful Book,This is a fantastic book but I don't think most people would want to spend nearly $500 for a copy. I was able to find a copy on AbeBooks (in Germany) and had it shipped to the U.S. for less than $50 total. If interested try AbeBooks or Alibris. I hope all lovers of Tanguy's work can get a copy. Even if you can only get a German language text version the color plates and reproductions are worth the purchase!
5,Very Good Description of ActiveX and OLE (including COM),"I read this book and found it very well written and clear. It is one of the better books I have read about ActiveX and OLE.David is knowledgable and walks you through all the concepts regarding this important technology.Whether you are a manager of information technology, senior technical architect, or programmer you should get this book."
3,My 1 yr old kinda likes it,Bought this as one of my sons first birthday gifts. He doesn't seem to like or dislike it. He does enjoy dropping the frog in the chute but that's about all.He has had this toy almost a month now. He has been able to rip the top part off..ie the top portion of the spiral...but then again he has also been able to take the covers off the outlet child proof caps and we have already purchased 2 different types of outlet safety caps.
3,Didn't Occupy Interest Long,Had this toy out at playgroup and none of the kids played with it for very long. I liked it more than they did.
3,Fun for a bit,"I have a 17 month old and a 3 year old (just turned 3) and this was given to my younger son. However, they will both play with it together (I think my older son plays with it only to play with his brother). They enjoy figuring out while hole the items will end up in, however, I can't say that it keeps their attention for a long time. It is cute and keeps them busy for a little while. It would be nice if more then just the frog went down the tube though. I am not sure why other people had problems with the construction or the button that pops the frog out. Our tower stays together just fine and the button to pop the frog out is very easy. My 17 month old has no problems at all."
2,Ball tower toy,"I read great reviews of this toy, but was disappointed with it. The balls and penguin do not fit into the top of the tower (ONLY the frog). Ball popper by hasbro. THe penguin does not make it down the spiral without assistance. My children kept trying to put balls into the tower and they did not fit.We returned it and got the Ball Popper by Hasbro. (though I'm not a huge fan of toys that make noise and music the music is continuos and all my children (ages 1, 3, 5) spend HOURS with this one."
3,Toy,"I bought this for my two-year-old grandson, but his four-year-old and six-year-old siblings were also enthralled with it."
3,Mechanism that releases frog broke,"We loved this toy for the first month or so. The mechanism that releases the frog ended up braking later on, and it is now constantly getting stuck. Otherwise, we've had a lot of fun with this toy...just disappointed that element didn't last longer."
2,Less than expected,"The concept of this toy is great, however the parts don't work too well. The frog, which is the only item that fits down the tube, often gets stuck in the tube. You need to put it in at a precise angle and push to make sure it doesn't get stuck. The balls and the penguin are fun to watch roll down the spiral, but they don't always make it down to their ""spot"". They sometimes get stuck after they exit the spiral.These problems don't seem to bother by 1 year-old, but they bother me.One good feature is the release button for the tube, it's great for learning cause and effect, because you have to push it to get the frog out."
5,KAPOW,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT VERY FAST DELIVERY THE SIZE IS GOOD IF YOU CANT TRY ONE ON FIRST GO WITH AT LEAST A SIZE SMALLER THAN NORMAL.IM A 44INCH CHEST 5'10 ""HEIGHT AND I BOUGHT A SIZE M ITS SLIGHTLY LOOSE WITHOUT THE LINER BUT GOOD FIT WITH IT ATTACHED"
4,Sizes are deceiving,"The quality of this jacket is actually quite high considering the price. However the sizes run WAY too large and I strongly recommend you purchase TWO full sizes below what is listed. For instance I am usually a Medium and I purchased a Xsmall and it is still a large fit.For those of you attempting a urban military or milspec./hipster look this is a very clean cut and ""fresh"" jacket. It is not distressed in anyway shape or form. This is a positive in my book so as each individual can utilize the jacket as a personal canvas.Over all this jacket is great except for the horrible sizing issue. If not for the sizing problems I would rate this item 5 stars."
1,Not what it used to be,"When I saw this at amazon I was thrilled.My last BucketBoss extreme Gear 06053 Hopalong Gatemouth tool bag held up extremely well fter 5 years of daily use in the telecom field. It started to wear,so I would buy a new one and everything would be good. Didn't turn out that way. Bucketboss went from a tough rubber bottom to a stitched material with a piece of plastic sewed between the layers for support. Well, after exactly 2 days of normal use the front of the bag collapsed from the weight of my tools which my last tool bag carried and continues to carry no problem for 5 + years.If you lay it on a flat surface it just falls over. Something is definitely wrong with quality control to let this glorified hand bag be called a tool bag . My last one was a 5 star this one is an embarrassment and going back."
3,Long May He Run,"People either like Neil or hate him. With that having been said, if you like Neil, buy this video..You will not be disappointed."
5,Great DVD !!!,It was so nice to discover this DVD featuring Neal Young and the wonderful Nils Lofgren. What a treat to see both of them in action
5,Like the case almost as much as I like the scent,"the 3.4 OZ seems to be the genuine article, wonderful scent (at least I think so) the small booklet came inside the box as well which leads me to conclude this is the real deal, had issues with a different seller on a different size, BTW serial number was NOT ground off, when I am ready and if I can get a 3.4 OZ REFILL from AMAZON i will"
1,VERY OLD,For a quality fragrance this must be very old the only thing I get out of it is TAR that is is so to all a warning that you might get an aweful smelling fragrance if you get an old one but it is luck of the draw.
2,sure wish they had a one size fits all,"lenses are big and arms are not long enough; So, glasses fit very tight around the ears. sure wish they had one size fits all. those wrap around the ear arms are the worst"
3,"Tonka front loading garbage truck, like the real thing.","I chose the rating because the truck is well built, but the bucket wouldn't stay on the lift. My grandson, however, was thrilled with it. After opening this present, he wasn't interested in any of the other presents."
1,"breaks easily, horrible customer service","Besides breaking easily, the screws have an odd shaped head that prevents you from putting it back together easily and they're customer service is horrible. Tonka has sold their name to a chinese company and when you call for help with the screws they'll refer you to that company even though it is their name on the truck. And the Chinese company will never answer your email, of course."
2,Motor breaks easily,"My son loves trucks and was thrilled to received this one. Unfortunately the motorized can lift on the side was broken within 2 minutes and that was with an adult showing him how to use it, he hadn't touched it yet. He's only just turning 2 so he doesn't realize there's anything wrong, he's still happy, but don't get it for an older kid."
5,Bringing Back Old Memories,"I was in Junior High when Buddy Clark was at the height of his fame. Most of the other girls were crazy about Sinatra, but I loved Buddy Clark. He had such a beautiful voice, he could put over a song like nobody else, except maybe Bing Crosby back in his early days. Buddy Clark would sing with Doris Day, Dinah Shore and make them sound even better than they were alone. It was just terrible when he died in that plane crash in 1949, by then I was in High School, and I was just devastated. It was years before I could listen to another male singer, but Tony Bennett came along, and I felt that he was as close as anyone could get to singing as well as Buddy Clark sang, and some songs he sang reminded me of the way Buddy sang, like Because of You. I've been buying Buddy's records lately, and enjoying him all over again in my retirement years! RCinNYC"
3,Not bad for a collector of hit songs..!,"I collect billboard hits. This album has 12 of 16 songs thatwere actually hits.....truly remarkable average. I have noway of knowing whether they were the orginal songs though, butI'm willing to take a chance..... Most hit albums are not hitsat all, which if you collect, you soon find out. At least thesong titles match up!!"
4,Durable and educational,"This book is super durable. It says on the back cover to not allow your children to chew on the foam pieces. I try my best to stop my son but always catch him in the midst of chewing!! The book and the pieces in the book have held up incredibly well to my son (14 months) attempting to rip, smash, throw, and chew it. Besides a few bite marks there is no damage. Also, I find the book to be very descriptive and educational. The textures that the truck pieces are inlaid are interesting and diverse. These soft shape books are exactly what I was looking for for my son. The only thing I don't like about them is that the pieces are super easy to pull out of their spots on the page. Alot of the time they just fall out of their spots. That is my only complaint."
3,"works well, but we'll see how long it lasts","I've only used this on two bottles. It sure makes the opening easier, but.....it doesn't look very well made, so I don't know how many bottles I can expect it to open......After about 6 uses, the plastic stand broke, so now it sits crooked on the counter. I've probably opened 40 bottles by now and it still opens them beautifully!"
2,breaks too easily,"When it worked, this was a great product. Corks pulled out really easily. Unfortunately this opener did not last long. We probably open a max of 8 - 10 bottles of wine per year. It only lasted a year. Not convinced it's worth the price to open that few bottles."
5,Effortless wine bottle opener,"I used one of these at a friend's house, and was amazed at the simplicity of use. At this price, it was worth it, even considering some of the questionable long term reliability concerns from previous reviewers. My use is moderate, maybe 2 bottles per week, and I'm following the lubrication recommendations of one reviewer.My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to make a modification to the stand to include some kind of snap-in device to hold that spare corkscrew underneath."
4,Looks pretty good,"It works good, it's easy to open bottles with it. The only Con is that it is much bigger than expected.I recommend it."
1,Broke after 2 months,I bought this in Aug. and it came apart in 2 months. We had a Connoisseur fromPrice Club many years ago and that lasted for years.This does not even compare to that one. I gave it onestar only because I had to. It is not worth buying it.
1,Terrible. 2nd one in less than two months. Both broke.,"I really liked this wine opener, until it stopped pulling corks. Which was about 10 days in to the first one I ordered. I managed to return it and get a replacement w/o charge via Amazon's return policy. The second one lasted a little longer, in fact, just outside of the Amazon 30-day return period. I had hoped to return it too, but times up. This is a very nice looking and nice feeling opener. But, both just stopped pulling corks when still virtually new. They would screw in, but not pull the cork out of the bottle.Extremely disappointed. I have a Rabbit opener for about 3 years and it still works. I liked the MIU as it has a longer lever arm and needs less effort to screw in and pull the cork, while it still works, that is.Advice: Don't buy it. If you do, keep the boxes and return it quickly when it stops working."
1,Breaks too easily,"This would be a decent product if it didn't break after so little use. I'll bet I didn't even open 20 bottles of wine before it broke. The company, MIU FRANCE, doesn't even respond to emails. It can't be returned to Amazon since I bought it awhile ago, although I never used it much until recently.Very disappointing."
4,"Works, so far","I bought this as a inexpensive replacement for a worn-out screwpull. The first one worked OK until it literally started to fall apart - first a plastic stopper, followed by a shaft, etc. Amazon was first class at replacing the unit, shipping me a new one as a replacement and taking the old one back. The second one has been working without any problems to date. Thus, I imagine that the first one was simply an outlier.What was disappointing about this unit is the foil cutter, which doesn't work nearly as well as that of the Screwpull (MIU elected to save some money by not using sharpend wheels like the screwpull foil cutter does)."
1,Gift gone bad!,I gave this wine opener as a gift because I have a similar opener. After my gift was used a few times it broke. I traded my used but working opener for the broken one in order to redeem my gift gone bad. I tried using the MIU and it is (politely) junk. Don't buy this and in particular don't give it as a gift.
1,Worthless Piece of JUNK,I bought this to replace a well used Professional Corkscrew sold by Cosco. It looked identical so I bvought it. BAD Move. It opened three bottles and broke. Wow what a deal! The cost to open the bottle cost more than the bottle. Please do not waste your money on this one!
5,Rhiannon,"Boulet was a very gifted artist, whose work is extremely inspiring on a deeply spiritual level. These cards portray her art splendidly, along with wonderful descriptions of the goddesses on the reverse side. The Goddess Knowledge Cards can be used as a divination tool, for daily inspiration and guidance, or simply for the enjoyment of Art. Boulet included many of the lesser-known goddesses in this deck, such as Rhiannon (my personal favorite, as this is also my granddaughter's name). The cards are beautifully printed on heavy, high-gloss cardstock. The artwork is undeniably remarkable. They cards will be appreciated by many."
3,Just Pretty,These cards are very pretty. I didn't feel any connection with them. I found them hard to use. Definitely not for beginners. If you want pretty cards to look at or to use as conversation pieces they would be fine.
3,Beautiful pictures!,"It is lovely designed and printed book, I can tell it right away for I use to work in a print house myslef. Their graphic designer is great! As for contents - well, it basically teaches you how to gather ideas and make your own cool sketch book or scrapbook for those project ideas. NOT what I was looking for. Lots of inspirational works shown, not in a way of tutorials though. Beautiful photographs, nice coffee table book, not actual reference book."
2,To little how in the text,"The author actually has some ideas about software project management. His ideas seem feasible and applicable for practice. But it's difficult for us to understand as how to solve the problems other than only to know the concepts. Even though the author had some discussions, it's not enough for understanding. He show us the structures of the artifacts with too little explaination. It may be better if the author can provide some case studies."
5,The Ultimate Journey Compilation,"This set contains what Journey was in the early days as well as what influenced each member of the group and then what many of us remember Journey as. From the early fusion days to the live versions of ""Girl Can't Help It"" and ""I'll Be Alright Without You"" It is the ultimate Journey collection for anyone who is a fan or for anyone who isn't but just likes the music. This is a must and of all the boxsets I have, this is the one that gets played the most. For the Steve Perry fans, you can see how when Steve came into the group, the influence he has on the direction of the band at that time. You can't even get tired of hearing the songs and Neal Schon's guitar playing. This is a must have for any music fan!!!"
1,Unsure yet,"Of the 2 dogs that have tried this, none of them seem very interested in chewing on it. Tried soaking in beef broth and they at least licked it for a while. Originally thought it folded up to be able to hide something inside a dog would want to look for. The links just move side to side."
5,Fantastic Toy!!!,My Bulldog is on his 4th Puzzle Bone. He can spend hours chewing on it. Recommended for power chewers.
1,Brad Nails,"I'm sure the brads would work great, but the packing left a like to be desired. They arrived completly broken into small pieces. Totally unusable."
5,How it's done,"I just finished spending two weeks building a guitar with William Cumpiano in his shop and I have to say it was a great experience and produced a great guitar, which I believe you can do directly from this book in a similiar way. I love the depth of information here and the care with which it's presented, a direct reflection of the authors' personalities. When working with just the book you need to go slow, be sure you understand exactly what you are doing before you do it, and stay alert to what is going on with your guitar as it evolves. A wonderful book that distills a lifetime of experience and I can say for a fact that the methods described work perfectly."
5,"""Hows"" and ""whys"" of guitarmaking","This book was very worth the money. The book walks you through building both classical and steel string guitars. The text is rich with lots of details about variations in the building process and when they make sense. The instructions are concise, with helpful illustrations. Each section includes a list of tools and parts needed to complete that step. The only downside I have been able to identify is that the book is fairly thick and won't stay open well on my work area due to its typical paperback binder. Shucks."
5,Long overdue critical look at what is wrong with Apple.,"This book reviews the cult like following of Apple Computer's Fans, known as the MacJihad to some, that buy Apple products no matter what. It reviews the blunders made by Apple in the past, and the things they did wrong with their OS. Some material is dated and no longer valid, but it shows the history that Apple had in developing bug filled products and having projects fail to make money or get accepted as ""standards"". It boggles the mind how a company like that can make big blunders and still stay in business. ""Think Different"" indeed! Think Again! Thank you for the history lesson, Jim Carlton."
3,"The reason why we ""love the computer, hate the company.""","If you've been using Macs (and in my case, Lisas and Apple ][s) for a long enough time, you probably think you know all the imporant names and projects that have made Apple Computer great. Now learn about the failures, the project that were dropped too soon, or too late; the people you thought you knew, and how their egos and competitiveness ruined them. Learn about ""Star Trek,"" the joint Apple, Intel project to run the Mac OS on Intel platforms -- before Windows 3. It ran. A group of twenty Apple programmers had arudimentary Finder running and ready to demonstate. Until Apple's fear of pissing-off Motorolla killed the deal. You may know that ""Code Warrior"" is the de-facto standard for application compilers for the Mac. How they got there, their brilliant demonstration of their superior product, and how it saved Apple's ass in 1994 is a masterpeice."
5,Best High Tech Business Book,"Don't listen to those Apple weenies who can't stand to hear a negative word about their favorite cult. This is an exceptionally insightful book for anyone who wonders what really happens in the corridors of high-tech. It does not ""dis"" the technology; it tells the tale of corporate manuevering in excruciatingly plausible detail. Executives of all stripes, from any industry, will benefit from this cautionary tale."
3,A Day Late and a Dollar Short,"Kirkus got it half right, Apple's one and only mistake was not licensing the Mac, but it was Jobs' mistake back in 1984 not Sculley's. I love my Macs, but they were stupid high expensive back in the late eighties and now Apple is paying the price. People wanted a cheap box that is ""good enough"". Will Apple over price Rhapsody too? Probably and it's a damn shame."
2,Perhaps a should-read but is this a must-read? I doubt.,"If someone wants to read about Apple, whether from an end-user's perspective or an industry insider's perspective, to search for what this company ought to do it right in a near future, this book should in the list of important readings.My warning to such readers is that it would take a lot of will-power or strong interests to keep wading through the stories presented in this book, i.e. blunders after blunders by Apple, and an endless list of ""what if they did that, or did not do that at the time"".Overall, I have become pretty much exhausted after finishing reading this book. A major part of that comes from Apple's past actions and/or non-actions as recorded in this book. At the same time, I have to admit that the rest my exhaustion certainly did come from the repetitive writing style of this book, as already pointed out by many other reviewers here."
2,"Compelling subject, poor presentation","I didn't need to read Mr. Carlton's bio to know he's a news journalist. The book reads like a 350 page news article. Tragic story, though, and worth sticking with for anyone who ever cared about Apple."
5,Follow the Yellow Brick Road,"If your looking to find your way to the Emerald City and to gain great wealth in real estate -- Robert Shemin's 40 Day Plan will net you results. There's no place like home.... especially ones that yeild great profits. This book is a ""Great Guide"" that gets results fast."
1,Way over priced.,Get it at Drugstore.com for $7.00 The product is very good though. Tasty and keeps you gluten free. I would look around for better prices. Our local Sprouts carries it s well.
5,Top class,"Bob Wills was at his best when Tommy Duncan was the singer. This CD contains the best material from the early period of Wills' career. Along with Moon Mullican and Cliff Bruner, Wills' early band was one of the greatest and bluesiest western swing groups in existence. Wills put western swing on the map and the impact of that great genre is felt in honky tonk, bluegrass and rockabilly ever since."
1,Not Efective!!!,"I spend hours trying to clean my lenses, no luck.Used the brush and then the carbon mat, just to realize that i have to brush again, and again, and again.Useless !!!!"
5,Great Product,"This is a great product.I don't have to tell you how to use it because other reviewers have done that.Let me say that you simply do not have to touch your lens to get it clean. the less you touch your lens, the less opportunity you have of scratching it.There are other versions of this same thing out there in other catalogs. However, this is the product I suggest. The brush is fuller and seems to do a better job of brushing off debris.I carry this with me everywhere. And it is small enough and light enough that you will hardly even notice it's there. But once you have one and use it, you will notice if it's not there.Well worth the money.Enjoy."
4,LensPen works great,"LensPen works great for what its worth. It cleans the camera lens well. One star less for the quality of brush, as its strings could be breaking or damaged easily."
5,Lens cleaner,"Really nice, compact way to clean your camera lenses & filters. Easy to carry, & much easier to use than paper cleaners."
4,It gets the job done,I have found that the best results in lens cleaning come when I start out the old fashoned way by cleaning with lens cleaning fluid and a lens cleaning cloth and then use the pen to clean up any remaining lens fluid residue (streaks or shiny spots). It is also very handy for cleaning that space where the glass meets the metal on the front of the lens.
4,Helpful product.,This is a useful gadget for helping to keep my camera clean as promoted. I am not entirely sure it will be well used but I photograph in usually a clean environment.
5,Fits Right Into My Camera Bag,This lens pen is perfect. I bought it as a nice portable lens cleaner for my DSLR lenses. This item works perfectly. Very nice and small fits right into DSLR camera bag or a shirt pocket.
2,Not much of a system.,"I was excited to discover such a compact cleaning system, but upon use was very disappointed. The brush end works fine, but the cleaning head only smears any smudges you have on your lens. It says to give the cap on the cleaning end a twist to recharge it, but I do not see that this accomplishes anything. Unfortunately I am left with a marginally useful (brush end) piece of plastic. Don't buy it!"
1,LOUSY PRODUCT,"This stick was good on two lenses: it cleaned them really good. After that, it was good for nothing else but making lenses even dirtier. I would not recomend it at all. To me it was a waste of money."
1,"Below expectation, quite a disappointment","I've had a lenspen bought from overseas which cleans lens really well. I had been recommending lenspen to my fellow friends as a needed accessory for photographers. Unfortunately I lost it and thus bought a new one from Amazon to replace it. Even though it's the exact brand and have the exact look, it's a huge diappointment compared to the first one I had. After using it for some time, the ""hair"" part of the lenspen start dropping on the lens while I was cleaning it. The other flat side of the tip leaves blackish residue on the lens as well. Instead of cleaning the lens, it's dirtying the lens.A major disappointment."
2,Simply impractical,"I bought this as a little add on so I could get free amazon shipping. I wish I had chosen the typical lens wipes or spray instead. This product sticks out as a simple, original, and effective cleaner but it hardly lives up to expectations. I use it on my glasses and iphone primarily. It's easy to hold and the brush is good at getting off random bits of particles that may have flown your way, but when you get down to it, the actual cleaner barely works. It explains to clean it circles - all this does is leave circular smudges on whatever surface was used. For the price of this product I would get something much more dependable and worthy. Maybe next time i'll save some money and just use some gosh darn sudsy water. I do not recommend this product."
1,osley,"This item is a fake! When I received the package, it was a knockoff from Hong Kong! I opened it to make sure though, and when I tried to clean my lens with the felt, it smeared black stuff all over the front element! I thought I had ruined it, but thankfully, I could clean the black smudges off. It was perhaps one of the worst products you could use on your lens. DO NOT BUY IT!"
4,Good for quick cleaning...,"While I would always recommend a microfiber/lint free lens cleaning cloth as the first choice for cleaning lenses, the LensPEN is an excellent alternative.The soft cleaning pad is pre-coated with a ""dry carbon compound"" that removes dust from the lens surface. The other end of the then pen houses a soft, retractable brush that removes accumulated dust and dirt.Great for quick clean-ups when you don't want to break out the wipes.This would be a 5 star product if it included a cover for the brush end; although it's retractable, it can still be exposed to ambient dust and grit when retracted, and a cover could mitigate this."
1,Not the Real Deal!,"Not only does the shipped product not look like the picture, it doesn't work as well as an actual lenspen. It leaves black smudges on the paper I repeatedly tested it on so there's no way this thing is going to touch any of my lenses."
1,Defective as noted in earlier comments (tip falls off and has black smudges),"As I first tried to use the ""pen"" side to clean, I noticed that the felt was not attached to the pen itself. I thought about glueing it back on and using it but noticed that the black tip was creating very dirty black smudges which would obviously cause more trouble for whatever you try to clean.Would NOT receommend this product to anyone. The manufacturer or seller appears to have terrible quality control to let something like this out to the market."
4,works good and convenient,I had never seen one of these before but after trying it I like it. Easy to carry around and cleans the lens of dirt and prints.
5,Serves its purpose,Cleans the lens and the screen just fine. Its compact and fits just about anywhere with ease. Great product to have.
5,A Spectacular book by noted JFK assass. expert Walt Brown,"NOTE: WALT BROWN HAS MANY COPIES OF THIS BOOK LEFT AND HE WILL PERSONALLY SELL THIS VERY EXCELLENT BOOK TO YOU AT A REASONABLE PRICE. I think he sold me one for $10 plus shipping. THIS IS A FABULOUS BOOK.[Robert Morrow - I have 300+ books relating to the 1963 Coup d'Etat. You can google my essay ""LBJ-CIA Assassination of JFK]This book is a MUST BUY. Walt Brown meticulously deconstructs the Warren Commission, which really should have been called the ""Allen Dulles"" Commission because that is who was really running this farce.The Warren Report, based on a hastily prepared whitewash by J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, was a document designed to cover up a coup d'etat and posthumously and conveniently blame it all on a dead man: Lee Harvey Oswald.Walt Brown documents many examples of the W.C. trying to make a square peg fit into a circle."
3,Disagree with previous reviewer,"Have not read book. So my rating is neutral at 3 stars. The reason I write this comment because my disagreement with previous reviewer.As a proffesional at medical examiner office, I handle a lot of bodies of victims from organized crime (drug traffic). The killings are often executional style with a shot at back of head while victims knelt down with hands holding up. These drug gangs are multiethinic. Organized criminal gangs compete each other for territorial control. Executional killing are often done in drug house. Each execution often claims mutliple victims. These multiple victims are mutliethinic soldiers from competing gang."
3,where's the politics?,"Readers might be mistaken from thinking this book is about politics. It is, but not quite so much as the introduction and title would suggest. Rather, it is about religiousity in peasant movements. Ileto studies colonial movements and how they gained legitimacy from religious symbols. There are some interesting parts to the book, but it also feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. Some of the religious comparisons feel forced (such as the ""Christ-like"" leader who encourages rebels to use firearms and who flees from Spanish troops). Recommended only for scholars of colonial Philippines."
5,Simply the best kind...,These two books were phenomenal. I loved it from the first and it ends beautifully. I hope to see more of this specific creation... I hope...
5,nail set tool,"before buying this nail set i read the previous feedback,and i read alot of mixed opinions of this simple product. i have found it has worked as described, setting ""T"" cleat flooring nails. highly recommended."
1,Not worth the price and doesn't even come close to getting the job done!,"I purchased this tool because I install a lot of flooring. I switched to a stapler instead of a cleat and was looking for something to drive misfires in. Well I can positively state that this is NOT that tool. As previously stated the ""tip"" is rounded just like a flat headed screwdriver and so is the staple. So imagine trying to hit a tiny rounded object with another tiny rounded object that you need to hold precisely in place while hitting it with great force. Oops. Not the best design. Look at the end of a quality nail punch and you will see that it is concave (dished in). I would return this if I could. I recommend just using a regular nail punch and bending the staple down into the tongue instead of trying to drive the staple the rest of the way in on a misfire."
5,must have tool for installing hardwood floors,"Like the header says this is a must have tool if you install or plan on installing T&G hardwood flooring. there are times when the flooring ""cleat"" just does not set all the way, and it will need a little persuasion. This is just the tool to do it. I know some people who use a regular screwdriver for this task, but that is dangerous as most screwdrivers are made of hardned steel and are likly to chip and possibly cause injury to yourself, or someone else."
1,not working,I got the lights for a christmas present and as we hooked them up they did not work. I don't want to go to the hassel of checking wich light is out. It is certainly a pain
3,The lights are fine but...,"When t you try to plug them into each other to connect the strings, the second string does not work!"
4,Great variety,"Let me begin by stating that I just love doo wop music.But there are three things I would like to recommend about this compilation.First, the variety of tone. A good many peppy songs and a good many melancholy songs and everything between.Second, the clean quality of the remasters. Each track sounds crisply copied from 45's with no blips or skips or anything.And third, the last, the quality of the songs. These are well-crafted singles not some rag-tag assemblies of popular elements.Try it out!"
2,Elbert's disappointing arrival...,I clicked on and ordered the hard cover edition. What i received was a cardboard/paper version of the book. Throughly disappointed with this product.
2,cheap,This cable is cheap and crappy. I bought it for the low price and now I wish I'd spent more. The metal on the center post of the male end broke off the first time I used it the tolerance on the female makes a loose connection to the existing cable and required tape to ensure that the two ends stay together.You get what you pay for and this purchase was a mistake.
5,I still sing these songs - 20 years later,"Great family music - instead of watching a DVD in the car, pop this in the DVD player and sing with your kids..... What a great way to pass the time while driving. The songs become addictive after several listening sessions. Got it for my granddaughter - second generation of Tom Chapin lovers!"
2,SELDOM I LISTEN TO-,"TOM'S VOICE SOUNDS LIKE HE COULD DO BETTER AT ADULT MUSIC.WHEN HE SINGS CHILDREN'S MUSIC, HE SOUNDS SO OUT OF PLACE.THE LYRICS ARE WAY TO PRE-SCHOOLISH FOR ME IN MY OPINION.IN FACT I COULD HAVE FUN WITH THIS CD BY BACKINGTHE CAR OUT OVER IT!!USE THE CD AS A FRISBEE, OR USE IT AS A SHOTPUT!!!TOM JUST DOES NOT CUT THE MUSTARD FOR ME!!!!"
1,XML Complete is terribly incomplete.,XML Complete combines the worst of 2 worlds: it describes XML in terms of Microsoft tools and none of the samples work because they use an outdated version of these tools. Wait for another book.
1,"I renamed this book ""XML Complete CRAP""","After reading through this book, I was so thoroughly disgusted that I took the time to print out a new title, ""XML Complete CRAP"", and tape it to the spine of this book. I even matched the color and the font exactly! Why did I spend an hour of my time doing this? Because I wanted to save my co-workers the effort of pulling this ridiculous book off our bookshelf and opening it. This book is a ""complete"" joke. The writing is muddled, the layout and font are awful, and the examples are repeatedly copied and pasted to fluff up the book and make it look respectable. I would be astonished if there was a worse book out there."
1,Not Worth the Money,"It says on the back blurb that the author has written 35 computer books. It's pretty easy to see why. Of 500 pages, perhaps 20 have useful content. The remaining pages show the authors skill with the copy and paste keys. The samples are trivial, repetitive, and do not build on the material previously introduced. Never mind the fact that they don't even compile. It's been a while since I felt like demanding my money back on a technical book.Save your money."
1,Perhaps the worst computer book ever published.,"This book is unimaginably bad. It's so bad, in fact, that I have to laugh. It does get a good start, moving through 15 pages of introductory material, then gets bogged down in so much bureaucratic (not technical) terminology that it seems the author doesn't even understand it. Anyone who knows Java can look at his listings and know that they won't compile as printed, perhaps the author doesn't understand Java either. And the wasted space... Oh man! Entire listings are pointlessly explained line by line, with each showing up on a longer and longer listing. And how about those screen shots-- line drawings with courier font for buttons? Is this a first draft or something? Steven Holzner should never be allowed to write another computer book."
5,Aroma therapy all day Long!,I have sampled every wonderful scent made by this brand! Best used in an area where there is breeze to circulate the aroma....fan or an ion air clean/ breeze machine.I have one of these in every room in my house! Jasmine is also delightful.I keep the inside of the fragrance ccan a little moist every few days so the scent will last longer.Great in the car too...You will not be disappointed!
1,Wish it would ship so I could find out.,"Ordered 27JAN05, with an expected ship date in ""up to"" 2 Weeks.On 16FEB05, received an email from amazon.com that I needed to check my order. Now ship date is 11MAR05, if you care to believe that.Other vendors are quoting immediate ship. Amazon you let me down on this one."
1,Really didn't work,"We tried to get this to work for almost 6 months and finally gave up. With fresh batteries, sensetivity set to high and receiver close to transmitter it worked only about 50% of the time."
2,What kind of battery does it take?,"Coast has an unfortunate habit of not including battery type in their product descriptions, perhaps because their products don't take standard AA, AAA, C or D cells. Based upon another description, this one apparently takes N cells. An earlier version that I bought took two C123 (camera) batteries.The blue lights are beautiful, but not beautiful enough to justify the additional cost and trouble."
4,Good but not great (EDIT--Better upon further review),"I was surprised by the amount of information and length of this series. Both positives. However, I did not find anything exceptional in these CDs. Good, solid information but not exceptional. I did enjoy his presentation and demeanor however.If you purchase the CDs I don't think you will be disappointed if your expectations are not too high.EDIT--I have now listened to these CDs several times and I have appreciated them more and more each time. I am also in the process of reading No Beginning No End by the same author and it is a good book."
4,A very thrilling joyride,When i first looked at tyhis book in the library i took it out because it looked like the genre that i preffered and i was right the book was like a thrilling rollercoaster ride from beginning to end and there was not those dry bits in between events where the reader doesnt understand what the author wants . the book is basically about a town where 3 children dissappear and the cause is somehting dark that happened 20 years before. I enjoyed the book thoroughly although i found that the ending could have been a bit better
3,I finished the book but probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends.,"I didn' like all the negative issues that were related to racism, etc., even though it is part of history. this book took me by surprise after reading the other books by Dave and/or Neta Jackson. I enjoyed the part about basketball but not Hitler and communism."
1,watch out,We bought the PH4-13R-01 about a year ago. We used it for about 4 months in the summer and had a few instances where it blew the circuit breaker but no other problems. We didn't use it in the winter. This summer it didn't work. It wouldn't turn on. I looked in one of the vents and saw a lot of broker pieces. The problem was the plastic turbine blower had shattered.Now I am trying to find a replacement part but I don't believe they sell them. Also I found an article about a recall for their space heater sold on QVC because the poor quality of the parts used created a fire hazard. I believe my broken blower is one of their poor quality parts
5,An understandable book on reducing business taxes,"Full of good ideas conveyed with a clear writing style, this book gives readers lots of good, concrete examples of how different businesses can reduce their tax burden. I was looking to create a new company and wanted to figure out which type of company was right for me (partnership, LLC, Chapter S, or C Corp). By following the examples in the book, I was able to zero in on the right organization for my consulting business. I have no doubt that when it is all said and done, I will have saved thousands of dollars by reading this excellent book."
2,Mr Coffee Drip Coffee Maker,The product stopped working after a few months of normal use. I never had any trouble with Mr Coffee products in the past and have owned several over the years.
3,after using it for 6 months,"Overall not a bad shoe for the price, the buckle can come off at times and does too..Soles wear out pretty quick, definetly needs some inserts.Light, easy on maintanence...good one.."
3,Too small for my shoes.,"The shoes were great, but 1-1/2 inch longer than my current 9.5M leather slip-on dress shoes."
3,Made for a 5lb or smaller dog,Not quiet as big as described. My dog was not happy with this so I used it as a pillow on a chair. The grips on the back were a nice add to help with slipping although very minimal.
2,"Interesting subject, lousy writing style","Rumsfeld is one of the most interesting individuals in politics in recent years. But this book is so poorly written it is worthless. It is certainly no critical analysis, and is very shallow. Rumsfeld is obviously a much more complex man than this cutesy book would indicate. The writing style is so distracting I keep losing the purpose of the book. Save your money and hope for a better biography of Rumsfeld in the future. I gave the book two stars because I think Rumsfeld is an extremely interesting subject. I would give the author a zero minus."
2,What kind of battery does it take?,"Coast uses exotic (i.e., expensive) batteries in its lights. I bought one for my daughter, and it turned out to use a camera battery. You'll be better off with one that uses standard (i.e., C or D cell) batteries. They are available from other manufacturers. Note that Coast does not specify the battery type in its descriptions. Not good."
5,great movie,this movie is the best by far haa. love these two together. the movie was not damaged or scratched at all and arrived super fast!
4,I WOULD'VE RATED 5 STARS IF ONLY BECAUSE OF GERARD BUTLER,Aside from all the vulgar langauge and sexual insinuations/references etc that I could've done without I would've rated it higher. I did not really care for the orgasm scene at the restaurant. Not everyone's kind of humor. But I did enjoy the movie overall. I like how SHE kept a list of everything she was looking for in a man and wound up falling in love with the kind of man she didn't want. And how HE gave her tips and advise to get the man she wanted only to find out he was falling in love with her. My favorite scene is when she sort let her hair down and danced salsa with him. I don't think this everyone's kind of movie. But then everyone has different tastes. This movie was recommended to me by a friend but another friend didn't like it. So you would just have to watch it and see for yourself. I love Gerard Butler and as always Gerard did a great job. I think he is amazing and proves he can play any kind of role.
3,"Another example of an interesting idea, not carried out well...","I like Katherine Heigl. I like Gerard Butler. When I heard they were going to be in a movie together, I thought ""That's Great!"" However, this movie is joining up with an increasingly long line of recent films that have an interesting idea but they can't carry out well. I mean, don't get me wrong, It's decent. I gave it 3 stars, it is worth a rental. I just thought it would be better. I think that maybe Katherine Heigl just wasn't right in her role as Abby. That is probably what I think is just a little off. Gerard fit in his role as Mike Chadway, host of The Ugly Truth, a cable access show that gets picked up as a segment on the morning program in which Abby produces. It's pretty obvious what happens next. Check it out for yourself on a day when you have ..... Nothing better to do."
4,Not for juveniles,"It's rare to find an adult comedy these days. By adult I don't mean sleazy, or related to the adult entertainment market. In fact, there is a refreshing lack of gratuitous nudity in this movie. It is rated ""R"", but the rating comes from the excellent writing. Writing that aims not at the typical late-teen audience, but functioning adults.Like most comedies, this is not high art. But the combination of smart writing and two engaging stars makes it a joy to watch, even in repeated viewings. The supporting cast helps a lot, but the two headliners do carry the movie and elevate it above yet another mindless romp in the often complicated field of human relations.A rarity among current offerings from an ever-increasing out-of-touch film industry."
4,The Ugly Truth is pretty good,"This movie was on our daughter's Christmas wish list, she was so happy to open it on Christmas morning and we've all enjoyed watching it. Kathryn Heigl and Gerard Butler were wonderful. Light, fun, enjoyable."
5,"Classic romantic comedy, fun to watch","If you're a fan of other movies with Katherine Heigel and Gerard Butler, this one won't disappoint. It's predictable but isn't that what we all love about romantic comedies? You do have to get past the Butler character's crassness and wait for the softer side to be revealed. I don't think most women would wait around to eventually discover that (and most men wouldn't be able to handle the Heigel character's neurosis - a typical Heigel character) but that's why it's a movie and not reality. There's more comedy pulled off well by a strong cast of supporting characters. I enjoyed the comedy and love/hate relationship that wraps up in typical romantic comedy fashion."
2,The leads have no sexual chemistry!,"In a movie that is billed as a ""sexy, romantic comedy"", don't your main characters have to actually be sexy and romantic together? Because I may be alone in this but I thought their chemistry was severely lacking. They are beautiful people but with no spark whatsoever! And Katherine Heigl - Lord I used to love her until I realized she plays the exact same character in every movie! There were a few parts in the movie that made me giggle but mostly it was pretty lame!"
3,Light entertainment,"The Ugly Truth is a romantic comedy that provides amusing, light entertainment. Nothing too new, nothing unpredictable. I recommend renting or borrowing this title if you wish to see it. Don't invest in it as a purchase."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"Crass and at times pretty disgusting. Surprised to see Katherine Heigle agreed to act in this movie, I would think her above it. So many other better movies out there, don't waste your time and $$$."
2,Chick Flick By the Numbers,This was pretty funny but it was just the same old formula chick flick I have seen a million times. I knew as soon as I started watching it that it was written by a woman. It wasn't bad just the same old by the numbers chick flick with some crude humor for the guys and Sex and the City ladies.
5,Excellent build quality - great product,"This harness is well built, the connector fits perfectly and feels like its made of strong durable material. The wires are clearly labeled, color coded, have quality insulation and have pre cut ends. All of the pins have have been clamped to the wire's insulation resulting in a strong secure connection."
2,Not enough pawns!,"I ordered this chess set for my fiancé for the Holiday, and it arrived short one pawn. I ended up exchanging it for a new one with the proper amount of pieces, but it was stressful and annoying. I do not recommend it."
4,Nice set but clasp good be better designed,The set is nice and light (good travel set). Wish they had put the closure clasp in another location. The pieces are big enough but a little on the light side - good for the price.
3,Great product,"great product - Pieces are too small. Very neatly packaged, though! I was going to use it to teach some children but looks like I have to buy another board"
5,Folding Chess set.,"Loved it. I almost didn't order it because there were some negative reviews. Okay, others say the elastics inside won't hold the chess pieces - who would use those anyway? The box was great, and the pieces, though not weighted, make this wooden chess set worth every penny. Nice going, Amazon."
3,A decent chess set,"This set is OK. The board, is 14 3/4 inches square. It looks nice when it is open, but doesn't close completely even when latched (there is about a 1/8 inch gap on one side.) This may just be a problem with the one I got, but it bugs me a little. What bugs me alot is that the elastic that holds the pieces in place on the inside broke after about the 4th time it was used. Now 3 of the pieces are always loose inside when the set is closed.The chessmen are wood. They are not very detailed, but they aren't bad. The king is 3 inches tall and about 1 inch in diameter at the base. Honestly, the pieces look a little small on the board to me, but you can always get bigger pieces.If you're looking for a decent chess set that folds up and keeps everything in one place (even if the pieces rattle around inside), I'd say this was a pretty good set."
2,Didn't work for me,"I purchased the IR-350 IR Repeater, the IR-100 Receiver, the DV9-500 Power Supply, and four IR-E1 IR Flashers and installed in the oak cabinet that houses my home theater components. The repeater worked only intermittently and without any discernible cause for its random failure. I did ultimately determine that the greatest cause of interference was the TV itself - not helpful. It's worth pointing out that the interference was not reflected light but radio noise.Another nit would be that the installation instructions are poorly written and Buffalo's website offers nothing more.I purchased these items from Home Controls and they have been fair and square with me about it. I'm just sorry I invested the effort and drilled a hole in my cabinet. And, yes, I tested the unit before drilling the hole."
4,Not for use with LCD and Plasma TVs,"LCD TVs and Plasma TVs need special infared receivers to work correctly with them, otherwise they are overwhelmed with interference. Compact Fluorescent bulbs also can cause these not to work. Of course the special Plasma versions and LCD/CFL versions are much more expensive and somewhat less sensitive."
3,some people may like it,I personally found them to taste a bit like sour gummybears wrapped in flat cream soda but I can imagine there are people that would enjoy these anyway.btw texture is chewy like hi-chew on the outside but inside are hard chewy pieces and something that crunches a little??
4,The girlfriend loved them,My girlfriend loved these. They are very good quality. They were also a good match for a pendant that I had purchased previously.
2,so so,"I should have read others reviews... definitely not his best live performance... Not your typical REK live, and didn't perform any of his better works..."
3,A Couple of Good Performances,"This dvd has a couple of good performances, but a lot that I would skip over for future viewings. If the price is right it's enjoyable, but don't break the bank for it."
2,Not practical,"This umbrella is extremely heavy and when we took it to the beach, we couldn't sit by the water because it obstructed the lifeguard's view."
5,Great Umbrella,"I was very impressed with how sturdy this umbrella is and would definitely consider buying a second one. You'll need an anchor though... in windy weather, this large umbrella can pull away!"
5,Perfect for the beach,Well made and nice to take to the beach. It does have a plastic screw that burrows into the sand. Good size.
1,Never Received,I placed an order for this umbrella on May 31 with a promised delivery by June 9th. It is now June 14th and no umbrella. I have contacted the company several times and all they can say is that it is going to ship ASAP. I have canceled the order and will now shop else where.
4,"Great Umbrella, But.............","Heavy duty fiberglass ribs as opposed to the thin steel ones that rust out and bend when blown by the wind. Vented top also prevents umbella from being pulled up and away by the wind. Bottom pole can be driven into soft sand facing the wind and you should be OK. If you are on a lawn or a beach with hard sand, you really need an umbrella with an auger/cork screw pole tip, which this model does not have. A seperate pole holder that will accept this large diameter pole could also be used to anchor it. 8' umbrella casts a huge cool shadow to sit under, but unless care is taken, it could blow away."
1,Easily Broken,It was a nice umbrella until the pole connectors snapped w/o much force. Way too flimsy unless you prefer beach umbrellas you have to treat like a china doll.
5,What's the Big Deal?,"Okay, some author writes a book about Marriages, Relationships and Love. Love is an complicated issue, and my last marriage last one year. There will always be problems with women and men, because no one tryly understands what it is too love. Raymoni Love helps bridges the gap between the those who get caught up with the games and heartache of dating and relationships. The review by jimmy, should be ignored, becasue what was he doing buying a book if he has all the answers about love and dating. he can't find love, and refuse to grasp the reality that some people need hard truths to get past the games and heartache of someone playing with their emotions. Raymoni Love may be misunderstood to some, like Spike Lee is to the OSCARS, however he is another african-american success that wants to entertain. I have the book, and I have his other book as well, and will soon buy his next book that I've heard is coming out in June of 2006. Peace!"
2,Wow ......,"I wanted to like this book, but upon reading it was shocked it was ever published. The author attempts to make some valid points and if you can read through the horrible grammar, lack of proofing, inconsistent font types, and profanity there are actually a few jewels of useful knowledge in the book. I think an effective writing course and an editor would do wonders for the author. I have to say the reference to Leon Phelps was really funny though (from Jimmy). I read the first half of the book (which is for ladies) then skipped on to the male section. Much of the book is actually duplication from each portion. I was overall very disapppointed, and it's difficult to take an author as an authority on any topic if they are unable to effectively communicate their thoughts."
5,Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret ..,Michael Carroll has done a tremendous job in writing this book. Having dealt with Lyme disease for the past 10 years makes one leery of what Lab 257 is doing. Is Lyme disease a US Government Coverup? A terrible mistake? An accident or a planned release of a bacteria that may be the cause of untold millions of illnesses. Why hasn't the US Government come up with an accurate test for Lyme disease? This book should be in every library and on everyone's reading list.
1,The bigget bunk I have ever heard!,"As an intern at Plum Island during the time of his supposed research, he gets everything wrong about the actual research going on, and has clearly never been there. One only needs to ask and agree to quarantine restrictions to protect US farm animals in order to be invited in and have a tour. If he can't handle staying away from a farm for 6 months, he is not much of a researcher! He even uses fiction to support his ""research""."
3,worthy songs,"While most of these songs are not classic memorable tunes, there are a few song that certainly demonstrate musical genius. Ray Charles shows his amazing capabilities as a pianist, as well as a fairly unknown artist Les McCann. However, perhaps the finest work on this collection is Summertime by the Modern Jazz Quartet. Milt Jackson, who plays with the Modern Jazz Quartet, is surely the undisputed king of the vibraphone, one certainly worthy of the title Jazz Giant."
5,The best book I have ever had it is changing my life completely,If you are craving for success and you want to take control of your own life. This is a must have reference.
2,no Reason to buy this,"i am only goin by the reason cause thats all i heard and i thought it was pretty good. got sick of it pretty quickly tho, quicker than most songs.also something for the most common society out there: the mtv haters - so many of u all saying the same things about how this is pop (which it is) so stay away from it. it amazes me when people like music and just having other people liking it turns them off a band. u should enjoy sharing ur tastes with other people."
2,THe definition of average,"THis has a couple good songs, but after awhile it begins to sound like the c.d. is on repeat because every song is EXACTLY THE SAME!! IT truly is amazing that a band with this potential could make such an ordinary album that follows the path of every other ""modern"" rock band. Just about every hit worthy modern rock band, with its forced melodies and songs that are made for the sake of a hit or a reason to headbang, sounds like Hoobastank and vice Versa. THis album has no vision, no style, it's all the same thing over and over. Maybe the name of the band does give them a clue to what they themselves think: Hooba Stanks."
3,The Reason got me to buy this album!,The Reason is a great song and it led me to buy the album.There are a few good songs on here but there are many fillers which means there are a deal of bad songs on this album also!
4,not AS good,"i have to admitt, being a huge hoobastank fan that this album wasn't AS good as the first but i still enjoy listening to it very much. I think i remember reading someone's review, they made it sound as if all the songs were the same and they all meant the same thing. All i have to say to him is READ THE LYRICS JACKASS! Ne ways, i think this album was very good. i heard this new stuff way before the new album dropped and even then i thought the sound was addictive. I get the music stuck in my head all the time. i would definitly recomend a hoobastank fan buy it or even someone that listens to similar music. i just now got my friend out of liking pop bull, and into listening to music from Brand New, Default, Taking Back Sunday and so on. definite recomendation."
1,The Reason? Because it stinks!,"It's my fault. I feel into a trap that hasn't gotten me in many years. After seeing the video for 'The Reason' on VH1 a couple of times, I went and bought the album at a local retailer. (Sorry Amazon, Target has your prices beat 90% of the time)For people like me who expect a band to at least stay within genre, this album was a thorough disappointment. I should have downloaded the single and said to heck with the album.Be warned, listen to at least 5 tracks on this CD before you decide to buy!"
1,So bad,"Could the lyrics be any more trite? ""You're not a perfect person?"" Yeah, lemme guess, ""you're only human...""Could the ""hook"" be any easier to play? Doodeedoodeedoodeedooee...Could the video have any less to do with the song? Yeah, a jewel heist. That's what this song makes me think of... a jewel heist. Yeah.Could the band name be any more disgusting? I think it's a play on ""stinky hooka"" or ""stinky hooker"" but I'm sure some devoted fan will set me straight...All in all, I don't understand why this waste of time and space continues to receieve attention or air time."
3,Bought for One Song,"I just love 'Reason' and I bought the CD for this song only. The rest is a bit 'heavy' for me, but it was worth it!"
2,Pretty bland,"*sigh* another disapointing release. Hoobastank's debut album was strong and full of great tracks. This album just isn't. The title track is lame, the single ""Out Of Control"" has horrible flow, and I really can't find a standout track on the entire album.I mean its decent but its definitly not something I'm going to listen to a bunch of times, it doesn't stick with you. Unlike the last one, this isn't a CD that's going to stay in your head.I know this band can do better."
4,"A ""Must Read""","This book should be a ""must read"" for all of our elected officials, clergy and health care workers. It lends rational views as to why we NEED to ""alcoholize"" our presently illegal drugs. The book gives an interesting, easy to read history of past epidemics from the beginning of written history, and how the various cultures and societies dealt with them. A fascinating review of the syphilis epidemic in this century reveals the flaws in our present methods of controlling the AIDS epidemic."
5,Mantis Electric Tiller,"I purchased this electric model for my husband, who has shoulder problems. He has tried it and seems to like the way it handles. It works best in soil that has already been cultivated. He uses it mainly in his garden plot and flower beds."
2,Mantis tiller duty cycle,"The electric tiller -- a basically good machine -- uses an under-rated DC motor with an under-rated rectifier (AC to DC converter)(should be ~25-30A vs 10A) with no electrolytic capacitor on the DC (output) side of the rectifier to reduce motor brush arcing. The motor overheats far too easily. The shroud is not opened enough to allow air in, nor is there a motor shaft fan to circulate it. Motor casing cooling fins might help. These factors, in part, cause the duty cycle to be about 30', even on a 60 degree day, which then drops to 2' cycles until the motor cools for more than an hour. Incidentally, the ""support"" people at Mantis, when queried, did not know what the term ""duty cycle"" means. Other than these factors, when the machine ""wants to work,"" it does a good job. Too bad it doesn't have a good 1/2 HP AC motor with good cooling instead of the DC drive."
2,Too many conspiracies.,"The stories in the universe of ""Agent of Vega"" are passable, but I found that the author likes conspiracies a little too much. Some of them, like in ""Gone Fishing"" are both inherently creepy and presented as protagonists, which if frankly disturbing. The stories, with the exception of a horror-short ""Greenface"" are very convoluted and strongly based on revelations that the characters are not privy to, which make them difficult to be involved with."
1,Fast Knits Fat Needles,"Did not like this book. Returned. As an experienced knitter, who teaches and designs, I found this book unusable. I do buy alot of book online with out seeing them first. This was the first time a ever looked at a book that was terrible. The pictures of the items that were to be knitted only showed you part of the item. The layout was bad. It didn't draw you in to want to make any thing. This was the worst knitting book I ever saw. Did not give me any ideas, as I a usally get from any book and/or magazine. All my student felt same way. We all could not figure out want items were being made."
1,Are you ashamed of your book?,"WHY agree to allow a peak into the book, and not actually show anything??!!??I purchase knitting books based upon wanting instructions for one or more of the items pictured.NO PICTURES - NO PURCHASE !"
1,This LeBra does not fit my vehicle,"This product clearly states that it fits a buick century 1995-2001, but it does not even come close to matching the contour of the vehicle"
3,Pieces may crack but the book is good,"I got this set and book two christmases ago. I feel that the book is good if you need to learn how the pieces move and a little bit about how to use simple strategies (it is very basic). After two years I have only had one of the pieces form a crack and used glue on it, so it was no big deal. I ended getting a regular staunton tournament set that was solid anyway.For the price this is still not a bad deal if you plan to eventually upgrade your set, and the book anyway. Don't expect anything fancy."
3,Book Rocks the Set Rolls,"I like the book. It gives me a lot of information and is worth four stars. Sometimes the book is a little hard to understand but still mostly very good.The chess set is certainly cheaply made. But then again it is not designed for tournament use, but just to get you by with the book."
4,Great hands-on book and game for kids,"Fun book that taught my 6 year-old son not only to play chess, but the story behind the games, its pieces and its strategy. He is now teaching me to play. The game board shows how each piece may move, which is a helpful aid."
3,good book,since I bought the book used for next to nothing I am not too disappointed in not getting the chess set with it as advertised. My son had me read the entire book in one sitting and is not so patiently wating for a chess set we ordered later to arrive. If the chess set had come with this I would have given it a 5 star rating. My son really enjoyed it and the explanations are fantastic.
1,"Worse than ""I Sing"" by same author","I got both books as a gift when a relative met the author and he suggested that they would make a good birthday present for me (some objective referral).Both books are horrible, but this one is by far the worst.I might just cut the spine and cover off this book and glue it to a different one. This way if my relative stops over she sees the title on my bookshelf and think it's not in the dumpster where it belongs."
4,Pinpointed the Problem,"Moody accurately captures the confusion, competition and corruption of the VRD circle -- as a VRD inventor myself I found the comments about Rutkowski as corrupt accurate -- was a bit surprised that he missed a few characters -- the MIT circle in particular. It provides an excellent lesson in Shakespearean intrigue and corporate politics."
2,Meh,Wasn't really impressed with these remixes. Mostly acquired it due to a 'gotta have the whole collection' reaction.
2,For children.,"I purchased this thinking it would contain word searches for the adult mind and instead received a very large book with enormous font, childish pictures, very small word searches and easy words.This was obviously meant for children. Not necessarily a waste of money, but definitely not what I wanted."
4,Nice throwback movie,"I remember seeing this as a kid & loving it and something struck me to want to see it again as an adult. Although it's not as 'awesome' as I remembered it, it was still nice to see this throwback movie"
1,Stainless steel pot NOT ok for stovetop,"I bought this teapot thinking you could warm the water in it, stick in the infuser and have tea five minutes later. Only upon opening the package did I find out that because it has a plastic handle it is NOT Ok for stovetop. The manufacturer's response was: well we never said it IS ok for the stovetop so it is not our problem. They agreed to take it back but made me pay shipping both ways. Watch out for items on Amazon that are not being sold directly by Amazon but rather are being sold by a third party."
5,Remember When!,"This performance reminded me of Love in its Truest form.Going through college and dealing with the emotions of relationships.""A House Is Not A Home"" How many of us remember that song!Luther sang that song like I would have, when I was going through my thang."
5,He is the man and he is missed,Luther Luther Luther sangs he behind off. The superstar/house is not a home half hour is worth more than the price of this DVD. If you've never experienced Luther live or if your a Luther fan this DVD is excellent.
5,In Love Again!!!,"Luther Vandross apitomizes the title ""Crooner"". He is involved in every song in detail. His stage presence is extraordinary. His background singers are second to none. His songs are all about situations that happens in the everyday life of love, heartbreak and reconcilliation. This DVD I recommend to all Luther fans young and old. Get back in love! Listen to this DVD and dance to it also. Rating: Five Stars+"
2,Not for beginners,"MaDonna Grimes can afford to take a course on how to teach beginners. She jumps into the act as though the`beginner already knows the steps and can start them right off as she does? Too much! I definitely would not recommend this to beginners, but find a better trainer in dancing steps instead."
2,Workout? Yah right! Dance instructional? Yah right!,"I mean, she is pretty hot so that's cool, but don't expect much of a workout or much of a dance lesson!I would save your money and just get a REAL dance instructional where you can learn to dance on your own and then THAT will be your workout!The best ones I have found areHow To Do The Robot - Breakdance Instructional DVDorTop 20 Breakdance Moves. These are the cream of the crop!Good luck!"
2,NOT for beginners,I chose this dvd because it stated it was for beginners. This is not at all beginner friendly. MaDonna Grimes does not allowyou time to get the step before she is introducing another step. She goes entirely too fast. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
4,Burns the Unwanted Calories,Take it slow if you have not excercised for a while. Does help burn calories as seen in the sweat produced. Lost 7 pounds in one month doing the DVD 3 times per week at a slow pace.
3,HipHop dance,"I received the DVD quick- I thought I was getting beginner Zumba- so was surprised, but I liked the hip hop. However, I got bored with it very fast. A lot of repetition to learn the dance steps. Wished there was more music/variety to work out with. Glad I didn't spend anymore money on it."
3,"I Couldn't Put it Down, But.....","The Last Goodbye is a gripping, compelling read--but I have to say that after finishing it, I felt kind of like ""Is that all there is?"" The story is essentially a good one--down on his luck lawyer's old friend dies of an overdose, or does he? Friend investigates the murder, with the help of a cyberpunk client and discovers web of lies and deceit, while he may be falling in love with dead friend's obsessive love. The dialogue works, the writing is good, but certain elements of the plot just didn't ring true and overall the plot seems like a rehash of other novels. Still--this book would certainly be a fine companion on a long plane flight or in a boring waiting room--it will provide an excellent diversion--just not one you would feel like talking with your book club about."
5,Wonderful Light,"All those little lites that use the AA bateries that you put on your key chain are dim, in comparison to this little beauty, literaly.It is compact Relativly light weight and makes a bright circle of light for what ever need you have. It has tremendous battery life and can come in handy in many situations. Use it around the house, or anywhere else because its small and compact. Also durable and don't worry about it getting just a little wet in the rain because thats not likly to hurt it too much. Also when you drop your keys and the parking lot and the flashlight breaks it bulb well won't happen with this wonderful little gadget it's bulb will last longer than you will and its shock resistant as well."
2,Trash,"I put this one down in the middle then skimmed it to the end just to find out what happens. This is a story about the carnal quests and infidelities of two self-absorbed, narcisistic English guys. The problem is, for every line of in-the-present plot movement there's two or three paragraphs, if not PAGES, of cutesy, Seinfeld/ stand-up comedy type reflection on the nature of men and relationships. It's nothing new, and most of it is better suited to a sitcom or comedy club. There are some laughs, for sure, but you have to wade through so much trash to find them."
1,What is it with these new British novels?,Overwritten and overwrought. An uninteresting book about wildly uninteresting people whose unexamined lives are better left to themselves.
2,In Bad Taste,"I feel the humor was sometimes in very bad taste. The total disregard for morals and religion by the characters was annoying throughout the book. The only thing that saved it was the somewhat surprising ending. The reader has a twinge of hope from the beginning, but loses it when seemingly concrete evidence is given and is surprised and pleased by the redemption of that hope."
4,Solid Jimmy Stewart movie...in Canada!,"I'd like to give this movie 5 stars, but it's a solid 4. Set during the Alaska gold rush and spilling into Dawson Creek, Canada, Jimmy walks the tightwire between civics and solitude as the story comes to a tightly balanced conclusion. Beautiful secenery in Jasper National park. The Canadian Western!"
3,What happened to letterbox version?,"If you're familiar with Jimmy Stewart westerns, than there's nothing to be said about this one. If you're not, than become a fan and see why we like Jimmy Stewart westerns. This is one of the many great '50's heyday westerns. The usual triumphant loner beats all. One of my favorites. My only beef is, ""what happened to the letterbox version""?"
4,The Far Country,"Another great DVD The Far Coubtry James Stewart and (Anthony Mann director). James Stewart is great once again, the scenery is superb, a good story about a rough town, gold happy claim jumpers and shoot outs.When things are out of controll Stewart takes charge in a hge shoot out. This completes my James Stewart collection,recomend this DVD.M.Innes Australia."
2,Almost but not quite,"At first the book is thrilling but is a Jules Verne's copy""cat"". On the other hand who'd think that America will be peaceful while attacking his first out-of-Earth satellite? Do you think that an artificial satellite is at 4,000 miles above the Earth? It's at least at 22,000 miles above us. Other things maybe are or not truth or just Sci-Fi. But no matter if this book was written about 60 years ago. ML must had known some answers that were not written by JV.Do you know what was JV's mistake in his book ""From the Earth to the Moon""?He failed about 150 Miles from where he did the launch. Cape Canaveral is about this distance. And the best thing is that scientists think that it was because the angle of Earth at his time."
3,Works,It seems to work okay but the temperature setting is proving to be a bit tricky. I have not been able to get it set quite right yet but I am close.
1,Cheap!,"Just got a new tank last night and was really happy to see everything come together.....until i put this crap in my tank, this morning i woke up just to see glass from the heater all over my tank.Ill say this....if you have the money to start a hobby then do it rite and dont by this heater...ive learned my lesson."
1,This heater is death.,"Purchased this from a local pet shop. Twice now the thing has malfunctioned, frying half the fish in my tank. The first time I thought maybe a jerk acquaintance of mine had messed with it, so I didn't think to check it, but now I know for sure that it's the heater itself, and it's going in the garbage. Do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks now, or you'll be spending a lot more later to repopulate your tank."
3,Nice Job!,"If you enjoy watching R rated movies, with story lines, nudity, and flirting behavior buy these video. If not buy PlayBoy's Girls Behaving Badly."
2,Disappointing,"This is a really lame effort from Playboy. The pacing is slow, the camera actions too jerky, and the girls spend far too much time dressed and not nearly enough time naked. Kelly Monaco and Kalin Olsen are curvy, nicely-built girls, but all they do is jump into a pond and have a picnic with a sleepwalking male model. A smart director would have gone for a down & dirty threesome -- they could at least coaxed Kelly and Kalin into having some explicit, well light lesbian sex. A complete tease."
1,Worst PB Video Ever,"Takes 10 minutes just to get to the action, and it is not very good action either...buy Girlfriends or something else, not this one..."
4,Every bit worthy of the name playboy.,"Incredible women and incredible scenery. The curves are curvey and the women are wonderful. As always Playboy comes through by not only showing beautiful women, but it uses some of the worlds best photography to do it. An enjoyable piece of art."
3,What a nightmare,"As much as I wanted to love this product, it didn't happen. I deliberately purchased it (in black) to intensify the dark color of my son's hair, for Halloween. It did relatively good job at it, but.... while I sprayed it on his hair, a ton if it landed on the floor. You don't really see it there right away, but if you wear white socks - they would be irrepairably ruined if you walk on that floor. That's one part of why I can leave only 3 stars. The other part is trying to wash it all out. I had it in black color, so I had to wash his hair 7 times to get it all out. It is somewhat greese based so everything that I would shampoo out would land and stick to his skin, making him look like he's just got out of a chimney. And it's very hard to get it off the skin. His poor entire body was ash-grey color, along with the bath tub and water. He was screaming the entire time, not understanding why I am scrubbing him so many times. What a nightmare."
2,Buy this book only if you are Eiffel programmer,"I agree with Michael. This book is written for Eiffelprogrammers. This book does not add anything to GoF,it just contains more code written in Eiffel.But for a non Eiffel programmer, the code is not easy tounderstand at all. If you need more code for GoF patterns,and you happen to be a Java programmer or understand Java,tryApplied Java Patternsby Stephen A. Stelting, Olav MaassenISBN: 0130935387This book is much more clear and it contains complete code in Java.If you are a C++ programmer, GoF is still useful.For VB programmer, there is a good bookMicrosoft Visual Basic Design Patterns (Microsoft Professional Series)by William StamatakisISBN: 1572319577DanSr. Software Developer,Sun Certified Java Programmer, DeveloperIBM Certified Developer for XML and related technologies"
1,Not as described,"I purchased this item due to the advertised ability to fit both 5/8"" and 1"" arbors. It is only bored for 5/8"". The description on the packaging had been altered with white-out to cover up the ""and 1 inch"". Pretty shady. It should be much easier to delete that verbiage from your electronic description, rather than pay someone to cover up the packaging description. I can see and feel tooling marks in the surface of the plate (both sides), and it is bare aluminum, not coated like the pictures show. You get 1 star because both of the 5/8"" bores fit on my 5/8"" arbor."
4,"Micro Convenience, but a few issues.","This is a great little DVD player, emphasis on ""little."" It's my bedroom player and has many convenient features, but I have only one issue. The machine turns off if paused for 10 minutes, and whenever it is turned off it does not ""resume"" from the last play point. So I constantly have to check the chapter to make sure. Also on the Philips site it advertises 5-disc resume, but as I stated it doesn't resume even 1 disc. The other minot issue is that the display button is next to the power button, and both are like colores and the same size and dimension, so I sometimes turn off the DVD player unexpectedly. Not an issue if it were not for the lack of ""resume"" feature. Other than that it is a flexible and top-quality machine."
5,Great mustard,"I made everyone in my family mustard for Christmas last year with this product and it was a big success, so I am making it again this year. Highly recommended, as is the yellow mustard."
4,Great toy!,"My 3 year old absolutely loves this toy! He is a huge fan of the movie and this looks exactly like the workshop in the movie. It also talks and sounds just like the voices in the movie, which my son thinks is amazing. This far exceeded my expectations."
5,Touching. Beautiful. Clean.,"An engrossing story set in a beautiful yet formidable place. Not preachy, just a story with Christian characters doing what they believe in. How refreshing to watch a film you don't have to cover your childrens' eyes for when raunch appears on the screen. Pure story. Hollywood should take note."
2,The other side of heaven in spanish,"The quality of the dubbing of this video was very poor. Poor translation, some parts showed the english and spanish subtitles overlapping each other and it almost seems like that was a pirated film remade by a local company. I would never recommend this firm to anyone."
3,dougv,A decent movie about a missionary.Be advised that the story is about a Mormon missionary.The movie does show his dedication to his cause.
2,condition not as expected,"The condition report made no mention of the sloppy underlining in this book. The outside of the book is clean and in new condition, the inside not so much."
4,Overall a good pick.,"Needed this book for summer reading project for my 8 year old daughter. Paperback in perfect new condition. The story kept my daughters attention through-out. It pushed her to learn some new vocabulary, but wasn't too hard where she lost the storyline."
2,I HAVE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LIKE THE SONGS IN IT.,SUPERB CLASSIC LOVE SONGS PERFECT TO LISTEN ON A DAY LIKE THE VALENTINES DAY SPECIALY WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE MOST IN THE WORLD.WELL I BADLY WANT TO OWN THIS FANTASTIC LOVE SONGS CD TO LISTEN TO.YOU CAN RELAX AS WELL AS HAVE A NICE TIME LISTENING TO THIS ONE.SO I GIVE IT 1000 STARS IF I CAN.
4,"Works well, but you need to be careful","I ordered this along with the Luigi Bormioli Esperienze 88-Ounce Decanter, and basically they work well together. However, I broke my Luigi Bormioli Esperienze 88-Ounce Decanter when placing it on the drying rack. It slipped a bit and the neck of the decanter hit the stainless steel shaft of the drying rack causing the decanter to crack and break. So be careful...and I will, too!As I said, basically it works well. Just be careful when resting your decanter against the shaft of the drying rack. If I allow my new decanter to rest against the drying rack shaft, I might try placing a paper towel as an insulator between the two."
1,Not as advertised,Product did not perform as advertised. Lasted only two weeks under normal use not the three months advertised. Product seemed to be old and outdated I cannot verify as there was no date on the package. When purchased last through a chain store it performed as it should have. Will not buy through mail order again.
5,love this product,"It was a bit expensive to start but the cartridges last a long time. It's not messy, doesn't stain and helps my septic at the same time. The manufacturer says it's sold in stores but I can't find anyone who carries this product."
5,Pure Intelligence,"I have personally met Stephen Buckle. He is currently my Philosophy lecturer at Australian Catholic University. The combination of reading this book as well as attending his stimulating classes has given me insight into Pure Intelligence. Which is what Stephen has. Pure. Intelligence. A lovely man too, very worldly and a pleasure to know."
2,Not the right fit,"This is a well made product and feels comfortable in my hand - however, it was too small to fit on my exercize bicycle seat. I read other reviews saying it fit their seats, so I gave it a try, but it was too small. I openned the draw string as wide as it could go and it still didn't fit."
3,Good and soft,"Very easy to install and I love how soft my workouts are, I hate having hair on my pants but I change and it sometimes is very itchy."
2,you get what you pay for.,Did not fit exercycle at the fitness center. Took a shot and lost. Would like to have known dimensions before purchase.
4,helps,i got for my large beehine for my indoor excercise bike and its very comfortable and worth the price ok
5,Good,the book is good; the purchase process is fast; and the kindle version is very convenient. It saves me space and I like it.
2,The New Ballet Workout VHS Melissa Lowe,"This ballet video is almost impossible to follow. The feet and legs of the dancers are shown fleetingly if at all, the combinations are hard to follow and narrated only one time through (extremely frustrating given that most of the time the viewer is watching the necks and faces of the dancers), if you do not have a background in ballet you will not understand the terminology used nor will you be able to do these exercises in such a way as to get a meaningful workout. I took adult ballet, at professional schools and with excellent teachers, and found this tape aggravating to say the least. The New York City Ballet Workout is a much better tape (even though it can become a little monotonous with repetition) for an ""at home"" workout. Don't waste your money on this one unless you want to spend 45 minutes looking at the hairdos of dancers."
2,Only for 3/4 inch miter slots,"I have a Ryobi Table saw with a smaller miter slot and it won't fit it. I would recommend the TS-Aligner jr. Lite instead. The only thing you will get that you can use is the dial guage, and you will throw away $40."
2,"Great idea, but the plastic base for this gage just ruins it.",Tried the SuperBar in conjunction with the MasterPlate (which is very good BTW) & just couldn't work with the cheap plastic base. Too much slop.Sent it back & got the A-Line It Table Saw Gage instead (not available through Amazon though). Basically the same concept as the SuperBar but all metal. Much better product in my opinion.
3,TS-Aligner Jr is worth it,"I thought about this, but went with spending a few bucks more for the TS-Aligner Jr and am ticled with it. Nothing is cheap plastic and it is beatifully machined. I thought my saw was dead on until I got the TS Aligner. Not only was my stock blade warped, but the fence was .011"" toe in at the outfeed end. Now I am getting a decent blade and the fence is set toe out .001"". It also allowed me to confirm that both arbor shaft and runout were less than .001""."
4,A Goodie Of A Gem,"This is not your typical horror movie, and I can see why the such low rating, but this movie is a solid 4 star because it was well done. This movie was not made as a straight out horror, but instead the idea of having your brain replaced by someone you've always loved your whole life is the horror of it all. This is not horror in a sense of blood and gore but a well crafted story that makes you think what if, that my friend in a sense is scary stuff. So, check it out. For a 1996 film, it was well done and very enjoyable to watch."
4,Great Game for NCAA Fans!...,"A little slow at times, but the College atsmosphere overshadows and issues. EA Sports has glitches as we all know, but once you get passed them and understand why they happen you will be alright. I am looking forward to both NCAA Football 2009 & Madden NFL 2009. See you on the grid iron!"
3,Decent game,"Nowhere near as fun as NCAA 08 for the original Xbox, but still a great game. Fantastic graphics, great music, all the feel of a new-gen football game."
3,Too easy for baby to yank off,"I ordered the small based on other reviews even though my baby is 7 months old. They are about the size of our drool bibs. They catch a lot but they don't have a pocket, unlike the large size, so some food does roll on to his lap. At least the small size is more environmental than the large. On the other hand, I had to order 6 boxes online (couldn't find them locally). I hope I get to use them all up before they are useless. The biggest problem is that my baby yanks them off very easily. I'm hoping he will lose interest in that soon."
5,GREATEST Chess Game I ever bought,"The 4 Way chess game is an awesome ""social"" experience. My friends couldn't believe how much fun it was to play. At first we got the rules wrong - which I admit was even more fun than when we played the ""right"" way. It may intimidate some players, but novices love the idea of having your pieces fly all over the board causing chaos. This game turns bad players into bad and dangerous players!"
1,Too Costly for This Type of Unit,"Similar units are now very inexpensive, but still not worth the price. It seems they are all made the same and have no life-span. I had purchased a Koolatron unit last year, and 3 other brands this year. Each of them lasted less than 1 month, but I thought the next one would be better - not so. The manufacturer needs to do a lot of work to make these little cooler/warmer units something more than throw-away items."
1,KOOLATRON IS BUST!,STOP! Don't waste your money!...I purchased the Koolatron compact fridge and within 90 days the vent would freeze.I was sold with the image of this unit having the ability to run 24/7 but that's not the case.Every week I'm having to unplug the unit to avoid the ventilation from freezing.Good luck calling customer service...they barely speak english. The reason I rated with a 1 star is because I can't rate it a zero!
4,Great Stuff!,This is a quality collection of Baseball favorites including some great little-known tunes. I think it's even better than Baseball's Greatest Hits.
2,Poorly done,"The pro shop is tiny, photo game face is much too complicated to get to work. Hitting the ball well is nearly impossible, and the game lacked creativity in general. Tiger Woods 2005 was way better."
2,Rushed Tigerwood,This game was rushed out by EA. It has many bugs.I am a Tigerwoods golf game since it was first market but now I might have to rethink about that.Don't buy or you will regret
3,Game has bugs!!!! Warning!!!,"You will never be able to finish the Tiger Chalange because two of the events have bugs in them that will cause the loading screen to freeze up.This is such a huge mistake and one that I hope can be corrected at some point or they will really have to think about a refund or recall of some sort.Other then that issue its your same basic Tiger game only slightly better looking. Same feel, same events, same people. EA is really damn lazy.If you liked it before, you'll like it again... but nothing will suprize you. Please, someone else make a rival golf game!!!"
5,Just in Time for Jazz Fest,"It's been four long years since The Iguanas' last studio release; and that one, the self-produced Sugar Town, followed its predecessor by three long years. Clearly this band has grown and evolved in that time. Long time fans won't be disappointed by the band's excursions in new territory. While new listeners will hear something rare in today's music: great songs delivered with deep feeling by the artists who conceived them."
3,ea shut it down,"I purchased this game and enjoyed it, but my intention was to play it online with a friend who also owns it. EA has already shut down the servers for 2008, so can play online. The gave is very fun otherwise."
1,worst ea game ever,"I've been playing ea football games for 15 years and this is by far the worst one i've every played. late hits on qb were sporadic as far as calling 15 yard penalties, balls caught out of bounds were ruled catches, fumbles caused by the ground were considered fumbles...could go on and on. this game is not consistent. way too many int's and fumbles. too bad; ea used to be good."
1,For the Lonely and Broke,"I was suspcious about this book after reading the quide for Sacramento and the Gold County which I know well. The authors seem lazy and penniless. Accommodations are not described well and luxury sites are barely mentioned if at all. Descriptions of San Luis Obispo, Pismo and Monterey were worthless. This was a very disappointing ""Lonely Planet"" book with no research, interest or creativity in the reviews of terrific Calfornia towns."
1,No color illustrations,The main attraction of this book is the beautiful color plates from Andy Weber. However the Kindle edition has only low-resolution dark-contrast grayscale images. The Kindle version is not worth purchasing unless this gross oversight is corrected.
4,Great coffee!,"I have had this product for only a couple days, but I am already very pleased, especially for the price (Friday Sale). Based on the reviews, I did not expect the permanent filter, and there was not one in the box. My local gourmet kitchen store has one that fits for pretty cheap, though, so I'll probably pick one up soon.This machine makes muuuch better coffee than my old cheap machine. The charcoal water filter is a nice touch, and I especially like the choice of warmer plate settings.The only down sides so far are a small scratch on the side (expected with a refurbished model), and a top lid that does not always close all the way (no leaks though)A great value!!!"
1,Buyer Beware,"Purchased the refurbished Cuisinart DCC-1200 12-Cup Brew Central Coffeemaker with high hopes. Have purchased refurbished items in the past with great success. This experience was different. After 60 days the coffee brews but the warmer turns off immediately after the coffee brews. Amazon only stands behind products for 30 days so you are left to calling Cuisinart for remedy. Their idea of customer service for refurbished products is to prove the product is in warrenty by faxing (your cost) the receipt then pay to ship the defective product to and from Cuisinart. When they receive the defective product, they will ship a replacement. Oh yah, the 90 day (not 3 year for new products) warranty does not start over, the warranty continues from the time of purchase. I hope the replacement product works more that 30 days or I am out of luck. DON'T PURCHASE A REFURBISHED PRODUCT FROM AMAZON. THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND IT AND THE MANUFACTURER STANDS BEHIND IT ONLY AT A DISTANCE!"
4,good & bad,"I was pleased to fine this product at the price I paid. However, I was disappointed that the Amazon.com site did not make it clear that no gold tone filter would be included and that the refurbished product did not carry the same warranty as a new machine. Had I known these two facts, I might have purchased a new one."
1,broke down right after warranty expired,this coffee pot worked fine until just after the 90 day warranty expired and now i can't pull the pot out while the coffee is brewing because the coffee continues flowing onto the base and and the coffee overflows the basket.
5,Awesome,"This is one of the best I have played on. The quality is good and it was a great experience when I had friends to play. This is much better than the other tables / table tops we had before. The net post is okay, could have been better but no issues there."
5,Excellent Product,I was very pleased with the overall process of ordering and receiving this conversion table tennis top. The product came well packaged without any damage. The product is professionally made and the table plays just as good as any of the more expensive table tennis products you can buy.
3,Oily goo,"The juicer arrived covered in clear oily goo that defied cleaning with soap and water or even wiping off with paper towel. I got it clean after 30 minutes of serious elbow grease. Once clean , it actually worked quite well."
4,Thank you!,Great service. Received order in timely matter. Very basic juicer but will work well for home use. Really saves my wrists when juicing.
5,Great little juicer!,"The Oster 3186 Juice-n-Serve is a great small appliance!It not only juices, but the top part becomes a pitcher for storing or pouring your juice.It's narrow and not too tall, so is easy to find a place for it in an already filled cabinet.I'd definitely buy it again!"
5,"Plenty of power, works great","I was looking at buying the Jack Lalane juicer, but then I discovered that I would have to PEEL all my oranges, lemons and limes (the peel oils are bitter). Since I only juice citrus fruits, I decided to try this juicer to avoid pain in my wrist when I use a hand juicer. I was surprised by the power of this device, I can press down very hard and it keeps turning. It also gets out EVERY LAST DROP of juice from the fruit, something I could never do by hand. With this juicer I am now getting almost twice the juice I had been getting by hand! I love this juicer, it is easy to use and easy to clean. You can't beat the price either."
4,Juice tastes best,"My Braun juicer broke a tiny plastic part after many years of daily use. Hard to replace its perfect design and results since Braun doesn't make an American version anymore. Tried other comparable and more expensive juicers, but the Oster comes closest. I'm happy with the flavor of the juice and ease of use."
4,Great little juicer!,"This juicer works great! I went through a bag of oranges with no problems. It rotates in one direction, and if you lift the fruit and press it back down it changes the direction of rotation. Once in a while it does do this back-and-forth rotation .. not sure if it's because the pressure I'm placing is confusing or if this is actually an added function to get the last of the juice?I'm removing one star because it is sort of bulkier than it needs to be - the shape of the pitcher makes it a bit ""cuter"" and looks more acceptable and modern sitting on a table but it's a bit top heavy, bulky, and the lid slips off if not put on just right."
3,"Works, but has a strange quirk","The juicer works really well, and operates without the lid on it. You can also take the pitcher off of the juicer, and with the lid it can go straight into the fridge. That's a pretty cool feature.I have only one complaint, but its pretty significant. This juicer doesn't work with our protected electrical plugs. I think it has to do with the fact that any time there is too much resistance, the juicer flips the way it turns, and it's causing our plugs to reset.Because of this, we have to do our juicing in the living room where the plugs are not protected. Pretty annoying.Other than that single gripe, it works well."
2,Died the first day!,We juice two cases of citrus each Passover and have burned out many juicers. We read many many reviews and decided to buy this one. We are really happy with our Oster blender and people seemed to say this was a real work horse. Nope. We burned out the motor on the first day preparing for Passover. We didn't even get 1/4 of the way through the box of juicing oranges. This juicer is probably alright for occasionally juicing a few oranges but it will not stand up to Passover.
3,Nice one but flimsy,"I bought this on 04-10-2010. This is very flimsy as few reviews said. This works great on oranges which are soft and fully ripe. I always get a feeling that it is going to break any minute but not yet. For the price, it is ok."
1,"Oster 3186 Juice-n-Serve 27-Ounce Automatic Citrus Juicer, White (Kitchen)",I bought this juicer about 4 month ago and only used it maybe 5 times then motor died. Stay away from it because it’s cheap quality product.
1,Bad Dye Lot,"I ordered this juicer because a friend of mine had one and I thought it worked nicely for the price. But it arrived yesterday and to my dismay it was so discolored that the color was actually lavender ... all but the spindle. I know my friend's unit is completely white so I decided to exchange it for another one. But for some reason I can't exchange it, I can only return it. ???? I guess I will have to go to one of the megastores and get one I can inspect before I buy it. I am really annoyed at whomever thought they could fester this defect upon an unsuspecting public. Caveat emptor; bad quality control."
4,Great acoustic strings,These are a nice hybrid guage that work well on my guitar. The .055 low E (vs. .053) gives it a better bottom end than light guage strings. They aren't hard on the fingers like mediums are either. 4.5 stars!
3,Not the sound I was looking for.,I tried these on my 2008 Talyor GA4e and the sound was just a bit to bright. The heavier bass strings didn't really add the bassy sound I was hoping for just more of a thud. YMMV.
1,Horrid Quality,"The quality control at this company is astoundingly bad. The guitar strings were extremely brittle. The E and B strings snapped the moment they became snug on the peg (not even tight enough yet to reach their respective tunings)! The packs of 2 strings are all labeled according to their supposed contents. The strings were all mixed up. The pack labeled 3rd G and 6th E actually had a 2nd A instead of the 6th E. Needless to say, the other packs also had incorrectly labeled contents. I haven't used Martin strings in many years and am surprised how badly they make these strings. That's what happens when you send your manufacturing dept. to 3rd world countries and exploit their people in the name of maximizing profit."
4,Good Family Entertainment,I like this film I saw this 27 years ago on the Disney channel...It is a good family movie. With action and adventure with no cussing. If your looking for a fun movie with outdoor wilderness adventure and your kids are into outdoor things this movie is perfect for you!
3,Great scenery,"That's about all I can say about this movie. Story and acting were kinda cheezy that goes along the lines of the 70's back to nature kick and the John Denver rocky mountain high. And again, great scenery !"
5,Lovely,This is a beautiful story. It's now one of my very favorite books. This is a story that will fascinate any reader. I read it in one sitting.
1,Cable is NOT compatible with most monitors and computers,"I ordered this cable before reading the customer reviews. As stated in the other review, this is a DVI-I cable which is NOT compatible with a DVI-D outlet. Since almost all flat pannel monitors and computers use the DVI-D format, this cable will not work with most monitors and computers. A DVI-D cable will, however, work with both DVI-D and DVI-I outlets. So why didn't they make this a DVI-D cable?"
1,Definately not for me.........,"I love Geirach and have every single book he's ever written. I have also read Lyons and Babb's and a host of others. Those authors are humerous but temper their humor with fresh insiteful thought's as well. This on the other hand, was the most diapointing (supposed) fly fishing related work I've ever come across. It is non-stop non-sense front to back. I read the first chapter then skimmed the rest just to see if the author would ever settle down and put together some sort of reasonable cognisant thought somewhere. If he did I never saw it. Just a constant on-slaught of dry repetitive jokes. Not for me......."
5,More complex than most harlequins,"This is my first book by Sara Wood and it won't be my last. I loved all of the relationships, not just between the hero and heorine. Most unsual in a Harlequin was the fact the both leads had charming personalities and actually liked one another as people. And it was pretty hot, too."
5,Very Moving and Motivating,"I did not quite ""get it"" that there were three books in one, but I'm very grateful for it - I got the ""happy ending"" I'm so childish as to want. I'm soo childlike that I didn't want to look at the pictures in the last set to see wedding photos until I could read about the relationship and subsequent wedding. The ""A Step Further"" is fabulous in that it is the only work I've ever read willing to take on the hard questions of sovereignty (too often used as a cop-out in conversation) and of God's love for us, magnificently summed up by her statement of lasting effect - was (can't find it to quote it directly) that miraculous healing of a quad, for instance, would have a limited effect for the Kingdom of God, 40-50 years for the length of a mortal life, but for the salvation of even one, it was worth being bound to the chair. I am handicapped so this was a life-changing book for me."
1,I wish I could rate it zero stars,Not worth the money buy a different book if you are interesting in learning how to build kitchen cabinets. This book is random and appears to be chapters of previously published material.
4,holy crap it works,"I have use this product a few times in different vehicles. Had extra tabs I didnt need or got in the way. They were pretty easy to snap off using lineman plyers. Fit well in the dash after words and looks like a professional put it in. Just follow directions and you shouldn't go wrong. I have use this brand in Mazda, Ford, and Dodge. They have it for all makes and vehicles. Well so far they have for me."
3,"Fits, but a little loose","I installed this in my girlfriend's '03 Mazda Tribute. It fit, but it rattled. I ended up wrapping the stereo in cardboard to take up the gaps around this adapter. Now, it works great, and she says it looks 'professional'."
2,Marginal,"In the Internet world of Michael Lewis most adults are stupid, incompetent and narrow-minded while children are quick to adapt, quick witted and just want to be left alone by the suppressive establishment. Although there are salient points relative to the potential changes in personal and business relationships brought on by the communication capabilities of the Internet, I found the attempts to stereotype the people in the book in order to make a point diminished the very points he is attempting to make. A more objective rendering would have been more informative."
3,Half of a great book,"If you've read anything by Michael Lewis before, you know that he tells a story better than almost anyone. For the first half of this book, he does that--telling his typically enlightening and entertaining tales about teenagers that have rocked the world through the internet. After that, however, the book gets bogged down horribly, as Lewis analyzes the commercial and social implications of TiVo. Page after redundant page of mind-numbing philosophical musings about the evolution of television advertising had me just about falling from my chair. The final chapter was even worse--not just boring but, in my opinion, utterly pointless meanderings about the impact that technology might have on the human race. Buy the book for the first two chapters, which are excellent, but stop after that or you'll regret the time you lost."
2,"Do not purchase, have a snooze instead.","Lewis write great books, but this is not one of them.Liar's Poker was a great read, even read it a second time last Christmas. However, this new one trades on his reputation far more than the content.Let's get to the point - it's boring."
2,You have to know his work,"I was rather disappointed with this book. The first few chapters were rather intresting. However, eventually it became slow and boring. Michael Lewis uses too much details that were uneccessary. His examples toward the end became dull. His use of words were dragging. It seems like the only reason this book was 236 pages was because the publishing company wouldn;t accept anything less. He filled the end with endless details and awful jokes. However, if you are familiar with Lewis' other writtings, this would seem like a more enjoyable."
1,Paintcorn,"Don't buy this. I received it as a gift. The first time I used it, the paint blistered from the bottom and mixed in with the popcorn so it looked like it had been peppered but it was paint! Yuck. I'm either going to get this thing red hot so it blisters all the paint off to make it safe or maybe I'll just throw it away. Even if all else were fine, it only makes a single serving of popcorn making it only useful for hermits."
1,curls up,"As others have mentioned, this mouse pad ""cups"" or curls up. You can't really uncurl it either. This makes it virtually useless, as it doesn't lie flat on the surface of your desk or table. Allsop has to be aware of this problem. Their failure to address this is disgraceful. This product should be taken off the market if they are incapable of improving it to where it does not curl up. Do not buy this product."
4,Love this movie!!,"The story of three students on a cruise in Greece is what first got me into island-hopping in Greece. This movie is a guilty pleasure for me and I've loved it for it's care free and loving humour ever since I first saw it. It showcases Greece and the Cyclades beautifully and is a classic 80's movie IMHO. This is a B-movie but any movie that can make ""moonlight and vodka"" into a standard party song among my friends can't be all bad. I remember seeing it for the first time how the sound of the movie really impressed me. I can't wait to get this on DVD!!"
5,"Practical, sensible program to help those with new hips.","If you have had your hip replaced you must exercise sensibly and under medical supervision to get back to good health. Like me, Jack Kelly, had a new hip. We know what is like to recover from this successful operation. To help others recover quickly Jack devised a simple set of basic exercises that increases flexibility, bone density, and energy and helps you lose weight and control your stress level. The exercises are well illustrated, take 30 minutes on 3 days a week, and will become an essential part of your life after a few weeks when you see the benefits they bring. This special book adds importantly to the experience of hip replacement of the 14 stories told by patients in my own ""All about hip replacement""."
2,"The Da Vinci Book: 97 Quizzes, Games, & Puzzles (Quiz Book)","I expected more puzzles, but the book is filled with questions that relate more as a biography quiz than anything else. A good book for someone who has written a biography but a little boring for anyone who is not into the minutae of DaVinci life. LOTS of date specific questions."
2,blah...,"This glare screen is just too expensive for what it does. I got it because i thought it would help my eyes from getting too strained and for glare reduction, well, the little stickies that help it stay on wore out too fast and i had to figure out a way to keep it on there. Overall i dont advise you buy this, its too expensive for the quality and it helped me none, my eyes still get bothered by the glare and i have tape so it stays put, yeh its a mess, i dont recommend this product."
3,Good show; pretty but shallow book.,"This book, while a fun peek behind the scenes of my favorite show, was devoid of any real decorating content AND poorly edited. I was really hoping for something that focused more on the interior designs featured in the show."
4,"Interesting, but...","Interesting, but not what I thought it would be. It's really a look at the cast, where they're from, how they got started, etc. I'm only a casual viewer, so I wasn't really that engrossed in it. Still, like another reviewer noted, it's interesting and readable.If you're looking for something that'll make you laugh, try reading 'No One's Even Bleeding'."
1,Damaged Cans,"I am very disappointed in the shipment of gooseberries I received yesterday. All of the 8 cans were damaged. They were shrink wrapped damaged and sent. I have no way to return them. I can't even find a way to leave a negative report on the seller, it was obviously their fault. Never agan."
2,damaged,"I was greatly disappointed in my shipment,it was severely damaged. out of 8 cans only four were not crushed on sides and bottoms. Gooseberries are hard to find in the stores here and I was so looking forward to the shipment, More over I reported this to Amazon .com and no response.The Oregon company should know that this shipment was damaged but I am at a loss as to who to report it to. [...]"
1,Keep Looking!,"1. Illustrations-two thumbs down2. Lesson plan/student worksheet conflicts3. Best for use in the American ESL classroomI bought this book to help me teach ESL in China. I found that the illustrations are more like frustrations because they are so terrible and confusing. I think my ESL students could have produced a better looking book.Moreover, this book supplies lesson plans for the teacher and worksheets for the students... However, they are often combined... So if you were to xerox a worksheet for a class, it would have part of your lesson plan ""instructions"" listed on the top of the worksheet right under the student's name and date.The topics I think are only ok if you are teaching students who are living in the states. They describe safety issues and hygiene typical in America, but ""Greek"" to any foreigner."
5,Interesting Read,"Robert Sawyer is one of my favorite authors, and with his newest novel ""Mindscan"" he did not let me down. It is an interesting look at human consciousness and what it means to be human."
1,Liberal Political/Scientific Junker,"MINDSCAN(2005) starts off slow, and then hits a brick wall when the ultra-liberal politics and science takes over.There is supposed to be a story about copying of human awareness to a machine, but the shallow characters and plot are lost in the backdrop of the left-of-AirAmerica Canadian politics, as masses of Americans are ""fleeing"" to Canada, where they can get legal hookers, drugs, suicide doctors, etc., all because of a ""post-Buchanan administration"" America.Americans are also fleeing to Canada to escape GLOBAL WARMING, because in 2048 Toronto's climate is supposed to be balmy in the Winter (this is utter baloney, and not going to happen, folks).When it comes to ultra-left SciFi Politics and Science, Mindscan is like the worst of Ben Bova and Allen Steele combined. Virtually nobody listens to AirAmerica, and virtually nobody should read Robert J. Sawyer... only died-in-the-wool America-Bashers and Global-Warming extremists will really be at home."
5,For anyone who loves the City by the Bay,"If, like me, you are a California- or San Francisco-phile, then doubtless you already know of this book. It is THE classic account of the Gold Rush era, mostly because it isn't tarnished by revisionism--it was published in 1855! It has served as the first informational source for both researchers and novelists alike. But this review is intended for those who might not be familiar with the history of California, or may have read only the novels, journalism, or light non-fiction treatments. Don't be put off by the publication date or the book's level of detail--it is a very enjoyable read! The authors were not scholars or historians, but rather a doctor, a lawyer, and a journalist. It is jam-packed with anecdotes and factoids that will make you appreciate even more the accounts of Mark Twain, Joaquin Miller, Ambrose Bierce, Bret Harte, Henry George, etc. It is truly the root of the fruit."
4,It is just as it appears - great for holding treats at work,"This is exactly what it looks like: the trojan rabbit from the ""MP & the Holy Grail"". Note: it is a scaled down version. It isn't that durable and it isn't really educational unless you use it to explain the Trojan war to your 4th grader and then get corrected on half of what you say since he/she is presently studying it... hypothetically speaking.However, its main value as I see it is as a talking point at work, a way to share treats with office mate to encourage communication, and to reveal the inner geek that still thinks the entire Trojan Bunny from the film to be a work of genius."
1,Caricatures instead of characters,"I picked up this book because I usually enjoy thrillers - especially political and legal. I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews. In my opinion, this is a pale imitation of the Baldacci, Ludlum, Follett, Forsyth etc. I've enjoyed in the past. The few chapters I've read thus far are formulaic (at best) and the characters are so over-the-top that they read like a Saturday Night Live parody. I don't think I'm going to waste my time finishing the book."
4,fast moving spy adventure,this is in a series of books by this writer that is fast moving and has a lot of current technology of fight the terroist world.
1,Beware !,"This is not a prof. production, except for the narration. Fair sharpness only with nervous cam. work. So this ""private -video"" is not price-worthy!"
3,offbeat horse flick,"An orphaned 16-year-old Welsh girl, Gwen (Sian MacLean) again has to deal with the loss that death brings when her grandfather passes away after being thrown in a riding accident. She's left to handle the family farm and all the horses on it until her uncle (Daniel J. Travanti) enters the picture, wanting to sell the property to a greedy land developer. One possible way to keep the farm is for Gwen to enter her beloved black stallion Mabon (named for a Pagan holiday) in the Christmas Costume Race. The climatic scene showing Gwen as an angel riding against Father Christmas and an elf, among others, is certainly one of the more unique racing scenes in the movies - think of it as the Doo-Dah Parade on horseback.Staci Layne Wilson"
2,no instructions,I have never used a stop watch and am pretty good at figuring things out. I cannot figure out how to set this thing up and how to turn it off when I am done with it.
1,Avoid Like the Plague,"There's a reason why, among the Magic: The Gathering storyline forum community, this is referred to as The Book That Shall Not Be Named. Creepy sex scenes, pointless slapstick humor, undeniably bad dialogue, a plot that goes nowhere fast, and a resolution that wouldn't pass amongst non-shared world fantasy novelists. If you want to read a book that will make you want to ingest large quantities of asbestos in an effort to make the pain go away, this is the one for you. A chore."
1,Legion = dissapointment,"After reading Legions(twice because I thought I read it too fast) I was highly dissapointed. The story never really focuses on just one spot for a long time to understand what is going on. King(who wrote the Invasion novels cycle, which was an excellent mix of fighting and story) couldnt really show the conflicts that happened (extremly odd since Legions was expected to have a lot of fighting), and those that were shown were too short or simple.Only buy this book if you plan to have the entire collection. If you are looking for something to enjoy I recommend some of King's earlier work but not this one."
5,Soul Double CD,"Simply put, versatility at it's best! With memorable songs from soul and jazz artists such as Nina Simone, Sylvia Striplin, Linda Clifford, and many others, I strongly recommend it!"
3,RECEIVED CERTIFICATE OF INSURANCE,TO RECEIVE THE CERTIFICATE OF INS. WITH OUT A LOT OF EFFORT ON MY PART. IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT.
1,Impossible to tell,"Without equipment failure and the attempt to exercise this extended warrantee, it's not possible to reasonably comment."
3,Worked well,"Batteries with product wouldn't take a charge, may just be old. Otherwise, worked very well.Thanks!!"
3,Saint's Temptation,A little disappointed with this. Perhaps because the first book I read by this author had a truly GOOD story plot.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"THIS DOLL IS WAY TOO MUCH MONEY FOR WHAT YOU GET. DOLL GREW TOO FAST, DOESN'T DO WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO. MY 6 YEAR OLD OPENED IT ON CHRISTMAS PLAYED WITH IT FOR TEN MINUTES AND HAS NOT PICKED IT UP SINCE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Too many malfunctions,My 4 year old daughter loves this doll when it is working. The doll works occasionally and will talk and grow but too often is shuts down while my daughter is playing with it. It has never responded to her commands and many times after turning it on it says Mommy and than shuts down again. The doll would be wonderful if it worked properly and at all times.
3,She's OK,"My daughter was thrilled to get Baby Suzie for Christmas. She worked well the 1st day. But we had problems for a few days until I called Hasbro and was told that she can't wear her ""big girl"" panties and still function properly. So, she is working OK again, although without undies! The company offered no replacement or alternative for that. Her facial paint is not of a great quality. Her lip color has peeled a little bit, doesn't seem to upset my daughter, but for the price I was disappointed."
1,Save your money!,"This fridge was used only a few times before it completely stopped working. There is no way to repair it through Amazon or Koolatron. If I were looking for a similar product again, I would be sure to look elsewhere."
4,Should do better with the songs and vocal and song abilities.,I love the video and the animation. There is some history about the coins in this dvd which is a plus. The problem is that they could do better with the songs and the singing. There is no rhytm or poetry in the songs. They should hire people with good voices to sing. Music is very important in learning and remembering concepts.
2,stupid pour design,"Sturdy enough, but if you are pouring into anything other than a great big bowl, it spills all over. The teeny spout is useless."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This DVD is just another marketing ploy aimed to rip off parents while disappointing their kids. I bought this DVD for my daughter who is a huge Demi Lovato fan. I expected current footage and much better production quality from such a huge star as Demi Lovato. All you get in this DVD is footage of a very young Demi Lovato dancing in a poorly choreographed, lip-synching, low budget music video. This is a very boring DVD and shows no good examples of how to ""Be Like a Pop Star"". I give a generous one-star rating to this DVD only because my daughter felt young Demi looked very cute. But otherwise, don't bother to add this to your Demi Lovato collection!"
4,review,"Seems a good basic sufficent stand-alone stats book for medical professional (ie non specialised statistician), although admittedly I haven't used many others to compare, covering a comprehensive cross section of the commonly used medical science stats techniques, with excellent basic maths / stats principles that are relatively easy to understand for those with a basic mathematics background (higher secondary school). Possibly too light on for some more complex stat techniques (eg multi-variate analysis - eg no mention of cluster or hierarchial or other specifically indicated analysis etc.) - ie newer edition mayn't have moved sufficiently with the times. Nonetheless a good solid stats background, very readable, and responsible in imploring appropiate use of stats. Very usable reference and / or learning book."
2,Huh..? What...??,"A discombobulated cowboy comedy in which an aging (over-the-hillish) Jimmy Stewart locks horns and then falls in love with an eccentric, headstrong English woman, who is determined to introduce Hereford cattle into Texas. The livestock angle dominates the plot (yawn -- who cares?) and the most likeable character turns out to be her prize bull, Vindicator. I thought this was kind of a snoozer, with a somewhat brittle feel overall. Kind of a dud."
5,Future Classic,"If anyone wants to improve their short game dramatically, get this dvd. You have two premier players in the world teaching you how to execute various short game shots, as they would play it, in a heads up format against each other. Chipping, pitch shots, bunker play, even that awkward 30-50 yard wedge shot is in there. They'll show you how to do it.My score was in the the high 100's before the dvd, and now I average low 90's and high 80's as my average score. Was it worth it? Absolutely, My golf buddies thought I practice like a mad man to lower my score, when in fact, all I did was play it like the pros do."
5,Watercolor Flower Painter's A to Z: An Illustrated Directory of Techniques for Painting 50 Popular Flowers,"An Excellent reference for beginning through advanced painters.Everything needed to paint lovely floral watercolors: Selection of paper and paint colors; step-by-step sequence of demonstrations along with samples of completed ""floral portraits"".If I were to own only one book of floral watercolors, this would be it!"
3,Not bad........,This opener is something you could easily find in a store for about the same price. Nothing spectacular about it.
5,changed my life,"A friend lent me this book and I started using it right away. Some books on alternative healing have a lot of interesting theory and some have hands on information. This book has both from the theory of meridians to the exact ""grips"" one uses during a treatment. I recommend it highly and hope that it become's available soon"
4,Very useful!,"This book was kind-of hard to read, but over all the information in it has been so useful! The book teaches techniques that the author uses in her practice. The art that she uses works wonderful, she has case studies so you can see how reflexology helps different patients, she tells the history as well. Overall a very good book, well written, informative, and fun! I gave it 4 stars because of it being a little difficult to read."
3,Not for the small boat builder,"This book is fairly thorough for the types of boats it covers i.e. Small Yachts both power and sail .There is nothing on small open type bare hull shallow draft boats like a flat bottom or semi-vee fishing boat for which I was interested in .The construction photo's might be of value,but there again they are of the construction of the various small yachts being built from plans sold by the author."
1,It stops working for no reason at all!,"Awful. How it stops working makes no sense to me. It's just a heat sink attached to a fan. But fail it did. Moral of the story: it keeps things during the winter...maybe, but during the summer: forget it."
3,OK,A little dissapointed with this set of clay. It tended to try and break very quickly after opening the package.
2,Design Flaws,I would rate this book in OK to poor category. The design is poor. Not worth for the price.
2,Short on Longevity,"I have used these before, and I reordered them because price and size are a fit. However, I find that the blade dulls too quickly."
2,beginners only,"Easy exercises for the neophyte, but nothing here to challenge or enlighten someone with some exposure to yoga, tai chi or chi gung. If the term ""new age psycho-babble"" is in your vocabulary, you are not the type who would appreciate this book."
4,GREAT ESCAPISM,"I always liked this movie of James Stewart with Audie Murphy as his younger estranged brother. Nice escapist fun. Of course, Dan Duryea steals the movie in his role as outlaw chief."
3,Room to grow still...,"Having given this EP a number of listens I can say that I hold out great hope that Mary will continue to produce new music for us longtime fans to enjoy. However I must also say that her debut material, while featuring that amazing, unmistakable vocal instrument of hers, is not yet in the same league as the melodies and lyrics she sang some years back with October Project. Recognizing that musical Romes are not built in a day I'm more than willing to wait and hope that future releases will show continued improvement, so that the songs reach the level of excellence heard in Mary's singing."
4,Read before buying!!!!!,"This is a great CD but three out of the four songs on it are also on her The Other Side of Time, which is a five star CD by anybody's definition. I'd give this one five stars except that there are only four songs on the whole CD. Get The Other Side of Time instead, you won't be disappointed!"
5,A Shock To The System,"Warning: don't expect this book to be easy on the eyes, it is far from that. This is not for children, weak stomaches, or people with heart conditions. The shock is enough to make your heart race when viewing some of these photos. Yet you find yourself staring, sometimes maybe wondering what the photographer was thinking as he took these shots. The book is well done, but you have to be interested in true crime to, if you will, appreciate this collection of photos. It also helps if you appreciate life, then these photos will really have an effect on you, but it also shows you that society really did not change that much since these photos were taken. NOT a good coffee table book, though."
3,Flash without substance,"This book is part of a series on Canadian holidays. Canada Day, July 1, celebrates the founding of Canada in 1867. A short book, its major feature is the colourful pictures which would attract any children interested in learning more about Canada. The drawback is that the details are somewhat limited. If your child is interested in Canada this book would be ok but overall there are better books available."
3,A Haunted Car,"In this ghost story, strange things begin to happen to a woman after she buys a used car with a spooky history."
3,Not Just for Nails,"There are a hundred little fingernail-sized tattoos in this book from Dover Publishing. Each of ten distinct sets has eight small designs and two slightly larger ones for thumbnails. There are ten little hearts with arrows through them, ten pink roses, ten purple kittens (they're really quite cute), ten jack-o-lanterns, ten yellow smiley faces, ten yellow stars, ten pink and yellow butterflies, ten blue teddy bears, ten clovers, and ten ladybugs. The ladybugs are my personal favorite, but I'm always on the lookout for new fingernail designs, and these fit the bill! The tattoos can be applied to skin as well as fingernails. Be creative!"
5,Simply Great,John Sebastian has never need intricate back-ups or production to satisfy true music lovers. His down-home style is straight forward and honest. I can honestly recommend this CD as an experience in true talent. To ME this is one of his best. I consider myself fortunate that it is available since I've worn out three copies on vinyl.
1,"Every can dented at least once, liquified red bumps","I received the blackberries, loganberries and boysenberries intact so I was very surprised to find that the raspberries seemed to have been beaten and then boiled to mush. Amazon issued a full refund but I feel bad that I don't have raspberries in my pantry and I am too flummoxed to reorder and try my luck again.I am taking pictures and will post images shortly!"
3,unreal,"This is example of what can be reversed, It is the first time I ever saw where the U.S. verison of this surpasses the European release...I cannot believe the songs omitted from Europe----especially ""Diamond Dogs"" leading the list....No Golden Years is a shame!!!and a disgrace to this unmatchable artist...who changed every 5 years!!!so I cannot vote in this one favor since I am aware of the quality of the US edition!!!Corky"
4,In-depth and practical guide to JavaBean development.,"This book manages to provide a practical guide to intermediate to advanced JavaBean development while still offering an in-depth discussion of JavaBean topics, especially the new Glasgow specification. This would be your best choice if you'd not only like to know how to develop JavaBeans components, but also the issues that effect their role in component software development. Neophytes might better be served by a more introductory offer, as this book assumes good knowledge of Java."
1,How incompetent,"Like the other reviewer, I ordered this product and half the items listed on the contents the box are missing. All I received were the Xerdisc itself and the pump.Unfortunately I opened the box after 30 from the date of purchase so I can't even get a refund. What a rip-off."
2,"8"" Weather Barometer","The barometer needle does not move unless you tap the glass a few times. If it were easy enough, I would get a different one."
3,Trying too hard to be fair,"The author tries to be fair by always presenting arguments from all possible angles, even if that means presenting weak arguments. Also, he frequently follows an argument seemingly leading to a certain conclusion, and then stop and appeal to intuition alone as sufficient evidence to conclude to the other side. Although he's supposedly a deontologist, and trying to be neutral, he comes off consequentualist. He does a good job with stipulating definitions and laying out sides of a debate in the beginning of each chapter, but the actual argumentation is not very interesting."
5,Perfect,"Perfect fit for our Honda Odyssey 2000, the color for our interior matches exactly! Great Deal!!!!"
3,Actually GAve Me Nightmare!!LOL,"Anyway!!,this novel is written by Howard the dog.(no really)and he tells of his scary adventure in the woods,with 2 strange fellas and their ugly dog with an attitude problem.Cons..The story one of the dogs was telling was boring and took up too much space."
4,"Indians fan changes mind, thinks O'Neill is okay!","Being an Indians fan I have never been a Yankee or Paul O'Neill fan. This was mainly due to O'Neill's actions of emotion of breaking water coolers or throwing his helmet after he failed on the field. After reading his book ""Me and my Dad"". I still hate the Yankees but I do respect Paul O'Neill. He was a great ballplayer and he loves the game just like his Dad taught him to. This book gives a good capsule of a journey of a little kid and his Father by his side from little league to the majors. One side note, there is a typo in the book about the 1997 Yankees - Indians playoff game. Sandy Alomar hit the home run off Mario Rivera not Robbie Alomar. As an Indian fan I will never forget it!"
1,Chinese Tea Pot Not Designed Well,"Specified tea pot ""made in Japan"" in my search. This is from China. The lid is too small and the spout is not properly aligned. Not designed well at all. Misrepresented what it was."
4,Classroom review,"I recently purchased this game for my classroom to add as a fun review. My students liked it, and I'll definitely use it again next year. As for the delivery, it arrived in exactly the condition stated."
4,Harry Potter Rules!,"The books were fantastic and the games almost as good fun to play with frinds and family and almost better than my favorot games infact as good so next time your b,day comes you no what to ask for!"
2,Wish their were other shows w/ DVDs besides this one,"This is one of our least favorite shows on Disney Jr and ironically already there's a DVD for it. The animation on Doc McBoring is nothing we haven't seen before. Plus it plays like a wannabee Toy Story but without the wit or sincerity of Toy Story. Given a choice between this or TS, put your money toward Toy Story 1, 2 or 3."
2,Expected better.,"The clamp seems to well made except that the shaft is held in place with a C-clip, which gets forced out of place every time the clamp is tightened. So, after you use it a couple of times the clip falls out and the clamp comes apart."
5,"Sadly, unfinished","i saw the world end is one of the most brilliant studies of wagner's ring. unfortunately, deryck cooke died before he finished his survey. still, i saw the world end remains an important work detailing the ring and die walkure in particular."
4,Good value for the money,"This is a great little TV and is also compact enough to make it portable to other areas of the house. We turned it on and started using it straight out of the box. My only complaint is that the clearest picture is when you view the screen head-on. As you move more towards either side, left or right, you increasingly lose the picture quality. Overall, it is still a good value."
1,Low volume,"My folks bought this for their cabin. Nice compact TV with decent picture from an analog antennae. Acceptible sound with broadcast TV. BUT sound while playing a DVD was so low that we had to crowd within 6 feet to hear it at max volume! Tried other DVDs with same result. Returned it and got the 19"" model. Much better sound - not just louder at max volume but also better sounding at low to mid volume. Maybe we just got the occasional defective unit/ maybe not. If you buy this product keep your packaging and receipts."
5,I Love It!!!!,"I am an advanced amateur photographer. A couple of months ago I shot my son's wedding on portrait film, scanned the negs and purchased this printer after much research. With Photoshop and the i950 I was able to produce a full wedding album that is indistinguishable from the work of the best professional labs.I'm now working on my 30 year collection of slides to scan and print and I'm blown away with the versatility of the digital darkroom and the quality images this printer can produce. This is truely an amazing printer.Amazon gave me the best price on the web and delivered before the date promised.My only concern now is the longevity of the paper and ink. If Canon lives up to their 25 year claim half as well as they have done with the printer - I'll be pleased indeed."
3,Doesn't work well on a network,"First of all, I love the quality of the output of the printer BUT....it has problems on a network. I sent the following to their tech support:""Printing across network is horribly slow. Small file takes 1 minute to BEGIN printing. HP printer on same network takes 15 seconds. The bigger the file the longer the time. Waited 45 mins for a very large doc to start printing!!!!! Even trying to access the printer properties from a computer on the network can take as long as a couple minutes. ""They responded with this (direct quote from their tech rep):""Unfortunately, Canon does not support the i950 printer when connected within a network environment because of possible communications issues. The i950 is a bi-directional printer but the bi-directional communications is not guaranteed to function when communicating through network components such as routers and print servers."""
2,"After three years, no good.","I bought this printer about three years ago. It worked great until recently when I started noticing streakes and yellow-tones in the print outs. I have been trying to fix the problems but not been able to. Only when I came to this site and read others' reviews, I realized those are common problems with this printer. I basically have to buy a new printer now. I am not sure if I will buy another Canon."
1,Hate it -- paper feeding nightmares,Do not buy this product. It has been a nightmare for us. Consistent problems with the paper feeding system.
3,Doesn't include a connection cable,I bought this printer based off the reviews here and the magazines reviews that I read this would be a great buy. Upon purchasing this I was amazed that printer didn't included a cable to connect to the computer or any of the hardware that they talk about being able to connect. So I had to go out and purchase my own USB cable just to finish install this piece of hardware to my computer. After that this thing worked like a champ! No major complaints. So if you are seriously intrested in purchasing this you should consider purchasing a USB cable to connect to this to your computer.
5,Great Series,"This book is a great coninuence of Rose's. Daisy's involved in sports school, and now has a boyfriend and a job. Its amazing she got throught it all. But afew minor derails as her path through life continues. Dont read Laurel or Lily before you read this book. I read Daisy, Rose, Lily and Im still waiting on Laurel, Its hard to get these book since they are no longer in publish. My dad owns a book company and hes having trouble, but he found It...Just waiting for It to get in. If you need a book, aepbooks.com will find it for you. Amazing book, Daisy is my favorite. Read this book, and then pass it down to a little sister or a neighbor. They'll love it too."
5,Awsome! Daisy Rules!,"Daisy is my favourite ""Sister"" of the Walkers. She's a real person (technically) and goes through a realistic experience after an injury. Anyone should read this story--and this series."
1,Misleading,"The title would lead you to believe it's a home cookbook for weekend steroids. Turns out to be a collection of patents you could only use if you live outside of N.America where it's legal, and own a corporate laboratory. If you're just curious and have an organic chemistry background it's interesting to flip through briefly."
3,hmmm,"..... not a bad starter deck but lacking power/stratigy and quickness needed for advanced players. if u r planning on using this deck in play, i would pumb it up with some powerfull creatures...."
4,"Very good, but inferior to the studio recordings.","This disc captures two very different lineups of Caravan. The first half of the disc features the ""classic"" lineup of Coughlan, Hastings, Sinclair & Sinclair, and the second half features the GIRLS WHO GROW PLUMP IN THE NIGHT lineup, which replaces Richard Sinclair with John G. Perry and adds viola player Geoffrey Richardson. Not bad at all for ""live in the studio"" stuff, but to really experience these guys start with IN THE LAND OF GREY AND PINK and follow it with IF I COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, and WATERLOO LILY, which is their best (and jazziest, yeah!) album.Evidently, all of the found BBC material has now been officially released. Pity, because I have a wonderful BBC recording of the WATERLOO LILY lineup performing songs from that album which outshines everything on this disc. Maybe one day the BBC will dig up the source tape."
2,Incorrect Song Listing,"I love Lacuna Coil and was excited to find a cd that had the track ""Last Lullaby"". This song is NOT on the cd even though Amazon lists it in the Editorial description. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU WANT THIS SONG!!!"
5,All I Want For Brianmas is a Copy of this Book!,I read a friend's copy and fell in love with this book. It's so funny and Graham was so charming. I wish I had a copy of my own for Brianmas (Christmas for all you non-Pythonites!) Guess I'll put it on my wish list....
2,no good value for money,"This book offers no new insights for real Python fans. Also, it's too expensive for a book that short. A Liar's Autobiography is much better."
3,Medieval Dance Music,"While it is certainly medieval music it is not as lively as I had hoped. But out of all the other music I have found so far, it is one of the better compilations of songs."
4,Not durable? Ha.,"So, I bought this mic awhile ago for use on skype, etc. It's worked amazingly so far, and it's been about a year and a half, and it's still working! Now, some are arguing that the mic isn't durable. My mic is currently held together by tape and still works as if it was fresh out of the box (sound quality wise). The microphone itself is nice, as you can rotate it about 180 degrees, you can also manually mute the microphone, and adjust volume via the little box. Great for 10$."
1,Awful recording quality,"I used this headset to record narrated powerpoint presentations and webinars, and while it picks up my voice well, it also picks up EVERY SINGLE background sound, including any creaks and groans within the headset itself. If the cord its the table it records as a little clatter. If the microphone slips a little, it creaks at top volume. Awful."
5,Great value- long lasting,Needed a second headset so I re-ordered this. I use this every day. Audio and mic are pretty clear. I use it with Skype.
3,Great Microphone But Horrible Headphones.,"I've actually been using this headset for over a year now and have not had one problem with it. I run a video review show on Youtube and it has worked great. The microphone part is really good, the noise cancelling is good and it picks up my voice very easily and the volume of my voice is the perfect volume to where I don't have to edit the volume like so many of my other microphones.The only setback for this headset is the headphones. The sound from the headphones is awful. Everything just sounds more condensed and lower in quality through the headphones. I nearly thought the microphone was the problem but when I plugged in a different set of headphones, the mic recording sounded normal. So I always plug in a set of earphones and never use the headphones part of the headset.So overall, the microphone is really good and is definitely sold at a great price but it would have been perfect if the headphones equaled the quality of the microphone."
2,Reproductive Tendencies,"A swarm of alien life forms sucking on the power, and Kes wants a baby BAD. Ok, that's about it. The two are tied together. But this episode drags. I'd say skip it if you've seen it before. The writing is pretty bad, and the execution is lengthy. The only good thing about this episode is the last 8 minutes. (which isn't that great, just the only thing good about it). I must give this 2.4 stars on the Trek O Meter. Its forgettable. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,Never thought I'd be giving a 2 star,"Originally I was going to comment on how weak of a season ender this was, but after doing research I found out Amazon has these wrong. This episode is already the 6th episode of season 2!--back to the review--I'm sure this seemed like a great idea when it was first pitched, but it does not live up to the Voyager name. The plot is dull, the climax is weak, the progression is PAINFULLY slow, and the conclusion is very unsatisfying. And then to add insult to injury the last scene is Neelix kissing Kes (i think i threw up a bit in my mouth...AGAIN) Skip this episode without a second thought."
3,Space Babies,"This episode is about sex and mating, so you think it would be interesting or at least exciting. Nope. I only enjoyed one part, when Kes started frantically eating flowers (I laughed pretty hard). You can skip this one, nothing real important here except Janeway starts thinking about how the crew might start having children.The main players in this episode: Neelix, Kes, and some space dwelling slugs that try and hump the shipWe all know I'm not a huge fan of Neelix, and I cringe whenever He and Kes have any kind of PDA...will never make sense to me."
2,Why?,"If you like Neelix you will probably like this episode, but if you can't stand him you will hate this episode. Either way it's mediocre at best.Putting aside any bias, objectively this is some of the weakest acting and writing in Voyager. It's an episode that is supposed to elicit heart ache and emotion for victims of a tragic war. It fails to accomplish both of these goals because it's not relate-able and never earns what it trys to evoke with it's sub par script.As for my thoughts....I regret watching all of it. What a waste of time."
3,"Great Idea, but why is it so dang expensive?","I happen to be a buffy fanatic and the DVD's with special features included and 22 episodes only cost 40 something. How come this is 90? and used to 129? I paid 129 for the first FOUR season of buffy. Is paramount high?!And yet.I still want to buy it.And according to other reveiws, the product is shoddy too.It's only worth buying if you are a major trek fan, or you are obsessed with the first 15 episodes."
1,dissapointed,"I was actually dissapointed with the quality of the first shipment, it had missing disks and disks that didnt belong there.On the other hand the poor quality of the firt order was corrected as quickly as could be expected.Jeff w ruiz"
4,"When there's a will, there's a JANEWAY",Kate Mulgrew stars as Captain Kathryn Janeway who leads her crew on an ordinary pursuit & capture mission when they get thrust into the far away Delta Quadrant. Now Janeway must work with the Maquis captors to get the crew home
3,Short season mucho bucks,"I have the same complaint about Voyage most folks have; the first season had some interesting episodes but $100.00 for 16 episodes seems a bit steep. The writing during season one took a dive about midway through the show. I stuck with it through season 5 and intermittantly caught season 6. I hate to say it but unless nothing else was on, I pretty much had given up by the conclusion of the series.The concept isn't bad nor are the actors. It's the execution that's wanting. Trek had fallen into a formula and that formula, despite interesting story arcs, made the series predictable. The best acting in the world and the best optical effects can't save a show suffering from predictability syndrome.Now if they had killed characters off and taken more risks after season three, the series might have held my attention."
3,1st Season the Worst - But a Great Series,"I'm very happy ""Voyager"" is finally coming to DVD. Unlike ""Enterprise"" which started out decently and has amazingly gone downhill continuously (the characters are boring as heck) - ""Voyager"" started out weak and got much better over time. The first season, the crew was mostly wet behind the ears, and Janeway still had a bun, really the show wasn't really worth watching until the third (and definetly the creative fourth) seasons. Ultimately, ""Voyager"" ranks #3 behind DS9 and TNG as the best of the Treks to date, and the last four seasons were some of the best sci-fi television ever made."
2,ST Voyager 1st episode,The audio and video were out of sync. It has a good plot/story. I'ts a good value except for the AV problems.
4,decent episode,"pretty good show, not the best but I've seen worse STNG episodes and I'm a big STNG fan. If you haven't seen it than you'll probably like it."
3,Frustrated Purchaser,"This is more of a complaint than a review, since I have yet to see the whole season DVD set. The first time I bought the package, there was no Disk 5. However, there were two Disk 4s. The package was returned, and I bought another package. This one had a Disk 5, but now there are two Disk 2s and no Disk 3. Even worse, this latest package has scratches and finger prints. I guess I'll be making a return voyage to the store again. Whoever is working to put these DVD packages together better get their act together."
1,Death of the Franchise,"Fans of ""Voyager"" must have spent the years of the Original Series, ""Next Generation,"" and ""Deep Space 9"" living in a cave. ""Voyager""'s consistently miserable writing, mediocre effects, miserable writing, uninteresting/poorly developed characters, and miserable writing ruined the ""Star Trek"" franchise for good. No wonder ""Nemesis"" and ""Enterprise"" fared so poorly!Paramount could give me these DVDs for free and I still wouldn't want them."
4,The Feds get a taste of their own medicine,"The Prime Directive doesn't look so perfect from the other side, in this case the Feds are the primitive culture who so badly needs that sweet sweet technology :D I started watching this series almost a year ago, and gave up after the first 3 episodes...thought it was boring, I didn't like Janeway, and I hated Neelix. Now I'm glad my friend convinced me to give it a second chance...coming off watching DS9 it's refreshing to see Star Trek happen on a starship again!! The crew, Janeway, and the plot is really growing up me!"
3,"Human or hologram, reality or hologram simulation!","The doctor's program comes on in sick bay and no one is there. A ship wide emergency caused the activation and the doctor discovers that all the crew is gone. He reviews the bridge logs and Janeway had called for a crew evacuation due to a pending core breach. All escape pods are gone and the doctor feels that he has been abandoned. As he starts to deactivate himself, Torres forces the sick bay doors open and comes in. She tells the doctor that the sensors are down after the attack of two Kazon Predator class warships that severely damaged the ship.....Is the doctor alive and in a simulation or is he the simulation. This episode for me was just average as it contained to many plot loops and twists. This season goes through waves of a good episode followed by a couple of average ones or less than average. If you like the doctor and a complicated plot then this one is for you.There is a fight scene with a Kazon and Neelix that is just silly."
3,Innocent or guilty of murder!,Harry Kim and Tom Paris are on a mission on the planet Benean to have a key navigation system repaired. Tom is accused of murdering the top scientist/professor who is helping them fix the device. The motive to the crime is that older professor has a beautiful and younger wife that Tom falls for. Tom is sentenced in the Benean's way of punishment and is forced to relive the last moments of his victims life and death over and over.Janeway asks Tuvok to prove Tom's innocence before the conviction penalty destroys his mind and his sanity......This episode is just OK to me as it did not really involve much Sci-Fi. It is more of mystery theatre style of program and while it was good it is not what you are expecting from a good Star Trek episode. I rate this as a three star episode. You should watch it but it was just average for me.
4,To Go Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before !,"If you or a member of you family is a Star Trek Fan, or even if you aren't you would like the beginning of this series. It's nice to see a woman in the Captain's chair, it brings a fresh new outlook to the continuing saga of the Starship Enterprise."
4,Good info - but not to read cover to cover,"If you want to know about a certian wine, this is an excellent resource. I personally couldn't pick up the book and read it from front to back. Definately for me, it is much more of a resource."
2,very disapointed,"i bought this thinking it was going to be really cool, but it was very boring and stupid. it contains 3 puzzles all of which a 5 yr old can do and the games are the most stupid games ever. the one with the spinner only shows the objects on the puzzle move smaller as you look at it. thats the whole thing. your pupil is just going back to its smaller, regular size and it makes the picture look like it's getting smaller. and the one with the magic cards is rediculous. anyone can see that all you have to do is choose the cards that you can see the character you chose through. very disapointing. i wish i could have seen the box before i bought it. then i would have seen just how lame this was."
3,Easy to follow,"Like the rest of the series, the outcome was predictable - but it is an easy read and very entertaining."
4,silent witness,"a little drawn out in places by very readable,so im hopeing book three is as good as the first 2."
5,good read,THIS BOOK KEEPS YOU INTERESTED FROM START TO END:) THE KINDLE PRICE IS WELL WORTH IT.I AM NOW A FAN OF THIS WRITER LOL
3,NOT AS GOOD....,"As the first book in the series.This legal/crime thriller has a likeable heroine and unlikable ""hero.""It took me a while to get interested (40% mark), but then the story picked up."
5,excellent,All of Rebeccas books are a must read. I cant put them down once I start them!!! They have just enough twists and turns to keep you engaged without being too much.
3,robuster,"This book was average at best. Josie is put to the test in defending her boyfriend,Archer,he has been arrested on a murder charge.The death of his step-son from a few years ago has come back to haunt him. I find that Archer is not to my liking.He is selfish, moody and childish. I did not like him in the first installment and like him less in this one.This is not why I found this book to be average,it was the constant ramping up of the drama.Instead of letting the story flow, Mrs Forster revs up the drama at every turn never giving the reader time to process the information that has just been delivered.I think the story has a good hook and for the most part enjoyed it.Please, please, find Josie a better love interest."
5,Great story!,Can't wait to read Rebecca Forster`s next book. I am loving this series of Josie Bates books. Real page turner!
5,What a combination.....,"This Georgette Heyer combines wonderful word pictures of life ""following the drum"" as well as a great romance. The fact that these were real characters from history adds a certain spice."
3,Spanish bored.,Wonderful story but a bit long and pedantic. Reads more like a military history than a novel. Heart warming story line but very shallow rendition. This is not one of Miss Heyers best. Spent my time jumping over long pieces of script that seem to have been taken verbatum from Harry Smith's memoirs.
2,Save your money,I've tried twice to read this book. To me it is labored and the characters are uninteresting to me. I re-read the others infinitely but this one I can't make myself finish.
2,Images very difficult to see,"I am sorry to say that I had to return this book--though I was really looking forward to getting it. Though the lessons look like they have had a lot of thought put into them,(the author did well) it is fairly text heavy and I'll admit I prefer a layout with more images to a wall of text. Also, in my opinion, the printing quality is poor. I could not make out some of the images in the book I received -- because most were dark and smudgy! For a book about the visual arts, this is most unfortunate. At the very least, a new print run lightening up the images (see page 142, for example) would improve it."
3,"While CD 1 is dissapointing, CD 2 is very good!","While I agree with an earlier review as to the poor sound quality, less than stellar performance, and skimpy timing (only 35 minutes) on CD 1 (a 1973 BBC show), it should be noted that CD 2, (from a 1978, ""Missing Piece"" era, BBC show) has quite good sound quality, an energetic, tight performance, and is nice and long (about 60 minutes).Even though most fans considered the band past their prime by 1978, this is a worthwhile addition to your Gentle Giant live collection and offers the opportunity to hear some of the (perhaps underrated) ""Missing Piece"" material played live alongside earlier classics.So, 4 stars for CD2, 2 for CD1 = 3 stars overall."
1,DON'T BUY! Deceptive Description!,"I bought this thinking I was getting a great deal on 4 pounds of clay as stated in the description ""Shipping Weight: 4 pounds""Instead I got a tiny box of clay, weighing a total 5.9 ounces!! Description read as if there was 5.9 oz of each color! I can't believe it. First time in YEARS I have been disappointed with an Amazon purchase."
5,Good Job!,"Finally, a book from the three primary investigators and pioneers of digital mixed-media printmaking! The range of techniques explained is breathtaking, the illustrated steps clear, and the imagery dazzling. A truly inspirational book!"
5,Better than the Movie - godhead is highlight,The first song on the soundtrack by godhead is by far the best song on the CD!
4,It's Alright.,"This CD is alright. There are some good artists that appear on this CD, such as Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, P.O.D., Nickelback, and others. The main reason I got this CD, was because Marilyn Manson was re-doing 'Suicide is Painless'(the M.A.S.H. theme), so I thought it would be interesting. The song is pretty good, it's slow, but it's good. Other than than that the other songs range from good to to okay. Such as Rob Zombies 'Dragula'(not a Remix), which is one of my favorites, except for the fact that I already have it on like three other CD's. Then there is System of a Down's 'Mind' and P.O.D.'s 'Lie Down' which already appear on there CD's. Overall though if you don't already own the other CD's with these songs on it than it's good, and even if you do it still has some new songs on it that are pretty good."
2,Typical movie soundtrak album,"Typical movie cd soundtrak formula:include every bloody song EXCept the best ones, first and last, ""disposable teens"" and ""Haunted""this is why these albums end up on amazon starting at 0.21c."
2,Scary Combination,"I was surprised by the combination of Artists on the CD, and their type of music. POD and Project86 are both Hard Hitting Christian bands while Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson are...well...the opposite. It was weird hearing ""upbeat"" (if I can call it that) songs like Lie Down, and then listening to Manson. I was slightly shocked at the way the bands went together. Altogether, the album went along with the movie fairly well. You had the goth/satanic music that went well with the theme, and then you had this Christian music that....well...didn't. I liked Lie Down, and the Project Song, but, I don't particularly enjoy the lyrics for the Manson and Zombie song."
1,$97?!,"I have been buying these for yrs, I have never seen them for $97!!! most I have paid was just over $20"
2,I'll pass.,"I received this machine as a gift a few years back and often just want to throw it out of the window. Occassionally, the zig-zag and straight stitch will work, but the other stitches are not worth the frustration. Singer says they have non-stop complaints about this machine, which according to them, they no longer make. I've spent countless ours adjusting the tensiona nd re-adjusting the tension only to give up. I've spent more time than anyone should on the phone with Singer or writing back and forth to them. I've cleaned it, maintained it and even had it serviced by an authorized Singer dealer. They agree it is a piece of work. There are superior machines in the same price range by other manufaturers. Singer is no longer the company it used to be. However, I will say my old-as-mud Singer 237, made in Italy in the 1960's, rocks to no end and puts this Singer 2662 to shame."
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"I don't recommend this unless you are sure you know how to work the system. From my experience they will get around the replacement plan if possible! Don't call them until you are sure the manufacturers warranty has completely expired or it will be a ""pre-existing condition"" Big mistake for me to believe the advertisement!"
3,Hilarious Trifle,"First the bad. You are paying for a 47 minute operetta. It sounds and looks like a movie production from the 1940s, even though it appears to have been made in the 80s or 90s. The good is that I laughed throughout, the performers are good and the music is excellent Chabrier who I rank higher than Offenbach and Arthur Sullivan. I wish we would also get GWENDOLINE and LE ROI MALGR? LUI on DVD.Remember the old stories about what happens on a wedding night when neither the bride nor groom has been instructed about the birds and the bees? This is a cutesy French version. The best number, for me, was the patter duet between Abb? Pausanias and his pupil Gontran which rivals anything that Gilbert and Sullivan cooked up,P: You translated at sightLucan, Virgil, Ovid, Horace.Juvenal who isn't very clear.Valerius, Flaccus and Stafus.G: There's no denying it, Pausanias,But... It's not enough!Apparently the version given here is a revision by Darius Milhaud. Gontran was originally a pants role."
5,One of the Greatest Artists of the World,"Nara is one of my favorite artists. More than just a Japanese artist, he is actually an international artist with respect from the upper artistic class and the rebel class. He has the ability to become the Asian 21st Andy Warhol, but he appears to not want it. This collection does not do justice to his work. I mean, there is a difference from seeing his work in person and seeing it in a book. Once you have seen his work up close, you feel a haunting sense come over you. This book cannot do that because it feels so impersonal. However, the pictures here are excellent (of course), but I advise anyone to see his work in person. If you cannot, this book will have to do."
2,Works sort of,"This can opener opens the can and isn't so difficult to use that I can't use it, but it always rips up the can label and ruffles the edge of the can lid, leaving it really sharp and jaggy. It also just sounds anemic, like it's really struggling to open the can. I wouldn't mark it down for that by itself, but it doesn't inspire confidence."
4,quiet,"this can opener looks nice on the counter. It grabs the cans easily, but I have to peel the paper off the cans around the top of the can as the can opener gears grab the paper and jams."
4,No complaints,"This is a nice can opener, quiet and easy use, I use a coffee that does'nt have a flip top to open, this opens very nicly if U lightly hold botom of can, opens other cans easily,it is by far the best I have used through many openers"
1,Can opener,"This was not a good purchase. The can opener is hard to use, especially when using a tall can. It is very awkward to operate. It is difficult to hold the can up to the machine, press the top to start it working. I wish there would have been a way to review the operation before I ordered it. Some kind of guide to hold it inplace before pressing the top for starting the opener would have been helpfulWould not reccommend the purchase of this item anyone!!!!"
4,great,"great for the price, but like others said it does tear paper on the side, but not big deal because not like you really going to keep the can, way better than using the one by hand"
3,Oster Can Opener,"I picked this particular can opener because it had good reviews. It works fine, no better or worse than any other I've had. I does shred the paper at the top of the can which I don't like. I'd return it if I hadn't already had to pay too much to get it shipped (since Amazon wouldn't let me cancel within one hour of placing my order.)"
4,Very Good For The Price,I researched can openers not just here but many sites. The reviews on this model were always good and the price was inexpensive compared to many well rated pricier models.I had to try a few times before I could get it to work but once it starts it really works great. The edges are very jagged (this is why I rated it a 4) so be careful.I have had trouble with my hands and will be getting a carpel tunnel test on both. Whether it is carpel or not something is going on that is serious enough to finally compel me to get an electric opener. I hurt my hand pulling it out of the box but operating it was fine.
1,Middletown,Horrible movie. I bought it because I love Matthew Macfayden but I found it to be dissappointing and boring. It was offensive in some parts. The story was really weak. Gave the movie away.
1,FIRE HAZARD -zero stars,"Mine worked okay (one element slow to warmup)for several months. Now the unit won't shut down and I detect a faint smell of burning wires from switch area.If you don't unplug the thing, you're flirting with disaster. Contacted Cuisineart about issue. We'll see if anything happens."
5,So beautiful....,"The Toaster Oven is so beautiful,it has a very good size... it came in a perfect box. The shipping was quick. Love it...Thanks"
1,Fire Hazard,I loved my toaster oven until it started sparking at the switches! I would a zap when switching between toast and oven and there would be smoke. I can still toast with it but the oven feature no longer works. very disappointing!
2,I used to like it,"We got this when we got married 3 years ago and it just stopped working the other day. Like clockwork - the three year warranty runs out and so does the toaster.When it worked it worked well, but it's too expensive to have to replace every 3 years. We will not buy Cuisinart again."
2,a new complaint,"I bought this about a year and a half ago. Finally thought I had found a well-made oven. It works well except recently the toaster tends to turn off prematurely. I just noticed yesterday that the paint on the back of the interior has blistered and is flaking off. Nice, I thought. I wonder how long I've been toasting paint with our food. I did e-mail Cuisinart and received a call back (which I was not home for). Not sure if I want a replacement if they offer one. I'm starting to feel that finding a good, well-made toaster oven is not a reality anymore. Everything seems so marginally made, even if you spend a significant price.April 13. Called Cuisinart and they offered a replacement. Now I have to ship the old one back. I accepted the offer for a new one as I don't see anything new on the market to purchase other than the Breville, which is larger than I want or need (and pricey for what I would use it for)."
5,Worth every cent,"I just won this item from a very competitive auction on Ebay-and let me tell you-it is WORTH it to get it from one of the z-shop sellers -even if it is a little more expensive. If you are the type who likes Cranberries or Sixpence NTR- you will love the first 5 tracks. If you like PJ Harvey-you will like her more jazzy rock riffs in the remaining tracks. There is even a little Spanish flamenco-fun in 'Anna Maria'- all these tunes are sensitive, uplifting and exhilarating. You won't regret getting this CD-and it will never leave your CD player."
4,"Lovely, simply lovely....","Jasmine Rodgers, along with her brother Steve, have two enchanting voices, and when backed by such a great band it makes for a great listening experience. I personally do not think that Duvet shows the full potential of Boa. Personally, I would say that Scoring is a much better song. One Day is quite nice as well, I can't believe that so many people will never get to hear such a great band. I can imagine that they put on quite a show, I've never seen them. But, given the chance I would gladly sell my liver, or something similiar. So if you're thinking about buying this album, don't base your decision on Duvet. You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't."
2,Lacks Substance,"This is a very disappoining book. It comes across as if Torie Clarke dictated the whole thing in one go with no planning or preparation. There is no in-depth analysis of the subject, the whole book is very self-congratulatory and the writing style is casual and loose. On the plus side, it is a quick read and has some common sense observations on communications and public relations."
1,What the world needs LESS of,"So much for the Straight Talk Express. It's all spin and all explained in this book. How telling that McCain's own advisor wrote a book with this name, and then he had the audacity to acuse Obama of using it against Gov. Palin. Sounds like he read this book pretty well. But America needs unity, not more smear, not more blurring of the truth, not winning at all cost."
1,Not made well,"The boots are made without ""Eyes"" for shoelaces, only a very small leather loop with a small piece of triangular wire to put the shoelaces through. The first time I put them on, and then tried to tie them, some of the leather loops broke. I don't see why they were made this way, obviously not made to last.I would like to add that in NO way am I blaming the company from which they came. It is not their fault, is the manufacturers fault.Bargain Outfitters has been very quick to rectify the situation, and are very good at keeping contact.. No complaints with them."
5,This was great,My Mom wanted this. I couldn't find it anywhere; even here it took almost 6 months before it showed up. She wass tickled to death to get it!
1,movie watcher,Extremely dissapointetd. I was under the impression that this movie was on dvd. It is on vhs and I do not own a vhs player. I never read anything that said this was on vhs. Now I am stuck with a movie that I can not watch. Learned a lesson this time.
3,Read the book,"The book is a classic. A wonderful story. ... However, in regard to the movie, outside of the same locale and characters, any similarity is purely coincidental. ... Read the book."
2,Well??,"Well, this game was OK to play once, but after that it was just like reading a book over and over. A book that you liked but wasn't exactly the best book ever. On the box it said for two to fourteen players but it would be difficult to play with so many people crowded around the board and any other number of players other than two or fourteen would be odd. My [younger] brother loves Harry Potter and one of his favorite things about it is quidditch, but even he thaught that it was OK once but wasn't worth playing over and over."
5,Fun Action Game,This game has an actual Quidditch field where you can shoot balls through hoops and actually plays like the game displayed in the book. Finally a company that will just not throw a license on any old game.Sam Atkins
1,um...isn't this already copyrighted?,"ok, i dont have this doll, but i must say that it bears a STRIKING resemblance to Pee Wee Herman!! AH!! just a thought..."
4,Slappy the Ventriloquist Doll,"My daughter wanted this beginner's ventriloquist doll to practice her skills with and was excited beyond words to receive it in the mail. She hasn't put it down for a minute! It's a fun doll for her to interact with. The only draw back is that the body is very flimsy so it makes it difficult to manipulate the string that controls the movement of the mouth while trying to keep the body straight. For someone who is serious about learning to manipulate the actions of a ventriloquist doll, this might not be an ideal choice. If you're looking for a fun doll to cuddle and play with, he's a winner!"
1,"Great idea, but doesn't stick to ceramic sink or hold larger brush","I thought this was a great idea, but it doesn't stick well to my sink, which is not stainless steel. Also, the clip part is tough to fit around my brush, which is just standard (non-Oxo) brush I picked up at local Target. I'm using it, but must re-stick it each time I use the brush and my kids have trouble getting the brush to go back in the holder. I would not be surprised if this works much better on stainless steel sinks, with the Oxo brand of brush."
3,Thought-provoking and very entertaining,"""Time Storms"" is a brisk, thought-provoking, and thoroughly arresting re-examination of the UFO enigma. Randles argues that some atmospheric anomalies, thought by many to represent alien visitors, are in truth natural phenomena that displace space and time. Randles rounds out her thesis with chapters on synchronicity, theoretical physics, and abundant casefiles. Randles' book is a model assessment of contemporary forteana that raises fascinating questions. Also recommended: ""Visitors from Time"" by Marc Davenport, ""The Holographic Universe"" by Michael Talbot, and ""Electric UFOs"" by Albert Budden."
5,Outstanding,The book was in Outstanding condition. It was hard to tell if the book was actually read by anyone. Thank you!
5,EXCELLENT!,"This is possibly the best snowboarding. Nay,best Game Period EVER to come out for any platform. The addicting, ADD style of racing mixed with the need to do tricks is one of the most brilliant concepts that could ever be explored.If you almost buy this and back out then you are seriously missing out. It is fantastic. See also SSX 3.It also is funny because Rahzel is perhaps the dumbest DJ ever. And he does all of the narration for the game. RIKKI RIKKI RAHZEL! BRRRNH BRRRRNH....Buy this. Now."
4,"Awesome game, But I prefer AMPED !!!!","Don't get me wrong this game is incredible, very easy to preform tricks, But I prefer the difficulty of Amped more!! Amped you have to basically learned how to preform perfeclty and there would be no button mashing. In Tricky you can get away with bad landings and impossible tricks. I can play both for hours but becareful trying to switch between the two.. ... I think that the Graphics are a little weak compared to AMPED but are still awesome!!"
2,dont know yet,i just bought this game and the back of the box says two players I have never bought a game that does not atleast offer the option to play by your self is ssx tricky just for two people if it is I will leave it sealed and sale it online because i have no one to play videogames with and the game would be whorthless.
5,Greatest Snowboard game ever But watch out - Not Backward Compatible with Xbox 360,I couldn't wait to get this game now that I have an Xbox 360. I loved it on my PS2 and wanted it for my 360. Doesn't work on the 360 though. Think if I ask MS they'll make it Backward Compatible?
5,Interesting.,I bought this book after taking it out from my local library and decided I wanted it in my library. It gives you great tips on acting and what to do when you're still at the beginning.
4,Cutting a Deal for the Better,"In this newest book installment of a ""Franklin"" story never shown on television in the United States, Franklin finds himself wanting a ""Super Duper Spy Kit,"" but short about half the cash he needs. In his quest to get it, he learns about hard work and also manages to pull off a classic trick in the process. (I won't spoil it, but I will say this: take a lot at the contents of the cover of the book and see if you can figure it out.) Franklin shows generosity too, a good lesson for anyone."
1,Don't Be Tricked Into Buying This Graphic Novel,After reading Box Office Poison I thought I'd like more by the same author. This one doesn't compare and the story seemed filled with boring characters and pointless drama. I wouldn't risk wasting a few hours on this graphic novel.
2,"The Kids Are Just OK, But The Completists Understand","The sheer fact that these are genuine live Who tracks from the '60s & '70s means that lots of folks will need this CD. If you gotta, you gotta. But I think that six months from now, you will find this in abundance at your local used CD store, just like all those Beatles leftovers repackaged into ""anthologies."" And yes, I'm a big fan of these guys.The BBC Sessions are mediocre in sound quality, and for the most part the versions do not improve on the already available (& better recorded) versions. Maybe ""Shakin All Over"" & ""Relay"" are different enough (in a good way) to justify this to obsessives, but even those are close calls.You really don't need this, but do what you gotta do."
4,perfect,fit like a champ. and seems to work better than stock. This filter requires to be Oiled prior to install and does not come with it.
5,Grossman is Great,"After having Grossman's DVD for about 3 weeks, I have to say it is very well done. I like his teaching style and the bonus material included is great.If you're used to standard style tabbing, his tabs may throw you a bit, but you can get used to it pretty quickly. The lessons are definitely not for beginners, and, at least for me will require a lot of practice to play well.The only negative I can think of is the tab booklet is rather small, so you have to stop quite a bit to get to the next page. It would be a lot easier if you could download a PDF file and print out the tab. Other than that I know this will keep me busy for most of the year - I have only gotten through two songs and still have a ways to go to get them polished."
1,Ouch.,"Not to be blunt, or brutal, or unfair, but rather to be succint: this record sucks. It's filled by music of third-rate wannabes and does not live up to the standard of quality set by other Matrix media. I threw it away."
1,This is Not an XML book,"I'm a programmer and sometime-architect. I was looking for a book that identified (1) Why XML is useful and (2) How to use it. This book is over 500 pages long; about 20 pages of it have XML on them. If you're a practical person looking to get up to speed quickly, look elsewhere."
2,a very weak effort by Joseph Hansen,"Okay, I admit I am a fan of Joseph Hansen's Dave Brandstetter mystery series. The author does a great job in projecting a gritty feel to L.A., and I'm normally quite entertained with the mysteries our insurance investigator hero (Brandstetter) is asked to solve. However I found 'Obedience' to be very disappointing. The wharf-side shenanigans involving Vietnamese thugs were very confusing. The author threw in too many characters to keep track of, and there was too much dialog and too little action. This is by far the worst Hansen novel I've read.Bottom line: not worth the time for even the most devote Joseph Hansen fan. Not recommended."
3,Good refrigerator BUT !!!!!!!!!,Everybody was right. The refrigerator works very well but you have to be lucky.My refrigerator came with the top ripped wide open and no insulation at all to protect the product.There were a couple of minor scratches and dents but where I put it you can not see the damage.As I said you have to be lucky. The refrig. works very well IF IT COMES TO YOU IN ONE PIECE AND WORKABLE!!!!
2,Doesn't flow well,"I expected more from this book since it's from Baby Einstein, but the language in the book doesn't flow well. I like the thick, puffy pages that I can use to help teach my 3-month-old how to turn the pages, but the story isn't well-written. I also thought it was funny that the back of the book tells parents to imitate the sounds of the animals that the tadpole meets in the pond, yet the animals in the book are minnows, salamander, beaver and heron. I wish I knew what sound a salamander makes so that I could imitate it for my baby!"
5,Bath Books,My son loves to listen to me read to him while he is in the bath(also likes to chew on it)
1,SHARP EDGES!!,"This is a cute book, but it's useless. I won't let my 7 month old use it because I'm afraid the sharp edges of the book will cut his mouth (or hands, or legs)."
2,Lowell's Own Style,"I like Christopher Lowell's show in general. He has a very destinctive style, and that is what is very apparent in this book. If you love his style you will love his book. But, if you are looking for a book that will help you define your personal style, and help you to create a home that reflects ""you"" don't buy this book. Try, Lynn Peterson's Real Life Decorating, or Decorating for Dummies, or Eclectic Living by Bari Lynn."
2,"Pictures were nice, but pretty over powering.","It seemed like everything in the book was just as over the top as he is. Instead of showing you a really tastefull way of going about decorating something, everything was just bigger, and more colorful, and fluffier. I think that is kind of his style, and I guess I'm just not a fan of it.I think if you really enjoy him, you will like this book. I guess I don't enjoy him or this book."
1,Not worth the money,"This book isn't worth the money. I like Christopher's show (on those rare occasions when I'm home during the day and get to watch it), but I watch it because he's theatrical, weird, sort of fun, definitely NOT doing real design for real people. The book purports to offer real design guidance but it's just a tarted-up bunch of ideas and projects that are stretched and stretched and stretched to fill this book. Not worth the money. p.s. Very funny review by someone else who refers to Lowell as a man's man. Hahahahahahaha."
1,Not much in this book,"I like Christopher Lowell's show and his fun approach to decorating. This book was disappointing, though, because there isn't much in it. Christopher takes the same room or project and stretches it out over too many pages. I just didn't feel that I got my money's worth from the book because of the limited number of rooms and ideas shown."
2,OK but not great,"If you can only buy one decorating book, definitely do NOT buy this one. It's ok but not great. It is not comprehensive. It doesn't have a lot to say. It stretches out projects to take up space. It's worth maybe 1/4 of what it sells for. There are many, many better decorating books on the market.. If you like Christopher Lowell's show (I do), then watch it as the entertainment it is intended to be but don't expect a good design book to come out of it."
2,Need more layers,"What I liked about this book was that Lowell broke the decorating muddle down into seven simple layers. What I didn't like was that the layers needed to be more in-depth and more examples needed to be given, rather than use just one room to illustrate his decorating lessons. For example, in layer two discussing the placement of furniture, he did explain his placement for that particular room, but not for placement of furniture in other rooms with different configurations. It would have helped to have several examples of placement of furniture, taking into consideration traffic patterns, conversation areas, etc. So, although the pictures were beautiful, I felt that there should have been a greater variety of examples of how each of the principles applied in different types of rooms/homes."
5,Best modern poodle book with excellent coat-care chapter,"This was an excellent all-around poodle book. I have several, but this is probably my favourite. I have a black standard and although he is not a show dog, the chapters on coat care, how it grows, grooming, etc. were very in-depth. Though I think that it was geared primarily to people in the show circle, pet owners of poodles should not be put-off. I also have Eileen Geeson's book on the standard poodle and Bruce Fogle's Dog breed handbook on the poodle, both also valuable resources. The only thing I found a bit lacking in Del Dahl's (and Eileen Geeson's) books was there was not enough information on temperment and personality."
4,I got what I wanted!,"I was recommended this book about poodles and found it on Amazon.com. Without any difficulties it was soon in my hand, sent from the US to Sweden. Thank you!"
4,TIMESHARE,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. EVERYTHING KEEPS COMING BACK ""NO LONGER AVAILABLE"" I LOOK FOR IT ON TV. USUALLY CATCH IT ABOUT ONCE A YEAR. LOVE THIS MOVIE. PLEASE MAKE IT AVAILABLE ON DVD !!!!!!"
4,Good Job,"This product is very solid. It pumps me up to lift, but the lemon lime flavor is alright. It tastes like All Sport."
3,Wrong Flavor,"Let me start by saying I have been enjoying this product immensely over the past few months, so this is more an annoyance then anything else. Been trying to rotate through the flavors and I ordered Blue Raspberry on two separate occasions to have them send me lemon lime in its place. I double checked the order link and it even calls it Blue Raspberry yet its lemon lime I'm drinking. Not sure who is to blame here but a bit annoyed."
4,Disturbed,"How much I realize I didn't know about the Atomic Bomb testing after WWII. I am very disturbed at the ignorance and irresponsibility of the US military to endanger lives and our environment for posterity to inherit. I understand the race for nuclear superiority for political reasons, but what this government has done over the past is scary. Almost wish I hadn't watched it. Very disturbing for me."
3,Could not get threw the hole movie,"I am a long time SG1 fan seen them all including Atlantis which in my opinion was the best, but I could not get threw this movie started out boring and steadily got worse."
1,No range at all,"This product was useless. It barely transmitted to 2 adjacent rooms. Limited number of frequency options. If you go past 30 days, you cannot return it - make sure you try it out right away. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,Practical but overpriced for what it is and does,It is NOT whole house and not worth the price you end up paying for it. They sucker you in with a promotion and then turn around and declare the value higher than what you actually paid so tgat you end up paying what you saved in duties and customs!Get ready to fight with it to get an interference free signal. I have yet to get anything but a static filled signal from it!
1,Whole House Junk,"Sound quality = to am radio, Wire antenna difficult to use and won't last, Limited fm band. Do not buy!!!!"
5,True (but good) story,"This is such a good non-fiction book. It has the excitement of a fiction book, but the facts of a real book. Peter Nelson does such a good job telling the story of the USS Indianapolis. This is a very good book to not only use for research purposes, but to read for the enjoyment of it."
3,A little bit of heaven,"Cute and touching story - good acting on the part of both main characters. Gael Garcia Bernal was very well chosen for his role, his acting was quite convincing."
3,A Movie To Watch,I enjoyed this movie. I have known individuals in my life that have conducted themselves in similar manner. This movie was not my typical fare. I gave it a three because I didn't fall asleep during the movie or turn it off. I have been known to do both at times. I have also been known to just shut them down.
4,I cried like a baby,"I love Kate Hudson, I was in the mood to cry (maybe women may understand this) and this movie was the perfect movie for me. If you're not in a ""lay low kinda mood"" - this may bring you down, but it was so sweet. I myself don't know how true to reality this was (dealing with cancer at a young age) but the message of the story was solid and again, I was balling by the end of the movie."
1,Life changing event? This is definitely not a comedy,"From the quick summary, I expected a romantic comedy with Kate Hudson - not a movie dealing with cancer. If the description had been a bit more forthcoming, maybe I would have rated the movie higher. My wife was extremely disappointed since she wasn't expecting a melodrama."
3,"Nice bag, but not my favorite of the Harveys line","This is a decent bag. Like all Harveys bags it is exquisitely made of very durable materials. The lining is sturdy, as well. I do like the bags with wider openings better, like the large and executive totes. This bag's opening isn't very wide and things tend to get lost in the depths. The python print isn't terribly realistic but it's kind of cool.The colors are very nice, a warm brown. The hardware is well-made and a nice bronze color -- the carriage line's hardware is pretty cool. I also like the longer shoulder strap. I like this bag but would go for a wider one in the future."
3,Nice Handbag,This handbag is nice but it is really heavy and pretty stiff. There isn't a whole lot of room for your stuff either. I like it but I don't carry it very often. Don't know if I would buy another one. This bag is definitely not one for shopping.
1,"Very poor, tacked together cash-in game","I am so disappointed with this Garfield game for many reasons. Let me begin by saying that the graphics are great and the music is very sweet. I have to say that my judgment is not all negative, but the gameplay is the worst in the history of all video-games ever. You think I'm exaggerating?Basically, all you have to do is run around a generic level collecting things and occasionally discovering a secret room. Even something as novice as this could have been fun if the controls were not totally useless. It's a very difficult game to navigate through especially since the physics of touching baddies and dangerous objects just doesn't seem right.I finally just abandoned the game since there was obviously no point in taking it all the way to the end. I just wasn't enjoying it and I regret buying it. At least is was cheap.Graphics B+ Sound B Gameplay F Lasting Appeal F"
1,A sad day,"I feel sad for those people who actually think this book contains factual information. Behe and Dempski, both ID advocates were thoroughly trounced years ago.If anyone is thinking about reading this book-please don't, you'll only be wasting your time and money on pseudoscientific garbage. I mean, you wouldn't read a book about a flat earth-would you?If you doubt this post, do yourself a favor and see how many scientifically peer-reviewed journals there are out there that endorse Intelligent Design.You'll realize there aren't any and you'll have to come to one of two conclusions:A. That's because ID is firmly in the realm of pseudoscience and belongs there with it's cohorts (Holocaust denial, geocentricism, aliens abducting people, fairies, etc).B. There's a massive, impossible, conspiracy out there to supress these journals.If you subscribe to option B., you'll probably also think that mankind never visited the moon, that JFK was killed by sasquatch, and God knows what else."
1,Wishfully blind,"Why should blind people write about a theory they cannot grasp? Instead of making elephants out of mosquitos and mixing open minded science with withful thinking the author should better spend some time to carefully read some recent publications. If he requires a better overview on the topic, Campbell's Biology 5e has a very comprehensive introduction. That would do him and so many others more benefit than getting excited about their failure to tell science from fiction."
4,bolle swiftkick,"I purchased the Swiftkick to use with my SOS prescription adapter that I have with my Bolle Vigilante. Unfortunately, each frame that uses the SOS adapter has a special adapter. I can see well enough without my adapter that I can still use the glasses at least to run (I bought an adapter for the frames, so I can now use them to drive in as well).That being said, I like the styling of the frames, and really liked the Modulater lenses for the glasses. The Modulater Rose is unlike most other Rose lenses I have had in the past, in that when I remove them on a bright day everything is not green!I just want to make sure that you know that the prescription adapters for the various frames are NOT interchangeable. The Bolle website does not make this readily apparent.I like the fact you can interchange lenses. I use a clear lens to run in at night and on trails. I wish that someone would come up with a package deal to get 3 or 4 lens colors in a package instead of buying them 1 at a time."
5,Awesome!,"In my opinion, I think this deck is cool. Although this deck is missing some of the good cards, if you work with all the cards with strategy, the cards can become good. I think The red eyes black dragon is pointless, it's attack is nothing. Thousand Dragon...you gotta be kidin me. There are way better card than those. But other than that, this deck is pretty good...for beginners, this deck is good, because it'll boost your deck, and the experts, buy the Pegasus Deck, alot better.Anyways...anybody know where to get the Egyptian God Cards?"
3,I was dissapointed,"Sure, you can play with the dark magician, and the BEWD, just like yugi on TV, but I was dissapointed in the complete lack of strategy this game offered. it seems to be mostly about who can get the biggest monster. gameplay left me board and feeling slighted. I want my money back if anyone wants to buy my cards off me...trust me, they're in good condition - they haven't bee used much. I suggest a *real* game, like Magic the Gathering...even pokemon was ok, when compared to this... I'd say that if there were no TV show, this CCG would've already flopped, and moved on...this seems to be another fad, just like pokemon, Card captors, and *shudder* rumble robots"
5,how to get the best deck,"The only way to get the best deck is to combine your decks. Take the Strongest cards from each of the 4 Starter decks and combine them(have around 60-80 cards). It also helps if u have a lot of rare cards from booster packs. I have lots of rare cards from my friends giving them to me and throgh trades and good luck. It also helps to have more than 1 deck i have 2(a deck with 3 Blue-eyes and a deck with 3 D.Magicians). Both of my decks are extremely powerful(I am the Best duelist in my city, I have only lost about 15 out of 120 duels). My final tip is to duel for cards, this means who ever wins gets to keep cards they picked at the begining of the duel, I have never lost any of my cards(Only for experianced duelists). I hope you found this useful. This is my favorite game."
2,AHHH!!!,"THIS IS THE WORST STARTER DECK.JOEY'S CARDS R WEAK,. EVEN MY DECK COULD BEAT IT WITHOUT MY TOONS AND POLI.THIS WEAK.PEGASUS IS THE BEST DECK.NNOO MATTER WUT."
2,"Shop manual ""wannabe""","Not sure why it is called a shop manual. A guy in a shop who is depending on this ""shop manual"" is in real trouble. It is not very comprehensive. The index is wrong, for example- information on the oil pump is not found on the page listed for oil pump info. Parts of the manual are fairly comprehensive but I found it lacking in many areas. It appears to be a botched reproduction of manual that really was a good one. I found the same manual in a tractor store for twice the price, so it is probably worth the money although one would have to seek out other sources of information to ""fill in the gaps""."
4,very informative,i recommend this book for anymore who might be looking for a manual for their ford n series tractors. i recieved mine just the other day and its great. the only problem with the manual is the index is alittle off on things but the book is good in getting you started on the road to fixing and repairing your tractor. pictures of parts and instruction is well done
3,Will not load on Windows 7,"Exciting concept of flying a gunship from the other side of the Iron Curtain, but this old game just won't load itself up on a Windows 7 platform! A pity!I hope the software developer will get this game up to date!"
4,slow start but don't give up,"The first 200 pages felt tedious. The character development felt lacking... I couldn't relate to any character, nor did I feel connected to any of them. I'm glad I didn't give up though. The story built slowly and by the middle I couldn't put it down. Gedge does a tremendous job of giving the reader a real sense of the time period and the perspectives of both sides of the ""argument""."
5,"Grandmas, Toy Trains & Donuts!","Annie and I have both been enjoying ""Spinning Tails."" The song ""Fishtank full of Guppies"" captures the kind of ""stream of conscious"" dreaminess that many of us have felt peering into a fish tank. Annie and I are both donut hounds (for Donut Man Blues) and my sister's kids have a big train set-up (Make Believe Town) so there's something for everyone! our favorite is probably ""Grandma's Video Camera"""
1,Terrible Book,"Allen knows zilch about the Balkans, knows nothing about the war, prattles on incessantly about herself. Seems she heard some horrifying stories of mass rapes from acquaintances and decided to write about how bad that made her feel. That's it. If you care about that, then this book is for you."
4,Best starter Deck,"The reason I nominate this the best Yu Gi Oh starter deck is because you get the ultimate Relinquished.It has the power to take another {opponent's} card's attack and defence.E.g. Your opponent summons the amazing Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon, use the effect of Relinquished and you will have the power of Blue Eyes Ultimate.You also get some other pretty powerful cards in the deck."
4,A pretty good deck...,"My sister got this deck for her birthday, and she loves it! It has some good cards, like the Toon Monsters, and some Magic and Trap cards... My sister's Deck has quite a few cards from at least 3 starter decks (Joey, Pegasus, Yugi) She has all the Toon Monsters except for the Japenese Dark Magician Girl. But anyway, I kind of like this deck, but I'd personally prefer the Joey or Kaiba, maybe the Yugi. Ah well. Buy this deck, I'd recommend it- Even thought my deck has only one or two cards from it... IT'S TIME TO DUEL!!! (Sorry I could'nt resist!! ;)"
3,"a simple, bland game of ""summon the monster""","I was saddened when I discovered how bad this game is. I wanted it to be like the TV show, (Yes, even us 'older'[17y.o] folk like our cartoons^_^) but this card game can't hold a candle to the strategy of other games, like Magic the Gathering..."
4,Grades,"Overall very goodRap/Hip Hop: 9/20: Comments: Pon De Relpay is overplayed, Destiny's Child sucks, who exactly is Lyfe Jennings. He needs to get a life before he sings again. BPop Rock: 10/20: Lives and dies as half of album is Pop/ Rock. Mixed feelings. B-Country: 1/20: Bad song from 2002. Come on at least put in Gretchen Wilson. DOverall: C+"
2,Poor Compilation,Let me give you the rationale behind their song choices.Ready?1...2...3...RADIO (i.e. COMMERCIAL HUMDRUM)!And that should explain everything.

5,loved it,"I saw a live version of the play recently and missed a lot of the dialogue because of the English accents and unfamiliarity of the script. So, I rented the dvd and totally enjoyed it. You might need to rewind here and there so that you can get a chance to understand the dialogue but it was very well done and fun. I highly recommend it."
1,horrible-doesn't derserve any stars,"This book is nothing more than a ""coming of age story"" from the writer's cookie cutter. There are a million books just like it. Nothing special at all. Chapters are repetitive and dull. Overall a bad book with a predictable ending. GOod book to read if you're trying to fall asleep quickly at night"
2,GOOD START--THEN DOWNHILL,AFTER THE FIRST 10 PAGES---I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GOING RIGHT WHERE I WANTED TO GO.WELL--NOT SO.I REALLY HAD TO STRUGGLE TO FINISH---ESPECIALLY THE LAST 100 PAGES OR SO.THERE WERE PARTS OF THE BOOK THAT WERE MEANT TO BE HUMOROUS---BUT---WERE NOT---I FOUND THESE TO BE OFFENSIVE---SORRY.
5,Its Siemens so what more is to say,It is a Siemens product so we trust it with our lives with our exercise pool. We are still alive. Life is good!
3,Meh,"As SF mystery goes, Polaris has some things going for it. The characters are interesting and engaging, and the lead in for the mystery is nicely done. The clues are a little heavy-handed, making the mystery overly easy to solve, but not so much as to ruin the story altogether.It's in setting that this story really fell apart for me. Another review mentioned that the story could be set in the US of 100 years from now and would still work - that's because all the characters are generic 20th century Americans! In a society supposedly several thousand years into the future people still have ""typical girlhoods"" with tricycles and ice cream cones, wear little black dresses with stiletto heels for parties, and a hundred other things that scream modern day American. I'm sorry, but moving into the far future involves more than providing people with skimmers, AI's and the occasional spaceship.I enjoyed the read, but found it substantially irritating as well."
4,Pretty Good,"Not the best McDevitt has written, but still pretty good. Kept me reading through it fairly quickly. The whole story is intriguing enough, although it does start out a bit slow IMO. McDevitt also manages to stay away from one of my common problems with his books, which is that they are entertaining, but not plausible at all. This one just is a lot more believable (for a scifi book), and unlikely coincidences occur a lot less often.I would recommend this book to scifi fans, but do not expect it to be the best you've ever read."
3,O.k. but a little irritating,"I found good points and bad points. The good is that I like McDevitt's writing. The quality of his writing is a step above most science fiction writers. Unfortunately that's also part of the bad because the book dragged enought that I was drawn into noticing the technical quality of the writing. More irritating was the repeated use of the same plot technique. Gee, the lights won't turn on. That can't mean that the bad guys are around, so lets go on in. Gee, the computer doesn't seem to be working right. That can't mean that there's something wrong with the space ship, so let's take off. It reminded me of the TV shows where the person says, ""I can't tell you the secret information on the phone, but meet me tomorrow, and I'll tell you in person."" Guess who's going to die before tomorrow? This flaw really detracted from the book for me because I couldn't get into a story where the two heros were so blind. The story itself is o.k.; I just wish it had been told better."
3,Sci-Fi Who-Dunit,"I gobbled up McDevitt's last three novels, DeepSix, Chindi and Omega. So without hesitation, I sprung for Polaris without waiting for the softcover.I have to say though, that I was a bit dissapointed. The novel, a story of what happened to the crew of the Polaris, reads much like a mystery who-dunit: pages and pages of the two lead characters interviewing suspects and chasing leads.Now, if you like this sort of thing, you'll find an intelligent story with an satisfying ending.But I guess I wasn't up to the task of slogging through 250 plus pages before things got really going ... or probably the real reason is, I'm just not that big of a fan of this type of novel.But again, I did enjoy the ending and the rather fascinating ethical questions it raised. And I'll probably be buying McDevitt's next novel ... before it comes out in softcover."
4,A Novel Based on Chappaquidick and the Drowning of Mary J. Kopechne,"This novel is based on the Chapaquidick incident with Ted Kennedy and Mary J. Kopechne. It is told from the perspective of 'Kelly Kelleher' as she lays dying in the over-turned car underwater. She relives her infatuation and awe with the famous senator, his attraction to her and ultimately, his desertion of her to save his own life. Her naivete, gullibility, idealism, foolishness and youth are all too apparent as she faces death all alone. At this existential crisis, she is still unable to believe the the man she so idealized has sacrificed her so easily and without even a thought.Like all of Oate's books, this is well-written, dark, and hard to put down. It held my interest all the way through. It is that rarity of books, a literary page-turner."
4,"""black water - a fantastic fiction""","The Senator. The girl. The Fourth of July party on the island. The ride through the night. The accident. The death by water.But as a reader, you are never left to wonder about Joyce Carol Oates shocking story, her words are full of outrage and shock and the novel itself is presented in part from the narrative voice of a young girl who made a fateful decision, for all the wrong reasons, on a pretty Summer day after a party where a story on the quality of a surreal nightmare begins.Finally she dies in the car that the Senator drove and during her death the reader enters her past and present, her romantic and idealistic dreams of a brave future and her whole life."
3,Not impressed,Had to read this for English 101 in college. Wasn't the best of books. Eventually got through it...and got an A in the class. I guess thats all that matters in the end.
3,Difficult for foreigners,"A great novel! I was impressed by the power of the words, the power of the feelings, the power of the whole book. Negative aspect: a little bit difficult to read for students of the high school from other countries with other languages as I am one. I think the language level is too high for students, so I suggest to read this book with good english skills only. But anyway: fascinating, interesting and in the end even exciting! You won't regret your choice!"
3,"A good value, but could be better.","Overall this adapter is a good value for the money. I am a bit concerned by the thinness of the plastic mounting arms, and I had to make a shim to go between the body of the radio and the storage pocket to prevent it from twisting. Some work was required to get the radio to sit at the right depth and alignment to the factory opening, requiring several trips in and out of the dash."
1,Didn't work,The battery basicly didn't work when I received it. My PSP wouldn't come on with this battery inserted but it would start with my original battery.I recommend that you avoid this battery and purchase an original battery instead of a Datel battery.
3,pretty much only covers enormous houses,"I find the title of this book incredibly misleading. For her, ""not so big"" means ""integrated with nature"" as opposed to, well, ""not so big""! Almost all of the houses in here are enormous (without counting I'd say maybe 38 of the 40 she talks about), so it's not very helpful for someone like me with a smaller house. Granted, she says her ""starter home"" was a large Victorian in Boston with a wrap-around porch and stained glass windows, so her perspective is bound to be different from the average American's! But unfortunately I had a hard time applying her concepts to my smaller home (on a 1/4 acre lot), and found myself heartily annoyed because the title had promised something that perhaps might be more useful to someone like me."
5,MA thesis resource,I am using this book as a resource for my MA thesis. This book's author is writing from a sociological perspective but I am using it under the philosophy education umbrella regarding a law that I believe was designed to purely to hold back minorities and poor whites.
2,A Real Disappointment,"Luzamo above had it exactly right. Why fix it if it ain't broke? You know, if I had known they were going to put out a hardcore/Nu-metal/sludge metal record, I would have advised Geezer to go with his experimental keyboard stuff instead (which he was too lazy to craft in the studio). At least that at least would have been bold and interesting, unlike OHMWORK, which is neither innovative nor original nor METAL."
1,"boring, boring",I bought this book because after seeing the movie I had a lot of questions I thought would be answered. The book and the movie do not resemble each other at all. Some of the characters have the same names but that is as close as it gets. The stories in each are completely different. Nothing matches anything. The book is so boring to read it put me to sleep. It just rambles on and on. Usually the book is better than the movie. This is not the case. At least the person that wrote the movie completely changed the plot to make this story interesting. Reading this book was a waste of time and money.
5,Wonderful prose written by a master.,"Beautifully written story about the lonelness we all feel with a great loss in our lives. I have not seen the film, but am anxious to see how they pull this off."
5,perfect for my deck,This was easy to assemble and puts out enough heat to make my 10' x 20' deck comfortable on chilly nights
5,AWESOME Prodcut!,"I wasn't expecting much when I purchased this product for my daughter, but WOW was I surprised. The quality is amazing! Everything is nicely embroidered and beautiful! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!"
5,It works well,"I have been using this product for at least 7 years. I used it on my Audi S4, lexus RX450h and also on BMW 550i. Like any product you should know its limitations. It is not an impeneterable armor, however, it is extremely effective in protecting against birds'droppings and road grime. I do not exaggerate when I say that a wet piece of tissue will immediately wipe off such contaminations without a trace. Otherwise, you will have to exert pressure in rubbing off this nasty stuff and in the process you will create swirl marks. I have not been using other products on the paint of my cars."
5,Courage in the face of a great trial,"I enjoyed this book very much. Since our family experienced a horrible car accident nearly two years ago that has left our brilliant, now 11-year-old, daughter fully dependent on caregivers, I could relate to much of what Philippe and Stephane shared. It is most helpful to know we are not alone in our feelings of sadness, anger, and determined hope. I would love to learn more about this courageous family."
2,A disappointment,"Personally, I've never found Bernie Mac funny at all. It's unfortunate that I picked up this audiobook read by him. Now I think that not only is Bernie Mac not funny, he also sounds like a Jerk. This book is the story of his life, it's a sad life punctuated by the loss of his mother when Bernie was 16. It's obvious that Bernie had a rough life, and his rise to stardom was an impressive one that included doing stand up at church at age 8. However, it's so depressing throughout the entire work you'll want to throw the tape out by hour 2 of this 4 and half hour abridgement. At no time is any part of this book funny, and the reading by Bernie Mac is delivered so flat as to seem monotone. I don't think Bernie was trying to make himself sound selfish, but that's really how it feels towards the end of the work. I feel bad, but I have to recommend not spending your money on this product."
4,the mac daddy rollercoaster ride,"This bio had me holding on and reading it like the rollercoaster ride that it is. The story of a lifetime of crying and laughing was so intense from one chapter to the next that I realized I too was crying and laughing at the turn of the page. It's sad that his life ended so early. It's for certain he would have had more pearls of wisdom, either written or verbal, to share in his own distictive style. Yeah, Bernie! When you get to the pearly gates tell St. Peter you've been chosen as the comand performance entertainnment."
2,A nostalgia trip if nothing else.,"I didn't buy this book expecting to be informed. Generally, if I see a book on hacking in the mall, I mark it as lame. However, I figured it would be a good laugh, so I bought it. What I got was a return to my childhood. Back when the XT and the Apple II were high tech. Back then, these methods actually worked. Alas, if you don't live in a rural area that has yet to see indoor plumbing, this book won't be much help. In fact, all of it is pretty much common sense and *WAY* outdated. If you use the stuff in this book, expect to get caught. Old timers like me will dig this book for the memories alone. Newbies, on the other hand should steer very clear. If you're reading this, then you are probably online. Save some money and look up everything you can on computer security. You'll learn more about modern hacking online and you won't have to waste money on something soooooo outdated."
1,This book was a complete Joke.,"This book is sickening. I find it harsh that someone would actually waste time writing such a horrible book. I am a Unix sysadmin, and can honestly say that there is absolutely nothing in this book even remotely related to Hacking."
1,I got my money back,"This book was so bad and so outdated, I sent it back for a refund. I DO NOT recommend Super Hacker to anyone curious about hacking. This book is a rip off!"
1,A complete waste of time,This book gives nothing of value. It doesn't tell you anything about true hacking. The guy who wrote this book gave a brief history of some snooping around he did at work.
3,"The Knightmare is cool, but the book is out dated.","The Knightmare and The Mentor inspired me to become what I am. The book is alright..To be honast, I went to sleep in the middle of it."
1,Don't be fooled by the cool cover,"Yea it looked cool in the store, I soon found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages, then chapters looking for the good stuff (something more then common sense) I didn't find much, you can learn 10X as much in an hour or two in the web. He actually tells you how to look through garbage dumpsters, thanks, like I wouldn't be able to improvise...."
2,TALK ABOUT DISTORTION,"This book gives people who are clueless about hacking the wrong idea. Its points people in the wrong direction and it gives hackers a bad name. Theres only one way to be a good hacker, reading and research. You can't just read one false-titled book and expect to be another Phiber Optik."
2,Older Methods Than ME,"I got this book for a birthday present, all I can say is this book is *ok* for someone wanting a book to read, but it really has nothing to do with hacking, mostly all it talks about is carding (credit card fraud) and warez (software piracy) and the little details it does tell are very outdated and uneffective"
5,Great for Spanish learners,"My four year old knows ""Brown Bear"" by heart in English so reading it to him in Spanish is a fun way for him to become familiar with the language. We have the whole series plus ""Good Night Moon"" in Spanish."
5,"Oso pardo, oso pardo, ¿qué ves ahí?","Excellent resource trade book. Good translation of Brown Bear, Brown Bear."
4,"""Spectacular Variety of Insight""","This book has a great exsposition of finely tuned and insightful quotes. There are just over one-hundred and fifty quotes in all, and I found everyone of them to make a significant impact upon my spirituality as a Christ-growing man.These quotes go straight down to the marrow of personal problems and as well family predicaments, and prove themselves to be very helpful in any matter that may be a hindrance in your life. This book is compact and may be taken anywhere and read at anytime.T.D. Jakes has done it again by placing words of wisdom in a convenient and accessible manner. So due to the contents and the powerful words of Mr. Jakes, I would urge anyone to pick up a copy of this wondeful book of quotes."
5,MOVIE,"A GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL AGES,, QUICK AND DEPENDABLE PACKING AND DELIVERY,,,PRICE WAS GOOD TOO.. THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE,,, I SHALL CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR MY FAVORITES IN THE FUTURE"
5,Homegrown by Lisa Phenix,"This is an entirely biased review of the CD Homegrown by my friend Lisa Phenix aka ""Silly Little Mama"". I love her Americana and Blues based original songs. Until they are posted here, you can find samples and published review at www.lisaphenix.com. Enjoy."
5,Great Album,"I loved this album, very original. I went ahead and purchased everything she has done. I am a big fan!"
2,Not incredibly helpful,I read this book looking for some general information on study abroad and found it to be rather unhelpful. I think that students would be better served by going to someone in their school's study abroad office instead of buying this book.
4,OK - I guess,"This worked for our 1994 Suburban, but it did not fit quite right. It sets about 1/2 an inch down further in the dash than the original piece and because it is right next to the glove box, you can tell it is quite a bit lower. Not the fault of the seller, just made that way."
3,not the greatest,"I'll start off with what i liked:1. It can clip right on your laptop, or you can stand it up anywhere.2. It was a good price3. It takes ok videos4. Was delivered very quickly, less than 48 hours.Why I was dissapointed:1. Has a built in microphone, but is awful. It captures audio (not very well), but there is a horrible buzzing in the background i couldn't fix.2. I was excited about the lights that come attached, but, they are pretty much worthless. you cannot turn them off or on when you want b/c it has a sensor. when they do come on, they are not that bright and really dont do anything."
4,Works great,"I haven't tried any other products, but this one really helps me to focus and gives me extra stamina to get in a great workout. I'll have to try others to have something to compare too though. I like it."
3,It's the caffeine,"The thing they don't say in the ad is there is a bunch of caffeine and other stimulants in this stuff. It does give me energy, and I get a nice focus and drive while lifting, but I haven't noticed any other benefits yet. I workout at night so I'm hesitant to use it regularly because I don't want it to screw with my sleep."
2,Inaccurate description,"The product's description is inaccurate. The product does not contain ANY creatine. Upon calling the company, the support staff offered to exchange the product for creatine for free, and w/o shipping costs incurred to me. They resolved the problem for me, but I am disappointed to see they chose not to update the product description, and mislead other potential buyers."
1,Severe Sleeplessness,"Wow. I bought this yesterday, did the suggested '30-minute' trial run on one scoop - had no issues. This was done SEVEN HOURS before my normal bedtime. Guess what? It's now 6am and I'm having to go to work on 45 minutes of sleep. This stuff had me high-wired all night long. I'm hoping my military Exchange will refund my money back once I show the manager some of these reviews which, unfortunately, I did not read in advance of buying. Stupid purchase. Lesson learned."
3,Not for newbie cooks!,"It's quite the bible of food and cooking. I found the explanation of certain food groups and handling helpful. For example, what types of meat are from what parts of animals, and the oils and consistencies differ. But as a newbie cook, I found little joy and little cooking. It's a good reference book, but much too intimidating. There's not enough beginner-type of explanations of cooking terminology or food prep techniques (nor are there pictures to help out)."
4,A cyberpunk classic,"I'm amazed there's no reviews of this. Back in the day, it was considered a cyberpunk classic. Probably not quite as great as neuromancer but a good follow up read if you want something ""different but similiar"" (the classic SF fan's request for reading materials after a new favorite).Interstate commerce with anti-aircraft missiles, drugs, gangsters, cybernetics. near orbit stations, heroes with implants, all a man or woman could wish for in a cyberpunk future with just a hint, a wee hint, of a Western.Inspired a supplement for the Cyberpunk RPG.All in all, I enjoyed it greatly."
1,Wrong Poster,I did not receive the poster that I ordered. Instead I received a bob marley rasta poster that although cool was not the intended purchase. I had purchased the poster as a replacement for a friend whose original was destroyed by my pet and ended up with a completely different one.
5,"Very handy, great idea","The Stanley rotator ratchet is a great idea. By turning the handle you can get the nut ""started"" on the threads. Terrific for working in tight areas. It's made in China, it seems to be well made. The price is right. It makes a great gift for the home mechanic."
5,"colorful, joyful telling","This is a great version of this classic song. A little boy is left in charge of his grandparents' farm and things begin to go wrong right away.The layout encourages singing along though it's not necessary -- you and your kids will still enjoy these funny and colorful watercolor animals as they joyfully misbehave.Fun, lively, colorful."
3,Okay read,"Abby, a new hire at a bucolic regional hospital, in a bucolic California mountain town, finds herself up against a corporate giant. People are showing up in her ER with strange symptoms thought to be part of industrial poisoning. While that theory is a good one, the more she digs around on behalf of her patients, the more trouble she finds herself in.Save for some continuity errors and a couple of obnoxious thriller cliches, Critical Judgement is pretty good for a medical thriller."
5,Outstanding book!,This was the first book of Plamers that I read and could absolutely not put it down. Since this book I have read everyone of his books and just loved them all. This book was so suspensful and kept you on your toes! Read it!
2,contrived,"This book started out fine, but quickly lost my interest. I have enjoyed other books by Palmer. This one just didn't come together for me. Not tightly written, I found my mind wandering as I tried to read it. Was glad when it was over."
1,Don't waste your money,"This thing is a piece of junk.I made the mistake of buying one.First of all it has very little suction.You have to pump this over and over.The hoses continually come off.The worst part is that it leaks.I tried siphoning gas from a gas can to my car.There was gas all over place, especially on my hands.I am going to take it back to where I bought."
4,Good stuff,"If you like Peter Cetera you will like this CD. Some great, some just good. None bad. Enjoy the songs and music"
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I have to agree with prior reviewers, though the vocals are good it's very difficult to hear the band in the background. For the price, it was worth the money, but I will go with the reviewers next time."
3,The Best of Peter Cetera Live,It's still a good cd but i like the original version better. He changed how he sang most of it.
5,Love it!,"I was a skeptic of pressure cooking. I had images of the horrible crock pot meals I occasionally ate at friend's houses while growing up. This cooker has been wonderful! The ease of operation, meat tenderizing abilities and quality of construction is worth every penny. Go for the 7 qt or bigger if you are planning on cooking for more than 2 people on a regular basis. I'm so glad I made this purchase. My husband couldn't figure the thing out (funny) and called customer service. They were very capable of walking him through the process. Good company."
5,Those Other Years,"I happen to own this book. I sat with him time and time again and was amazed on how much he remembered in 1996. He gave me a book and wrote, To Feline, 18-96, With Best Wishes C.O. Peterson.I've enjoyed the book many times over."
4,My Life and Music,"What an interesting book. For anyone who is a pianist, this book is a must in their library. The book is divided into two parts. The first is biographic while the second covers lectures given at university. This biography was not one of those straight forward ""I did this and that."" What I found most interesting about this book was how much Schnabel talked about the social history and way of life in late nineteenth century Europe. Not only as it related to music but the arts in general. Schnabel is so eloquent and intelligent that while you're reading this book, you get the feeling that you're actually living the musical experience with him. Piano enthusiasts will appreciate this book in order to have a better feel for what kind of life style a concert pianist lived a hundred years ago."
1,Can NOT get replacement parts,"I'm now stuck with three telephones that I can not get a replacement handset. Other handsets do not work well on this phone so I find I'm out of luck. The handsets are fragile and break easily. I now have to replace all my phones. Here is the reply from AT&T/Advanced American Telephone...Dear Jim,Thank you for your recent inquiry to our Customer Service Help Desk.Unfortunately, Advanced American Telephones does not sell the handsets or the bases as separate parts of our products.We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.Sincerely,MarlonNational Service CenterAdvanced American Telephones"
5,Great book for young girls,My daughter has almost all of these Americal Girls collection hardcover books and she LOVES them. She reads them over and over again and learns some history with each one.
1,Hawking Must Be The Master Of Time + Space!,"Hawking must be the all time master of time and space, as the intro for this set claims that it contains over 8 spell-binding hours! Yet the data field on the set's specs states this set contains only 1 Disc. Oh, the magic of today's universe unfolding with wonder, perhaps trapped inside a simple DVD Case, or maybe this Disc converts your DVD Player into a Multi-Dimensional cosmic rift, played in a never before seen String Theory. Buy It Quickly People! Before It Begins To Collapse In Upon On Itself!!!!!!!!!!!!! *LOL* Ciao, People. Shelby"
2,It can't be called Lounge music,"Any music that uses electronic beats as the backbone of the music and not as something to supplement and adorn organic beats & rhythms should never be considered as ""Lounge Music""Enough said"
4,"Rare, innovative design, weird handset","I bought this phone free after rebate and it's one of those rare tiny phones with the keypad in the base. This makes it an ideal wall phone. I can't say it's useful as a desk phone as the base slides around despite it's heavy weight. The keypad in the base is a good plus for a phone this inexpensive--usually you need to get a much more expensive speaker phone just for buttons in the base. If you spend a lot of time with voice-response systems, as many of us do with voice mail and such, this telephone is the most convenient way to do it for the least money.The handset is weird. The microphone is entirely too skinny and if you're a shoulder-holder you probably won't like the phone. The handset cord is long enough but it's the cheap dull-finished kind that gets dirty easily. Get a nice AT&T; Tuff Cord to replace it."
5,Wonderful fun,"I love the imagery in this book. Knowing the Dorset area a bit makes the story live for me.I really have enjoyed all the Black Lace books I have, the descriptions of love making are a lot more 'romantic' and sexier than those stories especially written for men - which I am."
1,"Trashy, cheesy music -- and not in a good way","MOS's The Annual is always fairly mainstream and pop-oriented, but this is far below the quality of some past years. These songs, with only few exceptions, are what you'd hear on the worst dance music stations in the U.S. Tons of uninspired trance with random female vocals. Tons of remakes of classic tunes, and not particularly good ones. Cheese everywhere, and not the enjoyable kind.It's amazing they could find 3 CD's worth of this junk. Save your money. Save your soul."
5,No soundtrack from the film Brother Sun-Sister Moon,"No soundtrack from the film Brother Sun-Sister Moon was producedand what a shame, such beautiful music in the film sung byDonovan yet no soundtrack was produced.Buddy Comfort sings all the wonderful music from this outstandingbeautiful movie. I have this music CD and its rare andworth every cent to own it and sung with the wonderful voiceof Buddy Comfort."
5,Works well,"I got this to use in my truck when I'm out in the country, going off road, or just need to find a new destination in the city. It has 2 points of adjustment so you will always be able to get it in just the right spot for you to see. also the suction cup works great. good product!"
2,Disappointing,"I'm not sure if it is the ""team writing"" or what exactly fails in this novel, but I found it to be a disjointed and jerky read.The plot lines were all over the place and there were so many character names brought in to the story but never filled out.Eventually I just didn't care who was who.I loved the Nanny Diaries, but this book most definitely didn't capture the same magic."
3,Fine but nothing unique,"This book is perfectly fine if you can't be bothered to seek out most of this information online. The authors' own websites are actually some of the best places to start. But the book is useful, even down to the entire chapter devoted to analyzing Netscape 4's CSS abilities--something most others will simply not cover.However, the price of this book is about two times too high. It's short, with no CD, but it runs as much as many of the ""phone-book"" tech books. This is a fifteen-dollar value, no more."
5,Great Rice Every Time!,"This is my first rice cooker and I love it! It makes great rice every time. I have made white, brown and jasmine rice so far, they all came out fantastic. I eat rice every day now and I feel great!Pros- Small size, good for one person or a small family.- Changes to keep warm mode after rice is done so it doesn't burn or get cold.- Retractable cord- Three cooking modes- Countdown timer starts at 13 minutes- Delayed start timer- Very durable- Easy to clean (except one part, see below)- Great price!Cons- The unit has an inner lid with a small valve that may be difficult to clean if you don't have a dish washer."
5,Perfect for laptop users,"I use my Dell laptop docked into a docking station. I leave the laptop closed because I want to use my bigscreen monitor. However, when the laptop is closed I no longer have access to the volume controls. This is the only product I've found to provide external volume control. While it can do a whole lot more for power users, I'm a simple guy with simple needed. Let me turn off the volume quickly when the phone rings or the wife comes in. This works perfectly for that application and worth the money alone. All the extra stuff is gravy. I had no problems installing this, but others have reported some issues. I think this product has probably just matured with age and simply works now. I love it."
4,A varied and elegant Souvenir,"Anna Bergman has given us a delightful and varied collection of musical selections that show off her lovely even voice and her ability to deliver the texts inner meaning.The selections, all in the original keys, display her wide vocal range and well balanced tone. She is able to sing in the rich and lusty low register with the same ease that she displays in the top soaring tones of her voice.I hope to hear more from her soon."
2,vista?,"ok be careful with vista. officially creative does not have a vista driver for this one. creative does support vista on other products. this is too old. Microsoft will say it is not compatible with this camera at all. the last driver for it was xp 64 bit. it is hard to find it now. If you have vista you can get it to work with some tweaking. simply download the right driver for your system x86 or x64 in XP format. then here is the secret, right click the driver exe and go to properties. then compatibility. click run in compatibility for windows xp. then click ok and run the driver installation. it will work in vista. be sure to unplug the camera first and then plug it in when asked. and voila, I am using mine in vista right now :)"
1,"Was good, now bad",I was happy with this camera and creative products in general until I tried to install it on a vista machine. That's when I found that creative does not support it's products. I would never buy another creative product again.
3,Amazingly Average,"The product though cheap is one of those where you get what you pay for. The video quality is not great by anyones imagination. In terms of staying on a flatscreen moniter or laptop it works only as long as the device is very still(aka, no laptop on the lap), Also very hard to adjust becuase once you start moving it, it will fall off or slip. The free headset works fine, and it is plug and play with AIM messenger. So that was very easy, and it does do the job. HOWEVER SOFTWARE DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS VISTA....I was dissapointed this was not stated cleary."
3,"Works on XP, OK Picture Quality, NOT for Vista","There are much better available, avoid this ""Creative Webcam"" unless you are getting it cheap and are only installing it on an XP PC. It does not work on Vista.It did install fairly quickly on my XP PCs (we have 3 of these webcams) and performs well enough for video chatting. The picture quality is just OK, nothing special. The included software is also OK and does what you expect it to do.Not recommended."
4,A thinking person's mystery,"Arturo Perez-Reverte's margelous literary thriller The Club Dumas combines several great themes - the love of (and lust for) antiquarian books; the discovery (or re-discovery) of an original Dumas manuscript; and a long-missing satanic tome which, it seems, contains the key to re-conjure the devil himself. Perez-Reverte is a wonderful companion and story-teller: he is both scholarly and erudite in his expositions of the world of rare books and famous writers; he also writes good (although sparing) sex and violence. This is the thinking person's mystery, and a book which I will soon re-read."
3,"Initially intriguing, ultimately unsatisfying","If you love mysteries and old books, as I do, this story will hook you from the start. Perez-Reverte puts his research about Dumas, the occult and rare book buyers to good use. Unfortunately, if you take away these interesting tidbits, the weaknesses in the plot and main characters becomes apparent. I read with enjoyment and willingly suspended disbelief until the main character's ""love affair"" with the mysterious young woman. Even then the book remained readable. But the last chapter was so bad I almost wish I had not finished the book, or that I had reread The Name of the Rose instead."
3,Don't expect Jim Morrison,"Author Perez-Reverte performed an amusing trick, using the mystery/thriller genre to showcase his personal interest in books, their collection and value, and literary analysis. He must have realized that writing a scholarly monograph would have difficulty in finding a publisher, much less being profitable to the author. However---by using the red herring of a novel one just might reap monetary rewards including a movie deal. Well, he won that bet---although the story (and reportedly the movie)is weak in the the last analysis.Nonetheless, readers should find the ""loopy"" book (as described by one professional reviewer), entertaining and worth the investment of reading time. Perez-Reverte has a wonderful command of the language with many excellent phrasings, and an ability to spin a yarn. A tip of the hat should probably also go to the translator Sonia Soto.The Club Dumas is only a 3 star because of the weak story and its wrap up. It still rates a read recommendation."
2,"Sadly, only mediocre","The premise of the book definitely has potential to be intriguing, enticing, and unusual, but the potential is just never fully realized. Two separate plots are loosely joined in the novel--the search for demonic books and the answers therein and the half-hearted muddling about a Dumas manuscript--and neither is fully fleshed out. Some of the plot twists are simply silly and the eventual denouments (two, one for each of the plots) are by turns ridiculous and boring. The main character is intriguing, but around him are assembled cardboard cut-outs of characters. Not a terrible novel, but just so much less than it could be. A shame. I was convinced to buy the book solely by the book cover promise that it was a cross between The Name of the Rose and The Three Musketeers--it is, resoundingly, not even close. Rather than buy this book, read (or re-read) either of those other two--it will be a much more satisfying investment of time."
3,pulp Robbe-Grillet,"This is a trickster novel with literary pretensions...but the pretension is mostly about Dumas, basically a pulp novelist himself. So this is a pulp novel about an old pulp novel posing as some kind of high literature. Its quite entertaining for a while, but the plot gimmicks become somewhat tiresome and the end is entirely anti-climactic. The good bits are the details about the Three Musketeers, the parallel references and the mystery of the ""Nine Doors"" - which gets a frisson of excitement going because of the satanist aspects...this isn't fully exploited and you get the feeling that P-R is like Corso: the whole thing is a big tedious joke. In the end, it's like a nouveau roman for high school students - go back and try Robbe-Grillet's ""Erasers"" or ""Maison de Rendez-Vous"" if you want the real thing. David Warner does a pretty good job with the audio version, his voice for Corso being especially good, but even he can't inject sufficient tension into the plot to maintain interest."
4,Book snob? You'll love this.,"Intriguing plot-within-a-plot. Don't let your self-esteem suffer if you can't figure out what the heck Perez-Reverte is talking about--keep on plugging. The translation is excellent, but the story is weak in spots. My rating would have been higher if it were not for an unnecessary sexual violence scene--the point could have been made without it. (Let's not debate whether it's sexually violent. It was to me.) Even so, I'll eagerly await the release of more Perez-Reverte here in the States"
4,A Mystery that finally provokes thought!,"Arturo Perez-Reverte should be applauded for the imagination and pace of his latest novel, ""The Club Dumas"". The characters were interesting, although mildly eccentric, and unlike any the literary community has seen in the last few years. The unique interweaving of multiple storylines with the works of Dumas and all manner of rare occult books, combined for a most amusing and riveting read. Sonia Soto should be commended on a fine translation from the original Spanish. Unlike Varo Borja, the book did not loose its soul in the translation"
5,"Riveting, literate and FUN","I am a little embarassed to say that I discovered this book only after watching the film The Ninth Gate with Johnny Depp and discovering that it was ""based"" on this book. Sort of.The book, as is often said, is SO much better than the movie - so filled with literary allusions, so much more definition in the characters and the plot.If you love literary mysteries, this book is a must read. I read it in 24 hours almost non-stop because I couldn't put it down.In the plus column for Hollywood, it made me appreciate Johnny Depp's characterization so much more after reading the description of Lucas Corso..."
3,"Not Great, but OK","In my opinion, this is a rare instance where the movie is better than the book (I'm referring to ""The Ninth Gate""). I found the constant literary minutia irritating; the author should have just concentrated on the ""Nine Doors"" book. Having said that, it was mildly entertaining."
3,good writing conceals a plot flop,"I began this book expecting something great, but my expectations fell steadily as I read on and on -- and on and on -- until, at long last, I reached the mundane end of what was, at best, an average novel.Readers respond well to high-class mystery tales with literary themes. Unfortunately, the author didn't have the imagination to come up with an extraordinary, unexpected, knockout conclusion. Instead, he hemmed and hawed for the last hundred or so pages while he tried desperately to find a satisfactory ending to the book -- and failed miserably.The good points are that the book is well-written, the story line intriguing, and the mystery is mysterious enough to keep you reading -- albeit with increasing and well justified suspicion that the author has nothing to say and is saying so at great length. I'll give the book three stars because I learned something about Dumas and demonology and the antiquarian book trade."
4,Don't overlook this album!!,"Well, I am please to inform those of that are fans of the Beautiful South that this is a remarkable record considering Paul is on his own. The sound is that of the South and a little bit more. He seems to be experimenting with techno sounds on a couple of tracks, but not too much so that it makes you skip to the next song. I like most of the album and really really dig the rest. It is worth the import price. I should also mention that he seems to be trying out three new female vocalists here since the departure of Jackie a couple of years ago. Only one caught my attention, but they all serve his voice well. If you go to the French Amazon site , you may find it cheaper there. Good luck and enjoy."
3,bypass tray problems,"Very noisy, poor instructions on how to mount it to printer; no guidance that it needed new program and driver from Ricoh to operate from computer (computer wouldn't recognize it; only recognized ""Tray 1""). Ricoh instructions as to bypass tray were almost non existant, and pretty much useless. Took 2 days to get it to work, and it still startles me when it feeds. Seems to work best when ""envelope"" selected on copier slider switch, and when I selected ""thick paper"" in compuer dialog box (tried to print some thin Christmas cards). Nothing in manual or other instructions mentioned this."
4,Can't wait for the album...,"""Colour Blind"" is an incredible song, and Darius is a talented new artist who I'm sure will remain a major part of the British music scene for quite some time. The vocals and lyrics for ""Colour Blind"" are very good. My only complaint is that the lyrics are on the verge of being sappy and commercial. I would also buy this single (I haven't bought it because its an import and a little out of my price range) because it has the video for ""Colour Blind."" I was in London over the summer and saw the video and tried to download it on Kazaa but didn't get to. Anyways, if you think Darius is attractive (like I do) then you'll probably enjoy the video. This single is one amazing song preceeding a most likely amazing album. However, if your low in cash I suggest you hold out for the album. That way you get a great single and a whole album full of great songs."
2,Didn't hold up to my use,"We use these on Garmin Rhino radios and they didn't even last one hunting season before they stopped working. Push button design is nice, but ear bud fits funny and doesn't want to stay put. Distance between the ear bud and the microphone is too far and can't be adjusted. I think Garmin can do better -- we chose Garmin because we had heard that other manufacturer's ear buds might not work."
1,Mostly Erythritol than Stevia!,"I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this product. I thought I was buying pure stevia like other stevia products I used in the past. I knew something was different as it takes a lot more of Stevia Supreme than the other pure stevia products (1/3 of a teaspoon vs. 1/32 of a teaspoon). I finally read the ingredients (should have done this before buying), it is greatly diluted with erythritol. If I wanted erythritol, I would have bought erythritol. They probably do this to increase their profits.I bought Stevia Supreme because it seemed to be a very good value, but it only gives 150 servings for the 5 oz bottle. The pure Stevia products on the market (that I thought I was buying) give you well over 1000 servings for a comparable size bottle. Too bad they are pitching this as a ""stevia"" product instead of a ""stevia blend"". I will read the labels more closely in the future."
4,"Bitter, but tastes better over time.","I wanted a sugar substitute and sodium substitute not because I'm diabetic and have a heart condition, I just wanted to remain healthy. I've looked up aspartame and sucralose, and these chemicals seem more harmful than the calories from sugar.So I decided to try this product.First taste: Absolutely bitter. I could barely stand it. But I did not give up on the product, and after a few more taste packets, I do not find it as bad as the first try. It is an acquired taste. It probably is healthier than the other sugar substitutes out there, and if you can stomach the bitterness, it is a good product to try."
1,Bad business ethics - not honorable!,"I ordered this item (at a discounted price) on May 3rd, 2010 and the delivery date was supposed to be around May 11, 2010 when it was on sale. I then received an email (on May 11th) from Amazon that ""due to lack of availability from suppliers (Stevita Co. Inc.), they no longer can supply me with this product"". I went online to check the product and found that they have increased the price. When a product is being shown online and someone has bought it at a discounted price - Honor it!! If Stevita Co. Inc. intend to increase their Steviat Supreme price on the same day, a customer has ordered - Stevita Co. Inc. has to honor the order - that is good and proper business ethics - Period! I'm cancelling my shopping account with Amazon and stop buying products from Stevita Co. Inc. I'm very disappointed with companies who treat their customers like 'trash' and their business ethics are not honorable anymore."
5,Amazon Made my day,"I just recently purchased the 2 into 1 rca to mp3 jack and am most delighted.Cheap price,works great on my stereo to hdtv.I now have surround sound for $3.25.Sounds fantastic.better than my $500.00 surround sound system..best is no shipping charge and received in 2 days"
1,The definition of a sellout.,"A best of cd is unheard of in punk, and it should be that way. Compilations like this are only ok when the old cd's are out of print. This cd is just a filler either for money or to get out of a contract, not for the fans."
3,"Good Job One The Power Chords Green Day, Now Let's Work On The Solos","There are some good songs on this CD. (By the way, this CD wastifies on American Idiot cuz AI blows) But don't be decieved by these ""Hardcore Punks"" They have absolutly no talent. They just got really lucky. If you are looking to become a ""punk"" pick up a Misfits album, cuz they kick ass. Ramones too."
2,Bad recording,"I love Green Day,.. The problem is that the songs on this CD sounded strange, muffled. I found myself playing with the volume levels instead of enjoying the beat. Brain Stew is my favorite, and the volume level is usually at 11. I had trouble figuring out until I looked at the EQ levels. The CD was over recorded and all the peaks are cut off. Lowering the gain showed a flat frequency response. I am not happy to say the least. My recommendation is to buy the other CD's and make your own ""best of"" collection."
3,Uh?,"OK, there's something missing here. How about ANYTHING from their first 2 albums? International Superhits. Pshh! By far, they needed more from Insomniac, as well. But more importantly, where's ""Green Day"" and ""I Was There""? Or ""2,000 Light Years Away"", which many seem to enjoy(not me, personally)? I own all their albums, and this is certainly not full of superhits. Commercial hits, maybe, with some surprises, but really, Green Day, you owe it to your fans! Give 'em the real stuff! Before Reprise made you superstars! Wouldn't that be the ""punk"" thing to do?"
1,Don't spend your money in this tape !,"This VHS tape is not good as the title looks like. It's all about making japanese food without ""fancy"" ingredients, but I think all people that run and buy it is wondering how to prepare your own sushi -- wich this tape simply won't show. END"
3,good....but the same,"Awake is a good album if you're a fan..or even if you're not. I agree with the idea that it sounds the same as the last album. Awake is a really good song. I think that everyone can agree that when Godsmack makes a good song- it's a REALLY good song. stand out tracks for me are: Awake, Mistakes, and The Journey/Spiral. These songs *for me* make it worth listening to. all in all it's a good disc."
2,what the hell???,"The worst metal album ever. i dont even know why i wasted 15 bucks. damn!!! this album sucks. Godsmack is the same copy of the band Disturbed. Accept disturbed is alot better.The only song which was good is Awake. rest sucks.dont buy if you like slipknot, korn, mudvayne. i thought godsmack was a good band."
2,Nothing special,"Awake thier second albumI checked out this band because I had heard the song Awake and thought that it was unlike the kind of garbage i'd been hearing lately in the music scene. Well i was mistaken, this is more garbage. Sick of Life, Awake, and Greed (the first three songs) are good but after that point I don't know what happened. The rest just sound so dull and boring. Im sure the fans of this band love it but this is a warning to fans of metal to keep thier distance."
1,Boring,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of godsmack, but this album fails. This record should signal one thing, lack of material. Every song sounds the same, and the sound of the record is exactly the same as the first one. This repeative cd really surprised me, maybe next time guys."
1,Worthless,"An aquaintence of mine lent this to me, telling me it was as good as Metallica, maybe even better. My respect for him as a music fan is now pretty much non-existent. Think of the worst songs from Reload (pretty bad huh), now multiply the boringness and shlockness by about 10 and you have the best song on this album. To be honest i can't even tell the difference between each song. They're all just really loud and bland. The musicianship is completely hackneyed and uninspiring. Metal is suppose to have a fast vigorous rhythm section, heavy creative guitar riffs and lots of sudden changes in tempo. Godsmack has nothing, except for loudness and a worthless vocalist who tries to imitate others. There is really nothing that remotely saves this album. Even the cover art is horrible. I get to see the perpetrators of this peice of ..., which just makes me angry."
1,Please save your money,"All I can say is Alice In Chains Rippoffs. These guys make me sick. Don't waste your money, instead buy anything from the great Alice In Chains."
1,It's hard to believe they are still around.,I liked it better when it was called Alice in Chains!!!!!!! They should call their band Zapsmack because I would slap the piercings off the singer if I ever saw that 90 lb. wuss. Songs about witch craft and all that lame hocus pocus mumbo jumbo is about as played out as King Diamond. booooooooooooooo!!!!!!! this band.The Zapper
3,Good but not great,"It's more of the same, which is not a bad thing. If you have the 1st CD buy this one and then try a new band like ""Linkin Park."""
3,"in my opinion it's pretty good, but their first was better","Which I had given 4 stars. The new album is slower, less music you could blast in your car and bob your head to. The fastest song is probably Greed, which can be heard on the radio along with Awake. The installment of two short instrumental tracks, Vampires and The Journey, makes the CD different, also considering it has only eleven tracks. But some songs are good also."
2,not the droids I was looking for,"When I got my Inogen O2 concentrator it came with a really nice nasal cannula. It was a little larger than the normal ones and a lot softer and felt better all the way around. It was of significantly better quality than any I had seen or used before, the kind you could leave your grandkids in your will. I searched for quite awhile to find some just like it on Amazon. When I found this one the name, description, and all the rest of the information seemed to show that I had found the hidden treasure of the Inogens. NOT SO! These are fine as cannulas go and will of course do the job but they are NOT ""the droids I was looking for"""
3,Tropical Steel Drums.,It would be better if the bands were smaller. You hear some great small bands on small islands in the BVIs but this recording is more like an orchestra. A little too formal.
1,Poor,"This book has almost nothing of interest. The routines are poorly designed, the writing is bad and the nutritional advice is woefully outdated. It's one of the worst fitness books that I've read."
1,Very Disappointed Small Business,I purchased 4 of these phones for my small business. They are terrible. While everyone in technical support admits I have tried everything to get the phones to work they do not. I can talk on them but if I put a call on hold and pick it up at a different extension the customer can't hear us....we sound like a Mickey Mouse organization....Avoid these phones no matter how nice customer serivce is they can't help.
4,More than at first listen,"I have to be honest, and say I wasn't overly impressed the first time I listened to this CD. But the second listen made me prick up my ears. There's a lot of soul bearing in the lyrics as well as some hard rocking music. I keep hearing little bits of other bands in there - Radiohead and Bush come to mind immediately. But this isn't, by any means, a rehash of those bands. My favorite cuts are the title cut ""Sleeping With Ghosts"", ""The Bitter End"" and ""Plasticine"". These are angry young men, and they play their music that way. And believe me, they do it very well indeed."
1,Disappointing Book,"This book is heavy on motivation and light on actual how-to. If you need cheerleading about how necessary passion for retailing and customer service is to be successful, then this book is for you. If you are looking for specific information and resources on how to start and run a successful specialty store, then this is not for you."
4,Fascinating.,"The only other book I've read by Batchelor is Buddhism without Beliefs; this one takes a very different approach. It is much more of a scholarly, historical text, tracing the transmission of Buddhist ideas from the East to the West. As a layperson with an interest in the historical development of religions, I found it quite fascinating, recalling similar volumes on the Abrahamic God and the development of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by Karen Armstrong. Like Armstrong's writing, it is usually more than just dry transmission of historical information, also imparting a sense of the beauty and serenity of Buddhism. While it does occasionally drift into less-interesting details, on the whole it is quite an enjoyable read."
1,Damaged product,"The information booklet that comes with Classics CDs had been wet, and all the pages were stuck together making them unreadable. Very disappointing."
2,Poorly written and biased against winter,"I think this is a pretty bad children's book, for two reasons.First, the writing is poor in many ways. Some words are unnecessarily difficult for a young child to understand, and sentence structure and flow are very choppy at times. It's almost as if a third-grader and a twelth-grader took turns writing the sentences.Second, the book claims that Summer is ""good"" and Winter is ""bad"". The two forces initially are at peace, but then Winter starts freezing people. Summer decides to rescue them by warming them up. Then two sides decide to negotiate a peace. Huh? It's just so ridiculous. I would have preferred a story that shows that both summer and winter as being equally valuable, but just different. I get the feeling the author lives up north somewhere and just personally hates the cold."
5,Best Copy of this Album,"If you have an SACD player, this is a must have, especially if you are fond of multi-channel music. It is the clearest version of this album. It has multi-channel and the regular CD version (but most likely the clearest sounding one too). So many details you barely heard before become so crisp.You'll hunger for a Volume II."
3,Americas most wanted playing cards,Bought as a Stocking Filla I didn't open the sealed pack of cards but was disappointed that they were quite a small size. Love the concept though!
3,Good but not Great,"Although the basic story line of this book is good some of the writing gets a bit chopy, expecaly the chapters were Ebonbane is speaking"
1,Don't waste your time...,"This book is incredibly misleading - the author has no authority or scientific data to back up his rediculous claims - esp. his conspiracy thoery that scientists and environmentalists (including Rachel Carson) have been misleading the public for years. I was asked to read this book while working for boaters facing a manatee ""problem"", and was so disgusted and annoyed with the poor writing that I could barely finish it."
5,This Made Me Love Hip Hop!!,"This CD made me not only APPRECIATE Hip Hop music and its intricate rhythms, its poetic nature and its fresh approach to music... it also taught me to LOVE it! What a talent!"
2,Not so easy....,Not as easy as the videos would have you think. While it eventually gets the job done.....it is much harder to do than you expect it will be. I wouldn't have bought it if I had tried it first.
3,gilding the lily,"I thought this program would simplify and augment PSE6, but it doesn't. To put it simply, you cannot gild the lily. What PSE6 can do in 3 steps, this plug-in manages the same task in 8 steps. Soooooo, why bother?"
1,Complete garbage,"This thing does not work as advertised.If you put in some ice cubes and water from the tap, you get some cooling action for about 5 minutes, after that you get a lot of noise from the fan and some added humidity to the room. This is nothing at all like a swamp cooler.I tried completely filling the tray with ice cubes and pouring in 35 degree water chilled in the refrigerator overnight. I got some cooling effect for about an hour, after that it's back to being a slightly humid fan even though the water is still ice cold in the tray. Also, if you add too many ice cubes, the bottom of the tray will consdense and you will have a nice puddle underneath your unit.After two weeks and using it 10 times for spans of 3-6 hours, the fan motor stopped working. I was able to return this piece of junk and am glad to be rid of it. This unit is also apparently branded as the SPT SF-613."
2,Don't buy it for the sounds!,I ordered this for my 3 year old and while he likes putting the puzzle together the sounds are completely random and unreliable. I've tried everything I can think of. Sometimes it makes sounds and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it makes only one letter sound for all the letters. Sometimes it makes some sounds but not others. I've used new batteries etc. But the puzzle is OK if you just remove the batteries. Not worth the price tag though.
2,Better if it's mute.,"I bought this for my 2.5 year-old. I usually love all the M&D toys I purchased for my boys. This is my first disappointment. This puzzle has light sensors and I think this is a bad choice. It annoys me that it is not reliable and it says the wrong letter almost 70% of the time! How is that going to teach a child his ABC? Now that he's 3 and knows all his ABC he will laugh at how wrong this puzzle is, and thinks this is ""silly"". And if this is left in a certain position in a semi lit room, sometimes it will just yell out an alphabet non-stop. Also, this doesn't have an on/off switch button. So to stop the sound, I have to keep it face down so no light can get to it. Now that we have a younger child, we'll just have to take off the batteries in this puzzle for him to play as a normal wooden puzzle so as to prevent teaching the child wrong association to those alphabets! If you do have this, please use it in a well lit (and with even lighting) area."
2,Not good for a garden,"This nozzle turns on and off as advertised, and it can shoot a nice, solid stream of water. But its spray setting is too hard. My wife will not use it for watering her garden. That makes the nozzle useless for our purposes."
3,"""Original"" and ""Ultimate""","This is identified as the ""original"". If this is the original, unknowingly I purchased a copycat a few years ago. The copycat was great and far exceeded our expectations. Based on that experience, we wanted additional nozzles so I purchased this ""original"" as it appeared to be identical except for the name on the nozzle. Very disappointed, this is a case where the copycat trumps the original which is far from being the ultimate."
5,Love it,"I love this nozzel, i bought 2 more for my freind and then 3 more for my dad. They are easy to use and hold onto and no cold water drips down your arm! One of the best finds this year!"
2,Dont bother,"Like others have said, it worked good when we first got it, but mine began to fail and leak after a year of moderate use. I will go back to my cheapies from the department store."
2,Nozzle nothing like what fire department uses,"Although this nozzle was apparently built rugged, I was disappointed with the stream and pressure of the stream that came out in any of the settings. Not pleased with the output or distance of spray. Nozzle now sits in my inventory of other umimpressive garden nozzles and will become a garage sale item. Still looking for that perfect hose nozzle."
1,very disappointed,"weak and pathetic...the cheapo ones I've bought at the grocery store have more spray power than this. We even went out and bought another hose (5/8"") it still didn't work"
3,Lasted 3 years then fell apart,"This nozzle worked well for 3 years. It is very easy to control the rate of water and has a very sturdy feel/construction. Unfortunately the tip of the nozzle fell off after about three years of moderate use (maybe twice a week), making the nozzle useless."
3,hose nozzle,I purchased 2 of these recently and have hooked up one of them so far. It is easy to use but I don't get a lot of power from it like I thought I would. I turned up the water pressure as far as it would go but was not impressed with the level of pressure. Don't really see a lot of difference between this nozzle and the previous adjustable nozzle I had other than this one will probably last longer.
1,Bon-Aire Hose Nozzle,I am very disappointed with this nozzle. It is a very nice nozzle but not worth the price. In order for it to work properly I think you would need the water pressure of a fire hydrant. I have other nozzles that work fine with the water pressure I have but this nozzle is a zero. I would not recommend it at half the price.
2,Lots of water flow needed!,"Sorry, but I have to agree with the other 2 star reviews. If you don't have a 5/8 or better still a 3/4in pipe coming out of your house to your hose this nozzle just won't live up to your expectations or the hype. I have a 1/2in system connected to a 5/8 hose and it just isn't enough water volume and pressure to see the benefits this otherwise well made nozzle has to offer. After seeing it demonstrated at a local garden show I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, however, I get a better and more powerful spray pattern using the ball valve on the end of my hose without a nozzle. With my old fashioned brass twist nozzle I can spray clear across the yard or close it down to a fine mist. You can buy a lifetime supply of cheap brass nozzles for less than the price of one ""Ultimate Hose Nozzle""."
2,3 of them won't come off!,"I bought a house a few years back and heard these things were wonderful. I bought 5 for all my hoses and over time the heads somehow become corroded and won't screw off the hose. I have never had this problem with other nozzles. I tried everything to get them off, even so far as to put the hose in a vise so it can't move and then put a huge wrench on and turn the nozzle. All it did was break the nozzle. I finally gave up and broke out the grinder and cut through one of the sides so I could chisle them off. Great product while it works but the fact that they corrode on to the hose and can't come off in my opinion makes these a poor buy."
4,All stainless or brass & stainless would've been better,"Made in China.Nicely anodized with cleanly formed / cut female threads.If anodizing of the female hose coupling thread wears through, the electrolytic action between the brass male fitting and the aluminum should make a nice battery and cause one of the two corrode.I've had stainless screws in my brass faucet washer stems for years and they coexist very well. NYC water as well as my current well water severely corrodes aluminum."
4,Hoze nozzle,"Good nozzle, does NOT leakMinor complaint, the softest setting is not quite gentle enough for young plants"
5,Quality and Ease of use,"I have used this hose nozzle for over a few weeks now and must say that the build quality is very nice compared to other general nozzle heads that you would find at Lowe's or Home Depot. The 2 way shutoff takes away the hassle of having to turn your nozzle all the way back to shutoff water. The rubber handles are easy to handle, plus it's an added protection when washing your car. Many times I've accidentally dinged my car. All in all, a great product."
2,Disappointed,"I had great hopes for this hose nozzle. It seems very sturdy and well made. I like that it shuts of in either direction. I was just expected a lot more flow. My water pressure is about 60 psi, and the garden hose that I use is a 5/8"". In order to get any pressure or distance, I have to adjust the spray to a fine stream. The wide fire hose spray is very low pressure and doesn't travel very far."
2,Save your $,"Ok it looks cool (billet) and for that is get's 2 stars, but it is not magic it will not improve your water pressure on the hose. I wish I had kept the coin and bought a simple spray nozzle."
5,Perfect nozzle,Nozzle is sturdy and doesn't seem prone to break easily. It has a lot of pressure and is easy to turn on/off.
2,Not worth the price.,"Definitely over hyped. My ten dollar sprayer works better than this. It gets 2 stars because it does spray. That's it. The ergonomics are terrible. The spraying choices are limited. It really comes down to water pressure, if you don't have it, the nozzle can't magically make it better. It may increase it some, but not to the extent that the manufacturer would like to have you believe. You should pass on this."
5,Easy to use..,"I've had a nozzle like this before, and I continue to like it. It is now easier to shut off in either direction. The fog pattern does the job when washing my truck."
1,Home Owner,I bought nozzle little less than 2 month ago. It broke after one month of light usage. To replace it they want $10.95 + plus postage - so much for life time warranty.
5,Crazy nice for high delivery hoses,This is a must have for those with excellent water pressure and volume and a good hose. I highly recommend this.
1,Smells toxic PVC!,This is nice colorful book. But it smells of toxic PVC which made me to return it! Can't give to to baby.
4,Grippjing Novel,This was my first Brqad Thor novel and it is a good one. It's hard to put down as the heros go through NY tring to stop terrorists. It's scary to think that this could actually happen.
1,Utterly forgettable,"This is my first Brad Thor novel and it will be my last. Reads like a shallow action movie - no character development, lots of uninspired run-of-the-mill action, token love interest, etc.I think one of the review titles here sums the book up nicely ""blah blah GUNS blah blah TERROR blah blah COWARDLY LIBERALS blah blah"" - not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn't even do that properly!I have maybe 7 more 3-page chapters to go and you know what, it's not worth my time - it's going straight into the bin."
4,Great Ride. Action Packed,"A very enjoyable ride with ""meat and potatoes"" storyline. Post 9/11 terrorist attack in NYC, well funded terrorist masterminds, Government coverup, ""Jack Bauer"" like protagonist. This may sound like an old formula but it works really well in this book. If your goal is to have a quick, fun, action pack reading experience, this book is for you. Take it for what it is and you'll greatly enjoy it. Reading on Kindle 2, Kindle for Android and Kindle for Ipod touch 3rd gen. Very cool to move from device to device and have the book waiting for you at the right page every time."
5,Great Thriller,"With each novel, Brad Thor seems to be getting better. Though all his novels are great reads, This is probably his best.With non-stop action and a great protagonist--Harvath--Thor's novel takes you on a wild ride that will keep you enthralled to the end. With Brad Thor, you can always expect a great thriller.Highly recommended"
2,Giving up now,"I started the Scott Harvarth series with high hopes because I quite like this genre.Brad Thor however is taking the right wing patriotism way over the top and I first started to skip certain paragraphs, then certain pages and I am now giving up completely."
3,Don't expect much; nonsense ending.,Good read if you aren't expecting much. Characters were not believable as one minute they are portrayed as the best of the best but quickly fade into nothing when the action begins. I also do not enjoy books that tidy up loose ends in a few sentences. The end was ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
2,The Giacomo Casanova Autobiography,"The History of My life by G. Casanova is a massive undertaking. More than 1000 pages of small print on very thin paper. Difficult to hold, impossible to travel with, but some great excercise for those in need of arm work.The romantic conquests are nonstop (he seems to specialize in sisters) and it is sometimes difficult to believe this isn't retrospective wishful thinking on the part of an older Mr Casanova.The strength of the book is its wonderful look at 18th Century Italy, and other places, and its descriptions of both the well-appointed and Everyman. If you have some time on your hands, perhaps snow bound in a frozen cabin and needing either a jump-start on your sex life or a wish for a good look into a fanciful life that took place 300 years ago, this book is for you."
3,"Great history, but not classic Lenny Breau.","It's tough to be objective about a Lenny Breau release. As a die-hard fan, one is happy to have anything that features his distinctive playing, but this release has more historical than musical value. If you are interested in where Lenny came from, buy this novelty disc. But if you want the real deal, stick with his RCA (late sixties) and post-RCA work (especially his work on the Adelphi label). Having said that, Art-of-Life records does a great job packaging this stuff up, with ample liner notes and all the bells and whistles. One can only hope for another disc (or two or three!) wherein the music matches the packaging. Check out Art-of-Life's excellent 2-disc set of Lenny Breau's ""Living Room Tapes"" for more representative Breau."
5,Been eating this type of toast for 50 years!,"I grew up eating this type of snack toast. We called them rusks. It's a Scandinavian thing! Love Jacobsen's, especially the cinnamon toast!"
2,Nice Laptop - WORST Customer Service,I had one problem and I shipped this item 3 times (each of which took them 1 month) and they couldn't fix it. They didn't even change one part of the laptop. I am going to agree with others and say DO NOT BUY TOSHIBA laptop just because of their customer service.I would recommend someone who wants to buy a notebook computer to read a consumer digest or something like that and see the ratings on customer service/satisfaction. These are all electronic devices and all of them at one point will give you a problem. Good customer service becomes the dominant factor to choose where to shop from.
2,Kaplooey!,"Purchased from Best Buy online. Arrived with no adaptor. Used ""universal"" adaptor supposed to work with this model. Worked for about 2 1/2 minutes and then ""Kaplooey!"" End of computer. Efforts to obtain an adaptor specifically for this model fruitless. Yuch!!!"
4,Buy a serial adapter to usb cord too.,"I thought I was going to have to throw away my Garmin Rino 110 radio. For 1 Garmin discontinued the gps/two-way radio and getting the part through Garmin was $60. No way! I paid $100 for the thing all together. And #2 all but one of my computers had the exact connection needed to connect my radio to get updates. My only reason to give a 4 instead of 5 is that you will still need to buy a serial adapter to usb cord to fit today's computers NO computer today uses a serial adapter anymore,thank God we had a old desktop with that connection or we would of had to shell out another $30 to $40 bucks for that connection locally. So if you don't have a computer with a serial connection and have a 32 bit operating system ( Garmin Rep stated it must be) then buy one of those adapters as well on Amazon at the same time."
1,for looks only,disapointed It doesn't work with the rhino110 like they say it does it won't power charge nor link to the pc as promised sadley I feel it was a waste of money.
4,Good Cable,Cable works well. I have it connected to another 30 foot HDMI to get the cable box signal to my bedroom from the family room. I cannot see any loss of signal either video or audio.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the female end is not as tight as I would like it to be. I used a bit of electrical tape to secure the connection. This should remedies any concern.
5,Just read the first chapter,"I used to peruse through bookstores looking at the different translations of the Tao-te ching--specifically the first chapter. Wing-Tsit Chan just blows you away right off the bat. The other often-read translators don't even come close, IMO."
4,a beautiful book,"This book is beautiful in its layout, design, photos, but most of all in its message. It offers great tips on growing plants, and also on growing your soul. Judith Couchman is a gifted communicator and a great gardener, and a woman of strong faith. All of these gifts shine through in this wonderful book. I recommend it."
5,I actually thought it was good,"I wasn't that big of a White Lion fan when I bought this compilation. In fact, I decided to buy this and the Best of White Lion (1992) at the same time. The only song I had heard was ""Little Fighter"" before buying these.It turns out that ""Living On the Edge"" is my favorite White Lion song, which is on this compilation, and not on the other. I also like ""Wait"", ""Tell Me"", and ""Lights and Thunder"" (on other comp.) in addition to ""Little Fighter."" So I definitely am glad that I bought this compilation. I may decide to buy their other albums as well.."
1,AT&T should be ashamed of the 964,"Phones are an integral part of most businesses, specially service ones. This system is grossly misrepresented in their marketing. AT&T; has put out an embarassing piece of garbage for a leading phone company.People cannot leave you messages while you're on the phone. People cannot hear your messages because the quality of sound is either too low or too muzzled. Many features don't work well as advertised.We needed 4 phones. We returned them and purchased a Voice Logic Voice Pro 412 system. This little system is awesome and, best of all, it works.Whatever you buy, stay away from the 964!!!"
1,Do Not Buy,"The 964 is a bad phone system -- answering system is faint and unclear; after the TAD picks up a call and the caller hangs up, the phone continues to remain on for more than 3 minutes (Surprised I even bothered to wait that long.)unless handset taken off the hook; programming is lousy; buttons are too small. It is only useful as a single-line phone which is why the 1-star rating aptly applies. Do not buy this phone system."
2,Intercom doesn't work on my wiring,"One of the nice concepts of this phone was the idea of using it as an intercom. I have a huge house, and it's nice to be able to intercom someone in their room instead of going all the way over there each time.When I plug two of these phones directly into each other, the intercom works as advertised. But over my house wiring the intercom functions don't seem to work. It just sits there beeping at me like I did something wrong.Can't comment on the voice mail problems - I've never tried them."
3,"true, but without proof","This book is full of very true information about the dismal state of our food system. I know these things to be true because I have researched them for myself over the last few years. Though I am sure ms. Goodall has done much research, there is no proof in this book. She references a few books and studies vaguely but doesn't cite a single source. If this book makes you want to drive less, eat less packaged food or join a CSA, that's wonderful. If you want a book that uses research to support its claims I recommend Raj Patel's ""the value of nothing"" or Robert Kessler's ""the end of overeating"" and if you haven't read ""the omnivores dilemma,"" you must. I support what this book says and stands for, but its not very well written."
5,My heart is touched by this dirt road!,"This book is an excellent story in American history. It's rich in description and detail and pulls you into the world of this 11-yr.-old boy in central Louisiana during the 40s. The laughs, the sorrow, the warmth and realness of relationships will keep you enthralled throughout the story. Your heart will ache with Billy as he comes to realize that his immediate world around him is changing, and things will forever be different, hopefully, for the better. It shows how love transcends and blurs the lines separating black and white. This a great human interest story that will appeal to anyone. I think it should be in every library in this country and could see it as a strong screenplay. It's a great read for a long aiplane flight or a cozy evening in bed with a book. Loved it!"
4,"fantastic reference, very thorough","I'm an ESL teacher. I have students who ask me all kinds of grammar questions that I don't know the answers to. This is where I go to find them. The book is pretty dry (hey, its grammar) and technical, but that's what makes it such a good resource."
5,Another superb Buffy novel!,"I personally think it's great that Pocket Books is now publishing Buffy novels in hardcover, despite the price. Selecting Christopher Golden and Nancy Holder to lead the new batch of books was a great move again. Who else could possibly insert such life and accuracy into the characters of Buffy? Immortal was yet another classic Golden & Holder collaboration. It had the same innovative plot, a glance into the history of the villain(s) and other characters, deadly accurate characterisations, witty dialogue and subtle references to the show's episodes as well as other novels by the authors. A truly great novel, it certainly is a pity that Immortal will be the last Golden & Holder collaboration for awhile. At least they ended the partnership with a bang! I certainly look forward to their upcoming solo efforts, and I'm sure I am not alone in that."
1,Boring and filled with gratuitous violence...,This is the most boring Buffy book on the market and it is filled with gory and disgusting details that aren't necessary to the plotline. I wouldn't recommend this book to even the most diehard Buffy fans.
3,how do you clean it???,"I'd give it 5 stars if we can figure out how to clean the white board and chalk board. The kids love it, but after 3 hours play its a mess."
3,Good ones,Okay okay there are terrible songs on this album. But you can download only the good ones. If you like Avril previous album I recommend these songs:1. When you are gone2. Hot3. Innocence4. Keep holding onYou will not regret...all in all very very good songs...
2,Not quite the Best Damn Thing,"Well, I bought the clean version knowing that the songs I'd heard from it contained more crud than most of her CD's, but just because you can't hear her say the word, you know exactly what they cut out. There is less of the deep, reflective side that we can all relate to so well, and more of the man-hater side that only comes out when someone really does something dumb. So, if you just broke up with a jerk, this is the CD for you!"
2,Yawn,"From alternative to bubble gum in one move. I'm so glad I listened to this before I bought it, and recommend you do the same. She is a great artist, but this CD is awful. If you are very young, you may get a kick out of it. If you are a grown-up, buy her other ones instead."
4,"Good Songs, Too Many Bad Words","This is a good album. If it didn't have all of the bad words, however, I would have rated it 5 stars. She has good songs and good lyrics...just the words that make this 4 stars."
2,Step backwards,"Two steps forward (her first two cds), one step back (her latest cd). I was really looking forward to a 3rd cd by Avril, but I was bummed when I put this disk in my car stereo! This sounds like it should be her first debut cd as it is defintely taking a step backwards. Is she is trying to be more punk? Maybe, but it does not work. It is soooooo immature! We all know she is capable of much better. Her first two cds are still some of my favorite songs. Avril, if you are listening, we are looking forward to number four. Number 3 is a miss. You are still a hottie though!"
3,"not her best, but not bad","I have mixed feelings about The Best Damn Thing. It's a very listenable collection of songs...maybe too listenable. Avril's most recent effort leans a little more to Pop as opposed to the edge she had on Let Go and Under My Skin. Anyway, I can't fault a talented artist for trying something different. Despite some annoyingly silly lyrics The Best Damn Thing still has some excellent songs. With this balance I give TBDT 3 stars."
1,Mother of a 11yr old,My daughter and her friends have been liking Avril for some time but this new album chalk full foul language and horrible attitude is not going to be suitable for my daughter. The thing is the music is not even suitable for an adult becasue it's so imature and the lyrics have little to be desired. It's an all around bad pop album
1,it IS the best damn thing....,....to fling at a wall.brat pop/bubble rock rears its empty head again to the delight of teens worldwide.go go GRL POWER ( both hands with pointer and pinky fingers raging skyward ) !!!!!!!!
4,The many moods of AVRIL ! ~ its ALL GOOD!,"I've purchased other Avril cd's. This has many up-beat songs with many of the same sounding fast beat.I really like the 1st & 12th songs. She writes many of her own lyrics, it love the CD, & recommend it!Diane"
1,Awful,"This is derivative, unoriginal radio/MTV-TRL pop garbage. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do NOT refer to Avril Lavigne as having anything to do with punk; punk ethics or punk music. She is so far removed from even remotely sounding punk and even farther from having any of the DIY, rebellious, and anti-authority ethics that bands like the Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, Discharge or Black Flag helped established for the underground punk scene of today. Just because she's packaged by some major label to ""look"" rebellious by wearing a skull and crossbones or anarchy shirt (what would an anarachist even be doing on a major record label making music for MTV??) and carrying a skateboard does not make her anything. This is teenie-bopper music for 12 year olds. Call it what you want, just don't soil anything punk rock stands for by referring to Avril as being punk--she has never been."
1,A MAJOR Letdown!,"Avril`s first two cd`s Let Go and Under my Skin showed great talent and were easy to like. I was hoping for the same with her latset release but it was`nt to be.This [...] ain`t worth the material its recorded on. I was totally bummin when I realized I wasted my hard earned money on something that I will NEVER listen to again! I guess I will have to go back to her first two cd`s and hope that she gets over her""sell out"" phase before releasing another cd.If her next release is ANYTHING like this one,shes probably done for good! I now use this CD as a drink coaster! REALLY!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,"This cd is the exact thing as the other one that is shown, only the other one is cheaper. Get that one!!"
3,great,happy to hear the kid friendly version is being made! heard the original and its not ok for the 8 y/o crowd. does get repetitive after awhile.
1,Edited unless you buy the DVD version,"I had the same experience with opening the CD and THEN noticing it was edited, no labels in sight. A friend of mine bought the CD/DVD combo version and says the unedited CD is in that. Ummm... no. I'm not buying it twice."
3,It's fun but I hope the next one is better..,"...I like this album a lot-its a lot more fun than Under My Skin which I thought was dreadful-draggy vocals and mediocre. She definitely suffered from the sophomore slump. Avril's best is still her first-Let Go which had hit after hit! Each song was good on its own. BDT is fun, as is Girlfriend, I Can Do Better, Hot. I don't like how she sings When You're Gone-I feel like she sounds a bit sarcastic rather than pasionate. That could just be because of Avril's bratty image. I feel this album is girlie and fun and immature. I rather she stick with this style than go back to Under My Skin boredom style for the next album but who knows. I do feel that she can do better and yet I'm happy with what I have."
4,"Get her new CD from Amazon, not TARGET","I had to buy this CD twice. I went to Target and got the CD, along with another one. As I'm listening to the songs, some of the words were ""bleeped"" out. I'm extremely disappointed since I've never had a problem with Target in the past. However, they seem to be following Wal-Marts lead. So, I will always make sure I get my music from here or Best Buy, at least I am getting my money's worth.At least I was able to give the other CD to my step-daughter, now she can listen to it without all the bad words in.However, Avril did a great job, I love all her CD's, can't wait for the next one."
2,Back to basics?,"It is common place in music, for an artist to release a successful first album, then a more serious or experimental second album, and then after that flops, go back to basics. Avirl just fell into this category. What this ruffly translates to is that the second album was not the same success as the first, so she wanted to get back to what she did right the first time. The trouble is, she is a much more talented artist that this album, and we know it. While some will welcome the return to the bratty girl sound of Let Go, I'm disapointed. She showed on her second album some really good material and the change to really shine among the ton of girl bots out there. But instead she chickened out when the sales weren't quite up to par on her second album, and went ""back to basics."" While I like some songs on the album, overall it feels like a step back"
1,"Different style, but terrible album","I was so excited to buy this album, but when I got it and listened a few times I was very disppointed. I was hoping her next album was just as original as the first. Unfortunately, there's nothing that sticks out in this album. Every song sounds like the other. I really do like ""Keep Holding On"", but it's the only song I like at all. It's almost like she just wrote whatever songs she could fast enough to produce another album and please her fans. She's lost her edge."
2,slightly disappointing,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I was looking for interesting ways to use leftover yarn from my stash. There were a couple of nice patterns, but overall there wasn't much new or inspiring. There are plenty of scarf and shawl patterns available on the internet, and the ones in the book aren't too intriguing. This is definitely just a book to browse at the library or bookstore for ideas, but not a necessary addition to a collection."
2,Creative? I Don't Think So,"When I checked this book out at the library I was hoping for neat ideas for leftover yarn... as the title implies. However, what I got was how to knit scarves, socks, hats, and afghans. There's nothing creative to these patterns at all.. I already have these patterns. If you're looking for something new and funky, don't pick up this book."
3,lovable yet annoying,"OK, It doesn't matter if you brush the dog or not. It took me 10 Min to turn it on but after that it was very cute. there is an on and off switch near the battery compatment.(easy enough) but they do not tell you in the instructions that you must push the hidden sensor on the dog's back. so for ten min or so I thought mine was broke. It is a bit yappy but that is the point of it to get and hold your attention so you will keep petting it. The book says it could take several days before you get the dog to its happiest state. This is a verygood gift to give a child if you are unsure if they are ready for a real pet. or it would make a nice companion to a hospital or nurseing home patient. It is very lifelike in the things it does. It looks a lot like my dog Gerbil the lapso."
3,A bit disapointed,"When I was picking this up i thought that The songs might be cool, because the Daredevil soundtrack had some pretty good songs on it, this one didn't. The reason I'm disapointed is because I thought the same people that worked on Daredevils soundtrack would be working on this soundtack. I dont know if it was, but if it was then they really should of put some songs with energy in this soundtrack, only a few songs on this did have some energy. Because I'm sure the movie will have some energy. This is not a very fun soundtrack likes others, but it's worth a shot."
1,Expected more from a movie soundtrack,"i must say that after seeing the movie and enjoying it, and especially liking the music, i expected more from the songs on the soundtrack... i've never much been a fan of very many movie soundtracks that are nothing more than a random playlist of songs not in the movie at all... while i like ""wonder"", the song that plays over thebeginning of the credits, i must say i really didn't like any other song besides ""breathe no more"", which i already had on cd... so all in all, go watch the movie over and over, skip the soundtrack..."
5,"Great price, great picture!","I've had my philips big screen tv for about 2 mounths now, and I love it. I shopped around first to check prices and also picture quality and you can't beat the picture quality you get with this tv. If you don't want to spend alot of money and you want the quility of the higher priced tv's than this is the one for you. I promise you won't be disappointed. I have to say it was worth every penny. Thanks philips for making a great tv."
5,Shine the Light Deep into your Soul,"This audiobook will give you the tools of insight that you will need to shine the light of awareness deep into your psyche. By learning and mapping who you are you will then be able to make your life into the one you actually want to live. Her manner can be a little off-putting at first, but if you put your ego to one side before you listen, you will find yourself immersed in the magical world of archetypal energies and they will become so very apparent to you that you will be able find the most sought after treasure on earth: self-congruence."
1,Look to Sony for a smart buy,"Well, I have now bought 4 DVD players for separate locations about the house and by far, the Philips DVD621has been the biggest disappointment yet. Load time is frustratingly long, about 45 seconds to even recognize that a disc is in the drawer, then, you guessed it, more load time. The player does not offer any display for what chapter you are on and in more DVD plays than not, the movies begin skipping around an hour and a half in. I have also experienced ""freezes"" if a movie has been paused for more than about an hour. When I say ""freezes,"" I mean the entire player locks up (including the power button) and the only way to reclaim your DVD is to unplug the unit. Avoid at all cost and buy a fast, reliable and features aplenty Sony."
1,Manufacturing problems,"After reading the other reviews here, I was hesitant to buy this model, but it was advertised locally at an unbeatable price, so I took the plunge. Unfortunately, my gamble didn't pay off because the unit has the same problem described in another review. It gets half way through a disc and then freezes. This happened on both a rental disc and a brand new one. Once the unit froze, none of the controls worked, including the power button and the only way to turn off the machine was to unplug it. While some units may not be defective, clearly enough of them are that you should consider something else. Mine's going back to the store to be traded for another brand."
1,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!","I have purchased many Phillips/Magnavox products in the past and been pretty happy with everything until I purchased this DVD player. One word - JUNK.The problems:1. When I turn off the DVD player, 1/2 of the backlight continues to emit light.2. Half of the time when I put a DVD in, the player just sits there spinning the DVD and not playing it.3. Sometimes the DVD player will not open to allow me to remove the DVD!!! Even turning the player on & off doesn't solve the problem. I've had to use a flat head screwdriver to PRY the tray open!!I returned the 1st one due to these problems. The second one worked fine for a few months, but now is doing the same thing!I use the DVD player maybe once a week. I plan to trash this thing. No more Phillips for me."
2,It plays...DVDs!,"This player does not seem to hold up after much time. It has trouble reading some discs now and when it does takes a long time. Okay, so it's a Philips and it is complete garbage. With what's out there now that's cheaper and better, I give this one 2 stars.I have found this to be an good player for DVD's but not much else. A few things on some of these reviews are just not true for this player, and I have tested these formats and been successful:-Video CD (VCD): ONLY ON CD-RW'S- It does play, even has a light up icon that says ""VCD"", just doesn't play very well- will fail to load sometimes and may skip-DVD-R's: The ones I've tested work perfect every time, don't know about DVD-RW's yetSo, this is not the greatest of players ..."
5,Best SOng,Buy this CD if only to hear the song Broken Wingz. It is the best. It shows a different side to Twiztid. ICP forever with the Juggalos!!!
1,WTF they are actually ICP followers,Kids eat Acid this is neither Rap or good music. If you want some real rap go pick up Be by Common. Common is a great rapper
4,"Simple, but beautifully rendered",This is a touching story of a simple guy who thinks of himself as a loser but has much more going on than is first apparent. The characters in this book are ordinary working people but their bonds and dreams are respectfully and touchingly rendered. The writing is spare but it communicates depth and complexity.Enjoy this book. It may surprise you.
5,Great set of books.,"Bought these for my granddaughter. She loves to read. Its a great starter set for Nancy Drew. Its amazing, she is reading the same books I once read. Granddaughter loved the case they came in also. Great books for the price."
3,LOVED IT,"The reader, my granddaughter faound it as interesting as the readers did forty years ago. This is her first one."
3,Armoire,I am almost satifised with the piece. I too had a damaged hinge on the door which results in the door not closing properly. I have ordered a replacement part. Let's see if I get it on my first time around. It's a good looking piece and easy to assemble.
2,"Covers many topics but poorly written, and lots of errors","At first it may seem to be a good book, but after trying to read it and finding errors I wouldn't recommend it. There are better written books on CMOS SRAM out there."
5,A great compliment to any biodiversity unit,"Tarantula in My Purse offered a personal look at the many wondrous wild animals who have passed through the life of the George family. It gave students a glimpse of the respect and knowledge needed to properly care for a wild animal that will, ultimately, decide to what degree it will be ""domesticated."" The chapters are brief and to the point which facilitates the interest of young children while still teaching the many adaptations and often times humorous behaviors of wild animals. Thanks, Jean, for broadening our understanding of wild life and for letting so many students into your personal life."
4,Great kung fu flick with acrobatic fight scenes,In my opinion it has one of the best kung fu villians of all time(GHOSTFACE KILLER). It's a definate classic with decent fight scenes.
1,plastic arm pit supports didn't last a month,"The title says it all. I sit at a desk all day and do not consider that I abused them in any way. Within a month both plastic arm pit supports broke. No matter how I tried to tape them, it was futile to try to repair them."
4,Crutch Product,From Amazon Quick Purchase and helped from a knee condition. Did the job of moving around. Need to learn how to use them.
3,Portrait of a Marriage,I needed Portrait of a Marriage for my book club and by the time I received it theclub was on to another book!!!!
2,OK qulity,"This Keyboard Stickers was very hard to take it out,its ok , not the best, I had way beteer Keyboard Stickers beforeIts my first time to try this one , thats why its chep"
3,The separate books are better,I got this (and Addy's Story Collection) thinking it would be nice to have the six books in one volume for my daughter. After I got it I realized that five of the six historical lessons had been omitted from the collection. Since the historical lessons are part of the value of the books I was disappointed. I'll be selling both collections and buying the hardcover books individually.
3,Not as good as I thought,"I heard this playing while having a massage and really liked it. I purchased it but found when I as listening to it at home, I really found it uninspiring...."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was very excited to get this book, but was slightly disappointed upon reading it. I was hoping it would focus more on problems and solutions unique to lesbian parents. While it did touch on these subjects, it focused more on basic parenting skills. The ideas were very good, just a little broader than i had expected."
5,The Child in us all,"Let's face it, any child and any adult who's honest, loved the macabre and grotesque in reading and listening to fairy and folk tales while growing up. In the delicious discomfort of feeling scared and enchanted, made life a little more understandable as well as providing that ""suspension of disbelief"" that served to teach us the world is a far more enchanted place than authority figures and institutions would have us believe. And I do not think I'm alone in this perception, or fantasy and science fiction would not be as popular among adults as they are now. This collection by some of the world's foremost under/aboveground cartoonists transports you back to those ""Grimm"" days of childhood when something was alive and magic was afoot. This is too wonderful a collection for just kids. I hope the artists and editors will continue this series. Highly recommended."
3,Could have been better...,"They could have took all the good songs on this CD and on Bizaar and made an album that was at the same level as Amazing Jeckel Brothers, but instead they put out two average CD's. I guess their Juggalo Wresting is running them dry of money.Some songs hit the spot and really shine through to show what ICP is all about, but some of them seem to run together as duplicates of each other as far as beats, guitars, and vocal variety.Riddle Box and Great Milenko were two stepping stones to greatness, and Amazing Jeckel Brothers, though a small step back, also fed the Juggalo Army and helped to distinguish the band. Bizzar and Bizaar would have been a nice interlude to the Joker Card Saga if it had only been one CD."
1,It just makes me sad.,"It's painful to say unkind things about someone who I greatly admire. I think Lisa Haley has God-given prodigious talent! She is a musical force of nature on her other two albums, listening to which, I became a fan. I jumped on this album when it appeared, and desperately tried to like it.I'm not a fan of Christian pop. Not because of the message, but because the presentation of it is usually so dull and formulaic, and the music is usually poor. Unfortunately, all of this applies to this album. I think Lisa wrote, and may have produced this album. I love her talent too much to conjecture on the motivation as to why this album was produced.I found the music, Lisa's performance, the production and recording, and the instrumental accompaniment all poor. I don't question her faith, but the great gifts she was given deserve to be presented in their fullest. Lisa Haley is just much better Saturday evening than Sunday morning."
4,Awesome,This CD collection is for anyone who grew up on Andrae Crouch's music like I did. I had such a grand time listening to all my old time favorites. This colleciton really blessed me.
1,"Boring ,bad and not sexy.","It is very much lacking for this to be called a good movie.The main problem for this movie is the story. It is totally absent.Another thing is the acting performances. It is far below average grade. But the worst of all: I was bored.For after watching 20 minutes of the movie, I pressed the fast forward button on the remote control. I had seen enough.So do yourself a favor.Save your time and money on this film.I can assure you that there are better movies in this category that are worth a purchase.Try Gregory Dark`s ""Mirror Images 2"" with Shannon Whirry.It is so much more sexier than this rubbish movie."
3,"Poor quality, acceptable dictionary","I found this dictionary moderatly complete in its number and accuracy of german words. However, the quality of my book was unacceptable. The print was unclear and at times came off the pages onto my hands. After a translating excercise, my hands would be black from the poor quality ink. Also, the binding was not acceptable. After only one semester of normal use(even below normal use since i've found online translating servers), the pages began to fall out. Very poor manufacturing quality, yet average to above average for number and definitions of german words(that is if you can actually read the letters). I recommend Langenscheidt's as a company, just not this particular dictionary"
2,Cheezy and Annoying,"This video is very high in the cheezyness factor and all the rhyming has the word ""you see"" and ""me"" in them. Very annoying. My little boy likes to watch this to make fun of it :-)"
3,Good alchemy reference book but scientific context is bad.,"I see two areas for critiquing this book, the book objective and the science referenced. On the book objective, alchemy, I see this as an excellent reference book. On the science referenced, this book is poor at best. Love and lust exist in context with one another. A scientist studying love does not see ""a mystery"" but a tangible, understandable phenomenon. Like electricity, love is hard to explain; however scientists understand how it functions. Studying sex outside of the context of love seems fruitless, an error common to sex therapists."
3,Misleading title,"I haven't read the book but was attracted by the title only to find it totally misleading. Wagram 1809 was certainly not Napoleon's LAST victory. Perhaps 'Napoleon's Last GREAT victory' might have been a more accurate title: but after this battle Napoleon won at least half a dozen significant battles including Borodino and almost all the battles in the liberation of Germany except Leipzig, not to mention the campaign in the defence of France and the battles preceding Waterloo."
2,Mom flunked,I bought this for my 12 and 15 yr olds based on the positive reviews. Both kids think it stinks and can't believe I wasted my money!
3,good until I found out.,"I really like this searies and with the two DVD set you get the whole series, but would have killed them to leave the Japanese audio track on it? The english voice acting is enough to make you run from the room! So if you want the only english virson of this show, buy this set but if you want the japanese then go for the two."
3,Read a different version,"There's enough of The Count of Monte Cristo in this abridged version to hold your interest and make for a good read, but after reading this I feel cheated. The most evil of the conspirators, Baron Danglers, who is the primary author of Edmond Dantes misery, is given a relatively minor role in this version. All through the revenge chapters (which make up the majority of the story)I kept waiting to read how the baron would get his comeuppance, but was dispointed to find that's its left out and mentioned only in the end notes."
4,Nice watch but not for everyday wear,"I was very hesitant to order this watch given the fragility expressed by another owner. However, I found that it is nicely made and a good gift for any Narnia fan. Maybe the other one was a fluke or something. I certainly wouldn't ever just tear the strap off, and I was careful when I removed the watch from the pouch to look at the back. The chances of it catching on something and coming off or coming apart are too great-- it sticks out from my wrist quite a bit more than an average watch. It's delicate, and I can see it coming apart with daily wear, especially if you don't remain aware that you have a collectible on your wrist. The case is just as lovely as the watch, and looks really good displayed next to my miniature wardrobe replica. I wouldn't recommend this for daily wear, but rather for the collector and occasional use. Narnia enthusiasts who handle it with care will be very pleased with it."
3,Shipping problem,"I ordered the above machine from uncle joes & received a "" White"" with a slightly different serial number. It appeares to have the same features. Shipping was as promised, however, when dropped off by Fed Ex the box was damaged, resealed,& one side covered with oil. Examination showed no obvious damage,& with another bizzard only 2 days away,I accepted the machine with a caviot on the reciept. Further examination revealed it had been dumpted on its side,slightly bending the handle,& letting all the oil out. New oil & it seems to run OK. NO MORE UNCLE JOES OR FED EX FOR ME!!"
4,Learning to See,"Kurson's report of Mike May's journey from blindness to vision is important on many levels. Firstly, he describes the complicated process of teaching the visual cortex to see even though the eye may be clear. Secondly, he offers hope to blind and low vision patients. They are alerted to the fact that there are always new developments and procedures and should therefore always check with their ophthalmologist to see if their condition can be improved. Thirdly, it is a story of optimism and courage.Little mistakes, such as calling the conjunctiva the white of the eye, when the white is actually the sclera, don't impact the storyline.Dede Silverston"
3,Sometimes It was like Crawling Through This Book,"Michael May's story is very interesting but, the reader didn't have to know every detail about his life. Because this was a book for my book club, I forced myself to continue reading it. This book needed serious editing. The best parts were the scientific information and May's life after the surgery."
4,"Crashing Through: A True Story of Risk, Adventure, and the Man Who Dared to See",An interesting book that sheds light (no pun intended) on the way people see and don't see. An interesting read.
1,Junk!! Do not buy these gloves!!,These gloves are really poor quality. The inner lining makes them very difficult to put on or off especially when your hands are a little sweaty from hitting the bag.Don't waste your money!
5,Wait for the gong....it does work!,"I purchased the ocean track via mp3 download with some trepidation, as a few others mentioned they could not hear the gong. Then I thought - eh, it's .99, what do you have to lose (plus I couldn't really find anything else with a 1 minute timer that I liked). The first 3 minutes I did not hear anything except the ocean waves. At about minute 4 I heard a light gong - it sounds exactly like what you would imagine someone hitting a gong at the ocean would sound like :). Every minute thereafter, give or take a few seconds, the gong is clearly heard. It is not a loud sound, but enough to bring me back to where I want to be when changing poses. This was perfect for my yoga practice - as I sure got tired of counting to myself while holding poses."
1,essentially white noise for sleep,"The 'gong' noise is almost inaudible, I cranked both my media player and my computer to figure out where it was. The sound is so faint, that I had originally thought that my mic was on on my computer because essentially the 'gong' is just a small echoing sound that is so faint, I had to time the mp3s just so that I knew they were at an interval so that I would not that they were from the mp3 not my speaker system. I'd hate to put this on my ipod and have to crank up the volume, how relaxing would ocean be if it was the level of a typhoon in my ears? Don't buy this."
1,Sloppy and unorganized,"The book gives a narrow introduction on JavaScript for an intermediate programmer, so it is cutting corners. Many of them, nuf said!"
3,Dated But Still Fun,"OK, it has outdated graphics and some of the scenarios are not historical, but in terms of playability it is surpassed only by some of the subsequent PG games. A classic of the turn-based strategy genre.UNFORTUNATELY, I can't get it to run in Windows 7. It did run in Vista, however."
2,"Painstaking reading, even for big Costello fans.","They say anybody can write a book and Let Them All Talk is proof positive of that addage. This autobiography is a pastiche of interviews, press clippings and personal accounts. In short, it is painstaking reading.If you can say anything good about this book, at the least, it is a fairly comprehensive account of Costello's career. The only problem is that it is so loosely strung together it is like reading an unassembled jigsaw puzzle. Almost every single paragraph seems to switch gears midway through, leaving me wondering if parts of a second book been inserted piecemeal into the one I was reading.As a final note, Hinton shows extremely bad taste in criticizing the work of Tony Clayton-Lea, Krista Reese and David Gouldstone. I mean hey, let's leave that stuff on the playground.Only a Costello fan would buy this book and unfortunately, only a Costello fan COULD read this book."
