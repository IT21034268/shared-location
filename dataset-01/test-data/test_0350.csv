5,Greatest little saw on earth,"I bought this saw because I was visiting a friend, and she wanted new base in her bathrooms, and kitchen. Of course my tools were 800 miles away.This saw is amazing. It comes with it's own miter box, with a port that fits a standard vacume hose. Small and light weight enough to mount on a saw horse and carry easily from room to room, It cut perfect miters for the outside corners, and easily adjusted to just off 90 degrees for the coped joints in the inside corners. And the clincher is, one wing screw, a ten second blade change,and its off the little miter box ready to use as a flush trim saw for installing flooring.With this saw and the new Porter Cable battery powered brad gun, your ready to go."
2,Horrible...,"I think the other person who wrote a review must be friends with the author. This book was NOT good. The only reason I did not give the book one star is that the sex scenes were pretty good. Otherwise, the book was boring and poorly written."
3,THIS IS OKAY,"THIS MOVIE WAS INTERESTING.IT'S DIFFERENT.GORY.IN ONE SCENE-THE KILLER KILLS A COUPLE OF PEOPLE,AND HANGS THEM UP IH HIS ""HAUNTED HOUSE."" HE KILLS A COUPLE OF PEOPLE AND USES THEM AS MANNIQUINS IN HIS ""HAUNTED HOUSE."" THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH ELSE TO TELL.I WAS SURPRISED WHO THE KILLER WAS."
2,Nothing new,"I watched this movie knowing it was a slasher flick and it was part of the 'After Dark' collection. I have to say, I'm not really all that impressed with that collection.Penny Dreadful could stand alone. The Hamiltons was a very good new look at an old theme. Those two were the best of the group.This could very well be the worst.Nothing new. Acting was poor. The action didn't take place until late in the flick. With other great slasher movies out there like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Black Christmas and so many more, I was sorry to have wasted my time on this one.It's schlock. Pure and simple. Just another display from no new angle."
5,DARK RIDE!,DARK RIDE WAS SCARY!! I PERSONALLY ENJOYED THE SUSPENSE & TWIST AT THE END.!GREAT MOVIE!!
2,Dissapointed to say the least,"I kinda had high hopes for this one. Just cuz I was expecting a genuine good movie rather than a flick with a holographic cover I got at blockbuster for a few horror laughs. I mean, the freakin guy from the show 2gether is in it. Anyway, horrible acting and what pissed me off is the direct ripoff of HO1KC. Shes a hitchhiker, wearing about the same thing as Baby, and is talking crazy, and even says 'I love this song' and starts dancing. Anway, the plot has about one sentence 'get stuck in the ride and walk around never really searching for a way out' thats about an hour of the movie right there. Honestly nothing happens. GREAT gore though I must say. and cute little plot twist at the end. Don't buy this though, borrow from a friend"
4,Amazingly quick response time!,The seller sent this order right out and was amazed at how quickly I received this book. It arrived in excellent condition. Will use this seller again!
3,so far...,"I like the tape so far, but she takes a bit long to explain the concepts and I feel like saying 'get to the point, already'...but her information is interesting, and it was a subject I have been looking for more information on. I think though it is going to get better farther on."
1,For ROBERT TRUEX,"You mentioned that you are interested in other books on archetypes. I would recommend reading Carol Pearson, ""The Hero Within"" and her subsequent books. I loved the Hero Within and gained much from it.I gave this book ""one"" star because I haven't read it yet. Just responding to Robert's request. :)"
5,Great book!,Caroline Myss writes well and this book provides wonderful information on how to tap into your gifts and understand your life purpose better.
2,Sacred Contracts,"Disappointment describes my feeling about this book. The first four chapters are interesting for their historical and biblical context, but it was all downhill from there. The book lacked focus. The author restated religious and mythological ideas, presenting the ideas as something new and different. It wasn't. I bought this book after seeing the author on Oprah's show and now I wonder if anyone on staff had read the book before scheduling her appearance."
3,CD is incomplete!!!,"If you are thinking about getting Sacred Contracts, make sure that you buy it in the book form. I just got half way through the CD, 3 hours into it, when out of Caroline's mouth pop the words: ""I am now going to push you to buy the book because you need the book in order to read the list of archetypes to decide which ones fit you"". Had I known that the CD didn't have everything I needed then I would have just purchased the book.....now I will have the CD AND the book. What a hassle, not to mention that I was just getting ready to chart my archetypes and now I have to put out more money and wait for days while the book is enroute. There was nothing eluding to the fact that I would need extra material other than the CD or else I would have ordered differently. By the way, so far I really like the ""book"", but I gave it a rating of only 3 because of the way the CD is sold. Buyer beware!"
5,Amazing,"I couldn't believe how many lightbulbs popped on in my mind as I read just the first few chapters of this book. The author is masterful in her linkage of myths and psychology to spirituality and the individual quest for one's purpose in life. She weaves her own experiences with stories shared by others to illustrate their connection to the larger patterns at work our lives.I highly recommend this book to anyone who's looking for their path, trying to heal, or trying to make sense of change in their lives."
4,Spook-tactular,"You and your cousin gina are going to Tiki Island. The residents are afraid of the curse and people are disappearing in that island. But you don't care. You and Gina just snorkeled. Then, you and Gina find a cave and you also see a glowing thing. Should you follow Gina in the cave or go after that glowing thing?"
1,Don't buy this lemon,"This is the worst monitor I've bought.Right out of the box, the screen had a bluish tint at the left corner. It took some time but I finally got the thing to work right.Avoid your problems and this lemon. Buy CTX or anything else. But never again will I purchase a Viewsonic."
2,Dissapointing,"This is the only Wolverine album I own. I bought it after seeing them on Amazon constantly when browzing through metal and progressive metal genres. From what I have read, the first disk is heavier, the second lighter and this one a mix of the two. The other reviews on here are mostly 5 stars. I just don't get it. To me this is really bland sounding mellow music. The only thing that saves this at all is the very good vocalist. One reviewer compared them to Katatonia, Anathema and Novembre. These guys don't come close to the atmosphere or feeling of a Katatonia disk. They are not in Novembre's league at all. They may be like newer Anathema but to me that is not a good thing. Another reviewer said if you like Agalloch you would like these guys. I love Agalloch but not this disk. I know this may upset some people but I just don't get moved at all by this. I don't find it aggressive at all and very generic sounding. It seems like I have heard it all before."
5,Garden Rake,Ames True Temper Adjustable Lawn Groom Thatching Rake #1914000Good price for a good product
2,LIE a novel,"Nothing is more disappointing in a novel than finding it derivative. Unfortunately this is what LIE is and nothing more. If fiction is a horizon of expection, than LIE does little more than move our narrative hopes in concetric circles. You get the impression, reading Mr. Hollander's novel, that he is pasting together all the trite literary techniques that he was taught at Sarah Lawrence. Pastiche, when not in the hands of a virtuoso, is just pat repitition. Mr. Hollander is no virtuoso; LIE, no masterpiece of reiteration."
4,No One,"No one gets this book. Yea, it's lagging autisticly at certain points, but there's this weird sense I huv of being watched by something when I read it. Hollander, Kessler, whateva, seems to be keying in on to a part of our experience that we would rather do without. Now datz art!"
5,Wonderful product,I was having such a time trying to get the weed eating done before the batteries would run down. I purchased a third battery and still could not get the entire yard finished. Then i ordered this charger and it worked so fast and I could use it at the last minute to recharge the batteries and actually get the yard finished in one session.
1,Does not Charge all 18v Batteries,"I bought this charger, because it was the model number of charger to use printed on my battery. Like a few others have noticed, the battery will not slide into the charger. The battery has 4 terminals, including one that is an L shape. The charger only accepts 3 terminals. Black and Decker Customer Support has only recommended I buy this model of charged, despite my complaint that it does not fit. I now have a bricked drill that I cannot find replacement batteries or a charger for.I'm not sure why they have different products with the same model numbers, but the packaging claims it will work with ALL 18v slide style batteries. Buyer beware, it may or may not work for you."
4,B&D quick charger,This charger works great - charges within an hour - it does detect bad batteries with a rapid light flashing.Should have come with two color lights (red/green) because when put in a battery to charge it does flash and if you had not seen the rapid flash you might think your battery is bad. B&D; should have included this as its charger since its batteries last 20 - 60 minutes and it takes 60 minutes to recharge and with two batteries at least you can finish a project at one time - the charger included takes 8 hours and I'm sure this effects sales and when I tell others of this quick charger they are much happier but some do return their machine because they feel taken.
5,Great multi-voltage charger,"I'm now using this multi-voltage charger to charge the 12 volt batteries for my drill and the 18 volt batteries for my yard whip. When my 12 volt charger died, I found this 9 to 18 volt charger that really works. It's great!! It blinks while it's charging... goes solid when the battery is charged and really works quick (about an hour). The instructions say you can leave a battery on the charger indefinitely and that's OK too. Can't say enough about this device. I've even ordered a new battery for my 12 volt drill. One of my two won't take a charge. I was thinking of having to get a new drill, but now won't need to. Both the whip and the drill work just fine!!!!"
1,Misleading product description,"I bought this charger based on the product description that says it will work with all B&D 18V slide style batteries. This is not true. It does not work with the 18V slide style batteries that come with certain B&D tool sets such as the Black & Decker #BDC318R-2 3PC 18V Drill Combo Kit. B&D customer support confirmed this false claim. I have no idea what other B&D tools have batteries that it wil not charge, however it does work with the batteries that come with Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Electric 12-Inch Grass Hog String Trimmer/Edger #NST2018."
2,Does not match all B&D battery packs.,"Good product if your batteries match.However does not work with B&D; HPB18 Power Pack batterieswhich some of their power tools use.Check your batteries - if they have four metal prongs, oneof which is L-shaped, this will not work."
3,So-so I guess,"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this show. I was looking for something different, I guess to keep me occupied while I waited for Lipstick Jungle, season 3. Not like I had imagined. In all honesty, i was curious as to what a ""call girl"" is and what her lifestle is like. The actor, Bille P., is very hard to understand because of her dialect. Sometimes I have to turn on the subtitles to comprehend what she is saying. I wish her English was more understandable. The episodes are short. Wish show took place here in the U.S, not England. Don't really care what goes on in England. Overall I guess it's okay."
4,Absolutely Fantastic Series!,"Billie Piper (Doctor Who) is delightful to watch as she fills the shoes of a high class London prostitute. The show tells the story of a London prostitute with absolutely no shame in what she does. She enjoys it, she loves it and this is her life. Based on a true story.Take the fantastic and often hilarious sex scenes and fetishes out of the show and the storyline is still fantastic and the show is just great fun to watch!"
4,Excellent aspect of Americana,The man has been dead nearly 70 years. Some of his letters were publishedposthumously. This is an excellent relic of long faded Americana!
5,Excellent,Excellent reading for any seminar intro to CS. It could be outside reading. It is enjoyable.
3,Great if you like mad max remakes,"I do, so they were cool.If you dont like cheesy action surrounded by car chases, then this is not for you."
5,"Informative, candid, insightful.","In Finishing Touches, Lillian Hawthorne candidly reveals her own trials and triumphs as she passes through the phases and addresses the issues faced by the elderly in contemporary American society. These issues include the dynamics of sibling, parental, and grand-parental relationships; the dynamics of still being children to their own, even more elderly parents; and the inevitable limitations that aging brings. Highly recommended reading for men and women of advancing years, Finishing Touches is an all-encompassing, informative, candid, revelation on the realities of aging, written with an honest, first-hand perspective of how to deal with the ""demons and delights"" of aging."
1,A Worrying Lack of Ninjas,"Dear Microsoft Word Customers,As of late, this product has not been meeting customer expectations. The paper clip icon in the Microsoft Office programs is not adequately performing the duties that Microsoft has bestowed upon it. I feel that the paper clip has simply grown obnoxious, and most users - myself included - feel no deep personal connection to this figure. However, the gravity of this problem is nothing in comparison to the horrifying lack of any sort of a ninja icon in Microsoft Word. If Microsoft were to switch to a ninja icon instead of that foolish paper clip, not only would consumers be more excited about using Microsoft Office, we would also be more willing to take advice on grammar, formal writing, and spelling from this lovable, wise, rambunctious, well-endowed, and family-friendly character.Instead, we are reduced to taking grammar suggestions from a bouncy, awkwardly cheerful piece of aluminum. What a disgrace."
2,Yomogi & Red Bean Mochi Sampler,"The items arrived perfectly on time, however the Yomogi & Red Bean Mochi Sampler product was clearly past expiration date. The mochi were cracked and dry, they didn't have the correct gummy texture that mochi have and the taste, although not bad, was poor. The Japanese Green Tea Mochi, however, are perfectly fine, soft and plump.I believe a company that sells out these delicate items should check that they are in perfect conditions before selling the products, also because due to Amazon policy grocery items cannot be returned, even if defective as is apparent in this case."
4,My kids favorite,I am giving this a 4 star only because my grandmother's homemade recipe is better. This one is still a kids favorite & easy on mom.
1,Not a Keeper,"This HP Printer lasted less than a year. Constant problems with paper misfeeds, envelopes expecially. Finally, it stopped feeding paper at all.The cartridges for this nearly exceed the cost of the printer. It is not a quality product, and after various repeated HP failures, and lack of support I am avoiding anything they make from now on."
3,Not enough memory,"Don't choose this printer if you are going to be printing documents with a lot of pictures or graphics (choose HP1200) it just does not have enough memory to handle it and it would start giving you unfinished jobs, they even tell you on HP web site as a troubleshooting problem. It is just words go ahead is a good machine quality/speed/easy to install."
2,Beware,"This is a USB printer, and USB printers have *issues.* If all you print is text, all is well. However, if you print any kind of graphics, a USB printer requires that you change all PostScript from binary to ASCII and where you make that change is different from program to program. If you miss a binary file, the printer spits out page after page each with one line of gibberish. So, bottom line: If you are printing letters, great printer. If you print PostScript you will tear your hair out."
5,Everything I could have hoped for.,"This moniter is incredable. Huge spread in resolutions, can go all the way up to the incredible resolution of 2048X1536! Thats the equivelant of a photo from a 3.1 megapixel camera. Of course it only supports 60 herts refresh rate at that resolution, making it mostly uselss, but its still great to view photos from my digital camera on it. It will also disply 32 bit color on all resolutions, and at 1600X1200 its suppports 75 htz which looks great. All in all I am very impressed with the specs especially for the $$$$ I bought it at."
2,19 inch? Maybe I need a new tape mesurer...,"While mesuring the space on my desk compaired to the monitor I noticed something wrong. While the information on my order says 19 inch, and the box says 19 inch, this monitor is only 17 inch! And not even 17 viewable (the box and this site both say 18 inch viewable) - it's only 16 inches veiwable. Thinking maybe it was packed wrong, I just the the number on the modle itself - nope it's the same G90FB.I would love to know what kind of tape mesure they are using, because this is rather misleading."
1,Book,"This book arrived but it was very old, with yellowed pages and a musty smell. The pages seem delicate and about to fall out of the binding. Not one of the best books purchased."
1,"Local history, poorly writen",Interesting for locals or folks that might have family conections with some of the characters in the book. Overall poorly writen and quite a snoozer. Some interesting pictures. Could have been much more concise.
5,Very well done,This documentary was extremely successful in illustrating why the 3rd world hates America. I won't say anymore. If you don't understand then you never will so just forget it.
3,"Good documentary, but read the book","Restrepo is a good documentary of the war in Afghanistan as told/shown by two fine journalists. If I only watched the documentary, I would give this a 4 or 5 star review, but since I read the Sebastian Junger book first (War), I was disappointed in the character depth. Junger went into an amazing amount of detail on the soldiers in his book, and only touched the surface of this in the documentary. I know there is limited time to do so in this medium, but would have liked to have learned more about these fine men in a way that only video could capture.WAR"
5,Reality Check,"As Junger quotes in his book 'War' - ""We sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.""This film brings that truth to bear on our comforts and the less than appreciative way we pay attention to these warriors when they return home. They and their families should never want for anything ever again."
5,Best War Documentary Ever,"This movie is far and away the best war movie (and one of the best movies period) I have ever seen. Brace yourself for a raw, honest, compelling, emotional look at the battles (literal and figurative) that our US troops are facing in Afghanistan. If more images like those in this film were shown on the news each night, I truly think that Americans would think longer and harder before supporting any war. Regardless of your politics, you will (or should) love this movie. I have never seen a truer look at war than Restrepo. This should be the blueprint for a war documentary. An unbiased showing of the grueling everyday life for a wartime soldier, this movie will shake you to your core. I recommend this movie every chance I get. You will do the same after seeing it. A big THANK YOU to those responsible for getting this movie made."
4,Not the most exciting film but rather insightful,"This film is purely apolitical, it shows the soldiers fighting and they give their opinions on the enemy, why they are there, etc.. The film shows them in combat, including a helicopter attack that killed some civilians (previously I had no idea that a few infantrymen would use help support on just a few men in a village). It also shows footage of Afghanis, many of whom openly lie for the Taliban. In the end, if there is anything I learned from this film, it is why the war is almost impossible to win and why people on the news are asking ""are we losing in Afghanistan"" when the Taliban clearly has so many more casualties than the US does."
2,Interesting,It was hard to really comprehend because the viewer had to rely on the spoken word. Photos were very good.
2,Really?,"All I can say is that if several crazy Americans went to another country and terrorized it, then that country came over here to, basically, get revenge...and all of a sudden one night my house was being shot at or bombed.....and it seemed to be an ongoing event, I would definitely arm myself with the best weapons I could lay my hands on to DEFEND my family. If they broke into my house, yes they would find weapons. If they killed members of my family, or friends or neighbors who I knew were absolutely NOT terrorists, I would be extremely angry, hurt, violated in the worst way. And who do you think I would see as the ""bad guy""? I would have enough sense to know that ALL Americans are not terrorists. And any other government, group, or country that DID believe that would be at the very top of my kill list IF they pursued in rounding up innocent people, targeting just ANYONE from the skies, barging into innocent people's homes and leave me with no more than a frickin apology."
3,Your Tax Dollars at Work,"This film changed my mind about the war. I've always been anti-war, but I was pro-military until I saw this documentation of a group of little dudes whose nonsense is being paid for by you & me. They make the kids in A Clockwork Orange look normal. This is what Amerika has produced: Even more empty-headed, video-brained little dudes who are happy to hang out in a band of dudes doing dudely stuff. The disrespectful way these kids talked to Afghani men who were old enough to be their grandfathers or great-grandfathers was sickening.See this film to see how lame the military is, in word & deed. Oh, & BTW, this is [...] stuff compared to anything in the Nam fiasco. Dudeville has to make it appear really tough when it's a bunch of kids acting like a-holes."
3,good- not great,"n/t need 19b more words for review to submit, well i guess that about does it! Wait- no, there we go!"
3,It was OK. I saw a Nightline peice on this in 2007 so my opinion is biased.,Would recommend though. I was hoping to see the Nightline coverage as well added to the film which would of been really something.
4,A Good look into,How the lives of our soldiers live and operate in a war zone.A straight forward look without commentary trying to tell you if we should or shouldnt be there.Very much worth watching.
5,WOW! This one has everyword W/HOW to pronounce them !!!,"Nothing short of a saving grace when it has come for me to have to speak and be able to easily find not only the translation BUT also the pronunciation of them all -- you will be delighted -- it goes way beyond any other ""little pocket book"" I have used before. Finnish is hard enough (I've had years of proper lessons and STILL feel I'll never be fluent... this little book has helped me even help others!! Don't pass it up. Seriously!"
2,Kindle Version is near useless,"The book is adamant that using the (many and complex) worksheets on a regular basis is critical to recovery, but the worksheets cannot be printed or photocopied from Kindle, making a Kindle purchase of the book close to useless. Although professionals can order copies of the worksheets from Dr Burns directly, there is no option for non professionals to do so. Very disappointing."
4,Good,There is alot of helpful information in this book but also alot of written workbook type things to do. But if it helps then I guess it's worth the effort. When you have panic attacks anythings worth a shot!!
4,it is a comprehesive introduction,I find it very useful for a beginner to have an overview of radiation oncology field. It is also a very useful reference when you have questions.
5,Perfect for former jet-setters,"These are wonderful videos for any former jet-setter, now stuck at home with family. You can put on a DVD and remember that vacations won't always be visits with the family! It's a half hour vacation.They are also wonderful for meditators who don't have time to sit. Having these beautiful images and sounds in the background during the day makes any room an instant zen retreat. The videos even calm my twins down after a hectic day!"
3,Disappointing video quality,"This could have been a great DVD but nearly every scene is underexposed. The beach, waves, and near shore water is okay but could be brighter. And I guess that is the important part. But the surrounding hills are always black and without any detail. The sky, when it should be bright blue is a dull dark blue to gray. I have three other nature DVDs: Australian Outback; Bora Bora: a day in Paradise; and Soothing Waters: Ore and Cal. All have very good to excellant video quality. On the plus side, this video has excellant audio. The scenery is great -- what can be seen. The individual scenes are long enough to give a feeling of being there. And the between scene graphics are brief and unobtrusive. The sunset scenes are the best exposed. I'll watch this again and again, but with sadness at what it could have been."
4,Excellent Addition to Your Collection,"This is an excellent book for a good variety of quick breads. Some of the recipes are similar in name and style (chocolate chip muffins versus chocolate bit muffins), but they are all distinctly different (plain flour versus oat flour, etc.). I have tried several recipes and have had great success, with both the adults and small children in my household loving them. There are a few problems such as ""incomplete"" recipes (sprinkle topping on batter, but there is no mention of a topping anywhere in the recipe) and my copy had some missing pages and 50 repeat pages, but all in all, this is an excellent recipe book to add to your collection with distinctive recipes and easy-to-follow directions."
3,Date of print rip off !,"I try to always check copyright dates before I purchase any book. This one has a first Harper print date of 2010. But below that it says it was first printed in paper back in 1986 ! I had read this book years ago. It was a good book, but I resent the ''date of printing'' rip off and costing another $10 for a book that was old and a retread.It is too much trouble to try and get the refund as it costs about $5 for postage plus the hassle of going to the post office.I buy 20 to 30 books a year from Amazon."
1,What happened to the Sunbeam quality?,"When I purchased this mixer I was impressed that it ran so quietly. The beater design is good because it has no center for food to collect on. The disappointment came when I used it to make a batch of divinity fudge. It quit working, and when I took it apart to see what the problem was I found many plastic parts. The gears appeared to be plastic or nylon, not metal, and they were sheared. The whole inner design seemed very flimsy so I'm not surprised that it quit running. I wouldn't buy another."
5,At Your Own Risk,"Read SPIRITUAL GARDENING by Peg Streep at your own risk. After seeing an excerpt in Oprah's magazine, I purchased and read this exceptional book. It truly changed my life. I will never be the same. It took me outside, introduced me to the place of gardens in history, the value of gardens, the many kinds of gardens, and the love and care of gardens. It inspired me to read magazines on gardening, buy hundreds of dollars worth of gardening books--which I cherish, ""delve"" into the philosophy of feng shui, evaluate my backyard, enhance my backyard into a garden creation--perennials, benches, statues, chimes, birdfeeders, a gazing ball, and enjoyable dreams of more beauty to come therein. It's a passionate and fun obsesssion! SPIRITUAL GARDENING is my favorite gift to give to those I care about. The book is beautiful. It is full of color photographs of varied gardens. The writing is inspirational and full of memorable garden quotations. It's one of my most valued possessions!"
3,Good but there is a version that is better.,This is the best wheel out for Xbox but the Universal MC2 is the one you want to buy. I got error messages on this one saying my controller was disconnected. I have heard other ppl say the same thing. I think it had a problem with ps2 games also because of new game protocols or something. The universal version is also great if you have other consoles or if your friends do because you can take your wheel with you.
1,Horrible experience,"Tonight I bought this wheel and have been ATTEMPTING to play F1 2001 with it. However, I am having more trouble controlling the car than I do with the regular controller. The ""dead zone"" people have mentioned is very bad- I must constantly over correct- it is incredibly frustrating. I would just go with a Logitech or something else, this wheel is HORRIBLE."
2,WIERD!!!!!,"i rented it because it sounded ok and it was on my recomendations. I dont like the characters. The only one I liked was her husband because I found the wife to be a bossy flake, and as soon as I learend who the other chick was I stopped watching it because shes weird too.Idk maybe I'm weird but I cant watch a movie where the characters are already annoyign me in 20 minutes. Pluss it takes place in the 20's so its hard to relate to."
5,First class professional's insight,"This is an excellent book for most Toyota truck owners. Its goal is not replace shop repair manual. How many would enjoin to read a repair manual? In the sense of how to appreciate and take care your Toyota truck, this is the best one and very easy to read. It has made Toyota truck very comprehensible for a non-mechanic like me."
2,not as expected,"Having owned other Pulsar watches I was anxious to try this one. The band however was huge and could not be sized down.I tried several jewelers and not a one of them would touch a Pulsar watch. Most recently the watch stopped working, even after a batter replacement. Owned watch for under a year. On the low end of quality."
1,Got money to waste? Buy a viewsonic!,"I bought this monitor because it was a top of the line model. Worked great, for only 2 years. All of the sudden, the lights went out and nobody's home. Not my card, or a cable , the clunky thing had some kinda bulb blow b/c the green light is on with NO picture. Only 2 years old and not under warranty. Also tried to get some help from customer svc. They said it was under warranty, then it wasn't and then directed me to a phone number to call for an authdealer. Phone number was a phone tree to no where. So, will I buy a Viewsonic product again? Hello no..."
3,How to Edit on a PC,"This is a good cam for the price, great picture, OK not good or great sound. I went with the HVR-A1U for better sound control.For those needing a PC based solution to edit, Sony Vegas Movie Studio (Amazon sells it) which is the consumer version of Sony Vegas pro editor is a good choice. Version 6 was good with HDV and Version 7 is better. HD is a lot of data and a newer well configured PC is best for crunching all that data. If your computer meets the minimum hardware for Vegas Movie Studio but is still slow you can improve performance with a utility from VASST called Gearshift. I used Vegas Movie Studio 6 and upgraded to the full pro version Vegas 7."
5,Awesome,"This is my 4th camcorder and I just love it.I'm a big photo enthusiast, and despite I own a Nikon D70 Digital SLR camera, this summer on a 3 week trip to Europe (by train) I decided to travel light and left home my Nikon to use only my new Sony Camcorder: It's a great travel companion, light discrete and easy to use. Still photos are very acceptable. Video quality is simply breathtaking.I've done editing on my G5 iMac using iMovies HD and it works just fine. Edited video needs to be recorded back to tape to keep the HD format, but I hope that problem will be solved in a few months, when HD DVD-R drives becomes more affordable.In summary if you are looking for great video quality and performence, look no more. This is the best Camcorder you can get without going PRO.As additional advice: get a case and one additional battery since the one that comes with the camcorder is rather small and doesn't last enough."
4,The book by its cover,"If you are lucky, you will hear about this album as I did: NPR showcasing a new artist tackling a new take on old school R&B and Soul music with a voice well beyond her years and an achievement in the making. Don't be turned off by the 16 yr. old (yes, that's right) British girl who seems more destined for teeny bopper music until you hear her dazzling voice and realize that maybe, just maybe, we have our next Norah Jones type on our hands. Far too soon to tell if she'll make the headlines or stay on the path of quality over quantity but it be a rare feat nonetheless. With the support of superb musicians and top notch producers (and after all these months still at a bargain price) do not pass over this gem for we know not of what is to come hereafter."
3,Needs some work.....but could have a future,"Like the rest saw her on TV, found out the facts, and was like ok. She has a nice voice, just wish that she would have done some of her own material. To me that tells me you are serious about being an artist. Some of the songs I didn't feel her on like Arethea's and The Isley Brother's song, just not feeling the love. I think her next CD will show more talent and less screeching and better vocal control, she could really have a promising future in industry."
1,What a waste...save your money and listen to it on the radio,"If you really want to hear some soul...just listen to Peggy Scout-Adams. This lady has vocals and smoothness unlike Joss who sounds as if she is grunting while she's singing. I know Betty Wright and Angie Stone (these ladies can sang) helped Joss on the vocals. So you might not be hearing as much of Joss's voice as you hear of the other ladies. If you want to listen to real music instead of marketed ""white pop/black soul"" then pick up a Peggy Scout Adams, Betty Wright, Karyn White, Anita Baker (old school) or more up to date with Angie Stone, Beyonce, or even a Tamia CD and then tell me if Joss has vocals compared to these ladies I think not. Joss only get credit for being a white girl that sings soulful song hey this is what made Elvis Prestley famous.It's all a racket people not real talent...because Leela James and Joss Stone sound alike but are we hearing about Leela, I think not because she's not white."
3,Watch for her in a few years,"Bottom line, she has an amazing voice, however, the writing and quality of the CD are mediocre at best. On the technical side the CD itself and the production are terrible. She sounds all raspy, you can hear each breath she takes and a lot of background noise which takes away from the music and the song. Granted she's only 16 but she needs a new writing team and a few more years to come into her own."
5,Defense of Joss,"Take away the fact that Joss Stone is beautiful, young, white, and British. Take away the pre-release hype created by S-Curve Records and Shorefire Media. Take away the excellent coaches and musicians she has been fortunate to work with for the last two years and one INDISPUTABLE FACT remains: She is an amazingly talented and gifted singer. No comparisons need be made. Listen with your OWN ears and if you can't hear it, then you just don't know GENUINE and UNIQUE talent when you hear it."
1,BORING CD,"I have to say that I wasted my money on this CD. It was sooooo boring. I fell asleep listening to it TWICE. Maybe if you were a pot smoker you may enjoy this drab music, otherwise PASS ON IT. WOW, I am so disappointed."
3,hmmm,"A few rants about ppls reviews and stuff:1)SSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOO wat that she whyte and british and 16, yall ppls makin 2 big of a deal cuz of that....yall no if it was a blck 16 year old girl yall wouldnt take the tyme str8....and i go 2 da performing arts high skoo in NYC and iver herd girls betta den her who are younger 2 and write they own music...so yall need 2 chilll aiight2) what yall talkin about oohhh we havent herd sum1 wit that much soul or w/e in years....c'mon now pppl....hello ALICIA KeYs ...she's ten tymes better and she writes her own werds...and yea she older but alicia keys was 14 when she wrote some of the songs and joss aint write nutin yet...so down dawgiessslastly, yea the chik can sing and she got a phat voice but she aint all da special ppl...ya juss make a big deal cuz she wyte and british and 16....pfff"
3,good but...,"I admit she can sing yes but right now I just feel that it is predictable for all of a sudden putting out a girl like this. Its the whole I am so not britney. I cover up and I can carry a tune. Well thank God Joss Stone can. She is welcome in this music world with the [junk] we have now a days. She needs more promotion and then maybe just maybe I will take her more seriously. Part of me feels like she is just a white girl trying her darndest to should soulful but it ain't working. I know its not her fault for getting more recognition, she can sing and I am glad she is around in the music game."
5,A New Day Has Come,"A new day has come because Joss Stone has arrived with quite the vocal arsenal. This 16-year-old's voice is loaded with talent. This debut is a stunner. I've been waiting for a female singer to come along that I can really get psyched about, and it's finally happened. Joss is the real thing. You don't want to miss out on this terrific recording."
3,Nice start,"I have to say that I do believe Joss has a great career ahead of her. Her EP debut sparked a lot of controversy from die-hard soul fans who argue that if she was black, there would not have been the same frenzy that now surrounds the 16 year old Brit. Realistically, there probably wouldn't have but the fact remains that she does have a potent voice that has captured the hearts of thousands around the world and that is no mean feat. the covers on this set were interesting, but not truly inspired. I look forward to hearing Joss put her own claw-mark on original material, I think that will be the point where people will accept her on her own terms without question!"
5,Finally,"This album represents everything that is true and good about recorded music. It's all about talent. So often recorded music is more about the producer's talent than the artists'. Wisely, this album simply showcases Ms. Stone's vocal ability supported by an all-star cast of real musicians without interference from overzealous producers. Someday all record execs will realize that what record buyers desire is an artist that can blow your socks off - whether on an arena stage or sitting on a stool in an intimate venue. If you want real, pure, and moving music, buy this record. Way to go Joss. Finally."
2,White-Girl Soul,"Joss Stone is 16, and one of my unwritten rules is to go easy on kids. This British teen can sing, no question, and her voice is rich and husky. Her heart also seems in the right place; you have to admire someone willing to belt out little known 70's soul numbers. The problem, though: oversinging--the white soul singer's burden--plagues this CD through and through. It's never a good sign when the listener secretly wishes for one of the backup singers to hijack the whole project.For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"
5,I love this little book,"This is a great book to develop your power. The night following reading the book I have had a profound spiritual cleansing. I saw dragons and guides, snakes and experienced an incredibly real healing and cleansing. The material caused me to have that night a beautiful and unforgettable OBE during which I was taken to realms beyound reality. The excersised are useful, simple and powerfu. If for some of you this has not ""produced"" results - it has nothing to do with the book but rather with your levels to integrate this information and your readiness."
5,Love this watch!,I've wanted this watch with its sky display for ages... thought it wasn't made any more. It even has a date window! I'm tickled every time I look at it.
5,Cruise is my fairy godmother!,It was short and very sweet and sometimes we all need a quick enjoyable escape. Once again I am very happy with a cruise-y story.
3,Formulaic,Easily figured out from the start but Jennifer Crusie is so enjoyable anyway. A good vacation read out in the sun.
4,Love Jennifer Crusie,"Good story, I enjoyed listening to it on a trip to Missouri over Thanksgiving. Jennifer Crusie is a good writer."
5,Weight Watchers vegerarian cookbook,I like this book because it simple to use and give your the point value for the recipe. Has some great recipe to.
3,Reading with mild side effects,"I liked the book. It is about the old literary topos of the fountain of youth that turns out to be either illusion or the quicker way to death. Here those who take the drug will have to pay dearly for being young again. The idea of this magic plant is good. But the book never becomes a real thriller, because the pace is too slow, there are not enough surprising turns in the action and the ""climax"" at the end is not really breath-taking. We know how the book will end for every character at a very early stage of reading. The theme of a ruthless business man in a pharmaceutical company is not very new either(Robin Cook and others!). But the book is very convenient when you are enjoying yourself on a sunny beach, or, before you go to sleep. You will sleep tight!"
1,This book was misleading.,"Watch out! The cited research and the graphs were misleading. Look carefully at the numbers on the graphs and find out whether the graphs start at zero. Some of the results may appear to have large effects, but once you graph the results with a zero at the begining the big differences shrink to almost nothing. This book was a study in unethical use of graphs and misleading results to accompany them."
1,This book is not the leading Social Psyc book.,"Skynyrd had a great point. As an undergrad, I have never seen such unethical use of graphing in my life. I would not recommend this book. There was plenty of info, but ethics are ethics. This book violated those ethics and shame on the publisher for printing that."
2,AN OKAY BOOK,"Was expecting a lot more from this book. Yes its a touch and feel book but only had like 3-4 patterns when there is about shapes? My son and I read it and played with it but after we were done the first time he didnt care about it again. We have many touch and feel books and he loves them all, except this one. Very boring!"
2,"Suspenseful, but...","I'm not a big fan of contemporary fiction, but a positive TLS review lured me into reading this book. It was suspenseful and I finished it in two days. But one omission baffles me. How could the author have neglected the sense of smell? Not to give anything away...but Rupe, wouldn't the ladies each have had a particular scent? Back to Turgenev for me."
1,Another dull book about sex,"I read this book quickly -- it is short, and difficult to put down (in the same way that it is hard to look away from a car crash or imploding building). I think in part because you want to know what happens next -- or that something happens next, but nothing really happens and the book tries to pass itself off as a sort of rumination on the nature of sexual abuse. I think that's what its trying to do -- it isn't obvious that it is, but if it isn't, it's sort of a bigger waste of time than I had originally supposed. But it could well be. It would be a shame to pay for this book."
4,The Hardships of Immigrants,"This book was a very good book in that it showed the life of the German-Russian immigrant in the United States very well. The children of the immigrants have a hard time growing up in America, because the parents still want to live in the past. They want to do things the way that they were in the old country. This makes life very difficult for the main character. She has a difficult time because she can't do what she wants with her life because her father expects her to stay home and take care of the family.This book is a very good book with many details and symbols. Each section has its own meaning through its title, as each section is named for a different time of the harvest (of beats) season. I liked this book very well and would recommend it to others."
3,(three and half stars) slices of growing up,"Centered around a boy named Buddy growing up in the 70's in a middle class suburban town in New Jersey, ""Bad Haircut"" is probably a semi-autobiographical portrayal of memories that have stayed with Tom Perrotta, a very talented author indeed. The stories are often poignant, though most are open ended and don't have that ""aha!"" moment that short story writers often strive for. We learn quite a bit about Buddy and his family through these vignettes, which are only loosely connected. Don't expect, though, to be blown away, as you may have been with Perrotta's ""Little Children;"" but there's certainly something very enjoyable about this collection of subtle stories giving us slices of Buddy's childhood. For me, it ended all too quickly -- I would have liked to follow Buddy at least through college and perhaps through his early post-graduate days (as a struggling young writer, no doubt)."
3,Works...but go for the gel kind instead,"First, I'll say that while these products can be very uncomfortable at first, they do work to help straighten out crooked toes if used over time. Think of it like exercise. If you're having trouble with them, start out wearing them only a few minutes a day, and then try to increase the time you use them each day.I also advise that you invest in a gel pair even if they cost a little more. My first pair was the Genki-Kun foam pair. They lost their stiffness and shape within a few months of use and I had to replace them. The gel toe-stretchers are much more durable."
1,Great if you want to read chinese or english during the movie,The movie itself is great! Been looking for it for a while. But I did know know that I would have to read the script while watching the movie. No way to turn it off. Going to try and return it!
3,The Naughtiest Girl is a Moniter,"I was pleased when my purchase arrives ahead of time, and the product arrived in perfect condition. However: The edition which is depicted in the photograph is of an earlier edition than the book I recieved, so I was disappointed because I especially wanted a matched set (I have purchased the other two books already). For others who may be in my position, the edition I recieved was the 1989 edition, not the 1973 depicted."
5,Exceeds expectations,"As soon as I unpacked this bike I could tell that whoever packed it had an amazing attention to detail everything was done with care. It took me about hour to assemble, fill the tires, and adjust. I was only able to ride the bike for a short time however it is an incredible machine I was simply stunned by the craftsmanship and the quality. I will update this review once I get the chance to spend some quality time with it but as of now I have absolutely no regrets."
3,Great for the price,"I'm not an audiophile, but I really like the sound that these speakers put out. The bass is very good and I love having control of the volume & bass settings at my fingertips.The only complaint I have (and it is a big one) is that the length of the cables for the rear speakres make them almost unusable without AV extenders or splicing in speaker cables. Unless you are planning on putting your rear speakers right in front of you on your desk, buy the neccessary cables needed to extend the length."
4,Great soundtrack for a sublime movie,"Zeffirelli's ""Callas Forever"" is an intimate portrait of the final years of the world's greatest soprano with an interesting twist. Maria is coaxed out of her retirement to act in operamovies (Being dubbed with her old recordings). She even finishes an entire movie (Carmen) before she realizes that this is against all her principles and resists further offers plus she asks for the Carmen-Film to be destroyed. So how is this soundtrack? It's a lovely mix of arias from Madama Butterfly and Carmen (of course) plus some very new music. Bittersweet and haunting it's a recording I wouldn't want to be without."
1,Embarrasing,"I am Catholic and I found this book an embarrassment. The author is very conceited to believe that Protestants are wrong just because they don't agree with her on all articles of faith. She displays an audacity of the highest order. I'm sick and tired of conceited people on both sides trying to prove the other side wrong. It can't be done. You can't disprove faith. Both sides have flaws, but both are Christian religions whether the author likes it or not. To all Protestants who are confronted with this filth, I am heartily sorry. It makes me embarrassed to be a Christian."
5,"Leland 8-gram CO2 Cartridges, 10ct","Reasonably priced 8 gram CO2 cartridges for use in the ISI seltzer water maker.Works perfectly as spouse had her first carbonated flavored drink last evening. She said it tasted great. If you are old enough you might recall that you could get a drink called a ""Phosphate"" down at corner drug store counter. These cartridges allow you to make your own using the ISI seltzer maker."
5,Works Great,"The filter works great and has made a noticeable difference in the cars performance. That said it did lower the cars average mpg, but not much."
2,VX800 has problems with ATI video cards,"I recently purchased a Viewsonic VX800 LCD. The monitor itself is great. The probelm is that there is a compatibility issue with ATI video cards. If you have an ATI video card,the display has horizontal lines of snow and is unusable anytime you restart. I have called Viewsonic tech support and they acknowledge the problem but have no answers on a fix. Do not buy this product if you have an ATI video card."
1,Sandra Brown audio collection,"I love Sandra Brown's books, but I did not realize from the advertisement of the collection that it was audio tapes and not cds. That information would have been helpful in my decision to purchase since, I do not have a tape player anymore."
5,Your My Shining Star,"This is the best J-Pop cd i have ever listened to! Nami Tamaki's voice is beautiful and every song on this cd is great. My most favorite songs are Shining Star, Realise, Eternal Voice, and believe. Being only 16, she rose to fame in japan as a pop star. Who never thought she was so young."
4,nice,"I was impressed with the quality and strength of the sound with these, especially as it is only 2.1 channels. i have used many other computers with 2.1 and 4.1 surround, and these sounded better than many of those. the bass level is also very nice on these."
5,Great Sound - Great Price. Works perfectly with iPod,"I got these to use with my iPod at the office. My boss was trying to talk me into getting a Bose Sound Dock - but I got these instead. And I'm sure glad I did.I'm no audio expert, but I like my music, and I listen to it a lot, so I'm looking for a good crisp sound with a nice defined bass.For me the best test of speakers is if they can give you good fidelity and a genuine Bass feel at low volumes - and these speakers pass that with flying colors.Having said these, they pack plenty of punch if you crank them up. I keep the bass knob midway, and they sound just great. And they're such a great price I'm planing to get a couple more to keep around the house so I can plug in my iPod whereever I am."
3,"Works great, smells burnt.","I purchased one of these a year or so ago (from woot), and it seems to work fine, but has always had a odor of burning wires about it.It's out of warranty now -- and 3M has no interest in fixing or replacing it."
5,It works great depending on your needs,"This air purifier helped my husband with his asthma and his asthma attacks are more rear and far between. Also, it was able to get rid of the musty smell in our living room which gets unbearable in summer months. The filters are somewhat expensive but they catch so much dust despite the fact that I vacuum every week and we have no pets.But as I found out, the purifier helps me get a good night sleep only during the few days immediately after washing the bedding in hot water and steam mopping the floor. By the end of the week, my nose gets stuffed again.So, this purifier is great for asthma and mild dust allergies but when it comes to severe indoor allergies, it will have to be used in conjunction with everything else that the allergy websites recommend to be done to keep allergies under control."
5,Loved It!,The product arrived here fast and in perfect condition. Not to mention how wonderful it smells.
2,"Expensive, and sound quality doesn't warrant the purchase","I've had this product a while, and when my existing headsets wear out I'll be buying the aluminum version. There is no discernible quality improvements, and for triple the price it isn't worth it for the titanium housing. With daily use threaded in my Scottevest it's starting to have sound quality issues from frayed wires after about 16-20 months of use. Save your money"
4,Good Supplimentary Source of Facts,"The book itself is rather short and does not go into too much detail. However, it lists all major events in the founding of Ohio. Great as a supplimentary source of information."
1,Nah...,"First of all, it was expensive, second, there isn't anything in this book that isn't already easily accessible on the web.The tutorials did not go as smoothly as planned, even though I've been using PhotoShop for 4 years now. (Important) Steps seemed to be missing, and without them, you may as well not finish the tutorial.I've had this book for over a year, and to tell you the truth, the tutorials compiled in this book may very well be considered ""tacky and overused."" I suggest resourcing the web for the latest and greatest in special effects."
1,Indeed....Very Frustrating,"I originally found this book to be promising while browsing through it at the local bookstore. However, once I got it home and began to work on the tutorials, I quickly became thoroughly frustrated as key steps were left out and/or most of the initial work was already done for you. I can see where that might be of some help to some people, but for me, it was a disappointment. I am a relative new comer and I had envisioned a book through which I would learn by completing projects in their entirety.I don't mind too much that this book relied heavily on plug-ins and demo software, but it would have been nice to have, when applicable, provided companion tutorials where all the effects are accomplished using Photoshop alone.Bottom line: I wish there was a zero star rating as I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone."
3,Beware the Calories,"Based upon the 5 star rating, I ordered this book because I was looking for healthy recipes using vegetables. (I'm a serious veggie gardener and always have an abundance that needs to be used up.) However, after a quick perusal I realized that a goodly portion of the recipes use significant amounts of butter, cream, 1/2 and 1/2, etc. With my efforts to cook more lower-cholestrol and lower-fat recipes, I realized that many of these recipes would be ""off-limits"" and that I would be forever frustrated by reading great recipes that were not a good idea to feed my family on a regular basis. And in the introduction, Morash herself even admits that a lot of her recipes are once a week indulgences. So, sadly, I ended up sending the book back."
5,Works great.,I own high-end costume jewelry and these cloths polish the metals wonderfully. I will recommend this product and purchase it again.
4,The crookedest cops in Oakland,"This was a bad ass movie. It reminded me of THE SHIELD. The crookedest cops from Oakland are terrorizing citizens and criminals alike. Very good acting for a straight to video title and the story was pretty tight as well, it starts off with a bang as two of the bad guys rip off and murder some drug cookers. Then as they leave you hear in their radio that shots have been fired somewhere, they pick up the radio and surprise we find out that they are really cops as they say they are in the vicinity and investigate the murders they just caused! Crazy! Had some hot naked chicks too! THUMBS UP EBERT!"
5,Timex Easy Reader Watch,This was a gift and the person loves it because he can read it easily and the leather band doesn't irritate his wrist like a metal one during the hot weather.
1,not what I expected,"The grinder has insignificant power for good performance. It worked well for a first few times. After that it became very capricious, and we had to use again the manual grinder.Deni 3500 800-Watt Professional Grade Meat Grinder"
1,PLASTIC GEARS?!,"I too wanted a meat grinder very badly. Everyone in this city was sold out so I had to drive for 40 mins to find a store and buy one. The first time I used it, everything was fine--I made some rather nice bratwurst. However, the SECOND time I used it (grinding pork meat), the blade stopped spinning?! After opening up the motor we found that the internal gears had been stripped out and that they were plastic! Wow, plastic gears, what a suprise for a meat grinder. Well, I too am bummed as I really wanted a meat grinder--guess you get what you pay for huh? Hope this helps..."
2,not what I expected,I was disapointed in the performance of the grinder. It was very difficult to get it to take the food. I was attempting to grind vinison for sausage and it worked me way too hard. I ended up using the old hand grinder I had. It had to be force fed and was very slow. I returned it for a refund. - In my opinion it was not a good purchase.
1,not happy,"this grinder burned up the third time I used it, therefore I have nothing good to say about this one other than maybe I should have got new instead of used..."
5,A MUST-HAVE,"""Side Road to Paradise"" is one of the best New Orleans Blues/Rock CDs I own. Every song on the album is great. Buy it and you will not be the least bit disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"I have trouble sleeping so I purchased this eye cream to help eleviate the dark circles that I sometimes get. Like most of the other eye creams that I have tried this one gives the same result which is to irritate my eyes. The effects were worse than one of my allergy attacks with burning, itching and redness. I would not recommended this product for people with sensitive skin or eyes."
1,Didn't work for me at all !!!!!,"I followed the instructions to a ""T"". All to no avail. No reduction in dark areas under or towards the center of my eyes."
1,Complete Garbage,This vcr/dvd player ate my vhs tape after 3 months. It ate it and then got stuck inside the machine. I got it unstuck but it now no longer plays vhs tapes. Something broke when the machine ate the video. It is now just a dvd player. Dont waste your money.
1,"Tube crushed, tubes bent, small inner diameter","The tube came crushed with some tubes bent which is not too big of a deal, but noticed that the walls are thick even though it says thinwall and will have backpressure on your airpump due to high pressures from the inner smaller diameter. I've compared this to my other 3/16"" tubes and this has the smallest inner diameter and thickest walls which is not good for air use."
1,Away With the Vocals!,"Simply put, Air would be my favorite band if they did strictly instrumental albums. Unfortunately they've moved away from this. I can not listen to this album the whole way through; the songs with vocals make me cringe and skip to the next tracks. ""Alone in Kyoto,"" ""Alpha Beta Gaga,"" and ""Mike Mills"" are brilliant songs, but the rest of the album is ruined by cheesy lyrics, poorly sung, and distorted not to add any ethereal quality but to mask the limited vocal ability of the duo."
5,Pure Ambient Bliss,"I was poking around on Amazon, and noticed this CD, so I demoed it. It sounded really nice, so I purchased it at Sam Goody a few days later. The short, low-quality demo sure as heck didn't do justice to the full tracks, which are elegant, haunting, and beautiful.Of the ten songs on this CD, I liked most of them quite well. Near the end of the CD, I wasn't too fond of Another Day, Alpha Beta Gaga, or Biological, but the other songs (Venus, Run, Universal Traveller, Mike Mills, Surfing On A Rocket, and Alone In Kyoto) more than make up for those three mediocre songs.A great CD to listen to on a rainy afternoon, curled up with a nice novel."
3,ugh,"TBS is my favorite band, no matter what. Tell all your friends and where you want to be were amazing cds with amazing songs. Everything about TBS was perfect. I was really pumped for Louder Now and when I finally got it I was really dissapointed, yes their sound is different but thats not really the problem. The songs just didn't have that special something that the other two albums had. I do however very much enjoy ""ill let you live"", ""error operator"", ""whats it feel like to be a ghost"", and ""make damn sure""but songs liar (it takes one to know one) and twenty twenty surgeory are really annoying songs.Im still a big supporter of TBS and still love them, but this CD is not really all that special."
3,eh,"Around half of this CD is great material, and the other half is so bad it's not really worth buying the CD. You get the impression that Lazaar is trying to sound more sophisticated, but it has an opposite effect.To be honest, I don't think this band will be able to pick up without Nolan; this is their worst CD yet."
4,Louder Now: DVD Part One,This DVD has some awesome footage of shows including random stuff that happens on stage which can be hilarious. It also introduces the band and how they act with each other on tour which is cool. I already had the album but this was still worth the money for any TBS fan.
3,its good ... but a newleyweds lasik episode? c'mon,"is the 20 20 surgery song about getting lasik eye surgery? if it is then i must say i would rather have heard a story about boy meets girl - girls sleeps with all of boys friends - boy still wants to be with promiscious girl = GENERATION Y's FATAL DOWNFALL. lasik is cool cause it makes people see better but i don't think TBS should have ruined such a good song musically when all it makes me think about is jessica simpson's episode in newlyweds when she gets Val'd up and gets lasik ... whatever, just this reviewer's onion"
5,Student Study Guide for use with Sociology,This book was in great condition and arrived ontime by mail. I would buy from this seller and site again.
3,Not the complete soundtrack...and so expensive!,"As some of the other reviewers noted, this CD is not a complete soundtrack. And why are they charging so much on top of that? From memory I can list: More (Bobby Darin), For Your Love (Ed Townsend), The Israelites (Desmond Dekker), Freedom (Richie Havens), Purple Haze (Jimi Hendrix Experience), and Subterranean Homesick Blues (Bob Dylan). Some of you might want to burn a CD with these added as well. Anyway, they could have made a complete soundtrack for this fine film."
1,Thought I would like it even with knowing contents were uncomfortable,I read many reviews on a book before I purchase it. I now understand why when this book first came out people were up in arms about it. I was very uncomfortable reading the first chapter of this. I love all his books but this one definately not!! I should have trusted myself and just passed on this. A waste of money for me. Didn't even make it through the first chapter. Not for the faint of heart.
5,Five Stars,"In this book we travel to Kashyyyk where Lowie returns home to help his sister Sirrakuk Sirrakuk going through her Wookiee rite of passage. Sirra decides to prove herself by traveling the lowest levels of Kashyyyk to retrieve gossamer fibers. Naturally, Lowie's friends go with him. Meanwhile Zekk's still training at the Shadow Academy and must prove that he really is the darkest knight by raiding Kashyyyk's computer center. To prove to the Nightsister that Zekk is really a Dark Jedi he must elminiate Jaina, Jacen, Lowie and Tenel Ka. Can he really eliminate his friends? Another great installment. They really write such a wonderful story. I like how well they've written its everything you've come to love about Star Wars. Even Zekk you feel how he struggles with what he musted to stay at the Shadow Academy. This is the first home he has ever had and people having faith in him and see potential in him. Zekk doesn't want to lose that."
4,Good Stuff,"Very nice arrangements, but a bit too much electric bass for me. And the bass is too loud on some. I bought the cd for learning purposes, getting used to the songs, and it's real good for that. Not bad overall."
1,"17 months and ""The Blinking Lights of Death""","As the IT manager for a medium-sized business, I really like how solid these switches feel, but I won't be using them again. I used the switches in my home network, to help cut down on wiring back to the core switch. The Netgear GS108 failed after 17 months with the well documented ""Blinking Lights of Death"" malfunction, caused by failing capacitors. Unfortunately, I have several more that were purchased during the same time frame.I recommend against purchasing this make and model of switch."
2,Low Quality Power Supply,"Please pay attention to the postings concerning random disconnects.The issue is a poorly made power supply for this unit....likely more China crap.I have two of these network switches and they worked well for about about 2 years before giving out.When they do give out, its a slow and randomly annoying issue that you rather not have on your network.In any case, you can fix these issues by replacing the power supply with a better one.It needs a 12V 1 Amp power supply but I've found that any 12V seems to fix it fine as long as the amperage is at least 1 Amp."
2,Works fine; bad warranty service,"The unit works fine; I haven't ever had functional issues with it. It gets quite hot - be sure to use the rubber feet and don't pack them too tightly. (There is no fan.)HOWEVER, Netgear warranty service is now quite bad. One of these units (two years old) just died on me. We spent two hours being bounced from one person to another; our call got dropped three times(!); we will have to pay for shipping the dead unit in; and at the very, very end it turned out that they were out of stock for replacements AND WOULD NOT ISSUE AN RMA UNTIL THEY GOT IT BACK IN STOCK. In other words: just sit around, keep calling back; we can't even send in the dud until they are good and ready.I think next time, I'll try another vendor.If you do decide to buy this unit, consider buying two. You may not get a bad one replaced in a timely fashion."
1,Erratic behavior - not working,"I purchased an GS108 v2 in 2006 as a backup, and just installed it this week. I cannot get a connection on port 1, and the port 1 light flashes when nothing is plugged in! The other ports seemed to work at first, but other network devices were failing as long as the GS108 was on the LAN. Basically DOA, and now a year out of warranty. Not quite the level of reliability I've experienced with other Netgear products."
5,Good gear,Well just got these 2 switches and they worked right out of the box without a hitch. We will see if the reviews of these particular switches drop out after a while of use or not. I will certainly let everyone know if they do.
5,wonderful,"why,ohwhy, doesn't Joy C. write another book? I love novels about early Australia and this is a super read.Cute things happen between Joy and her lover, but I loved it. Try it, you'll like it."
2,Not quite Honest story of slave women,"I believe that this book is factually incorrect. White makes a strong statement that slave children were dying of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SID). She is unable to admit the possibility, desire and need of slave mothers to commit infanticide. For a high schooler or entry level college student, this book could give the wrong messages. While some of her facts are well taken, the ones that she concentrates on the most may very well be false. There is other material in this book that I think is just outright wrong considering that I have done substantial research on slavery. A reader can learn more about chattel slavery by studying slavery outside the US: slavery in Latin America and Brazil particularly. Historians outside the US have not turned slavery into a happy patchwork quilt."
3,It does work,"This product did not produce any relevant effect on me, it is very difficult to calculate if you are becoming more atractive because of your smell, but I can say that it has a concentrate formula that appears to bring good results."
5,THIS DRIVE R*O*C*K*S,"This drive is by far the best CDRW drive on the market as of May 2002. Why? Several reasons. 1-the drive has Burnproof technology which prevents those dreaded buffer-underruns (hence preventing making coasters of your CDs). 2-the drive has PowerREC II, which improves the quality if audio CDs that your burn. And the most important 3-the drive supports reading and burning of that ever-important sub-channel data, which is what allows you to make fully-functioning duplicate copies of copy-protected CDROMs. I've been using Plextor drives for years, and by far, hands down, bar-none this drive is the best CDRW on the market today."
5,Top of the line,"This is where the standard for audio splitting should be set, this is the Bentley, BMW, Rolls Royce of audio splitting, no loss in power from either system hooked up and it is more durable than and Abraham Tank, maybe not that durable but you get the point. I have 3 and hooked all three together and connected 4 speakers systems to my laptop, was quite the audio experience and noticed that individually no loss in power or quality. Great job with this one guys"
1,Not impressed,I usually think of Monster as a very high quality product however this is a major let down. I purchased this item to be used with the ipad and the sound is horrible. I have the monster beats headphones and this thing makes the sound terrible. I plugged the splitter in and thought there was something wrong with the ipad but then plugged my headphones directly into the ipad and the sound was great. I will be returning these.
1,Stopped working,Stopped working after 15 minutes of use on an airplane. Really disappointed in Monster with the lack of quality in this product.
2,What happened to truth in advertising?,"Reviews of this monitor are all over the map. Some rave about it, some are disapointed. I, unfortunately, am in the second camp. This is my third Viewsonic monitor and all before the P95f+b have been execellent monitors. This monitor, on the other hand, falls far short of its advertised capabilities. Sure, the monitor will scan at 1280x1024@100Hz but the smudgey text it produces at this rate is worthless to look at it. In fact, I have to back the refresh rate all the way down to 75Hz to get a decent picture without too many blurry spots, but there are some slightly blurry areas. At 75Hz its a decent monitor, but I *paid* for a monitor that could do 1600x1200@85Hz or more. And dont get me started about the quality of the 1600x1200 mode that is supposedly the optimum resolution mode for this monitor. What a joke!"
5,Good quality,A very comfortable fit and holds firmly to the shoulder with the spongey backing. Nicely finished and has a professional look. Highly recommend.
4,Good suspense from a new author,"Coons is an enjoyable book for horror/suspense fans. The character development is excellent and the scenario is all too real - this could actually happen, which makes it all the more frightening!"
5,Great Buy,"I bought this monitor for gaming and other graphics applications. It works great. Clear, crisp, vibrant picture and the gaming mode feature that increses the brightness in games. Great dot pitch and can handle virtually all resolutions. Great quality for a good price."
5,Wish I could give this more stars!,This is the most valuable book I own. I just wish I had discovered it earlier in my life; it would have saved me thousands of dollars on physical therapy. I've been a dancer & athelete all my life & can remember very few times when one body part or another was not hurting. Now I just pick up this book (always close by) and I can get quick (if not always instant) relief. Peggy Brill is my hero!
3,dissapointed,Tell her where your neck or back hurts and Peggy will tell you to relax and reduce your stress. Not as all inclusive as the title and cover imply. Not worth your time and money unless your pain is the result of repeitive stress in a non- ergonomical workplace.
2,It hurts my purse,"Sorry, this book is hardly worth the money I spent. Most things are common sense and what isn't is easily found on the internet. And there's nothing in it about what to do when your pride gets hurt after you've bought something you don't want or need."
2,Inexpensive starter throne,This throne is an OK starter throne.Save up and buy a better throne. I upgraded to the Roc-N-Soc Nitro tractor/saddle seat which is WAY more comfortable for extended playing. Other drummers prefer the Pork Pie round throne. You'll want to sit on both to find which style you like better.Pros:+ relatively inexpensive+ Good solid build qualityCons:- Uncomfortable for extended use
4,Good drum throne for the price,"I've had this for about 6 months now. I'm about 5ft 11"" and I don't have any issues with the adjustment. Minor quibble is the seat clamp is not well designed. So IF you lift the stool by the seat, it can come off. The seat is fairly comfortable. I like that the height can be adjusted and the legs fold which is convenient. But you would expect that. I bought it to play RB & GH games. It could be used for people who play an actual drum set. But then, you might want to consider a seat that is more comfortable. Not saying this is uncomfortable. But your butt will get a little sore after an extended period of play.The build quality of this throne is quite good. No complaints there. I would definitely recommend it over any of he cheaper stools that cost around 25-35 bucks."
5,Great ground beef,"I have really enjoyed this cookbook and the great diversity of meat recipes found in it. I especially enjoy all the goundmeat recipes since that has always been my protein standby in raising a family. I like the recipes for hamburgers, but also many other ground beef casserole recipes. I can hardly wait to try the terriyaki recipe as well as the curries and the greenbean casserole. This book will keep me cooking happily and healthily all winter."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this book through amazon.com mostly because of the great reviews and the many recipes it had for ground beef, our choice for easy cooking. Little did I know all 29 recipes would be different variations for burgers! It seemed most of the recipes in the book were just changing the spices, marinades or fillers that accompany the meat. I was looking for creative ideas, not just different tastes to the same old, same old. I really wanted more egg dishes as well. The book will give me some new dinners for a while; however, I will be searching for another cookbook to use."
2,If you really like pork rinds...,"Many of these recipes are very similar. She really, really likes to use pork rinds - an item that turned me off right away. Some hard to find items are called for, and she asks for specific brand names. I will give this book another try, since I have it, but it has been mouldering on my shelf for quite a while. Since this book is kind of pricey, I'd recommend you try some others first."
5,Great New Cookbook for Atkins Dieters,"The reason the Atkins Diet has worked for me is that I love meat. So I was very pleased to find ""Back to Protein,"" with a new assortment of recipes for main-course meats. (The reviewer who wanted more egg recipes in the book should have read the title before buying: it's ""The Low Carb/No Carb Meat Cookbook."")Lots of recipes for beef, pork, and poultry, and even recipes for less popular meats like lamb and game, plus some seafood recipes as well. The only gripe I have is that the recipes do not include actual carb counts, only a classification of low, very low, trace or no carbohydrates. Those who have to be extremely precise in their carb-counting will need to figure out actual counts on their own.Other than that, the book is tremendous, as variety is something we all seek in our low-carb way of eating."
5,leap frog,Daughter couldn't understand what this toy was saying at times but she loved the music that it played.
4,Great toy!,"My 15 month old daughter loves this radio. Even though she doesn't go in the kitchen, and doesn't put it on the fridge, she has lots of fun with it. It is great for learning as well as entertaining."
2,Very disappointed!,"I was really excited to get this toy for my 21 months old son who's crazy about the alphabets these days. BUT I was so let down by this radio as it does nothing but play music and songs. At this price point you'd expect more than just a music box. It doesn't even announce the letters slowly (so my child can learn). The recordings of standard abc songs also go very differently (melodically) than what we are used to, so my son is very confused when he tries to sing along. The song recordings and the flashing LED screen also are both too fast for a 21 months old, even though the box says it's suitable for 12 months +. My son gets bored with it within 2 minutes.I'll be returning this."
5,Love it!,"My granddaughter loves this. She is only 9 months old, so I can only imagine how much she will learn the older she gets. Would definitely recommend."
1,The Music Is Too Short,"My son, 10 months old, likes to put on music and dance with me. He normally presses the button on his musical toys and runs to me for a dance. This toy disappointed him because the music won't last for more than 5 seconds after the button is pressed.This is not a good toy for baby who enjoys music."
2,does not stay on the fridge!,"I loved the idea of having something on the fridge to occupy my little one when I'm in the kitchen. He loves to stay in the kitchen and very interested in things on the fridge. However, this toy did NOT stay on the fridge so it killed the purpose. It seems that the magnets are not strong enough to carry its weight. In addition, my son likes to interact with toys. This one did not offer much because there is only one button that activates the music which makes it pretty boring for my son. The lights are fun to watch because they light up according to music, which I liked. But again, there is not much to engage little ones except for sitting in front of it and watching how lights changes to the music. My son is 11 month-old. For older boys it might be different. I would recommend visiting a store nearby and let your baby (and yourself) play with it to see if she/he would be interested in it. I returned it..."
4,Nice toy.,"My 18-month old grandson loved carrying it around, pushing the buttons, watching and listening. A good purchase."
4,My Son really loves this toy,My 11 month old son loves this toy he is really into music and loves dancing to it. the only thing i dont like is there are not that many songs so you end up getting them stuck in your head. But my son really love it so I sacrifice. Overall it is what I expected it would be.
2,Doesn't stay on fridge!,"The toy is too heavy to stay on the fridge and immediately slides to the floor everytime I put it on. I have a normal fridge, so I don't know why this product doesn't stay on, maybe the magnets aren't strong enough or the toy itself is too heavy. My 2 1/2 year old and 6 year old pick it up sometimes but it gets tossed into the toybox and doesn't get played with often."
4,Great value!,"Works will all my components from a variety of vendors. Only weakness is lack of support for some of the higher end features on both my TV and cable box. If I want to switch from wide screen to normal, I have to reach for the TV remote."
1,piece of junk,"I ordered this to wrap the battery of my Dodge truck and for my ATV. It worked only when I tested it inside my house to see how warm this wrap gets. The first night, it failed. It wasn't even the slightest bit warm the next morning. Don't waste your money with this product. Amazon gave full refund and shipping."
4,Very Helpful.....,I recently bought this DVD and found it very helpfulI'd recommend this for anyone who wants to improve their kicks!
1,Ruined my faucet,"I bought a Pur filter several months ago. It worked fine, we had filtered water, blah blah blah. But very quickly we noticed that the faucet handle was becoming hard to move, like it was sticky (perhaps water was backing up?). We removed the Pur filter withing a month of putting it on because of this. Our faucet has never recovered, and we will have to get a new one because of the Pur filter."
2,try epoxy glue to hold faucet,"In two weeks, the flimsy little black plastic connector to the faucet broke off and the PUR device crashed into our sink. PUR replaced the connector, but this time I used epoxy glue on the threads to hold the plastic connector to the spigot. Be sure to let it dry for 24 hours without using the sink. It's been a couple of months and the connector hasn't broken again, but I would have some spare connectors on hand, especially if you ever get a new faucet. You can still remove the device but the black plastic connector will be glued."
4,I like it. Good price for better tasting water.,"I like this product, but will probably stick with my Britta pitcher for day to day use. I like the faucet for water which we don't want chilled in the fridge through our Britta, for dog water, and for daily use water when cooking / etc. I also find it helps take out some of the taste in the water coming out of the faucet, which is definitely nice. I dn't yet know how long the filter will last, and am a little apprehensive about it -- I'm worried we'll go through them all the time, but that concern might be unfounded. Time will tell. I also really like the feature that you can switch between filtered and non-filtered water, which impacts the speed of the flow of water from the faucet. I think for the price, this is a good buy and worth a try. I'm glad I did."
2,"Water tastes fine, but mount is terrible","I gave it two stars because the filter works, but the mount is terrible - it wasn't designed for the water to flow properly. No matter what angle we put it at, the filtered water flows out so slowly it runs down the faucet mount towards the back of the sink. The flow comes out at barely a trickly after only a few weeks. The light still flashes green, but it literally takes 20+ minutes to fill up one gallon.I will never buy this again. If we hadn't moved to an area with no costco, I would return it immediately."
2,This is not stainless steel; it's plastic.,"I purchased this item to replace my stainless steel one that started leaking after 6 months. My husband ordered this because it says stainless steel, but it is really plastic made to sort of look like stainless steel. The one click attachment is nice, and it hasn't leaked yet. But I'm giving it 2 stars because it is plastic when we thought we were getting stainless steel."
1,Faucet connected filter pops off after short time of use.,"Faucet connected filter pops off after short time of use. The culprit is the cheap plastic connector, probably made in China, that has the threads quickly stripped from water pressure and vibration. Use of a brass connector would solve the problem, but that might cost two cents more to make.Don't buy the cheap piece of ****."
1,"i wish all it did was leak, i'd take that now","we have been buying pur filters for years and years and have loved the taste of the water. something about these new one click mounts are horrible. they build up pressure in them or something and the filter blows off the faucet and scares me to death! at first it would do it with just the filter side on, lately its been doing it just using the tap water side. i would gladly go back to the leaks. those were bad but at least they didn't scare me. i've tried changing adapters and no luck. i would switch to another brand but i just bought a box of 6 filter refills. pur is nice enough to send you a coupon for a free unit if you are having problems, so i am trying this one and hoping it is the teeniest bit better. but i have a feeling until they change the way its made its not gonna work right. pur please hire someone to help you make a good reliable safe water filter mount! we love your water! thanks for listening."
5,Easy to use,I ordered this faucet filter to replace an older model. I liked the new design more because it was smaller and moveable. It can even be easily taken off to make more room in your sink and then clicks back on. It tells you when the filter needs to be replaced so there is no guessing. I wish that hot water could be used for this but I understand the limitations.
2,"Great Water, Terrible Reliability","We love how clean our water tastes through the 3 stage filter, however in the last six months I have had to replace the entire system. The plastic housing continues to crack at the threading from an inability to deal with normal water pressure. Unfortunately I will no longer be able to use this product."
1,Worst I have had,"Bought to replace Instapure filter. Not happy. Did not last 1/2 as long. Flow slows to a trickle within a month. Also extremely hard to open to replace cartridge, Used up 4 cartridges in 4 months. Returning to Instapure when final one expires (i.e. flow becomes drip. PUR obviously makes its profits on replacement cartridges."
2,I'd pay a couple dollars more for decent hardware,"Yeah, this newer model PUR filter looks nice, but it leaks like nobody's business. I'd be willing to pay a slightly higher price for a higher quality fitting and proper seals."
1,Terrible build quality,"This water filter was on our wedding registry, but my wife and I both wish we had gotten something else. The unit was difficult to install on our faucet using the included adapters, but I was finally able to get it mounted leak-free after a trip to the hardware store. The unit performed admirably for about 2 months before it started leaking every time you operated the faucet, regardless of whether you were using the filter mechanism. The leak is so bad that it soaks your hand if you hold a glass under the stream of water. The leak stems from the filter housing, not from where the housing connects to the faucet. Unfortunately, I bought extra filters for the thing before it started leaking so now I'm stuck with the POS. I would love to write a letter of complaint to the company, but their website is on par with the products they manufacture and thus they have no link to submit complaints. Don't buy this product."
1,a poor replacement,A real piece of garbage compaired.to older model I wanted to replace it with thisis the only drawback to online buying online.
2,Good filtering but junk,"I went through 4 or 5 different PUR faucet mount filters over several years - in various different configurations. Invariably, the filters clogged long before they had filtered their rated capacity of water, and the mounts cracked in less than a year - often less than 6 months. The filters are difficult to change because the caps on the mount get jammed. The water quality was very good, but the product is truly junk.I switched to Brita faucet mount and have been happy with the same one for almost 3 years now. Water quality is 1/2 notch below PUR, but much better made and easier to change.The best I ever used was the PUR sink mount filters which lasted the longest but they stopped making those years ago unfortunately.Haven't tried Culligan but from the reviews they also have big quality problems."
3,An OK filter...,"I've had two of these now. A few thoughts:- It is convienent and easy to use.- None of the provided adapters fit my new (1 year old) faucet. I had to do lots of looking in hardware stores to find an adapter.- The filter housing is made of PLASTIC, contrary to what the description says. These are chrome colored plastic, NOT stainless steel.- Consequently, my first one leaked fairly soon after I got it. It's not made very tough, in my view. And given it's size and location over the sink, it's easy to knock it when rinsing pots and pans.- I find the flow through the filter is very dependent on the water pressure coming from the tap. I notice that my building water pressure fluctuates significantly, and my flow through the filter correspondingly changes. That said, the flow through the filter is never anything near what the tap puts out."
1,GARBAGE!! DO NOT BUY!,SAVE YOUR SELF TIME AND MONEY!When we first purchased this product we were thrilled.... although too bad it's made entirely of plastic... after about 6 months of movement on the faucet it stripped the (again plastic) adapter for your faucet and then repeatedly fell into the sink over and over again. cracking a little bit more every time. I called to get a replacement adapter for the faucet which was sent but only lasted for another 2 months. the adapter is soft plastic and the sink head (as is everyone's) is made from metal... hence when metal twists over and over around soft plastic is strips it and eventually cuts right through it and destroys it. like a knife cutting slowly over time.SAVE YOUR SELF THE HEADACHES DO NOT BUY THIS. DO NOT BUY...I suppose the best thing is when I throw it out I can recycle it... because it's plastic.
1,Cheap hardware. The whole filter system falls off into the sink,"It worked OK for a while, but the cheap plastic connector wears out and there is no way to get a replacement. Don't waste your money on this product."
2,"Water tastes good, but...","I've probably owned a dozen various model PUR 3-stage filters over the past few years. Each one leaked in different and often dramatic ways. I keep using them cuz P&G; replaces them no questions asked even if you still don't have the box. (I save it now anticipating the device will eventually become defective).Afer installing the latest one - the chrome faucet-mounted 9400B - I thought they had finally gotten it right. It was easy to install and appeared pretty solid. Unfortunately, it started falling off the faucet after about a month because the cheap threads adapter couldn't handle the weight. If they could just improve that one component (maybe provide a metal one instead of plastic?) I would give a 5-star endorsement."
2,Ages quickly -,"In 5 months and two filters, every joint that could leak on this filter does. If was fine for 3 months, then water started leaking everywhere it could. I tightened where I could and made sure all parts were in place, but the internal o-rings just died. I paid $45 for this locally - it should last a lot longer than that. Going to try the Pur warranty department and see what they will do for me.As far as water quality - pretty good. If it didn't leak like a sieve now, I likely would have given this a 4-star rating."
1,This item sucks,"I like the taste of the filtered water but this filter leaked after a couple of months and was unusable after not even one year. Since I still have several cartridges left, I will purchase a new one - for sure the last one of this brand. Not very sustainable. I cannot see why it is that hard to produce good quality material - it exists for the European market - there, this ""quality"" does not survive!"
1,PUR Water Filter,"Purchased the unit and it leaked, leaked, leaked. Replaced unit and new PUR unit leaked, leaked, leaked even with teflon plumbing tape. This unit is junk, junk, junk!"
1,"Good filter, terrible hardware- Rip Off Customer Service","I purchased the horizontal chrome PUR filter 4 weeks ago. Foolishly, they made the CHEAP faucet adapter out of plastic and it completely failed after 2 weeks- causing the entire filter to crash into my sink, cracking the filter housing. I called PUR today and they refused to replace the entire unit- only the weak plastic adapter with a ""Newer"" model made from metal and plastic...Geee. Ya Think they should have made the adapter from metal to begin with?? Never purchase from PUR"
1,Unfortunately I can't give this thing 0 stars,"I bought this a year ago and recently purchased a TDS water meter. Basically the water meter measures how much dissolved solids are in the water. To my surprise, the meter read about 220 ppm for both tap and filtered water. I then cracked open a bottle of water from the fridge to see if the meter was working and found it read a mere 10 ppm. My surprise quickly became anger as it now dawned on me that I have been drinking from this thing for the past YEAR all the while it was basically tap. Now 220 ppm in tap isn't that bad as I have heard other people get 300+ or even 400+ readings on their tap...those poor souls. But still, I expected this thing to do something. Maybe I was wrong to expect a water filter to actually filter stuff out rather than just look cool. I guess that deserves 1 star. It looks pretty cool, but as far as functionality goes I am disappointed."
1,Pur snap on filter,"Do not buy this product. The plastic - yes plastic - adapter that screws on to the faucet and is expected to hold the weight of a filter full of water starts to unscrew itself after a few months as you swing the filter back & forth. Then the water squirts out. I have emailed Proctor & Gamble for assistance, but no answer yet.Get something else."
1,Pur garbage...,"Bought one. Leaked like crazy from the outset. Perhaps we got a lemon? Bought another. Guess what? Leaked like crazy from the outset. We followed all the instructions, but as soon as the water was turned on, streams of water came shooting from the faucet/filter interface. DON'T BUY THIS THING! It's Pur garbage... (although I must admit the trickle of water coming from the filter WAS filtered nicely and tasted great. Unfortunately the delivery mechanism was very cheaply constructed and made it useless)."
3,Not necessarily the greatest,"I had higher hopes for this product than were warranted. When I received it and took a look, it seemed far flimsier than I'd anticipated, so I'm not sure that it's going to even last a year--and if not, there will be no need for purchasing new filters. While it installed easily enough, I don't feel confident that it will stay in place for the long haul. I'm going to reserve judgment for the time being and give it a few months to prove itself. I will revisit this review at the start of the new year."
2,"Worked great, then leaks","I loved this product at first, but after less than a year, it started leaking at the connections and now sprays upward. The only way we can use it now is to lift up on it slightly while using it - a real pain. I won't buy another."
2,Leaking problem,Length:: 0:41 MinsI have owned this faucet mount for about a year. It starts leaking couple weeks ago. I don't see any broken part inside or outside. It just leaks everywhere. This is the second one I bought from COSTCO. Both of them have the same leaking problem.
2,Makes water taste good but can leave a bad taste after a few weeks,"I've been through 3 of these now and I think I'm going to give up, all three leaked. PUR sent me a coupon to replaced the first one and after the second one broke, I never heard from them again. It's really a bad design and I'm sure PUR has received enough complaints about it to make design changes. I have 2 boxes of replace replacement filters but I don't know if I want to buy another so it can leak. The water tastes good so it's just gets 2 stars."
4,Much Needed,"For a used item, I was very happy in its condition upon arrival.The very next morning I was trying to get my 2year old son to do stretches with me, and only had to stop a few times to rest. Seeing as its been quite some time (and weight!) since I've been able to get back into my passion I was very happy with the suplimental stretching and exercises.If you're trying to help strengthen your arms and shoulders, this is definately something to look in to purchasing."
4,Naruto Shippuden: set ten,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view.
4,Overall Good,"Pros: Protects very well; scroll wheel protected too but still accessibly/easy to useCons: Dirt magnet, especially around the scroll wheel; hard to use the hold button"
4,Great numbers primer!,"I purchased the book to get a full understanding of boolean algebra, and this fit the bill to a T. If you are dealing even lightly with x-bit integers or x-base numbering systems (i.e. 32-bit integers, Hex numbers, etc.) this is the book to get. A great primer for anyone who wants to *understand* numbers, rather than just coexist with them.One caveat though...the exercises don't always match the answers in the back of the book, which proves frustrating."
5,Great books for boolean algebra,Incredible book for understanding boolean algebra. What I like about the book is the simple and clear language that the author uses and a lot of very helpful examples throughout the book to help understand the concept.
5,The very best book I have read on Boolean,"I'm a Computer Engineering student and have read many books on the subject. Until I read this book, I was constantly struggling with complex Boolean equations. Fortunately, this book has helped me master the subject -with a lot of hard work. I highly recommend this book for any student in the Computer Engineering field."
5,What the API documentation should have been,"If you do serious work in Java, then you already know that the online Javadoc documentation is incomplete, often inaccurate and entirely lacking any high-level discussion of the API. This book is everything that the online API documentation is not.Of course, if you do serious work in Java, then you already have this book."
5,Product was in perfect condition and shipped quickly.,The product came packaged like new (pieces still in sealed plastic bags). I've had the product for almost a month now and everything still works perfectly. Shipped in less than a week.
4,Big Kid's Tinker Toys,I haven't had so much fun building things since I had Tinker Toys and Legos. This kit is great. The only thing that I would say is it would be great if there were more atoms included in it. It's not the greatest at showing the boat and chair modles for cyclohexane but it's better than nothing. I'm passes O-Chem because of these things.
3,Great in conjunction with class,"A molecular model set is the best way to visualize the complicated compounds seen in Organic Chemistry. This model set is great for class. It comes with enough pieces to maybe make 4 small structures, which was not enough for me. The pieces are also difficult to pull apart."
4,Prentice Hall Molecular Model Set for Organic Chemistry,"The model set is good in size and very helpful as a visual learning tool. However, it is hard to put together and take apart."
2,review,"Models are disappointing. Size of the atoms(balls) are much smaller than expected from the ad. Thus,they are not useful for demonstrations to a class. They would work for personal use. Also, putting and taking the bonds apart takes some effort,"
3,Very small but not always the greatest photos,I love how small this camera is and that it easily fits in my pocket or purse. It is also easy to use. It takes pretty good pictures outdoors and in bright light but it definitely has it's limitations. Forget about catching anything in action/sport mode. The flash is weak and night time or low light pictures don't come out so great. I will keep this camera because it comes in handy when you're going to the amusement park or the beach and don't want to lug around a larger camera. I will use my advanced point and shoot (Kodak z812) or my DSLR (Olympus E420) instead when I want to make sure that I get some good photos.
3,Chop Chop,Still choppin away. The top of the clear plastic container is chipped - but still functional. You need to hold the whole container from underneath - keeping pressure on the cap on the bottom when you unscrew it from the chopper or you might be scraping off all your work from the counter or floor and tossing it in the trash. Works great on cutting up almonds & onions.
3,Satisfactory... but not great,"Used this for the first time today to chop some ingredients for a salad, here's my experience:Celery - worked well, had to push hard thoughTomatoes/olives - worked well, no problems.Radishes - Did not work. The radishes just stuck into the blades and prevented it from working. I had to manually pull the radishes out from between the VERY sharp blades, and quarter them before putting them back in the chopper (it worked on the quartered radishes). That was somewhat dangerous and definitely annoying.It does it's job, but as some other reviewers have mentioned it doesn't handle everything equally well. Harder veggies may need to be pre-cut, which somewhat defeats the purpose of buying a chopper in the first place..."
3,okay,iner plastic piece stuck inside cannot get it out other then that it works fine copped good as any other useded in the past
1,Wish I knew how well it worked!,"I purchased this item and when it arrived at my house, it was missing the screw part to connect it to the camera and the belt clip. I requested a replacement and when I received it, Same Problems! So I give up. I returned both and bought one from somewhere else."
2,Stay away!,"Look. This card and most of Creative sound cards are hit and miss...some of them work, other times hey crash. This time I got one that crashed.The creative software tried to take over my computer, crashed my computer, and gave me a crackling sound that affected my DJ performances. Will never buy one of their cards again.If you buy your taking a 50/50 risk on this on this junk."
5,old friends,I saw Wishbone Ash live in '73. This dvd was like a time machine. The video had this bootleg kind of look. The band looked like they just got back from Woodstock. But the music was great. It really stands the test of time. If anyone likes guitar rock this dvd is for you.
5,Great ballet class CD,I've found this CD to be especially good with begining level ballet classes. It's been one of my favorites!
3,item not complete,purchased this item hoping to use my laptop as a real time Gps.sensor required additional software (32.00-yearly subscription)to operate.also needed a active broadband card(initial price + subscription). download Google Plus (additional charge) for extra would have been less for a reg Gps.unit .too involved to be effective.unit has been sitting in my spare room as a paperweight.nothing for free from Garmin.
4,Garmin on a Budget,"I bought the Garmin GPS 18 Deluxe GPS Sensor with nRoute and City Select Navigation Software (USB Interface)as a supplement to my Garmin 60 CSX. It is with out a doubt, the best receiver that I have used, and I have used all the other brands. It finds the satellites so fast that it's almost instantaneous! The software however, is not as easy as some or as colorful as others. That said, it is competent and their customer service is absolutely the finest. Yes there is a wait on the phone but after talking to an understanding, well schooled tech who really cares, you start to appreciate what this company is all about. I love the sensor, like the software and I am in awe of the company attitude! Try it,, you'll like it. I am nearly sure!"
3,Where is Show #8??????,"Why are only shows #7 and #9 included? makes me think either #8 was really great and will cost more, sold separately, or it was incredibly bad and no one would want it..."
5,Just Beautiful,"This collection of compositions by classical guitarist Frederick Hand is a compilation of music that is quite simply beautiful. It encourages relaxation, tranquility, and a generally peaceful state of mind."
5,A Fairy Tale in more ways than one!,"As the Founder of Starbright, the children's charity that benefits from this wonderful new book, allow me to add my ten cents. This is not only a united, compelling creative collaboration between Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, Madonna, Robin Williams and the other 19 star co-writers. It is also the rare coming together of an entrepreneurial idea with a charity. Starbright helps ill children by providing educational, distractive and self-esteem enhancing audiovisual products. We do this by uniting doctors, entertainers and high tech. experts.Here in ""THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES"" we have gone a step further and united 46 world-renowned writer/stars and illustrators to create the most welcome of Christmas presents for kids aged five to a hundred and five.Thank you for helping Starbright brighten the lives of our special children, those who are seriously ill. Your purchase makes a real difference!"
4,Replacement Parts,These were replacements for my PIAA Auxiliary Lights on my bike. The original lamps lasted about 2 years and burned out within a week of each other.Replacement takes about 5 minutes per lamp. Watch out for the screws holding the old lamp in the case. There are four brass screws that are screwed down very tight and the heads strip easily.
3,Temprano para evaluar,"Mi esposa y yo hemos empezado a tomar esto desde hace solo 3 meses. No he notado nada significativo o que sea notable, pero es muy temprano aún. Se supone que estos suplementos están pensados en el largo plazo. Los seguiremos tomando en base al ""research"" que hicimos sobre sus beneficios."
4,Great toy if your baby isn't a chicken,"We gave this to our daughter for her 1st birthday after having read all the great reviews. She absolutely loves the music, and the toys attached. She will stand up in front of the zebra and spin the toys and bounce to the music. She learned really quickly how to get on and off off it but she doesn't like to sit on it and bounce. She is too short so she needs help bouncing and gets kind of scared. I am sure in a few more months we won't have any problems."
4,Go Baby Go! Bounce & Spin Zebra,18 Months old loves the Zebra and it looks like it will be able to hold up until she's 3 years old.
4,"Bounce, Bounce, Bounce",My parents gave this to my almost 1 year old for Christmas. He really likes the music and will spin the toys just to hear the music and dance next to it. He needs a little help still getting on and off but really likes to bounce. We have to spin him because it seems like he's on his tip toes and can't move it himself yet. The only con was that even with a parent holding onto him he's bounced off and smacked his face on the base twice in a week. It's definitely not a toy to be used unsupervised.
5,Great toy for children between 1 and 2 years old,"My 25-month-old son loves this toy, but he is now a little too tall for it. I offered this toy to my 15-month-old nephew and it is just perfect for him. It is a lot of fun for children, and a lot of fun for the adults watching. The toy seems to be very strong, and very safe as well."
4,great toy for 14+ months babies,I bought this for my 14 month old daughter and she got on it in the same day. Her feet can touch the ground so she wasn't scared of getting off and on the toy. She likes to rotate on the toy when she is excited (watching elmo etc). Hopefully she might enjoy bouncing too. The music played by the toy when she moves was a big attraction for her.
4,"My one year old loves this little zebra,","My son got this for his first birthday and loves it. He hasn't mastered it yet because his feet don't touch the ground completely but he loves to hold on to the handle bars and bounce and make it make music. Every time he sees it he goes strait for it, it's like a brand new every day."
4,High energy toy,"Good toy for a high energy child. It makes sounds as long as it's being bounced on or shaken. Although it was bought for my year old granddaughter, my five year old grandson sits on it and bounces around. Fun toy!"
4,Stiffer than I wanted,"This pouch is quite stiff. I was hoping to use it to protect my camera inside of my purse, but this pouch is far to rigid on it's own to be put into a purse. So, it didn't work for my purposes, but it is a great cushion/padding and I'm sure would work great for others."
3,Decent book that explains theory. Somewhat vague.,"This book does a decent job displaying the theories and equations for introductory structural dynamics. However it is lacking detailed explanation and step by step processes of how to derive and use the theories displayed. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you needed it for a class, or you were doing graduate level work that did not require a lot of explanation."
5,Works well,"When shopping for a PC, I noticed there were many cards to choose from. I wanted something with some speed, yet something that would not cost 200+ dollars. I ended up choosing this card for it's price and performance. After installing the card, and drivers, I played a few games, the graphics were great. I got transparency, fog, anti-aliasing, etc... All games I've played so far work well with this card."
5,Jillian Michaels Killer Abs,Product arrived in excellent shape and I absolutely love the workout. Jillian is quite the motivator for exercise. Using it with my other workouts for a full body routine.
1,What happened?!?,"I have mostly all of Jillian's DVDs. I love NMTZ, BFBM, 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Killer Buns & Thighs - the list goes on. I have gotten superb results by going through the DVDs and now rotate through them during the week. I work out at least 3 to 4 days straight, then take a rest day. I loved 6 Wk 6 Pack and was excited to get Killer Abs. Boy, this DVD is a disappointment - or perhaps it should have been marketed more for beginners. Anyway - her delivery is slow - bodering on boring; the exercises are re-cycled and some re-named - Military March is now Mummy Walk, really?!?!... and it doesn't offer anything that could be the next step up after 6 Wk 6 Pack. I love Jillian but this DVD is really terrible and I might give it to someone I don't like, Ha Ha Ha"
2,Jillian not as tough on abs,"I have several other Jillian workouts, and this one is not as good as her others. I do not feel like it really targets the abs, but is still more of a general workout. If you are looking to really improve and tone your abs this is not your workout."
2,Mediocre,"A nice enough story about how reading is beneficial and how you should read even if people ridicule you. But the writing is halting, the pirate banter and the bunny-based alliteration is tedious, and the ""inside jokes"" aren't that funny for a five-year-old (""Rabbitson Crusoe"" ... ha ha). Plus it's quite sad to see the bunnies getting ready to kill a dog. (The story would have been much more impressive if Henry had taken his nose out of his book to save the dog. But alas, reading is good....) I won't rush out to buy my own copy after I give this one back to the library."
5,A fascinating story of an idea turning into a business.,"If you want to understand what's involved with starting an internet business from scratch, this book will provide a detailed look at how CDnow became successful, despite humble beginnings. The story of Jason and Matthew Olim's business, from concept to profitable operation, is fascinating, and instructive for entrepreneurs and corporate types alike. With the able guiding hand of Peter Kent (the journalist/author) this book is well-written and easy to read. I'd recommend it highly."
3,waste of money,"I passed the test, but this book did not help me in my preparation at all. Truly it did not. Also, consider borrowing the book from a local school system... Schools often have professional development libraries that have Praxis workbooks to check-out."
3,Australian Bond Patriot Games,"1980's overblown spy drama with John Barry-like music throughout the movie. Emissary is about an married attache who hold sensitive documents that could trigger World War 3, if it falls into the wrong hand of a rogue nation. The wife of the emissary has a secretive past that her enemies would exploit to their benefit. Fast-pace action with a Bondian type conclusion."
3,Not as Good as They Used to Be,"I bought this cookie sheet unaware that it was a ""nonstick."" That was my error in not reading closer. I have two very old AirBake Insulated pans that I love; so unable to find them in the stores, I bought this one here. It arrived fast but the the box was torn. When I removed the pan, there were several dimpled areas on top of the pan which were from the kimpled stamping all over the back. I don't like these dimpled areas because it makes it more difficult to clean. Everything said, I have baked two pans on cookies and they have turned out well. I didn't read anywhere where you could use a metal spatula, but I used one. So far, no scratching is seen. I won't buy another non-stick cookie sheet. I think the shiny metal ones do a much better job of baking."
4,Be careful - Sensitive,"My baking tray worked great for a year until I accidently used a pizza slicer (silicon) to slice a few things while still on the tray. The pressure of the slicer caused long dents to form on the pan and warped it slightly, and I am now looking for a replacement.So be careful with how you handle things on the pan. Also be careful when washing it because it has a tendency to warp slightly over time even before my pizza slicer incident.I also agree with other reviewers regarding cookies. I am not acookie fanatic but they do become awfully thin on this pan and a little difficult to scrap off without smushing. But overall this product was a HUGE step up from parchment paper/ other standard baking trays."
4,Just as I remember it,"It is still crisp, clean and fresh sounding ... nostalgia played a huge part in this purchase(I used to have the album on vinyl about 30 years ago.)A great mix of songs from a mix of writers. Simply performed, arranged and produced - what this music is all about. A very real listening experience."
2,Pretty blah,I read this for a book group. It gets two stars because it wasn't a tough book to finish. But it left me wondering why bother? This was a sentiment shared so strongly by my book group that we never saw the person who recommended the book again. Ouch. Bottom-line: Competently written but so many better reads are out there.
1,Which iPod do you have? How to pick the iSkin?,"I have now been shipped two iSkins for my 60Gig, and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place. There are at least three flavors of 60 Gig iPods in the marketplace at present, and more coming, it appears, so be careful which one you order. The manufacturer's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin, even if you know the model number of your iPod. I also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake. Throw it away."
2,Ok if you are a mathematician,Good if you know the subject or are a mathematician. Arfken's Mathematical Methods for Physicists book has a section that is better than this book. The problem is that it is not extensive.
5,Skirts are for women and pants are for men....Always,"It used to be that way. Now, girls can wear pants if they like, and well, men wear pants too, always, no skirts. One day, Amelia Bloomer is sick of little girls looking too nice to play, and skirts are NOT practically for fun. Amelia takes a stand and makes.....BLOOMERS!~ErinAge 11"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book after learning that this series featured a sleuth named Miss Silver who knitted her way through the mystery. Being a knitter myself and a huge fan of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, I was really looking forward to reading every book in the series but was highly disappointed when Miss Silver appears infrequently throughout the book and has very little to say even when she does! I guess I will just have to reread Agatha's!"
1,Tedious Historical Mystery - England,"Charles and his ex-fiancee Margaret wind up the reluctant protectors of an immature, self-centered heiress being pursued by a mysterious criminal mastermind.Absolutely awful. There is no reason for Charles and Margaret to keep the girl rather than getting police help for her, there are no likable characters, and Miss Silver is an unbelievably perfect PI who barely appears in the story. I couldn't get into it at all."
5,Great product 3rd vehicle I have used it in.,K&N makes a great product. These drop in filters are well worth the extra cost upfront and are great for engine performance and gas mileage. You need to remember to clean them with the K&N products once a year. I have purchased them for 3 of my vehicles :).
5,oem replacement,got of brother inlaw for x mass. after he opened it we went out side and installed it in no time
2,Not very durable but my daughter loves it,This book is a simple story of the Noo Noo cleaning up after the Teletubbies using stills from the tv shows. My daughter loves the story but I have found that the flaps and the pop-up at the end is not very durable and all ripped within the first week or two that we had it. I don't think my daughter (2 years at the time) was especially rough with the pages since our [other pop up books] ...are still going strong ... I just don't think this book is as good a quality as it could be.
4,very helpful to us,"We just bought this book and my son wanted to read it three times in a row the first day. We adopted a daughter with Down Syndrome a few months ago and her younger brother has been struggling to understand and accept her. This book has provided him with technical information he needed to understand the syndrome, spiritual information he needed to see his sister through God's eyes and insights he needed to process his own emotions and come out loving his sister more. Thanks Larry Jansen! I plan to pass this book around to friends and family to use to explain down syndrome to their children as well. The only drawback I see in the book has to do with the way Mr. Jansen explains disabilities as what makes some people special. All people have their own gifts and strengths regardless of a disability."
2,Misleading description of book,"This book title was misleading. I was under the impression that the song book would contain books Nos 1-3, but it was only book one."
3,A15-S157,I have had my Toshiba for a few years and here's what I have had to deal with:1. CPU fan stopped working2. Bulb in screen went out3. Hinges are toast - screen won't stay open4. Latch to keep lid closed broke5. Hard drive crapped out6. Left side of keyboard quit functioningDo not buy Toshiba!!!! They're disposable.
1,Not Worth the Time to Watch,"What on earth does 'gayness' have to do with this story? This is nothing but a not so cleverly disguised progay movie. If Holiday had been any other kind of eccentric other than a carnal. warped one, it might have been a movie worth watching. If you care about traditional, righteous values, skip this movie. There are too many wholesome similar movies to waste time on this one."
4,"Good Games, great deal","Risk and Monopoly run great on my intel based Macbook. Both are well-done and entertaining, and the combo price is the same that I have seen individual ones sell for. Everyone knows what to expect with these- they aren't the greatest games of all time but are worthwhile. I have not yet tired Scrabble."
1,Horrible Answering Machine Audio,"It's a shame, I like everything about this phone except the answering machine audio quality. It's a garbled mess. I don't know what AT&T was thinking. They made a good phone with nice features, user-friendly but then installed the worst answering machine. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. This unit lured me in with the price when I did a side-by-side visual comparison at the store. It looked better than anything else in its price category. The phone is laid out nicely and easy to use. I like the handset speaker, too, so I can set the phone down and talk. Caller ID, call log, and directory and all work fine. But I was appalled the first time I heard the sound quality of a recorded message. Horrible! A good phone with a really bad answerer."
4,Good Product,Came timely as advertized. Working fine to extend the life of my battery that will be outside during the cold winter months ahead.
1,Looks like I have to buy another toaster,"I agree that on looks alone the toaster is great, but due to a poorly built circuit card the safety of this product is seriously suspect. The problem is that a resistor burns out (R3 for anyone that cares). Mine happened to burn out while I was out of the house. Yes I should have unplugged it, but I didn't. With this resistor out it will not allow for any of the toast settings to work nor will it automatically pop up. So, if you put some bread in and walk away expecting a nicely toasted piece of bread you might want to keep a fire extinguisher handy. The manual says not to leave the toaster unattended when in use, but really what is the use of having an auto popup toaster if you have to hang around and watch it."
1,returned after one day,"This toaster looked nice and I thought Oster made quality products so I bought this inexpensixe toaster. It worked poorly from the first attempt to toast. Only one side of the bread would toast and the toast wouldn't pop all the way up so I returned it the next day.I received an Everstar toaster as a Christmas gift and I'm very happy with it. It has wide slots, toasts beautifully and pops up with no problem. I didn't see this toaster on Amazon but I found it on a Web search at Home Depot for $19.99"
4,"Lasted longer than average, I guess!","I had this toaster for 4 years, and it worked great until one day it up and died. Reading the other reviews, I guess I was lucky my lasted as long as it did! Too bad! It's the perfect size and looks great with my other stainless appliances. But based on its bad track record, I guess I won't be buying another one to replace it."
2,The Beginnings of a Better Man,"Gann's most self - centered protagonist doesn't even come off as that good a pilot; and has every reason to reflect at the end, ""I did it my way!"" At his best, Benjamin Lawless is Kiffin Draper in embryo, and a critical difference is that, for all his faults and that he never grows up, you can't help but like Kiffin, maybe even admire him.If you're a Gann devotee, you'll want a copy for the shelf. the advice from here is to order from the bottom of the price range."
1,Do not buy,I own this projector and I give it a rating zero however 1 is the lowest I can go. Do not buy.
3,nice size but careful with the room light,Is small and very easy to carry. But in order to see what you are projecting you need to be in a dark atmosphere. It will not work with office lights on.
1,very disappointed,"The first few times I used my pan (for pannekoeken) I was very pleased. But then I noticed a little fleck of the black non-stick coating had come off. I didn't think much about it and went to use it again. Only this time the non-stick coating han bubbled and more of the coating had come off. Needless to say, I have not used the pan since and I'm waiting for a reply from the manufacture to see if I have inadvertently poisoned my family with who knows what toxin from the coating off the pan. Beware!"
1,Very disappointed,"I have a number of Norpro bakeware items that I use regularly, so I thought that this pan would be of just as high quality. But unfortunately, it is NOT. The non-stick surface started coming off the first time I used it. The frittata turned out lovely; the pan looks horrible."
3,The Daugher of Night by Jeneth Murrey (Large Print Harlequin Hardcover),"Description from the book back cover:Since her mother had abandoned her at birth, and had since married a rich man, and since her beloved foster-mother was ill and needed a large sum of money to pay for medical treatment, Hester Marsh hadn't any compunction about demanding money from her mother. It seemed only justice. But the formidable Demetrios Thalassis took a very different view of the situation. He would supply the money, he told Hester - but in return he needed a wife. And if she wouldn't agree, he would bring criminal charges against her. So what else could Hester do ...?"
4,Great films - worthless 'music',"The Alloy Orchestra has no idea what they're doing - the idea is to support the film, not compete with it. The film is the star after all - in the future I would never buy a silent film on video that has the Alloy Orchestra behind it, it's the quickest way I know to obtain a massive headache."
2,Not the originals,"The songs in this collection are NOT the original recordings by the Grass Roots, as the fine print at the bottom of the album cover vaguely suggests. Listen to the previews. The band is competent, but I didn't want covers of the songs I grew up with--unfortunately, I purchased MP3 downloads of some of the individual songs from this collection before I realized my mistake. Caveat emptor."
4,Flea Market Madness,"If you are frenzied over Fire-King, bonkers over Bakelite, cuckoo over kitsch, or otherwise very silly over vintage stuff, you'll want to collect this charming first novel by Sharon Fiffer about junque junkie Jane Ray - Oops! make that Jane Wheel.If you don't know jade from Jadite, or a new Planter's Peanut planter from a real McCoy, you may be way less enamored and only bid 3 stars. And maybe the names of victim and sleuth - Balance and Wheel, will leave you listing.But for afficiandas of The Grand Quest, it's a signature 5 star-- more murderous fun than a year of yard sales! Reviewed by TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,Is it WKRP all over again...MUSIC EDITED,"Yep, it is happening again. Just learned today that not only the title song, but some music from within season 8 has been edited out...and...yes some scenes. They placed a disclaimer on the boxed set that some scenes may be missing or different than original network airing."
2,What an awful season.,"Really. The complete lack of Leo, the loss of Darryl, and the intro of Billie, this season just sucked.The only good thing was seeing Piper and Leo happy...until they couldn't afford to pay for Leo to be in the show anymore. I would have gotten rid of Billie and kept Leo!I watched until episode 10, then skipped to the end. The middle is just crap."
4,Charmed will be forever missed.,This isn't the best season of the series. With that said it did have its great moments and I feel if you are a fan of the show it does finish off the collection. The final 2 episodes are probably 2 of the best episodes of the series. I will miss this show but I am glad that they did get to end it right with closure and a sense of things to come.
5,Excelent,"It is the first time I buy on Amazon, product quality very good, so good even running, I'm from Latin America and the product arrived at my home with no problems I recommend"
1,This software killed my machine,"This software is hazardous. I had a perfectly good working Win XP Pro, fast, high-end machine. Now I have a machine that takes forever to boot, if it boots, and has too many NEW problems to mention that all arrived with my installation of this software. All I wanted to do was upgrade my harddrive now I am forced to re-install everything and start from scratch just to get a good configuration. I have used Ghost in the past and it was simple.Not only did it kill my machine but even with my machine booted with the last known good configuration the software does not work at all. I am a Systems Analyst and I have repaired, configured, tested, installed many machines and software and in all my days I have never seen such an outright piece of trash....well except for maybe the early days of Microsoft patches where you always made sure to back up your system first or face the consequences.Buyer beware!!!!"
1,Beware of DriveImage 7 : it's a trap!,"PowerQuest sells you their DriveImage 7 upgrade promising you that you will be able to create a backup image of your drives on dvd.Not true in my case. I have win2k and upgraded from DI 2000 in order to have a backup of my C drive on one or two dvds instead of a dozen Cds, but ...If I backup the drive (10 GB,standard compression) on a hard disk, it takes about 7 minutes. On dvd : after seven hours (!!!) it had done about 22%. Which should mean about 30+ hours to complete the backup...I called PowerQuest and told them the sad news in July.In August they asked me to wait for a patch. In October, a few days ago, they told me that I could download an upgrade: Drive Image 7.01 which should solve the problem. Not true: nothing has changed.I shall ask for a refund."
1,Version 7 is not stable,I am using PQ products almost 5 years and agree with all previous reviewes version 7 is bad. I had problem with XP Home edition. There is no dicent support for current product. (...) Symantec blaming PQ and PQ are diluted in the Symantec - endless loop.
2,"Disturbing, uncomfortable, heart-breaking","The book is a cross between Angela's Ashes and The Curious Case of the Dog in the Night-Time. The narrator is an adolescent boy who has developmental problems and has a family ill-equipped to deal with them. There is a false note of hope at the end of the book, but we know enough about the characters at this point to know that no happy ending will ever occur. There are brief dark moments of sexual tension between the mother and son that are quite uncomfortable and just add to the sense that the reader is a voyeur watching damaged human beings. The writing is quite good, but the subject matter is heart-breaking."
5,great books for every book lover,"this book is fun reading for itself, let alone suggesting other books to read. The small reports of each listed book are well written with pretty concise overall book subject. nice book to keep handy for a few minute read."
3,Fun to Look Through - But Inconsistent and Lacking Authors,"I am an avid reader, and thought it would be fun to see how many of the books listed I either owned or had read. One of the reviews said the categories were strange - and I would agree but also the categories are kind of fun the way they are arranged, and you can check by author name and/or title in the back in the Index. What I found surprising was great authors completely missing from this compendium. Like H.G.Wells; Robert Heinlein; Piers Anthony; James Lee Burke; Phyllis Whitney; and in the Spiritual Section, the Bible was not listed either. Granted, the bible is a collection of books, but I was still surprised. However, I would still recommend taking a look through, because it is an interesting collection. But remember, it is one man's opinion of all the great works of time, so consider that and don't take it as the end all/be all of informative reading advice."
5,Helpful info; quick and easy recipes for the whole family,"At last, a ""diabetic"" cookbook that lives up to it's promise of tasty recipes for the whole family. I have been looking for a cookbook with recipes that are good for my diabetes, but doesn't require me to make a separate meal for the rest of the family. We all enjoyed ""Western Style Chicken Pizza"" and ""Cinnamon Apple Raisin Slaw"".The ""Cream Filled Chocolate Cupcakes"" were wonderful! The first part of the book explains the basics of carbohydrate counting, which is the diet plan my doctor thinks is best for me to keep my diabetes under control.It even includes a sample record keeping page which I can xerox to keep all my food, medicine and blood sugar information in one place. I also liked the index, which has the recipes listed according to number of carbohydrate grams and choices. I haven't seen anything like this in all the diabetes cookbooks I've bought. All in all, a very helpful book which I will use often!"
5,A great No-Nonsense approach to managing my diabetes!,"As someone who has lived with diabetes my entire life, I have constantly struggled with finding a simple and straight-forward way to control my blood sugars. This book gave me an easy way to better manage this disease. It gives alot of helpful hints and ideas that keep me wanting to succeed in my fight. Thanks to the authors for writing such a life-changing book."
5,Great Album Made Even Better By Remastering,"This reissue of Foghat's NIGHT SHIFT, which was a great album to begin with, is made even better by warm, thick remastering and the inclusion of the previously unreleased ""New Place To Call Home"", which was listed on the original LP jacket but not included. This version rights that wrong. The singing, guitar playing, and rhythm work are all top-notch, and although FOOL FOR THE CITY and LIVE are slightly better, this album still tops most of what's called ""rock"" today."
5,The Best Work Out Book To Date,"I made a New Year's resolution and that was to get fit. My wife baught me Hot Point Fitness because she read about it in one of her women's magazines. This was the best gift I have ever received. I usually hate getting books as gifts, but this one has changed my life. I have followed the author's routines very closely and I have already changed my body shape and as a result, my life. I am less tired during the day, I have lost 15 lbs. and I have a whole new outlook on my health and fitness. I was ready to make this change on my own, but this book made it that much easier for me to do.Steve Zim knows his stuff! I recommend this book to anyone who wants to look better and change their life to a healthy one. This book was the best present I ever received!"
2,"Decent content, horribly written book","I've never seen so many typos, dropped words, and punctuation errors in my entire life - almost every other page. Many of the typos are fairly minor, but others are absurd.For instance, on page 24: ""After just a few weeks, this form of exercise will not exhaust you, but conversely, will get all the endomorphs flowing and actually boost your energy level."" Get all the ENDOMORPHS flowing? All the little fat people in my body will be flowing? I know he must have meant endorphins, but it's just comical to read something like that from an expert, whether it was his fault or the publisher's.The content isn't anything new, but does make sense. Too bad it's such a struggle to get through."
4,Colorful fun book and smells strong!,"I used to love scratch and sniff when I was a kid so I got this for my son. He is only 18 months so isn't into it yet but I figure he will enjoy it later and it's hard to find these books since they aren't in print anymore! I love all the DK board books we have and I don't know why they would stop printing the scratch and sniff ones. This particular book is fun because it's got lots of colors and fun party items. The scented areas are HUGE so it's easy for little ones to scratch. It has pineapple, cake, cola, grape bubbles and peppermint candy scents. I like all the smells but I did think it was kind of weird to have scented bath bubbles as one of the party items. I guess it could be a gift and it smells good. I think this is a really fun book and I can't believe how strong it smells since it was printed 12 years ago! I definitely recommend and wish they would make more of these."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this after market replacement battery for my Canon S200 as a back up to the orignal battery I got with the camera. I had hoped that I could use it in the field to swap out batteries when I took lots of shots and used up the battery charge.It worked for a while, but now the battery won't hold a charge, whereas the original Canon manufactured battery is still going strong. It holds a charge just fine. Pay the price and buy the original, and stay away from these knock offs."
5,holy s****,"F***kI've been waiting for music like this, makes me feel alive.The record is even better live, its totally unbelievable, it literally puts all other live bands to shame. S***t. There is no other band I've seen that makes the whole room erupt like Celebration. holy crap. honestly."
1,This DVD is a fraud,This unauthorized DVD uses grainy copies of other published material and a cover band called The Tribe to play the Pink Floyd songs. The only original material is from a bunch of unknowns commenting on the band.It is a horrendous ripoff and I only wished I read reviews here before I wasted my money!It is nothing like the Darkside of the Moon DVD which I previously bought. Even that had a defect that locks it up. If there were zero stars I would give it that.
1,In the name of the Lord STOP these Reviews,"Amazon doesn't allow me to put zero stars, so that's why I HAD to put one star.No vintage live performance of the band, just a small glimpse and useless portion of it. By the way, it's very hard to find material from WYWH and Animals period in an acceptable condition.Interviews and comments should come from the people who actually lived the experience an were part of the story and not from Mostly Autumn members."
1,I Feel Cheated,"I bought This DVD expecting it to be a follow-up to the ""Classic Albums: Dark Side Of The Moon."" (Which Is Superb, by the way). It is not!Unlike the Dark Side DVD, there are no new interviews with band members, or performances by the band. It can be very factual, And may teach you about the process of making WYWH, but this is obviously produced by a two-bit studio that wanted to cash in on the Floyd's Popularity. Oh, And The host is pretty difficult to look at. Let's just say he's Extremely English. It simply was not an enjoyable film for me to watch."
3,"Not bad, just not what I expected","The Dark Side of the Moon disc was much better. This one isn't done by the band, so the insight isn't was good as DSOTM. There are some brief interviews and comments from the band, but they are all from other sources.Strange versions of some of the tunes, too. Definitely not by Pink Floyd.Worth getting if you are a fan, just a little odd, that's all."
5,Decent Stand; Great Price,"This cymbal stand was a perfect addition for our old drum set. It's not fancy or particularly heavy duty, but it's perfectly adequate. In fact, it was much better quality than I was expecting for the price. Great value!"
1,Cheap,It is poorly constructed and leaked so I had to throw it out. I would not recommend buying this product.
2,Broken hanger,"Item itself looks good (+1 star), but it was broken due to inappropriate packaging. So I was not be able to try it.Hanger is completely broken and makes this product unusable (unless you will figure out how to hang feeder). Hanger was outside its original box."
4,Ant Moat,Works good in holding the fluid. I just have to see if it stops ants with the ant moat. No sign of ants yet eating the fluid.
3,Daughter LOVES books but not this one...,"I was excited to get her this BIG book because she loves to look at books and point to the pictures and I name them for her...she is 12 months old. I thought she would sit on the book and look at everything but I think there is too much going on and it keeps her attention for about 1 minute and then she goes and gets one of her other books. The other thing that I don't really care about with the book is that things have ""weird different names"" to identify them (pumpkin car, etc). Maybe she'll grow into it...time will tell!"
2,Run of the mill,"Nothing very exciting or fresh here. Seems like these guys could be the cover band at your favorite watering hole. Not wholly unpleasant, but the vast majority of the tunes beg to be remembered. Not one of Spinarts finest."
5,Algebra in good hands,"Recieved product in great condition, quick service. Still have not watched but if its like Algebra tutor volume 1, safe to say it will be very much used.Thank you very much"
1,A Total Waste of Time and Money,"This chord book is for music theorists and serious guitarists who have received formal training. I have been playing guitar for 35 years, including flamenco and rock guitar, and I am completely irritated at the mislabeling of this book - it actually dares to say ""easy to use""!! I just wanted buy a regular, everyday chord book, one where you could actually go find the ""A"" chord on a page in some logical and normal way and it would show a normal array of variations (please pardon me for living). Instead this displays a confusing listing, such as Major 6 - 3rd in bass (1st inversion). Just what is that supposed to mean to an everyday guitar player and why doesn't the sales pitch explalin how different this is? I am returning this book immediately."
2,The Ultimate Guitar Chord Big Book,"I din't like this book - it's extremely difficult to find chords quickly. I guess it is for guitar players more advanced than me, but I think it is not very user friendly for players at my humble level."
2,Not worth the money,"This book was quite a disappointment. What little bits of new information you might glean were buried in disorganized details. Example of two sentences from page 192 on the role of the queen's family: ""Richard II was more fortunate, and perhaps more careful, with his half-brothers than Henry III had been. John Holland and his nephew Thomas Holland were members of Richard's inner circle in the 1390s, but were spared by Henry IV, probably at least in part because John had married Henry's sister Elizabeth, but possibly also because their influence over the king was not considered as malign as that of the chamber knights of the 1380s, nor had Richard aroused resentment against them by so heaping them with honours as he had his cousin the earl of Ruland or William le Scrope."" Huh? This is a book about Margarent of Angou, Elizabeth Woodville, Anne Neville and Elizabeth or York?"
3,'Nobody' was a huge hit in Brasil!,"A good start for a brilliant career, is what I have to say about this good album, now finally available on CD. It flopped in US charts, but, here in Brasil, the track 'Nobody' was a huge hit, released as a single with ""Slippery St. Paul"" in the B side. I can't believe ""Nobody"" was not a massive hit worldwide. Hear this marvelous song, not available in any compilations, and agree with me."
2,Don't Buy it for the Photo Images,"I have been searching everywhere for a product featuring professional, diverse photos. Where have they all gone? I am returning this product because I have no use for clipart and the photos are clearly pulled from somebody's old photo albums. They are no where near the professional quality shown on the box. Many photos are dark or horribly formatted and/or just plain cheesy. However, I am very impressed by Nova's ""No Questions Asked Money Back Guarantee."" Hooray for that!"
1,No keywords or search index,"This clip art collection is a big disappointment. The quality of the vector graphics is quite low, but a bigger problem is the search engine. They include a tool called Portfolio Browser, but it does not offer any keywords or text search. Instead, you must load one ""portfolio"" at a time by navigating to a folder on the CD. This is a very inefficient way to sort through 30,000 images, since each folder may contain only 100 or so pictures.You can copy the CDs to a hard drive (manually), but when you open the portfolio folders it demands that you insert the CD to load the image. With such a large number of CDs, this too is unwieldy.So to summarize, this is a collection of 30,000 low-quality images without a usable search or browsing capability. I do not envision myself ever using this."
3,Photos are old,The clip art is great but the Photos are from the 70's and 80' so if you need really old photos its great.
1,Could not get past Chapter 8,"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read! I could not bring myself to finish it. I am an avid reader of books and this book could not do anything for me.I could not feel for the characters, there simply was no emotion leaping from the pages. Christianna was simply too good to be true.I loved all Danielle's early books. They made me cry!But this one, I just nodded off and fell asleep!"
1,NOT 150 WATTS,"i PURCHASED A CASE OF THE 150 WATT BULBS because I could no longer purchase them at my Ace Hardware store. The price was about the same -- my complaint, they are NOT 150 watt -- when I put the first one in my ceiling next to the three others, it was TOTALLY evident -- my friends and I tried two more -- the same thing -- not nearly as much lightRipped off again !!!"
2,A Cure for Insomnia,"An incredibly boring novel billed as a saga equivalent to The Thorn Birds. Not so much. The plot, such as it is, revolves around the daughter of the first governor of New South Wales (Australia). She falls in love with a French explorer (actual historic person), has his child out of wedlock and the rest of the story follows her life along with the development of Australia as a country.Amazingly, there is very little dialogue in this novel....far more telling going on than showing. As a result, if you're suffering from insomnia this book might help bring sleep back into your vocabulary. Despite the high potential for the subject matter and some great historical characters making an appearance, the author managed to dull them all down.I can't in good conscious recommend this one.....if you're interested in the history of Australia, even Aaron Fletcher's Outback Series is better than this."
1,Misleading - true contents hidden,"While the Amazon blurb speaks of calcium and magnesium citrate, the truth is both are combinations of citrate and carbonate, as the label shows once you receive a bottle. If Amazon were to show a picture of the government required label for all supplements, we would have a better idea of actual contents.Worse, the amount of calcium per 4 soft gels is only 40% of ""Daily Value."" So one should actually take around 10 soft gels/day. No thank you. This fact is also hidden from the buyer's view and only revealed when he reads the back label."
1,Not the original quality,"I recently ordered four additional place settings as well as a few replacement forks/spoons of Dansk Torun. I have an original set from the mid 1980's. The new pieces were much lighter in weight, the spoons had different bowl shapes (both soup and teaspoon) and stamps on the back of each piece (including the 'made in China') were obnoxiously large and made the silverware ugly. I purchased these with a 'buy three get one free offe'r. Had I been aware of the poor quality of this recent edition of Dansk silverware I would not have purchased it new. I would have purchased used place settings from a replacement source."
5,"Lovely, durable silverware","At $29.99 per place setting, Amazon is offering this pattern at outlet prices for Torun. I have owned this silverware for over 10 years, and it looks as good today as when I purchased it. The stainless is of the highest grade, 18/10, and this ensures that it will tolerate the dishwasher very well. Instructions that came with mine said to polish it once a year, but I have not found this necessary. The stainless is of a quality that it doesn't show scratches either. The design is timeless; it will be as contemporary 25 years from now as today. It is also versatile enough to use for every day and formal occasions. The only thing that takes getting used to is the knife; the curved handle allows for positioning the knife with the blade down. Also be aware that complementary and serving pieces are going to be expensive and hard to find. These can be located on Ebay or in any remaining outlet stores that Dansk may have."
5,Awesome book,It was a really awesome book I loved it is a good chapter book I would recommend it it might not be a little kid book it is meant for kid 8 and up I think.
4,Good but short,"TRUE TO THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES THIS IS THE BEGINNING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF SOME TEENAGERS WHO GET LEFT BEHIND AFTER THE RAPTURE. This is a Christian book. It is also a novel. The story is engaging, although not very long for an intro book to the series. It almost supposes that the reader has already read the other SERIES. Fast paced but not theologically in-depth. The authors make quite a few assumptions about the general lay person's knowledge or, lack there of, of the bible. That being said, it might make a teen interested enough in the story to get more curious about their own spiritual formation."
5,Eyes opened wide,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Left Behind series of books about the kids. If anyone does not know about God and is not aware of the choice you have to make as an individual in your lifetime, these books will really make you think. The thought of being left behind horrifies me. You do not know what your future will hold or if you will ever get another chance. As the four children eyes were being opened wide, they realized what they had missed and were going to do everything it takes to try again, this time better though. I recommend this series of books to everyone everywhere. It will really open your eyes and make you think."
1,oh no Zero rating!,"Come on people!One would have to be sick in the head to give their child a book about the apocalypse. If the aim of the book is to frighten children they only succeeded partly. I would be scared IF my parents gave me this book. I can just imagine a group of children having this read to them at sunday school. Now this children is a literal interpretation of what will happen if you dont behave and have no faith! Come on, Bleeech!"
3,Better for older children,"We got this canopy for my then four year-old. It worked great for her bed because the bed had legs you could tie the supports to (ties come with it). This made it sturdy. However, I have two other small children and they broke the side supports just by reaching up and grabbing them. They are made of a very thin piping that can not withstand any weight at all. I think this would be great for an only-child, or when any other children are at least five."
4,"Great entertainment, mediocre dvd","The film is as expected, excellent. The DVD however can only be played in stand-alone dvd players and is not recognized by desktop dvd-drives."
5,Why negative reviews?,"My point- the picture obviously shows a brushed finish, as compared to the piece that connects it to the chain, and the description states ""20 inch chain"", I am uncertain why the negative reviews reflect the product, rather than the buyer's reluctance to investigate the item before purchase. I have one, and it is exactly as described. I'm very happy with the purchase. It is light, not ""flashy"" and offers a nice alternative to ""bling"". Buy one with confidence."
4,"Kevin Costner, great actor","I love the movie, anything with Kevin Costner is always a delight to watch, so is Madeline Stowe and Anthony Quinn. It was a great love story but with a tragic ending."
1,Director's Cut RUINS This Movie!,"I can't believe I bought this ""blu-ray"" and did not get the original version of the movie and this ""director's cut"" of the movie totally cut out some of the most crucial scenes of the original movie that made the original movie one of my favorites! I am SO DISAPPOINTED in this so called ""director's cut"" and if they wanted to ruin the original... they should have at least, given the consumer the opportunity to view both versions on the blu-ray! If you are a fan of the original of this movie or have heard about how great this movie is...DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! :("
5,The young Costner,What can you say. Everything I've seen that Kevin Costner did was good. Enjoyed the movie. The quality was excellent.
2,Boring and unbelievable,"The acting is fine, but the story has all the excitement of paint drying. Nothing in the plot makes much sense. It has all the intelligence of a mindless action flick, but they forgot to include any action."
5,I STILL cry everytime I see this movie!,The most beautiful but tragic love stories ever. The love scenes are beautiful along with the scenes of the two falling in love. The end I still cry my eyes out till I have a headache all day!
3,Good suggestions; some dated information,"I bought this book used from Amazon. It was useful to have along on a recent car-camping trip to northern California. Some of the information was dated, and we wondered if the authors had actually visited one campground (swim in the stream?-- it was freezing, even in August), but the camping suggestions from the book we used were good ones, and not obvious to newcomers to northern California."
4,"emphasis - ""car camping""","A good book for car campers going on a road trip. I refered to this book on my trip to Oregon around mid-March(just before peak season) and yes, some of the campgrounds were out of they way to the point of almost being eery, But, in a good way :)If you're thinking these campgrounds are somewhere amidst the wild, you're mistaken and need to look elsewhere though.Very good for quick reference for last minute camping en route. The map included indicating locations of the campgrounds is very helpful.The book requires some updating as far as availability of campgrounds goes (year round/ seasonal),but that will probably happen in the next edition.I would recommend this book handsdown."
2,Difficult and boring,"Cute idea from the original Giga pets, but these newer ones are a pain in the butt to take care of. You cannot feed or take care of your pet until you have enough money to buy food or the supplies it needs, and digging for the right amount of money takes hours. It's been awhile since I've used this, but I don't recall the instructions being too detailed. I don't remember there being a goal with these pets like there is with original Giga Pets and tamagotchis (I.E. growing up, changing). The Pixie will always be a pixie...digging for lost treasure. Very boring. I did not buy this from amazon (or seller)"
5,"Awesome! Thanks, Amazon, for this vendor!!!","Really enjoyed doing business with this vendor, and will shop with them again. Very good quality and generous quantity of WhiteSage. Did find a little bit of mold in the final wands, but it's been being stored for quite some time. Was wrapped pretty tight... could have been a little damp when originally bundled, but it was fine. I see that the bundles are smaller now :) Still works for me!"
1,Polemic,"This is a sad piece of anti-Catholic polemic, produced in an age when it was not only acceptable but fashionable to hate ""popery."" Not suitable reading for anyone."
3,badbones,Not as good as I remember when I watched it as a teenager. I would put this movie in the middle of Gary's over all westerns. My favorite is Vera Cruz with him and Burt Lancaster.
3,gun rest,"Wellmade but a little awkward to shoot with. A beanbag might be better unless you need to hit a dime at 400 yards in which case, this will work well."
3,Fun but lots of work,"Ultimately it's difficult to keep this type of ""pet"" content. We (my son and I) liked the game and the product but have grown tired of trying to help the pet become happy (as in, we have other things to do in our lives). The batteries are toast but they're extremely rugged!"
3,Tibet needs the press...,"Adventures abound but I found the writing to be lacking in depth and style. Even with this complaint the book was a pleasant read. Predictably though, you just kind of knew everything would come out perfectly in the end."
3,Could have been a masterpiece,"A beautifully written book with a breath of fresh Mediteranean air in the beginning and wonderful characters. Three-quarters of the way through the book, though, I felt like I had a touch of Minnesota cabin fever which left me gasping for spring and the tortuous ordeal to be over. Could have been a brillant piece of literature, if the same magic of the first chapters carried itself to the end. With that said, I am still picking it as our bookclub's July read, because it reminds us of the Italian-American experience in an insightful manner with touches of comedy and sadness which makes for a good discussion and a great Italian feast."
4,i love this book,"This was a very interesting Book. it was a little hard to get into, but when I started to learn more about the charachters, it was very interesting, I really liked the book, it was a little hard to read though with all of the Italian words since I do not know Italian, but still an excellent read."
4,Well written first novel,"I found this novel both surprising and enchanting. Giordano weaves a wonderful tale full of odd characters that stick with you long after finishing, especially the main character ChiChi.Tomato is basically a coming-of-age story that revolves around ChiChi Maggiordino, a girl who has just relocated from Italy to Minnesota. What makes the story read so well is the narration of ChiChi, who tries to get the attention of God by completing bizarre rituals that she creates (walking backward for a mile, closing her eyes and saying ""breathe"" two thousand times, and so on.)The only down side to the novel is, as the story progresses, there is a delay in the coming-of-age process. It seems ChiChi never comes of age, or at least takes too long to get there.Despite that, it is very much a good read and worth picking up."
3,Ancient Queens of Egypt.,"This is an OK book for those who do not know much about ancient Egypt. In fact not much is known about Nefertiti other than what people have uncovered when exploring the ruins of this great empire. Samson does a good job on explaining the theories of Nefertiti and her husband and daughters. Samson spends less time on Cleopatra, although more is known of her. For a more detailed explaination of these figures, try something Michael Grant has written. For those seeking an introduction to these great figures, this is a nice book."
4,Good Start for Learning,"This is a very interesting video. It does a good job of outlining the basics of Islam, and has what seems to be a good explanation of how Islam started, though I personally question if some parts are true. Overall it gives a good basic understanding so you can go research and learn more for yourself."
3,Elementary . . .,"This DVD is for those beginning a study of Islam. Our class found ""Islam Empire of Faith"" much more helpful for our review and for gaining further insight into the historical and cultural aspects of the faith."
5,Great introduction to Islam!,"Mr. Bogart does a great job of breaking it down for people who might be easily confused. He has a pleasant voice which is easy to listen to, much like David Attenborough. I enjoyed the video very much. It is also a great help when reading about this subject in my Humanities textbook."
5,Best book I own on lighting,"This book is comprehensive on the subject of studio lighting. The chapter on portrait lighting alone is worth the purchase price. The principles it teaches are straightforward and easily learned, and applicable to a universe of situations. This is the last book I'm buying on the subject. I wish it was the first."
5,Illuminating!,"After decades of taking photos, I finally understand the behavior of light and shadows. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to light a subject, and do it correctly. I recommend it to anyone who is involved in product or portrait photography. I want more!"
5,Kindle version not usable (now perfect),"I have both printed copy and kindle version, to be fair printed version is 5 star the kindle edition is 1 star. The printed copy is great no probs about that. Kindle version has one big problem, all the pictures inside are in B&W.; With this kind of book it is essential to see in color, else you would not understand the concept being discussed. I do not mind seeing image in B&W; for the Kindle device, but I expect to see images in color in the Kindle PC and other devices. Unless they change this to color getting the Kindle version just does not make sense.Update 5/7/2011: they updated the kindle version, i've downloaded to both android and ipad and is now colored. Really perfect. You just have to pay for the new one. Pricey but worth it."
4,"Its not suppose to be pantera,so get over it","I think its great that Dime and Vinny started something fresh,they were pantera anyways(not just phil).If it were pantera they would have reveled in the name for 20 years like Iommi with sabbath,but whats the point in that,time to move on.This music does have elements of pantera,some of the vocal's,solo's,etc.Although its more stripped down without all the doublebass and double riffing,which is fine.Compared to superjoint this rock's,instead of sounding like a drug induced idiot,which is all phil has turned into,Damageplan isnt afraid to venture out and try some new things.And he doesnt have to scream every other word to be a powerful vocalist.So let pantera go,they had there success and went they're seperate ways thats life.And yesterday don't mean S@#t."
5,Another Classic From Dimebag,The ghost of Pantera lurks on this album. Everyone should stop comparing Damageplan to Superjoint Ritual. Phil moved into an entirely different direction than Dimebag did. Dimebag is hands down the greatest metal guitarist of all time and I respect anything that man does to the fullest. Damageplan is a great CD. I am hooked on it. Yes the singer is different than Phil was but he ain't that bad. He is definetely a hardcore dude. I am very pleased with this album and I recommend this album to anyone who can fully appreciate good metal music!
5,Awesome new plan !,"As a Pantera fan for years with my favorites by far being Vulgar Display of Power & Far Beyond Driven, I was very impressed with this new plan. It took a little getting used to because Dimebag & Vinnie have a signature style & if you know of them you can pick out their work, but Phils vocals werent there. After listening to the first 3 or 4 tracks though, I got used to it & I like it alot! This is NOT Pantera but old school hardcore Pantera fans should really appreciate it & be into it. When I first got it, I couldnt make myself take it out of the CD player. I think this plan will stick & I cant wait to see them live ! GET THIS CD !"
2,Rebel Meets Rebel is a Better Token of Dime,"If you are a huge fan of Pantera like me and you want to check out more work from one of the greatest gitar players that ever lived, go with REBEL MEETS REBEL. Its got that Pantera beat and riffs to it but with a slight country twang. David Allan Coe (singer of Rebel Meets Rebel) is probably one of the most underappreciated songwriters ever. As much as I wanted to love DamagePlan, it still kinda sucks. If I didn't know who was in the band and heard it, I would have wondered why they got signed."
5,R.I.P. Dimebag Darrell,"The five stars isn't for this album, but for Dimebag. He was amazing and influenced and brought joy to tons of people. He wont be forgotten soon. This is rather shocking and sad news."
1,For Dummies?,"I admit that my ignorance caused my disappointment in this book. I feel that the title is misleading. To me, ""home"" recording has reference to merely transferring one recording to a different medium. This book is a bit too technical for me, and deals with aspects of recording that I consider more ""professional"" and not so amateurish as I understand ""home"" recording. My rating is based on the feeling that the book is inappropriate for me, although others may find it to cover exactly what they are looking for."
5,Excellent Reference on Wine Basics,"It is unfortunate that this book is currently out of print, although it is still worth the effort to locate a used copy. I really know very little about wines, except for a limited knowledge about Gallo. Because I was interested in learning about Italian wines, I sought a copy of this book. This book covers all of the basics, from how to take care of wine to the different types, and which ones go with what foods. I was surprised to learn that no wine goes well with artichokes, and if it were not for the book, I might have blamed the wine for the metallic taste that arises from that combination. Another impression feature of the book is its section on the world wine regions. Readers can learn much about the different types of wines grown around the world. Therefore, this is certainly a book worth reading before traveling and fully experiencing a culture."
4,"A very good tutorial book, however, needs to be updated.","I'm an old hand at Oracle Forms, having worked with it since version 1.3. When a friend recommended this book, I thought it would be another week wasted, glossing over the same old commands and explanations. I couldn't have been more wrong. Much to my suprise (and embarrassment) this book is chock-full-o'tid-bits. Even including a section (albeit brief) on how to integrate Developer Forms with other applications, like MS Word, and Excel. I do, however, have 2 complaints with the book: 1)The book was written with screens in Windows 3.11 instead of Win 95, this will do nothing but confuse the novice and 2)it is riddled with mistakes in the tutorials. My recommendations is to wait for a newer, cleaner release. Once it comes out, I believe you will be hard pressed to find a better tutorial to Developer Forms."
2,"Tutorials OK, but not a reference book","When I was new to Oracle Forms 2 years ago, this was the only book in the bookstore on Forms. I got it, but have used it only a half dozen times since then. As an experienced programmer, I need a reference book so I can look up, say, a trigger and what it means and under what conditions it fires. This book is unsuited for that kind of task, and so I have generally found this book not useful to me at all."
5,Start at the beginning of the series,"Before you read Spy, read the books in the Alexander Hawke series that proceed it. There are connections between characters that are built in the earlier books in the series that will help trememdously in reading Spy. Ted Bell is my favorite fiction author, but I started with his first book, so the others are more enjoyable when they are read in sequence. I really enjoyed Spy. The diverse settings and subplots really kept me turning the pages. I enjoyed the introduction of new characters like the sheriff from Texas. I found him to be very believable. I hope Mr. Bell is working on his next book because I am eager to find out what Alexander Hawke has been up to."
1,Awful. Terrible. Awful.,Bell would have us believe that the Mexican army is invading the usa (????) and that there are water buffalo in the Amazon. And that we think that the author is clever. Nope.
3,Interesting plot and characters but...,"This book has an original and fascinating plot premise, i.e. that there's an alliance between left-wing, anti-American types in Latin-America, Mexicans who want to reclaim the Southwest, and Islamic fanatics. There are some amazing characters and plot trailers that I won't spoil for you. However, there are some amazing blunders as well, e.g. place names in Spanish and Spanish names for everything in Portuguese-speaking Brazil. Sometimes plot details are ridiculous even by ""techno-thriller"" standards, e.g. sneaking whole Mexican military divisions across the border. So I have to give this book which should have been better a rating of just three stars."
2,Way too general,"This dictionary may be good for the layman, but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer. Only the most common legal words are included, so most of the words are familiar to lawyers. Those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included. I would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms, but not to a lawyer or law student."
3,Several VERY GOOD cuts,A laid back style that is easy on the ears. I find it to be very relaxing and good music for traveling. Sound quality is great for car audio systems.
5,Heart stopping,"When I read this book it was the best inspirational resding I have had since my Grandmother past. It was truly a God send book. I was turned on to it by someone else who was walking through Books a million and the sales girl reccommended ""Walk With Me"" by a new author. I was the best. I share it at work, with friends, and loved ones. Thank you D. La Smith"
4,well pleased,"for once I am really pleased with a purchace I've made for myself. I love the set and it performs well. I would have loved the lids to have been glass , but other than that I plan on having these for quite a long time."
3,Not what I thought,"This product is not as easy to clean as I anticipated. After my very first use with the pans the olive oil would not come off, even after washing multiple times, and has left a distinctive film on the bottom of the pans. I've tried all of the suggestions in the manual, but nothing has worked. The outside is still nice and shiny though. I should have gone with the cast iron instead."
5,love these pans,Ordered these on a recommendation from a friend and loved them. I was tired of the no stick and the black coming off so wanted to go with the stainless steel. These do a great job of heating evenly with no sticking and so far have not burned anything and have been easy to clean. The set I picked up is missing the dutch oven size that I use all the time but that is my fault. I intend to see if I can pick that up separately.
3,Cracks over time,I've had this set of pans for about 3 years. Many of my pans have held up well but do require quite a bit of elbow grease to keep from staining or tinting. I have found that Bartender's Keeper cleaner helps aid in this process. The reason why I chose to write this review is that my most often used saucepan (the larger one) suddenly developed a crack on the side of it about a year ago. I continued to use it but the crack has now created a whole and my saucepan and is utterly useless. The other pans have held up well so far but I would think twice before purchasing this set.
2,Sticky Skillets,"Used to have a pretty positive take on the Cuisinart brand before owning their products. Now I will never buy them again. We asked for a set of their cookware and a food processor for our wedding 2 years ago. The food processor bit the dust and the company won't do anything for me. The pans in our cookware set are tolerable, but the skillets stick to everything like glue. Horrible experience. I want to take a sledge hammer to them in the backyard, but the wife won't let me. Yet."
1,Not worth the price.,Instructions provided with planer stink. Planer blades had nicks. Chip deflector keeps falling off. Bigger problem: SNIPE !!!
4,Self-employed woodworker,"I have been a cabinet maker and woodworker for 23 Years. Having checked out and compared features with other brands, I was very impressed with Dewalt's 13 inch planer. I have been using a Dewalt 12 inch planer for a few years with no complaints. The 13 inch has several features that I like e.g.three knife cutter head, two speeds, more ergonomic hand wheel, assisted chip ejection, threaded collumns for a more rigid platform. When I unpacked the tool my excitement suddenly turned to despair. As noted by B. McCoy in another review, the packaging is inadequate to say the least. The planer weighs about 97 lbs. and the carton has no handles to assist in picking it up. The outside package looked damaged and, in fact, the planer's metal base was broked. I never actually got to run or test the tool. I returned it for a refund. I would strongly advise anyone against buying this planer until they figure out how to protect it for shipping."
1,Don't really know,"I ordered the planer 6 weeks ago, and I am still waiting. The e-mails and phone calls are too numerous to count. Hopefully it will arrive soon. I have a stack of oak just waiting to be fed through my new planer.Okay, it was back ordered, I understand that, and then it was back ordered again. Yeah, it finally ships, and then the trucking company can't find anything with that tracking number. I am still waiting for the replacement....the saga continues."
4,"The California Recall Campaign, 25 Years Ahead of its Time","The latest California farce reminded me of this (sadly, out-of-print) little gem. Spectacularly corrupt politicians, a conniving Dick Morris-style political consultant trying to slip unnoticed into New Jersey's lieutenant governorship, where state would law protect his salary from his three ex-wives' alimony demands, a stunningly beautiful political advisor who can distract and disorient the opposition simply by removing her fur coat - what more do you need? Okay, hot sex in a jetliner, there's that, too.Well, when the governor suddenly drops dead, and every nut you ever heard of decides to jump into the race, you get a refreshing antidote to all the screeds written by the Stephanopolouses and Morrises and Joe Kleins that populate the bestseller lists. Find a copy of this book, take it to the beach, and see how many of your favorite politicians you can spot."
2,Very lame,"I am a great fan of 50's and 60's sci-fi films. I have a large collection and thought I would add ""Gorgo"". The problem I have with this film is the man in the rubber suit. Now Godzilla was done in the same way but was very effective. It moved well and was quite believable. Not so for Gorgo. The man in the suit didn't know how to move at all. He often stood upright opening and closing his mouth like an idiot. Sorry to say but this is the worst man in the suit creature I have ever seen and this is coming from a man that loves these sort of films."
3,"Godzilla, Guv?","The Brits couldn't abide the Japanese having the world's only gigantic prehistoric two legged dinosaur destroying it's cities, so they dredged up one of their own. Jolly good show!"
4,Sci-fi,"An interesting movie from the period of black/white . Though I enjoyed it , it is not as good as the original Godzilla movies."
3,not right album cover,i order this item thinking it was the origanal album single cover.insted i got the generic deth-row one. not cool.
5,More than a monopod - a super walking stick!,"Very often you can't take a tripod, so this is the next best thing!I love this Monopod. I use it hard, it's my walking stick on hikes everywhere I go. The harder the hike, the more I need it. And with most any of my lenses (and especially my Canon 100-400mm zoom) it helps a whole lot in steadying my shot! I take it everywhere because I'm getting a little older, and hauling a big camera and lens around all day can be a workout. It also makes me feel (a little) safer, walking through the city with 2K's worth of camera equipment hanging around my neck.This thing is built well, solid, and simple to use. No problems, and if I ever loose it -- I'll get another right now."
5,Manfrotto 681B Professional Aluminum Monopod (Black),This is a rugged monopod and definitely does what it's intended to do... I purchased the 486RC2 compact Ballhead for this and a 488RC2 Ballhead for my tripod so I could take the camera off of one and connect instantly to the other without delay... I would recommend this to my friends... One of my co-workers is getting this one too..
5,This is true,Accurately describes what's going on in US and in twisted-minded heads of today's little Trotskis and Lenins.
5,A Favorite of Church Shooters Everywhere,"This book was apparently a favorite of Jim David Adkisson, who recently killed two people in a Unitarian Church here in Knoxville, Tennessee. Because people who disagree with your political views really are sick, aren't they?"
1,I agree but. . .,"Liberalism is unquestionably a diseased mind. When someone's motive for maintaining a viewpoint is public coercion, they cease to be a free individual and are operating under cultic conditioning. It is out of fear of offending the status quo that they lash out at opposition to the status quo. They know that the liberal magisterium is unforgiving and vindictive. However, when someone manipulates good rhetoric to support his Zionist cause by defining anti-liberalism as pro-Israel, that too is cultic conditioning."
5,Savage is right! Liberalism is a mental disorder !,"Dr. Savage is right when he says ""Liberalism is a mental disorder""....You can tell it just by reading some of the warped reviews of this book! As for Savage being ""anti-Mexican"" he's not he's ""anti-illegals"" If you read the book you will also see he mentions the non-mexicans who cross our borders like those Russian Terrorist's who killed those poor children a while back. No matter what the crazy liberals try to say Illegal immagration is a major cancer to our nation. And yes, I'm not sure how Dr. Savage feels about it but I think we should close off our borders with Canada as well! We don't need open borders in this day & age of terrorism! I don't care what color you are if you want to come here please do so legally and take up english as your language! If you haven't gotten any of Savage's book's then I'd suggest you order all three!"
1,narrow minded trash preaching to the converted,"A product like this is bound to provoke a strong either/or reaction. Either you lean toward right wing conservatism, and thus agree with Michael Savage to begin with (and give him 5 stars), in which case there's really not much of a point to reading this book, or you disagree with far right wing thinking, and find yourself insulted by him. Unfortunately for the closed minded followers of this crass, bullying ideologue, they are ignorant of the fact that the world is not always an either/or, black/white scenario. There are also many who fall outside of the ""liberal/conservative"" dichotomy. There are often nuances and shades of gray. But you'll never notice that if you insist on ridiculous stereotypes, such as the idea that ""liberalism"" is a mental disorder."
5,"Practical, idea generating, highly recommended resource.","A Field Guide To Using Visual Tools is a superb introduction to the practical applications of visual tools such as brainstorming webs, task-specific organizers, and thinking-process maps as part of the education curriculum process. Chapters include: The Mapping Metaphor; The Networking Brain and Mind; Webs of Creativity; The Organizing Mind; Thinking-Process Patterns; Thinking Maps for Reading Minds; and Change Patters. The text is enhanced with appendices on ""Thinking Maps Test Scores Summary"" and ""Reading Comprehension Using Thinking Maps by Marjann Ball"". A bibliography, Resources For Visual Tools, Index, and ""About the Author"" round out this practical, idea generating, highly recommended classroom education development resource."
1,The crappiest gay movie ever,The only thing that saves grace is the beauty of the two guys...it would have been a reward to have seen them fully naked at one point...Rent it do not waste your money!
2,Significant Disappointment,"I saw this film before its release, at the New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. It sticks in my mind still because of its trite, fully derivative, predictable, and tedious plot. I cannot recommend the film..."
3,Nice pretty boy escape,"Pretty guys semi-scantily clad. I know there's a point but no nudity, no sex, and bad dialogue/acting. Eye candy with a bit of emotional impact if you really stretch the isolation/others theme. Just good, silly fun"
5,On the Oceans of Eternity,I am very happy with my purchase. The condition of the book was described as 'Like New' and it arrived in pristine condition. I will be a future customer of this book source.
3,Not bad for plagarism,"While I enjoyed all of the books in the series, and this one is just as good as the first two, I was a little disappointed that Stirling felt the need to plagarize Lord Stanley Baker's screenplay for the film Zulu for almost the entire plotline to the ""O'Rourke's Ford"" storyline. Characters, dialogue and plot all come straight from the movie. The small joke at the end is not enough to justify this."
1,"Slow, pointless and completely aimless ending","The only reason I read this was to see how it ends - it is just a stupid ending and long descriptions to test your patience - of irrelevant things. If Raymond Chandler is 10, Rebus after reading this is a 1.5."
2,It just doesn't grip you enough,"The pace of this book is simply to slow. It doesnt grip , shock or intrigue the reader nearly enough. I just couldn't get myself to finish it.I read a few chapters, got bored -- read 'The Bourne Supremacy' by Robert Ludlum.I read a few more chapters, got bored -- read 'The Taking' by Dean Koontz.I read a few more chapters, got bored -- read 'The Da Vinci Code' by Dan Brown.I read a ... forget it, you get the picture right."
1,Disappointed,This product was recorded over and was not the right movie it was a gift for my dad i was very upset.
4,Great collection....,It is a very good collection. This one has Joanna on it which was featured in the movie Love Actually. The only reason not for the five star is the quality is good not excellent.
2,"Too much info in short articles, hard to follow.","I'm not a big fan of this book, it's very hard to follow. I think this is due to two reasons:1. They jam so much info into such a short article. They try to sum up an important event in just a page or two, so they don't give a lot of background on any of it.2. It's written by three different authors. I've noticed some of the articles are easier to follow than others. I can only guess it is related to their differing writing styles.If you are assigned to read this for school then I guess you'll have to. But if you're thinking about reading it just for your own information, there are probably better resources out there."
4,Agreed - very good video but short on tornados,"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this DVD 5 stars except on the point about tornados. There is one very good sequence in the video but the remainder of the tornado section is very sparse, especially compared to the time spent on other natural events. If you want tornados, I suggest finding another video."
5,Wonderful knife with a good feel.,"I have a fortune in knives, I always try new ones, just about all my knives are at the top end, Wurstoff Grand prix, etc. I tried this knife, it was the last one left so I gave it a try. It is great, elegant, good feel. I like the blade is thin and has a little bend when pressed. My other knives are stiffer. I think this has my sharpest blade, but my quess being thin, it may need sharpening a little more often, but that's just a guess. I will get more of this knife."
4,Freshness and flavor,"This mix has been a staple in my kitchen for years because it is versatile and delicious, but the local stores no longer stock many varieties of the Good Seasons salad dressing mixes. It is fresh when prepared in your own home and can be used for both dressings and marinades. The mix keeps for a long time in the package until you make it fresh. Try this one with red wine vinegar and canola oil, and use it on lots of salad types, not just a Ceasar salad. Experiment with the types of vinegar and oil! Order the box of 24 and share them with your friends."
5,I' m SOOOOOOOOexcited!!!!!,"This is the best ever of making a great Chicken Ceasar Salad! We have always found the bottled creamy dressings too thick and not tart ... I marinate chicken breats all day in the dressing, then grill them ... slice and top a tossed salad of romaine, shredded parm cheese and bacon ( we use bacon bits ) add coutons if you like them and you have a GREAT meal! If the dressing for the salad is too tart or not creamy enuf for you, you can mix with a creamy variety of Ceasar dressing, we use Marie's.I am SO VERY EXCITED to have found this on amazon.com as it can't be found anywhere here in North Florida! And at such a GREAT price! Yea!!!! :)"
3,Good but Getting Dated,"This is a collection of 8 essays taken from HBR back 15-20 years ago. The essays range from how to build a strategy around environmental sustainability to looking at the challenges of developing strategies for emerging markets and exploring corporate efficiency through synergy, parenting, and exploiting intrinsic capabilities. The foundational information is good, and many of the principles are time tested. On the counter, many of the companies used in the examples, like Enron and GE, have struggled or failed in the intervening years. The rise of the information age and internet communications have caused many of the lessons conveyed around the emerging markets (especially India) to become obsolete faster than could have been anticipated 20 years ago. In all, there are many better resources for the 21st Century manager, but if this is an area of interest, you may find the book somewhat interesting."
4,I like it more and more.,"I sent a note about this book two years ago and I'm sending another because I like it more and more. I've taken some golf trips recently and have used the Confidential Guide to point me in the right direction. Through this book, I've ""discovered"" some superb courses that I would not have found. And, to boot, said courses are quite often completely unhyped, friendly and unsnobby. If you get the chance to travel quite a bit and you like to find those hidden gems, then this is a great place to start."
2,Does not include Windows XP TabletPC edition!,"Although this PC has a nice combination of features and appears to be well designed, it is just running Windows XP pro.It does NOT come with ""Windows XP Tablet PC edition"", so I suspect that the ink and recognition features you might expect will be missing, or not up to the standard of a real ""TabletPC"".In addition, the stylus is very thin - more like a PDA stylus and is difficult to hold."
2,Waste - O - Money for anything beyond simple Email,"I cannot get this thing to work at all with my AT&T worldnet account. The off network set-up options (for SSL logins etc.) aren't in the setup options, or else don't work. I get SPAM just fine in outlook, but Spam Killer cannot connect to the mail server.I suppose this would be a good product for plain simple email Spam Filtering. but nothing beyond thatThe support is comical, with those autobot ask Jeeves kind of things that make you feel like your talking to a live person. Ask a complex question and it has ""techical difficulties"" and boots you off the chat session.And that update center thing is annoying. I happened to also have the McAfee Firewall progam (I do like that though), but It keeps displaying unauthorized network call alerts for the Update Center app, no matter how I configure it. You'd think Someone at McAfee would have tested SpamKiller with their other products."
1,Not worth the money or time to install,"After getting over 50 spam messages a day, I decided to purchase McAfee's Spam Killer - it was highly rated by PC Magazine. Unfortunately, after installing I have found that it is faster to remove the spam by hand.First, SpamKiller is s-l-o-w. I have a 1GHz computer with 700MB of RAM. Yet, it still took SpamKiller a little more than a day (26 hours) to process 1000 email messages. Plus, SpamKiller takes another three to five minutes to filter every new message sent to me.What's the end result, SpamKiller runs all the time. My CPU is peaked by running SpamKiller. Please don't waste your time with SpamKiller. There has to be a better solution."
1,Waste of money,"Being deluged with spam (daily ~ 30), I thought this might be a good utility to have. Was a total waste of money and time. The security center was totally annoying and kept popping up until I manually disabled it using msconfig. And configuring the tool for any other mail program other than outlook express is a pain. Besides, if you have already opened the mail program *before* the spamkiller, there's not much spam killing you can do. Finally uninstalled and just wrote some outlook rules to filter out everything but known e-mail addresses. Recently installed norton internet security, and it seems to have a much more sensible spam blocking option."
2,"Decent cookbook, not one I would buy again","There are a couple of recipes in here that are worthwhile, but not enough to justify the book. Do yourself a favor and get Pie by Haedrich.....much more comprehensive."
2,Poorly made,"My son is a huge Bob the Builder fan, so I was thrilled to see this item on the toy shelf. However, once we got it home I was very dissappointed. It is poorly made and constantly falls apart. My son is very frustrated with it. He really likes the vehicles that we purchased to go with it (Muck, Scoop and Lofty), but if I knew how poorly made the shelter was, I wouldn't have wasted the money. (The Vehicles are better quality)."
2,He's No Steven Saylor,"I was hoping that, after having devoured all of Steven Saylor's fantastic Sub Rosa series, that Mr. Roberts' novels would be good enough to give me my fix for Ancient Roman mysteries. Alas, his first novel in the SPQR series has turned me away. The writing is good, but the author spends too much time with ""info. dumping,"" the characters are sometimes poorly developed, especially the protagonist, and the reader can see the bad guys coming a mile away. Even the book's title offers a clue to the situation. Oh well, at least I tried."
3,"Strong on history, light on mystery ...",This is the first book in the SPQR series about a Roman investigator named Decius Caecilium Metellus. The story takes place in 70 B.C. during the rise of Julius Caeser. It provides more historical background than many mysteries set in the past. But he mystery itself is rather obvious and predictable.You learn quite a bit about social classes and the politics of the times. The mystery is more or less secondary and involves multiple murders and political corruption.I especially liked the glossary at the end of the book. I used it quite heavily for the first chapter or two.
3,Serviceable fluorescent light fixtuture,Adequate for a small home office. Good light (better be with four 32W lamps!) Easy to install if ceiling outlet is already there. Looks much better than a wraparound or any other kind of 4 foot fluorescent fixture with patterned acrylic lens.
5,Great movie for all ages,It may not be historically accurate but this adorable movie is worth watching. Great lessons about being yourself and having the courage to do what is right.
1,mediocre is being kind,"I'm sorry, but if you are going to watch this movie, you should be aware that it is a one star movie at best. The plot, the acting, is laughable. Really, you would love someone and then not recognize them? Very bizarre! I guess the morale is marrying for money is okay if you are pretty."
5,"MY ALL TIME ""SECOND"" FAVORITE MOVIE!","I say this is my second favorite movie because my very favorite is an old classic ""An Imitation Of Life"". I'm a pretty hard sell on movies, but I'm hooked on this one. I've tried in vain to find the soundtrack, namely, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, that is played at the end of the movie.....Roberta Flack, eat your heart out! I can't remember the name of the person who played Joseph Finnes sidekick but, they were equally Awesome!!. The only downside to this movie was the young lady who played the love interest, she just didn't do it for me acting-wise. And that is the ""ONLY"" downside to this movie. I Loved it, I Highly Recommend it!...Enjoy!!"
2,Answers the No Woman Thing,"Awfully slow moving today. When it came out, it may have been a Spielberg project, a technological piece, but it definity lacks the wonder of ET or the appeal of Star Wars. The teen kids will find it rather tame, the horror scenes, not even as weird as Harry Potter.Sherlock Holmes is best handled by the BBC. Holmes is sort of an early James Bond, almost a Union Jack superman without the need for female companionship. Hmmm?"
4,fantasy cloaked in mystery keeps you guessing!,"Spielberg's concept of how the young Sherlock Holmes might have begun his career is a real thriller. Hallucinogenic-inspired fantasies, real life Victorian settings and a story that would make Sir Doyle proud all combine to create a unique whodunit.Good family entertainment? Elementary."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"I am by no means a fan of Sherlock Holmes, but being that this was a collaboration between Spielberg, Columbus, & Levinson, I had to give it a shot. They make it clear from the beginning that everything is speculation, nothing comes from the works of Arthur Conan Doyle and that the whole premise of the movie is as a tribute, one I think he would have been very happy with. The story is a classic Holmes mystery and showing them as kids instead of well established investigators gave the story a whole new life. It's a fresh perspective on Sherlock Holmes that I really enjoyed."
3,Just OK,"Hardly a year goes by that something doesn't come out to capitalize on the Sherlock Holmes name. If you are a person who feels compelled to have everything to do with Holmes, then this should be in your collection. Note that it contradicts the A. Conan Doyle account of the first meeting of Holmes and Watson. There is one scene, ""Holmes is going to solve a crime!"" which I thought was great. Much of the film, though, I thought was too contrived, and there is a fairly well known riddle which is brought up now and then during the film. All in all, I am unsure as to whether or not I would rate this a ""buy""."
4,what great fun,"A must see for the kiddos. I didn't have high hopes for this film, but it was beautifully done. It's definitely a kid flick though, and it looks nothing like what Sherlock Holmes life would have looked life as a kid, if you are familiar with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's work with the character at all. It's modern day and light-hearted. If you have tweens or younger, this is a non-threatening and non-scary film. Great for the whole family. Recommend!"
2,ChemTutor,This software would have been great 10 years ago. Now it is litle more than an online test which can be obtained free at many chemistry websites. This is not worth what I paid for it. It would be a great ... product because it gives you practice taking chemistry tests IF you already know the subject very well.
1,NOT SO INSPIRED,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It had very little detail, each of the stories was only about a page and a half and there were no pictures. I felt like a was reading a bunch of little snippits, nothing substantial. I had looked forward to a book that would provide inspiration and motivation and felt that this book did neither."
3,Win the Fat War: 145 Real Life Secrets to 100% Weight Loss,"I saw this book referred to on the Oprah Show and thought it would be a great inspirational tool to have around while battling the weight. When I received this book I was impressed with the success stories it contain, but was terribly disappointed that there were no pictures of the people who had successfully won the battle. It is always more inspiring to see what a change there is in people once they have lost their unwanted pounds. Great stories, but would have been much better if they would have contained before and after pictures."
1,This book is extremely bad.,"Model Rocketry is regulated by the federalgovernment (BATF), the National Fire Code,state and local laws, and the Model RocketSafety Code. All of these expressly forbidconversion of model rockets into explosivedevices.Model Rocketry is a reputable world-widehobby and sport, and books like this areharmful to the continued ability of modelrocketry hobbyists to legally purchase andfly model rockets"
4,Writer's Digest Reviewer says:,"""In ""The Last Street Fighter"", Mr. Normis gives his readers a firsthand view of what it was like growing up in the less than desireable neighborhoods of L.A. His courage is to be commended. He portrays the fight-to-survive life to perfection. I believed that using his fists to protect himself and his family became a necessity ... the writing is sound.""""I am most impressed with the author's passion ... This is a well written book that allowed me into the world where I have never set foot. The author's faith shines through, from the crosses on the cover to the inside pages."""
1,c'mon!!,"I agree with some of the others who posted. To the credit of the book/those who enjoyed it, maybe it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, but c'mon, dont post it allover amazon. I was checkiubg out snoops new album reviews and I get referred to this?!!"
1,Very Funny,"I went looking for information on a Slayer album titled ""God Hates Us All"" and some-body reccomended this book instead of the album. Now, I am not amused. Must Christians always seek to stick their noses in where they aren't wanted? If I wanted a book on christianity, I'd have looked for one."
1,enough missionary work,"I saw that some other reviewers were angry to find that this book was popping up as a recommendation alongside dozens of metal bands' releases, but I found this after looking up Lil Jon's ""Crunk Juice."" The unfortunate thing about Christianity it seems, is that there's this dogged adherence to a single truth in the midst of countless others. And why, Christians, do you believe in that one, single, unwavering, and pure truth? Because you were born that way, because you were raised that way, and because it's frightening and infuriating to contemplate being any other way. Fine, be that way, but quit trying to ""reach"" people through misleading Amazon Recommendations and go back to your annoying and fallacious arguments."
1,Pathetic,"So I come to look at cds by Dio, and suddenly I see this dumb book listed as ""buy this instead"". Someone needs to leave music listeners alone. Realize that just because someone listens to rock it doesnt mean they worship Satan. And if they do, then they probably don't care what you have to say. Stop being dumb. What you have said to buy instead has no relation to our music.Nobody is going to read this book because you suggest it instead of music. At all. Stop trying. You're a failure at life....if youre trying to convert everyone, what i find most ironic is that people that bought this book typically bought books by Dan Brown, possibly the most heretical books to come out in some time..."
1,I am very frustrated with this book,"I have practiced for several months and then I went to dance, just to find out that most of the info I have read it was all wrong. Especially the tango steps. Sorry for this comment but that is what happened to me."
1,Stupid from the opening phone sex scene...,"Some of the best movies that I have seen I have bought in the used 4 for $20 bin at BlockBuster. You can't beat the deal, but you have the take the chance on a few bad ones in with the good.This is one of the bad ones. A weak story, too many cliches', and a setting that we have seen many times before (although not in the form of a castle in the middle of the desert).The good: The main actress looked great in those low cut pants. The Lows: Too many!Plot Question: How did Frank get from the castle to the shack so fast?"
1,Terrible,I really wish I could give this less than a single star rating but.....Under no circumstances rent this movie.
1,Ummmm...wow....,"The movie cover gives this movie wayyyyyyyyy too much credit. I honestly saw the box and figure it had to be good because of the front cover. Boy, was I wrong!!! My fiance wanted to continue watching it, which I felt was a punishment for something I must've done to him. The girls acting truly sucked!!! Big time!!! It was ridiculous!! I bought this movie for $5.00 at Walmart and I am really sad I can't get my money back."
1,A SHORT MOVIE YOU WISH WAS SHORTER,"I love a good horror movie. With the emphasis on GOOD. This one is anything BUT good. Granted, the first 10 minutes or so (when the bus is found on a dark dirt road) has some good tension and scares. But after that, the movie hits rock bottom. Our two ""victims"" spend most of the next day taking their time to look around this castle they are driven to, all while talking about going ""clubbing"" together once this ordeal is over. Come on already. Get scary! Nope. It isn't to be. And what scares they TRY to hit you with at the end of the movie are laughable. A sad excuse for a horror movie. Skip this one, save your money and time."
1,BURY THIS ONE,Truly abysmal attempt at film-making! The semblance of a script is horrible...no one is guilty of good acting...it makes no sense at all..it's really a bad movie. Avoid!
2,"Buy just the book, opt out of the cd","I think the book is available by itself. Buy just that. I am a native speaker and I bought this for a friend who wanted to learn Tagalog. I then listened to the CD and was appalled, APPALLED, at the butchery. The accents on the CD are ATROCIOUS and you would get laughed off the sidewalks of Manila if you spoke like the people on this CD; the women are shrill and campy and the men speak in an unnatural monotone. Buy the book, which in itself is a good introduction, but find a conversation partner to read the text to you."
2,works but one click results in multiple signals,Press it one time and the garage starts to open then shuts. Pretty annoying when you have to try multiple times. But at least it was cheap
1,Horrible product,This item doesn't work!! I would NOT buy it.. I bought two of them and I am having the same problem with both. Half the time it works and the other half it doesn't work at all!
2,Should give out more details,PROS:- Fast deliveryCONS:- Does not work with my system. More details need to be addressed so buyers can decide it is the right one for their system or not.
1,Didn't work with my Craftsman Door Opener and made a mess,This thing messed up the programming for everything else and didn't work to make things even worse. Don't buy this for a Craftsman Opener.
1,Did not really work,We got this remote to work a little bit but we had to be so close to the garage door for it to work and sometimes it worked and sometimes it did not. We got tired of trying to get it to work that we ended up buying a different one for $25. So it is worth it to pay a little extra and get a good remote that will work instead of getting this one!
1,Waste of Time - Unusable,"Back here to return this waste of time. A list of annoyances you'll probably want to avoid:1. Doesn't work with many models, including mine. If it does work though, setup is insanely annoying!2. The door to open the jumpers is extremely hard to open. Jumpers are a pain in the butt to change.3. Direction is INSANELY overdone and confusing. Think of opening a mac product, then think of the complete opposite of that.RETURN."
2,BAD COLLECTION,"I purchase all of these spagetti western collections I can find ,however this one is a let down most of the films have very bad video and audio and are not that good of a movie anyway,at least one film Beyond The Law keeps switching back and forth from English to Italian ,most of the better films here are included on other better collections."
4,A very well-thought out book.,"On a recent trip to Spain, my travelling companion had this book; I had a different one, and spent much of the trip trying to buy another copy of this one.It's a very nicely laid-out book. The dictionary lay-out (it's arranged like a spanish-english/english-spanish dictionary, with useful phrases being listed along with the main word in the phrase), rather than a more tradiional phrase-book layout, made it very easy to find what was needed `on the fly'. The choice of words and phrases in the book was excellent for a traveller; by being careful in what was included, the authors managed to make a pretty complete book thats easily small enough to fit in a pocket. The introductory sections on the basics of the language were very useful; the menu reader in the back was great.For someone who didn't know any Spanish to speak of, I was very happy with this books ease of use, small size, and low price."
4,"Very good, but not great","In other circumstances, I'd give this 5 stars. It's just that it's not nearly as good as the first Section album, that for some reason has never been re-released. That one, featuring Michael Brecker on sax, is in my view THE best (and one of the first) ""fusion"" albums of the 70s, and frankly one of the best albums ever made."
4,Kids love to dress up.,"The glass has a built-in tint that's a little distracting and they aren't exactly one-size fits all, but who cares! The kids love em and had a blast playing pretend and loved to show off to their friends that the glasses had the Harry Potter insignia on the side. Worth the money and worth the fun."
3,Alright..,"While they are made well enough, they are quite small. They didn't fit my face too well and looked a bit funny. Granted, these are presumably meant for children, so I'm not all that surprised. If you're an adult looking for harry potter glasses, these probably aren't for you."
5,I love these pencils,If you're looking for pencils that can make nice smooth dark lines and are nice for shading then these pencils are perfect. You can't go wrong with these pencils for this price.
3,interesting,"A very interesting read. However, the author fails to explore the truth about Castro in enough depth - mainly, why he continues to murder and oppress his own people in what's supposed to be ""socialist paradise"" (in quotations since 'socialist paradise' is most definitely an oxymoron)."
5,One of the BEST READS of the year,"It's all about the voice. The remarkable voice of Trixie Jordan who starts the novel by telling you that ""When I was twelve, a fortune-teller told me that my one true love would die young and leave me all alone. Everyone said she was a fraud, that she was making it up...I'd really like to know why the hell a person would make up a thing like that."" See what I mean. I loved this book. I read it so fast, I gulped it down. And then when I got to the end. I started all over again."
2,This is why I don't read many novels anymore...,"It was a quick read and kept me interested BUT it read like a 12 year old girls angsty fantasy. There is nothing surprising about it, and the conflicts are ridiculously overblown. They have fights over nothing, and somehow it becomes an insanely dramatic affair and that is supposed to equal the tumultous romance described on the back of the book. I left this book not liking anyone, not finding depth in anyone, and not really seeing any of them as someone I could ever actually meet in the real world. I can't even quite figure out why they are THAT connected, it seems to me like they share about what a serious but non-lasting couple would have not the kind of thing you'd expect SOUL MATES to have."
1,for the sullen 14-year old in your life,"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at how overwrought and predictable this book was -- the author wrote the equally overwrought/predictable movie Dream For An Insomniac. Regardless, everything about this book just worked my nerves, from the main character Trixie (who, though incredibly self-obsessed, gives no real evidence of having an inner life or an interest in cultivating one), to her ill-fated boyfriend (the stock brilliant, brooding Kurt Cobain/James Deansian rebel) to the equally generic Shallow Parent Characters. The simplistic way the author writes her characters and dialogue would be acceptable in a teen novel, but in one ostensibly for an adult audience is either laughable or cringeworthy. Actually, both. Save your money..."
3,worth it for the hits,"i bought this because two of my favorite three rap songs ever were naughty by nature songs, the undeniable anthems ""hip hop hooray"" and ""o.p.p."" they also had the lesser hit ""everything's gonna be alright"" which included the immortal (and hard-to-argue) line, ""if you ain't nevah BEEN to tha ghetto, don't evah COME to tha ghetto, 'cuz you wouldn't underSTAND the ghetto."" and plus, i just need more quality rap music (without having too much, mind you). i like these guys, what they stood for: you got your streetwise gangsta-element, and your catchy, danceable, pop grooves in one package. no more pretending to like NWA, hooray! sadly, only about half of this greatest hits package is worth listening to, but then again, that's a pretty damn fine ratio for a best-of compilation in this genre."
5,The Finest Nature Could Possibly Produce,"Naughty had huge hits on each one of their first three albums and this CD is a testimony to that fact. Anthems like OPP, Feel Me Flow, Hip Hop Hooray, and Craziest have proven that they're a ground breaking power in the culture of Hip Hop. Do yourself a favour and get this album. Naughty by Nature keep it slammin into the next millenium."
1,"A well-written, easy-to-read, tremendously dangerous book.","Herb Schildt finds a wide audience among new C programmers, mostly due to his amicable writing style and clear, logical organization. While these qualities would be desirable for most books, they are what make ""C: The Complete Reference"" such a danger. Much of the information that Herb so eloquently gives is by and large tripe; many examples in this book demonstrate a lack of understanding of some of the most basic points of C. The result is an entertaining, rip-snorting read that leaves the reader dazzled, thirsty for more, but none the wiser (and thoroughly misinformed) in terms of the C programming language. This book is to be avoided at all costs, and is unfortunately typical of most modern C books."
2,Entry in the Jargon File,"I have no personal opinion, not having read this, although the negative comments sound reasonable...besides, you should always take a reference with a grain of salt (I wanted to rate ""-"", but was forced to select a rating). But the term Bullschildt has INDEED made it into the Jargon File.Entry:bullschildt: /bul'shilt/, n.[comp.lang.c on USENET] A confident, but incorrect, statement about a programming language. This immortalizes a very bad book about C, Herbert Schildt's C - The Complete Reference. One reviewer commented ""The naive errors in this book would be embarrassing even in a programming assignment turned in by a computer science college sophomore.""But just because there are naive errors doesn't mean it wouldn't be useful to somebody even more naive."
4,A Really Well Written Book on C,"C The Complete Reference is one of the best books available in market for C language. Good cover of concepts,good examples and explanations.This book offers you everything you need to be a good programmer using C language. Izmir Institute of Technology has chosen this book as a reference for all classes related in computers and programming languages."
2,2 stars,"I wanted so much to like this book because it sounds good but Brockway made the fatal mistake of trying to write a witty character. When this fails it's a catagory: Epic.Saying a character is witty and clever and then never giving any evidence to it is my pet peeve. It's such a let down. Don't get me wrong, it is HARD to write. Humor really is the hardest genre and witty dialogue takes talent. I get this. But if you can't do it, don't do it."
2,Did I read the same book as the other reviewers?,"I'm sorry, I just did not think this book was anywhere near the quality that Connie Brockway usually writes. I enjoyed the book up until about page 300. After that it went to ""pot"". The storm scene was ridiculous - (...) Everything just fell into its perfect place. I thought the trial was absurded. (...)I think the ending would have been better if (...) but then that is not how romance writers write. I expected much better from Ms. Brockway than this.I must say I did laugh-out-loud at (...)and a few other times though."
2,Heroine is a identity thief- it's hard to put a good slant on that.,"I thought I would like this book after reading the reviews and I have liked other Connie Brockway's books, but I just could not connect with this story line. I can like a heroine who is flawed and has personal growth but I just did not like Letty, maybe it is because she was a lair and identity thief, or maybe because it was a boring book."
5,just right,"I have used other collars for other larger dogs and they have worked well eliminating or controlling some unwanted behavior. However, these collar made for ""bird dogs"" would seem to be too excessive. This collar is sized right and worked equally well"
1,Flaky Response,"Having followed the instructions to the letter, this would refuse to respond, by shock or tone, and even immediately after re-pairing it to the receiver would be variable like that. I see from the reviews that other people have had the same issue. I returned it. Amazon's returns policy is excellent, as always.If you do wish to try this, note that although it says little dog remote trainer, it has a large collar and there will be a lot of excess on it. I hadn't trimmed it to length (it warns to be careful you don't cut the antenna) and it was still flaky in response."
1,Poor product,"This training collar has a very limited range to continue working. It went through batts frequently, without being used to train. The collar training device shut off on its own and would not be effective when needed. Would not recommend this, look at another."
5,Worked great for our Beagle,"We have a very stubborn beagle which up to this point has thwarted all of our efforts to train him. By nature, he is a constant barker and quickly learned to bypass the citronella spray collar and was right back to barking. He's also a food hound and can often be found counter surfing. Once we purchased this collar, it wasn't long before he realized his howling days were over...not to mention the counter surfing as well. The only downfall is that the batteries ran out rather quickly, so I'd suggest ordering extras. Although, he's been on his good behavior even though the collar hasn't been on...we just need to keep it on hand though, because it's only a matter of time before he reverts to his old antics."
2,Works half the time,"It works half the time. Requires frequent resets. Eats through CR2032 batteries. Warn with tone first, then shock if necessary. After a day or two they will associate one with the other so you will be able to just use the tone. But be ready to reset the thing fairly frequently, and buy a cheap pack of CR2032s because you'll need them."
3,It works...,"So I read the reviews first. I got it and it worked for about a week before the batteries died. Walmarts jewelry counter sells the batteries. It worked again for a while... Then only the tone worked. Took it to the local pet store and they replaced it for me. Lol Only real issue is that it goes dead quickly... But I have a very stubborn dog and I use it a lot... So I suggest just stocking up on the batteries that you will need. Other than that, it's been a good assistant in training the dog. he definitely knows what he isn't supposed to do because of this tool. I started out verbally disciplining when I engaged the collar. Now I can just look at him and he knows to stop what he is doing.he is only 6 months old with more specific training needed before full maturity. I am pleased to have this progress in the <2 months as I don't like to yell at the dog or kids.Amazon.com sells this much less than the big pet supply stores, which helps if you are going to buy a few packs of batteries."
1,Terrible range,"I had high hopes for this collar. Simply does not work past 30 feet. I thought the batteries were defective so I put new ones in and still the same result. Also, if I'm in range there's a pause between the time I hit the zap/sound button and when it registers on the collar. I bought this trainer after I bought the Petsafe's no bark collar which happened to work perfectly."
4,Buzz,It works well. I like the sound option as well as the buzz option. I do understand how some complain about the battery life. With us it lasts 2-3 weeks.
4,Effective,"This product has been very effective. We have a jack russel/rat terrier mix who doesn't bark, but jumps and likes to chew things. It only took a few days to break him of being in things he shouldn't be, we still have some problems with chewing on stuff, but that has improved as well! After all, he is only 7 months old and it takes time to train. But the product does work well. We do have to use the large prongs for it to work on him, but he has a thick coat too."
2,Dog collar,The item doesn't seem to work properly. If I take out the batteries and reinstall it will work for a day or two. It might be a defect but I'm hate trying to return things. This item should have been bought locally for easy return.
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this and two weeks later it stopped working. It was the cheapest one on Amazon, and I can see why!"
3,"Delivery took way too Long, but an overall Good product","The main issue I had with this purchase is the time it took to be delivered. The seller had already charged me for the purchase and it showed having been sent, however when I tried to track the package a few days later, it showed it had only been initialized, not actually dropped off or picked up by USPS yet. So it took about a week longer than originally quoted to arrive. I even had to email the buyer to ask them about the status of the purchase at one point, but it eventually arrived and I've been generally satisfied with it since. The battery dies fairly quickly on the remote.. after only a few uses. I've learned to remove the battery if I know I won't be walking her the next day. Otherwise, works well and I'm glad you can lower the settings so much."
3,Does the job but be careful.,"I've had the collar for a little more than a week. The collar took some resizing so that it would shock the dog when I pressed the button but it works every time now. I use the buzzer now more then the shock button (he's getting smarter). But I'm always careful when I use the shock button because it gets stuck and continuously shocks my dog until I finesse the button back to its normal position. Also, he's getting the wrong message of why I'm disciplining him when I shock him. That's my fault though. I should have educated myself before I started training."
2,Buttons don't work,"I received the item as promised.When I put it all together, and then put the collar on myself first, the buttons (sound) did not work even thou the light flashed to indicate that it was on. It finally made the sound after pressing the button several times. I then put the 'dial' on 1 to see what the shock would feel like. It was only a little zap (after presseing the button a few times again)...hardly felt it. Number 2 did the trick, I even jumped a little, didn't expect it, since it actually worked on the first push of the button.I then went ahead and put it on my 21 lb' mix (JRT & Pug). I gave the command to 'leave it' and then pressed the 'sound button'. After pressing it again a couple of times the sound finally worked. My puppy just looked around, since now she was already on to sniff at something else. After a few try's I finally took it off my dog. The delay of the sound button was enough to drive me crazy. I'm returning the item today."
1,"unreliable, eats batteries like candy","Collar works when it wants too, and goes through so many batteries that I can barely afford to use it. beep sounds different every time I use it."
1,bored,"Why is this book so expensive? It's 142 pages long! I was very disappointed with the length and the content. The stories were short, and boring. What could have been a good story line, ended up as mush, like the women."
5,Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2006 Edition,The Oppenheim's have a talent for picking the best products new and classics. Their critiques are to the point and wonderfully descriptive. As a dad who likes to waste as little time as possible their guide is a lifesaver!
2,I don't think this book is worth it.,"I don't think this book is worth it. Why? Because so much of this information is free from other moms. They have the experience. These people just write about it. What is that saying: Those who know, do it. those who don't write it?A few moms in our play group mentioned how sad they were that some of the toys they bought their kids for Hannukah (based on this book) are stuck on the shelf already and what a waste of money that was. I have to agree with another reviewer about the SNAP awards too. There is no infomation at ALL in the book that explains what they are, what they mean or even how they came up with them. I think this book lacks credibility and it is nothing more than a ploy to get you to spend more money. Do manufacturers pay them to list their toys, I wonder."
5,Excellent concise explanation of Baha'i teachings,"Even though published in 1951, this 103 page book is eminently readable, with the well arranged subjects presented in a conversational manner. It is not excessively dated in its references. The writer, although very erudite, presents the material in a manner that is suitable for readers from teenagers to ancients.There are 10 chapters- What will tomorrow bring, There was a Man (regarding Baha'u'llah), A world at Peace, A New World Order, Solution of the Economic Problem, Prejudice Must Go, One World-One Language,Science and Religion, Education, This Century of Radiance.The quotations chosen from Baha'i writings are those which are very easy to understand, none lengthy and esoteric.In my estimation, Tomorrow and Tomorrow is still one of the best explanations about the Baha'i Faith in brief form."
3,What you should know before you buy,well the price of the unit is cheap but the label tape is expensive. it advances the tape more than necessary before and after the label which ends up being about an inch of wasted tape per label.it can do two lines on the smallest text setting but aligns to the left side.the labels can be hard to peel as there is no feature to help you peel them whatsover.BIG plus as you can see its standard qwerty setup. it's easy to use.
1,For $0.29 I'd give it 4 stars,"I just got this machine and liked it right away, until I tried to peel the backing off the tape. I have short fingernails and I found it virtually impossible to get it off without mutilating the tape. I figured I must be missing something so I checked the Brother's website. Turns out, they sell a little piece of plastic called a ""Peel stick"" for 29 cents that was supposed to make it easy to take the backing off. I find it incredible that they will sell these labelers for as much as they do and not include this $0.29 piece of plastic! Judging from other comments on this forum some people don't have a problem with this, but personally, I would suggest at looking elsewhere for a labeler"
4,You don't have to read the directions,"I love it when I can pick up a product and start using it without reading the instructions! I have yet to read the instructions and it is really easy to use. Great for the office for lables, etc and at home if you're as organized as Bree Van De Kamp on Desperate Housewives, you can lable to your heart's desire.A few notes: They have various lable tape colors. It's not as cool as you'd think. I really like the white. Easier to read. I've tried a few others and I'm not all that pleased. Also, it would be helpful if they'd make a ""super-sticky"" version of the tape. If the surface you're applying it to is rough or at all porus, you'll have trouble. No hesitation however, about recommending this."
4,Handy Little Thing Makes Life Easier,"Bought this handy little labeler -- which makes full sized labels -- almost 4 years ago at tax time. Including a spare tape, got change back from a twenty -- you do the math. Tapes are a generous length and battery life exceeded my expectations. (Caution: Lettering fades if used on outdoor equipment.) I have personally recommended this labeler to about a dozen of my co-workers."
4,Great Product,What a great product for the money. Had another product before that would never work. So far this one has made many lables with out one failure. For the money it is great. I do agree that the peeling of the lable after cutting is a little hard but can be done with a little work. Maybe we can ask them to fix this small problem. For the cost four stars...!!
2,121.99 is NOT the correct price for this!!!,It is 28.99 at Office Depot- they probably mean 21.99!!!But I have had one for a year and it no longer feeds the tape correctly-
1,"It is NOT ""The music you heard on the Sopranos""","This is an extremely opportunist release which must be running close to the wind in terms of trades description regulations. Dreadful covers by clearly clapped-out session musicians without any love left in their hearts, either for the show or for the fans who, like the fool that I am, may have been tempted to buy this follwing on from the previous two genuine soundtrack albums - fine records they are too. This is utterly tasteless and horribly packaged by people who, ironically enough, are no strangers to the concept of the 'shakedown'. Do NOT buy this piece of junk if you intend doing so because you are a fan of the show and its music - precious little what you'll hear here ever appeared on it nor ever would appear in ANY self-respecting person's stereo."
1,Music You Heard on the Sopranos - UGH!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a huge disappointment. I'm very disappointed in how this product is marketed and advertized. It's very deceptive. It lists all the songs and the ORIGINAL artists and nowhere on the packaging does it say that these songs are performed by other than the original artists. Silly me, I actually expected this to be the the acutal music I heard on the Sopranos by the ORIGINAL ARTISTS! Instead, it's just a B grade version of the songs performed by wannabees. I really hope that I can get a refund for this. This is the worst Christmas present I have ever purchased from Amazon!"
2,Drivel,"Absolutely uninteresting, I'm returning it. Over the years, I've bought, oh probably like a dozen of these books (from this series, I mean) and, with the exception of Managing High-Tech Enterprise, found them completely unhelpful and uninteresting. Always self-contradictory, unintelligent, and droning, they remind me of the ""self-help"" book genre -- which is to say, politically-correct, vapid tripe that the publishers probably believe will sell in any quantities and no matter how bad, simply because people look forever for advice and will probably buy and keep buying. Very disappointing; I'm through with this series."
4,"""Batty"" and the Beast","The story is about how the Joker needs to help a powerful alien being to ""ease"" his physical pain, in return for having absolute power over everything. In order to ""cure"" the alien, he needs to blast the alien with a huge dose of gamma radiation. And what better source to use than the Hulk himself? Among the action in the book, we get to see how Batman takes down the Hulk. Wonder how he did it? read the book to find out; I won't spoil the story here. Overall, the book is fun to read, but not a must buy."
3,Good looking but not accurate,"I bought this watch for 2 months and i started to notice i have to adjust the watch about every 2 weeks,it runs too fast....every 2 weeks, it's fast about 2minsi used to have a seiko, but not having this problemI dont know if that's normal or notbut apparently, accurate should be the most important thing on automatic watch...especially for a $2000 value watch...i hope it's normal...cause nobody want to fix their new watch within 2 months.."
3,Is this a real tag?,Don't own this but am curious if it is a real TAG. Doesn't look like it. From searching the internet it seems like a licensed replica.Would love to know.
5,A Book That Challenges the Spirit & the Mind,"Think & Grow Rich: A Black Choice reaches far into the pysche of the individual to awaken the potential dormant within. This book generates a different prospective of the subliminal self and existence. It is a book for ANYONE who wants to accomplish greatness by CONCEIVING, BELIEVING, and ACHIEVING!"
1,WHY,"THINK AND GROW RICH: A BLACK CHOICE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY MY BROTHER HAS NOT RECEIVED HIS BOOK THAT WAS ORDER ON NOV 30 2012. I WANT TO KNOW WHEN IT WAS SENT,WHO SIGNED FOR IT IF IT BEEN SENT. THIS IS REALLY MAKING ME LOOK BAD. THANKS FOR NOTHING"
3,good product but tastes too tart,"I have had other cal-mag drinks such as this with vitamin C in them, this however has too much C in it I think. The drink tastes like ascorbic acid powder, which if you've ever had it before you know will make your mouth pucker quite a bit. I couldn't even disguise it in juice. I bought it because at $8 a can that's a great price but not at the cost of taste. It's okay as a cal-mag product but the taste is so awful it's hard to confront taking it everyday like I need to."
1,Misleading,The description says 4 sets. They sent one. I wrote to them and never received an answer.
2,Blurred & Smeared,Not very impressed with this product. They leave smears and residue all over the lens. I am already looking for replacements.
4,very wet,"Recently they have more liquid than previously, which leaves streaks at first but it still evaporates quickly enough. CVS and other brands have less fluid, so evaporate more quickly. Since these have alcohol, I use them also as disinfectants, so I like the extra fluid."
2,Not as good as they used to be,"I have been ordering these every couple of months for the past 3 or 4 years and I have to say that the last couple of orders have been disappointing. Many of the packets are too dry and I am lucky to be able to clean one lens sufficiently let alone both lenses of my glasses. Often I have to open a second packet to complete the job. On rare occasions I strike it rich and open a packet that is sufficiently moist to clean both lenses.As someone else mentioned, something has has changed with the formula over the years and it is not good."
1,Sight Destroyers,"I only wear glasses to read and I can't see squat (to put it mildly) whenever I try to clean them withBausch & Lomb Pre-Moistened Lens Cleaning Tissues, Box Of 100 - Packaging May Vary. These wipes only smear up your lens and make the situation worse.The best wipes are InstaClears which are available where eyeglasses are sold."
2,Another author with a religious agenda,"I was very disappointed to see that this was another author with a religious agenda. Some of the suggested activites were cute and sweet, others were just plain common sense. The author's credibility was lost when he chose to include his own religious beliefs which has nothing to do with being ""Your Daughter's Daddy"""
3,"Looks good, but...","I purchased these VentVisors to replace damaged visors on 1997 Ford F150. Installation was not difficult, and they look good, but I am not convinced that they will adhere to the felt as well as the originals adhered to the outer painted surface."
4,Shipboard mystery,"The Spirit of '98, a small cruise ship, sets sail up the Inside Passage of Alaska to commemorate the Gold Rush of 1898. Alex Jensen and his girlfriend Jessie Arnold are aboard as official representatives of the State of Alaska. Alex is looking forward to a leisurely cruise, but his police skills are called into play when some valuable items are stolen from several staterooms. Soon the problems compound when a dead body is found in the water and one of the crewmembers disappears. In the meantime, 2 men have stolen a sailboat and later a powerboat to commit a crime which is unknown to them. Eventually the two story lines merge and the entire ship is threatened by a diabolical plot. Alex untangles the mystery and sets out to save the ship from imminent danger. Sue Henry can always be counted on for wonderful descriptions of Alaska interwoven with an intriguing mystery."
1,"5 stars for the book, 1 star for kindle transcription...","the kindle translation is full of randomly bolded words (over 20 a page on some pages). It finally got annoying enough I gave up trying to read it on the kindle. The publishers really should have someone do a final quality check before just dumping it on the market.After several hundred e-books, this is by far the worst translation I've encountered."
5,Retaining Top Employees,This product was exactly what it was stated to be. It was in excellent condition and the price was absolutely cost efficient. The price for the book was lower than the shipping and handling.
3,Kind of a dumb movie,"I wasn't really interested in this movie until about half way through. It was at that point that the characters stopped seeming like random people and started to interact more with each other. That's not the fault of the actors, it's how the movie was set up. I can't believe Lisa Kudrow did this low budget flick though."
1,Win or Lose,"I usually write a review of a movie if it is exceptional, or so bad I feel the need to vent. This movie falls into the latter category.I have watched alot of 'artsie' movies as of late and have liked quite a few, Broken Flowers, Closer, 21 Grams to name a few. This movie tried to reach that artistic note but came off as pretentious and vulgar.The story line is weak. It tried to be clever and filled with witwhich made it embarassing. Kind of like someone telling a bad joke, they laugh but know one else does.My previous reveiw of this movie was not posted here. Due to the subjects I wrote about. Well those subjects are what this movie is about so I won't mention them again. If you are into mindless vulgarity, and plotless stories that think they are clever you might enjoy this. I rate it as one of the worst I have ever seen."
4,Great Music,"I like Messianic music, so this was a treat for me. Many Paul Wilbur works, but others as well."
3,801 Questions that who asks?,"I bought this thinking the questions would be more along the lines of the questions I actually hear kids asking about God or Jesus. Much of this book is really just normal questions kids would ask about anything with a God based answer given. ""Is it wrong to make fun of nerds?"" Yes that's a good question and yes I am sure God has an opinion on the subject, but that's not a question about God is it?Oh and I was hoping for easy to swallow answers for the kids, but some of the answers are harder to explain than the question. Q: ""Why do people die?"" A: ""Because of sin.""I do think there is a market for this book and I do think it's a helpful read, but I think it's marketed a bit incorrectly."
3,Ho Hum,"Popeye the Sailor: 1941-1943, Vol. 3Having bought the first Vol and really enjoying it,i thought i would give the last Vol a try.To be honest i wished i hadnt.The difference between the two is startling.It was episode 10 before Bluto appears and the early episodes with Popeyes family (Father & Nephews)are dreadful.It picks up a bit when you get to the wartime ones but they are a bit samey and i dont know if its my imagination but both Popeye and Bluto didnt look the same as in Vol 1.Having said that,for the price its not a bad buy but compared to Vol 1 its very ho-hum"
5,Perfect RAM,Nothing to say except it works fine (in a Macbook) and makes the laptop much more efficient. Great deal!
5,Works great,I needed to upgrade my Macbook memory to install Mac OSX Lion. The memory was easy to install and works great.
4,An O.K. Collection,"This book served its purpose in my independent study. Some of the articles aren't written very well--I read at least one that was riddled with contradictions, and moreover, it didn't have much to do with homosexuality. Overall, however, the articles are interesting and informative for those people studying homosexuality in an anthropological context."
4,Too much stuff,"In a nation with way tooooooooooooooooooo much stuff, this publication offers some helpful and practical tips on how we all might become less burdened with our stuff and, at the same, create needed stuff for others."
4,"Not for beginners, but worth the effort","Holmes completed this summary of the common law before (I believe) his twenty-eight birthday because he believed that a man had to make his mark early in life if he were ever to pursue greatness. The Common Law is a great summary of the law as it existed early in this century and provides some insight into Holmes' methods and beliefs that would shape his judicial opinions. The Common Law is not easy reading, but provides a firm foundation for readers to begin their study of this complex man."
2,"The book is OK, but the CD is shocking","I found this book covers the topics OK, although it can be more precise & the objectives at the beginning of every chapter can be more succinct. The CD that accompanies the book is loaded with a number of software; however, I find the ""Practice Exam"" is bug ridden. It does not run properly; the GUI is screwed; the answers pop up at mysterious places; there are a number of typos and grammar errors. This program does not work in either NT server or Windows 95/98. The test questions are weak. My suggestion is use it as a coffee coaster."
5,great surrealistic prose poems,"These short prose poems are completely startling and odd, unlike most faked suburban surrealism from writer's workshops, these have a rough great edge. I can't quite understand them but I have read them all a hundred times in wonder at their charm, their strangeness, and their hallucinogetic power. I wish they were still in print, as I'd like to teach them."
3,"cute, put not much of a puppet.","Cute, but really only a hole in it, not a puppet. Can not control hand, foot, or head. Some of the ones that have your fingers as feet look more interesting. Good if you like pandas or have good imagination."
4,Bob the Builder Toolbelt a hit,"I bought the toolbelt for my 2 1/2 year old grandson. He is a Bob the Builder fan and also loves to help and ""build"" with Daddy. He loved all the tools and uses them frequently to repair his toy car and anything else that needs fixing. He loves the ""Bob messages"". The only criticism I have is that the tools are a little difficult to get in and out of the belt."
3,"Cute, but not captivating",The price was ok for the product. I wish it would have had more talking elements to it (I guess I should have looked at Handy Manny) than just the Bob square. My 18 month old hardly picks up the pieces other than Bob's face. It's sturdy and a good first tool set.
3,Not up to standards,"Clif Bars are ""THE BOMB"", not so with the 'Carrot Cake' variety. The chunks of carrot(?)were freeze dried or something and practically impossible to chew.Other varieties I have tried are;White Chocolate MacademiaChocolate ChipCranberryetc....All are excellent choices."
1,For Spencer Fans--this is terrible!!!,"All Jeremy Spencer Blues Fans--stay away from this one. No blues on this one. Just some bad 80's type songs with a truly bad singer--no Spencer. By the way--is it truly Jeremy playing the guitar and singing sometimes ? Can't tell. This is really bad and only for real Spencer fans who want it for their collection. Otherwise, stay away--this is truly 80s junk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,3DVD set,This was sent as a gift for my daughter who loves horses. I received the order within 2 days of the order - I am impressed with how fast they came.
5,Green Grass of Wyoming -Classis,I ordered a used copy of Green Grass of Wyoming but also got Flicka and Thunderhead CD's. All 3 stories were written by Mary O'Hara many years ago.My interest is in the Fairfied County fair ground scenes at Lancaster Ohio.I remember this film and the excitment as a child so I was very thrilled to find the classic on CD. My husband I ususally attend the Fair every October.
4,Fighting radiation,It is very informative. As someone who underwent two brain operations and 30 session of radiation it gives me good practical advice with nutrients and ways to combat the aftereffects of the radiation.
5,OBSESSED!,OK I LOVE ME SOME CARE BEARS! I WISH I COULD GET ALL THE ORIGINAL CARE BEARS THINGS ON DVD. MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD! GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS WHO WANT A FUN MEMORY. (IF U USED TO WATCH) LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
2,"Need to Be a Fan, For Certain","My wife grew up with both the Care Bears and the Gummi Bears. She could watch these things around the clock for hours on end. With that said, I did not. I came from an early period, when Christmas presentations were still the old films ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"", as well as the TV greats ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Frosty the Snowman"", by Rankin/Bass. If she were to review this, it would be through the ceiling with love and memories, so I though I would, instead, review it, since I'd purchased it for her and the fact that I am not biased in the least, meaning I am not a fan, yet I do not have any reason to despise the bears. The movie seems a bit plodding and has really nothing whatsoever to do with The Nutcracker. However, if you love the Care Bears, you may enjoy this one, too."
1,Newer Carebear Movies are Better.,"My 3 year old has a REALLY BIG THING for Carebears! She loves them and wants to watch them all the time. The only problem is that she was introduced to the ""newer"" version of the Carebears. She loves, ""Oopsy Does It!,"" and, ""Big Wish Movie.""She got this movie for Christmas and while it did hold her attention for maybe 10 minutes, she got tired of it. It just doesn't have the same colorful effects, and it doesn't hold their attention. It seems very bland compared to the newer ones. So my daughter would give this one thumbs down!As an adult, I really like the newer ones better too. They are much more creative and the stories are great. The Nutcracker had me wanting to go to sleep.On the other hand if your looking for the older versions of Carebears, then this might just be what your looking for."
2,not worth the money,I did not find this book helpful for my mri review for the registry. The image quality is aweful. I found a few typo's and mislabeled anatomy. Very disappointed.
5,MRI Tech. Greatest Tool for Registry,Precise and to the point. This guide helped me and will help anyone preparing to take MRI Registry exam. Highly recommended.
5,Simply beautiful,This Christmas jug is really beautiful; it added so much to my Christmas Table. I love it. Wish lots of people would order it.
2,Not impressed,"This book was heavy on artistic, time-consuming techniques. It was also laid out in monthly format, so things seemed scattered throughout instead of grouped together."
5,Perfect fit into Pilot Gel G2!,"I bought these after reading about how to convert these into the Pilot Gel G2 pens, and sure enough, they work perfect! I'm not the proud owner of two Pilot Gel G2's, that write just like the real Mont Blanc pens. An excellent way to combine the best ink refills with an already excellent pen. If you are unsure of how to do this, all you need is any sharp knife (I used a collapsable boxcutter I own, about $10 at Sears), cut off part of the end, and it fits in perfect (google search 'Mont Blanc gel G2' for a guide, anyone can easily do this."
5,A Great Adventure,A great book that reveals many secrets. While reading and meeting the many characters in the story one might feel as though they have indeed lived it or remember it. Powerful and wonderful to read.
3,Good recipes created with some hard-to-find ingredients,"When I purchased this book I thought, ""Wow! I can cut my shopping time in half and still serve excellent gourmet meals to my friends and family!""While the recipies were creative and pleasing to the eye as well as the palate, I had difficulty finding some of the ingredients. Ms. Gold's philosophy is, the better the ingredients the better the meal. I can't say I disagree. However, it was difficult when almost every time I wanted to make something I had to plan ahead and make either a special trip to the grocery store or ethnicgrocer.com.What I did like is that the book encouraged me (a novice cook) to think about how different ingredients taste and function together. This is knowledge I can use with all of my other cooking.Also, I should add that the photography and art design in this book is wonderful!"
1,use as VCR only,"What a junk of a product! The remote and the power button on the unit sometimes do not respond at all, so you have no choice but to unplug it. I have had to take a disc out and watch it on my computer, where I was able to do with ease. My unit upconverts up to 720p only. The audio coming out is delayed by a couple of seconds, no less. After calling Toshiba support, they said warranty for labor is only up to 3 months, and they would charge me $70. There has not been any firmware updates, so I don't know what they intend to fix! It gets one star because, on the bright side, you can at least watch VCR."
3,Works ok but controls are slow,"Got the unit to replace a similiar Samsung unit that didn't work too well. The Samsung unit was easier to use -- one touch control to dub from VCR to DVD which is my main reason I needed this unit. However the Samsung had trouble setting the VCR tracking which resulted in unacceptable results for DVD dubbing and for output to a TV.The Toshiba worked fine. However the controls are really slow. If you use the buttons on the front panel I recommend pressing the button for at least 2 seconds to get it to respond. The remote is really iffy. Also the controls aren't too user-friendly, you really need to read the manual to figure out how to dub from VCR to DVD.If what you want to do is copy VCR to DVD or output to a PC through a device like DVD Express then this unit works fine. If you're looking for a user-friendly unit that is mainly used for playback I'd look for another unit."
3,"My daughter loves it, but....","First let me say, this is one huge, fluffy cat puppet. We frequently mistake it for one of our real cats at a quick glance. My daughter LOVES puppets, she is 1 and thinks they are just hilarious. That being said, this puppet is difficult to use because the opening for your hand is fairly small and the mouth is small, so there isn't a lot of exaggerated animation going on with this. Also, the fur pulls out very easily in clumps, I thought it was hair from my actual cat, but no, chunks come off this kitty. I really think it makes a better stuffed animal than a puppet, but it is gorgeous and realistic and very soft. We have the Folkmanis pig puppet and it is a HUGE favorite of hers because it is much easier to animate and be silly with. I think for the cost of this there are better puppet options, but if you want a realistic looking stuffed animal, this is a good choice."
5,A great excellent macro lens,"[[ASIN:B000GPKQHQ Sigma 70mm F/2.8 EX DG Macro Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras]Prior to purchasing this lens, I did my research on macro lens, comparing technical specifications, prices and manufacturing countries. Contacting Nikon USA, the representative could not tell the manufacturing country. I had bad experience of owning a Japanese brand, made outside of Japan. Guaranteed by the manufacturer's brand name is not good enough. I like to buy and use a quality lens, not a brand name!!!! When I contacted Sigma USA, I got a positive reply that the lens is made in Japan.Great macro lens on my Nikon D700.Picture quality: Excellent. 9 Diaphragm Blades creates smooth bokeh, great for portraiture.Workmanship: ExcellentA full frame lens for serious photographers.Competitively priced at Amazon.com.Highly recommended."
2,Let's be serious for a moment here,"Uplifting and entertaining though this story may be, it is impossible to tell how much of it is true. Let's face it, no-one has ever been brought up by wolves, beautiful idea though it is. I would love to believe that wolves would take care of children, bring them up and feed them, but they don't.There aren't any properly documented examples of wolf-children. It is an urban myth. Most of the ""examples"" can be traced back to some carnival barker trying to sell tickets to see somebody like ""Pogo, the dog-faced boy"". Just because a 19th century carny hustler says that a kid was brought up by wolves doesn't make it true.I'm afraid that Misha either has a faulty memory or is telling an untruth here."
1,Writer admits this book is not true.,"I would like to see the reaction of some of the readers who have reviewed this book over the past ten years. The truth has been revealed. Misha's real name is Monique De Wael and her family wasn't Jewish. She made up this ""inspiring"" story and presented it as authobiographical. This book shows how easily the public's emotions can be manipulated by unscrupulous writers and how they can be deceived into accepting unprovable facts such as wolves raising children."
1,"""Teen Angst? NAAAH!""? NAAAAH!","""Teen Angst! NAAH!"" is yet another reason our literacy rate is on the decline. As I read it, I could literally feel the inherent filth seeping into my very body and desecrating my soul like some sort of relentless, burrowing bug with 3-inch long poison mandibles. 188 pages of Mr. Vizzini's own personal rants, gripes, and disenchantments with the agonizingly meaningless life of a typical self-absorbed teenager gives me cause to think about what I'm having for lunch, lest I lose it. It's a lot like a rectal exam, but without the benefits. Vizzini's brainchild would have been better off miscarried."
5,Relatable and funny,"I grew up in the exact same neighborhood as Vizzini, and I go to a similar, but far superior school (go Tech), and I can read this book time and time again and always enjoy it. It's nothing like those stupid, deep coming of age autobiographies that other writers write, but rather a collection of funny interesting stories that are easy to relate to. Overall, this book is entertaining and interesting and always a good read."
5,The NEW Bible,Ned Vizzini is a genius. EVERYBODY should own this book. Mr. Vizzini is the true messiah and every body who dosent own this book shall burn in the fires of hell for all eternity. After reading this book i can never read another one again. THAT'S RIGHT...IT WAS THAT GOOD. If you posses any intelligence you will buy this book now.
4,Great book,I love Ned's writing style and i wish his other book was on amazon. Ive read its kind of a funny story and it changed my life. this book help too.
3,Just some programming tricks!!,"I bought this book online and didn't check it out in the bookstore first. I almost read the entire book(because I don't want to waste my money. Otherwise, I won't even dare to write a review for this book) This book is just about a bunch of little programming tricks that may not even help you on the projects. Little bit from here and little bit from there. No match with Efficitive C++. The author just borrowed the name. Anyway, you just need to go to the bookstore and read the items you need. Please, save your money to buy other books."
1,Wrong color,Ordered this ivory cord and got black. Very annoying but not worth the trouble sending it back given the price.
1,Cancel order,I have tried to cancel this order for the last 3 days and I continue to get a response that an error occured and to try again in a few minutes. I notice that this book hasn't been shipped yet and I would like to cancel it. I have not found any way to contact the seller other than through the means of leaving feed back. I hope that some one can address this issue.
5,Excellent Book,"Overall this is not an excellent book to use as your main study guide, but I would also suggest using another source of information. The Enterprise exam that I took had several indepth questions relating to the IIS 3 as well as other topics that were gone over only briefly in the book.Overall a good purchase, as long as it's not your only source and not expensive to own."
1,Way Too Light-Go for a True M$ Guide,"I bought the New Riders as a boxed set and up to Enterprise the books appeared adequate. Luckily, I combined my studies with Exam Cram materials as well as company supplied Transcenders. In this case my study techniques paid-off because if I just used this book ...I would have blown the test. It skims over many of the most important concepts that are tested on the exam..the testing software supplied was way too light. This is one test I might push for the actual M$ study guide."
3,It's not as good as I thought...from 1st edition...,"I have readed 1st edition and this 2d edition, and I think this have not the order and hierarchy a review must have. I think there is a long way for Dr Skinner to revitalize this book for a 3rd edition as soon as possible. Maybe there are two books to see the Format : Apley's system and Ortho ' review."
1,Very Superficial,"""The Servant"" is certainly a best-seller in every country where it is marketed. However, the book is too superficial and its teachings are somewhat obvious, provided that serving is the very basic principle on leading others. Besides, all but everything in the book is not new, so that I had a deja vu feeling on reading it. Incidentally, many books like ""The Servant"" sell quite well and are not good (for instance, ""Who Moved My Cheese"" is one of them). Actually, I purchased ""The Servant"" because of its reputation."
2,Poor allocation of regurgitated ideas,"The only reason this book earns a second star is because the book chose good quotes and philosophies to review. This book could of been better had the Author left out all the characters in the daily classes and created a more personal relationship between the main character and Simeon where they explored Simeon's priciples deeper and with more theoretical applications and systems. But, it didn't and this book was painfully slow at times while on the tangents of the attendees of the leadership class. I really don't know how this book got such a high rating and waited for it to pick up the entire time I read it and it didn't. My opinion: Don't waste your time and money, stick with the classics - and this book it certainly no classic."
1,THEIR WORST EVER WORK YET!!!!!,ALTHOUGH THIS IS 'THE BEST OF' ALBUM I DON'T THINK THEY CHOSE THE RIGHT SONGS FOR THIS ALBUM.ANY OF THEIR SONGS WOULDN'T BE RIGHT FOR THE ALBUM BECAUSE THEY ARE S**TETHE SONGS THEY CHOSE WERE WICK!!!THEIR VIDEOS GIVE ME NIGHTMARES ESPECIALLY THE ONE WERE A HELICOPTER FALLS ON THEM!TOTALY S**TE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THIS GETS THE DARTH YOPA RATING OF NO THUMBS UP OR DOWN!!THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!
3,okay music,"this cd is okay, carpenters are okay not really my kind of music but the best songs on this cd aretracks1. we've Only just begun6. (they long to be) close to you8. i'll never fall in love againif you are a big carpenters fan then i recommend you listen to this cd"
4,Chief Ouray Review,"This is a biography of an Indian chief, Chief Ouray. He was a peacemaker for the Ute Indians. This biography is great for the young and older students. The layout of this biography is easy to follow. The illustrations are in black and white and reflect the scenes of how the Ute Indians' actually lived. The illustrations really made the book come alive! I could actually see Chief Ouray in action as he was being a great peacemaker. I really enjoyed reading this book. I learned a lot about the Ute Indians. Read it to your students and they will too!"
3,NEW TESTAMENT,"THIS BOOK WAS NEEDED FOR A COURSE IN RELIGION. I FIND IT INFORMATIVE, BUT HAVE FOUND ERRORS RELATED TO THE NEW TESTAMENT."
4,Pretty good product,OneNote is an excellent and handy product for both home and business. It would get 5 stars if it was just a little easier to sync between multiple computers. The sync procedure is somewhat complicated.
2,Buggy and inconsistent.,"Purchased OneNote for my new Tablet Laptop for school.First time I tried it, the pen featured kept disabling itself stating ""Windows XP tablet edition SP required"". Um, ok I have that preinstalled on the laptop. Formated my machine and put a still steamy new copy of XP tablet edition back on. Nada. Upgrade to SP3, nada. Most people have had little problems with this app, but if you are like me and roll the dice wrong. You are boned, there is NOTHING out there to help you and Microsoft just says ""We cannot clarify what or if there is a problem. Thank you."""
2,Great Software BUT...,"I had issues installing this on Vista. More clearly, it didn't install on Vista. It installs fine on XP. The interface compared to the 2003 version feels smoother. For what I use it for, 2003 would have been fine for me. Greatest feature to me is the ability to print it into a document, so you could print it out at another computer without Onenote installed. Like on some campuses."
5,BEST NEW FEIST TRILOGY IN A LONG TIME,Talon of the Silver Hawk is an excellent read so it King of Foxes. I've already ordered Exile's Return. Can't wait to finish reading it.
4,"Not the place to start the series, but a good continuation!","This new series had a strong opening and focuses on a new and quite likable character. The geographic focus has shifted as well - and since I am reading this on the Kindle, I do wish that the maps from previous books showed this area in a bit more detail. And though series staple characters like Pug, Nakor and Miranda made cameo appearances (and Rupert Avery even has a book written about him... though the exact timing of this seems a little skewed...).Still, this was an interesting continuation of the series, but as a starting point, I think that the shadowy, evil enemy would not be enough to keep me reading, since a lot of this is buildup from previous novels. Faithful readers know more than the main character, which would be off-putting to start the series here.Though entertaining, the plot was less complex than some of the other books, and I remain curious to see where this trilogy goes."
3,My first Feist; won't be my last,"Unlike most reviewers here, I approached this book having never even heard of Feist; a blank slate. The world and setting were a bit vague in a vacuum, but that lack made sense to me once I realized there were books preceding this one. The setting is a pretty standard medieval society. There is magic but it is incidental; nice, but immaterial. There were hints at an overriding external struggle between good and evil but it had little effect on the story. In other words, it read little like fantasy, more like good fiction.Other than that I found it a thoroughly enjoyable read. Talon was an likable character and his development was interesting and not too slow. The main characters were very black and white good/bad which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The writing was good and the pace satisfying.In short, the book was nothing earth shattering but worth a read or two."
4,Very fine tale,"I enjoyed Talon of the Silver Hawk. I've read the initial three series, but didn't care much for the last solo novels. This one had good character development and an appropriate story arc.The one thing I didn't like so much was the assumption that every reader had all the details of the first novels memorized. It's been quite a few years since I read the first books, and a lot of the people and events were a little hazy. While I hate it when novels simply regurgitate prior stories, especially when there are multiple volumes (do you hear me Mr. Jordan?), some background can be valuable. If not integrated into the story itself, perhaps an addendum or detailed glossary would have been nice."
4,Old story line.,"If you're looking for a new story line or a plot with a twist then this isn't your book. But if you enjoy just the way Raymond Fiest writes then you won't be disappointed. He does a great job of developing new charactors and always paints a detailed, wonderful world. He does rely that you have read most his other books and already have some knowledge of his older charactors to understand some of the underlying motivations they have. So to sum up again this book is a good read for fantasy lovers. But the good is not in the plot; it is in the writing and development of charactors."
1,What happened?,"I was a big, big fan of the original RiftWar series and the Empire series co-authored with Janny Wurts, so I thought I'd check out what Feist had written recently. I now wish I hadn't. To be blunt, I was disgusted by this book and couldn't finish it. The writing is good enough, but the whole atmosphere is nasty.The whole book reads like a long S&M; fantasy. Talon is a hopeless character who is constantly used and bullied by the people around him, the supposed ""good people"" in the world. He doesn't stand up to them, rather he seems to think it is his place to be put down and humiliated.I was particularly revolted to see Pug, a character I had grown quite fond of in previous books, acting so cruel and callous.I do not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Tribal boy recruit.We have one of those young boy grows up fantasy stories here. However, this one it appears is being recruited and trained as an agent that the wise and powerful can use in what is at the moment, a secret war.When a young boy's tribe is killed while he is undergoing his vision quest he falls in with a man who offers him place a a local settlement, where he can learn to fit into Midkemian society, and other more dangerous skills he has a natural aptitude for."
4,A good Product,A overall usefull product. It is a good choice for the people like us who like to keep in touch at short distances. So if you want a wireless then go for it.
1,Baaaaad Book,"I guess I just don't get the whole ""Sheep"" phenomenon. My child received three sheep books from an aunt who thought they were hysterical. I don't get it. I didn't find them to be cute or clever at all. In fact, I thought they were incredibly stupid and a complete waste of time. My son wasn't impressed either."
3,Cute Koala,This is cute but should be for a young group. Under the age of 10. Not the Christmas movie I thought it would be.
4,The story continues,"Contains episodes 9-12Vince and Pino have been taken to an empty domed city. Vince learns something about himself. Another new proxy, another fight, another dead proxy. A child copy of Re-l has been created. Daedelus creates a substance which can kill proxies. He hands bullets containing the substance to Re-l. Re-l and Iggy head out looking for the proxy and find Vince. A fifth proxy, another fight, Re-l shoots a proxy."
5,Wonderfully made,"I was very concerned about ordering DVDs that were not created by the original manufacturer. I just finished watching this set and I had no problems with it. All of the DVDs played wonderfully, even though two of them had been knocked loose during shipping. I loved that they included the extended exit interviews and the CBS Early Morning segments. I will definately be purchasing other seasons from Amazon. At least they are willing to create/sell more seasons. If we had to wait on CBS we would never get to see them again."
5,It's Survivor...what's there to complain about.,It's nice to finally see some of these seasons on a big-screen TV rather than via Youtube on a computer monitor. A great season with lots of fun and twists.There were no glitches with any of the DVDs. Audio and video were good.Keep 'em coming...
1,Lose Packaging,"When this product arrived, the contents were rattling around so bad that I had to open it up to see if it was broken (it was a gift for somebody else). The 5 disks inside were all lose. This is the worst CD case I have ever come across. None of the disks were broken, but the jury is still out on whether they will play properly. Keeping my fingers crossed. The other Survivor I purchased (Vanuatu), is in a different case that doesn't allow this to happen. I had already read a similar review regarding this issue here on Amazon, so I was forewarned. Can't see how this product could be shipped without the disks coming lose while in transit. Not the shippers fault - its the manufacturer."
2,Makes no sense,"The premise of this book makes no sense. The hero, John Bradford, wants to take revenge on the community he hates (but deep down loves) by kidnapping lady/serving woman Lacey Cochran??? And Lacey fears revealing the truth about her servant past because...well I don't know why. The books ends on a similar, incomprehensible note."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Another brick in the generic britpop wall. I liked the old version of Suzie but even that song's been pretty much ruined by the homogenously reverby overproduction of the album and the relative lack of personality in the vocals. It's a remarkable achievement in blandness, the producer seemingly doing all he can to muffle the effect of melody and rhythm, and for whatever reason the singer's now singing like it's his job rather than something he takes any enjoyment in. This is as definitive an example of music as a product rather than art as any teen pop star's album."
5,Inspiring,Every time i'd pick this up i'd feel inspired and happy even if just 5 minutes ago I was mad or upset. this book has powers to make you feel good and the advice is amazing.
3,Not that great,"I am John's daughter. I read some of it and the stuff about celebrities was kind of interesting, but I tried the thing w/ putting oil in my hair, and that totally backfired!!! I had to wash my hair like 5 times before I could get it out. So just so everyone knows, it's not completely reliable."
3,not a single photo!,"This book is full of good information, but I was hoping there would be some photos to go with make-up application tips for my pre-teen. She's a reader, so I think it will still be good for her, but for most girls her age I wouldn't recomend it."
5,Scholarly,"This is an excellent scholarly work on the Quran and the themes in it. Howeve its not for the novice. Rahman's analysis may not always be welcome by orthodoxy as he attains a semi-secular tone. This book along with Imam Ghazzali's ""Jewels of Quran"" can be an excellent combination to understand Quran."
3,A different take on Quranic Philosophy,"Prof. Fazul-ur-Rehman is known to be a scholar who caused quite a stir within the conservative Islamic world of Pakistani Ulema with his ideas regarding Propehthood and Revelation in particular and Quran and Islam in general.This particular text is not an easy read and the author seems to lose his way quite a few times when explaining his take on ideas in the Quran. The language is also sometimes 'archaic'. Overall, it is a good read for people who want to discover a different kind of take on Quranic themes but which are not necessarily anti-Islamic."
2,Not very durable,"I really liked this potty seat, until it broke in half. I only used it for about 3 months before it broke at the middle. Until that time, it was the perfect thing to get my 2 1/2 yr old to go potty on the go. I won't be ordering another one.. just not worth the money, but I suppose it did achieve the goal of getting my daughter to use public toilets (now she just goes with ""support"" from mommy), do I don't consider the original purchase a total loss."
3,good idea but needs some changes....,"I have a 30lb, 35 inche, 20 month old boy and average use was once a day. These are my main pros and consPros:1. great idea and/or concept.2. can be folded into a reasonable size that fits a large diaper bag or bagpack3. have some cushion, not a lot, but better not none and serves the purposeCons:1. material is not durable. the edge ripped after a week of usage.2. does not fit oval elongated toilets therefore it could be dangerous when your toddler is sitting on it unless you hold your toddler or the seat. fun! (or is my toddler too heavy or big?)Overall it was very good idea or concept but it could use some improvements because it could be a very useful item for long trips away from home."
1,Save your money,"I've potty trained 3 kids with the first two we got a cheap fold up seat for when we were out it worked fine. For number three I bought the Mommy's help cushie traveler the idea that it came with it's own bag and was cushioned sold me. Well the first time we used it it flexed under my 2 year old's weight (30lb) when he used his hands to stabilize himself the seat ended up pinching him enough to leave a red mark and breaking the skin. This seat is now useless since when ever we are out in public and I go to use it he yells NO SEAT HURT ME... I did read the other reviews and it seemed there were many more positive ones so I took the gamble for us it didn't pan out. Like I've said I have potty trained three kids so I'm not new to the concept of how to use a folding potty seat, this one just misses the mark"
5,Most Amazing Product EVER!,This is the most amazing product ever! I purchased this for my son because he had just begun potty training and would not go in public restrooms. Now he loves using this product and will even ask us to go to the bathroom when we are out.I did a lot of research before choosing to buy this item and I am thrilled with the choice that I made. It has not pinched my son as I read others do and also I have not had any problems with it fitting public toilets. The only thing that I would recommend is if you are using it on a larger toilet just put your child down gently and hold him/her in place for a moment to make sure it is secure. I have not had any problems with it fitting or not being secure at all and my son is 35lbs.I think this is a must for any parent!
2,Irritating seams,"At first glance, this looks like a great seat. I love the regular Cushie Tushie and thought the travel one would be perfect. However, the travel version has issues that I haven't seen others mention yet. The plastic heat sealed seams pucker at the corners as gathered fabric will usually do at corners. However,the gathered plastic is scratchy, almost sharp and irritated my toddler's bottom. She refused to use the seat after the seams scratched her bottom and thigh."
2,"Great idea, but not well made","I don't normally write reviews, but I think some parents need to know this. I loved the idea of having a cushy toilet seat that folds. We only used it few times then the seat broke while my 3 year old was seating on it! This obviously wasn't made to hold more than 34 pounds (that's what my 3 year old weighs)! Couple of screws came out then the seat fell into the toilet along with my son. I don't recommend it for any kid over 34 pounds....."
3,just OK,"I wanted a travel seat for my 2.5 year old son. I liked the idea of having a seat that could be used from the time he was potty trained to the time he would be strong enough to hold himself on a toilet without assistance. The seat works fine but it really sags under the weight of my child and I have fears that he will fall in! Especially tough on more oval-shaped bowls. However, it is a good alternative to the disposable seat covers that I have seen and we've had it now for about 6 months and it hasn't pinched him or shown any signs of wear and tear."
2,Not secure on elongated toilets.,"I rescued my toddler from a near drop into the public bowl when he started shifting around a little on the seat. It is most definitely NOT secure on the usual public restroom seats. If you put it all the way to the back, the front two sections squeeze in towards each other and if you put it all the way to the front or in the middle, it shifts around just as much. One wiggle too much and the edge will plop into the toilet, along with your kid. :("
3,refurbished not new,The pump arrived in sketchy packing. The when I opened it it was a refurbished pump. The hose to pump coupler broke the first use. I give it 3 stars due to price and quality.
4,pretty color,"So this was a very pretty green, but it did fade rather quickly. But when it shaded it wasnt a very ugly green it was still a nice light green. I wish it had lasted longer though"
1,Ugh! Ugh! Yuck!,"This stuff is just plain awful. Chaep, assembly-line anime. ""Tuxedo Mask""??? Hoo-boy! How hokey can you get. And the screechy voices of the ""sailor scouts"" or whatever...Egads!Pass on this one. Big Time."
4,Mona Bone Jakon,Thank you - Mona Bone Jakon safely received and in good condition. Couldn't afford to buy first time round - thank goodness for re-mastering.
3,Not one of Cat's better efforts,"This CD might not look as mediocre coming from another artist, but from Cat Stevens, it just does not seem up to par. If you already have Tea For The Tillerman, Teaser And The Firecat, Buddah And The Chocolate Box, and Foreigner, then I would still consider something like Matthew And Son, or Back To Earth before this one. I would have all of the ones I have just listed before adding this to your Cat collection."
3,Why the Edit,"I learned about Woody Herman in high school when I discovered the new young ""herd"". This LP was my first exposure as a young student of jazz to the great musicians who made up the early herds, such as Getz, Zoot, Don Lamond, Phil Wilson, etc. This is a fun session to be sure with great peformances by Getz on Early Autumn, Phil Wilson on Bijou, and the Four Brothers, Getz, Sims, Guiffre and Flip Phillips. One of the cool things about this session was to hear some great numbers by the young herd at the close of the set which have inexplicably been omitted on the CD.Still a great collection, but disappointingly incomplete."
5,Nice soldering iron,"Bought this to install the battery on my ipod and worked very nicely. The soldering iron package, has everythig you need to take care of those losse soldered points. Now it's time to use it to draw on wood."
4,Good Value...,A cheap solder is a cheap solder. It does its job. I bought it to fix an emerald bracelet and I was successful. I saved a lot of money fixing it myself than paying a jeweler...
3,Tips wear out fast,"Bought this iron for a little soldering. Works fine, but the tips wore out quite fast, after a few times one of the tips was quite unusable. Probably would go for a higher quality actual soldering station next time."
4,Never Been Any Reason not to own this CD,"There is ONE primary reason to buy this CD.The song ""Never Been Any Reason"". It is that good.The rest of this debut CD is quite good but that is THE song.It's the song on classic rock that everyone knows but no one recalls who did it.the other really good song is Love Me Tonight.Oddly enough I've had people believe this to be early (very early) Rush.That thinking is based on the voice early in; I can see how Head East's lead voice could be briefly mistaken for Geddy Lee, but the music doesn't sound like Rush.Overall this is a solid 4 Star album and a very good debut CD.Head East was a very good midwestern band who never broke big.That's too bad. I saw them live and they put on a good show."
4,"Good, but needs a tour!","I love One Note! It's awesome to have in the class rooms, I can type and also put side text and graphics into my notes, which I can't with Word. The only downsides is that older versions can't open these documents, they need to download a conversion first. But on the flipside, (if you knew how) you can save documents to be able to be opened by a previous version. The new look is a little scary at first, but if you play around with it for a half hour to learn where every thing is, it's not bad. I like the new look, I just wish it came with a tour. I haven't really messed with excel or powerpoint yet, I had to have it b/c my teachers send power points for notes. All-in-all I'm happy with my purchase!"
3,philstaf,"OK, but like other Microsoft products, such as Vista, it's less intuitive than the previous version."
4,Mostly wowed,"I really like the improvements in Word, as I use that software the most. Excel seems good, too, although I only use it at a minimal knowledge level. I haven't tried to play around with PowerPoint just yet, but I will need to master the newer version pretty soon, with an expected presentation scheduled for December. The OneNote is very confusing to me; I think I understand what Microsoft is trying to help me do with this software, but it hasn't made complete sense to me at this time, and a popup said I needed a particular file to make OneNote work best, but the file would not load on my computer. That was frustrating. However, except for OneNote, the suite of software programs seems pretty easy to figure out, and I'm thoroughly enjoying going to this upgrade. A good deal of thought went into making this suite more powerful in function and more beautiful in its appearance. -- Larry"
2,Where are the buttons?,"In Word, the tool bar is replaced with ribbons which means that several clicks are now needed to find common functions that were previously available right on the tool bar. Yes, you can create a custom tool bar, but the buttons are mini-size, which makes them somewhat harder to access. Overall, a real disappointment."
3,"Interface change is confusing, but OneNote is nice","I upgraded to Office 2007 from 2000 and 2003, but was disappointed with the user interface changes which I found confusing and much slower to use. However, I have discovered that One Note is very a very nice tool that really helps organize creative projects. At the $59 after Thanksgiving price, the whole package was an excellent value for home use. As a Thunderbird user, I was pleased that Outlook was absent :)"
3,Don't like it!,"Overall, I am very disappointed with Office 2007. Primarily because it does not allow users of older versions of Office Word to open documents created in MS Word 2007. So when you email an attachment created in Office 2007, many people have trouble opening them. I still use Word 2003 most of the time because of this feature."
5,money saver,"The price is right, due to my job loss, I was unable to purchase the pkg. in the store, at this price, I did not hesitate to buy it. I would recommend purchasing the pkg. I only wish Outlook was included."
1,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"This is a product that specifies that it is a non-commercial version when you get it, but does not say that before you purchase it. What are the limitations of a non-commercial version? It really does little more than the word processor and spreadsheet that come free with Windows. This version is not compatible with Office 2003 unless you download an update from the Windows site. I can not do this download at work, so I can not work on documents at home and then continue them at work. There are virtually no significant improvements to this suite compared to the 2003 Version. I would recommend stay with Office 2003 if that is an option."
1,I made a mistake,"I was tempted by my daughter and business partner's enthusiasm for their apple computers, but wanted to avoid the apple learning curve. I thought life would be easier if I made my new computer a pc. Terrible mistake, as it turns out. Windows 2007 not only requires a huge learning curve, the functionality is terrible. One example, when I browse web sites, the computer frequently freezes; it is so bad that control/alt/delete freezes and I have to shut the computer down via the power button. Screen menus cover up existing screen messages so nothing is readable. I have downloaded updates; there are still irritating problems. I am astonished that microsoft has regressed. I am worse off than I was with windows 2002. There may be more options to use with '07, but I will have to spend time learning how to find and use them, time I would have rather used learning a new apple computer."
1,"Product returned, return service terrible",I opted to take the product to the post office and pay for it to be returned myself instead of having them deduct the postage from the credit I would receive from the product being returned. I was given a label to use. The product was returned back to Amazon and I received an email saying I was being charged for postage even though I had already paid for it myself. I sent several emails to Amazon explaining this and still have not heard a single thing back. Terrible customer service!
1,not what i expected,"I got this to help me understand excel better as I am retired and work part time. Due to only limited use of excel on the job, I wanted this to help practice at home and understand it better. Its of no help at all as the programs are not alike. If you learn on this you will learn its different in the working world. Remember,( if you open it you own it.) Since I am on a fixed income I could'nt afford the office version."
1,so so,I was not happy with the service of the seller.But I am very happy with the respond and service of amazon.com.Thank you for crediting my account.
1,They should warn us,"My new laptop came with that awful Vista system (can't aviod it) and a free trial version of MS Office. I was not informed that you must delete this trial version before you can install the purchased version. A simple installation turned into a three hour session with MS's 'Help"" desk (a 1/2 hour spent being sent back and forth between 'installation' and 'activation' desks. It shouldn't be this difficult."
3,Office 2007 Student Version,"Good product, however I am waiting for the 2010 Student Office download information that was promised with the sale."
5,Home school,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 was recommmeded by MOVIP(Missouri Virtual Instruction Program) and it really helped.
4,MS Office Home & Student 2007,"Product was easily installed and updated certain programs automatically. It's different from the previous version and takes some getting used to, but I like the features. The only drawback is that people using a lower version of MS Word can't open 2007 documents unless you specifically indicate you want to save them as 97-2003 versions. Great product otherwise."
1,DO NOT BUY,"It has created all sorts of annoying glitches and after hours on the phone with some foreign Microsoft technician (whose English was very hard to understand), she solved one problem only to create several other problems. Very upset."
3,Great Price Compared to Others - Disappointed In the New Look and Feel,"I just bought a brand new computer with all of the bells and whistles on it, and so I needed to upgrade the software that came with the computer. I looked around and this by far and away was the best deal available.So far so good, but it's a big difference from using the old Microsoft Word and Excel versions of 2003. I'm dissapointed in Microsoft for designing something that seems like I have to learn all over again. I work remotely so I don't have the advantage of sitting down in a class and having someone explain the new features. I use both word and Excel extensively, and I feel like I have 2 new programs now. I wish Microsoft could keep things simple, and make updates to their products without requiring people like myself to take a class or re-learn something that I've been using for years."
4,"good, but where is Outlook?","I am not a power user, but think the product is pretty good. Some new features in Powerpoint are pretty cool. I miss Outlook, but just kept the 2003 version on my Vista Laptop"
1,Obligatory purchase,"I see this only as an obligatory purchase and an extra expense since Microsoft has the market on this and it is a pricey item to purchase for each computer we own. The product isn't perfect, but what other alternative would there really be in order to be compatible with the rest of the world?"
1,Terrible,"I've used Microsoft office for years, and I have no idea why they did what they did to word. It is terrible. I unistalled it and put my older version back on--they turned an easy to use program into a clunk amateurish program that is full of headaches. I wouldn't buy another version of office until they come up with something better."
3,Software,Ordered this awhile ago for my wife and she was able to use this Microsoft Office and Student 2007 for the purpose she needed at that time. No issues.
5,The Best Out There!!!!,This the perfect microsoft product out there for any student. It has everything that any student needs to be able to write a word doc. or do a prsentation and even if you need to do a spread sheet it has that too.
4,"Love the new capabilities, Hate learning all over again","I ordered Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 in spring after I bought a new computer and wanted updated Office products. It's very different in appearance from the old Office, so I really needed time to relearn how to use Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. It's lucky that I don't work full time in summer so I had the time, but I'm sure that's not the case with most people. The tutorials are helpful, but I guess it will just take time. The other problem is remembering to save everything in compatible mode so I can share it with other people. It will be better once everyone starts adopting this upgrade. I am glad that I got it!"
4,Office and Home,This product is not as intuitive to use as the last version I had but I haven't come across anything that reading a topic in the help didn't correct. I actually think its easier on the eyes when working for any length of time.
4,Operating System,I received exactly what I had purchased and was quite satisfied with price and time of delivery.
3,overpriced and lacks email,"For a single user, I either had to (or mistakenly) bought a three-license package. Also, no Outlook so you better like your alternatives."
2,Hawk,I have had this program for several days and have tried to load it numerous times. Have gone to the microsoft website and followed the directions and still it will not load. I had a trial word program and removed everything I could find and still no luck. It seems Microsoft has struck again with something loaded on my machine to prevent this.
1,Money down the drain,I have used MS Office since the beginning. This is the first time they came up with an upgrade where you have to forget everything you ever knew and start over. Even if you put in the time to learn it I didn't see where it did anything more than the older versions did. I reinstalled office XP and will never upgrade a MS product again.
4,Exel Whiz,"Disliking Microsoft products as being geared the the lowest common denominator, the MS Office Suite was purchased only to gain access to those e-mails that have Word and Excel programs. Although, the Excel program is user friendly and adequate for more sophisticated users."
3,nasty bomb inside,"this excellent program has one nasty , ugly feature. Documents composed on it, will not open on computers that do not have Vista. I can not sent items from Word to other poeple"
1,Product looked used and didn't work,Sadly the item looked like it was open and used. When I uploaded the info to my computer it caused my computer to freeze and shut down when I used the program.
4,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"Easy installation in Vista, has most features a home user needs, integrates well with Vista"
1,Not worth it,Very confusing to use. Can't find half of the commands to complete a project. Certainly not worth it's price tag. Stay with 2003 version.
4,It Does What It's Supposed To Do,Product is as described. I bought it to obtain a license for my laptop. It allows you up to three installs which is fair. You also get One Note which is a program that usually is not pre-loaded on computers and it is very helpful in organizing projects especially on tablet pc's.
3,Office 2007 Student,"The product arrived as promised and included the product key. However, when I went to install it I got a message that the license number was exceeded. I proceded to use the phone registration which ended up giving me a code that worked (took me a while to find the phone option on the Microsoft website). It was a hastle but it did end up working."
4,msn Word 2007,MS Word 2007 is easier and more user friendly to use than 2003 but the complexity makes it difficult to change some of the word writing options. A considerable amount of time will need to be spent to understand all the capabilities.
1,Rip Off,This product did not work. The product key was not valid. I am very unhappy and angry! Do not order from this company.
1,Do not ever buy anything from Worldwide Industries,"We purchased Microsoft Office 2007 in August 2010,,a cd was advertised; however all we received was paper downloadable instructions.When we contacted Worldwide, they apologized for the wrong code & sent us another one...which has never worked.We kept emaling Worldwide letting them know that they told us we were purchasing the CD (hard copy) of Microsoft Office, & to please send it, but they have not done anything about this. We're out about $80.00. Not happy!!!!"
4,Takes some getting used to,"As with most new Microsoft software, the layout of formatting options takes some getting used to. It appears as though (at least in Excel) that Microsoft has tried to make more formatting options available without using the menu options...will probably be a good thing once I learn where all the new icons are."
3,Not an improvement,"Office 2007 is not an improvement over Office 2003, in my opinion. My primary use of it is for word processing. Word's new user interface is a bit of an insult to a longtime power user like me. In the effort to make Word more user-friendly, Microsoft has in fact made it more confusing to previous Office users. It's cluttered and overly reliant on mouse action at the expense of the faster keyboard shortcuts. I waited two years before upgrading to 2007, but staying up to date is a necessity for someone like me who has to have software compatible with that of my clients. If I used Office only for my own personal purposes, however, I would probably return to the 2003 version."
1,Not what I expected.,This was not what I expected. The cd was not in the box. It had no certificate number. The label looked smeared. I do not recommend this seller.
1,It should have been an easy transation.,"The seller didn't view my original order. So, needless to say, I never received by order. The seller ignored my emails. Now I'm at the end of my transaction. It seemed to be such an easy buy. Well, so it goes. It is now being handled by the appropriate parties."
1,I was tricked,I was sent the wrong product and never recieved product I wanted. I did get my money back though.
1,Office Home and Student 2007 DOES NOT HAVE OUTLOOK,"I purchased two of these and discovered after opening the box that the suite does not include Microsoft Outlook. There was no way to return the product since the box was opened despite my complaints that the images online were not clear and what appeared to be Outlook on the front cover really read ""OneNote"" - a completely different program - but yes, begins with the letter ""O."" With the image being unclear, I should have inquired by calling but it would have been a lot more helpful if the image was clearer so that we could know what we were buying. While Amazon customer service was helpful, a refund or credit was out of their hands because the product was sold via a third-party vendor- who was very unfriendly. I would not recommend this product nor would I recommend purchasing anything through a third-party since there is little if any recourse you have as a customer when purchasing their products."
4,Good work-horse for work and school,"My purchase of this product was to upgrade from my previous version (2003). The changed format is a bit more of a challenge at first, but it incorporates tools I use frequently into the main portion of the program (word count, etc.), which makes it easier for me to function.It is worth the price."
4,Low Cost same product,"The software is the same as buying it off the shelf at a retail store, but through Amazon it is cheaper. I received it in two days even though I selected the free shipping option."
3,Better than what I've been using-BUT FREEZES UP,"I bought this hoping that I would have a smooth transition from the Microsoft Works program that came with my five year old computer. That program worked fine but did not have all the bells and whistles that this program offers. Well, Home and Office 2007 freezes my computer if I leave it up for awhile. When it works, it is great. I don't mind and of the surface changes. I give it 3 stars because of the freezes. Very disappointing."
2,"If you're a writer, DO NOT BUY Home and Student version of Office 2007","I have Microsoft Office 2007 Home and Student Version which states on every page ""NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY"". I never noticed this warning until I started taking writing classes. My class teacher and others did not know what this meant and I had to call Microsoft to find out. You are not even able to send anything by email. This came bundled with other software when I bought my computer.(no caution here) Now I'm on Amazon shopping for a full version of Microsoft Office Suite 2007 and it is not even possible to upgrade my Home and Student Version. Why does no one tell consumers this easy caution. Otherwise, this suite has all the bells and whistles you want. Marge M."
2,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"This product, is not as easy to work with, Eg. the new tool bars? as far as locating the command I am looking for, Where is the on line help?, to me, version 2003 was less complicated, remember, more is not always better. How do I transfer old files to ver. 2007? Inserting a row took me 3 min. to find the right icon, and the list goes on and on."
4,Good product.,"Good product, but there is a little bit of a learning curve if you are used to the older versions of Microsoft products. Also, Word, Excel, and Powerpoint all seem to load slower (than the older version) and they freeze up more when saving sometimes. Still, I am happy with the product and getting used to the new layout."
4,Microsoft has many new features,"I haven't been using the newer version of Office for very long, but so far I have been very pleased with it. I especially like the One Note. It has become a program I use about every day. It takes some getting used to since the setup has changed, but I like the new features."
1,MS OFFICE STUDENT TEACHER ADDITION,I received a corrupted copy of the MS Office Student Teacher Addition. Customer Service was quite helpful shipped out a replacement promptly. The replacement copy was also corrupted so I cancelled my order and purchased an off the shelf MS Office and it worked just fine from OfficeMax.I did notify customer service that their packages were all probably defective.
5,Microsoft Home Word 2007 Word software,"Excellent product, great value. This version is a little different but has some very good resources for the student or homemaker using Word."
5,Microsoft Office software,"This is my third order with Amazon.com each time I have been very pleased. The Microsoft software package that I purchased was priced lower than any other supplier that I could find. The condition of the product was excellent, the shipping was within three days. I will continue to order from Amazon.com when a product I need is available. I recommend Amazon to all.Bill"
4,Just what we needed,"We needed this for a small municipal organization and are very pleased with the pricing and how easy it was to download. We're still noodling around with it, but it has all the stuff we want"
2,Principal Analyst,2007 MS Office Prosuct is not very user friendly and there are some system bugs that casses sytem to stall priodically.
3,NOT AS EXPECTED,I have had several word products before and it's all downloaded perfectly on my desktop. I have to search more for things with this program. Not as expected but I'm learning to work with it.
4,Photographer,"I know how to use the older full versions. This has changed a lot, so you will have to learn how to use it. Its worth the money."
5,Computer Software,"The product was exactly what I expected; however, I ended up purchasing a new computer which already had this installed so I ended up not needing it afterall. I do appreciate your assistance in allowing me to return said item. As always, I am truly happy with the service I receive from your organization. Keep up the good work."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchsed this product a couple of months ago after my computer crashed and was immediately surprised to find that my Outlook Express email spell/check was now in French. There is no option to change it to English. I contacted Microsoft and they were absolutely no help at all. If you check on the internet about this problem, you will find that Microsoft has known about it since April of 2007, but opt not to fix it. I wish I had my money back."
5,What I needed for less,The product arrived in a box sealed and brand new condition as advertised. Delivery took a few days longer than I expected but it was worth the wait. I saved over 50 bux!!!
3,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"Product was shipped very quickly and arrived in good condition. Price was better than buying directly from Microsoft,even after the surprise $35.00 tax/duty or whatever.Product worked fine after I resolved some conflicting software issues in my PC. Compared to older versions of Office there are a lot of annoying changes that do not provide me with anything that is useful to me. This is especially true of Word."
3,C.J. Parker's Office 2007 Review,"Overall, I think it will be a good tool, however just installing it recently, and learning everything about it, has become quite a challenge for me. I struggle with my scholastic papers regarding title page formatting.I just need to have more patience with myself, as I know I will enjoy using this software the more I use it.Sincerely,C.J. Parker"
5,Great new version of Office,Office 2007 makes many office tasks easier and more intuitive. It is also full of many visualy pleasing tools for photos etc... Best version of office yet!
3,Over priced,"I purchased this product from you for $84.99. I was very disappointed when I received an email a couple of days later offering it at $69.99. I considered returning it then ordering another one, but decided the cost of postage would have probably cost me more than the $15 savings."
4,micro soft office,thanksit's a must for my ibm systemnext time MACi messed up getting vista and should have known betteri won't make that mistake again
1,A Sorry Excuse for any company to sell,"This is junk software and was even being toted by QVC as a great addition to their Dell 17"" Todays Special Value ""over 200.00 Office software"". Everyone failed to mention is was not for commercial use and is around $50.00. It is a trial version at best and and not even that good. Stay away from it as long as you can. I not have a 1700.00 Dell with junk Vista and not Junk Office Home and Student NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE. Can't trust anyone and that is sad."
1,Office Home and Student 2007,I have had lots of problems with the installation of this product. I have spent over 7 hours on the phone with Microsoft India and it still isn't completely right. My suggestion would be to uninstall any previous version of Office before installing this product. I believe another complication is installing it on Vista.
3,Way too difficult to use,"If you don't have to switch to the 2007 version, don't do it. It is very difficult to learn to use. Nothing is where you would expect it to be, and Help is unbelievably poor. Some of it's just dumb, like replacing the ""File"" menu with an icon which doesn't sit in a line with the rest of the menu items, so there is no visual clue whatsoever that that icon is actually the file menu. It's as though Microsoft went out of their way to make the transition to the Office 2007 as painful as possible. Even their new operating system retains the option for a ""classic"" view; why not Office? I have found no new redeeming qualities that compensate for the steepness of the learning curve for this new product, and frankly, I regret having made the upgrade. I am not alone: my wife refuses to upgrade her Office suite, after having seen the 2007 suite."
1,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it - hold on to Office 2003","This update of Office is horrible. I just started using it, bundled on a new desktop. Saving a Powerpoint file takes the program 15 seconds, during which it is essentially paralyzed (on an insanely powerful Dell Optiplex). Trying to insert new slides from old files, the program again has a paralyzing brain fart while you try to browse folders. Everything is completely re-organized and no longer intuitive; what was ""broken"" in Office 2003 that needed this massive re-organization? It takes me five minutes to do something as simple as a word count in Word. I've had to install their Powerpoint and Word guides to work through this transition. This program is absolute garbage, hold on to Office 2003."
2,Questions re compatability,"I tried to open an Excel spreadsheet created on Office 2003 in Office 2007. I could open it but was unable to edit or input into the spreadsheet at all. Microsoft (after 35 minutes on the phone) tells me it's just a fluke of the trial version of Office 2007, but if you need to use different computers with different versions of Office (i.e., switch between home and work), this is a concern."
1,Office 2007 Toolbars,"As an experienced Word and Excel user, the inability to customize toolbars and not being able to use customized toolbars with Macros that I created in earlier versions is a terrible loss. So many things that I could do with one click in the past takes multiple clicks now. Using customized styles in Word now is very difficult."
4,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007,"The Microsoft Office Home and Student Version 2007 is a great improvement over Microsoft's past approaches to product upgrades. I have been a user of Office for many years; however, I would not purchase the Full Version of Office 2007 because of its price. The Home and Student package fits my need for a home version of this product at a reasonable price. Plenty of upgrades are in this package and in runs great on my new laptop with Vista."
2,Microsoft blew it,The old Microsoft Office was the best and the easy to use. Most of the changes that were made seem to have come from the people they use in the commercials about Windows 7 that come across like novices and gamers. I suggest staying with the old office until it is no longer supported.
3,Hard for me to navigate,I feel this version is much harder for me to navigate and find the features I want to use. But I do not use it that often to make it a big issue.
4,MicroSoft Office Home & Student,"My experience has been with MicroSoft Office on my job. Once you get the hang of how Vista works, I find I like it. I especially love the 'One Note' which is included in the suite. It is so cool to compile data from list groups and surfing the web. I very rarely print anything anymore, closer to paperless!"
4,Good for adventurous souls ... frustrating for old dogs!,"I use MS Office at work and have been using Office for over ten years. This version, at first, seems drastically different in the way it is organized on the screen. But after a few hours of use I feel very comfortable using its features and I think it is an improvement over older versions. I was hesitant at first to upgrade due to many negative reviews of the product. But I have to say that most of the features are improved and even easier to use.So if you are a new user I would not hesitate to buy this product. If you are currently happy using an old Office version AND are the type who gets frustrated learning new tricks then save your money and hold out for the next upgrade."
5,Mircosoft Office 2007 Student version,"Product arrived in a couple of days and was perfect! Very impressed with the ""quick"" delivery. No problems of any kind."
4,New version of office,"This new version of MSOffice is pretty typical Microsoft. I have not encountered any bugs or glitches yet, but Service Pack 1 is already out. I'm glad it has a three-computer license, so when I get rid of this computer, I can install it on another."
3,Hard to get used to,"I bought the updated MS Office after completely ruining my laptop and having to reinstall all my software after Dell essentially replaced everything in my computer but the processor. MS Office was the only thing I couldn't find the system disks for, so I wound up out $120 for a replacement. Strike one.It does work. It's fine. But I HATE the interface. After years of the 2003 version, the 2007 version is very difficult to navigate and not at all intuitive. I cannot find even simple functions, and it took me almost 5 minutes to figure out how to use ""Save As."" Plus most people have the 2003 version, so when you get e-mail attachments, you keep having to mess around with compatibility. Be prepared to be very frustrated for a few days until you start to get the hang of how to use this, because it's like I have to relearn the programs all over again.And the packaging is an enormous pain to get open."
1,"Will Give You a Case of ""Pullyourhairout-itis""","The new Microsoft Office definitely performs very well in terms of speed, but the glaring issue everyone mentions about the new Office is the interface.It's tedious, it's difficult to maneuver, it's everything you don't want to deal with when you are trying to be productive and get things done quickly.Draw a double-line? Maybe, I'm still trying to figure that one out. In Office 2003 I can do it in a matter of 5 seconds.Add borders to an existing paragraph style? Maybe, I spent 30 minutes the other night trying to do this with no luck. At work (where I use Office 2003) I did it in a matter of 5-10 seconds.Sometimes even the simple tasks, finding program options, finding the ""About"" screen to see what service pack you are running will take you several minutes to figure out.Experienced users will long for a menu bar, new users will probably be alright as long as they don't try to do much beyond the scripted Microsoft styles."
3,mixed reaction,"I agree with a previous reviewer that we don't need to see ""non-commercial use"" at the top of every doc. Adds clutter. I have found navigating the tool bars time consuming as I learn the new layout. To solve the problem that older versions cannot read 2007 docs, I downloaded a free pdf writer and now 'print' my docs as pdf files before attaching to emails. Having been a Works user at home, I am enjoying the versatility and ease of creating powerpoints, flyers, newsletters etc for my various volunteer organizations. Like any change, it takes time to adjust to someone else's decision as to what is an improvement and what is change simply to make something else obsolete!"
5,Mishunia from California,"I like Office Home and Student 2007.Very easy to operate and looks pretty.Just take your time, be patient and you will like it."
4,met my needs,"I bought this because I needed the Power Point program for a game/presentation. It worked just fine. I however am not crazy about the new Word update. I find it harder and more time consuming to use than earlier versions. This, of course, is a personal opinion, and I'm sure others love it. All in all, this was a very good purchase at Amazon as the same product costs at least twice as much elsewhere, including Costco!!"
5,I love the UPDATES in Word and Excel 2007,"I've always been a fan of Microsoft Office but this new improved 2007 version is bad a**. I love it. It took me about two weeks to get used to it and understand where everything is but it was worth it. It is so easy to use and learn. This is my first experiacne with OneNote and I have to say where has this been all my life? I absolutely love OneNote, it is awesome!"
3,Really?,"Ok, I gave it 3 stars because I watched the whole thing, and wasn't mad at myself for doing so.I thought it to be a low budget film school ripoff of a Coen Bros/Tarantino genre' reject.Still... throughout the movie I couldn't help but think of my running buddies from the old days who are all dead now due to un-natural causes.I would never put this on a must see or favorite list, but I would also never say to not view it. You just might see a few things that remind you of your own running buddies?"
1,Too tiny!,"I had no idea how tiny these dolls were going to be. There should have been something in the advertising to let a collector of McFarlane NBA dolls know that these were not the normal size; and were, in fact, miniatures. They hardly look like anybody, let alone Allen Iverson and Chris Webber. A HUGE disappointment for me and my son."
5,Language and thought out of the ordinary,"Because I had bought and read his latest book I decided to buy an old one. Since his songs are poems set to music this book is prose brought to the level of poetry. Short thoughts on his relationship to a higher being or muse or idea. Thought provoking. A pleasure just to read. The man has spent his life finding the right words and metaphoric language for his deep thoughts on love and meaning and life. Thank you, Leonard"
5,Looks Great!,"Beautiful piece, easy to install, and looks great in my kitchen. I am very pleased with this product. It also supports over 200 lbs., so it doubles as the perfect swing for my kids."
2,Weak and incomplete,"This book promises much, but delivers little. For starters, it has several errors--for example, on page 188, several times it refers to ""EJB"" as ""EBJ"". Perhaps that's trivial, but, chapter after chapter, I found faults in the examples that prevented them from running. Worst is the chapter on Entity Beans--it contains a reasonably good expose on the theory and practice of Entity Beans, but the example contains no client code, no instructions on mapping the Entity Bean to an underlying database, and no clue as to the relational tables that the Entity Bean accesses.In other words, this book lost my trust. If you buy it, read it for the solid explanations of the concepts around jsp's, servlets, tag libraries, and EJB's--but don't expect the examples to work. And have your environment already set up, because this book won't guide you through that."
2,Pinzon Hotel Sheets,"The feel of the sheet is good, but the details, such as the elastic are questionable. Elastic on fitted sheet is loose and slips off easily."
1,Plastic sheets?,"When this item arrived the box had a terrible odor--something like gasoline or some kind of bug spray. When the box was opened, the odor was even worse! I had to wash the sheets five times to get the odor out. The sound when moving the sheets from washer to dryer was that of plastic--like a plastic shower curtain. I have no idea what makes the sheets sound like this, but the sound is still there even after all the washings and drying. I was sorely disappointed with this purchase!"
2,Disappointed,"Pros: Small size, 3 ways to charge (USB, Electrical outlet, Car), Comes in Cool Colors- attractive, caller can hear voice clearlyCons: Drops connection with phone frequently, Can't hear caller well, can't go far from phone before it starts beeping, not comfortable on ear- clip doesn't stay secure and ear canal piece is big and uncomfortable, volume buttons are reversed-awkward because the volume up is on the bottom, and volume down is on the top of the unit.I was hoping for much more when I received this device. It is really cute to look at but that is where the attraction ends. I struggle to hear the other party even after turning my phone all the way up and I can be sitting still and my call is dropped from the bluetooth, yet the caller is still on the phone.I would not recommend this product to someone who is used to using a bluetooth. It may be fine for a teenager or someone who has never had one."
5,Wonderful,I enjoyed this album as a kidwas very excited to find it recentlythe original songs are outstandingcan play over and overthe additional 2 are okEveryone remembers the cover photo!
2,very little information,I found this book to be way too long (701 pages) with very little information. He wrote about 4 murders but didn't bother with information on 2 of them. It also was a little boring. It should have been way shorter but more informative. not worth reading.
5,Fantastic,"Anyone that is even remotely a fan of spider man should pick up this book. I just started reading graphic novels recently and this is one of the best ones I have read so far. I loved spider man when I was a kid, now I remember why."
2,i do not know what to say,"i did not have an expectation of the movie but this one is really b rated weak story line lost me right from the start,i wouldn't suggest it."
3,GE 17451 90 Watt Outdoor Halogen 1-1/2+ Year Floodlight PAR38 Light...,GE 17451 90 Watt Outdoor Halogen 1-1/2+ Year Floodlight PAR38 Light...It's okayIt's okayGE 17451 90 Watt Outdoor Halogen 1-1/2+ Year Floodlight PAR38 Light...General ElectricHow do you rate this product?
4,Don't Judge a Book By The Cover,"This film's storage case depicts what appears to be a typical ""shoot-em-up"" mindless action film. Don't let that fool you. While it is fairly graphic and there is a bit of gun play...althought not by actor Billy Zane, the film is clearly intended to educate the audience on the ethnic violence in yet another failed African state. The character of the Janjaweed Militia leader is especially effective at quietly detailing the reasons for the conflict and the AU military escort officer the hopelessness of being a peacekeeper with few resources and a limited mandate. I highly recommend it."
1,unfortunatly outdated,Nice package (as usual with HRR) but articles are VERY outdated (late '90). I do not recommend it.
4,Something New?,Okay...so ive read the back flap and the intro so far. Not too bad from what I can see. Hopefully this book will say something new that I havent already heard before. It definatly looks promising and should make a good edition to my collection.
2,SOME QURANIC NUMEROLOGY & CONSPIRACY THEORIES,"I became aware of this book because it was listed on the ""PRIORY OF SION BIBLIOGRAPHY"" by Paul Smith. This book can be a resource if you want to know about possible Quranic numerology or if you are into conspiracy theories. It seems to combine numerology, conspiracy theories, the Biblical prophetic traditions, Islamic hadith, and Nostradamus predictions and apply it to the Quran. I found that it was hard to follow, and incoherent at times and it was also replete with grammar and spelling mistakes. However, with that said, I felt it was a serious attempt to understand the world which we live despite its subjective predictions and interpretations."
5,Hard to fine but work great,This basket was hard to fine but was just what I was looking for. It fits the sink like a glove.
1,Noisy,"I purchased this hub, but it made an obnoxious squealing noise when plugged into every computer I could find -- even without any other firewire devices connected.I returned it for a replacement, but the new one made the same noise.Is it too much to ask for a device with no moving parts or speaker to be silent? At least design a case that will contain the noise."
1,waste of time,I was so excited when I got my husband to read this book. but all it was was joking about pregnancy when the baby comes and worthless information. to top it off my husband didn't even find it funny
2,Not useful,This book is great for poking fun at pregnancy- not for providing any useful information. I was looking for a book for my husband that would have more of a balance of information. Something that wouldn't be too serious and medical but would also give some basic information about pregnancy. My husband didnt' belive that being flat out tired was a normal part of the first trimester- a book that gave some basics would have been helpful!
4,Perfect for the dad-to-be to take the edge off...,"My hubby loves this book because it's a humorous way to ""ease"" into what being a dad will be like. I think this coupled with the more ""serious"" books we have help make him more relaxed. :)"
3,some real moments of humor with too much filler,"Yes, it is a parody of the What to expect when you're expecting real book on pregnancy written for the father. Now that you know that, it is amusing in places with some downright funny parts, but overall I wish it had been funnier. Maybe it tries to give real advice every once in a while instead of sticking to just humor which might confuse some readers (judging from the reviews that didn't notice it was funny?). I feel the same way about this book I feel about episodes of Monty Python and the Flying Circus -- some great skits with lots of mediocre bits thrown in. It was a clever idea that I feel could have reached even higher comic levels, but as a quick funny read for fathers, it might just hit the spot."
1,Wast of Money and Time,"If you are actually excited about your wife bringing you a little bundle joy, don't buy this book. Providing excuses to get out of appointments with your wife, excessive beer drinking to help you cope is not what I was hoping for. I was hoping for an informative guide with a little humor to help me understand what she is going through so I can be a better husband. Not the case."
1,What to Expect when your wife is expanding,My husband hated this book. He said the author made it sound like everything was a big joke. He stopped reading it about half way through. What a disappointment.
5,My Husband Loved it,"My Husband loved this book, I would recommend it for any husband of an expacantent wife!!"
1,This Book is Not Funny,"This book was purchased for me as a gift from my wife. I did not find this book to be even slightly amusing. The subjects that are covered in this book that are supposed to be humorous were in fact insulting to my intelligence. I believe that it is a serious problem if males make fun of their wives/girlfriends when pregnant.Instead of using real humor this book uses stereotypes and the notion that all males hate their significant others. This book relies on the typical misogyny that males in our society find amusing. We should be encouraging and supporting our significant others rather than mocking them. From a medical prospective I do not think males should mock or discourage healthy weight gain in pregnant females. Also, I no not agree with mocking, making fun of, or parodying other healthy symptoms of pregantcy."
1,Unoriginal,"I gave this book a low rating, not because it's ""offensive,"" but because it's blah humor.I am a huge fan of offensive parodies (ex - South Park and Family Guy), but I found this book disappointingly boring. The jokes might be funny to the type of person who laughs at things like outdated Pollock jokes, but most folks would find it to be a major yawn-fest...or just annoying. If I get a funny book, I want to laugh through most of it--not just a random sentence or two on every 50 pages (too much work).Anyhue, if you want to laugh at pregnancy, better books are ""Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads,"" ""My Boys Can Swim"" (for the gents) and ""Pregnancy Sucks"" (for the ladies). They are waaaay more funny AND somewhat educational too (whoa! what a concept)."
1,"The ""all men are idiots"" guide to pregnancy.","If you think that ""typical male"" is a cute compliment, you might like this book. It assumes a father is basically a complete moron perfectly happy to allow the mother of his child to do it all, while he kicks back with a beer. (in fact, I believe it recommends this practice) If that sounds like you, buy this book. Otherwise, stay away, STAY AWAY!! It's trite, idiotic, and insultingly chauvinistic. Perhaps a good book for football buddies to buy for each other as a joke. You know, with the big bottle of aspirin and the six pack."
3,Okay,"My mate enjoyed it, but when you want your man to be compassionate about your every ache and pain, don't let him read this, as he will say. ""Oh, they said you would complain about that!"" Get your mate to sign up for babycenter emails instead, they will keep him well informed of your baby's development and what you are going through. Then he will lend a knowledgable and loving ear to your aches and pains.The item was shipped promptly from the vendor."
1,Don't buy this unless you enjoy sarcasm...,"I bought this book thinking it would make a nice gift for my husband. I thought it might teach him a bit about what was going on with me while I was pregnant. I read it first, and found it to be sarcastic and stupid. Its not ""educational"" at all. I never gave it to him."
1,BIG BAD JOKE,This is NOT the kind of book a responsible father would read. This book expose the bad things of pregnancy and fatherhood. I don't recommend this book at all. Please look somewhere else if you are really interested in how you can help your wife during this important phase.
5,the reviewer from california needs to check his/her history,"Ray Charles was and still is one of the greatest musicians ever existed!!!!!!! He was also a great songwriter, arranger and producer and the person who wrote review from california needs to check his/her history BIG TIME!!!!!! Although I like ""some"" of todays artists, they can't TOUCH the chops of Ray Charles. Those cats out today aren't even in the same BALL PARK as ""THE RAY""!!!!!!(PERIOD) Ray Charles influenced the musician in me that I am today!!!! Thank GOD for the gift of having such GENIUS that he WAS, IS and ALWAYS WILL BE!!!!!"
2,A review written by German students,"The following review was written by a group of 18-year-old German students who read Susan Hill's novel in an English language class at a German high school:"" Bullying is a very important topic today which concerns a lot of young people. The writer has a lot of good ideas to convince the reader of the enormous consequences of bullying. However, the two main characters are too extreme and only stereotypes. They are psychologically unrealistic, especially Hooper, who is more calculating and evil than an eleven-year-old boy normally is. The long descriptive and symbolic passages make it difficult to read for a foreign reader. In general, Susan Hill's approach is interesting but she could have varied the subject a bit more. """
3,The Virginian,"I like the old version, more than the new. I appreciate the hero doing what is right, Joel Mcra is a believable hero. the acting was fairly good, the virginian's friend who chose to go the wrong way, was a little weak in his character. The love story could have been developed a little more. But in the end it was an enjoyable movie. I would buy it to have in my library if it was DVD format."
5,There's NO place like home!,"Fantastic stories in this small but jam-packed book. Some might call the old Hudson County gray and grimy, but you couldn't find more colorful stories than these. Public officials lining up gangsters for penalty kicks in the huevos, berating citizens while they're stretched out on an ambulance stretcher, pulling wads of cash out of their desk drawers - that just skims the surface of this incredible book.I'm not sure about the appropriateness of this for young kids, but it should be required reading for anyone who wants to know how things really did (do?) ""work""."
5,Perfect!,"Great price and very fast shipping. I am using these on my outdoor porch for the Christmas season. They were the cheapest price around. Thank you Although they were specified for indoor use, I am hoping these will last a few years."
1,Not effective,"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I tried this product in good faith for 3 weeks, hoping to lose a few pounds. Absolutely no change or effect at all."
3,Not what it states..,"This product was not what i expected...i am not over weight i am 5'1"" @ 125lbs and this product did NOTHING! Don't waste your $$$"
5,Great,"New refills for my favorite pen, what else do you need. These are made in Japan and appear to be genuine. Tough to find the refills in stores."
5,Love these pens,"This is the pen I use at work daily. I print very small and neat and this extra fine point pen refill is perfect. These refills were a great purchase, received in excellent time and the price was very good. I will definitely purchase these refills again on Amazon."
5,Come for the voice. Stay for the songs!,"It's the ""all-you-can-eat"" buffet that gets better with every trip back. If you like the quieter side of Greg ""Oblivian"" Cartwrights's musical output then you will dig this very much, but if you come expecting the loud guitars that he is famous for then you will obviously be dissappointed(save for one song). This is an excellent collection of out-takes, and material recorded just prior to the line-up change that precipated the ""Too Much Guitar"" album. They finished this beautiful piece of work and then lost the organ-fellow so they needed an album that better represented the more guitar-oriented live sound. Greg's getting closer and closer to being the punk Gene Clark."
4,nothing like live after death,"Don't get me wrong, Rock in Rio is a great live album. The fact that Iron Maiden can draw enough fans to drown out Bruce's voice on the Wicker Man (250,000+) after more than 20 years is amazing and a testament to how great they are. I just prefer Live After Death. The setlist on Live After Death is a million times better than the list for Rock in Rio. I was disappointed to hear so many songs from Brave New World and not enough classics. In general though, Rock in Rio is great...Rock in Rio = 4 out of 5 starsLive After Death = 5.5 out of 5, its that good"
2,Not recommended at all.,"The show by IRON MAIDEN in Rock in Rio was really a great event. The band was in top-notch form, except for Janick Gers, as always, who simply does not know how to make a guitar solo!! But, for a MAIDEN fan, what's the point in buying another live album by this band? It's clearly a mutual selling: they are feeding upon the great hype made with the BRAVE NEW WORLD album, when Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith came back. Other than this, Maiden has already so many live albums, that why bother with another one containing the same material??!! (of course, ROCK IN RIO has some songs from the new album... big deal...). Do you doubt me? Check Maiden live albums:* MADE IN JAPAN (EP)* LIVE AFTER DEATH* A REAL LIVE ONE* A REAL DEAD ONE* LIVE AT DONNINGTON"
1,These guys [stink],"After attending several iron maiden concerts, which were pretty cool. I decided to borrow Rock in Rio from a friend. I listened to it for several weeks before making a final decision. These guys do in fact [stink]. They may have tons of energy on stage with an incredibly large and fancy stage show. Why does one need a large stage show? Because these guys know that they stink.Yanick is the worst guitarist ever, and the other two cool guys don't play very much of the solos. When they do it is smothered with reverb and delay.Bruce Dickinson has to be one of the worst vocalists of all time. He could have come straight out of an amature punk rock band. He is constantly off key, nasal, goofy sounding, feminine and a tad fruity. Is that what us metal fans want to hear? I don't think so."
3,This is not going to be any different from the PG-13 rated one,"Something tells me that this will be the same movie with just new special features.So,we are not going to get an unrated version of Scary Movie 3.All that we will get is new special features.Just wait and see.When this comes out I am going to rent this before I buy it.Also does anyone else notice that Scary Movie 3.5 is only 85 minutes long?Scary Movie 3.5 is not even as long as the original Scary Movie 3.You had better rent this before buying it."
1,Its time to end it.,"The first Scary Movie was fine, the second should have been an indication that the series should end, but the third is dreadful. Ripping off movies from The Matrix to Sighs with out even being remotely funny makes this movie is a real choir to watch. I don't know what to think about the success of this film but I know that this is the last Scary Movie for me."
5,An All-Time Favorite,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites. It made me laugh pretty much the whole way through. Sure there were a few lame, awkward jokes here and there, but that's par for the course in movies like this. Probably the best scene of the movie is right after the main character wins a rap contest and winds up getting thrown out of the club when he pulls his white sweatshirt hood on in a manner which makes him look like a member of a white supremacist group. There are also a lot of really good gags involving the little boy in the movie. He keeps getting run over and hit in various ways... sort of like Kenny from South Park. Although this type of humor isn't the kind of thing that everyone is likely to enjoy, if you liked the first two ""Scary Movie"" movies, then you'll probably like this one even more!"
5,"Wow, This Is Great!","Iam not very good at writing long reviews. But I must say this is my favorite of the Scary Movie Series. I even had to see it 3times! If you have seen Signs, The Ring, The Matrix, or 8 Mile it is even funnier."
4,Hilarious! Much Better Than the 2nd One!,"Scary Movie 2 had a very funny beginning *the Excorcist skit* but the rest of the movie was a bore. Scary Movie 3, on the other hand, had a rather stupid intro, but the rest of the movie was a riot. Of course, it centers around spoofs and goofy characters resulting in very stupid humor, but you can't help but find it enjoyable. This one centers around spoofs of ""The Ring"", ""Signs"", ""8 Mile"" and ""The Others."" It also features an array of celebrity charaters and cameos with everyone from Charlie Sheen and Pam Anderson to Queen Latifah and Macy Gray.If you want a movie to just laugh your butt off to, thsi is it. Don't expect anything earth shattering and if you don't have a sense of humor, don't bother! Having one is required viewing. ;)"
1,PATHETIC,"This video was not very interesting. Neither Pamela Anderson nor Charlie Sheen can act their way out of a paper bag. Although Pamela has her physical attributes to her credit, they can't carry the video. This was my first venture into the Scary Movie set and it probably will be my last."
5,Ended Up Being Surprised At How Good It Was,I thought this movie started out a bit slow but once it got rolling it never slowed down.The funeral scene had me crying and about to throw up because I was laughing so hard. I can honestly say that's the hardest I've ever laughed at a movie in my life. I literally had to stop watching so I missed a lot of it but that's cool because I'm gonna go see it again anyway.Definitely worth it for the laughs. A good time was had by all!
1,"Its all about ""The Ring"". Nothing special","I hated this movie, its very silly and boring. Its all about ""The Ring"". It finished very quickly and the ending sux!Nothing special!"
3,Outrageously Funny,"Probably the least vulgar and profane ""Scary Movie"" this film made me laugh out loud. I am honestly not a fan of the ""gross out comedy genre"" but for the genre it was really funny. There really is much substance to it, since there isn't a strand of serious plot. There were some great cameos, (Pam Anderson, etc.) If you are in a laughing mood see this film, but if you are looking for a serious film, don't even try to watch it."
2,Not worth watching.,"I'm a person with a sense of humor. I like comedy, funny movies and pranks. I also joke around alot. I didn't find Scary Movie 3 really funny or enjoyable though. There are parodies of horror movies such as the 'Ring' here, and even non horror movies such as '8 Mile'. The plot seems barely there, just thrown together. Its unrealistic, but thats not a problem(its a movie for crying out loud). The only remotely funny part was probably the Michael Jackson scene, or some of the 8 Mile spoof(kind of). If you're a complete moron, you might this this is a hilarious movie. You'll be rolling on the ground laughing! If you have at least an I.Q. over 5 though, you're bound to hate it."
5,Side Splittingly Funny!,"I can't even begin to explain how funny this movie is. It uses stupid humor to tickle the funny bone, and it sure does do it's job.This third installment of the famous series revolves around Cindy Campbell(the hilarious Anna Faris) and local farmer Tom Logan(Charlie Sheen.)

I was laughing so hard that my side was hurting and I couldn't breathe. (I have asthma!) SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT THE INHALER!!!"
2,Scary ? Funny ? Eh,"I went into this film knowing full well what I was getting myself into. I was prepared for sexy gratuitous sex, wacky violence and a zillion sight gags. Hell, I was even prepared for pop culture's method of hitting someone over the head with a rubber chicken. I get that Scary Movie 3 is a comedy and I should probably lose myself in it and have some fun. I did exactly that for the first fifteen minutes. Then the movie just regressed to being hopeless. I was hopeless to find something to laugh about, with OR at. There were a few good moments and then there was nothing else."
1,I only laughed a few times,Looks like this was basically a spoof of The Ring. The jokes were real silly and not very funny.
3,Scary Movie 3,"As a 13 year old girl.I think Scary movie 3 is a hillarious movie.It sucessful because it lamps up scenes from other famous movies but makes them funnier.The most outsanding part is when the main characters are being choked by aliens and they discover that choking really means hello. In another funny twist,an alien puts his fingers into the characters mouth and than explain that aliene uriata from their hands.This leads to a great vomit sequence.The best things about the movie are,how everything fits in and how there is a killer but the movie is funny. I just think the movie is cool the way it was made.I think this movie was made for everyone in a way.The worse thing about the movie is that the way they made jokes on Michal Jackson.In my opinion i think it it funny but harsh at the same time. they shouldn't push it so far.Maybe the film would be better if they had scary things,because they try to be scary but it is too funny.I also think they should add cartoon movies in it."
3,Not the greatest,"It could be said this movie is somewhat disappointing. It had its funny moments but it is nowhere near as hilarious as Scary Movie 2. Anna Faris and Regina Hall are as hilarous as ever but the biggest disappointment was the absence of the Wayans brothers. I will give credit to Queen Latifah, Eddie Griffith, Charlie Sheen, Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson for adding some humor to the movie. Plus George Carlin and Leslie Nielson were a comical touch. For fans of 'Signs"" and ""The Ring"" this movie will be up their alley but for me the thrills lacked along with the laughs. If people like it...enjoy! Good for them. This just wasn't a favorite for me."
4,"Nice watch, needs one (easy) tweak","I have one and I like it! I made one after-purchase tweak: I purchased somegreen ""Super Phos Phosphorescent Glow Paint"" from [...] and used it to apply a tiny amount of glow in the dark paint to the ""zero"" mark on the timer bezel. That makes the zero point on the bezel easier to find in the dark AND in the light. If you try this, be sure to use the paint described above from [...]. It does not require UV light to light up, the way that many other GITD paints do.- Tim"
2,Not a good purchase,"I purchased this watch as a gift for my adult son. I have always had really good experiences with Timex. He did not want a really expensive watch, as this was for work. The watch quits constantly. He has changed the battery and did not help at all. You have to take it off and jar it 2-3 times to start it again. Not reliable at all. Very disappointed."
3,Nothing Special,"This is not a particularly well made or thought out product. It jams more frequently than the manual Swingline models, although not so frequently as to be annoying to use. Less explicable is that the paper cannot be adjusted to place the staple within 3/8 of the top of the page. The finished product is usable, but lacks a professional appearance. When it comes time to replace the unit, I will look for something better."
2,Imagination is not scholarship,"I picked up this title because I found the idea compelling, but seeing so much of what could have been evocative became hyperbole, I could not recommend it. Nothing within this documentary could be construed as proof, yet everything is presented as such. It has all the hallmarks of snake-oil salesmen telling people what they want to hear. If the suppositions had been set aside and the material allowed to stand on it's own, it presents some interesting information, but the majority of the presentation misrepresents the facts, and often the content of the Bible in order to fit the narrative.I see this ultimately as something more damaging than encouraging, and suggest that anyone with a mind too weak to see through the distortions of this documentary not be exposed to it.I do hope that the research continues, perhaps in the hands of those without such a transparent agenda."
4,"Gentle, Probing Music","Erskine is the nominal leader of this trio, which as above also includes bassist Palle Danielsson and pianist John Taylor. Those familiar with Taylor's piano style will know what to expect--gentle, probing music and arrangements that give all three players prominent place in the proceedings. The recording was done in Oslo by engineer Jan Erik Kongshaug, so veteran ECM listeners will know what kind of sound to expect. This is a recording that rewards repeated listening, but which may strike some listeners as listless and boring. Beauty is in the ear of the beholder."
5,Nice bulbs!,I replaced the amber parking lights on my 07 Honda Fit with these bad boys to give it a little bit of personality. They are nice and bright and look great!
1,Very Dim,I upgraded (supposedly) all the exterior bulbs in my 2010 Soul. I did one side at a time to see the difference and I saw none. These were actually dimmer then stock. Would never by again ;( Don't waste your money
4,Sophisticated Text,This is required text for the CFA program and many business schools' security analysis curricula. This is an excellent text for advanced/professional investors and is not intended for the average do-it yourselfer.
1,Sloooooooooooooooooooooooow Game,"Anyone who think this game is the best ever must:a) Go for graphics more than content - looks good I'll admit, but the game play in the original Doom is better and more addictive than this and that was how many years ago?! They hope you'll go for image over atual content and, boy, does it seem to be workingb) Enjoy anything with ""Doom"" in the title - if this heap couldn't rely on the Doom legacy, does anyone really believe it would sell?c) Enjoy waiting for a long time before anything happens - first person shooter? More like a first person hiking trip (with your Grandma)d) Be unable to handle anything that requires actual thought - I know it's (supposed to be) a FPS, but am I the only one who gets real bored real quick with this type of completely linear gameplay?e) Work for the distributer or be related to the makersDon't waste your money like I did. Find an old copy of one of the first 2 Doom games and play until a decent sequel arrives."
1,ID Software,"I'm really thinking that all reviews having 5 stars have been written by people from ID Software. I'm a developer myself and I can see that they had a lot of work to do for this game. Unfortunatly the story is not very good, the single player mode is short and this is so dark you can't appreciate how the things were done. I almost forgot, I have a P4 2.6 GHz with a GeForce4 128 MB and I can play in a resolution of 640x480 and the fps must be like 15fps. I guess Microsoft is not innocent in that.Don't waste your money in this game - I think you better have to download the C64 emulator and play Great Gianna Sisters, you will enjoy more !!!"
2,Doom 3 - What a let down,"BORING TEDIOUS CRAPOk why?1) slow and jerky even on a fast machine2) ages loading level/saved game every time you die(have your gameboy handy)3) One dimensional, endless dark gloomy little spaces, and yes behind every door is the same monster - and when you kill him another appears behind you - predictable or what.So. dig out your(or your dad's) old 286 load up doom1 and get ripping - fast fun, humerous, big varied levels, different monsters - which can be made to attack eachother! play it again and again taking different routes through the levels, die and re-load in an instant.So what went wrong? smart arse geeks got carried away on far out graphics. pish - I want graphics I browse porn.(excuse the prophanities - I am a european)Seriously though - just buy Half Life 2"
5,beware you may never escape doom 3,"i don't exactly remember when i first bought doom 3 for my mac; but it was a couple of years back. All i have to say is, i have always been a mac person but once i got hooked on doom 3 multiplayer i eventually built my own high-end gaming pc to more fully enjoy this game. I am more or less completely obsessed by it; it's a lot of fun but again I warn you .. beware of this game because it may possess you for what looks to be ... forever? I have never tired of playing this game."
2,"Pretty graphics, but unoriginal and repetitive gameplay","This game looks good, but there is very little that is new in the gameplay. It really is just updated graphics applied to the original Doom. There's a lot of repetition too, so many stretches are boring and frustrating. And, most of the action takes place in the dark, so you can't see the pretty graphics most of the time! And why can't I use a flashlight and carry a weapon at the same time? It makes no sense.My recommendation: Save $20 and buy Far Cry. It's a much better game."
1,Bug ridden piece of Trash,"I have got to say this is the worst game I have ever played and I loved the first Doom.a) If I try to play Multiplayer, I always get CD Key in Use and it doesnt allow you to playb) I have mailed support loads of times, not one replyc) It is full of bugs, you join a game 1/4 and the server is always fulld) You select none passworded games and the games are passworded and you have to start again.e) The filter for ping rates doesnt work properlyThis is going back to the shop tommorrow as ID have delivered a pile of Rubbish."
2,"Unimpressive, in retrospect - EOY, 2007","This game got a lot of press when it was new. Dark, creepy, it marked a resurgence of horror FPS games and pressed the boundaries of the hardware of the day.As of Dec 2007, however, it doesn't do that any longer and there's darker, creepier, better written games out there. As we enter 2008, 8PM on a Thursday night, there are only ~10 people on all the servers that my copy found tonight. Doom3 might have a lot to be said for it in multiplayer mode, if people were still playing it, but they're not.If you're toying with buying this game today, buy it as a single player FPS, and buy it cheap. Half-Life2, Prey, and a half dozen other, better written, FPSes are available in the same 15-25 dollar price range. If you can find this game under $20 and have a deep love of id Games, go for it. If you'd rather just find a good single-player game, blow that $20 on something more compelling."
5,u have no clue,"doom 3 will be better than what u think, i bet u havnt even seen the game in action..."
2,What Were They Thinking?,"Doom 3 was a much anticipated disappointment. This is because the game consists of hours of monsters jumping out from walls behind you only to shoot you in the back. There is little innovation in this game and very few real challenges. The sameness is monotonous. Oh, yes, the graphics are quite nice, but even they have a similar look, sort of dark interior, mechanical corridors, mostly.I was disappointed that there were very few physical challenges, such as jumping over moving objects, nor were there any puzzling mental challenges to add some variety to the game. This game was so empty of fun, I rushed though it to get to the end. When I was done I could only think to myself, what were they (ID) thinking.So if you enjoy spinning around to kill the baddies, coming out of seemingly solid walls, constantly, by the thousands, then you might like this game."
2,Spooky. Great graphics. But can't see s***!,"(*Review based on Demo*)Perhaps many people go for the appeal of being left in the dark - and it definitely adds to the spookiness factor - but I just found it, well... annoying.80% of the game you're either in the dark or can't see but a few feet in front of you. Its sort of like trying to fight in a box... its just rediculous.There is nowhere to crouch down and hide or use any sort of tactics. Instead, you're just mindlessly running through areas, trying find stuff to shoot at.Seriously, you can't use a light-mounted gun this far in the future?? Considering our current military has this ground-breaking technology, it should be available in a future military base on Mars...Sorry, this game just didn't do it for me... download the demo before you blow your $50."
4,A little too scary?,"This is the best looking and completely absorbing game I've played to date, (closely followed by Call of Duty 2.) My only regret is that it is a little too immersing and scary to play with complete abandon, or for very long. Bloody, gore laden and dark atmospherically. That said: FANTASTIC!"
4,"Fantastic Visuals, Real Chills with just Average Gameplay","The visuals in Doom 3 are literally second to none. You really feel like you're inside another world. Morevoer, the darkness adds to a really creepy atmosphere. You really get a sense of chills as if you were watching a horror movie. It's the first time I've played a video game and literally have been scared out of my wits.All of that said, there are no breakthroughs here with regard to the actual gameplay itself. It's very good, but we've seen it all before. In fact, gameplay wise, this is on par with the original Doom. Since the advent of Grand Theft Auto III it has become more difficult to achieve higher expectations when the entire video game genre has moved towards more realistic 3 Dimesional worlds as a standard aspect of gameplay. Developers really need to reach deep to spark creative a new creative vein.Bottom line, visually stunning with average game play."
1,Save your $$$,"I can't believe how sad this game is. It's very dark. The graphics... BOOO!!! I am sure that most people that gave this 5 star rating have not played the game, or are really into the darkness and overall lameness of it? I've played it 3 days and it's like a kids map of running around trying to find card keys to access diffrent levels then you got to spend your time writting down codes for logs. What a bunch of B$!!! Dunno, I expected way better graphics... All I can say is WAIT for more reviews. Or check ebay since many are going to try to unload this. I am a big quake/doom/farcry/half life fan and this is a very big dissapointment to me since I really though/hoped this would be one of the better games. Saving up for better Far Cry and HL2."
5,"Scary as Hell, literally","wow, playing this game was like controlling a character in a horror film. it was just insanely crazy. graphics are insane, characters are wicked scary. this was not disappointing at all!"
4,Doom3,Good graphics easy to install easy to play. Very good instructions. Easy to understand and follow. I like this game
5,Doom 3 is the challenge to beat !,You have to be fast and swift. And be alert or you will be dead.This one is harder than the others.
5,clint eastwood thunderbolt and lightfoot,"a rare find for me, truly a classic, very happy to receive this dvd, kudos to my favorite site AMAZON!!! condition was mint, arrived early, and would do business with the anytime in future, actually i have many more titles in transit as we speak. cant say enough good things about AMAZON and their venders. thank you sincerely mike beaver"
4,Jeff Fan,"Very believable acting on the part of a young Jeff Bridges. A great paring of Bridges and Eastwood, both clever characters. Kept my interest throughout the film."
3,Not as what I expected,"I watched the trailer for this movie and it looked pretty good if your a clint eastwood fan, but i suggest you rent the movie first before you buy it, it drags in some places but does have some comedy and action scenes, its pretty pricey for a low budget flim"
1,thunderbolt,"DVD would not work - wrong region, would not play. The dealer called me a liar. Am in process of returning it and hope to get money back and will NEVER order thru that dealer again. You should check into this and make sure your customers are happy. I am NOT happy!!! jhw"
5,Fantastic Alternative,"This book is absolutely a perfect introduction into non-fiction books. My son loves the ease of reading and yet I feel it is challanging and educational. Very nicely written! Also, shipping was fast and on time."
4,educator,Good expository text. It is filled with rich information about the rainforest and it is explained in an easy way for second graders to comprehend. A must have for any rainforest thematic unit.
3,Tad bit better,It is a tad bit brighter but I will say looks a lot cooler. So take that for what its worth.
3,Sparkles Fall Off,"The hat is all right, except for the sparkles fall off. This is an issue because I have pets and I dont want them to get stuck in their paws."
2,Yet another textbook not for the beginner,"I sure wish Amazon had two ratings for technical books: One rating for experienced users, another for new learners. I'm of the latter. This book was a requirement for a Java course, and, I swear, the whole point of this turgid dull snippet-laden book was to make the teacher look good. The first chapter attempts to present overview-level Java concepts but throws you a table of primitive data types. No, I don't mind knowing how many bits are in a float, but could you please tell me about Java first? I'm sure this book is extremely useful for Java programmers, but students are well-advised to look elsewhere."
3,Girls With Hammers -1,I had such high hopes after reading girls with hammers first but this was a real letdown. The book took forever to get going and when it did Ms Chadwick undid all of her plot work by having the main character exit stage right.
5,may you be the mother of 100 sons,"This book is a really good way to understand the role of women and the culture in India. She takes you to all sorts of situations - a rural village, a Bollywood set, urban slums, etc. and really explores how the role of women is changing in some cases and very much stuck in the past in others."
1,Completely Clueless,"This book is an eyeopener. It illustrates the stereotypical western attitudes towards Indian culture and religion. The author lacks any true insight into the lives of the people she is writing about and carries on giving us her 2 cents anyway.Imagine if some Indian woman with no idea of western culture ""studied"" women by living in the US for 4 years and took it upon herself to write something as condescending about American women, society, culture and history, how would that turn out ? That is how ridiculously shallow this attempt is.Read Chitra Devakaruni, Jumpha Laheri, Bapsi Sidhwa, Veena Oldenburg ... this author has no clue ..."
1,"Haven't I seen this book before, but with a different title?","So what? I mean .. is that all there is? This book is just a re-hash of the same tips in the original ""Mr Excel On Excel"". If you own that book, there isn't much new here. The author had a chance to add descriptions about how things worked but instead included hundreds of nearly blank pages to write my own notes. If I wanted to keep my own notes, I would have bought a spiral-bound notebook for a dollar. Also, this book .. something about the grammer .. hard to understand at times."
2,Doesn't fit Skil Saw Table,"As others have said, this kit will only work if you drill new mounting holes that match up with your table. I have a new Skil Saw that came with a Skil table (not the folding type) and the holes do not match up. So, not sure what Skilsaw table this kit is for, but it didn't fit mine. It should be clear in the ad which Skil Saw tables this kit fits. Having said this, for the price it's not bad. Just be ready to drill to make it work for you."
1,Soo stooooooopid,This book is so stupid...it's obvious that a elementary school kid wrote this. Tries to be all philosophical and insightful and touching at the same time...the only thing it touched was my trash can after i got through the first 2 pages. Poor read...not even worthy for on-the-toilet perusal.P.S. I only put 1 star cuz I couldn't give it a 0.
3,Nicely Done,"Lovely pictures, well-written prose, but organizationally not very exciting. It's written for the non-practitioner (which I am), but lacks the imagination of other books on the same subject."
3,it is very useful for engineers,have been working for General Directorate of Highway in Turkey.I read this book four years ago.It was very useful.
4,Coxy@the Black Cross,"A solid 7th album from BLS, Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde proves once again that he is one of the greatest rock/metal guitarists of all time, not to mention a great vocalist. If you're new to BLS, just think Ozzy with a bit more grunt. Recently went to see BLS at JB'S in Wolverhampton, awesome gig + thanks to Moby and co. for the Freebies. To all S.D.M.Fers, BLEED BLACK F@#KING LABEL!p.s.To any nay sayers above (e.g. A kid), BLS is the future of metal! If you're idea of metal is getting involved in the politics, then F#@k off to number 10 and let the people who are interested in the MUSIC write a review. Maiden are great, yes, but that doesn't mean you have to disregard all other music in an immature show of some kind of twisted loyalty! Let bands moan at each other and don't get involved, when you don't know what went on. Think you should stick to watching C.I.T.V. in the future..."
2,Listen,"Really, if you are only going to listen to the good reviews, and dismiss the negative ones, just because you don't want to hear them, why would you even consider listening to music reviewed by anyone?Anyway, this album gets two stars for effort. Zakk Wylde is one of the most mediocre songwriters in ""metal"". Yes, their are a couple of catchy songs on this album, but only for the reasons of being repetitive. ""Fire it Up"" has three chords throughout the song. Seriously listen to what is being played, Zakk will sing the same line over, and over, and.....over again. The riffing is nothing special, I don't see the big deal really. Nothing against the man, he is just highly overrated. So, overall less than mediocre, boring, and repetitive songs. Nuff' said."
4,Refreshing sound !!!,I have read a review that Zakk is ripping off alice & chains who was also a great band. Man where do you think they got there influences on singing style from. Ozzy has ben singing like that since the 70's .This album is pretty good a couple of the songs are realy catchy the only thing I didnt like was some of the solos sound very familiar like they have been done before maybe I am mistaken. This was well worth the money an dose kick ass.
4,Raves For Rita,"This is a nice collection of Rita's work and a must for anyone who appreciates the sultry, sexy, smokey voice of this woman. The only thing I can say bad about this is it's not ""The Lady's Not For Sale"" one of her old A&M albums and until they bring that one out on Disc you'll really not have the best of Rita Coolidge! That one will be a 5 star cd. Until then...this is about the best that you can get."
4,Remixes of the band's late 1990s material,In the late 1990s the Creatures came back to life in a huge way. They released the ep Eraser Cuts and the album Anima Animus and this was among some of the best material ever. This is an album of remixes approved by the Creatures. A bunch of their dance music DJ fans decided to remix a lot of songs from this period and the Creatures picked the best of the lot. Its a really fun and interesting album yet should play second fiddle to the Creatures original material. Not an essential release but an excellent one indeed.
3,Target info good Methods of attack not so good,"I too agree with the other online reviewers.Most of Mr.Longs books contain valuable target info. He really goes into great detail about the cause and effects of striking these targets, and then the type of damage that would probably occur.You gain alot of info from reading most of his books.He no longer uses those silly costumes that he wore in his original book Dragon Touch { which is also very good if you overlook the techniques and the halloween costumes}.If you cross reference his material with a good medical text like Grants or Netters you will see that he is very accurate in his descriptions and locations. The only one that he was incorrect was pushing the noses septal cartilage into the crista galli which is physically impossible ,but other than that his works deserve a read."
5,Heartwarming & Quirky Irish Family Romance,"I absolutely loved this book! Five stars is not enough.This is my first Susan Donovan book. The repartee between Autumn ""Audie"" Adams and Stacey ""Quinn"" Quinn is precious. Quinn comes from a tight knit Irish family that shows its love for one another in every way. Audie comes from a family where she did not feel love, thus she acts flaky and refuses to let herself commit fully to any relationship. But that was before she met Quinn, a police detective that is fully deserving of her love if she can ever let herself go. He even offers to let her ""rent"" his family if she finds she can't live without them but won't commit to him.I thought Quinn was an excellent macho, fiercely loyal and giving character that was more than a match for Audie. Turnabout is fair play in the end where Audie must find it within herself to determine if she deserves what Quinn has offered."
5,A Good Book for Historical Perspective,"I can't even remember where I got this book. I read it many years ago while I was in engineering school (it wasn't even suggested, let along required reading - I was just into my subject).This is an old book, but it dose tell some good tales on the engineering of of some things that we just take for granted today. It's a short book, and it reads fast without a ton of technical jargon. If you're into tech/engineering, this book would be some good reading."
3,conair fabric steamer review,"GS10RH conair fabric steamer works good, but hose has to be kept upright in a vertical position or steam converted to water will concentrate in hose producing less steam. With this in mind and in practice the unit provides an acceptable performance. Easier than ironing a plus."
4,"Excellent Steamer, Excellent Price",I bought this last weekend and after reading the positive and negative reviews here I did not know what to expect. After 12 shirts and 3 pair of dress pants I am impressed. The crease attachment really works well. I am so impressed I am thinking about getting the GS-11 model for the 1400 watts and the locking casters. I got a great price on the GS-10 and it does a great job so I have not made up my mind yet on upgrading to the 1400. The reason I gave it 4 stars is you can not lock the casters. This was a slight problem on tile but on carpet it was not a problem.
1,Glorious Lack Of Sophistication,"Deep Lyrics man, I'm getting a lot out of this... But just wait for the next record when you'll get ""Hold On Loosely!"""
2,Don't Bother,Waste of time that I will never get back! Fails as a Yakuza movie. There has to be better Yakuza movies available.
3,A good but slow moving mafia movie that is worth watching. Plays like a Japanese Godfather. Could have been better. I say B,"""When Mr. Murase and I were in prison together we made a pact over saké."" After the head of a Yakuza family learns of his henchman's betrayal to a drug dealing family he starts a war that changes everything. This is a very good movie that is equal parts tense, bloody and dramatic. The only problem is that the flow seems off. Going from scenes of murder and finger cutting to long sequences of nothing happening makes it hard to get fully engrossed. On the other hand it is also a movie that forces you to keep watching in order to find out which family will ultimately win out. I did enjoy this but this is not a movie for everyone. A movie with no real good guy and leaves you watching not sure who to root for. I like movies like that. Overall, a good but slow movie that is almost an updated Japanese Godfather. I give it a B."
2,A little tedious.,"In a nutshell, the story is bleak, the excess of names convoluted, and the overall execution monotonous. The film is filled with cliches and it is more centered on creating conflict out of insignificant matters for the sake of justifying conflict and murder scenes than on actually developing a story or ever developing any character. If you like mafia films or Japanese productions then you might take a little liking in ""Outrage"" but if you just like good films, there isn't much here."
3,A Sad Reproduction,"If you are a true child of the 80's and want to buy this DVD to relive the memories, DON'T DO IT! It's nothing like the original. Not only do the characters look different, but they sound different, the songs aren't as catchy as it used to be and...it's just a very sad reproduction. I find it somewhat sacriligious to remake something that was excellant to begin with, not only that but to try to create something that was made in a totally different time. I feel that even though this particular DVD isn't lacking any morals it still lacks the qualities to make it the ""can't eat just one"" dvd of its time. I wish that the company would seriously consider re-releasing the originals and letting the public see how much better the orignals are."
5,Creative Labs WebCam NX Pro,"This webcam was worth every penny. I used similar logitech webcam ealier, this one is far superior quality for the same price in same product line."
4,Good even in low light,"I had a Logitech web cam before this one, but that performed poorly in low light, I returned that one to the dealer, and got this on an online deal for half the price and double the quality. It adjusts itself in low light, any kind of light really well, and gives great pictures."
4,problem uninstall software,I would like to report that I have difficulty uninstall the software. Someone else also said about this issue.
5,even better than i expected!,"it's easy to install, can easily be fixed on flat monitors with its three legs, and the picture quality is even better than i expected! strongly recommended."
2,not very good,It works well at the very beginning...but later i found1. it's too hard for it to stand still. it drives you mad b/c of this.2. the quality of pictures deteriorates over time. it cannot even focus now! what's happening?><..am i the only case?
4,works great,"I bought one for my gf and it worked great in video conference. the image is clear, well-exposed. better than my PD1030."
2,Let's Get real,"I am computer literate and have modern, fast gear. I was unable to get reasonable performance from the NX pro. My friend's logitech works somewhat better. Any movement at all created image problems on this unit. The manual is poor, support online weak. Creative products continue to operate as if it's still 1995. Even the driver hung up on two systems! Move along, folks...nothing to see here."
1,Can't load the Software on my Sony VAIO XP laptop,"The installation process hangs on 5%, it doesn't install. I tried two different installation software CDs with same result. Also, I had a very bad experience dealing with Creative customer services.However, I bought Creative's - WebCam Live model for my sister a month ago. It works very well. So, I have had good and bad experiences with Creative products."
2,BAD BAD video quality,"I purchased this webcam last month based on the ""good"" reviews here. The video quality is so bad and fuzzy that I couldn't even tell if the person in the webcam was really me!!I was also startled to find so many ""good"" and ""helpful"" reviews on this webcam here. I start to wonder where all those ""good"" reviews are coming from.... If those reviews were authentic, I wonder which antiques they were comparing with.I would have given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the smooth installation of the product.I already returned the product and got the refund - $4.99 on me because the product was not defective. And I just got the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 and it works perfect with great video/picture quality that you're able to tell who's who in the cam! Guys, to save your money and time, do not buy this Creative Labs PD1130 WebCam NX Pro. I highly recommend Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000."
2,The stand is pretty badly designed,"Picture quality is pretty good and it is easy to setup. However, the camera clip just does not do the job it is supposed to do. I can't get it to clip onto a laptop or stay firmly in place on top of monitor or for that matter anywhere else."
3,Contents of Princess Tales,"Thanks to Sleah from ABEbooks BookSleuth, I now know that the contents of this book are:The Practical PrincessThe Twelve Dancing PrincessesThe Princess and the VagaboneMelisandeThe HandkerchiefThe Blackbird's SongRicky-of-the-TuftThe Son of the Baker of BarraThought this might help others."
2,The Best CD I've Ever Heard,"Tom Russell's ""The Man From God Knows Where"" is quite simply the best CD I've ever heard in my life. The songwriting is brilliant as are the performances by Tom Russell, Dave Van Ronk, Iris DeMent, Dolores Keane and the rest.As a lover of folk music, I can say that this CD is also the best use of folk music forms I've ever heard. On a scale of 1-10, this ranks 25."
5,An extraordinary personal statement,"I heard Tom Russell on National Public Radio last weekend for the first time, and ordered this CD. It's amazing. It's like a narrated family picture album of his ancestors. The songs are haunting; I can't seem to turn it off!"
2,"Fur-Real Dog is durable, but it will make kids bored!","First of all, I think ours was called Fur-Real, not Go-Go, but they are the same. Second, this is boring. All you can do is brush it and call it. In fact, when you call, it dosen't come close enough. With this interactive My Pet Kitty by MGA you could use the keypad, enter the password, and tell it to play with the toy mouse. With Fur-Real Dog, you can brush, pet, call. No fun games to play with your pup. I named mine Puffy and I like to love Puffy, but it's not very fun. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
2,Cute but disappointing,"Got this for my 7 year old daughter. She had been begging for it for months. Since she had played with it at a friend's house, I thought it was a safe bet, but she was bored with it after two days. When you first get it out it seems really cool. But you quickly realize that it walks into walls far more often than it comes when you call. I was also unable to get it to perform ""guard mode"" or ""sleep mode"" at all. I'd say if you want something cute and fuzzy, try a hampster. It will teach your child responsibility and won't be boring after 48 hours."
5,Its totally cute!,"I love it! Its so cute! At first, whenever I called Vanilla {my walkin` pup} she went the wrong way! But after some training she came straight toward me. Its just like having a real dog! I really recommend this!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This has to be the biggest waste of money I've spent on a toy. It does not respond to sounds, it moves maybe a few inches if it moves at all. It's not soft or cuddly. It's just a noisy piece of junk. And I paid full price for this thing when it was a popular item. Not worth it even with the 60% off it's being offered for on this site. Can't even sell it at a yard sale. Ended up throwing it out."
2,Based on a true story,I was hoping this was a feel good based on a true story type of movie but boy i was wrong. It was depressing and the movie just dragged out. I love the true story and that he lived out his life on his own terms but i would've loved to see a different turn out on a positive note. The give the real christopher McCandless 5 stars but the movie gets 2.
5,A job well done!,"I live in remote Alaska and thought that I wouldn't like this movie because it seems ridiculous to me that someone would live in the wilderness without help, skills, or support from other people who know that place and how to survive in the uniqueness of a place. That said, I was very impressed with the angle on this story and the respect given to Chris and his choices, the people he encounter along the way, and his ending. It was nice to see the time evolve by moving back and forth within the course of his life and it was interesting to have narration from the sister. The pace was great and kept interest throughout, beautiful filming, and strong characterization. I just hope this movie doesn't cause others to attempt such dangerous adventures without more preparation and learning. Good job and Thanks for a great show."
3,So what's the big deal with this guy???,"Their were things I liked about the movie, and things I didn't like. Let's start with what I did like: Good outdoor scenery, great photography, decent acting (not oscar-worthy, but decent). But I didn't like how the move made him out to be some sort of hero. What he did wasn't impressive, it takes no skill, and isn't all that interesting of a story: He hitchhiked across America to Alaska, tried to live off the land but died because he is neither prepared or knowledgeable enough of the outdoors. Are we supposed to look up to this guy??? I also didn't like how it portrayed him as both confused and hurting, but conversely as also a deep-thinking, philosophical, enlightning person."
4,Makes you think,I really liked this movie for the fact that it gets you to think about nature and life without the monetary possessions. Great soundtrack!
1,Hated it,A very well made movie about a troubled young man who did an ultimately stupid thing for no good reason. Why his story is glorified makes no sense. It's a sad tale. That's all.
2,Into the Idiocy,"A film made of rubbish. Let me sum it up: *chris* excuse me, ""Alex"" embarks on an eye opening enlightened ""journey"" to Alaska. Roll the Eddie Vedder music. *Chris articulates a profound cliched point* for instance, the dialogue between Chris and Mr Franz: ""Mr Franz when you want something in life you gotta reach out and grab it"". Really Chris? So it breaks into more Eddie Vedder music and then he eventually dies. I love how he thought society was such a bad place with all the LIFE experience he had. I mean he just graduated college but he knows about the trials and tribulations of what it means to live a life and function in society. Also, how selfish was he by not calling his parents - ok if not his parents, perhaps his sister, who it was obvious they were pretty close with each other. Speaking of his sister, she was how old? 15-16? She was spouting out some pretty advanced vocabulary for someone her age. This movie tried extremely hard."
1,Sorry - really great but sick,"Hey, the film had wonderful AK scenery (how could it not) and it had several pretty good actors (Chris wasn't one) but in the final analysis - it was a really well crafted travelogue film about a kid who was mentally ill, and the end result is quite unappealing. Would never watch it again."
1,problems!!,I did not get my product ..and..I sent many emails and looks like nobody care!! I am soooooooo SAD!!!!!
2,There's going to be a lot of head rolls...,"This movie is great if you enjoy poverty but not great if you are looking to come up out of it. I felt this movie was a tedious romanticizing of poverty and starving to death in a bus in the middle of Alaska. Supertramp should have gone to Wall Street and lived a happy life. He comes to the conclusion that a writer must deny himself beautiful women and proper sanitation in order to be a true poet. I disagree with the entire premise. He just needed a proper girlfriend and some money, that is all. I hope aspiring writers don't try this home. Go to Wall Street and get a girlfriend who loves you, that's my advice."
3,Into the wild,Kept waiting for it to get better and it never really did. Very disappointed in this movie not good not bad
3,Too long,"Good movie, but I think it was a bit too long...it could have been condensed and still would be enjoyable."
5,Great service,"Great movie, really love it. Such a sad ending though.... I'm glad i got it so soon, it was for a birthday present, thanks for the great service."
2,Inexplicable scene,"I thought overall the film was interesting, but a little slow. What ruined it for me was the scene where Alex looks directly into the camera and mugs. If this was supposed to be a documentary,it would be OK. But it's not, so all believability was out the window for me at that point.By the way, another reviewer's Geico caveman comment was spot-on."
1,"An homage to neurosis, self-destruction, and self-absorption","Withdrawal from the world is not a quality worthy of admiration. There is nothing compelling about this film. The story it tells is not admirable in my humble opinion.If you want a movie with a moral, watch something else. If you want a movie with a compelling narrative, watch something else. If you want a movie with a character who places his own profundity over the lives of others, then watch this movie."
1,SPOILER,"This movie is crap. If you're a dirty hippie and like dirty hippie movies, you'll probably like this.SPOILER ALERT!!!He's an idiot and of course he dies... you thought it end differently?"
2,It's not good...,This movie isn't good because it was bored. This movie story was no good and it was too difficult. This movie was not fun and exciting. I didn't enjoy this movie.
4,Failing to Connect,"This is a true story. I attended the same university as this young man and the film almost broke my heart. It is definitely worth seeing, but very sad. Emory is full of some very smart and very privileged young men and women. I think this boy confused rejecting consumerism with rejecting people in general. He tries to make his life meaningful by turning his back on his family and materialism. His search for meaning is tragic and very hurtful to his family because they really love him and never know what is happening with him. I believe that the ultimate meaning in our lives can only be found through love and connection. His failure to really connect with self love and love for others is what ultimately killed him. The film is beautiful and worthwhile to watch, but not lightweight or uplifting. Power Path to Love"
5,Wonderful - A Winner!,"Let me start off by stating that Thomas H. Cook is my favorite author. I've read all his books and loved each and every one. They are haunting, lyrical and intelligently written.""Into the Web"" is no exception...It's a spellbinding psychological mystery with many unexpected twists and turns.Basically it tells the story of Roy Slater who left his home in Kingdom County after a double murder that rocked the community and his family. Now after 20 years, returning to care for his dying father, he uncovers startling truths about the homicides, his family and the townpeople.Thomas Cook has a magical way of weaving a story that builds interest from the very first page to a shocking and satisfying conclusion.Along with his other books, ""Into the Web"" is a winner!"
4,"sharp, sad, painful, true","A harrowing account of the end of a love story. Captures perfectly the sickening emotional roller coaster of a breakup, the awful ride from hope to despair, and every other emotion in between, over and over and over. Anyone who has been there knows how hard it is to get off that damn ride. In the end, Texier is able to free herself by the very act of writing. I say: thank you for this book."
3,Wow!!,"This book is a very heartfelt account of what this woman went through during the course of her breakup. Although not objectively written, we were still able to get a very visual image of the pain that continously loomed over head every day. We also see the trauma that the whole ordeal had left on the poor kids, who really had nothing to do with it and who in the long run cannot erase it as easily Catherine. It seems to me that both parents were very selfish in their own ways and the new girlfriend should have never gotten involved in any way with the kids or Catherine for that matter. It is a very insightful book and Catherine Texier does have a huge amount of talent but it should be used elsewhere where she could have a succesful carreer as a fiction novelist."
2,A performative contradiction,"The point of these confessional memoirs is to let us into how self-aware other people are--or at least that's something that's often claimed about them. But Texier's own unselfawareness, her own unwillingness to really be self critical beyond a few scattered moments, her inability to get beyond the sarcastic and repeated question, ""what did I do to you,"" point up the difference between life and art. Texier confuses sex and love, and thinks that she can bind this man to her continually, even though he explains that he doesn't love her anymore, by passionate and wild sex, and then asks in a condescending and obviously insincere way, ""so what did I do wrong?"" This memoir demonstrates the narcissistic self-obsession that probably caused the relationship to collapse in the first place. It gets two stars because it generates a sort of voyeuristic sex based need to keep on reading, almost against one's will."
3,Good book for Newbies but otherwise not very helpful.,"I was a disappointed by this promising little book after ordering based upon it's title, which seems to speak directly to users of insulin AND the overwhelming positive reviews. My issue with the book is that it is EXTREMELY basic, even remedial in the way it explains everything through cheesy imaginary dialogues between a ficticous diabetic patient and his doctors, etc. If you have just been diagnosed diabetic or simply know nothing about diabetes this may be a good starter book for you. If you are however a long time diabetic who just recently began using insulin (like myself) this book will likely seem condescending and uninformative. For me the book was a waste of money. Thankfully I only paid one cent +S/H....$4.00. I think the key here is to describe this book as a BEGINNERS book. As such it's ok, otherwise I still highly recommend ""Think Like a Pancreas"" by Gary Scheiner as the ultimate guide for diabetics new to insulin."
3,You (sorta) get what you pay for,"This unit seemed a good value at first, but after some time had passed it did show its bad side. It has serious issues in correctly playing dual-layer dvd's, and on occasion freezes up and has to be unplugged to reset it. This does not, however, fix the dual-layer dvd problem, which persists no matter what. And yes, those same dvd's do play perfectly on other players.The biggest ""gotcha"" on this product is a complete LACK of any sort of help or response from the manufacturer to fix these problems. No fixes, upgrades, suggestions, nothing. Just ""oops, guess you better buy another one"". This unit was put out there as a throwaway, and if you just need something to play a few dvd's until you can buy a real player, this is a pretty cheap way to do it. If you're wanting this to be there for the long haul, you'll be gravely disappointed."
4,Good Book,"This is a good book for those who have faith, but are losing it because of why me? When you are suffering or hurting due to health problems, or whatever, you tend to ask God ""Why Me?"" It helps to answer this question by quoting the bible to help get you through your time of suffering and turmoil. It helped myself and my mother as she was suffering through Ovarian Cancer. She told me that it helped her tremendously."
2,Has Potential,"Wish I could give this 2.5 stars. This CD could be great except for the fact that Cherokee primarily covers one topic: SEX. Ya'll may be mad at me but it's the truth. Her voice is really unique - reminds me of Yazarah. And I liked some of the beats; it's just I'm looking for more than ""I made eye contact with this fine brotha, then brought him to my crib and broke him off"". No..that's not an exact quote but a summary of most of the songs. If you want lyrical depth - you will not find it here. But I see the potential.."
5,I think this is their best album.,"Castle Walls and Man in the Wilderness are two of the best, unheard songs that I know of. Just AWESOME!!!"
5,Most Diverse,"Every song here is good. Well, Superstars and The Grand Finale are a bit campy, but the other songs are completely worth it. Miss America, Man in the Wilderness and Castle Walls become mainstays after the thrill is gone from The Grand Illusion, Fooling Yourself and Come Sail Away. Definately in their prime."
4,"Welcome to Stardom, boys!","Fuelled by the crossover success of ""Come Sail Away"", Styx moved from a modest level of success to stardom with ""The Grand Illusion"". This is the point in Styx's career that has aged the best - several of the songs, notably ""The Grand Illusion"", ""Miss America"" and ""Man In The Wilderness"", still sound fresh today. Were it not for the weak ""Superstars"" and ""Fooling Yourself"" (the most dated sounding song on the album), this album would border on 5 stars. A&M records was becoming impatient with the band and was wanting a bigger seller from the band after ""Crystal Ball"". It remains remarkable to me to this day that the band found a huge breakthrough with the album that - to this point - was the farthest from having a top 40 focus. For Styx - success was no longer a grand illusion."
4,A Saga of courage and perseverance,"I found the book most interesting especially because of the historical insights that the author shared about life in Russia, China and finally in Australia. The contrasts between life in the Far East and life now in Australia for Gary and his family is amazing and it is wonderful to note the appreciation he has for the differences.I always love stories about people and what they have coped with in their lives. Certainly Gary Nash will have inherited some of the strong and stoic qualities that his grandmother showed.I found the book very enjoyable to read and the family tree was very useful to continuously revert back to as the story progressed. It has also been written in a very positive way and I would guess that this is why the Tarasov family managed to get to Australia and be successful.Most enjoyable - well worth reading!"
4,Good vanity for the price,"I ordered two of these vanities as Christmas gifts for my daughters. I was impressed by how well they were packaged. Assembly was straight forward. We had two issues though:1. A wooden support that holds up the mirror was cracked and broke during assembly. It split with the grain of the wood so I was able to glue and clamp it back together. Once the glue dried the repair was not visible.2. One of the special nuts used to secure a screw was not threaded all the way through and would not accept the screw. We were able to get a replacement at the hardware store and assemble the piece. No extra screws/nuts are provided in the package.Despite the two issues above, the vanities are nice and I am pleased with the purchase.Thank you."
3,So so,"Brought it brand new. The ear piece really do not fit the ear canal well. The phone seems to work well at the beginning of the call and once you talk too long, it will drop the call for no reason at all. I had it for two weeks before I lost it. I do not regret losing it. I would not recommend this item."
1,It's a bad one,"1. The volume is low2. In about 2 min in the conversation the sound goes to complete silence. The people on the other side still hear me, but it doesn't help since you think the phone lost the call. I tried it with 2 different phones with the same result."
1,pathetic horror novie,"ITEM WAS RECIEVED IN TIMELY FASHION,WAS IN PERFECT COND.,BUT IF YOU GOT MORE THAN A SLIGHT CHUCKLE BECAUSE OF HOW PATHETIC IT WAS, THEN YOU HAVE NEVER HAVE SEEN A REAL HORROR MOVIE."
4,The Awakening,I love Kate Chopin and the stories were great...the condition of the book was not bad either...
5,Excellent Cymbal,"The cymbal sounds great. It was not shipped well, however. It was not padded and was loose in an oversized box. Surprisingly, it wasn't damaged."
2,Not how I imagined it would work.,"The product quality is great, and worth the money. The reason I rated 2 stars is because in actual use, having a guitar strap hanging off the neck by the tuning machines is not so ideal. The strap gets in the way of your hand when you fret on the 1st and 2nd. I ended up having a luthier mount a button on my guitar and it works much better. I didn't want to put a hole in the guitar but it ended up being the best choice, I just hope one day I wont regret it by having the wood split."
5,Holds guitar well,"This little thing does it's job. Two separate pieces, one loops around the headstock, one around the strap, then they've got a little plastic clippy that latches the two together. No tying, quick and easy to connect or disconnect."
5,Works well,"I read reviews about this being a safer option for an acoustic guitar strap support than the usual tie-device. Working just fine so far, came quickly in the mail."
2,"Helps with the carpal tunnel, but wears quickly","This Kensington mouse pad definitely helps reduce my CTS pain, about as much as the Handstands Ergo-Mat Memory Foam mousepad which sells elsewhere on Amazon for the same price. I've used both pretty heavily for a year now.HOWEVER, the Ergo-Mat still looks like new - and I mean absolutely just-unwrapped new. In contrast, this Kensington pad is ready for the trash, with the surface degrading and color gone at all wear points. Even the gel pad is sagging. If it wasn't mine, I wouldn't touch it.And the layout is silly, with extra material off to the right where your hand will rarely go, and not enough area where it matters. This is continually annoying during use.So - whether or not the Handstands pad appeals to you, I'd pass on this Kensington item. It's way overpriced considering its poor quality. Kensington has sacrificed function for style, and you soon lose the latter because of the cheap materials. Typical big-company approach."
2,Wasn't AT all what I expected,"This product cost WAY too much for what it does, which is Nothing...I would not give my Okay on this item in anyway. It is too small and just doesn't do what it stated it would do. Don't get stuck with this item.."
4,"Sure, an this is a blessing!",I was happy that this CD came in time for St. Patrick's Day. And it is certainly a jolly listening experience. Thank you!
4,Good,"A classic. ""Blue Collar Man"" and ""Renegade"" were top 40 hits. I still think they are some of the best they put out."
5,this opratic rock group is the classical music of century 20 rivaling Mozart and the like!,"The three mid seventies albumns are by far the best of Styx. Starting with ""Crystal Ball"", ""Grand Illusion"", and finally this one with the odd time dialated cover. I am listening to my CD via PC speaker auxilery hook up now!(because I HATE media players!) If you like great music you can't not like this! It has the incredible beats of percussion and drums and the screaching(mid range) voice of James Yong and the elvan sounding Denis De'Yong. Let's not forget Young's hard mid sounds on gitar and Shaw's masterful leads. IF you want to be uplifted(or go sailing) this is the music to listen too! I don't care if these guys belly ached alot about thier ""Lives"" in their VH 1 interviews, is it not uncommon that artists are sufferers who want others to feel as they do! Mozart, Beatoven, Picasso, George ""friggen"" Lucas for c's sake!nuff told!"
3,Not what it used to be...,"Somehow my memory failed me....yes, it's got a couple of ""great hits"", but only a couple. For some reason I thought the album had more depth / breadth"
2,book purchase review,I have a retired teacher who works with struggling readers at my school and she asked for this book since it has seasonal poems in it. I was happy to find it at a very reasonable price and it arrived quickly.
4,Great recipes!,I was looking for some good chili recipes that are reasonably simple to prepare with ingredients I would normally have on hand and this is the book I found. It has some easy recipes and some more complicated recipes. Lots of good information.
3,Inconsistent,"30 years after its release, this album is now only remembered for its exceptional title track. Upon its release, Styx fans who had loved the band's previous release, ""Equinox"", felt initially that the band was slowly selling out. The band had been playing with commercial sounds before, but the lyrics were becoming bubblegum on songs like ""Put Me On"" and ""Mademoiselle"". At the same time, the title track, the solid ""Jennifer"" and the closing track, ""Ballerina"", showed some rawer emotions from a band that had generally been known for its working-class style until now. ""Crystal Ball"" is certainly not a disaster for the band; it was simply a so-so step on their journey to arena rock superstardom."
5,excellent disc that lies between two masterpieces.,I can't fault styx on this one in the least it's very well made prog rock and it's still commercial with great songs. It's not as perfect as 'equinox' or 'the grand illusion' but it's sure filled with excellent songs. This isn't a power pop one as latter styx could throw out. I loved those too though. Mr roboto is highly underrated in my opinion but lets be fair this is a cut above styx in that era still. It was a solid disc at it's time and it's still very enjoyable to the max.
4,Another win by Dan Abnett,"This takes a bit of a different tone than the earlier books in the series, in a way setting the tone for the later volumes. Great character development, loads of action and the quality that's Dan Abnett make this a great choice and a must have in your Black Library collection."
1,Not sure they are real,The last purchase I made at Amazon seemed like an inferior product. I've bought the same exact spark plugs before 2 times from auto stores and saw an immediate improvement in usage. The ones I bought from Amazon seemed as if they were worse than the originals I replaced. I believe them to be bootleg.
1,Terrible,"Of the many corporate rock bands that dominated the late 70's and early 80's Styx was among the worst. Led with two horrific lead singers in Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw, the band created the musical equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard, and with this album started trending into wimpy mush like ""Babe,"" and ""First Time."" Rock and roll had sold its soul to the highest bidder at this point and time and this was one of the worst examples."
5,Poppish But Rocking Good,"Although it was a bit pop at times, it still is better than having it as an orchestra. It mixed in a lot this time, which is good. Variety is Styx motto, so this album is a Pop Rock style, is good."
4,"Strange, yet still good cd","For me, this is one of the more strange Styx CDs. I was surprised to listen to the song Love in the midnight from Tommy Shaw. Still, somehow this cd works. Boat on the river is a good acoustic sounding song. I also like Lights, if for no other reason than it's not a song that sounds like anything else. The weakest song on the cd for me is also Styx' biggest hit, Babe. I think Dennis DeYoung has had much better ballads before and after this cd, yet somehow this is the one that became their biggest hit.Still, if you're a Styx fan, you should get this cd."
3,A lot of tools,"Defnitely a nice variety of tools and is very useful for many different projects. I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who loves to build and repair PCs and was in need of a good tool set.I've tinkered with it myself a few times and the only real downside to this set is the large, yellow screwdriver with the interchangable tips doesn't hold or lock in the tips, so they usually fall out when we try to use it. It also doesn't lock to prevent it from simply twirling around and not actually screwing the screw in. There weren't any sort of instructions with it on how to use any of the ""special"" tools in there (such as the yellow screwdriver and how to get the tips to stay in it), so if you're not sure how something works or what it is exactly, you're pretty much just stuck with a tool that'll sit there and do nothing, which I guess isn't so horrible because if you don't know what it is, I guess you don't need it. :P"
5,Highly recomended,"This book is an excellent source for material concerning skeletal muscle from the molecular level to physical application. This book is a graduate level book with as up to date information as is possible short of actual journal articles. This book would make a great addition to any library. I recomend this book to all persons interested in becoming (or current)physical therapists, exercise and muscle physiologists etc. If you are a professor at the college level and teaching >400 or graduate level classes consider this one."
2,Propaganda for the Tank Destroyer Corps,"This book was a bit of a disappointment. I was looking for the history of the TD corps, and it is there, but most of the book seems to be a propaganda pitch for the TD corps - beating the Germans at every turn, M-10's taking numerous hits and still going. Knocking out Tigers routinely. Taking on German tanks with halftrack mounted anti-tank guns and winning routinely. Golly, I have no idea why we lost so many tanks during the war, just send in the TD's - if Superman isn't available.I was hoping for an answer to the more puzzling question of why the US didn't use it's superb 90mm AA guns as anti-tank weapons like the German 88, but regrettably that wasn't addressed. The book does have some nice history and it's nice to read the action accounts. But I get the distinct feeling these guys weren't as spectacularly successful as they let on, especially since the TD corps was disbanded right after the war."
3,Obscure Gershwin Pieces,"This is a great selection of lesser-known Gershwin tunes from four of his shows: Funny Face, Oh Kay!, Of Thee I Sing, and Strike Up the Band. There are also a few standards included in this selection like ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""The Man I Love,"" ""'S Wonderful,"" and ""I've Got a Crush on You."" It also includes, ""Who Cares,"" ""Funny Face,"" ""Do-Do-Do,"" and many more.Over all, the arrangements are pretty good... pretty standard fare for these sort of songs. They're reasonably easy to play as written, and include chord symbols and lyrics."
1,It's Like a Film Festival in Purgatory,"My quick advice: if you love Davies and you've read absolutely everything else, nothing I say will stop you.If you love Davies and there's something else you haven't read, go read it before this one.If you haven't read Davies, please, please don't start here because this is awful and just not indicative of what a great writer he is.Davies was clearly touched by a bit of nostalgia, did some digging into his family tree and then decided to build a long boring story around it. The book is deceptive because it starts out as a murder and you expect to witness the ghost inflict revenge in some cunning fashion. No such excitement. Try two hundred years of immigrant movements disguised as one of those excruciating never ending black and white marathon film festivals. If this makes no sense the book probably won't either."
3,A murdered man's narrative of his past,"In this rather unevenly crafted novel, Davies has some clever ideas and interesting stories - along with the ever present Davies humor - but there are long sections of the book that 'drag' and fail to hold the reader's interest. My impression of this book is that Davies came up with a clever format and some intriguing ideas, but did not successfully bring these to fruition. Thus the rating of 5. Davies has better things to offer in his trilogies."
3,Murther and Walking Spirits,"This book is not intellectually demanding, but for what it is, is light, pleasant reading. It gives one person's view of Canadian history from 1776 to the present, weaving the dead (but participating) protagonist's forbears into a plot laced with sympathy and occasionally wry (Canadian?) humor. I found it a rewarding read, and don't hesitate recommending it to others with an interest in history and Europe's contribution to modern-day North America."
2,BEar phoned this one in,"It's sad, since I am such a big fan of Greg Bear's work, but I didn't care for this one. It really felt poorly put together, quickly executed and shoddily ended. It seemed to lack the care and work his other books have. Seemed desparate to have it optioned fo a movie (ugh, it probably will be). Bummer..."
3,Really freaking weird....,"This is the first time that I have read a book that has been penned by this author...and man is this guy touched!!! There were times that I had a hard time getting through this small novel...most, if not all of the concepts in this book were unbelievable...it was not scary at all...just very weird!!! Would I read another book by this same author.....probably NOT!!!! Book was very un-BEARABLE!!!! Sorry for the pun...had to do it!!!"
4,Brassy KICKS!,"If you're not familiar with Muffin Spencer's rough, tough kickin' dance music you need some time for ""Gettin Wise.""She's ""every"" strong woman gives new meaning to the words self esteme. The backing vocals and scratching are a blast.This album is more fleshed out than ""Work it Out."" You feel like you're getting more for your $$.Plug it in, turn it up and groove."
4,I am a wife of COA,I found this book very helpful tounderstand my husbands behavior toward our relationship. I am still lost though. Because if only I could get him to read it. But I need to help myself and my family. Does anyone know of a book who will help the spouse of a COA. I've read codependency books ect. But they are all geared to the one with the desease. But I know I am sick also. But can't seem to find myself in them. I've also attend ALANON but haven't been able to find peace. Can anyone suggest any books?
3,Not A Bad Collection - But There Are Better Ones!,"This fourteen track 60's collection is good but could have been better had it been a 2-cd set. There are some serious deletions here such as The Mamas & Papas (Monday Monday or California Dreaming) , Lovin' Spoonful (Do You Believe In Magic or You Didn't Have To Be So Nice), Creedence Clearwater (Proud Mary or Bad Moon Rising) to name just a few. You do, however, have some great songs here such as ""Turn, Turn, Turn"" by The Byrds, ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" by Roy Orbison, ""Kicks"" by Paul Revere & The Raiders, ""Sunshine Superman"" by Donovan, and ""Down On Me"" by Big Brother & The Holding Company, etc. For an even better collection I would suggest the 2-cd set entitled ""Positively 60's""."
1,Worst money I have ever spent on an appliance,"This item never worked! I received it and when I plugged it in to use the very first time, the motor hummed for a couple of seconds, then popped with a bright spark and smoke. Then, obviously would not work again. Granted, I did not expect a top of the line grain mill for $50, but I at least expected it to work at all. It even appears cheaply made. This is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this. Hopefully I will get a refund. I chose 1 star because the review program won't let me choose 0."
1,scratched DVDs due to incompetent package and packing,"if you have a dvd-cleaner, and if you enjoy repeatedly re-cleaning dvds, you might extract enough bits and pieces of episodes to give you a flavor of what these shows are about, but then you'd be eager to buy from somewhere else that doesn't ship scratched dvds. Discs 1 and 3 were packed upside down so they scratched each other when the hinged package closed.I haven't yet found time to investigate discs 2 and 4."
3,Missing something,"While this is a decent CD some essentials are missing. She came in through the bathroom window, Joe's first hit is not included. This collection was also released prior to the release of Up where we belong and When the night comes."
2,Stone color not brilliant enough,The design is nice; however the stone color is a bit of a dissppointment. It is a dull yellowish green and not very sparkly.
3,Loved everything about this series except.....,"The ""Konrad"" series is one of my favorites from the Warhammer world. You really have sympathy for Konrad, his plight and sufferings. You also get a great sense of redemption as he performs some truly heroic deeds. Ferring also has terrific prose style and uses great descriptions, dialogue and settings. They're also great for fans of the macabre too since most of Konrad's adventures have him in some truly terrifying places. Spoilers below, don't read if you haven't read the book...........I gave Warblade only 3 stars because of the terrible lack of effort with the ending of the series. It felt like David Ferring was under editorial pressure and had to deliver the goods quick. For a trilogy with so much build-up, the ending was a drop-dead anti-climax and left the reader feeling like they had been punched in the gut. It's really too bad. Still though, I'd like to see another Konrad book written."
1,Buyers beware! I was totally screwed over,buyers beware- i bought a medium rhine stone hoodie but recieved a 2xl black hoodie and he wouldnt let me return this
2,Disappointing...,"Very light and thin, won't keep you warm on a cold night. Extremely disappointed when I opened the large shipping box to find that the comfortor package was small (compared to package size for my standard non-down king comforter). Fluffing didn't help much. Description says 100% down fill, label reads minimum 75% down fill. Color (which was main attraction of this one over others) is very pretty - dark purple but with a trend towards reddish tones. Will keep as returning hassles/shipping fees aren't worth it and comforter will do for warmer weather. Overall I have seen better comforters at this price point and I would not have purchased this product if I had seen it first especially not at this price."
3,Hmm...,"Well, I love the color...I really really liked the price....basically it comes down to - I got what I paid for. Its not the best quality, but what do I expect...I paid $29.99 for it. In all honesty it doesnt really keep you warm....I mean not that it gets that cold here in Mesa...but yeah. This will probably just turn into an 'extra' blanket."
3,The color is more dark than its show on picture!,I just got mine. The quality just so-so. I order the purple set but the color looks like black. It is more dark than it shows on picture.
1,Bad Business,"Like others, Amazon canceled my $272.00 order as well due to a ""price error"" but shipped the universal base (not free anymore) anyway. We ordered an accessory from another vendor and that's shipping, but we'll have no saw to use it with. We'll have to ship it back at OUR EXPENSE (heavy item).I know Amazon sold this saw in early Sept. for $300.00 shipped, so why not offer it to us at that price instead of just canceling the order? I called their cust. service several times but was basically given the run around. I know a couple of people who ordered this saw as well and are very unhappy with the way this was handled. Amazon should be aware that it's a competitive marketplace out there, there are many other places to spend our hard earned dollars.I've had general good luck with Amazon, but not this time. They should honor the price."
1,Kinda Crappy,"Not my favorite read. Repetitive, boring, and filled to the brim with common knowledge crap that we have all heard before. Would not recommend this book at all. Coming from a broken home is not a pre-req for falling out of love with oneself, note to author. Author didn't make me love myself, just made me dislike this book. Merely my opinion."
1,don't bother,"The book doesn't make any attempts to help you all in love with yourself , she goes on and on about your childhood , parenting and nothing else about loving you ......!!!!"
4,Good Book...,"This book is a self-help book, which opens up your eyes to issues and problems dug deep below your surface. This book can be useful to anyone and everyone... Self-worth is something learned and practiced. Great book!"
5,"Why don't you own this already, silly?","The music itself is incredible. Its got a kind of jazzy-folkish feel that can't really be pinned down to one genre. A lot of 3/4 time as well, which you don't see as much in pop music. And yes, a trumpet. They're all very talented musicians. Plus, Alex Kapranos' intelligent sense of humour, and intelligence in general, really shine through in the lyrics, especially in songs like ""Divorce at High Noon"", ""To His Coy Dietress"", ""Life in a Barret Garret"", ""Garavurghty Butes"", etc, etc. ""The Infinite Duration"" also has some killer subtlety going on. Really really awesome stuff. You'll love it. Trust me. (..even if its nothing at all like Franz Ferdinand)"
4,Dust,"Good story and makes you think, keeps you thinking what might happen but also has a feeling of sadness throughout the story."
2,"OK, but not their best","There are a few decent songs here, but the special energy that Supertramp had on all their classic albums is gone here, and this is becoming a bit annoying at times, particularly Rick's writing which by now has gotten lazy. With a title like ""Put On Your Old Brown Shoes"", you just KNOW it's going to be some lame pseudo-jazz uptempo thing by Rick. Hodgson's stuff is starting to get whiny rather than positive - ""Crazy"" and ""C'est Le Bon"" are decent songs with nice melodies and hooks, though less original than his offerings on previous albums. The only song that was even a moderate hit, ""It's Raining Again"" is a decent song, but compared to previous albums, it's more of a jingle than anything else, with not-so-great lyrics (come on you little fighter / no need to get up-tighter). Overall, the lyrics are dark and despairing, and point the way to Roger's departure from the band, which goes out with a whimper not a bang."
4,Beautiful and valuable.,"An exquisite collection of mostly American posters. Most are from the last century, with a healthy sampling from WWI and WWII, as well as sampling of rock art, commercial posters, and sports posters. A great strenth of the book is the attention it devotes to the representations and self-representations of women and ethnic minorities. Some of the most powerful pieces in the book are the many protest posters from the 1960s and 1970s. The book offers minimal text to analyze the work; instead concentrating on high quality prints from an excellent and wide-ranging assortment of American posters. A valuable and beautiful fragment of history."
3,10 minute film with no surprises,"The description tells it all. Good plot that producers would do well to expand on. Reminds me of a extremely short version of ""The Bad Seed."""
5,Outstanding,"Arrived on time, perfect condition.An awesome book from professor John Nicholas Newman from the MIT Center of Oceanic Engineering, it covers all the important knowledge of Hydrodynamics, however I wouldn't recommend it for beginners.If you never studied fluid mechanics before I recommend reading the book Fluid Mechanics from White.Fluid Mechanics with Student DVD (McGraw-Hill Series in Mechanical Engineering)"
5,Prepare to subordinate all else to the reading of this book.,"The weekend was a pleasant disaster. I made only one mistake. I took ""The Price of Honor"" with me and my wife on an out-of-towner, and for once in my life, she came in second. I simply could not put it down. Col. Hackworth is the heir apparent to Tom Clancy, the mantle fitting so much better because of Hack's credibility as a warrior. Only a man who has walked on the thin edge of life and death, known the love of soldiers, and who has ultimately received from his experiences ""beauty for ashes"" could write such a tale. Captain Sandy Caine leads the ghost of his warrior father from the ignominy of official disgrace to the honor of moral victory, on the way paying a price that allowed not only the martial spirit of the Caine generations to rest, but his human spirit to be healed by the love of a woman. Once started, you won't be able to put it down."
3,NEVER WAS NEVER WILL BE,"Col Hackworth never served in Special Forces or Special Operations, he constantly hangs around them (i.e. Somilia) and quotes them as if they are best buddies. He has no business writing about SF & SOF, He was caught with an outright fabrication (Ranger Tab) by the US Army Ranger Association and than tap danced out of the area when caught. He is one of the higest decorated BN Cmdr for valor in the VN war, in fact more combat decorations than most Inf Platoon Leaders, he does that well."
3,A disappointment to a Hackworth fan,"I am an avid reader of David Hackworth's column and thought his, "" About Face"", was one of the best military diaries ever but this book is a strange one. In the beginning, it resembles, W.E.B. Griffin....in the middle, it turns into a palatable mystery......but the end! It ends like a James Bond movie, with implausible and wild situations. I gave it three stars because it was readable but still...a major disappointment"
3,Well....,"This CD is alright but its very hard for someone to acutally tell that they are a christian group. Other than that some of their songs are not bad, but still its not the kind of music I could get into. If your into heavey metal this is the CD for you, but not for me!"
1,regan is a dumbass,dude slipknot does not worship the devil or w/e u said. slipnkot is f***in awesome so shut the hell up.the only christian bands that i really like are UnderOath and Showbread and Dead Poetic
1,Die,"Slipknot, nor Demon Hunter are metal. You people are kidding yourselves. All of these christian wannabe hardcore punk bands(this isnt even hardcore punk, go listen to the Misfits guys)are giving my favorite music a bad name. If you want to listen to good metal then pick up some Metallica, Children of Bodom, Opeth, In Flames, Slayer, Shadows Fall, Darkest Hour, or Antrhax. Underoath, Demon Hunter, and bands of that like are no where near the technical proficiency that any of the above bands have. And none of these wannabe guitarists stand up to the likes of Kirk Hammett, Alexi Laiho, Jon Donais, or Kerry King. DEATH TO FALSE METAL!!"
5,Sergio Mendes & Brasil 66,Sergio Mendes & Brasil 66's hits are pretty much included in this CD. What a wonderful beat and what memories. I highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting a good selection of his early hits. I found all the ones I loved on this CD plus a couple of others that were a joy to discover.
3,Great Album>>> Love it,"This one bring me back to those days where my parents, aunts and uncles were playing it on LP. Great thing about it is I inherted their taste for great music. Althou the recording isnt as great sum of the remastered album, it still way better than playing LP."
2,Unhappy with bubble texture.,A great idea because the bubbles last longer but I was worried about my cats biting them. The consistency was a little too thick and had quite a clean up with the residue left.
1,Blades break too soon,"I purchased two of these blades. They are used only to cut very thin plastic. I was very careful in installing and adjusting the blades. I'm been around machine shops for over 40 years. I'm not new to adjusting bandsaws.The first blade lasted maybe a total of 30 minutes of cutting. The second blade didn't last 10 minutes.Other blades on the same saw have absolutely no problem. I have yet to have another blade break.As with most bandsaw blades, these blades broke at the weld. My suspicion is that the weld was not annealed properly.The blades cut very well while they last. They run very quiet and produce a smooth cut. Although we were cutting only straight cuts, I'm sure the narrow, 1/8"" blade would allow some intricate cutting."
2,Not a fan of the Big Bang Theory,My kids love these research guide books from Magic Tree House writers but this one was a disappointment. One whole chapter was devoted to the big bang theory which we personally don't believe in. They should have skipped this chapter and focused on facts.
4,Return to form,"After Regeneration came out a couple years ago, people complained that he had changed his style. If fact almost everything we loved about Divine Comedy had changed. His fans were disappointed. I was too. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't what I wanted. I heard that Neil was disappointed that his fans didn't want to follow the new direction, but he also decided to return to the tried and true sound which made him famous in the first place.This album is a return to form. He's still got it. It's got the orchestration, it's got the literary references, it's got the wit... it sounds like The Divine Comedy. It's not as good as Liberation or Casanova, but maybe he's just getting warmed up again...Anyway, there are tracks on this that are as good as anything he's ever done. The Happy Goth is definitely the best track on the album and I would say one of his best to date."
2,Fun noise when they hit something,"This is a fun toy with the exception of the difficulty of shooting it. It is difficult to get your fingers into the little pockets and hard to pull back. My children couldnt do it. But it is a cute product and does make a very loud, recognizable animal sound when it hits something."
3,It's ok except for the annoying moo sound,"I got it for my dog. I thought the moo would be funny, but it was too loud and high pitched. My dog is afraid of it."
1,Didn't work,"I opened the package, took the strip protecting the battery out and nothing happened. I assume the problem with the toy was a simple one concerning the battery, however, there is no opening to take the mechanism out, so you'd have to remove the stitching, try to figure out the problem, and stitch it back up. I knew from reading other reviews that this could happen. What I didn't expect was the horrible customer service. I notified the seller that it was broken on arrival and they sent me a form letter telling me to ship it back for a refund or replacement. The only problem was that they wanted me to pay for shipping which would have cost me as much as the toy itself. I replied that I didn't want to have to ship it back due to the cost, and asked if there was another way to work it out. I again received a form letter with the same information to ship it back. I finally got my money back after filing a grievance with Amazon. Never buying from this seller again!"
2,Broke first day!,"I bought this for my 12 year old sone to goof off with. He used it for about an hour and set it aside. When he picked it up later, he shot it once, and one front leg completely came off!What a waste of money."
4,Playmaker Toys Flingshot Flying Cow with Mooing Sound,"This is a great toy, and is very reasonably priced. All our family dogs and cats love it. It's especially great for smaller dogs, but beagles love them, too. These make great gifts to friends with pets."
3,Fun while it lasted,"Cool cow noises, freaked out the cats, one hoof came off. They fall apart fairly easily."
4,Great debut album!,"I bought this album on faith after hearing ""Papa Bear"" on the radio. I really liked the song and Keith's rich and laid-back vocals. I was really impressed by the whole album. Several of the songs struck me right away with catchy tunes and lyrics. I love the album and hope Keith Harling comes out with more."
3,Better than III,I love Walter Hawkins songs. Guess I expected to like more of the songs on this cd. Better than LA III.
2,Only used one time but...,"After dusk it made things way too dark to see anything. During the day, anything light colored looks like a ball. But having said that, I think if it was a bright day and you had just green grass and a ball, it would be easier to find. When I went there were leaves on the ground. So I guess under ideal circumstances it might help you. In other cases, you might be better off without them. Will keep trying them and see how it goes. I only used them one day so far."
4,Just a ball,It worked just like all the other balls you. You have to put the work in or you will not see the results
4,"Ball is nice, DVD takes some getting used to.","The stability ball is wonderful quality although it takes forever to get the thing pumped up. Then you have to wait 24 hours and pump it up some more. I'm thinking these things should come with a battery operated pump like an air bed. The DVD is a bit difficult. I would not say that it is for beginners, maybe intermediate. It takes some getting used to the instability of the ball, and I understand that the whole idea is to work the core while your doing the exercises, but it would be nice to work at a lower intensity when you first start out on one of these things.Overall, great product for the price."
4,Tasty!,"My baby loves barley cereal. When we got these, I was very excited. She loves them, but they break easily and became a choking hazard for her (she is 7 months old). So, we will try them again when she is a little better at chewing."
1,I agree with John Zxerce,"If you are trying to find a book which conveys the concept of 'faith' to a child, this is not it. 'Raise up a child' is heavy on feelings, but light on truth. What I mean is, consider some of the poems in the book....they emphasize feelings overfaith and ignore the importance of choosing something good to place one's faith in. Through Johnson's book, children learn to like the things they like. These are not 'lessons' which teach morals, but are poems which focus on fun/pleasure/feelings.Books with much more substance would be William J. Benett's 'Book of Virtues' or Colin Greer's 'A Call to Character : A Family Treasury of Stories, Poems, Plays, Proverbs, and Fables to Guide the Development of Values for You and Your Children' -- Both are great! Kids love the stories and you can talk about the meaning and truth...something you can't do with 'Raise up a child'."
5,Quick and safe,This is a great plug and play way to protect your electronics without havig to splice into your OEM wiring harness. Keeps you device and wiring safe from damage.
2,A Traditional and Misleading Book,"This book is an excellent choice for parents who wish to indoctrinate their children with the traditional and misleading interpretation of the First Thanksgiving. This happy-go-lucky account makes it seem as though the Pilgrims believed in religious freedom, when in fact the only religious freedom they came to protect was their own. All other interpretations of God, they believed, were false, and should be corrected. This book also marginalizes the importance of the Natives who ensured the survival of those who would eventually destroy them.This book is also an excellent choice for history teachers who wish to give examples of how children are purposefully given false impressions by adults, especially with regards to America's history. I'm buying a copy for this specific purpose."
2,Stephen Joseph Growth Chart: Transportation,Very disappointed with this item. I purchased it as a gift and the growth chart was put together backwards. It will have to be taken apart and put together in the right order. It bypasses the date for being returned which I would not receive a full refund.
2,"OK as a curio, but no more than that","Quaint old book, of interest only as a curio. It was dated the day it was published. The old-fashioned illustrations may appeal to people looking for Victoriana."
3,"Intresting, but is it reliable?","Lots of good thoughts here, and an interesting historical account of the rise of various types of governance. Unfortunately, when van Creveld talks about things I know about already, he gets a lot of them wrong -- for instance, p222, where he asserts that by 1939, 'every American' was 'issued his or her social security card', and that 'the Dept. of Health and Human Services had been created.' HHS was created in the 1970s, under Carter, and to this day not every citizen has a Soc. Sec. card.So if so many details are wrong where I know the facts, what about the places where I don't? And if the details are wrong, how good is the big picture?This book makes you think, and has a lot of good references, but I don't trust its conclusions."
5,Review of the Appointment,"This is without doubt the best book I've read this year. It portrays with brutal clarity the challenges of surviving under a corrupt and repressive Communist regime (one of the v. worst in Romania) in which no one -- not even your nearest and dearest friends or lovers can be trusted not to betray you to the authorities for the pettiest transgression from the official ""party line."" The book reflects the direct experience of the author herself who was ostracized and punished in other ways for refusing to spy on her work colleagues for the ""secret police.""The book ends with a shocking denouement that shows that in such a regime, you can only trust yourself - no one else!Author fully deserved to win the Nobel Prize. Hope she writes more soon!"
4,The Appoinment,The Appointment is a well written novel - invokes images reminsicent of Joyce and Virginia Woolf.I feel Romania with full oppression syndrome now - Herta awakens subtle fear with minute emotional description - makes you look over your shoulder while reading.I loved the book.First class.
1,So awful I could not finish,Th first book in years tht I refused to finish. It was so boring and dragged on with no progress to the story.
3,Interesting story but difficult writing style,"I tried earnestly to get through this story and while I quite enjoyed the premise, I found the style to be difficult to read. I prefer the story to happen in real-time, rather than an entire book of recollection. Given that it is free, it doesn't hurt to download it and give it a try."
1,"If you liked word over the past 10 years, do not buy","I am a software engineering major with significant experience using different products and this is one of the worst. Maybe it's because I'm used to how it used to be, but it's inexcusably non-user friendly. Do NOT upgrade to this."
4,Microsoft Word 2007,"This program has a lot to offer, ordered cheat sheets to help figure out the best way to use it. Hands on will be my school. Delivered quickly and installation was simple. Just what we needed"
3,a disappointing 2nd helping,I bought a wonderful recording of Vivaldi's opera Bajazet by Fabio Biondi about a year ago and it whetted my appetite for more so I got this opera based on all the good reviews it received. Unfortunately Orlando Furioso isn't nearly as good as Bajazet. The arias aren't as memorable and it has a LOT of recitative. Since then I've been wary of getting another opera by Vivaldi. I'd like to find one that matches Bajazet. Any reccomendations?
5,Great,It was a great and easy process at my schools bookstore I would have paid almost double. It was on great condition I would say new and it came fairly quickly about 8 to 10 days not too bad. Would definitely do business with the company anytime.
5,Great,"A very informative anthology. Contains Hume, Wilmot, Savile, Prior, A. A. Cooper, Mandeville, Addison and Steele, John Gay, Thomson, Young, Collins, Gray, Charles Churchill, C. Smart, O. Goldsmith, Chatterton, Gibbon, Cowper, Burns, E. Burke, and Crabbe. Recommended."
2,Not the best,"I took a chance on this one but it just isn't one my toddler likes. The gremlin story sounded good on paper but just is kind of weird in the movie. Also, it recycles a lot from the ""Lights, Camera, Action!"" DVD which is much better in my opinion."
4,New Architecture in Britain,"First London, and now the provinces of Britain are enthusiastically embracing blobs, high tech steel and glass structures, and abstractions of the rural vernacular-a development that would have been inconceivable a few decades ago, when the natives cordially (and understandably) detested the few scattered impositions of Brutalism. Powell has made a judicious choice of a hundred buildings completed in the last three years, or about to be.Aside from the po-mo villas of Quinlan Terry, it coheres as a portrait of the best new British architecture, with good representation of stars and emerging talents, plus guest turns by Gehry, Ando, and Libeskind. The descriptions are terse and perceptive; the illustrations of each project are few, but carefully chosen. (Michael Webb is the book reviewer for LA Architect magazine.)"
5,Wonderful Movie,I enjoyed it thoroughly! I had watched it years ago when it appeared on TV and have missed it ever since. So glad I was able to find it here.
3,Overall good book.,"Fairly easy to read and comprehensive. It could be a bit more concise, which would make it quicker to read and just as useful."
2,"Close, but no cigar....","The Second Edition of this book shouldn't have as many editing mistakes that I found within it. Generally speaking, this book does provide you with adequate information to pass 70-058 as long as you have some real world experience to go along with it; however, the layout of the book is sometimes awkward. Information is not concise nor is it presented in a fluid format. It really seems to lead you around from one place to another picking up the pieces as it goes. The major editing mistakes are on pages 425 where a TDR is confused with a TDM; 456 where a bus topology has the same exact definition as a star topology. Barely 2 stars for this one; it is a tough sell at its list price."
1,Erratic After Two Weeks,"The mouse I'd been using for years with just an occasional cleaning was becoming a little bit erratic; so, I ordered two of these for a replacement & a spare. The first new mouse worked great for about two weeks then became very erratic. Cleaning did not fix the problem. I've just installed the second new mouse and, like the first, it works great so far. If this one will keep working then I'll order another spare and figure the first was a fluke. Look for my update.UPDATE: The second one lasted one month!"
4,I love it,"I love the style and the odd rose gold color. it really grew on me. I wear it every day so the clasp has started fading and scratching. six months later, the watch has started losing time but i have read that this is a problem with all skagen watches, they eventually lose time. but its beautiful and classy."
4,copper watch,"I needed a birthday gift. I thought this a basic, but quite good looking watch that my wife would wear.I have had Skagen watches in the past and know them to be reliable time pieces."
2,Clumsy clasp,"The clasp on the watchband is unnecessarily fussy and difficult to open and close. Also, to tighten or loosen the watchband you will most likely need the aid of a jeweler."
3,NOKIA N-GAGE,FIRST I THINK N-GAGE ITS PRETTY COOOL BUT THAT PROBLEMS WENT U CHANGE THAT GAMES PLUS THEY DONT GIVE U ANY GOOD ACCESSORIES.MY SELF I HAVE NOKIA 3300 WISH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD PHONE.IT WORKS ABOUT THAT SAME AND IS CHEAP.PLUS THEY GIVE U GOOD ACCESSORIES LIKE 2 HEAD SET WISH ONE IS REGUALR AND THAT OTHER ONE IS STEREO.BUT HAVE THIS IN MINE IT DONT HAVE GAMING BUT I THINK IS THAT BEST U CAN GET.PLAYS MP3 AND ACC FILES PRETTY GOOD WELL I HAVE TO GIVE NOKIA A %100 ON 3300 AND %50 ON N-GAGE
5,Still holds ground against modern dumbphones,"I recently acquired a Sharp FX (DO NOT GET THIS PHONE) which is a very new phone at this point in time. That phone was terribly unreliable. [...]The FX would die on me constantly without warning even when it had a full battery, causing my wife and family to be concerned for my safety. After being fed up with it, I decided to stop using it. I looked around and found my N-Gage. I popped out the SIM card and put it into it.Needless to say, the N-Gage runs better in every way than the FX, even though the FX is 8 years newer than it.It may be a bit awkward, but this phone will always have a special place in my heart, and is probably the most reliable phone i have ever owned."
5,Great Book!,This book had great articles of former broadcasters and good tips. I used it for RTV classes and it was enjoyable.
3,NOT what's pictured,"I bought these specifically because the picture was of a packed set of bulbs, deep purple in color, with a silver cap. I received light purple bulbs with no cap.They are, as stated, Plasma Glow bulbs, or at least facsimiles of them.I installed them, not to gain purple light, because that's an unintelligent idea, but to gain purple color in the reflector bowl when it catches the sun.I will post pictures after work.Don't get me wrong, I'm keeping them, because they do have a bit of color in the reflector bowl, but would would much rather have the ones the seller posted"
4,Had this book for years,"I got this book over 15 years ago and use a few of the recipes faithfully. I love the recipe for the filling of the samosas (I use a different recipe for the dough). My all time favorite is the Lamb Biryani - it's a recipe the whole family loves and I use it often for special dinners. I will be making the Mullagatawny soup and the Pakora for Christmas.The only drawback is that, as another reviewer stated, there isn't a lot of variety. But it's a great place to start learning about cooking Indian food."
4,Excelente!!!!!,"Música muy especial, cargada de sintetizadores. Vannelli posee una excelente voz no hay duda de ello."
5,Yes a success for all to see,"Just got back from a trip at Olivia...someone told me about this film...rented it last night!!!This is a great movie, it is about love, and ex's and new girls and old girls and how we get together and fall apart. Temptation, love, second guessing ourselves, everything we all know now on film.It is well done, a great ensemble cast of talented girls who are really nice to look at, I just loved this film."
1,Don't be mistaken with the opening,"I saw the start of this movie on my mom's TiVo but it did not record the whole movie. I thought the opening was cute and funny. So I rushed out and rented the DVD. Boy am I glad I only rented it. The only good thing about the whole movie is that its filmed in San Diego (my home town) so I knew the areas they were in. Other then that it was all around lame. If you must see it RENT IT DO NOT PURCHASE, unless your looking for a dust collecting DVD to add to your collection."
1,Painful!,"Poor acting, poor writing, poor direction... and you can attribute it to one person... the lead actress, writer and director, Helen Lesnick, who is deluded enough to think anyone would believe two fairly attractive women would fall for her whiney self. Terrible, terrible movie. Anyone giving this more than 1 star (because there is nothing lower) obviously works for the production/video company and has some sort of vested interest in making people buy this atrocity. Michele Green is the only thing good in this movie."
4,Entertaining Film,"Low budget, but pretty entertaining. Lots of funny lines and other entertaining things. The acting is not as bad as many reviewers say. I have seen lots worse."
5,Following Jesus: Biblical Reflections on Discipleship,"I think this book is well written and Biblical. He writes about Hebrews, Colosions, Matthew, John...etc. Using themasa launching place to understand the books with insightful teachings."
1,"Network, no.","This is stranded cable not solid, therefore it doesn't work for in the wall installation. There is no mention of which type this is in the description. It works fine for patch cables though. Definitely not an installation kit."
3,Family Adventure Book,"Looked like some good ideas, but just not practical for me. I didn't do them. I gave the book away. If someone homeschools or really likes to do devotions and activities with kids at home, they probably would love it. I guess I just wasn't for me."
5,The best of the serious contenders,"My bookshelf is overflowing with Java books that I've purchased through the months. Campione's and Walrath's book is by far the best. This book contains as much beef as does Horstmann's and Cornell's Core Java series. It also has a very good blend of the human element - not just dull, dry, boring techno talk. Their light sprinkling of humor certainly helps break up the tedium.I found their discussion of the basic Java fundamentals to be the best - very clear and very accurate. Simple enough for the beginner and not insulting to the advanced. I especially appreciated their practical programming and troubleshooting tips.I'm really looking forward to their next collaborative effort."
5,This edition covers JDK 1.0 only,"This first edtion of the Java Tutorial in print covers the JDK 1.0, meaning the older event model and AWT components. I saw some editorial reviews up above that seem to gloss over this fact. Be aware that this excellent book is now outdated, and you ought to get the 2nd edition if you are new to Java programming. I just recently (June 2000) saw a print ad for a 3rd edition as well."
2,Not good if you are looking for quick info..,"As several have mentioned, this book is not for you if you want to LEARN java. It's for you if you want to brush up occasionally about what something means. You need to remember that something will be explained later and not necessarily where it occurs. This book is NOT a TUTORIAl. It's is more a reference."
2,Even Balance,"The material does contain an even balance of traditional elements with a shade of contempary. Yet, not so contempary in that it reveals an originality that does not offend the serious believer. Actually it is my thought that any gospel artist recording and creating should be mindful not to militate agains what the Scriptures teach. Perhaps this is an earnest attempt with this album."
2,Beware the knob & lever system,"While this is certainly a cushy seat, the knob & lever system on the lower sides of the seat used to tighten and loosen the shoulder straps were frustrating to use, and finally broke after only 5 months of use (conveniently for Evenflo, they only warrant the seat for 90 days). The lever would frequently stick, preventing the straps from being loosened (which could be tragic in a true emergency), and finally, it stopped working altogether, enabling the knob to be turned while neither properly tightening or loosening the shoulder straps. Seats that have the lever system on the lower front/middle are much easier to use, and have less problems. The Graco Comfortsport & Safe Step seats have this sytem, and work just fine."
5,"Orgo made easy! (well, maybe not easy, but possible)","This book is why I kept my sanity in the 2nd semester of orgo. chem. I took the class using this book the year before I transferred to a different university, and I've loaned it to some of my new friends struggling with orgo here. They've thanked me because unlike their texts, Jones' text actually explained concepts so that they made sense."
3,Too 'bubbly',"The book contains all necessary information required for students to pass exams. However the main criticism focuses on the way the material is presented. Jones takes a story-telling approach in presenting the material; there are a lot of personal experiences scattered here and there as well as the author's personal opinions about various subjects. Pictures and color seem to be used excessively, almost to the extent of overwhelming the reader. Sometimes it seems that Jones is rambling on, and it may be hard for the student to fish out the main idea. However this approach is more useful when Jones applies it to the problems and the solutions manual, as it may liven up the sometimes tedious process of problem-solving."
3,Good but has limits,"This is a nice tool but... you need to drill straight into the wall. If there is any angle it will not set the screw. In corners where the drill hits the side wall it does not work very well. If you have a seam that is not in the center of the stud, you cannot angle the screw in. If you are putting screws straight into drywall it works great."
4,A Long Term Investment in Health,"After reading about this product I decided to give it a try knowing it was as much a leap of faith as anything else as there would probably be no immediate obvious results. Its purpose is to strengthen the immune system and help promote the general health of the immune system.I started taking this product in the second week of November, 2011 and have taken one capsule a day at night with my evening meal. I cannot swear that doing this has helped me but I can say that I did not experience a winter cold this year which, in the past, I've often had around Christmas.My plan is to continue taking the entire bottle of capsules and see how I do the balance of this winter; if things continue to go as well as they have I'll probably get a refill."
3,A good introduction but not much more...,"If you are new to the brand or looking to buy a vintage Alfa Romeo this is a good place to start. Enjoyable reading but not much of a Bible. For true technical knowhow service manuals are sometimes available free from the ""Archivio Storico Alfa Romeo"" and many ciruculate on the internet in decent pdf format."
3,Not bad,"Not bad, not great but certainly not the worst. Most recipes are not that basic. They take time and ingredients that may be difficult to find, but overall pretty good."
3,Just ok,This book provides some good exersizes for kids to go over. I found a few mistakes in the solutions. Could use a little improvement there. Otherwise it is well organized.
5,Corrected edition is available,"Great for chess beginners, adult or child. If you drill on this material until you can do all the exercises quickly, you'll become a much more dangerous player and enjoy the game more. And the book is fun to use. It starts with very simple exercises and proceeds through basic tactics and checkmates.There is a revised edition available from the author's website. Errors are corrected, the diagrams are new with an up to date look, and the price is much lower than the used price for the first edition. Just google the name of the book."
5,"If you're looking to change your life, read this book!","The Teenagers' Guide to School Outside the Box is inspiring! It's perfect for any teen who is looking to do something ""different"" with their high school experiences other than choir or student council. This book full of interesting ways to ""break out of the box"" and explore the world of alternative learning experiences, and it shows you step-by-step how to get the most out of opportunities like study abroad, adventure camps, job shadowing, internships, volunteering, etc. I loved the first-person stories by teens--they made me realize that I can do something as wild and crazy as climb a mountain in Tibet or do an apprenticeship with a blacksmith, all during high school! Before reading this book, I never knew just how much is out there. Now I do. If you read this book, you too will realize that there's a whole world out there to explore!"
3,clearing headlights,lights arent bad but if you have all time running lights/parking lights there pointless.. the only time i can noticed the blue in the light is from a side view with the car off
4,Serves it's purpose,Very nice carrying case. It serves it purpose but it's a little overpriced in my opinion.
2,dumb,I purchased this because I love the actors. It was dumb and a waste of my money.Very predictable and just stupid.
2,disappointed,"purchased the movie because of the major actors, movie content was relatively clean, just was disappointed with the overall story-line. Would not think that a couple who had been married 20 years would behave as James Garner and Debbie Reynolds did. Seemed as though the script had been written by someone rather immature - just rather goofy."
5,offers a wealth of knowledge and local hawaiian lore,"Loved the ease of instruction in making sushi. Not hard to follow, well done. Also like the homespun family history. It is a great guide to not only sushi but everthing else in his style. A lot of fun."
1,This must be the worst documentary ever,"I was prepared for some nice footage from the seventies, but this is an interview from the early nineties with Perry in his home in Switzerland.The DVD comes without any subtitles and it is impossible to understand what Perry says.Also it was only 48 minutes long (not 90!) which can seem disappointing, but it was actually a relief."
2,"Good book, but would have rather had the video.",This is an awesome collection of works that definitely raised my adreneline. Bob Costas was definitely the reason I purchased the book. I only wished there was an attached video so that I could have thoroughly enjoyed reminiscing through yesteryear!!! My daughter gave it to me as a Christmas present so I can't complain!!!
5,Goosebumps,This book and accompanying cd's are simply heaven...anyone old enough to remember or young enough to still feel magic will love this. I now have 6 christmas gifts for 6 people I normally find impossible to buy for. Absolutely perfect.
3,Christmas Program,The CD is entertaining. It sounds like it was recorded from an old record. The songs are short and somewhat follow the script that is contained in the play.
3,Needs an update,"I think this is an important book for any Christian, not just evangelicals, to read. Noll shows how anti-intellectualism has undercut evangelicalism and allowed evangelicals to be ignored in the world of ideas. But not just ignored, their faith and ability to converse with the broader world is weakened by the lack of rigorous intellectual work done by those in their faith.My big issue with this book is the need for it to be updated. Many good things have happened in the intellectual development of evangelicalism since the publication of this book. Yet, other things like the resurgence of creationism, now THE bastion of currant anti-intellectualism, Ken Ham anyone? need to be addressed as well.All in all, this is an interesting and important book that really needs an update."
5,From My Mothers Record Stack,"My Mother has this album in the stack right next to the component stereo system in the living room; back then I was too young to know what she was singing about, but now I know. I pour a glass of wine and crank up the laptop...Cheers Mom!! The title cut is one of my favorite songs, I LOVE grown folks music!!!"
4,Loved this when I was a kid,"I read all the books in the series when I was a kid and I remember enjoying them. I never really thought about them after that until I saw the Titanic movie. When my mom asked me what I thought, I said ""I've read that book!"" No one believed me and of course the public library didn't have them anymore. It was driving me nuts that I couldn't remember the title or the name of the series. I finally found them! I'm going to buy a copy so I can prove that I'm not crazy. It's very similar to the movie."
5,Loved it.,I love reading about adventures of my people in not so distant dystopian future. The author's basic assumptions about the future are well grounded in the present
3,One Good Song,"Now don't get me wrong, I love this movie but listening to the soundtrack, I realized there was only one great song in the movie. Simple Mind's Don't You is the only thing worth buying on this soundtrack. The rest you may listen to once if that. Just get the one song if you can and skip the rest of this album."
1,Disappointment,I ordered this product (a cd version of The Breakfast Club soundtrack) almost 8 weeks ago. Despite e-mails to the seller I have yet to recieve my cd. I'm beginning to think I got ripped off. Thanks Amazon.
4,Don't Forget About The Soundtrack!,"Personally, I find ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" to be a great track, but it does tend to overshadow the other awesome songs in this movie. I'm so glad they released this on CD (unlike the Sixteen Candles soundtrack), because I've been wanting to get my hands on a copy of ""We Are Not Alone"", the track that plays in the library when they're all dancing."
3,Too much dog,this book was told from the 3rd person dog's point of view. I did finish reading it. Had a great story line though.
4,Good if you like Ballads,"Watch out for all the glowing reviews, especially if you are younger. I have had people who have listened to my Lamb II (the liveliest of the 3) and said, ""No thanks, a little too Jewish for me"". For the most part Lamb shines in the ballads. The words are mostly straight from scripture, so there is no wondering whether or not the interpretation is correct. At the time these albums were first released, they were one of the most progressive Christian groups, breaking new ground, but in a gentle way. I used to listen to these albums when I was younger to re-align my bearings in my troubled thoughts. All in all, a great way to have 3 albums on 2 CDs. NOTE: Jewish flavor messianic music. If you want a harder rock sound, then check out Dancing In Jerusalem or Seer. Year of Jubilee is similar to Lamb I, II, III."
5,The best Messianic music out there,"Lamb was the best Messianic band out there, and the tunes on these cd's are timesless. Joel Chernoff is a master at capturing the heart and spirit of a Jew who has found his messiah, and expressing it in music. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for great worship music."
2,Messy,"While these biscuits are organic and easy to hold, they create a mess! the baby sucks on them and then it becomes a brown mess- all over his hands, face and clothes."
