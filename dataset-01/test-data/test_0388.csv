1,We might have a defective one,"This is the worse rice cooker that we have ever used. Tried it only once. The top layer of cooked rice was soggy and the bottom half was burned. It could be a defective one since I ordered it ""like new"" from the Amazon warehouse."
1,Does not work,"The item as delivered does not match the picture, big deal. I connected it to my RFL600D amplifier and it did not work. Causes the sub to ""THUMP"" when I connect it, which also causes all the lights in my car to dim (does not happen during normal sub operation), then basically turns off the sub output. The sub output will not return unless I turn the knob down close to the minimum setting, which then causes the sub to output max volume... After I changed my pants I decided to get a refund."
1,Not Worth the money!,This was advertised as a replacement for the ebc control knob that the older style mtx amps used. Its not. Its a cheap remake and does not perform to the standards that my old mtx ebc knob did. Would not recommend to anyone.
4,A nice track,"I like ""Sincere"" a lot. This track is kind of dark, but not gritty like some 2step. It has an interesting bassline and smooth beat. The production is very smooth as well. It's not very poppy or terribly upbeat; it's more slow and almost ""sly"" in my estimation. It seems MJ Cole avoids the brand of 2step of groups like B15 Project or Shanks & Bigfoot, and that's kind of a relief. It's easy to see why MJ Cole was nominated for the 2000 Mercury Music Prize, and this offering should prove why it's a good idea to keep an eye on him and his future releases."
3,"Adequate, if difficult to control, USB notebook light","The light output of this single LED lamp is bright, but concentrated as you might expect in a relatively narrow beam. It is adequate for short-term use, which is pretty much what lamps like this are intended for.The big problem with this unit is the gooseneck. It looks strong with its metal jacket, but in fact is very difficult to work with. The gooseneck, while easy to bend, does not keep the shape you bend it into. Worse, the USB socket allows the entire assembly to wobble. The end result is a difficult to position, unstable device that is frustrating to deal with.In the end, the unit is inexpensive and, after considerable fooling around, you can get the light to shine where you want it - for a few seconds anyway. I suspect the problems I cite here are probably endemic to all of these units. Doubtful that you're going to find anything approaching perfection here.Jerry"
1,Practically useless,"As other reviewers point out, the light is very bright, but it is focused on such a tiny area of my keyboard that it is difficult to see the keys around the outside edges.But that is the least of this notebook light's problems. When I plug the light into my Mac iBook's USB port, it is impossible to get a good, solid fit, and that alone causes quite a bit of unwanted give. Adding to this problem, the arm is very flimsy and unstable. The least bit of vibration causes it to sag out of shape bit-by-bit, to the point that it is no longer aimed where it was needed - so annoying! Good luck using this thing on an airplane with any turbulence (one of the primary reasons I bought it).In my experience, this is a poorly made product that is not worth the hassle of constant adjustment. Would never purchase again!"
4,I've tried it and it works!,"Having lived in four countries now I found this book to be very helpful. It avoided the US tendency towards far too much information which shows great discipline by the authors in achieving this as the needs of the newly arrived vary tremendously, and it is a large US city.It is a handy companion size and is easily referred to giving need to know information which is a brilliant support tool in the early stages of a move. It delivered what I expected and was really the lynchpin of a successful, happy move here to Boston."
4,DVD Inserts,I have all my dvd's in a Bellagio-italia binder. The dvd refills are a great way to add more storage to my binders. The page inserts came quickly and in good condition.
5,Great quality,"These are very well-made page inserts for the Handspring dvd binders. The pages are backed in soft material to keep the dvds clean and unscratched. The image they show here may be misleading: there is space for the dvd insert from the dvd case, but if you want to save the actual dvd covers, you have to cut them down to size or store them elsewhere.If you don't want to keep the dvd covers, these are a great solution. Highly recommended!"
2,Non-standard 3 ring binder holes,"Warning. These Binder Insert Pages fit only the matching HandStands binders. The hole pattern does not fit a standard 3-ring binder. I wanted to put note pages along with the CDs, so this product will not work for that application. Also, the inside corners are tapered so that you cannot just punch 2 more holes in the right spot."
2,Does not fit the back cover of the CD.. the one that has the Track List,"This is overpriced for something that doesn't transfer my entire printed content of the CD to the booklet. Where am I supposed to put all the track information? I can fit the CD in there, but I'd like to know what's on the CD, too... and that's usually on the sheet of paper that's on the back of the CD.The liner notes fit fine.But not the other sheet.hope you understand. Does anyone know of another solution?"
4,Innovative and dreamlike,"The two reed instruments complement each other wonderfully in the tonal range of the human voice. They are smoothly blended even in stacatto pieces. Coscia reminds me of Dino Saluzzi, not as expressive, yet more rhythmically emphatic than Saluzzi and with much more variation in style. Trovesi's clarinet has a beautiful, liquid sound. The music varies from oom-pah folk to hypnotic wandering, all of it inventive. There are no cliches here. Reviewed well in Downbeat, but is it jazz? There is a classical foundation, but the rhythms, harmonies and melodies are all over the map. Even so, there is a certain sameness that sets in after a while, due to the limited pallette."
5,I Keep It In the Car,"I keep this book in the car for our travels around Pennsylvania - just in case we're near a waterfall. Directions and explanations for each fall are clear - as well as things to watch out for - private land, inaccessibility problems, etc. Great resource."
3,Beware with the sizes!,"I bought this pack to my three old years son but the helmet is some big to him and I cannot adjust it to his size. On the contrary, the pads are a little small for him.Anyway, he use them to ride his bicycle."
4,Great reveiw on Life,"Peggy O'Driscol (13) is an aventurous girl that lives in Ireland. Her older sister Eily (18) and her older brother Micheal (15) have already started their lives in Ireland but Peggy yearns for more. She decides to go to America with neighbors and leaves on a giant ship to go to America. Along with a friend Peggy met on the ship, Sarah (15), she is helped to find as a maid work at a Women's Developing School. Can she survive being split away from Sarah and her neighbors, having nothing but perilous work laying infront of her? Read the book to find out."
5,This Book Takes The Piggy's Cake!,"I read this book at least 3 times before it came up missing and still each and every sentence remains vivid in my mind. William Sleator truly has the magnificant ability to create the creative and detail the detailed. I have found that I have recommened this book to ten people minimum, and they all have spoken of it as highly as I did to them. I particularly love the part when Zena confronts Barney, saying, ""Oh, Don't blame us, we tried to stop, we tried to make you yield the Piggy before it was too late,"". She then goes on to tell him that he is now apart of this very real game. And that night when Barney played the game, and his friends became alienesque, and more such creatures began literally knocking on his door, he finds out just how real the game is. No one could capture a board game with universal scope like William Sleator. Kudos, William, Kudos."
3,Interstellar Pig,Recently our class read a book called the Interstellar Pig. Unfortunately my partner and I are not interested in mysteries or science fiction. So from the beginning we were not exactly thrilled with the book. Although we appreciate that the story was well written and had alot of substance it is just not our kind of book .Chantel and I both feel that this book would apeal more to boys because they are more interested in science ghost stories. We think that it is a good book just simply not for us.
3,"yes, its not a romance, but the Fool was robbed","I liked this series a whole lot. The Fool, not Fitz kept me reading. I think that the author knew this, that is why the titles were all about the Fool. But, the final book was all about Fitz and his resolution. Why tempt me with the possibility of Fool and Fitz getting together then having Fitz end up with Molly? I stop caring about Molly once she married Burrish. It is actually kinda icky when you think about how Burrish was like his father figure, and then got his woman, and then he got the woman back when his father figure dies. GROSS.So I am so disappointed by the ending. More Fool, Less Fitz. I thought she set us up with the homoerotic theme, then wimped out about at the end."
5,LOVE<LOVE<LOVE,"Thank you, Robin Hobb. Now, can you please write some more? I know you meant for this book to end my favorite series, but I still see little trails where Fitz could pick up...These characters are too real to me - I dreamed about them! It was VERY good, but I have been depressed all weekend to think it is over. I read it too fast -I couldn't make myself slow my reading to savor it, and now my teenager has it and won't do his homework!"
4,A well deserved rest,A truely excellent finish to a very fine series. Hobb masterfully weaves together both major an minor points from all of her previous books to deliver a satisfying conclusion.
4,Ending was disappointing,"I really liked the Fool's Errand and Golden Fool a LOT. And after reading Golden Fool, I was expecting something to happen between the Fool and Fitz. Something great and unique. But in the end, I thought Hobb didnt really give us what she hinted at so many times in the previous books. I felt duped since she poured so many hints throughout the rest of the previous books.Anyways, like many other reviewers here, I am sorely disappointed by the ending. Everything else was great except for the relationship between the Fool and Fitz. This book was supposed to wrap up the mystery. But instead, what Hobb gives us is a box of the same old chocolates. So disappointing.. but go ahead and read it. It's a good book still. Just a tad flat."
2,A note about the conclusion,"**Spoiler alert**This amazing series was flawed by its conclusion. At the end the main character (the Fool) believes the one he loves the most (Fitz) to be dead. From this the reader will come to the conclusion that the Fool will be unhappy for the rest of his very long life. Some reward for saving the world! In the epilogue Fitz explains that he is not happy with the resolution either. Why then, dear reader, should you be expected to be happy? Also, a few important things are left unresolved. What is the significance of Others Island and what are the monsters hiding in the forest there? Also what happens to the other stone dragon on Aslevjal Island, the dragon that holds captive so many forged ones' spirits? Perhaps the author should be the one to say ""I have never been wise""."
5,All loose ends are tied and Fitz remains above the fray,"I felt the Tawny Man, at least the first two books, were rather slow and, at parts, very sad.Hobb paints realistic, 3 dimensional characters who can and do die who you fall in love with, gives limits to fantastical elements, a plot that is full of intrigue, but not predictable (yet she leaves clues).Great series. If you liked George R.R. Martin's SOIF, you'll love these series."
2,Didn't work out for my running needs,"I know Danskin has been around for a long time so I expected a better quality product than what I got. I'm training for a marathon and mainly needed a legging where the seams would not come apart in the inner thigh area. When you're running long distances, as most runners know, if you have rips in that area you can get very bad chafing which is very painful. The seams in the leggings came apart in less than a month. As a result I had to adjust my stride to ease the pain, which hurt my back, feet and made running seem at least twice as hard. Since I switched to pants that don't have rips in the seams running is starting to feel normal again. I even got chafing from these leggings before the seams started to rip - something about the way it's sewn together."
5,Best leggings on the market,"I am a die-hard leggings wearer and I know these are the best there are. They are comfortable, never fall down or get baggy and they retain their dark black color. They also have a good amount of spandex, so they suck you in a little bit without being constrictive. I've been wearing them for years, and they are durable, as well. Only caveat - I wash them in the washing machine on cold, but then I hang them to dry. They will last for years and years. Highly recommended."
5,another delightful Argeneau tale,"I really loved Single White Vampire, so I adored this one. Bastien is the grumpy loveable vampire like Lucern. It's a really fun romp, but hope she does Vincent soon! And Thomas and when is Lissianne geting her book?It's a light funny read so typical of Sands style."
5,Destructive as a 3 year old with paint,"If it can be taken apart, this bar will take it apart. This is not a tool for fixing your watch. This tool is for demolition and does a damn good job of it.I had to remove two walls worth of heavy-duty floor-to-ceiling cabinets in the basement to allow for waterproofing. I figured each would take an afternoon. But not with my buddy, Max here. Each one took less than an hour. It's my new favorite tool."
2,Why didn't she research this better?,"I just read the first chapter and really could like this book. The hero is engaging, the set up is intriguing, and the younger brother's rage rings true.Then I spotted no fewer than three separate, blatant, egregious errors, one of them on the *first page*, that could have been avoided by ten minutes' research in a costume book. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, and it really makes me wonder just what else the author didn't take the time to get right.I may finish this, but really, why? If the author doesn't care enough to know that a respectable woman in this time period NEVER went out in public bareheaded...or that decoration on gowns in that time period was detachable trim...or that the heroine could not possibly tuck her earnings into her bodice *because women's clothing didn't HAVE bodices until almost two hundred years later*...then why should I care enough to finish the book?Very, very disappointing."
4,Refreshing and clear,A verry clear and refreshing book. As an NLP student I recommend this to all practitioners. This book will get you a jump start to the Master level. Thank you Ray Dodd for your deeply insightful model of awareness and change.
4,Anderson's monumental debut,"I saw this film after Boogie Nights, the film that made P.T. Anderson. My expectations were very low. I was expecting a debut-style film. However, this film was in my mind superior to Boogie Nights and even Magnolia. While those two relied on star power to promote, all Hard Eight had was four actors, one a forgettable veteran (Hall), one a chameleon-like perennial supporting player (Reilly), one an actress who was trying to live down the press of being a star's ex-girlfriend (Paltrow), and an Oscar nominee who everyone thought was a fluke (Jackson). All the players deliver brilliant performances, especially the extremely underrated John C. Reilly. A simple story with terrific plot twists and great camera work. The Vegas & Reno backdrop provide the perfect atmosphere for these seemingly lowlifes. In my mind, Anderson saved the best for first. Boogie Nights and Magnolia were good, but Hard Eight was fantastic."
1,Non-Crisp,"I have expected a Crispbread however the ""Whole Grain Rye Crispbread, Pumpkin Seeds & Oats"" is very crumbly and breaks as early as you take it out of the package and certainly when you try to spread anything on it"
3,Yummy,Couldn't eat the whole case of ryvitas but gave boxes away. Delicious and healthy with the added pumpkin seeds. Great with hummus!
5,Good for almost any meal,"I bought these crispbreads because I decided to start using good quality crackers instead of bread. When I buy bread, it tends to go unused except for a few slices. Yet, sometimes you need something to hold butter, meat, or cheese. These crackers work very well for that; they don't overpower the food and they are tasty.I did not think the crackers arrived stale. However, they do taste different than crispy, toasted crackers, if that is what you expected. I have bought Ryvita in many different supermarkets and small groceries and they always have this taste. They are thicker than what you might expect, and somewhat bland. They have taste because of the toppings that are baked into them. They are not salty, they are crispy-crunchy. They never are and I don't think they are supposed to be. They are not like saltines. They are not like Ritz crackers.They are very good, though. They have their own unique taste and texture."
4,Pragmatic and consise!,"The book offers a very pragmatic approach to the subject of system analysis and design. It also has the advantage of not being dispersive, so the reader does never loose the focus. Repetition occurs only occasionally, for concepts that may be more hostile to digest.The only thing that I reckon is missing is a support with some templates that is possible to use (e.g. a CD-ROM with examples of analysis and design).Overall, I would say is a very good deal! Definitely worth having it!"
4,Fake book has great variety but chooses the more difficult chords when they could be simpler,"This fake book is definitely a large compilation of a variety of songs but its short-coming (at least for amature guitar players) is it chooses to use chords that are more difficult than they need to be. For example: The Farmer in the Dell uses the Eflat and Bflat chords (both 4 finger chords or bar chords) when the song works just as well with G and D7 chords. However, the book does provide the fingering grids for Eflat and Bflat. Other than that, I found it to be rather comprehensive and useful. It's a keeper!"
5,Fake book of the World's favourite Songs,It's is easy to use & there are lots of songs to play.My grandaughter can use it too.She finds it easy to use.
5,PERFECT FIT,"Like the other reviewer I like the stick on type, had them on every car or truck I've ever had. one on my geo tracker now has been on there at least 10 yrs. ups had them at my door in about two days, got them off the porch and they were installed I think almost before he left the neighborhood. I like auto vent shade and amazon alot"
3,"Good book, shoddy edition",The print quality in this edition is dreadful. It looks like a third-generation Xerox copy. It's printed on low-quality paper as well.
2,"Crappy, but effective I guess",These are pretty crappy. Just spend extra $$ and get nice ones. They are difficult to install. Impossible to latch (the plastic latch is so rigid it will not bend to go over the mating slot). I ended up taping it shut with white electrical tape. They are very flimsy so do not use these in a rigorous environment. They are OK for me as I only need to prevent accidental bumps with my head. They also come with extra plastic hardware that I have no idea what it is for and it is not mentioned anywhere in the instructions.The extra plastic is in case your light bulb fixture has a collar or does not. Its on the opposite side of instruction sheet (dummy me assumed opposite side was another language of same instructions).
2,Solid medical info interlaced with painfully bad writing,"Ms. Duke is brave and honest in her account of manic depression but it's too bad her writing is so abysmal as to make the book nearly unreadable. It is saved from total disgrace by its sincerity, and the alternating chapters containing hard facts on the disorder."
4,Very easy to read - a good place to start,"This book is easy to read and a good place to start if you know nothing about Biploar / Manic-Depressive Illless, especially if you have enjoyed Patty Duke's career. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the book and the information it offers are old, and it is only a place to start. There are many other excellent reference books that you will want to keep handy. This is one to read, and then pass along to someone else. However, I recommend it."
4,Amazing!,"Patty Duke gives an amazing description of what it is like to have Bipolar Disorder. It made such a difference in my ability to understand my Bipolar family members! This is staying on my shelf, along with ""The Bipolar Child"" and ""IF YOUR CHILD IS BIPOLAR"" as my top resources!"
3,okay for price,"this book is okay & good to kill time while sitting waiting for an appointment, the characters just aren't ones you fall in love with. The ending is easily figured out about 2/3 way in."
4,The Heat of the Moon,"Well written and fast, light reading. The book was enjoyable. Will most likely read more books by Sandra Parshall. Finished."
5,Great book!,"I read the second book first by mistake, then this one, this being the first book. But didn't matter..they were both great! I just finished this one..couldn't put it down. I am ready to begin the third one and have pre-ordered the fourth one to be out in September of this year.This is such a great writer..her descriptions and words just take you there..when the phone rings you will jump since you have been so engrossed in a different time and place where the characters in the book are so real that you are a part of the scenary and action.I spoke with the author via email. She will have another out next year, 2012. I can hardly wait!"
2,the heat of the moon,The book was predictable and average. The thrill just wasn't there and so it became dull. The ending was not satisfying.
2,Interesting premise,"The story premise is really interesting, however the execution seemed less so. The shades of gray with so little black and white in story can be riviting but this just seemed a little flat."
4,Mind-boggling,"I wasn't quite sure how this book would turn out as it takes a bit to build up the suspense. As the story progresses, I found myself using a lot of exclamation points in my head about all the things that Rachel was experiencing, hypothesizing, and learning about her life and her family. I couldn't put my Kindle down as I got towards the end for wanting to know what happened. I even recapped the whole story to a friend because I felt he needed to know the story. Definitely recommend."
4,The Heat of the Moon,Read this book for my book club. Some member are looking forward to reading her next book. Enjoy the suspense.
2,Ok for the first bit but it ended up being predictable and boring,"I had high hopes for this one based on the reviews and I will say that I enjoyed the first third or so of the story. Unfortunately, at that point it became predictable and boring. I finished the book but was very disappointed in the overall story."
5,Fascinating,"After a month of commutes listening every morning and evening to Frank Muller's gunslinger rasp, I finally gave up and brought the last part of this tale into the house to listen. Roland's world is fasinating. The now drawn ""three"" are such deeply sympathetic characters that one cannot hope that they will (get better Mr. King!) live forever.The flashback that makes up much of this book is pure romantic western. For those who have read the previous books and heard reference to Cuthbert and Alaan, you must meet them. They are wonderfully drawn and great counterpoint to Roland.If you have loved this tale so far, there is nothing to disapoint here and everything to amuse and amaze."
2,Disapointing Meandering Fiasco.........,"I loved the Gunslinger. The next two books were great also, though a bit uneven......King gets a little too bogged down with the Odetta stuff. I was so psyched for Wizard and Glass, and then I found myself bored by it. This book needs some serious editing. There is an interesting, though not great, story buried in there somewhere if we can wade through and through and through....I hate to say it, but this book was actually BORING King seems like he doesn't know where to go next with this Tower series."
2,First two were amazing,"The Gunslinger and the drawing of the three are amazing. But 3 and 4 are lacking. Wizard and Glass rambles as if nothing was edited out. It loses focus and King just stops. I'm looking forward to the next one, but if its as much of a dog as this one was - I'm driving to the lot in NY and pulling the rose myself."
1,I wanted a Western and I got a romance.,"I was a huge fan of The Dark Tower until I read the Wizard and the Glass. I expected a young Roland to earn his guns and become a great gunslinger. I got a Harliquin Romance, full of flowing blond locks, and heaving bossoms.I doubt I will continue the seiries after this."
1,The Counter Didn't Go Any Lower,"I wonder from reading the comments of other readers whether we read the same book.This was an awful, awful tome. It was in dire need of a decent editor, who should have cut out AT LEAST half of the book. The disjointed plot is, of course, standard for the Dark Tower Series. The puerile prose must be read to be believed.I'm not kidding.Spare, expressive elegance is nowhere to be found. But Mr. King will be forgiven sins worse than this for producing such wonders as Shawshank Redemption, The Body, Christine and, most of all, the Shining. Mr. King can sell lots of anything now. People such as I, seeking echoes of earlier wonder, will buy. And buy. And buy.One would hope that he would have more pride.The only positive was that I bought this in the paperback UK edition, and did not have to pay the hardcover price.Stay away. Very, very far away."
5,Excellent,Not only is this the best of the series it may be one of King's best. You travel back to a small village and learn what makes Roland be Roalnd. The insight into his youthfull friendships and the events that shaped his coming of age give you an insight into the charater that King has not yet presented the reader.
5,A late start into a great thing.,"So, sadly, I have finished Wizard and Glass, skipping ahead a couple of books in the Dark Tower series. I read The Gunslinger awhile back, and wasn't all that impressed. A friend told me that the Dark Tower books were good, but I didn't fully appreciate how A*M*A*Z*I*N*G they were by the first book. Anyway, I literally was unable to stop reading Wizard and Glass, and when I wasn't reading it, I was daydreaming about reading it. This book has Tolkien influences, mythology and characters from other King books including the STAND, an all-time favorite of mine, cowboy/western themes, WIZARD OF OZ references (brilliant!) and more. Stephen King truly is one of the most creative and brilliant writers of the 21st century. His characters become lasting memories. And now, if you'll excuse me, I must go and buy every other Dark Tower book, except the Gunslinger, which I already have, and obviously, W&G. I give this book an A+."
4,"Good Book, but DT3 was really better","Well, after a long while waiting, finally there was the book and i read it at once. I really love it, but I have to say, that the story of susan was a bit to long and the story itself (the way of the ka-tet) was to short. Also I didn't like the thing with the ""wizard of Oz"". it didn't really fit in. All in all it is a good book, but the 3rd part of the series was a lot better"
4,a classic king,"Once again Stephen King makes me lose sleep.I cant seem to put the book down with its engrossing story line. This is a look back at Roland's youth, a part that I woundered about since vol three of the DarkTower series. I highly recomend this book to any Stephen King fan and to new fans I say read the first three first.."
4,it started great...,"I spent 50 bucks on this book and I can't say I am disapointed but...the start was great, classic and the idea of all of King's worlds being brought together through the tower is great but then Roland goes into his story and the whole book drags. I really couldn't feel anything for these characters of Susan and Alain and Cuthbert and even young Roland the way I could for Susanah, Eddie and Jake(and Oy). King takes about 500 pages to tell us what we could already guess at"
3,MY least favorite of the four books in the series so far...,"Hi! I've read most of SKs books and i like most of 'em and love some. Just like many people i like the Dark Tower series a lot. This entry didn't quiet do it for me. It covers the time when the Gunslinger was young [14 years?!]. If u read part 1-3 u gotta read this one ... Maybe the story wasn't told all that well, maybe i just wanted to hear more about the current affairs."
5,Fantasy may be King's new strength!,"I've read almost every book published by Stephen King over the past 3 decades. His Horror/Thrillers have become stale and predictable in recent years and don't compare to his early offerings. BUT, *WOW*, his DARK TOWER series is mesmerizing! As a Fantasy fan, I'm amazed that King has moved so easily into writing a series in this genre! My greatest disappointment is that he seems to treat this superbly crafted series as a hobby and lets many years pass between new releases. The excitement fades somewhat as a result. C'mon Steve, this is a great story... maybe you have too many pokers in the fire... start focusing on getting this series out there to completion before starting your next project! Fantasy fans will thank you!"
5,Amazing Story,This is the best book of the Dark Tower series with a lot of epic scenes. In this book the authors depicts a more sensitive and passionate story from the past of the main character Roland.A definetely must read especially for the people who have already followed the story of the gunslinger.
1,Written by the Pound Harlequin Romance,"I would give the first three Dark Tower books four stars. This one is offensively bad and to make matters worse, you're forced to read it all to keep up with the tales of the gunslinger. Right in the middle of this novel King makes you muddle through a 236 page Harlequin romance of the chaste Susan Delgado who must sell her virtue to the town mayor at the behest of her evil aunt. Give me a break and get me out of this screed! Just another 120 pages to go..."
5,I couldn't put this book down. Reading it is a must!!!!!!!!,"I absolutely loved reading this book. At almost 700 pages, it seems like it will take forever. But, you just get so engrossed in the book that you finish it rather quickly. I read this book, not realizing that it was a part of a series. Now, I'm going back and reading the first three. I'm sure they will be every bit as intriguing as The Wizard & The Glass. Enjoy the book!!!"
5,outstanding addition to the dark tower series,This story is another example of why Stephen King is the best. He can change directions with the story and still keep you very interested in the out come. A must read in the series. My third time reading the first four and I am getting ready to start on five. Cant wait for six or seven.
3,"Not bad, but ...","Honestly, when I first started this book I half-thought that he'd had some ghost writer working for him. If you're a fan of the series you're going to have to buy it, no matter what, but after the masterpiece of ""The Wastelands"" I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the writing in ""Wizard and Glass"". The characters seemed forced, the story manufactured, plot threads developed in ""Wastelands"" were chopped suddenly short in this one without much rhyme or reason.The whole bit between Roland and Susan was nice, and believable, but not really up to the King standard of his best novels. Throughout the book you got the feeling he was writing for the sake of satisfying the clamor of his fans for the next Dark Tower book and not for the sake of his own muse.Like I said, buy it, read it, but hope for better in the next one."
2,"Long... so, so long","This is a good book. I mean it. But man, this dude can't bring himself to edit. I don't often feel like King's books are too long, but that's because he usually keeps me on my toes by having a lot of stuff happen. This time, nothing happens. Then, nothing happens some more. Seriously: there's about 300 pages in here where the only part of the plot that's actually moving is King's chronicling of a teenage crush. Now, I'm all for teenage crushes, and I don't expect King to be another Stendahl or whatever, but man, they do get old if you read about them enough."
4,"Not for new readers, This is for KING fanatics.","I nearly threw down the first installment of this series of books. I look for value for money from Mr King, but here I'm not so sure that's all that evident (I've read ALL of his stuff). Still, I'm hooked, so there BETTER be a follow up to Wizard & Glass."
5,i love this whole series!,"Stephen King's dark tower series is, hands down, the best i've ever read! i couldnt put any of the books down, finished the whole 7 (actually 8) books in 2 weeks!"
3,kindle book errors,Very disappointed with this e-book. They've left out all the pictures and there's so many typos it's crazy. That's pure laziness. I've also caught omissions of whole sentences. I know this book inside and out and it is frustrating to read at times. Kindle needs to get on the ball and double check for errors better. It's not just this book either. It's also with The Wastelands.
4,Little Tikes EasyScore B-bal,This arrived easily with no troubles. Our son enjoys this set very much and he is 16months old and figured out how to play the first hour it was set up and out of the box.We haven't had it very long but it seems to be sturdy and we hope it lasts a long time.
4,Fun for the whole family,Our entire family loves this basketball hoop. It was a Father's Day gift for my husband from our children and they have enjoyed shooting hoops together. The height is easily adjustable making it a great toy for all our kids.
3,Little Tikes EasyScore Basketball Set,No net or even Instructions came with box.Talk about being annoyed.I could have even managed without the instructions but no net? Looking back at other reviews I see others had no luck getting a net shipped.Oh well looks like I can just stick a spare net on it.Hard to endorse buying this product online.Just run down to any of a hundred stores and pick it up in person.
2,What a stinker!,"What a stinker on ice! I swear, I don't care about a single one of these characters, and the plot is so meandering... it's like being lost in someone's dream. While I find dreams interesting, they generally aren't coherant enough for a 500 page novel.I enjoy a wide variety of books, and I'm usually pretty forgiving. I usually read a book of this length in a day or two, this one took me over a week. Far from being the ""book you can't put down"" this book just seemed to ramble on and on. Each new plot twist seemed like a gratuitous and poorly thought through whim on the part of the author. I really felt that Clive Barker was riding his reputation with this one, as I doubt it would have sold well at all without his name, or even if he'd been able to get it published."
5,"Excellent, magnificant, mind twisting...",This is book for anyone who wants or desires his or her imagination twisted and brought to the edge of the mind
5,Its the best!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you ever feel like you are never going to beet power stone and it feels like the computer knows moves you never saw, you should get this. It has all the moves for the people and tells other stuff.When I got Power Stone I thought I would never beet anyone. I didnt even know how to pick something up and through it. This book tells you even to do that. When you get all three power stones, theres moves you wouldn't even know existed that are fabulas.From 1-10 to see how good i was before i got this i would say a 2. But after I got this book I'd say I am a 9 and I'm still getting better!!!! I would give 7 stars out of five if I can!!!I advise you get this book, its ssssssssooooooooooo awsome"
2,A little too little a little too late,"When watching this episode, I got the impression and the pride that Sylvester McCoy and Sophie aldred were giving their all to save the show. By his third season, McCoy seems very comfortable being Doctor Who, finding his unique personality, and delivered the best performance possible giving the weak scripts to work with. This story was the direction the show should have started going in, but alas two years of ridiculous stories/scripts like ""Delta and the Bannermen"", ""The Happiness Patrol"", ""Paradise Towers"", etc. had done the damage to the ratings and loyal fans. That combined with neglect from the BBC was the death knell of the show. I take comfort that the last episode shot was a proverbial ""keeper""."
1,Home Sentinel Wireless Alarms Doesn't Last,"This is a terrible product. Don't buy it. It worked for less than a year and I couldn't find a place to get it repaired. Trust me, don't buy it."
1,Extremely unreliable bread maker,"I purchased this machine as a replacement for a Panasonic which had worn out, and I have been most disappointed in the Zo's performance. So far, every loaf has been defective. I have tried everything I can think of to improve the quality of the bread--bought new flour and yeast, [...] with the recipes, all without improving the result. The crust is very uneven, with the bottom being too thick and brown, while the top is too light. The texture of the bread is heavy and doughy. One or two loaves have been barely edible, the rest hardly so. I don't know what to do, but I am exasperated after paying such a huge price. I owned a Zojirushi several years ago and found it to be reliable and efficient, but this new model is absolutely worthless as a bread maker. The machine did receive many good reviews on Amazon.com, however, so perhaps the one I received is a lemon."
5,Fabulous Even for Gluten Free,"Since I was looking to make gluten-free bread, I was concerned how well the loaves would turn out. To my delight, everything I have made has turned out perfectly! This machine was easy to use right out of the box for a novice bread machine user. I love how the loaves are in a traditional shape. In the past, I made the mistake of ""working my way up"" to a Zo in a rice cooker. I'm glad that I jumped to the top of the pile for my bread machine. Clean up is easy as well."
4,Excellent Breadmaker,"I've had this machine for 2 months now. I was lucky to get it when Amazon lowered the price to $165.00 for a few hours. I still had to prove it was worth it to my husband, so I've been making bread in it almost daily. It really is an excellent, high quality machine. I highly recommend the book ""The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook"" by Beth Hensperger. It's the only bread machine book you will need as it has all the information you could possibly need and tons of recipes for the machine including ones for pasta dough and jam. I haven't used any of the recipes from the manual that came with the Zo, but the ones from the book have all come out great. The only reason the machine loses 1 star is because it doesn't have a ""Pause"" feature. Some of Hensperger's recipes require a pause, but since this machine doesn't have it, I can't make those. The breads I do make in this machine always come out nicely shaped and delicious."
3,Bread machine evaluation,"The machine is easy to use;however, the edges of the bread are very tough, no matter what recipe I use. In comparison to Breadman Ultimate, the Breadman machine is much better."
2,Metal shavings in the bread,"The mixing feet have scraped the paint and metal off the bottom of the baking pan. The shavings get into the bread. Customer service said that they were sorry, but the machine was past the 1 year time frame. They would gladly sell me a new pan for $60.00."
2,The machine does not brown the top of the loaf of bread.,I have only tried loaves of bread and I'm very disappointed that the top does not brown. The loaf comes out really beautiful except the top looks raw. Very unappezsing.
3,BBCCX20 Zojirushi bread maker,"I just used it 2 times, but the bottom crust gets very hard. I set it at medium.(WHY???)"
4,"Avid Breadmaker from Washington, Michigan","I usually make bread by hand, but have used other bread machines in the past. I decided to try the Zojirushi because of the reviews, etc. I have found that it does what it says it's suppose to do. The only drawback is that some of the time the dough does not distribute evenly enough in the pan before baking, so the loaf will come out lop-sided. It is easily rectified by moving the dough around a little just before the baking cycle. This is the best bread machine on the market in my opinion.I would recommend it to anyone that wants a pretty darn good loaf of bread that beats all the manufactured breads in the grocery markets. I have used my own recipes and adapted them to to this machine and they come out perfect. No need to stick to the recipes in the manual."
5,EXCELLENT PURCHASE,"I HAVE ANOTHER BREAD MAKER THAT IS SINGLE PADDLE AND ITS QUITE OLD, 15 YEARS, SO I NEVER GAVE IT A THOUGHT HOW MUCH BETTER A TWO PADDLE BREAD MAKER WOULD BE, WELL I FOUND OUT, ITS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING I EVER DID! MY HUSBAND SAID WHY NOT BUY ANOTHER, WE HAVE TWO HOMES. IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD A BREADMAKER OR ARE TRYING TO DECIDE WHICH ONE TO BUY, YOUCAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS ONE!!!THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT IT WAS THE SIZE, IT IS WIDE, SO KEEPING IT IN A CABINET TAKES LOTS OF ROOM, BUT I WOULD STILL BUY IT SHOULD I DECIDE TO GET ANOTHER.GOOD LUCK AND GOOD BAKING TO ANYONE PURCHASING THIS MACHINE."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"I loved the whole concept of this bread machine! Fuzzy logic, two mixing paddles, preheat, good recommendations...This is my third bread machine and I am distressed at how badly this machine has worked for me. I tried everything. I talked to Zojirushi and did what they said. I've made 15 2lb white bricks I wouldn't call bread. I am an electronic failure analyst in real life. I believe there is a quality control problem at the factory probably in an integrated circuit or sensor. That would explain why some people have had no troubles and a smaller percentage of us get messed up bread. My previous bread machines were dump the stuff in and get great bread. This one is hopeless."
4,Good way to start making bread!,"I used to make bread the old fashioned way every Sunday morning, but being retired has shaken up my old routine. I bought this machine and found it simple to use; so far have made about 8 loaves of various breads, all good, if frankly, not as good as plain old up-to-the-elbows in flour made bread. But good enough to beat the almost $5 a loaf ""rustic"" breads in the local market. Easy to use and clean up. Takes some practice, but that's easy. The best part is when it's done, with butter and home-made jam."
4,Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine,"I purchased the machine in March 2010 and have so far baked two loaves of basic white and one of honey oat. Overall, I am satisfied with the machine. As other reviewers have noted, at the end of the knead cycle you have to manually pat the dough so that it is even in the pan. Otherwise, you will get a very misshapen loaf of bread. If you do this, you get a great looking loaf. It seems to cook evenly and the texture is good, although the crust gets dark on the bottom and sides but the top remains light. If you live in a high altitude area, there are some high altitude adjustments listed in the Creating Your Own Yeast Breads section of the manual and there are additional tips in the Troubleshooting section. I only recently became aware of those, so I will make the adjustments and see how it affects the bread. Even without the adjustments the loaves have come out nicely."
4,I like it a lot...,"I had 2 breadman breadmakers for many years, which I loved. I finally decided to purchase the Zojirushi BBCCX20, and I really like it. It was a little adjusting, but the breads I made come out fairly consistant. The machine is sturdy and of good quality, but pretty heavy. I would recommend this machine!"
5,Fantastic,This is the best bread machine! I have had 4 over the years and this one is tops. I can't find anything to complain about yet!!
3,A Solid Bread Maker for Gluten Free Bread,"Pros:- Dual kneading blades mean the dough is well mixed- Horizontal baking tray results in a more normal looking loaf. Additionally, the holes left by the kneading blades are on the bottom of the loaf rather than the side.- Permanent storage for user cycles. I ended up creating my own for a gluten free recipe through trial and error.- It's solidly built and, aside from the con below, reliable.Cons:- I had to buy a new baking pan and kneading blades after about a year. The area around the kneading blade shafts had distorted resulting in one blade coming loose all the time. Also, the antistick coating on the blades started coming off. That said, the new set have had no such problems so I was maybe unlucky."
2,excellent bread machine,"This bread machine is heavy duty and makes a large loaf size bread. The instructions, in a few areas, are unclear and there are very few recipes. I have tried other recipes and they seem to work well."
5,Totally creative!,Have seen many videos - this one is really fun and kids will love it. The zany way Poseidon Paul presents this video is certain to appeal to children. Different from anything I have seen. Such fun!
1,"BEWARE! This was a European, not North American, DVD format!","We were unaware when we bought this what the exact meaning of ""Region 2"" meant. Thus, we were unable to play this on standard ""American"" DVD playing equipment. I believe that there should have been a better CAUTIONARY STATEMENT on the pitch for this item."
4,Great toy,"I bought this tunnel for my rabbit as a Christmas gift last year. It's a great toy (and I love the color!); unfortunately, she's not a big fan of it. She prefers her cardboard house or cat tree to hide in. Still, I like the compact design and ability to store it, and I think she secretly likes the crinkling sound.Though our little bun doesn't use, our next pet may enjoy it. Maybe even a puppy or a kitten :)"
3,"Cute, but gets very dirty.","Although my guinea pigs loved this, I had to throw it away because it was too hard to keep clean. They tend to want to hide out in it like the igloo, and use the bathroom in it, but the difference is that you can clean under the igloo."
3,Nice for small bunnies,"Great for small dwarf bunnies, but a tight fit for bigger ones. Very cute, smaller than imagined, but a fun toy for them and strongly built."
4,All Fall Down,This book held you attention from chapter one. I enjoyed reading the book. All Fall Down is concise (136 pages) but it is full of interesting twists and turns with every page.
3,Superb and Funny,"I really love it. Awesome fight scenes and of course, funny shark-chase. Nice leading lady too, looks familiar to me but nevertheless, surpasses my expectations"
3,"Great action,ok plot","if you are looking for a movie with a good plot, pass this one by, but if you are looking for an action packed film with incredible stunts, then pick up Jackie chan's first strike!"
5,95% as good as the X files,This show is great. It explores scientific ideas in a mystery/detective type of style. It reminds me of the X-Files.
5,Quirky is an understatement,"Always set the DVR to record this fasinating, addictive series filled with the original and funny characters, including a milk cow named ""Jean"". Funny and science, even pseudo (fringe) science don't usually go in the same sentence. Fringe breaks through a lot of barriers about Sci-Fi. Surprisingly appealing even to us that are not diehard fans of the traditional Sci-Fi genre."
4,Good show.,"Nice level of suspense. Not too unbelievable. Very ""X-files-ish"". I am not a fan of purchaseing dvds but if I did this would be part of the collection."
5,Great series and good bargain,"I love this show! The premise is a bit like X files but I think certainly executed better.One thing I find nice about this show is that most episodes stand on their own, yet an intricate long term plot line is woven throughout.As far as value, you get plenty of programming -- almost 24 hours of shows. I got hooked right away."
3,"Good show, bad extras","The series builds into greatness through the first season -- but the discs themselves can be criticized for not offering much in the way of extras. Only three commentary tracks exist -- and oddly, the finale is NOT one of the episodes with a commentary track. One of three commentary tracks is with a roomful of writers who cut each other off as they try to out-clever each other, and they rarely get around to discussing the show. At one point they mention that the DVD producer is yelling in their earpieces for them to get on-topic. But they never do. Embarrassing. Also the bloopers reel is misnamed, as it primarily just features actors mugging for the camera, and a couple bad line readings -- but no hilarity ensues.Maybe a bit later on they can revisit the first season with better extras. But for now, buy it and enjoy the episodes themselves."
1,Increadibly stupid and bad written.,"This show is only a bad intent to make another X-files, it has the most stupid and nonesensic plots a series has ever had, it has disgusting and unnecesary scens,... Definitely the series continue to only getting worse and worse after the first episodes. The main actress acts so bad that it's very difficult to believe that is a professional actress. In my opinion is one of the worst written shows currently on TV, seriouslt very bad written."
5,Fringe First Season,This started as a very strange series but it had me hooked as each edition came out each week I was there to see it.
2,"This movie skipped and completely shut down, so I could not warch it,","The movie would be fine if it had played right in my computer, never had this problem before with any other movie, when I complained to An amazon representative, I was promised the second movie from the first season, but never received it."
5,Fringe tv series,"I really enjoyed this show. If you like intrigue, mystery, and conspiracy type stories, you will love this series. The story line is great and each episode leaves you wanting to see the next one."
4,Fringe: The Complete First Season,"I thought I ordered a ""like new"" product (I may have been in error), but the delivered product was a bit tattered - However, the DVD quality was fine. It also arrived a couple weeks after the accompanying Second Season - however, I'm still happy and safisfied with the purchase."
2,very good sci fi,"I enjoyed the movie and the characters were good, I was able to relate to them and create a minimal bond. However, Amazon needs to work on the delivery of the movie. I noticed , for the second time , a lag/delay that was noticeable and annoying. Once they get as good as netflix and its video on demand this will be a great way to enjoy new releases."
5,Awesome,We cannot wait to watch season 2 now. We loved how the show ended with and leaves next season wide open.
5,Best show on TV,"Don't have much to say. It's a quality BD release of one of the best, most interesting and entertaining shows on television in the past couple of years. Great buy."
5,Brings Back the Best of 90s Sci-Fi,"Fringe brings back the best elements of 90's Sci-Fi shows (X-Files, various Start Treks, Babylon 5 etc.). Cool monsters of the week, an awesome story arch, and likable deep characters that you actually care about. Overall a great revival of an awesome format."
4,Intriguing,I watch an episode every day while I do my cardio. It's interesting enough to I keep me on my machine for an hour a day...that's saying something :)
2,Does this series really get any better???,"I watched the first 6 or 7 episodes. The premiere was a knockout, but it gradually slid down from there. I disagree that Anna Torv as Olivia is the show's weakest link. If anything, Torv brings dramatic weight and intelligence to her role, despite her nebulous accent. There was originally some great tension between her character and Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), but that evaporated quickly. Now Peter has the all the personality of drying paint. As for Walter Bishop, he also started out with potential, and now comes across as comic relief where none is needed. He's dangerously close to being as annoying as Dr. Smith, who turned ""Lost in Space"" into a farce. None of the characters have any life outside of their endless string of bizarre adventures. And as for the whole topic of fringe ""science"", this show is about as scientifically-based as baking chocolate chip cookies. At least I'm glad I wised-up before I spent a lotta $$$ on the boxed set."
4,Love this show!,"Loved that we could pay for a single episode, but wish we could put it on a DVD to watch without internet connection. But we cannot."
1,Irritating wireless switch,"I purchased this wireless switch and it has been a pain to own. The problem? The switch would go on and off by itself which would turn the light on and off. I am not sure what is causing it, but, I decided to purchase another brand and replace this one."
3,This item worked great for 2 years~~,"Great solution for our condo that worked great for about 2 years~ than it stopped working.Will get another one since its only $17, hopefully I will get 2 more years out of it."
3,CD is good for practice but contains errors,"I found the CD practice exams to be an effective computer based review/prep process. Nevertheless, I was extremely disappointed with the number of errors contained within their own questions. Either the Texas exam contains these same errors or this publisher needs a new editor. If they assigned a unique question ID number to each question, it would be a simple matter for readers to point out the errors. Generally disappointed with the overall quality and price. The Austin reviewer sounds like he works for the author."
5,nouveau cuisine.,"Like many 6th Doctor stories, there's an undercurrent of meanness here, which briefly afflicts even the supernaturally good-hearted Patrick Troughton as Doctor Two. Get past this plaint. ""The Two Doctors"" boasts a relentlessly inventive script, serving Sontarans, cannibals, genetic engineers, fishing expeditions and captured moths together in a semiotic feast. And the Androgums -- feral, passionate, haughty -- are one of writer Robert Holmes's most stirring inventions. If you're curious about the Colin Baker era, the Troughton in this might make Baker's abrasiveness go down a little easier. I think it's worth it in any case. (Sorry about the eating jokes.)"
2,Far too long.,"I must admit, The Two Doctors was dissapointing. At three forty-five minute episodes long, it is at times boring. The plot is exausted at this length. Patrick Troughton makes a welcome return appearance, as does Frazer Hines. The location filming in Spain is nice but does little for the plot. The Sontarans are introduced far too early in the story (and why they've all grown beards is a mystery). Also, it is nearly impossible to forgive the Doctor for murdering Shockeye (unless pushing Cyonide in his face was an accident). On the whole, a painfully confusing but watchable story. END"

Deciding to go to a known dr. friend of his Colin heads for the planet Camera only to find death anddestruction.

Lots of DVD x-tra's
2,rakvision,"I have not bought this product, but from the price range given here, it seems that this product will not fully convert the color systems when recording of the signal is engaged.This device was meant for playing video games with american ntsc color system on pal tv.This device will work with dvd players also.If you need to convert ntsc to pal or pal to ntsc for recording purpose, then buy something else."
1,Didn't Work,I bought the Emerson EVC 1500 to convert a US DVD NTSC sigal to a PAL signal for a UK television. The converter did nothing to the signal. Picture remained B/W. Don't buy this...A.
3,more taper than I really needed,"I got this rolling pin to replace my old cylindrical pin, which had wobbly handles. I figured a pin that was made of a single piece of wood would be sturdier and easier to control.In practice tho, the steep taper makes it much more sensitive and more difficult to control, so it's actually harder to get an even thickness. The small diameter (less than 2 inches) doesn't help either. Maybe if you're working with very hard and difficult to shape dough this would be a good pin to use, but then I'd probably want something heavier.Overall it's a functional but awkward pin."
3,"OK, but too light","This is bigger than I thought when it arrived. It could stand to be a little smoother, but it has nice flexibility in the shape. I wish it were a little heaver as applying pressure is not as easy as with a standard rolling pin. Still nice though"
3,takes some getting used to,this is beautifully made but takes some getting used to. Have only used it a couple of times but it feels good - i am sure that with practice it will perform better!
3,"Sleek and functional, could stand to have better quality control","I've always found rolling pins to be a pain in the neck to use (and clean!), but it took me a while to finally get around to ordering a French rolling pin. I like the feel and balance of this one, and it works well for rolling things nimbly. The manufacture was not as careful as I would have expected given the rhetoric, though-- the wood near one end is uneven and a little ragged, I had to sand it down a bit to keep from getting splinters. (I could perhaps have returned it for a new one, but decided that it was a small enough blemish, away from the part that rolls food, so I can just cope now that I've removed the most serious dangers...) Basically, my feelings fit into six words: it's a dowel, it works fine."
2,No Paperwork,Product arrived Ok but I recieved no paperwork with it.I would have likeda booklet with instructions on rolling dough with this style of rollingpin.
1,"Too short, too thin, and tapered too sharply","I ordered this without knowing the dimensions, which were not given in the description. The Vic Frith French Rolling pin was smooth and well made, but too short, too thin, and the taper began right at the middle, so that the center section was not flat, which made it difficult to roll pastry evenly. I measured the Frith dimensions as 20 inches long by 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and then ordered a larger model made by Fantes, 20 1/2 by 1 3/4 diameter, which worked much better."
3,bigger than I wanted,"I have used this rolling pin a few times making pizza crust and tortillas. It did seem to work better than my straight pin as far as making circles. That said, it seems HUGE and bulky. The size is not as listed for sure because mine is 19in long (not 22in as stated) and 3in thick almost (in the center) and the taper is soooo gradual that it is practically flat. And there is no way to call it ""light weight"" as other reviewers have. The customer pictures I see posted really don't look like what I received. Initially I just thought ""wow I must have been wrong"" but now I think I will contact the seller and ask what happened. Just beware, if you were going for a truly tapered and light weight rolling pin, you might end up getting what I got."
5,Great French rolling pin,I seen this rolling pin at amazon thought I would give it a try and I love it. Its very easy to roll dough it's easy to handle
5,Great help for healing!,"This book gives wonderful simple cures for many health problems. They are especially good because they may be purchased inexpensively, mostly from the grocery store, not the costly drugs. They are natural cures, with no side effects as the drugs have. I will use it often for reference, and will give many books for gifts."
1,Bad scholarship,"This is what the review in the Hindu-Christian Studies Bulletin, vol 10, 1997 had to say about the book: ``There are inaccuracies of one sort or another on a majority of the book's pages. Kripal's hypotheses are based upon innuendo, prejudicial translation, and cultural misjudgments.'' I concur."
2,Poor scholarship,"As I have commented in response to another review this is a poor effort on a number of counts but most specifically in terms of the author's inability to distinguish between a hypothesis and fact.I'll leave the accuracy of translation from mid 19th century colloquial Bengali both in terms of language and culture to others more knowledgeable, but for the author to present suppositions about childhood sexual abuse as hypothesis and to lack the honesty to temper the conclusions based on these suppositions with the acknowledgement that he presents no facts to support his case is simply poor scholarship.Oh dear.P.S. Just imagine what would have happend if he had undertaken a similar analysis of Muhammed or Jesus... How well would the ""its just an academic point of view - didn't mean to be insulting"" argument have gone down then?:)"

3,Justly reprinted,"I have not seen this edition, but both the component novels, ""The weapon makers"" and ""The weapon shops of Isher"" are old friends. These are among the better of van Vogt's works, perhaps not the absolute best, but close. For books written some fifty years ago still remarkably readable. Justly reprinted.Note that ""The weapon makers"" was written first but that ""The weapon shops of Isher"", added later, is a prequel. The stories are also different in tone: ""The makers"" is highly dynamic (almost dynamite), while the ""The shops"" is much quieter."
4,The Girl With The Fishbowl Eyes,Recently got back from holiday in Hawaii & bought this CD as we heard them on the radio whilst out there cruising in the hire car. The tunes are really happy and have that Hawaiian feel to them. We particularly like the album because it reminds us of our holiday. If you like SKA then you will like this album.
3,They Work,"Soon I'll be moving across country with very limited luggage space and I need something that will allow me the most bang for my buck. These bags do work, but you have to get used to how to use them properly. Its very important to follow the directions precisely. It is possible to flatten the bag out after you've rolled the air out, without loosing the seal--but you should be careful. I'm going to try the regular Space Bags as well to see which model is better. These do work, but they require patience (it might take a while to roll all the air out) and practice to get it just right."
1,Travel space saver bags,I did not like these bags but found that Samsonite space saver travel bags work much better. They last a very long time (have the same set for over 10 years now). I get the air out by placing them on a hard surface and lying down on them. Works much better than rolling them up to remove the air.
4,A good read for Orpheus fans,"I enjoyed all four of the stories in this book. Some of the things in it did seem to go against certain things in the core rulebook, however. Still, the stories are great, and I strongly recommend it."
3,Bonito reloj pero muy pequeño,"Este reloj me gustaba mucho, y al momento de pedirlo me fije en el tamaño de 39mm, tengo otros relojes de ese mismo tamaño y me parecio muy bien, pero al momento que lo saque de la caja me decepcione al ver lo pequeño que era, fue una mala compra pero ni modo."
5,Swiss Army Watch,Second watch of this model. First watch 18 years old and still runs. Very pleased with the accuracy of time keeping. Will recommend to anyone interested.
1,NO CD,"this is the second book in a row from amazon I received book but no cd, very dissappointed with this purchase."
4,big help,"The CD tracks are a big help. The TAB portion was written by Arthur Rotfeld. As usual with TAB written by persons other than the player, I have found a few discrepancies, but over-all, an excellent addition to my learning/teaching library."
3,Beautiful yet somehow unimportant,"Eno has captured my attention and imagination with a number of his diverse works. I never expect to find the same thing from him yet, with this particular departure, I never felt that it was a musical work but, rather, a series of bell studies. The title indicates this, so I wasn't surprised.Listening to the CD, found myself distracted by the slightest thing yet, when my attention was focused, the material is wonderfully beautiful. I think my biggest reason for purchasing this frighteningly expensive disc is that the proceeds go to support the Clock of the Long Now foundation. Their efforts are, in my humble estimation, very important.If you're new to Eno, this is not the place to start. If you're an avid fan, you might feel compelled to have this disc in your collection. For me, in the context of his other works, this felt, somehow, unimportant."
4,Mind blowing,"At once haunting and pleasant. Invigorating and comtemplative, the ideas behind the pieces are thick with math and logic, and some are trimmed with humor. A great undertaking of music and science and time."
3,"Nice coffee table book, but...","...it does not always provide pictures to clarify the sometimes confusing directions. I have been crocheting for about a month, and based on the reviews, this seemed to be an ideal book for me. It is true that the pictures are beautiful, and the illustrations of the basic stitches are very helpful (assuming you are right-handed). However, most of the variations are NOT illustrated.It does have some very interesting projects, and provides some idea fodder that I certainly never imagined.So, if you have some experience crocheting, or if you have a mentor who can help clarify instructions, this is a worthwhile addition to your craft library."
3,Wilbur and Mr. Ed were never like this.,"Peter Shaffer's weird stage play makes for an even more oddball affair as a film. Most casual fans of director Sidney Lumet (""Network"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""Prince Of The City"") probably won't believe that he made this one until they watch the credits themselves. Richard Burton heads the all-British cast as a psychiatrist probing the mind of a stableboy (Peter Firth) who has committed an almost unspeakable act of animal cruelty in a bizarre fit of psycho-sexual pique. As you may have guessed already, a good portion of the film takes place in the doctor's office, with the requisite ""flashbacks"" telling us the story behind the patient's mental meltdown. Burton's rich, cathedral voice, Firth's twitchy performance and a fair amount of unabashed sexuality (fans of Jenny Agutter will definitely want this one for thier, uh, collection...) should keep most viewers from drifting off, but the film is probably too static and ""stagey"" for today's typical attention spans."
3,Loses in film translation,"Having recently seen the London production with Daniel Radcliffe and Richard Griffiths, Equus is best left alone with its minimilist stage and representative 'horses' instead of live animals. Richard Burton, however, always a favorite of mine is intriguing to watch, and listen to with his famous voice and delivery, and I would have loved to have seen him do this production live. This film served as a good background for more modern productions, but is a pale substitute for a live performance."
5,Latex/Rubber-free mouse pad,"Finally found a mouse pad that does not contain Latex/Natural Rubber. I have a life-threatening allergy to Latex/Natural Rubber and love this mouse pad. It's Monet ""painting"" makes it beautiful as well."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this product to remove some light scratches caused by a towel. I followed the directions and applied this product twice to a small area of my front hoood. There was absolutely no improvement. I have to wonder if these great reviews were added by someone who works for a company that would benefit from a good review. Don't waste your money on this product!
2,Didn't work too well for my car,Someone keyed my car so I have been trying to find something that would fix it. Nu finish didn't work!
1,Complete useless,"I didn't expect too much from this product. I didn't think it would remove deep cuts. but to my amazement. I found the product to be completely useless. It couldn't even remove some of the whitish, very shallow scratches. I don't know who rated it 5 stars, Maybe those are from the manufacturers themselves. But I can tell you for sure it DOESN'T WORK! Don't waste your money."
1,Nu results,"Nu Finish didn't work very well--definitely not like their commercials, will not use this product again. Buyer beware, you're better off with another brand."
1,Lost time,"This critical review is useless. It could be probably 60 minutes long only including the material that is worth it. What are those empty comments by Mostly Autumn? It hurts my intellect, give me a break."
5,another great season!,i enjoyed watching every season of this very funny show! brings back good memories from long ago!! wish there had been more seasons!
5,The Road Hammers,This was a great CD.. Every once in a while I like to go back for a little country and western..This took me back home.. All because I seen the video on Utube.. Just great..
1,misleading,"THIS IS JUST THE HOOD. Was not what was pictured or advertised. Close to 30 dollars for just the hood, wish it wasn't so dificult to return items. They even went as far as telling me it was shipping in seperate packages. Complete rip off DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR!!ScoopFree Automatic Litter Box Privacy Hood"
4,This should be standard,This should be standard on the product. I wished it wasn't purple. Maybe it'd be better if it was more ventilated on top as well. It came scuffed up and an ugly sticker on it that's hard to remove.
5,Good buy for CD recorders,"If any of you own a CD recorder for a stereo like the Philips ones, this CD is perfect to use. I currently use these CD's to record with my Philips recorder and they work very well in my car, my portable and other CD players. There is an occasional skip but otherwise these CD's work great!"
5,Daniel Craig's Big Debut,"Again, the BBC is asleep at the wheel! Now that Daniel Craig is such a big star, don't you think that others just might be interested in seeing this great role for him? Hello!The Ice House is a superior mystery, with great interactions between intricate characters. Yes, I was kept guessing through the whole story. Great British acting. Let's get this released on DVD, PLEASE!"
5,Ice House,An interesting early movie of Daniel Craig's...not your usual stuffy British fare..would recommend for Craig fansof his early movie career
3,"Gone, but not forgotten!","This modem worked great for us with Win XP, however - after uninstalling this modem and going on to DSL, the darn MODEM ON HOLD UTILITY won't leave me alone. I don't remember ever asking the install to load this. It did, though, and now it won't go away! I would love to know how to uninstall this! I did not ever use it in the first place. It comes up in my system tray over and over and I have to close it down every time I restart my computer and I can't even find it in my system! I HATE programs like this that hide from me and I have no control over them... especially when they are useless! Grrr..."
5,A classic,"This DVD is bound to wind up a classic in the paddling world. Whether you enjoy whitewater or a quick stroll across the lake, you will appreciate the skills these folks have with a paddle. Ocean surf is very unpredictable, and these folks make it look easy- enjoy!"
5,"Norman, no...Gloria, yes!","I gave this dog to my niece, Madeline, for Christmas, along with a hardcover version of ""Grumpy Gloria."" She loved it. She even gave it to her grandfather in order for him to make the ""Grumpy Gloria"" sounds (and to stop his terrible singing!). The plush is super soft and is totally cuddly! Overall, it is a great product!"
4,Expensive. But...,"Well, if you need to use it, you just have to pay the price and don't look back. It is a little expensive (or at least for us given the huge quantities of coffee we squeeze through our E8 machine), but for 4 years now we have had zero problems with our machine. So I assume that it is doing it's job honorably."
3,Confusing advertisement of product,"I purchased this product because of the ""(Pack of 12)"" as listed. Obviously I expected to receive a 12 pack. I actually received only one box of No. 1, 40 count. I now have no idea what the ""Pack of 12"" referred to. The single pack that I received was excellent quality."
3,Didn't work for me,"I have the Black and Decker Brew and Go and found the #2 filter works best, but cut down a inch. I bought a ten pack of these #1's and found that when the coffee was brewed the filter folded over and coffee grounds tended to spill over the sides of the filter and found coffee grounds at bottom of mug. With the #2 filters, the filter sits a little taller, hugs the sides of the plastic, and I didn't have this problem. Tried to even wet filter before brewing hoping it would hug sides of plastic better. Should have bought one pack at the store to try first.In a different coffee maker they might work great, but not the Black and Decker Brew and Go."
3,more vacancies,would appreciate some more informtion regarding jobs for Indians in cruise. Any information from the user would be greatly appreciated for a job seeker in cruise.
4,"a careful, thoughtful approach to theology through models of love","Love can be a very soft and vague topic, lending itself more to flights of poetic fancy than to careful analysis. In this book, various Christian theological visions are explicated in terms of the particular model they offer of love. This is a book that is clear, serious, intelligent, and insightful. It is hard to imagine this particular project being done better."
1,Seller trying to deceive customer,"I ordered this product from the seller because the image showed 2 filters. So any one would assume that he was selling 2 filters, else why will there be 2 filters in the image. When I opened the box I had only 1 filter. The one I received was in great condition but where is the 2nd one!!?"
3,"It is 1-pack, not 2-pack","This is an OK filter for the price. I usually use the plumbers white rubber sealant tape, the one that is used to make hose connections tighter. I wrap up the place where filter connects to the vacuum. It resolves the problem of being not tight.It comes in 1-pack, not 2-pack as it is on the picture!"
4,Works Fine,I bought this as a replacement. I received it pretty quickly. My only reason for indicating 4 stars instead of 5 is that the picture shows 2 filters and you only receive one.
5,Great disc,"Anyone who has used other radiology CD's will recognize the excellent quality of the images on this CD. They are great.And author M.M. selected great cases, too: Mostly classic cases plus unique presentations of common diseases. A must for anyone who wants to see lots of cases, especially when preparing for boards.One weakness: limited (if any) differentials are provided. But this weakness doesn't change my opinion that this is a great disc."
3,Disappointed. Not worth the money.,"I'm in my first year of practice, and bought the CD as a reference. I'm disappointed about the resolution of the images. They should at least have been XGA resolution. A radiologist should know how important the image details are. Maybe it would have required two CDs to fit all of the images at a higher resolution, but it should have been done to meet a minimum standard of image detail and information. I think my money could have been much better invested in a different reference. If another edition is published, I recommend higher resolution at a lower price."
5,My sister is THAT KIND OF WOMAN !,"that lets her husband beat her, order her around and humilliate her in front of stragers!I hate that ! And I have beaten my ""brother "" in law twice!Useless! Because Anita, my sister, even got mad at me...He had beaten her so badly that she had two broken ribs!WE MUST PUSH OUR WOMEN TO LEARN SELF RESPECT AND DIGNITY...AND THIS IS THE BOOK !It is not a book on agression, but on DIGNITY"
3,problematic product,I received it in the time promised and great condition. Product over time did not perform as advertised and i changed to a wired system from wireless. Seller was great.
4,Won't work with Windows 98SE,"The requirements say that it will work with Windows 98SE. I tried two different computers with windows 98SE and it didn't work with either one. I spoke with the tech support and they didn't know anything about it not working with 98. They were no help. I tried it on ME and 2000Pro and it worked perfectly. Very easy to install on anything other than 98. As long as it is not on 98, it works great and I am really happy with it. The range has been great, at about 30 feet through 4 walls I get full power. Comes with a long usb to be able to place it where ever is best. Worth the money."
3,Average book but it helped me pass,"I read this book from start to finish and found one or more topics completing lacking. One such area was authentication - in particular Kerberos. In the test, I was asked about Kerberos and had absolutelty no idea what to answer. I went back to the book after the exam but there was only one paragraph about Kerberos. Admittedly, my practice exams were also light on Kerberos.Apart from that there were some minor typos, but the writing style, in my opinion, was a little more livelier than some other texts.I certainly wouldn't rely solely on any one text to pass (this book is no different). Get a practice test software as a supplement.In the end, I did pass and now the book is used as a reference for which it is quite adequate."
2,Mistitled,"""Basic Forms Without Explanation"" should have been the title of this not very instructional DVD. The picture quality was fine. The sound quality was acceptable. The action, while lifeless, was cleanly done and cleary shown. Sadly, the audio commentary, which could have added so much richness, depth and instructional value to this sterile piece was almost silent. With all that silence, I had plenty of time to watch the instructor and think, ""That sword must be at least two sizes too big for her,"" and wonder why her eyes never focused on anything. This DVD was clearly more about some internal type of meditation than sword fighting. Unless you are studying the specific forms covered by the program and have a real live person to work with, I'd recommend you pass on this one."
4,Quiet you,"Ok, so let's move beyond the reviewer who felt the need to look up every artist with ""cotton"" in their name. I get the feeling his opinion should be overlooked. And completely. This is a great release, though nowhere near as strong as their later work. Songs such as Keepsakes and While I was sleeping hint at the direction they were about to head in, but the rest is some very strong late 90's emo. Pick it up if you're a fan of the genre."
4,Excellent,"Many many classic Bugs cartoons. Not one a dud. (Although, Forward March Hare does get a little heavy handed with the patriotism. Anything to keep Joe McCarthy from breathing down their necks I guess.)"
1,Doesn't work with XP,"My fiance bought me this last xmas from R. Envelope and he paid $100 for it!It won't work with XP and they would not accept it back.It also requires an additional memory card.Smart Idea this digicasette, but it was not followed through with. I wish i got the chance to use it."
4,good things but expensive !,i got it from my friend. it is small and its voice is beautiful . i think it is a good mp3 player. the more important is that it can be used in a cassette player. but it is more expensive than any other 32M mp3 plays and only Parallel cable be used. i hope usb interface be supported.
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I read night spider, and enjoyed it. When I saw this book, I thought ""hey, that one was entertaining"" and most authors I read tend to be pretty consistent. This book was awful. It was boring. I think it took me about a month or more to finish it, and I usually read books in a few days tops. The things the other reviewer said are all true -- why not change the locks? Isnt it weird they're all having decorators? I am now going to start writing down the authors of books this boring, so that i don't buy anything by them again. I actually threw this book in the trash, because I didn't want to torture anyone else with it."
4,"Pretty Good Album, Just Not Their Best","Petra was coming off the sensational ""Beyond Belief"", an album that had moved them back to the forefront of Christian rock; this album seemed to be a bit less ambitious but was still filled with quality songs. Petra's ability to weave new and unique songs about faith were in clear evidence here. My personal favorites are the mature ""I Need To Hear From You"" and the quirky, dance rock styled ""Dance"", a song with a message of faith that doesn't sound unlike The Killers. While its predecessor and ""Praise 2"" are better places to look for a first impression of Petra, you wouldn't go wrong by giving this album a thorough listen."
3,Unseen Power,A good cd. Has the usual Petra radio friendly songs. The rock songs are better than most of their songs on Beyond Belief. Could do without the radio frindly songs. Never did like any of Petra's ballads. Highlights are Unseen Power and Dance. Would be a better album if there wasn't so much keyboards.
3,decent,"It was nice to find a book dedicated to Ultralight spin fishing, but I wasnt real impressed with the authors advice/knowledge. I dont doubt that he can go out and find the fish, but it certainly didnt sound like he knew enough to be authoring a book about it."
3,was this ewing oil?,"Worth 3,5 stars, but I gave 3. This is cowboys, ranches and poor ladys. It has some interesting scenes, but somehow lacked a passion. The brothers were good, they had nice relationship. I liked the way everybody else knew right away when something had happened between hero and heroine(..our relatrionship is a worst-kept-secret in this ranch...). I didn't like the villain and had sometimes a feeling of seeing this before in the old westerns (or Dallas). Cowboy lovers dream... all the others find a more modern book. But definitely worth buying the brothers stories as well."
4,Okay,"Although I liked this book well enough, and I enjoyed the fact that the author also gave practical information for overcoming life's obstacles, the spells seemed a bit stale and she didn't really offer much for personalisation. The spells are all focused on business and helping your self-esteem, which can be very helpful in day-to-day life. Recommended."
4,Its a great read and better than a real campaign!,"Being an experienced political junkie and a Ward boss I looked to this book to be something less than realistic or exciting and I could not have been more wrong. The book flows like a real campaign with plenty of twists,turns, and surprises just like the real campaigns. For the novice or the expert you will find things you didn't know about politics, political relationships and the real world of elections and winning. One can only hope that Mr. Walker gets ""FOUR MORE YEARS!"""
5,Fun for Muppet fans!!,"This game is so enjoyable!! There are races, challenge courses, and 'stunts'!! It's extremely challenging if you can't figure out their little ""secrets"" ;-) I would highly recommend this game if you feel like laughing while exercising your playstation skills. Also, not only do you get to hear Kermit say, ""Ha ha!"", but you get to hear the Swedish Chef proclaim, ""Shmork!!"""
3,Hard,"This game is hard. The people are hard to control and there's so many corners to go through that I just keep bumping into walls. If you're a muppet fan this game is really cool. All the tracks are from the movies Muppet Movie all the way up to Muppets From Space. The graphics, scenery and clips were soo good that I just played the game, came in last every time, just to look at them. Rent before you buy so that you know what you're dealing with."
4,Denny Lane CD,"My husband liked the Denny Lane CD, he brought it to Beatfest last Sat. and Sun so that he could sign it. Thank you.M Scola"
4,This shampoo works!!!,"I was hesitant to order this shampoo but I was really at my wit's end amd I am happy I did. I would have given it 5 stars but as effective as it is, it is just wayyyyy too strong. It stripped my hair of digital perm (expensive!!!) :-(. Overall, recommended because of its effectiveness but sure hope they come up with a milder version."
3,works average for the past year comparison to wax products,It's been over a year's experience that I have had with this product. This is the first time I tried it. I see no difference in the length of time it lasts on my car and truck vs other good quality waxes. I'll use the rest of the container on my truck and car again but will not buy more product. The traditional waxes costs less. I gave a 3 star for average but will not buy again
2,a dissapointment for gorillaz fans,"i love the gorillaz, but this cd was a big dissapointment. they really need some new material, the whole cd is just re-mixes of their songs which have already been mixed into multiple versions. i admit that there were a few good tracks, and none of them were horrible, but it can never compare to their other albums."
3,Gorillaz in strugle,I think that the gorrilaz shouldn`t of put this cd out cause it has only remixs of 12 songs.I mean sure it ok but I think they need to get know song.Remixs or cool but not cool ah noof I mean They have like 10 verisons of 19/2000 and 3 Versions of Clint eastwood.That is why I rate this a 3 star Cd.
4,Gorillaz Dubbed out? What could be better,"When I first heard of this cd I was a little suspicious. It was before I even knew what Dub was and from the briefs clips I had heard I was confused as to what had happened to my favorite Gorillaz tracks. Returning a few years later with a little more knowledge for what Dub was I immeditaly became fascinated with this cd. So I bought it, and let me tell you I was not dissapointed. Anyone who is a Gorillaz fan and either enjoys dub, reggae or any mixture of trip-hop or ambient should give this disc a listen. You won't be dissapointed"
5,"Beautiful, heart-wrenching...","This is not my fav Sherryl Jordan book (that will forever be The Juniper Game), but Secret Sacrament runs a very close second. The ending made me cry, and for days afterward I'd be picking the book up and reading random passages again, it was that good. I read the UK version, published by Simon and Schuster in 2003, (it has the most amazing cover) and apparently this is a changed version of the original published in 1996. Anyway, Sherryl wrote an preface to this version saying that ""the scene in this book of Myron's death, what he and Gabriel experienced in the Valley of the Shadow, is taken almost word for word from my diary (after her mother died)."" Interesting stuff."
4,"mess with the bull,you get the horn.","early 80's movie about a group of guys trying to clean up the neighborhood,and they do a good job of it.i love 80's movies so this is another to add to the collection.never seen it on dish."
1,sigh,"sigh............i cant add anything more intelligent than the others so ill just say this, buy everything before this album and never know what has become of wumpscut, ull save yourself alot of disappointment."
2,Not the same stuff I used to use,"This product seems to cause more stomach irritation,than its suppose to be relieving.I took one capsule and it hurt my stomach.I may try it one more time ,but the first time was so unpleasant thatI was reluctant to try it again.This product was missing from my rite aid shelves and than I found it on Amazon.I am unsure if Schiff changed its ingrediants or what,but I purchased three boxes at one time,and I dont think I'll be able tofinish them."
5,Works,"I had to take it for several months before it started working consistently, but now I am very pleased with its effectiveness."
2,trolley hardware,I have purchased this type of trolley shown in the ad. The trolley itself that is shown does not last long with an active dog.
4,Can You Believe This!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the first Henry Miller book I have read. It is truly for the open minded. It nearly blew me away and kept me up all night reading it. Some may view Miller as a pornographic pedler, but, I view him as a pathfinder for free speech and freedom of expression. I am ashamed that America has banned works by him and other artists because they deem them inappropriate for the time. I still liked the book and plan on reading more of his work in the future. So, if you would like to take a sordid ride into the psyche of a ""player"" read this book, it will provoke you and make you think."
1,Sloppy,"If the spelling errors and switched illustrations are any indication, the recipes are likely not worth it. I was looking at the recipe for Wiener Schnitzel trying to figure out where the rolling depicted in the illustration figured in the recipe. Might be an ok book if you know German cooking and just need measurements etc. Another hilarious example: a recipe titled ""Kuchen"". Which one do you mean? ;-)"
1,Get a George Foreman Instead,"I wish I bought a George Foreman instead.This grill makes meat grey and rubbery. I think it is because it does not get hot enough.I tried it several times with beef, pork and chicken, but I'm giving up, it's going in the trash - I like my meat grilled not steamed."
4,so fun to play with!,"the dancing alligator is awesome! of course, it works best on hardwood or tile floors (not carpet) so keep that in mind. its definitely a source of entertainment and exercise for kids of all ages!"
1,Sabbath? Not taught by Jesus,"A solid look into the historical record of the Church proclaiming Sunday as the primary day of worship.More citations would be helpful for further investigation, but I grant the argument put forth that the Church did ""change"" to a Sunday worship day.From Scripture though, there are NO New Testament teachings for Christians to be held to 7th day Sabbath. In fact, all of the 10 Commandments are repeated in the New Testament at least 4 times, except the 4th Cammandment (Sabbath). If Christians are to keep a Sabbath, Jesus nor his disciples ever taught to do so.Christians are NOT under the Sabbath Law under the New Covenent. Christians are to worship everyday. Romans 14, tells Christians not to argue about such things, as it brings separation among them."
2,Does not work with CDA-9847,"This does not work with the CDA-9847, and i am really bummed out about that i was hoping it was an easy fix so i can use my IPOD.Oh well."
1,extra pulling power,"I bought this thinking it would keep my dog from pulling, because people have told me it was the only way they could control their dog. Even though it didn't make sense, I thought I would give it a try. This would be great if you want your dog to pull you on skates or something. It gave the dogs a tremendous amount of pulling power. Harnesses are for sled dogs. It was shipped quickly and was as described."
4,CLEP,"I found the practice exercises in this book to be very helpful, and I did really well when I took the CLEP afterwards."
1,Poor under every aspect,"Poorly designed, and poor in ideas. This book describes techiniques that are, at least, childish (what about to go out your home with a pair of phonebooks wrapped on your belly to protect yourself from a stiletto's blade?). In other cases are totally useless. It's a pity, 'cause sicilian (and most south-Italy) culture has a real heritage of stiletto's fighting techniques very effective. The author should try again to expose his knowledge in abetter way."
1,Predictable and waste of time.,The main kid should go to acting school; instead ofstanding around and acting stupid. Girl was ok. Only ifyou are drunk and have NOTHING to do.
1,NOT IMPRESSED.....BOOK CONTAINS NOTHING USEFUL.....,"Nothing in this book was of any use to me. This book offers absolutely nothing that a girl can use for applying make-up, removal of make-up, or coordinating colors. No "" How to advise"", no real ""Beauty secrets"" or ""Tips"".If anyone wants to read a GREAT and INFORMATIVE beauty book, read ""Face forward"". It's written by a real genius, with hundreds of useful tips and advise for make-up application, choosing colors, and finding the perfect style for you. The author of this book has done many celebrity make-overs and knows what he's talking about.Another great book for teenage girls is "" Bobby Browns, Teenage Beauty"". This book offers practical advise on make-up, skin care and styles and it's geared towards teenagers.As for this book, I guess it's ok if that's all you have to read, but if you have a choice, buy something more useful....."
3,So-so item and so-so shipping,The first clock sent was defective and I had to get a replacement. The second one worked but its not easy to read the numbers in dim light. The numerals are large but without brighter lighting in the room its all too dim to read. Also the shipping from this seller was poor; the item was rattling around in a box with no padding...but the first clock was a manufacturing defect in the clock itself. They sent a replacement with no questions asked and it came promptly but the first clock was very slow to arrive.
3,An O.K. read,"This book was a quick and OK read. I really liked the story and the writing, however the hero left me wanting at times. I understand he was complex and hurting over this deceased wife but his treatment of the heroine was just horrifying at times and bordered on emotional abuse. He treated her like a 2nd class citizen and his change of heart happened so quickly it gave me whiplash."
2,Not worth it.,"I read the book in a California history class and learned nothing from it. The book is nothing but a tirade against California agriculture, industry, and culture. Her views are totally bias, and she focuses on isolated events in California's history. It's no worth the read. If you don't like California, you may like this book."
5,Amazing quality for the price,"I agree with other reviewers that this could be an L lens! It is crisp, clean, clear, and has amazing bokeh. I use this as a portrait lens and couldn't be happier. The colors are amazing and I am constantly surprised by the quality of this lens. Definitely a great piece to have in your lens collection."
5,Beautiful,"I am pretty new at the whole Photography art, but this lens is simply beautiful. It gets color, light and focus near perfectly. Best lens I have by far."
1,Who reviews these items??!?!,I always use cheaper trash bags but these are the cheapest. Every time the top straps end up ripping off the bag. The smell is non-existent. After old food and dirty items spread all over your floor for the 3rd time in a week - you realize you can't even use the bags you've bought. Don't buy these. Pay the extra money for something that does what a trash bag is suppose to do - hold in the trash.
3,"Sometimes difficult to understand, and the binding falls apart","This book is okay for a student that is going to be guided through it step by step, but to use as a reference text I think their are probably better books out there. Harmening can get a little confusing on this topic at times, though I have heard that the 5th edition is a bit better. Also, the binding fell apart. I wrote the publisher and they said they would replace the book but only if i sent my old one in. I didn't want to loose all my notes/highliting so I am just going to deal with having the book fall apart."
5,A pioneering piece of Islam,"When I first read the first part of the title of this book I had some doubts about why it is ""Mohammed's Allah"" but soon after completed reading it, I understood that the title is completely appropriate for the content of the book.Because in the book the most important concepts such as the the difference between the terms ""God"" and ""Allah"", functions of the brain and its importance in Religion,fate ,and very interesting explanations about death,dreams and illusions,system of life and so on... are very clearly and scientifically explained from the prophet Mohammed's perspective.This book is absolutely a pioneering piece of Islam. Meanwhile, if you want to reinforce your knowledge and comprehension about Islam more, you should read Hulusi's the other book ""Islam"" as well."
2,Dated and Missing information,"This is a decent guide for quick information, but I would not recommend it to those who are looking for a comprehensive guide. It is missing quite a few species, and has outdated information related to certain fishes."
1,incorrect information,"Picking up this book in a bargain bookstore is something I ordinarily would not do becauseI,ost my son on 9/11 and don't ever look at those books. When I looked at the first few pages, they seemed thoughtful, interspersed with lines of poetry and descriptions of individual personalities. However, when I got to the page where my son was listed, I almost felldown. He was listed with 3 or 4 other names, alkl women. Under that was the sub title, Physical Descriptions. After that followed what could be called a medical examiner's review of the people as they were found at recovery. It was digusting- not only inappropriate, but in the case of my son, totally wrong. I am so upset, that I am seeking legal counsel."
3,Great for Some Things,"I've owned this crockpot for about 9 years now and we loved it so much that when we dropped the porcelain pot we went out and bought the exact same thing. This crockpot is wonderful (5 STARS) if you just want to cook a roast or something that needs to (or can) cook for a long time. I recently started to become more versatile with recipes and wanted to try some new things and use it more often to have dinner ready when I come home, but it burned a recipe and now I'm shopping for one that will automatically switch to warm after a certain time setting. Anything I cook will cook for 10 hours and not all recipes can cook that long, even on low."
5,Lots of Fun Activities for Your Child,"This is a very good toy. It is bright and colorful. It combines a lot of great activities into one toy, which is good because you don't have to get tons of toys at once and have them all over the house. This has a toy telephone, and even though it isn't all that fancy, my kids love to pretend to talk on it. There is music with animal sounds, a fun shape sorter, a clock, gears, and a basic jack-in-the-box-like toy with a cute bear. My kids have lots of fun with this toy and it has helped teach my 4-year-old to tell time. Some people have reviewed this and said it was too loud, but I really don't think so. You have to let your kids have noisy toys sometimes because it's part of being a kid."
5,Iphone wall charger,"It is a good priduct for what it does-that is, it charges the phone quickly and efficiently"
5,Absolutely beautiful! A must buy!,"I'm not from India or any of the surrounding countries, but I bought this for a friend from Kerala upon the arrival of her first baby. I wanted to get her something truly unique that would remind her of growing up back home. Although I don't know any of the words, I can truly say that this is a beautiful album! Absolutely beautiful! I play it for my own kids!"
1,Worst vacuum ever made,"I wont even give this piece of junk 1 star, but had to to right this review. Had it serviced already once, worked great for a day. Wow, all this for 239.00 at CC. There should be a class action lawsuit to give the owners of this piece of junk something. I will never buy another Hoover product again. How in God's name could you give this 5 stars. Did you use the product?"
1,Pure junk,"The U8351-900 is the biggest mistake you can make when buying a vaccuum cleaner. The Hepa Filter is a joke. We use our Red Devil to clean the filter. Now the on-off switch has failed. The suction in the hose is next to nothing. The front exhaust blows the dirt in front of the machine. And, it's the heaviest vaccuum we have ever bought.We kept our Windtunnel but now it failed.HOOVER, KEEP YOUR JUNK!!!!!!!!"
1,Hoover wind tunnel 2 U8-361-950,"This vaccuum suck, hepa filter clogs does not turn, would not reccommend it to anyone for the price it SUCKS."
2,Poor quality parts,This vacuum cleans well but the quality of the materials used are suspect. The plastic on the body of the machine broke where the bottomplate screws into. This is my fifth Hoover and it is the only one that is so poorly made. I still have two older Hoover that I use cleaning downstairs and the garage. One is over 15 years old. Of course all of this happened right after warranty and Hoover was sympathetic but was no help. No wife says she will no longer buy a Hoover since they evidently do not stand behind their products. The vacuum has incredible suction but the the beater path does sometimes clog and it is difficult to clean out. The accessories are easy to use but I wish that the handle was compatible with their older hose extensions.
5,"ANOTHER GREAT, BLOODY, BRUTAL, GORY TALE FROM SIN CITY",So far this is one of my favorite sin city books. The story starts off at Dwights girlfriend Shellie's house. Jackie Boy (who is Shellie's previous lover) is outside her door and wont leave her alone and insists he comes in. So he comes in drunk with some friends. Dwight is at her house and is waiting for Jack in the bathroom. Jack hits Shellie and Dwight roughs him up a little bit and scares them off. Jack and his friends drive off to old town with Dwight following them. The girls of old town then gruesomely kill jack and his friends. They then find out something about jack that makes them wish they never killed him. From then on it turns into a bloodbath of revenge and murder as Dwight and the girls do there best to keep all of sin city from crashing down on them. This is a very well written and illustrated story. But keep the young kids away.
4,work in progress,I think that this is a good book with some excellent ideas-i am in the process of using the metaphysical ideas and currently have no feedback-it has some excellent business and advertising ideas that I have tried and they really do work!
5,Finally!!!,"Finally!! Thank goodness somebody wrote a book on the difference between true worship and going to sit in a building each Sunday to see and be seen. Sadly, most churches today, indeed have become ""lukewarm.""God bless you, Bro. McCranie for having the courage to speak up!"
3,Well...,"the reason i bought this item was because i broke the taillight on my four wheeler and i had gotten an Amazon gift card so instead of spending money on a cover i just bought this. what you see in the picture is what you get. It is 3 lights in plastic covers on a strip of metal. I had to run a ground wire from the inside since it grounded threw its mounts (i was mounting it with zip ties) and sealed the lights with hot glue (its on a four wheeler and if the light goes under water what happens when you take hot glass and get it cold really fast, it cracks or explodes) i also spray painted mine black for a better look. I have only used my fourwheeler a few times since i put the lights on but so far they work and look really nice."
3,Does the job but could use some work,"A couple of issues with this pot:-The spout doesn't pour well. We have cheaper coffee machines (one a $10 job we got for travel to relatives who don't drink coffee) that pour much better - no dripping down the sides, etc.-The handle works loose on a regular basis and need a screwdriver handy to tighten it.We love our Bunn machine but have been disappointed in the decanters (this is our second one)."
2,This is not exactly a SLOW cooker,"I thought this monster slow cooker would work well with my large family. I have used crockpots for years. Well the problem here is that it cooks too fast. The high setting is like medium high on the stove. The low setting is like almost medium high on the stove. I put five pounds of chicken in at 4 and by 8 I had very done chicken. I put a stew in on low when I left for work. Eight hours later....things were so done that I had mush. Yes I filled it up past the halfway point. Veggies get done without an isssue in this appliance.I use this slowcooker now like an extra pot off the stove. On high, it will bubble and boil. I use it to put tomorrow's dinner in at five thirty in the evening. By nine that same night, I have a meal for tomorrow. I am just glad I did not give away my old crockpot. Sometimes you need the food to cook SLOWLY. This should be named the Spacious Extra Pot that can cook tons of food quickly. There is nothing slow about this appliance."
1,TERRIBLE MOUNTING KIT,"I bought this for my 2006 Ford Five Hundred (Amazon says it fits my vehicle). The instructions showed parts that didn't come with it, and didn't show what to do with the parts that it DID come with. The instructions for different types of vehicles were about 1-2 sentence long that were not useful at all. I finally got it installed, just to notice that it isn't flush with the trim. DO NOT BUY THIS."
2,I wouldn't waste my money on this,I read a lot and i put this book down pretty quickly. Not because it read fast but because it seemed a waste of my time. This book didn't engage me some of the scenarios seem out of touch and conclude with overly simplistic resolutions.
4,What European Movies Do Best,"Tragedy without fake plot twists. Everybody in this movie loses something important and in some way anticipates just how difficult the future may be. Even the adulterous couple will have a huge shift in roles when the panic has calmed, confusion has turned to understanding, and the urgent need to be consoled has been satisfied. They all act very much as real people would that ""okay, now this decision has been made, there isn't really any way to undo what has been done."""
1,The wireless range is shorter than any wired mouse...,"This ""wireless"" mouse has a range of roughly 6 inches, meaning that I have to keep the mouse within a shorter range of the USB port than I would if it had a wire. In addition, its tracking is sporadic, even on the recommended surfaces. Don't even consider this mouse."
2,battery hungry and confused,I have used this model for about 6 months. And it will bankrupt me replacing batteries. It also gets confused if I try to use both the laptop touch pad and then switch back to the mouse. My logitech model V220 unit on another PC is flawless and operates on it's original battery forever.Get the V220
1,Not as pictured,"The product shown is not the product I received. I'd had a 72214 for several years. When it wore out I wanted to replace it. The mouse I received looked similar, but was NOT a four button programable mouse like the original (pictured above)."
2,Doesn't Last Long,"This mini mouse worked fine - but only for a while.I liked the fact that it ""went to sleep"" after some time, as a way to save battery life. However, It was a bit awkward to get it working again afterwards, since I always had to look up which button(s) to press.I'm giving this two stars, though, because it *died* after less than a year of use. At one point, it just stopped working. I replaced the battery, but that didn't solve the problem. I tried resetting the mouse following the instructions, but that didn't solve the problem, either.Basically, the mouse stopped transmitting, and it was unusable from then on. To me, this was a waste of money."
1,Only works when plugged directly into the computer,"Kensington's tech support folks tell me that *no* Kensington wireless products will work when connected to USB hubs or to any other device other than directly into a USB port on your computer. I think they should make this clearer on the specs, but they don't; I'm returning mine because I bought it to use w/ a USB port on my keyboard, which is plugged into my laptop's only USB port... and it doesn't work when plugged into this configuration.On the other hand, the mouse is cute as a button and very comfortable in the hand. If you're going to use it plugged directly into a port on your machine, it's a fine mini-mouse. It is a bit of a hassle to have to use a pen or safety clip to press the button on the bottom, as noted by the other reviewer."
1,I don't understand what they see in this book.,"I recently found myself making a blank book to fit a leather cover after searching everywhere to find an unlined book that was of the proper dimensions. This is the book I turned to for inspiration and instructions. Only to be sadly disappointed. Most of projects in here were interesting but the ""how to"" parts of the book were confusing and vague to the point of absurdity and the pictures only made things worse. As a veteran crafter and owner of well over a hundred craft books and a person perfectly capable of programming a VCR or assembling IKEA furniture even when the instructions have been lost. I don't think the fault is with me especially since I had several other people try to decipher the instructions for these projects with no success. I was not happy with this book and if I could do it over again I would never have bought it. There are many fine books on bookbinding but in my opinion this is not one of them. Thank You"
4,Great!,I loved this game. It is super fun and just difficult enough to be challenging but not so bad that you are frustrated and stuck. The dino's are wicked fun and unnerving. I love Regina she is awesome. Thumbs up!! ^_^
3,Cute,"A very silly book. It is enjoyable, very light reading. The puns are thick, heavy, and non-stop."
1,Not satisfied with sizing,I ordered size 3 little kids and i received a siz 3 big kids. I live all the way in the caribbean so it is difficult fr me to try and return this product. I now have the task to trying to get it sold. So Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012PIPO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
2,Is lacking in some areas,"This shoe is narrow across the toes, and definitely needs a better arch support. I'm truly disappointed with this shoe, but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe."
1,Black and Decker TCM 700,"I got this coffee pot for Christmas. I was excited because I loved the thermal pot and the timer. I now hate it. It started off by turning off automatically after the coffee was half brewed. I lived with it, and just hit the button again. Now it turns off after about 30 seconds. I have to turn it back on about 6 times to finish a pot of coffee. I might as well squeeze the beans under hot water."
1,Forgive me Ms. Borchardt,"Night of the Wolf was probably the worst novel I have read in many years, and I read more than 50 per year. After reading the other reviews perhaps it would have helped to have read some of her other wolf books first, but I doubt it. Her story line was full of inconsistancies - almost as if she had forgotten what she had just written, her descriptive prose was awkward, repetitive and oh so boring, and her characters could have been interchangeable cardboard cutouts. I tried to give up on reading this book roughly every 50 pages or so, but I haven't given up on a book in over a decade so I guess you could say it was a matter of principal that I perservered and kept reading. Besides, it had to get better, right? Wrong. I sincerely regret wasting my time. There are too many marvelous new and old authors to ever try this author again, so consider yourself warned. I wish I had been."
1,And another thing....,The author keeps referring to Dryas as an Amazon. But then when Dryas refers to her people she speaks of women and men living together in some sort of harmony. The Amazons of Myth never cohabitated in harmony with men...the Amazons used them as breeders to populate the female race then they tossed the men aside or used them as slaves--as well as any male offspring.
2,A disappointment and a waste of my money,"After buying the first book, The Silver Wolf, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. The Silver Wolf sucked me in immeditately and I was never able to put it down. This book, however....First off, the transitions are clumsily written, making you feel confused almost all the way to the end. Not only that, the plot moved like a snail. From the portrayal of Maeniel in the first book he seemed interesting and a character of depth and honor. As I read on in the sequel, however, I felt as if he was nothing after all but an animal. He has not even half the depth of Regeane's character from the first novel.I think that maybe this book was rushed or something. I hope she puts a lot more effort (and better character development) into any upcoming sequels. This book was a severe disapointment to me and I know (using The Silver Wolf as an example) that she can do much better."
3,Nice tool but difficult to install,"This device is quite useful, convenient, excellent space saver.It is however very difficult to install because the bolts in the back are almost impossible to set and tie up. In addition the distance of the preset holes is greater than the regular studs distance, I had to drill new holes. You need a lot of patience and wrences of various types because of the angles and tight spaces.In sumamry it is sturdy but the design is lacking. Just few more holes and a greter distance between the back bars would help a lot.Calphalon could do much better with very little effort.The rating is reflecting the installation: no stars!I hated it during the installation, now afterwards I like it."
2,Hard to put together,Parts didn't match up; mounting holes (anchor holes) should've been larger due to the size of the anchor needed for the weight that the pot rack itself holds (without any pots and pans).
1,bigger isn't always better,"I bought this to replace my 15 year old toaster oven that turned itself on one day and tried to burn my house down. I loved it at first. Good sized and good features. Then within a few weeks the dial broke and we can no longer change the temperature, it is stuck somewhere in the 400's. Then last week, it wasn't on, hadn't been used that day, but I had forgotten and left it plugged in, and as I was cooking dinner the thing flashed. Needless to say I am shopping for another one."
1,difficult to use,"This came with no directions and when I tried to fill it with melted chocolate and cool it and then tried to get it out, it was stuck-came out broken and I would not recommend getting this if you are new to trying this type of candy mold"
1,Not the best book on this subject,"Too much information on what the symptoms are and how it affects our lives. I already know that because I have been living with this for almost 6 years. So I then bought ""Natural Therapies for Mitral Valve Prolapse"" and got the information I wanted. It is a small booklet that gets right to the point on exactly what to do and the suggestions are working, so far."
3,Same stuff,"Book is similar to other books on MVP-looks like authors got ideas from other MVP books. I didn't learn anything new. Not a bad book, but nothing new about MVPS is in this book. If you've gotten the other books, and most of us with MVP get everything, you've already gotten the information. Somewhat disappointed. Thought a new book would have new information-not so."
4,Kick @ss Rock and Roll!,"Good album to bang your head to. Good crunchy guitars and driving rhythms. If your seeking intelectual fodder, skip this but if you just want to rock out, this is the band to do it."
1,Good Concept Cheap materials,"This is a good concept. It does make bulky items like blankets and comforters more compact for storage for the winter. However 2 of the 4 bags we bought didn't hold a vacuum. The plastic is thin and easily tears. Look for some products for storage once the patent is up and a few companies can make competing products. As for Space Bag, this product is a cheaply made loser. I won't waste my time and money on it again."
1,Don't bother,"Great idea, but the bags are cheaply made and often just won't seal. Wasted money and lots of frustration."
1,they leak,"the concept is GREAT!! they work easily and great... for only about 10 minutes... came back and the compressed stack of 5 bags all had leaked air, only one has stayed compressed. examined the ziplock seal - which is cheap, and doesnt work well - and physically sealed the zipper with my fingers to ensure they were shut. tried again each of the leaked air bags... worked perfectly... again, for only 10 or so minutes. the stupid bags leak somewhere in the seal. i use a vacuum packing sealer in the kitchen for food and they work. this stuff doesn't work, as evidenced by the ratings and posters on this board... save your money."
1,crazy album,"does people just prefer cheesy and corny songs like these, come on have a life, she can't sing at alL!"
1,oh pls!,"come on people, r u all deaf, this album is really the worst ! she can't sing at all, i must agree that she do sounds better in french, but not much better with her kindda voice, not a worthy buy at all!"
5,Looks great - great with pendant lights,"We have pendant lights that hang 42 ish inches apart over our big kitchen island, which made it tough for me to find a ceiling pot rack that would work...so I put it off. This one is perfect (the lights drop down within the ends of rack), and once you find your ceiling joists with a stud funder (important!) it's easy to install. We're very happy. It's actually pretty light (key since our pots are heavy.)"
4,Great Poacher,"Had to experiment at first to get the waterlevel just right for my poached egg liking.Also you are limited on egg size.Do notexceed large eggs,or you will have a mess.After mastering the operation,it is a greategg poacher.I haven't tried hard boiled yet."
3,"Peel it from the shell or the tray, your pick.","I bought this item to make poached eggs for a quick breakfast. This way I don't have to take the time out to peel them, but cleaning the poacher tray cancels out that bit of saved time. The egg sticks to the tray much worse than it does to it's own shell even if you grease it first. Also, the tray sometimes gets stuck in the lid and it isn't easy to get it out. I like my eggs hard, but so far they haven't cooked all the way hard with the recommended amount of water. I will be using it more as I go along and may write another review after I get it fine tuned, but so far these are the issues that have come up."
5,great egg cooker,"This egg cooker does an excellent job, especially for hard boiled eggs (just don't overfill the water reservoir). It is simple to use and easy to clean. When using the small insert pan for poached eggs, I would advise using a small amount of spray, butter, or margarine to coat the surface (even though it is a non-stick surface) - the poached egg just slides very easily from the pan and the pan is easier to clean. The first cooker I bought lasted over 20 years and I used it often. Other friends have bought this cooker, from my recommendation, and they also love it."
5,Easy to Use,"My elderly father has been using this egg cooker for over a year. It works really well, is easy to use, and lets him make his breakfast on his own. His eggs are always cooked the same amount, and the egg cooker turns off on its own. We've experienced 2 problems: once someone got water inside the motor while washing it, but we didn't know until the water caused a short that kept the cooker from turning off when it was used. Another time something got accidentally pushed against the front button although there wasn't any water in the cooker. In both cases, the cooker got so hot that the plastic top melted. I highly recommend this egg cooker -- just be sure to unplug it when it's not in use and don't get water inside."
2,Great for awhile and then POOF!,"I loved this cooker. It was great until the last time I used it and it was just as some others said. The plastic lid melted and I'm still trying to get the stench out of the house. Apparently, it didn't turn off when it was supposed to. Glad I was at home so the house didn't burn down or something! Am so disappointed because I really liked it!"
1,"Sorry, not so good ....","We have had two of these units in the last three months, and each of them failed by not shutting off properly and melting/fusing the plastic dome to the base. Oster replaced the first one, and now we are moving on to a different brand (with a stainless steel cover) after the second failure. In between meltdowns, the unit worked great and it was a nice kitchen convenience."
5,Really Terrific and Reliable Egg Cooker,"This egg cooker is the old reliable Sunbeam (made by Oster, which is Sunbeam) and I am so extremely happy with it that I bought another one for my sister. It cooks just as well as always, no screw-ups, and is easy to use and clean. Also, it turns itself off when the signal goes, so you will not have to worry about a hot appliance cooking away if you didn't hear the ""click"" when the eggs are done. I had another egg cooker so badly designed that you had to actually unplug the unit to turn it off...this one is therefore much safer. Highly recommended."
5,Works great!,"This product is very easy to use and works great! I had tried a different egg cooker and found it to be hard to use. However, this one has turned out to be fantastic. I recommend it to anyone wanting an easy way to boil eggs."
1,Beautifully shot with no story,"The person who wrote the description of this movie, that is on the case and also is what enticed me purchase this, must have read the book. Because none of the plot described in print is contained in the movie. The move has long sequences of silent stares into the camera, some gore, and some (oh I am glad the kids are not in the room sequences). Sadly the movie is so bad I am not even enticed to see if the book actually contains plot. This is my first wrong movie purchase of the year."
2,Not for me,"This is not a lens for anyone shooting events indoors.It MAY be great for those of you who don't mind using flash, but I really try not to (preference here). So, others like it and keep in mind the type of photography you do and take it for a test drive - returned."
4,Just Starting...predicting I will love it!!,"Eric hasn't written back yet that I didn't enjoy. I just began reading ""Liar's Game."" Though I had it for a while...job, classes, and other life things...prevented me from getting started on it. Plus, I was finishing up on some other books I had started prior to this one. Now I am ready. I feel that from the data I've read already...I am sure and confident I will love it through to the end. Let's see...Monica"
2,Oops!,"I've read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's previous books and this one disappointed me. The storyline was weak and I was left wondering about some of the characters (Claudio, Gerri). Everyone is entitled to make a mistake and this is one of them. I will continue to support this writer and I've even encouraged some friends to buy the book because they might enjoy it. I'm not one of the readers who was enthuiastic about this book."
3,Enjoyable,"This book contains a lot of humor. It is entertaining, and has very good love scenes. However, I thought the ending could have been better. But overall, it is enjoyable."
5,"Like fine wine, savour the quality of Liar's Game","EJD, You go Boy ! Lair's Game was simply a page turner. The research that you put into your books is really in depth, readers can truly identify with the characters, been there, done that, know someone who's been there and done that, wrote the postcard. Liar's Game arrive first thing in the morning at work, I tried not to look at it, but it kept calling to me, read the first page, can't got deadlines, it kept calling, I am so weak, read the first chapter, worked late, Dana and Vince are so true to what takes place in some relationships. I truly enjoyed every word, but I knew I would."
2,Not that good,"I was a big fan of Eric Jerome Dickey and I have read all of his books, but is it just me or all of his books starting to sound alike? It seems like they are all out in L.A. and that there is always a man with his heart broken. He is a very good writer but I was not feeling this book. Reminded me of all of the other ones with that tierd, hurt, black man plot."
2,Just plain awful,I felt compelled to write after just finishing Mr. Dickeys book. I have now read all of them and I can tell you this one is just plain awful. What was up with the licking of the gum? Why did we need to know this? He seemed stressed for ideas and good story line in this book. It seemed he just threw in some weird stuff like the gum licking and the female lead always having to pee for lack of any real substance to write about. We are sooooo tired of wacked out female characters. I would not recommend this book especially if you really liked his other stuff. You will be highly disapointed.
3,"""A Good Read""","I enjoyed this book and I look forward to his next book. This was a sort of a new twist from the Eric Jerome Dickey ""norm"". I felt that the main male character sold his self out a bit by letting his baby's mother have too much control for too long. He should have nip that situation a couple of chapters ago. It took his woman to force this drama to a halt and he could have done this himself. He could have been much stronger. I truly enjoyed this book overall. Keep up the good work, Eric.Rhonda Gibson, Founder, First Annual African American Book Clubs & Readers Retreat 2000, Oct 13 -15, 2000, Cherry Hill Hilton, Cherry Hill, New Jersey"
3,not anything like i expected...........................,"ok people we all know that eric is the man when it comes to writing, and his books are always fast pace. well this one was a no go! i read it and was not happy at all. i will say though that vince was the man, granted he did not come clean in the begining but dana was a hater anyways. the relationship with vince and harmonica was pretty cool too, but there is not much more i can say about this one. eric is still the man, but this one is a thumbs down! dana's character was so young and childish, her character did nothing for me. cheaters was my favorite and i'm still lokking forward to the next one!!"
3,Not My Favorite EJD Story!,"I am a huge fan of Eric Jerome Dickey, however, this novel was my least favorite. It was a title for my book club's February selection and the majority of the members were truly disappointed with the novel. Only one member truly loved the book. The writing wasn't the biggest problem. The character development was weak at best, usually reading EJD's main characters you feel some empathy for them. I found it hard to like Vince or Dana. The message of the book is truly an inspired one and makes the book worth reading yet you must get past the slow beginning. The story really gets interesting near the end if you can wait that long.Every story cannot be great or perfect. This less than perfect story will not discourage me from reading future works of Eric Jerome Dickey."
4,"Interesting, but not what I expected",I guess I just have high expections for Eric Dickey. It was a good book but not what I expected. The two main characters didn't grab me. I mean it had some predictable turns which I'm not used to from this author. I was anticipated this book so much I ordered it from the the internet before it even came out.I mean I liked it but just not from him.
1,Disappointed,"EJD is one of if not the most talented author I know. As soon as his books hit the stands - I'm there! (it's on my calendar months in advance).But I have to say that this book was not his best work. The story line was slow, neverending and boring. It was a very slow read. The only way I could finally finish it was to take with me on a 6 hour plane ride! EJD you are still the best - but this one was not your best.Disappointed in Queens, New York"
5,One of the best,"War from the foxhole perspective. Excellent. You cantell watching this film that ww2 was fresh in the mindsof its creators, not some long ago sentamentalized heroicevent. Modern film makers like speilberg should watch thisfilm and learn. The citizen soldier at its best. no heroics,not a lot of action, but a lot of story and very well told.skip all the new flashy ww2 movies and go straight to this one.Don't expect John Wayne though, this is gritty, real, drama."
1,"Was is a game, irony","If you see this movie in perspective, it was filmed in 1949, right after the war, and the US were coming our of their biggest conflict ever. Hollywood had the responsibility to rebuild a positive sense in life, and war movies like this had the purpose of portraying war a nasty ugly thing were irony and American positive values could still dominate. Today we are used to realism and this movie clearly belongs to another time in history.The story itself is supposedly centered around the battle of Bastogne, but in reality the battle and its struggles are exposed with limited details. What is extensively depicted is the life of the American soldier at the front. This would make a movie interesting, but again this movie cooks the story with too much irony, positive values, and American idealism that in my opinion becomes boring and ridiculous."
5,We just don't make it like this one...,"I gave 'Patton' five stars and I give this one five too boot. But movies like 'Patton' deserve Ten stars and this one should be given seven. That's why I couldn't give it four stars since the scale in way too off.Great story and great cast. Them hollyweird types dolled up this tale with one of the weaker episodes out of 'Band of Brothers' and this one still stands mountains above it without the emo-rific nature from hanks' take.I don't watch WWII movies for the body parts a flying, I watch it for the characters acted! Boy do those guys act circles around the weeds sprouting out these days."
4,Nifty machine but a bit difficult to clean,"Hubby surprised me with a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion Hot Chocolate Maker for Christmas. Christmas morning I made up a batch of cocoa using some Swiss Miss packets. Easy and tasted great and no clumps either. Today, I made a batch of my low cal chocolate syrup, put a packet of dried milk and cold water in the machine and added the syrup. Within minutes I had a warm batch of lowfat, lowcal homemade cocoa. YUM.My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that the machine is all one unit. A bit difficult to clean but not that difficult. It's too bad the designers did not make this a separate carafe, much like a blender, so the carafe could be washed easily."
5,Simply the BEST!,"My husband and I bought this item a few years ago and we are addicted to it. We live in Texas, so unfortunately our winters aren't as cold as some, but we still enjoy our hot chocolate. I recall my mom making it the old fashioned way in a pan on the stove...stirring and stirring. But, this machines takes out the time and guess work. It's so easy to use, and the cocoa has come out perfect 100% of the time. We think it's one of our most used appliances and we wouldn't trade it for the world."
4,Great Cocoa Maker for the price,This cocoa maker really does make a great cup of cocoa! It heats it to the perfect temp and really whips the cocoa. We use ours every dayI gave this a four because the blending cup section doesn't detatch from the base making it harder to clean.
5,Throw the Spoon Away!!,"I have to agree with the earlier reviewer; this machine is great. Yes, the machine cannot be submerged, but one good thing is that the machine comes with a place on the bottom where you can store the cord--just wind it up and make sure it is locked and place. Wonderful--I have had this for a week and have used it everyday. It is great not just for hot chocolate, but for instant coffee as well. Just add the water or milk into the container, clearly marked for servings, dump in the powder or syrup and turn it on. No need for a spoon--that is the best part of all."
1,Makes great coco BUT!,"We only used it maybe 10 times and already the center ""spinner"" is falling apart and shedding ball bearings into the coco. I hope we've not consumed any, but how can you tell? I would have rated it zero stars but 1 star is the default!"
3,Good product,I purchased this at Walmart for under $20.00. I do not understand why this is priced so high. Wal-mart no longer carry this product. I loved it but it is definitely not worth $ 47.00 dollars. The one that I had only lasted about 2 years.
3,Loved It but it didn't last long,"I'd like to give this 5 stars because I loved it. It makes great hot chocolate very easily. I like that I can make four cups at one time. Unfortunately, after 2&1/2 months the ball bearings came out of the stirrer and now if I turn it on it makes a loud screaching noise. I wish I'd saved the receipt and could return it for a refund. The funny thing is, though, that despite this problem I enjoyed the machine so much that I'm going to buy myself another one. It's worth the risk of having it not last very long."
5,Truly unique.,"The photos, along with Di's beautiful poetry have made this book one of my favorites. Heart-wrenching and tough to put down, James Dean...Just Once More is a must have. Thank you Di!"
5,Straight from the heart,I loved the book. It was a fun and easy read that really drew me in. Any James Dean fan will charish the book.
5,A visual feast,"Exquisitely beautiful. nature as an art form, something like a very small Japanese garden. Magnificent photographs. This is like 3-D Chinese landscapes."
2,I hate this blender!,"bought this blender years ago and I hardly use it.You can't pour out of it without spilling,water gets in between the two layers and it takes forever to dry and then it leaves a dirty film,doesn't lock onto the base, so you have to stand there and watch it or hold it on. Can't find a replacement jar so I'm stuck with it till it quits working. VERY BAD PRODUCT."
1,The worst ever!,"This is the worst blender ever and its reflected in the price. I can't believe it's made by Oster and it's not. It's made by Oster Sunbeam. Maybe it is a strong motor, but the different speeds are useless and the blend speed even makes the blender hop across the counter. Maybe it should be called a rabbit blender. Do not buy no matter what. Get a better blender on sale at your local department store. Oster 10-Speed Blender - White"
5,great movie,"I've loved this movie since I was a kid and now my kids love it too! It's a cute tale of a girl who has to spin straw to gold in order to save her neck and hopefully get the prince. Great story, kids of all ages will like it."
4,Excellent product for my Jr high student,"The stand is great for the price, you must be careful when folding. It is not the thickest metal, but as long as you take care it will last."
2,Ridiculously flimsy,"For the price, I did not expect a miracle of construction, but this music stand reaches new levels of shoddiness. It feels like it's made of soda cans and paperclips.I bought this for my son, but I seriously doubt that it will survive one week in the care of an 11-year old.At least it comes with a bag so you can hide your shame at owning this rickety stand!"
4,Funny revenge movie!,"This movie is a very funny woman-takes-revenge-on-cheating-boyfriend movie... the basic story outline is that Zach Galligan's character is a ""player"", even though he has a gorgeous girlfriend played by Teri Hatcher. She basically gets fed up with his antics, so her friends get together and decide to punish him. I dont wanna give away what the girls do to this guy, but I have to admit that I found it all very amusing!"
1,Who wrote this mess,This is a patheically poorly written movie. It just drags on with everyone whining about evey thing. A waste of film.
3,Broadway songs,You need to have seen the play to appreciate these songs. A nice variety of vocalists however some of my favorite songs from the show are not included.
5,Wonderful Story,"My son really loves this book. He is four years old and, although he came to us at birth and we are the only parents he has ever known, he was adopted through the foster care system. It is very difficult to find appropriate books (he didn't cross an ocean and his parents didn't give him up out of love for him) that explain his adoption but I love how open and honest this one is. Rosie is open about her feelings and even expresses that she sometimes gets angry with her adopted parents for taking her away from her birth parents. As a mother who has always been extremely open and honest with her son about his adoption I find this book very refreshing. I think we will be able to use it for years to come."
3,Hit & miss,"This set is definitely too expensive for the value of the performance. The package is great - de luxe - contains 4 CDs, a huge booklet with lots of color photos, detailed information about the opera and libretto in several languages, all packed in a solid glossy box. In my opinion the orchestral and choral parts are top class as are most of the soloists. Unfortunately, Don Carlos ruins it for me. He shouts most of the time. Rodrigue's voice is too deep for my taste - almost better suited for the opera's grand inquisitor. I think Pappano's version with Alagna and Hampson is better and I am not an Alagna fan. If you can get a good used Opera Rara set for half the price, it may be worth it. But a hundred bucks?"
1,Not worth the money,"I was expecting a book. This is a packet of papers. The activities are shallow and the packet does not contain any activities more than what I could create on my own in a few minutes on the computer. It focuses on vocabulary and does not include anything creative, motivational, or very little that will even move students to engage in higher-order thinking. I am incredibly disappointed and will not be using any of the activities in my seventh grade classroom."
5,A transformational experience,"You might think this is a children's book for Easter, and I suppose it is. But when I first read it to my firstborn it was a transformational experience for me. Find out how to be a stay at home mom and still have a full life. I've worn out several copies and my daughters have permanantly borrowed a few."
5,Great Story,I remember this wonderful book from my chilhood fondly and am happy to have a copy once again! It tells an adorable story.
4,This is a small size book,"I love this book and it was a favorite of mine as a child which was the reason I wanted to give it as a special Easter gift. I made the mistake of not checking the dimensions and I assumed it was the same size as the regular hardcover. I was disappointed because when I received the book I was surprised to find that they have shrunk the size of the book, I guess to make up for the cost of the little charm. I think the smaller size takes away from the lovely illustrations and feel of the book. I don't have time to return it, but if I was ordering it again I would just get the larger book and skip the charm."
5,Better Get Them Now,"These filters get 5 stars because they appear to be the ONLY filters available for the 4 Cup Mr Coffee Maker.I bought my coffee maker at Target, couldn't find the filters for it and thought, oh well, I 'll just get them at the supermarket. Not available at the 4 markets I checked. Then I thought, I'll get them at [...]. They don't carry them. Then, I tried MrCoffee.com. Nope. I called the 1-800 number in my owners manual and customer service told me they no longer make filters for this machine and that I could purchase them at any supermarket. Maybe at her local supermarket in India, but not mine in Pennsylvania.So....if you just bought this coffee maker like I did, don't throw out the box or the reciept as quickly as I did.Or, you can do what I'm about to do, and purchse as many as these filters as possible (they don't make a gold filter anymore either!)"
4,great for imagination AND science,"I bought this for my 5 year old after he saw The Future is Wild series (one time, he borrowed it from a friend).From his love of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, he already had a good understanding of evolution and of change on this scale. The idea of taking it into the future is a fantastic one. He understands that these are just ideas, that these are not animals certain to live.He absolutely loves it. He is always creating the creatures with his legos or making them from all sorts of odds and ends around the house. He also creates other creatures and discusses what their adaptations are and why and how they work. It is great for his imagination as well as his understanding of some scientific principles. We've read the book many times and he really wants a copy of the DVD series."
2,flat basket rotisserie,"Not what it seems to be,you have to remove your grill plates before you can even use it,wish i would hve returned it"
2,Rotisserie Basket,"This item would have been fine if it hadn't arrived damaged. It has been returned and, previously, I wrote a review about the totally inadequate packing effort made by the shipper. The problem we had was not with the basket itself. In fact, I have since purchased and received an identical basket from another source."
3,Average,"Expensive for what I recieved. Furthermore, this product is NOT made in USA as advertised. It's made in China. I wouldn't purchase again if given the chance."
1,Garbage,"Tried the worthless product, hope spring eternal, the best I can say is it appears to be a fraud . SAVE your money!"
2,not as promised,"These bags do not do as they say. Of all the bags (of 5), only one stayed sealed. The larger bags looked like the air was removed, but by the next day the vacuum seal was gone. Too much money for what you get."
1,Not worth the money,I bought a large set of these bags. Less than half of them worked as they filled back up with air. I tried to contact the company for a refund but did not get a response.
1,Pretty much useless,"Very few of these bags do what is advertised. Just tried using 10 different bags, following the instructions. These were not the least bit overfilled. However of the 10 I tried 6 of them leaked from the seams around the edge. You could actually hear them leak and watch the bag expand. I imagine of the ones that didn't leak that quickly at least a couple will have a slow leak. Pure junk"
2,Waste of money,"I bought an 11-bag combo. Fifteen minutes after filling and vacuuming the air out (following manufacturer's instructions), the bags started losing air. I thought I had done something wrong and I vacuumed the air out again, but the bags starting losing air immediately after. What a waste of my money!"
1,All re-inflated,"C'mon! Whoever said that those of us who have had problems ""wasn't reading the instructions..."" etc...baloney. I bought several bags, several sizes, two different stores, different days...followed the instructions TO THE HILT. Many times. Every single bag has re-inflated.Since they apparently sometimes work, my conclusion is that their quality control is lousy, wih some bags being better than others. If that'sa risk you're willing to take, so be it, but save your receipts."
1,"After two months, it started slipping.","One would think that something as simple as a can-opener would last longer than a couple of months. Not this baby. When it was new it worked well enough, but it started to slip occasionally (spinning without turning the can), and now it will slip a half-dozen times on every single can I try -- everyhing from tuna to tomato paste to Progresso soup. STAY AWAY from this one."
1,Not Complete,"I just recieved this pot rack, but it did not hae instructions OR any equiptment to secure it to the wall. I ordered this online to aviod hoilday crowds, but now I'll need to go to the store anyway t pick up screws. The product itself looks heavy and solid, but I can't tell how well it will hang."
3,Ill-served by dialog format,I found Bohm's general thesis compelling but didn't like the dialog format of the book. The back and forth between Bohm and the questioner(s) is often disconnected and aimless and many times left me wondering if the two sides were really taking the time to understand one another.
3,Not A Historical Simulation,"This game is not a historical simulation, as the previous reviewer stated, even Johan, of Paradox Interactive (Maker of game) concedes this. It uses WWII as a backdrop for a very complicated version of Risk.It angers me when people misstate what a game is or is not. Also this is not a good platform to explore Alternate History because the nations do not have there actual historical military and economic capabilitys. Also AI cheats more than an most games. This is a very good game if you have human players to play all the major sides, an pretend this was the actual powers of that time."
2,"""Tinny Sound""","The price for this item was great, but the product is more a PC monitor than a television. Alas, another reminder that ""you get what you pay for"". The sound is tinny even with making numerous adjustments to sound using the menu."
5,Take a breath of morning air...,"Just read the first page of this book and you are immersed in the sights and sounds and smells of an early summer morning. Share some special moments with a father and child as they watch the world wake up. Creech creates wonderful and imaginative images of nature. When you open this book, take a deep breath and get ready for a taste of summer."
2,Can't get a sharp photo,"This lens was a hand-me-down so please keep that in mind when reading this review. It could be that the lens is just used.So with that out of the way, I can't seem to take a sharp image with this lens to save my life. I've tried it with and without the image stabilization feature, with and without a tripod, several ISO modes, several F stops and shutter speeds... nothing. I thought throwing it on a tripod, turning the IS feature off, and also having a 2 second delay would surely do the trick but to no avail, I zoom in on my photo and it's still slightly blurry.The photos look pretty good when you're not viewing at 100% but that's not very ideal. So, I'm glad I didn't pay money for this. Again, it could be that the lens has just been used too much, but I'd recommend spending some extra bucks on a higher quality lens. If you're looking to zoom in on your subject, I'm assuming that you want it to be sharp and this lens just isn't."
3,Missus Beastly - self-titled (CLMLP),"Originally released in 1970 - looks to be the band's first of four albums. Group's previous name was notably Psychotic Reaction. Beat that. Music here is decent - tunes I dug the most were the good German psych piece ""Uncle Sam"", the more bluesy ""Mean Woman"" and the jazzy ""Decision"". Maybe not something I'd listen to all that often, but every now and again. Personnel: Atzen Wehmeyer-guitar & vocals, Petja Hofman-bass & vocals, Wolfgang Nickel-keyboards and Lutz Oldemeier-drums. Just might pull in fans of - say... early Embryo, Siloah, Roman Bunka an maybe Eloy."
2,Heavy and and not economical,"Get the Rick Steves' books for Paris and France. The Eyewitness books are pretty. They have shiny paper and color pictures. But they are heavy to lug around, especially if you are on foot (which is the best way to see Paris!). And the recommendations for hotel and accommodations are not for the budget minded, in my opion. A much better travel book is the Rick Steves' Paris 2000. Included in this book are walking tours of the neighborhoods and major museums. In those he gives background and history that you might find from a personal tour guide. Steves also makes recommendations for hotels that are very nice, clean and safe and reasonably priced (with excellent restaurants). I bought the Eyewitness book and left it in a hotel room in Paris because I was so sick of lugging it around and it added nothing to my trip that I didn't get from the Rick Steves book. Have I said enough? Skip Eyewitness unless you have a big budget and like to carry heavy books."
5,High gauge plastic perfectly suited for the job.,I ordered this set as well as a set from another Mfg. This set is much much better. Tuff plastic and you can cut the circle size with the back side of each press. Pick up a set and have fun making all sorts of good eats in pockets. I plan to make my first Philly cheese paddies with Bison loin and chives. If you have a pasta machine you'll make some excellent boil ready giant ravioli.
3,It works!!!!!,This product works well for all types of pastries etc... I reccomend it for pierogie use!
1,Very Poor,"It doesn't fit on most stands and it has a very small hitting radius. The feel is pretty bad as well. I don't recommend it. Especially at the high cost, it is most certainly not worth it."
2,"Great product, however .....","We have used this brand name for many many years. Unfortunately, the current piticher and lid cannot be run through the dishwasher, it will warp. I don't understand why over the past 30 years the previous versions were dishwasher safe and now this pitcher has to be handwashed. Very frustrating."
5,Hand wash only,I bought and sent this pitcher to my mother after she warped hers in the dishwasher. This a very good value and it made her very happy. Very fast delivery.
3,replacement pitcher,The pitchers are fine. The only thing I don't like is that the picture shows a teal lid to match the system I have. But the color I received is blue. They don't match. It was the only reason I bought them. Other than that they are ok.
4,Handy Addition to Normal cookware,"This is a great addition to your normal set of pots and pans. It also makes a great gift. I gave this pan to my in-laws and they use it almost daily.This pan is a fairly shallow and is a great pan for baking or braising fish or chicken. I think this pan is ideal for most occasions where you are cooking for two to three people. The depth of the pan, however, prevents its use for large meals for groups of 4 or more people.The manufacturer recommends washing this pan by hand. While this is a reasonable request, I have thrown it into the dishwasher when it seemed too greasy to adequately clean by hand. I have not noticed any ill effects from the occaisional dishwasher treatment.I have noticed that the outside of the pan can become discolored with use. If you require ""pretty"" pans, perhaps this is not for you. However, if you want a pan that heats evenly, is quite durable and easy to clean, this pan is a good addition to your kitchen."
3,warped bottom after 2 years,"The honeymoon is over with this pan....it has now shown it's faults and betrayed me.I really loved this pan when I received it about 2 years ago. So many uses; from soups and chili to one-dish meals that needed to simmer. It is big and hefty and when I got it out to cook with, it gave me confidence.I didn't mind hand washing it and even forgave it for chipping my enamel sink.Well, lately it has been wobbly and spinning and tilting on the burner.....the bottom has warped a bit even though I have cared for it as the brochure instructed. No more quick and even cooking because the whole bottom isn't making contact with the (electric) burner. Now, for me, it's back to my faithful Revere ware.Oh well.....it was good while it lasted."
4,Great Deal,"I bought this for only $19.99. When I told my sister about it 2 days later the price was up to $29.99. She purchased it anyway, that was still a deal. The lid doesn't fit real secure, but it does cover the pan. It it well worth it."
1,It's NOT stick-resistant,"The product feature listing says the pan is STICK-RESISTANT. That's NOT true. Even a basic saute-ing sticks to the bottom of the pan like anything. So, if you're looking for a non-stick pan, please do not be misled by this phrase in the feature listing."
3,Big and Heavy,"This saucier is big and heavy. It occupies so much space on my four burner stove that make the burners behind and beside this saucier unusable. Also, it has a lot of metal so it takes a while to heat up even on a gas stove. Forget it if you have an electric stove."
5,My new favorite pan,"I've had my eye on this pan for months, and when I saw it on sale for 20 bucks, I bought it right away. Tonight my son came over for dinner and I made a huge batch of chili. The meat browned beautifully, no scorching or sticking. I love Caphalon hard anodized. My son, who rolled his eyes when I showed him this ""new"" pan (did I tell you I love Caphalon?), was astonished at how little I paid for it. When he watched me cook with it, he said, ""Mom, you should get me one of those pans."" It's still a deal at twice the price. It isn't even as heavy as I had anticipated. A breeze to clean. I'm going to use this pan a lot."
3,showing wear,It was great until it started to warp. I have a real wolf restaurant range that puts out a lot of BTU and I have noticed that this pot is warping. Not Good.
5,Ideal Chili Pot,"I really like this pot for stews and chili. There is a lot of room to saute onions and brown meat before liquid is added, and its much more convenient to do so than in a taller/narrower pot. Liquids reduce quickly, its easy to stir without spillage, etc.Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the lid fits my 12 inch saute pan (part of the 9-piece calphalon commercial hard anodized set).As another reviewer said, the pot is large. I haven't had quite the difficulties she has in using it on my stove, however. I cant put another 12 inch pan (saute or everyday pan) on the burner in front of it and have it centered over the flame, but have no trouble with smaller pans.And for the price, I really can't complain at all."
2,Missing Pages!,"THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT AT A CRITICAL POINT EARLY ON, THERE WERE ABOUT 40 PAGES MISSING!!! (VERY FRUSTRATING.) ALSO, LATER ON IN THE BOOK, ABOUT 35 PAGES WERE REPEATED!PHOOEY!"
3,Covers all Areas of Software Project Management,"Great for getting a general idea of the different aspects involved in Software PM, which is very different from general project management. Not many books exist that are as focused as this one on the management of the SDLC. However, this book is merely an introduction to each step and you will need additional references for a deeper understanding of any of the topics discussed in this book."
3,Okay.......,"Good read, I disagree with some of the characterizations,having been in Laos from 68 to 69,(Moung Soui, the PDJ etc) but then that's human nature. By the way David Pompelli's name is a misspelling. Should be Pompili, But then, what's in a name?"
5,Great Wire Jewelry,This is a beautiful book with thorough instructions. I look forward to making some of these projects.Great Wire Jewelry: Projects & Techniques (Lark Jewelry)
2,Great ideas but wire sizes incorrect,"I found this book to have great ideas for making chains. The one real problems is her wire sizes are not accurate. 20 gauge wire in not 1.0mm, 18 g wire is. All the wire sizes were wrong so it was hard to decide what size wire would work with which size ring. I generally don't have a lot of wire to waste.The Jens Pind's instructions were also very hard to follow and again it didn't flow right because of the wire vs ring size problem.I did like many of her designs and have made several of them. I would love to see her book come out with a second edition after more careful editing."
4,beginners book with a small focus,"I purchased this book at a jewelry crafting shop after leafing thru it, specifically for the chain mail instructions in the second half. for anyone interested in chain mail in a jewelry application this book is a good start, contrary to most of the online sources i found that focused on the armor and period specific applications of the art. as for the wire knitting, i do like some of styles but have also seen other books on wire weaving that were a bit better and had more clear instructions."
2,Not As Represented,Instructions are brief and incomplete. Inadequate photos or not helpful. Extremely disappointed in the entire book
2,Terrible GBA Game,This game is very lame and bad. The only thing that is good is the graphics and the character's description. The gameplay gets very boring really FAST!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!
2,Ughh,"Terrible if u really want to get Shrek Superslam do not get it on Gameboy Advance get it on Xbox, Gamecube, or PS2!"
4,Bratz Ooh la La,Gave this as a gift. The little girl loved it. Still having fun with it. Kept her busy for hours.
4,Good Primer,"The span of social elements attempted in this DVD is impressive. Unfortunately, sixty minutes is insufficient to really provide detail. The viewer comes away with many questions. Notwithstanding that, if you want an entry level primer into British society that references pre-Edwardian periods and is relatively inconclusive on post-Edwardian periods, this may be for you. Well narrated and beautiful country house footage - it just attempted much and was edited down to a beginner level."
2,secrets of the manor house,"i did not know it was a documentary, not fond of these. thought it was a movie and i will not buy another"
4,Works fine so far.,"I'm using this on a Charbroil 3-Burner ""RED"" grill and it fits without modifications. It seems to be reasonably sturdy and runs very quietly. I can't comment on reliabiliy since I've only cooked two meals so far. Both were very tasty! This rotisserie is rated at 20 lbs. I don't take that rating seriously! I cooked two chickens at just under 10 lbs total. That worked out fine but I don't think you could do much more then that without running into trouble."
3,Char-Broil 4984722 Premium Electric Rotisserie,"This item has not been used as of late as the apartments I live in does not allow anyone to BBQ anyware on the property, because the insurance people said so like stucko is going to burn."
1,Weak Motor,I bought this rotisserie about a year ago. I would not reccommend it. The motor almost always bogs down and eventually shuts off. You have to babysit it and manually tun the handle to get the motor turning again. It seems that the motor just isn't powerful enough. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.....
1,rotisserie,"First motor did not work, returned the entire item. the second item arrived and the motor sounds so bad , I went out and got an after market motor to use. Everything else is fine the motor is really poor!"
3,electric rotisserie,there is a lot of parts to put this electric rotisseria togetherr. I came outt with a few extra bolts.
5,The Best,"I have found the Operation Flashpoint games to be the most realistic games I have played. They not only present the player with challenge, but also offer varying scenarios each time you log into a particular segment of the game. I have played the original and the two expansions many times and continue to be challenged by them. I own many similar type games but always seem to come back to these. I would highly recommend these games to anyone who likes the war action type games."
5,the expansion to the orig OFP...,"great weapons adds, the BMP-2, and some nice scenarios.OFP rly started the FPS warstyle game off right more than a decade ago.i got my original copy back around 2001 and i still play it often.5*"
4,Measure your saucepan first.,"This is a beautiful, well-constructed piece; however, be very careful to measure your saucepan first. I looked on the bottom of my pan prior to purchasing this item and verified it was a 2-1/2 qt. saucepan, but I did not know Calphalon has a ""shallow"" saucepan and regular saucepan. The ""shallow"" saucepan that I have is just over 8-1/2"" in diameter across the top rim. The double boiler measured right around 7-1/4"". I had to go to the Calphalon website to purchase a regular narrow/tall saucepan so that this insert will fit. Please measure your saucepan first or be prepared to get another in order to use this product. It gets 4 stars because I had to drop an additional $80 at Calphalon to get it to fit."
5,Very pleased,"In this household there are two people, but we go through a gallon of tea a day. We had just wore the second pitcher out and was dreading having to purchase another unit. On a whim, I went to Amazon and was pleased to see they had the pitchers.I ordered two.They arrived soon after ordering and were put into use within an hour after they were received.They were well worth the price and such good service."
5,Tea Pitcher,Best price I could find...and the genuine article! (Hand wash it! DON'T put it in the dishwasher...it'll crack it! That's WHY I had to get a replacement! Hahahahaha!)
4,"Love Mr. Coffee Tea, just wished they made a glass pitcher","The tea is awesome but the pitcher not so much so. I discovered a trick to clean a tea stained pitcher. Since you cannot use it in the dishwasher, try soaking it in a sink with dish washing detergent for about 15 minutes. All of the stains come clean and the pitcher is like brand new.Gotta love Cascade simply for cleaning the brown out!Happy Brewing."
1,Very Poor Quality!!,"8 months ago I bought a new tea maker and a spare pitcher. Within months both began leaking from the bottom of the front seam ""in the notch"" on the base.Less than a month (Sept 25th) I ordered 2 replacements, and began using one as soon as it arrived. Last night, less than a month out of the box, it began leaking IN THE SAME PLACE.. It has not been dropped or banged around, nor put in a dishwasher or scalding water. The pitchers are simply poor quality. I have 1 more spare pitcher, and when it breaks, Mr Coffee has lost my patronage"
1,Mr. Coffee TP3-1 Replacement Iced Tea Pitcher,The heat from the original machine warped the plastic replacement pitcher during the first use. The pitcher is now unusable.
2,Watch your model numbers closely,"I purchased this picture thinking it was the right one for my Tea Maker but I was wrong. However, I was able to find the tea maker it does go with at a second-had store. My advice, watch your model numbers closely to make sure the replacement you order is the right one. Also I have a couple of recommendations for those of you who make ice tea with these types of pictures. Use a large cup to place the the ice in the picture, this will reduce the scratches, knicks and cracks on the top of the picture. Also, hand wash it."
1,I will be looking for a different brand,"I had 2 of the original styles of the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker. The only reason I had 2 was because the pitchers wore out and I couldn't find a replacement pitcher. The tea maker itself was wonderful. Easy to clean & trim line. The replacement takes up too much room in the refrigerator, it is hard to clean, the pitcher is bulking to handle and it leaks at the pitcher spout when it is filling. I make a pitcher of tea every day. I will be looking for a new style. Mr. Coffee should go back to the old style since you can now get extra pitchers."
4,Be Careful With That Home Made Peach Ice Cream!,"This is another well produced NOVA offering that this time centers on the infamous ""Typhoid Mary!"" I've heard the name/ phrase all my life but never really knew it referred to a real person with a real story until viewing this DVD. Her story is well told through dramatic reenactments supposedly using the character's real words, vintage photos, and modern day health and historical experts. And whether Mary was an unknowing victim or a vindictive villain is given fair coverage without reaching a real conclusion."
5,Great cutters,"I knew these would be a good quality cutter coming form Xuron, but they are even better than I thought they would be. Cut through track like butter, and I have used them for some fairly heavy guage wire as well. Built solid and very comfortable to grip. They dont get much better than this."
2,As an Elizabeth George fan I am disappointed in her latest,"I was surprised and disappointed that George's work In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner left me totally bored, dismayed, and repulsed. It seemed to have little saving graces. I couldn't stand Tommy, his pompous inability to see beyond his own vanity was not the Tommy I knew and liked. Barbara is annoying in her hope that Tommy will come around - I wish she would have been less eager and forgiving when he finally did instead of excusing his bad behaviour. (note my English spelling). Because I have enjoyed all of the other novels so much I will look forward to reading the next one. I found the world of S&M not my cup of tea but I appreciate the author's bravery in showing us its degradations. No more of that please!"
3,Too long,"I stuck with all 594 pages of ""In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner"" because I figured the end must be fabulous to justify the long slow pace of the book. It wasn't worth it.The book is the story of the search for the killer of two young people. Scotland Yard and the local police are working on different facets of the case, and we are fed the clues and facts they collect in a painstakingly slow manner."
3,My least favorite in the series,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. Having read all of E. George's mysteries, I was surprised at just how dispassionate and bland this particular novel was. Although there were some redeeming segments, overall, it was almost as though the author was attempting to demonstrate her newly discovered purience, rather than reestablish the beloved characters she has created. Helen, in particular, lost all allure - in the past her charm, candor, intelligence and wit were so so winning, but this time she was almost a cardboard cut-out.The ending was somewhat delightful and helped redeem the unnecessarily lengthy, droll tale."
2,Annoying,"It seems that many of the other reviews on this book are based on personal religious preferences, or sympathy towards the person of More himself, rather than being based on the merits of the book.Although the life of More always interested me, I found this book annoyingly digressing. Chronologically reciting life events for a biography is a dry business, and it is understandable for a biographer to insert occasional digressions and speculations about the character's psychology, the times in which he lived, the Renaissance in general, etc.But with Marius (the author), this resource the norm. And frankly, most of them are too extended, without adding much to your knowledge of More.I could only read until page 70 of his 550-page book. Then I decided that I cannot pass judgment about Mr Marius scholarship, because I cannot tolerate him as a writer."
5,This tape sticks through swimming and sweating.,I use this tape to keep my insulin pump pods tight to my skin. It stays stuck through swimming and intense sweating yet comes off easy enough when I remove it leaving no residue on my skin. I've had my pods come loose without it and at 50 or more dollars a crack that adds up quick. It is well worth the cost of this tape and beyond.
4,One of Grayson's biggest fans,"I've enjoyed Grayson Capps music from the time he was with Stavin Chain. His music is unlike any other musician out there. It bleeds New Orleans flavor and his voice resonates each song's true colors. He's an excellent story teller and this newest album accomplishes that. From the hurricanes and hardships these songs personify a more country, mellow twang than his previous album. I personally enjoyed his previous album slightly more but the songs contained in Wail & Ride are unique in their own way. My personal favorite is ""Give it to Me""."
4,Good Game,"I bought this game for my 6 year old son. He really enjoys playing it. He says Mega Man 8 is much better, however, he plays this quite often. He enjoys the challenges of getting to another level."
4,Get the first one first,"This game rocks, but you really should play the first one all the way through before you start on the second. The bosses in the second are a lot more dificult so it's good to have kind of a hang for Mega Man's movement and weapons."
4,For Mega Man Lovers...,"MML2 is the same as MML except for better improvment on the graphics,characters,and story.Capcom has also added more hours to the game so you'll be playing with the blue bomber longer fighting new bosses,using better & stronger weapons and in bigger areas than ever before...Some of the old MML characters are back in MML2 and some new ones were added to spice-up the story...To me MML2 still has the same easy to use controls and It still gives you that I wanna play some more feel even if you've already beat it...It's a MUST buy"
4,Well worth it...,"I stumbled upon this CD by accident while reviewing music. I can safely say this CD is what turned me on to electronic music. Since then I've found better, but this CD still remains a favorite of mine. Unlike another review I love the vocals, it was part of what attracted me to this album. I just wish I knew where to find more information about them."
1,Won't load!,No idea if the game works - it won't load on two different computers. I hate it when companies release games that aren't ready for the market.
5,me and the kids love it,"I've owned one for years. You know kids and french fries, and my kids like to use to make their own curly fries [...] It is safe for the kids to use. It has different blades it can slice and make curly fries, and you can buy another blade to make hashbrowns. The only problem I have is the clear basket breaks after about a year, and I have to replace it (if I can find the catalogue.)"
4,As advertised,"As advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud. I have to block my ears when it's running but I had expected that so I'm not complaining. My one complaint is that the ""water tight"" lid is not and if I fill it up too full liquid comes out the top.I use it for fruit smoothies (no ice) and vegetable soups and they come out very smooth."
5,Love this blender!!!!,"I use this blender every morning to make a protein shake, and I use about 12 ice cubes (instead of the 5 or 6 indicated in the product instructions). All of the ice is ground up smoothly with no chunks, and it does it in just a few seconds! I have been mourning the demise of my thirty year old Osterizer blender - it was the perfect blender! I've tried other blenders, but I was very disappointed in the ice crushing ability of each one. The 4125 works like my original blender that I loved. The best part is that this one has more features. It make great milk shakes, and it has done a good job with routine food processing jobs.I don't think this blender is as loud as I was led to believe by reading the other reviews. It is actually quieter than my old one and the other models I have recently tried, and it works so quickly that the noise is not an issue at all for me.I highly recommend this model for anyone looking for a heavy duty blender."
4,very powerful,"This blender is very well made and has plenty of power, so be sure to hold the lid down."
5,Passion! Philosophy! Love and Music!,I've lived this movie! Perfection. I don't know how it could be better. I can't say much more... you need to see it. De Profundis!
1,Earth Odyssey: Around,"Sorry to say the seller sent as promised, but I never recieved it. The seller did not respond to any of my emails. HOWEVER, Amazon was very quick in helping me out and putting in a credit for the product."
4,another exit into enigma,"samael takes another drastic change in their music style. they finally make a full turn out of satanic imaginary into galatic reincarnation and identity searching. all this somehow makes us feels that good music is always about changes and metamorphism. for true samael fans who follow their steps back from blatant satanic phrases in blood ritual and ceremony of opposite into simple classic black metal approach in exodus and passage up until recent eternal will notice how black metal is transform into techno postgothic rock scene.the only setback in eternal is that some tracks are way too soft. in a whole, this album still elevate samael's reputation as switzerland foremost metal outfit ps: best track ""the cross"" and ""supra karma"""
5,Buy this book! It's going to be a collectors item!,"Now I know that I should write a review illustrating how good this book is, and how practical its advice is, and how lucid the prose is, (all of which is true), but the thing that made me buy this book was 10 little words:""Introduction by His Holiness the Dalai Lama"" and ""Printed in China.""Yep. *That* China.I don't know how long this edition of the book will be in print, but it's definitely unique.Having bought the book I would agree that of all the Mahayana texts I've read, this is quite accessible, with beautiful illustrations, and should be read by anyone who wants to seriously study Buddhism. Of course, the tale told is mythical/metaphorical, but the logic and wisdom is profound.One minor quibble: I'd have appreciated a bit more of a scholarly preface and historical background."
1,IGNORANT WASTE OF TREES,"There's many theories, ignorant ones, of who killed him but if you were to truly love Nirvana and Kurt and read into him, you would know, not wonder, that HE KILLED HIMSELF. It's disrespectful to him to say that Courtney killed him. She LOVED him. He LOVED her and she would never do that. The reason she didnt do interviews and talk and stuff wasnt because she's hiding anything. IT'S BECAUSE SHE LOVED HIM AND IT'S NONE OF SOCITIES BUISNESS TO KNOW THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. AND SHE WAS GRIEVING. Wouldnt you be?"
1,A incorrectly titled book of one suicidal man,"Basically, Nirvana was just a great band of music..bottomline. They really weren't about, nor did well in publicity issues, such as this book. Frankly, I am a true believer that this author was unaware of the meaning of nirvana before writing all about Kurt. Such a state needs to be realized and understood in order to understand and especially write about this man of brilliance. I would only read this book under an impression of non-fiction, for I am firm on my beliefs that this is a poor and ilicite illustration of Kurt Cobain. The real title of this book should be Did Kurt Cobain achieve his nirvana?"
4,Why is the murder theory case not re-opened?,"A superb book full of facts and stories relating to the mysterious events and unsolved circumstances relating to the death of my hero, Kurt Cobain. Was his sucicide note just a musical retirement note to his loving fans? Why is there someone else's handwriting on the so called suicide note? The legal systems in America must re open this case and send whoever killed Cobain down...Courtney Love? I recomend this book to anyone...even if you hated NIRVANA and thought Cobain was just a junkie, read this book and bring Cobain's killer to justice."
1,Be warned...this is not a good read!,"I have enjoyed most of this author's previous books, but this one felt ""phoned in.""I never bought into the story, didn't care for the characters, and saw through the entire scenario after the first 50 pages.I wish promising authors weren't pushed to publish and could take their time to develop plots and characters we can enjoy.This book was a waste of my time and I won't be asking the library to hold anymore of her volumes for me. My spare time is too precious to waste on such nonsense."
5,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read!,"This is an amazing book! I'm not one to go to the mistery section and look for a book, but this book is truly captivating...I couldn't put it down! It's an easy read, which is good once in a while and it's the type of book that when you've finished it, you're sad. You're missing out if you don't read this book!"
4,Nicely done,Wealthy attorney frames himself for his wife's murder. Not giving any spoilers away- Scottoline had a few tricks up her sleeve with this one.
4,What a surprise!,"This was my first Lisa Scottoline book and I loved it! It was such a pleasant surprise. From the first page, I was hooked. The book begins with a lawyer trying to frame himself for murder. Imagine that! It makes you keep reading to find out what happens! Kuddos! This was great."
3,I was disappointed.,"Perhaps my expectations were too high. I have heard good things about Ms. Scottoline and this book had good reviews. I liked the protagonist, Mary Denuzio. She was believable as a newbie lawyer with a Catholic school background. But the romance aspect seemed forced. The mystery itself was pretty good, but it was very drawn out. It almost felt like a screenplay with lots of chase scenes. It will be awhile before I consider another one of her books."
3,Lacks Excitement,"The first book I read by Scottoline was ""Courting Trouble"" and that book was so so. I decided to give the author another try so I chose an older novel, ""Moment of Truth."" Unfortunately, this book is very dry. The only excitement I experienced with this book was finishing it. Sorry."
2,A frictionaly plot with holes more than swiss cheese.,"The Female ""John Grisham"" Lisa Scottoline is over rated.I can't finish reading the Moment of Truth because I can't be cheated on and keep cheering.Suppose you go home, you found your wife brutally stabbed to death by a butcher knife. What would you think? Would you draw a conclusion right away that your 16 years old fragile daughter must be the murderer?Suppose your father is on way to electrical chair to protect you. Would you lie to father in order to protect your boy friend?The whole story is unbelievable."
3,The Mozart Season,"The Mozart Season is a book about a child prodigy named Allegra. She is twelve years old and she plays the violin. She has gotten into a prestigious competition for young violinists. Being in this competition means Allegra has to practice everyday. She has to spend her whole summer playing Mozart's fourth concerto in D, over and over again. The competion means everything to her. She thinks about it every day and every night. Along this journey Allegra meets lots of interesting people, including an eccentric opera singer with a dreadful past, a mysterious old man, and also finds out about an important fact about the Holocaust in her family's history.In my opinion, the book was very slow. The whole book, Allegra just talked about what she did. There was no action. The only suspenseful part was when Allegra was playing in the competition. I would not recommend this book this book to people who like suspenseful and action packed books.~Kiri"
5,Nice an easy to get on and off,Nice an easy for patients with hard time closing tie gowns.These fasten with a velcro and are a real pleasure to work with.
5,"great for 1000-1500, good for 1500-1700, not for 1700+","I would like give this book 4.5 stars.It has 200+ puzzles, basically. Majority of them are goodfor 1000-1500. 1500-1700 rated people will benefit b/cof the practice, b/c there are definitely some tough ones.negative point:this idea of ""target"" really does not work evry wellin real life. These should have been presented indifferent context. e.g. What is white's best move?Then, each could have been explained in terms whatshould have tipped off the reader to the breakthrough tactics.It still deserves 4.5 stars b/c they are so manyto practice with and they are all good ones (someare easy, sure, but not all).If you are over 1700, most likely you will not benefitfrom this."
5,Great book for beginners,"If you are just starting to get into guitar and music theory, this is a GREAT book. It is very well illustrated and has great exercises that will help you understand the material very quickly.I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting the journey, you will learn all the basics and how to navigate the fretboard.I've been playing for close to 2 years but was lacking deeply in theory. After reading and doing a few of the exercises I understand the fretboard a lot more.Worth the money."
5,Very helpful,Good exercises. Well thought out. I am working slowly thru the material but the theory has helped my playing. Highly recommended if you are serious about playing guitar with finesse.
5,Where has this been my whole life?,"Let me just start off by saying that I am about 95% self taught on the guitar. I picked up my brothers and started to play around with it when i was about 10, he showed me a few chords, and off I went. I understand theory moderately well, as I played trumpet in high school band, but the guitar remained a mystery to me for a long time. The last year or so I felt like I hit a wall in my learning. Just got this book today and started on the 8th page, and after reading the first exercise, I thought to myself ""Where has this book been for the last 10 years!?"" If you've been playing a few years or more, and you feel like you're at a stand-still in your understanding of the guitar don't hesitate, get this book."
5,Excellent book for learning a few tricks to navigate the fretboard!,I like the workbook style of this book. Very easy and understandable for beginners and pros.
5,UPS that Works,We have six of these and have not experienced any problems. Our power is dirty in the summer and this UPS seems to have resolved all issues for us.
1,Works Well But Flimsy,"I've had this blender for a couple of years. When I first received it as a gift I honestly thought it wouldn't work because the jar does not fix securely in place. But, it worked and it has been working great until I decided to put some hot liquid into it and I was holding the flimsy top with a pot holder when all of the sudden the filler cap falls into the blender and grinds up with every thing else. So, much for what I was blending, but now I can't use the stupid thing because I no longer have a lid with a cap. I wouldn't waste your money on this - buy something sturdier!!"
3,Relaxation and meh.,"This video is bare bones and according to the recording times via my Amazon Video On Demand that I was able to rent on my TiVO, is only 15 minutes of recording. The time on Amazon's site says 38 minutes. It was in my opinion short and had no menu. I expected it to offer more choice and instructions, step-by-step, background info, etc. I have also found better video quality on YouTube. It looked like homemade video and very low quality. It even showed a few seconds of blunders at the end. Definitely NOT worth $30 for the video. Renting it was definitely the way to go. Saying that, it did cover all that it stated and was very basic QiGong that anyone can do."
5,What a wonderful book!,"This book had it all. It's romantic, funny and mysterious! I truly got a good feeling after reading, and I highly recommend this one. Enjoy!"
2,Disconnects every 20 min for no reason,"I've gone through about four of these hubs at my office. Each and every one has had the exact same problem...after about 20 minutes, I lose my network connection. To fix it I have to unplug the Ethernet cord and re-plug it back in. An easy fix, but boy is it annoying to have to do this every 20 minutes, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.Plus, if you connect remotely to your work computer as I do, you rely on that always-on connection to do that. What a nasty surprise when you attempt to connect to that machine and find that it's offline due to the stupid Netgear hub!"
2,NOT DURABLE AT ALL!!,"This mixer has really good power, and the idea with the spatula and extra beater attachments were great and leared me into purchasing it although... this mixer died on me only after 2 uses. I would highly recommend not wasting your money on this. Spend an extra five bucks and get a mixer that will last you through baking a cake. Boo- hoo black and decker!!"
1,mine died too,"Died during the 2nd use. I got on line, checked the reviews and saw 2 reviews out of 5 noted it died either during or after the 2nd use. Make mine the 3rd."
3,They must have changed it,"I've had one of these for 5 years. I don't use it every day but it works fine. I agree that it's pretty strong but I thought all hand mixers were like that. Wanted to get one for Mom for Christmas and was surprised to hear of problems with it. Their quality must have gone down in the last few years. Anyway, I'll check out the Braun or the Michael Graves one from Target instead."
5,A great practical guide,"If you are new in channels of distribution, this is a must read book! It gives you a very good insight on how to design, implement and manage your channel. The chapter on channel conflict specially draw my attention. The title of this book should read ""Practical Guide on Managing Channels of Distribution"". I don't think there is other book like this one. Congratulations to Ken."
2,Steamy but pretty bad,"Typical ""Skinemax"" fare. Have plenty of Kleenex on hand when things finally start to heat up."
4,TRIOS,I FEEL THAT THIS FILM IS A MUST SEE IF YOUR ARE A KENYA MOORE FAN AND IF YOU LIKE SUSPENSE. I LET ALL MY FRIENDS WATCH IT ALSO AND THEY LOVED IT. ALL I CAN SAY IS IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT.
4,Too cute,I brought this for my daughter who is 3 and she loves it. She takes her baby everywhere. she has the stroller combo and she has not put it down since we got it. You do have to take the screws out to reposition the handle but it takes 2 seconds and yes I guess the screws could get lost but if you take them out and put them back in then what is the problem. ours is a keeper
3,The doll car seat,"When I saw this for not much money I had to buy it. But I chose not to. There is a reason why it is only that price. Cute and real looking? Yes, but reliable and durable no. This brakes easily and screws pop out, so it is very possible for a small child to choke."
1,Poor Quality,"The handle on the item is not long enough to swivel to all 3 positions. You need to remove it and re-attach it to set it for the feeding position. One of the knobs broke in the first two hours of play. This toy was being used by a 5 year old, well with in the age range recommended. Save yourself the aggravation of buying a toy that doesn't work or last."
5,Cute Travel seat,"We looked at the more expensive travel seats, and then I saw this one, which was a bunch cheaper.My daughter, who is 2, loves it.It has held up just fine so far."
3,belt slips through too easily,"This armband works just fine, and is comfortable. I have one major complaint, however. The band slips through the clip easily, allowing your ipod to launch itself off your arm, with only the earphones to save it (if you're lucky). The weight of the ipod pulls it unexpectedly. Other arm bands I have had with tape players have a flap or crimp at the end of the band so this can't happen.It's not pretty when your mini hits the ground from 5 feet up. Fortunately, no ill effects yet, but it is heart-attack producing."
5,Great Product,This product was perfect exactly as advertised. This is the second one I have purchased this product met all my needs and more. These are original cartdridges and are not refurbished.
3,Refurbished product,"The wording here is clever - don't let it fool you though, you are probably not getting a brand-new HP cartridge. It's a re-furb. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but don't plan on a nice factory fresh cart in an HP box showing up. Initial tests show it works fine, print looks good. No idea if it will meet or beat the OEM cart capacity though at this time."
3,"Like others said - good product, crummy customer service","I purchased this coffee/expresso maker for my husband for Christmas. Upon attempting to make the first pot of expresso the handle snapped off of the filter holder. I called Krups,. who promised to send a replacement part. Now, a month & a half later I called to ask where it is. Well, my order is still in the system, but it is on backorder & they ""have no idea when it will be in"".The coffee maker side has worked fine (the timer works great if you remember to set the am/pm setting :) The expresso & frother work fine. My husband keeps a pair of pliers on hand to seat the filter holder that is missing a handle. It would just be nice not to need this kind of work-around on a brand new machine."
2,POOR LONGEVITY,"I have one of these machines and it was great as long as the warranty was in effect. 13 months after purchase the expresso side died. We've tried cleaning it with vinegar, running a wiore through it and it won't steam any more. It seems like an expensive machine to give out in 13 months of home use."
2,Leaking from the side,"I've had this machine for less than two years. I use it nearly every day. I'm terribly disappointed in a leak it has developed along the side of the machine. This morning I woke up to a half cup of coffee and water all over my counter. The leak is coming from the side of the machine, apparently through a seam. It looks as though the price has gone up on this machine as well."
2,"Coffee pot good, espresso maker not good","I love having a combination machine. However, the espresso maker really, really does not work well. When you tamp down the coffee grounds it clogs up and the water can't pass through. You end up getting about 2 drops of espresso at a time. To make one espresso drink, I have to brew it about 3 times. It's quite inconvenient. I'm just waiting for my machine to break so I can justify getting a different one!"
3,"Decent drip, weak expresso","I have to admit I've been using this machine for a couple of years and quite enjoyed it, although the expresso has never really been up to par with commercial expresso (and always had some grounds mixed in). And it can't really handle it if you pack the expresso grounds a little.I recently visited a friend's house and tried their expresso machine - WOW! The difference was quite dramatic - I'm definitely chucking this baby to get a 'real' expresso machine. (I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 because it's a good value for folks who aren't so picky - it's always impressed visitors and made decent pseudo-expresso).Also, you've really got to stay and watch the coffee if you want to foam your milk because it only foams for about 90 seconds. So don't turn your back to cook the rest of your wife's breakfast."
2,Wish I had the same success as others,"I have this espresso / coffee machine and loved it until recently. I use to make cappuccino often, but, recently steam started coming now thru the frothing arm but through the top of the boiler cap. I started to fix this by replacing the rubber ring inside the boiler cap and then by trying to replace the boiler cap, to no avail. I've looked at sending this unit to get repaired, but, then I wouldn't have any coffee either. No more combo units in my future. I'll probably go to a single espresso machine and a coffee press.Ammendment to the product review (9 June 2004): This product works great again. It turns out I didn't clean the frothing arm well enough. Apologies and keep up the good work, Krups!"
4,Nice Machine,"Ok, was very skeptical at first (I bought it from a guy at a garage sale that claimed he got it as a house warming gift and never used the espresso side). This machine does everything it says it does! One note, when your heating milk shut the espresso down half way thru the process, you'll get nice foam results because you'll have plenty of steam. Be careful with the Espresso Filter Holder, I broke the handle off mine the first day I had it! (I was probably man handling it... lol) Over all A+++"
4,Great quality espresso from a boiler system,"This machine is amazing! It produces up to four shots of high quality of espresso. The only complaint I have is that the black tips on the ""Perfect Froth"" attachment are very easy to lose. Other than that, I would recommend this machine to anybody."
4,Good Coffee Maker from a non-coffee drinker!,"I gave this gift to my sister and her husband as a wedding gift, and they have done nothing but rave about it and make coffee and expresso for all their guests. They love the design and the easy to use functionality of this machine. I personally don't drink coffee but I would recommend this as a must have appliance to any serious coffee connoisseur."
5,The best wu album from the best wu artist,"I've been a wu fan since the dawn of 36 chambers and I have always regarded Inspectah Deck as their best artist. I have anticipated a solo album from Deck for over five years and ""Uncontrlled Substance"" was definetly worth the wait. Everything about the album stands out. The production is brilliant. Every single one of Inspectah's verses make you want to bob your head to the beat. Inspectah ""is a sire and sets the microphone on fire""."
1,are you people ill?,"""too many songs, weak ryhmes is mad long. make it brief son, half short, twice strong."" sometimes you gotta take your own advice."
4,Inspectah Deck shows Wu is always on top!,"Personally, i find this cd very tight..overall it is one of the better solo albums with great tracks from beginning to end. In some areas i do wish the production was done just a little bit, making some sounds more rugged and old-wu. But what it turned out to be is fine with me. ins shows off his superior lyrical skill and is backed up on a couple tracks with U-god (marginal skills?? wait till U-god comes out, its gonna be a phat wu album as well, U-god is phat!!),and a nice one with killarmy and street. All in all, ya'll should seriously pick up this album, cuz it is tight. Not EXACTLY perfect, but very close"
2,yawn.,"This book is based on a clever concept and the faux-disease names are amusing. I expected it to be hilarious. Instead, it made me yawn. The writing itself plodding, rather than clever. I'm not much of a sci-fi reader, though. I thought mistakenly this might be a good way into the genre."
3,"Why not pay less for something that is going to ""just"" work?","Ok...the fellow that reviewed several before me made a good point. You don't want to use this in an enterprise environment...DUH! I'm an MCSE and I wouldn't recommend this card to any company, BUT, for the home there is absolutely nothing wrong with this card. It works and you can get 2 or 3 at the price of one of those big dog names. Do those work 2-3 times better? No, they don't. I have 3 PC's of my own at home...6 altogether in there and all have different NIC cards. NetGear performs just as well as the others and I wouldn't complain if I had one of their cards in every one of those machines.So, in short, setting up a corporate LAN/WAN? Then don't pick up one of these cards. Got a couple of computers or just one and want to play network games with friends...save a few bucks and go buy one of these and use what you saved on something else."
2,Versatile not Durable,"The Netgear FA-310TX 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet PCI Card uses the Tulip chipset which is widely supported. Most Operating Systems have a driver which will support this card right out of the box. For that reason it is very effective in computers where you want a low cost solution for systems running non-Microsoft operating systems.My only fault with the card is that is uses a flash ROM on the board. This ROM chip is very sensitive. Removing the card for any reason often wipes out the data stored on the ROM. Since Netgear has no patch capable of re-flashing the chip this renders the card unusable.If you do not intend to upgrade your computer, this is a great low cost board. However if you think you will need to open the case for any reason, I reccomend finding a different solution."
2,not great,"i don't think that this book is anything special. if you're already fit and are looking for ways to change your fitness routine during pregnancy, this book isn't all that helpful. if you're new to working out, it may benefit you more."
2,A Waste of Money,"I was excited to get this book because I have the Buff Brides edition and love it. However, this book isn't set up the same. Buff Brides as a workout schedule in the back of the book that allows you to know which exercises to do which day. This book only shows pictures of all the workouts that are safe to do while pregnant. I was expecting it to provide examples of which exercises to do together on certain days. While the information about working out safely is useful, it's nothing that can't be found by searching online."
2,Kind of annoying,"It is like all old workout videos; the people and comments by the ""host"" are kind of annoying. I am just entering my second trimester and the stretches don't really do much for me then the host gets on and is like now didn't that stretch feel great. and you know how we all think no and want to throw the box at the tv but i keep going. the cardio segment is pretty good; it makes me breath harder and break a sweat. the instructor really doesn't seem like she should be doing it; she breaks some key rules while teaching. the one that gets me the most is how she does lunges where her knee is clearly going over her toe; as an athletc trainer i know this is a big nono - especially for preggo girls who have looser joints to begin with. i am doing this now just to stay in shape until i get a different video! it does a good job in working the arms but i don't feel much in my legs. good luck and have a happy and healthy pregnancy."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"After becoming an instant fan of Donny Hathaway from hearing ""Extensions Of A Man"", I was totally unprepared for the genius on this album. This is probably only one out of a handful of albums that blew my mind on first listen. I hate to say it, but I think he up's Marvin one notch on ""What's Goin On"". As far as I can tell, the funky ""The Ghetto"" is the greatest jam of all time. A must have for anyone."
2,"Fabulous music, terrible audio quality","It's heartbreaking to write a bad review about this record. I got the vinyl LP when it first came out and still have it.That 1972 LP is pure magic to listen to and it changed my life.This CD release is horribly remixed and remastered from the original. I was appalled when I first started listening to it. Willie Weeks' bass has gone from a warm, enveloping embrace to a distant muddled boom. Everything is out of balance. It is completely disheartening.Criminal for them to take such a treasure and diminish its legacy in this way."
4,Great little machine for the money...,"This is a cheap machine, so if you're expecting to make the same exact coffee you get from the $10,000+ Starbucks machine then you're asking too much.That said, I have to review this product highly because I've had mine (older model but pretty much the same) for over 5 years now and it's NEVER had any problems. I really never expected to have it so long, especially being a student who regularly used it 3+ times a day.All in all it makes a good espresso if you use good grinds (really fine takes longer) and it's well worth the price.Now that I'm a little older and have a little more cash I'm planning to upgrade becuase a few more features would be nice (ie. a tank for water so I don't have to fill it everytime). I'm still going to keep this guy around as a backup in case whichever ""upgrade"" I buy doesn't have the same endurance."
1,seal lasted one week,"Don't waste your time with this one. We got it, used it a couple times a day and at the end of a week it would no longer maintain a good seal and thus push no water through the grounds."
4,The 90's called and want their desserts back,"This was written in the 90's and the creations reflect that, but I made the quick puff pastry and it turned out great, unlike previous puff recipes I've tried. The techniques are excellent, they never are out dated and the tips to go with the techniques really make things work well. The savings on just the puff pastry that I will enjoy will easily pay for this book. Excellent work!!!! Thanks"
3,For Bicycling Racing Fans,"If you are a big fan of bike racing and the Tour de France (before Lance) then this book may appeal to you. It's written in the first person and is the authors's thoughts as he battles his way through a fictional 100 mile one day racing classic. It was written in Dutch and translated into English, and perhaps suffers because the language is not the author's intended words. It's not exacting exciting prose, nor drama. I ride a lot and I admit that while the book was interesting as a creative writing exercise (and a novel idea), that reading ""It's not about the Bike"" was far more interesting. If you have already read the latter, then try Samuel Abt."
4,a good read,"It's good to be able to distract yourself from the grinding mill of life by reading about your main distraction: cycling. The protagonist is a racer, engaged in a race, with flashbacks to other points in his racing career, and commentary on road race culture. No need to be a racer to understand what ""the rider"" is talking about, so get a copy and enjoy the reading. You can read it in small spurts or large chunks, depending on your time and preferences. It is a good read, and worth your time and money."
2,Not Very Compelling,"Gary's put out more than his share of live albums, and they range from stellar to stupid. This one isn't his worst (the thankfully-out-of-print SKIN MECHANIC takes that prize) but it's awfully uninteresting. Once again, Gary's on vocals alone, which seems to keep him from getting too much into the performance. At least he doesn't forget the words much this time, but that's hardly praise, now, is it? The backing musicians are decent, the song selection is a bit obvious... Recommended for completists only."
5,Wonderful!,"Paper Mage is a meticulously researched historical fantasy that breathes life into an alien culture, an alien time, and retains a sense of heart. It's also well written and fast moving, despite the unusual structure. I liked the structure a lot (it is like Le Guin's The Dispossed): chapters alternate between the adult Xiao Yen who is an adept mage but who has lost her luck, and the child Xiao Yen who is lucky and studying in a school for would-be paper mages. The character conflicts and character growth reflect Chinese rather than western values, centering on things like luck and family, which is a refreshing change from most fantasy. It's kind of like Amy Tan meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon -- a breath of fresh air to US fantasy fiction. I loved it!"
3,Okay,"I love Sherrilyn Kenyon novels, that was why I bought this anthology. ""Bad to the Bone"" was okay, but not Ms. Kenyon's usual. I personally thought ""Let's Talk About Sex"" was a much more interesting story about a rather unlucky woman and a cop."
2,Just sexy... or maybe not,"The three stories are alike. The writers tried to mix a sexy story into a thriller or maybe a thriller into a sexy story. The problem was that the thrilling part of each story won't thrill you and you'd get nothing of the sexy part of each story. So if you want to read this book just for the fun of it is ok, but don't expect much of the reading."
1,Outrageous cost for 100 filters,"These same Bunn filters sell for around $2.00 for a box of 100 in several stores. The idea of charging $15.98 for a single box and offering free shipping is ridiculous. The product itself is absolutely wonderful, no arguement there. But shame on Amazon for the extreme overpricing of this item. I'm very surprised. I have no other complaints with them other than this. Maybe it's a mistake, but I just talked to a customer rep who said the price was this high because of the free shipping.That's just not right."
2,Way Too Expensive,I wasn't paying attention to the price and paid way toooo much for these coffee filters. They are hard to find in my area so I thought buying from Amazon was a good choice. I paid 15 bucks for two boxes including delivery. I later saw them for 2 bucks at a local retailer. So I paid ten dollars too much and this was totally my fault. This was not the fault of Amazon. I should have been more careful.
4,Before you buy them from here...,"The product is good. I have no complaints there. The filters are even compostable, which alleviated my only concern.What I recommend, unless you're a shut-in or live smack in the middle of nowhere, is checking around at some stores in your area. Recently, while at a giant home store that rhymes with ""Schlowe's,"" I saw that they had this exact same product, same count, everything, for about $2.50-$3. Regardless of the seller, with shipping you're looking at paying at least twice that here. Just a suggestion."
3,"It is my fault, but the wording led me astray","This product is for home coffee makers by Bunn. The product works well. This item was advertised as a filter for commercial use. I made the mistake of believing that my commercial coffee maker by Bunn would use these commercial filters. Word to the wise: even if the filter is advertised as commercial, make sure that you are getting the right size for the maker you are using. It is best to rely on the physical measurements and not on the words used in the description."
4,For the Bunn they work great..however,"They appear to be taller and a bit more sturdy. That is all. I use the Bunn 10 cup home model. Great machine/coffee. They are not only difficult to find but Amazon has it for too much. I was buying them at Walmart (hate going there) for - 1.19. Now it appears they may be discontinue carrying them. At least at the Walmart near my home. Lowes (home improvement) has them for 2.26 in the store. Bunn has it at their on line store. 10.+ for 1,000...but 7+ for shipping. **** 4 star because Bunn makes it difficult to purchase.Update... on July 7 I purchased 3 boxes at Walmart (cary, NC) for 97 cents each. Hello Amazon!Jan. 16, 20121_49 in BestBuy.... order online and pu in store"
3,Finding Filters is definitely a problem,"Similar to other reviews, I have had trouble finding filters. I also own a Krups Mocha Brew and they use a Size 1 round filter which is only avaiable online for $5/ box of 100 plus shipping and handling. This is a lousy way for Krups to do business, not making filters widely available. It would deter me from future purchases."
3,Summy,Taxes are to high is Maryland so now live where ther are NO state taxes. I don't like have to have a number of words to write so you are just getten words to fill u space.
2,Annoying filters!,"These filters are required for the Krups crystal arome coffee makers. I have to change mine (a light indicates so) every other month or so. They are very expensive, and annoying! But thanks to amazon.com now i can get them on line."
3,Cup is NOT user friendly,"The coffee pot itself is great!! Brews very quickly and is just enough for my household because I am the only coffee drinker. I do NOT like the cup!!!The cup has a bulky feel and a handle that is not suitable for most cupholders. The worst part is that there is no way to close the lid like on most portable coffee mugs. I have had three spills (on clothes) in the last 10 days thanks to my new coffee cup. I have tried using other cups to brew which causes spills and then tried pouring the coffee into my nice travel mug that closes, but this also caused a huge spill.The coffee maker is great, but the mug makes it frustrating and messy."
3,Works Best for Hot Water Only,"Works GREAT for hot water.Not so ""hot"" for coffee.I LOVE MINE for just plain old hot water in a hurry.Not so much for coffee.Just not designed correctly and the filter is the problem.Thankfully I only need mine for HOT WATER in a hurry and that was the point of buying it.I prefer a ""normal"" coffee maker for my coffee and have a great little 3-4 cup maker I received as a gift many, many years ago.If HOT WATER is all that you WANT and need it in a HURRY, this IS YOUR item.If HOT COFFEE is all that you WANT and need it in a HURRY, get a small 2-4 cup COFFEE MAKER.That's about it."
1,Burned Up in Minutes!,"I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She plugged it in, filled it with water and, in a couple of minutes, acrid smoke started pouring out of the unit and then it completely died."
5,Can't go wrong for the price,"This is my second Brew 'n Go. My first one lasted for more than 16 years until the filter finally broke. I took a look at the much more expensive Kurigs but decided that I didn't want to spend an extra $100 for the machine plus the extra for the K cups. I am very happy with the new Brew 'n Go and have not had any issues with the grinds overflowing. I am the only coffee drinker in the house, so having a cost effective way to get my one cup of coffee per day for my drive into work is great. I am really happy that the cup that comes with this unit fits in my car cup holders as my old one did not."
2,Needs Coffee Filter Paper,"The reason that I brought this coffee machine was because it said that it had a permanent reusable coffee filter that came along with the machine. I was thinking that I wouldn't have to buy anymore coffee filters, but it turns out that I had to continue buying coffee filters, because little pieces of the coffee beans kept going through the filter and into my drink. I would not recommend this product."
1,failed too soon!,"I only used this Brew n Go for about 10 days and only once a day and it failed to brew, no light no coffee! I owned one years back and it was great, perhaps I got a Lemon n Go. It was so inexpensive it was hardly worth the return. I have a larger Black&Decker coffee pot that works very well but I would have really prefered the Brew N Go for the work days."
5,Quick Cup of Coffee,"Since I am the only coffee drinker in my house, I've enjoyed having a quick and convenient cup of coffee each morning without wasting the rest of the pot. The mesh filter eliminates the need for paper filters, and is healthier as well."
4,Good Coffeemaker,"I love this coffeemaker. I only drink about 2 cups of coffee per day, so this is perfect. It is also great for brewing 1 cup of tea. It is a good buy for the price."
5,Great Lil Coffee Maker,"I love Coffee...the wife doesn't. But as much as I love coffee, I can't drink an entire pot of it myself. This little baby is the perfect solution. I've used one at home for about 2 years, and just bought a second one for the office.Here's a deviation from the standard instructions that I follow and have found practical. I use a coffee filter....I know it says that you don't need one, and you don't really. But, I have found using a filter has a few advantages. 1) It eliminates the ""crumbs"" in the bottom of my mug. 2) It helps cut the bitterness. and MOST importantly... 3) It makes clean up even easier.Take your regular size coffee filter, fold it in half, then in half, then half again (into eighths basically). hold it in your fist and trim off whatever is left at the top and you've got a perfect fit! It might sound like a chore... it's not, it's now a regular in my bleary eyed morning routine."
2,Defective batch?,"I was so excited to get this. I wanted to be able to take it with me when I travel, but the one that I received was defective. Just like one of the reviews before me, the coffee maker would shut off in the middle of it's cycle, leaving half the water still in the reservoir. I had to push the button several times to finish brewing the cup. The coffee that it made was pretty good though. I'm returning it tomorrow. I'm afraid to order another one soon, maybe there is a defective batch."
1,great coffeemaker when it works,"I've been using this coffeemaker since it came out. I had one for several years when it broke, I loved it so much I told my friend about it and he wanted one too. I purchased 2 of these from Amazon and when they came in both were broken. When you plugged it in it automatically went on. I returned both of them and bought them elsewhere. After several years of use it broke again and I purchased it from Amazon. It worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped working. When you pressed the button to turn it on nothing happened. I just got off the phone with Amazon's customer service and they are sending me a shipping label to return the item. Amazon was very helpful once I explained the situation. The coffeemaker is the best out there for the price but apparently the store that it's coming from is selling damaged goods."
5,awesome to travel with,"Have to have my coffee 1st thing in the morning, so this goes with me everywhere I go, small, packs well, and just a great product!!!"
4,great coffee cup to go,Easy to make a quick mug of good coffee to go. Brews fast. Permanent coffee filter is great and saves money.
5,Perfect just for me!,"This is a great product if you need a quick cup of coffee. Easy to use, easy to clean, and it brews your coffee very fast. I prefer the metal cup one over this plastic one but, you do not need to use it. Just use one of your favorite coffee mugs as long as it fits underneath the drip. This product is also very light and compact.Common issues would be not putting enough water as some will be evaporated or left in the water reservoir. I like my coffee light so I fill my mug 3/4 full and then there's plenty of room for milk or creamer. It will take a few tries for you to get it just right for you.I have no issues with coffee grinds going through the filter. Clean up is a snap. Just rinse the filter and holder, and empty out the left behind water and leave the coffee lid open to air dry.I highly recommend! =) Enjoy."
2,Wool suit,I received the suit in a timely manner. The suit was ok for the price. I looked but never tried it on I also returned it in a timely manner . I made sure to insure it and send it priority . I have not been credited in over 3 weeks.
5,Very Nice Suit!,"This suit was so nice that when I took it in for tailoring, the tailor couldn't believe that I got such a nice suit over the internet. He asked if it was wool, checked all the tags and said to himself, ""Son of a Gun"" when he realized it was wool. Another cool thing that he noted (which is usually only found on high end suits) was that the buttons on the sleeves were real functioning ones. When I first got the suit, I had to call customer service to exchange for a different size and the person who helped me was very helpful and prompt. If you get this suit, there is a very good chance that you will look AWESOME!"
4,Good Value,"Quality is way beyond the price. As mentioned by others, the cut of the jacket is tight across the back but does not hinder dancing or other activity. Make sure you have an experienced tailor hem the pants and make alterations if needed, my 42 regular had to have the arms shortened. I would definately buy another suit from this supplier."
3,its only a mirror,"i ordered this product and it does not come with a remote control, lights or music. i think the wrong review got posted. it's just a colorful mirror with a small mirror area."
3,below average but better than nothing!,you can at least see the baby when you're driving but he's very small. and this is true only during the day because there are no lights to illuminate the child at night. i'm looking for a replacement.
3,Baby looks so small,My daughter loves looking at the colorful mirror but when I look into it from my rearview mirror - she looks 20 miles away. I would have purchased another mirror had I known this.
2,Baby too small,I installed this in a new Nissan Altima and could barely see my baby and what was going on with him. We placed this in my husband small 2 door car & could barely see him. This was a waste of money the only thing it is good for is for my baby to play with it.
4,Its a worthwhile purchase,"My husband and I love this mirror. We both have SUV's and its easy to install. We did break the strap so we bought decorative diaper pins and we used one to hang it after we broke the strap. (the strap breaking was totally our fault) Our son loves to see himself in it and even though he is going to face front soon, we are planning to keep it so that he can see himself. We can see him very clearly also. We have moved it into smaller cars as well and it still works."
2,Blade snapped off after 3 years ownership,"I just threw this can opener out today after trying to clean it off. I bought this guy about 3 years ago, and it did its job-- it opened cans okay. I just think I don't like electric can openers. I've been routinely cleaning this can opener since I bought it, and it was just nasty everytime and impossible to get all the way clean. Sometimes you really gotta stuff that can into the blade to get it to cut into the can, too. All in all, it was just a yucky opener, and finally after giving it its weekly ""wipedown"" with some cleaning products, the plastic piece that holds the blade simply snapped off. I hate having to throw it away, but I'm glad I'm rid of the thing. I'm going back to manual. Sure, it takes more time, but they are at least cleaner."
5,FRANKLIN,GREAT MESSAGES IN THESE VIDEO'S. THANKS FOR MAKING PRODUCTS LIKE THESE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. LOVE THESE EPISODES
4,Chinese Portraits,This book is all pictures of children in orphanages and epitomizes the images of the children we saw when we went to get our daughter from China....They are so beautiful without even saying a word...Thanks for a great product.
5,December 26 review off the mark,"The December 26 review of this book misses the point entirely, and contains some basic inaccuracies. First, the book doesn't purport to be anything other than a collection of photos. The book yields no profit for the photographer or the authors of the foreword and afterword; instead all profits go to Half the Sky Foundation to assist in its mission of enriching the lives of the children who remain in the orphanages. In general, the review is kind of a cynical little hatchet job. The photos are beautiful and evocative; the purpose is noble; the book is worth purchasing."
3,The Return of Frank James,"As uausl, the Hollywood flock rewrote history to enhance box office appeal. This was a sequel to the popular Jesse James movie, starring Tyrone Power, where the 19th century's most infamous outlaw and his brother were heralded as poor maligned and mistreated farm boys, devoted to their mother and to public good will above all else. Come on, Fellows.The Return of Frank James at least features the usual excellent acting performance by Henry Fonda. Again, the film producers played around with historical fact, pretty much from start to closing scene."
4,Great show!,I love this show! I'm glad I found it here for sale. I think it was a bit overpriced though. It should have been $20 instead of $50 but oh well.
1,Nasty burns...,"This kettle boils, blows out the spout when you pick it up, hot off the stove. It's burned my husband and made a mess of our counter (just with the hot water). It's menace...please do not buy...."
3,Breezy and sensual story,"After getting dumped one time too many, Kyra decides a makeover is in order. Armed with a copy of ""Sex Kitten 101,"" she does a complete turnaround, and captures the eye of her best friend and colleague, Michael. He does not really like the makeover, as it conjures up all kinds of thoughts he would rather keep to himself.Michael soon becomes catnip to Kyra's kitten, and the two enter into a passionate affair, always fearful that they will ruin the long-standing friendship. When an accounting error leads to the possibility of Kyra being an embezzler, it is Michael that stands up for her. Can they remain friends now that they are lovers?The husband and wife team that comprise ""Tori Carrington"" have written a breezy and sensual romp heavy on the steam (and a little light on plot) about the ramifications of altering a friendship and taking it to the next level."
4,Easily makes wonderful espresso and coffee,"I bought this machine elsewhere, without first reading the reviews here, and was startled to see so many negative marks. Although I have only owned it for about a month, it has functioned wonderfully. It makes delicious espresso -- much better than the espresso that I used to make with a bargin machine that I used to own. Further, the frother is easy to use and clean. The drip coffee is also very tasty.My only complaints are minor: I have to pull the machine out away from the wall so the lid won't hit the kitchen cabinets when I open it. Also, I wish it had a meter showing how much water was in the espresso reservoir (I just top it off before I start the machine)."
5,Don't believe everything you read!,"I am the type of buyer who reads reviews on everything before I buy it and after reading some of the reviews on this product, I was hesitant to buy. Well, I decided to give it a shot and boy am I glad I did. This product has worked flawlessly every single morning for the past month. I LOVE IT. I want to marry it. No, seriously though, how anyone can not pour coffee out of the pot without spilling it all over the place, blows my mind. These must be the same people who run a car for 20,000 miles without an oil change and then write negative reviews regarding engine noise. The espresso maker works great and as for the temperature, it burns my tongue. The unit is well made and a breeze to use. The auto timer is great and easy to set up. The only thing that is true about some of these reviews is that it doesn't brew espresso and coffee simultaneously. No big deal.Just goes to show that one needs to keep an open mind before reading online reviews.ddub"
1,krups 888-43,I am very disappointed in this product. I bought it thinking it would give me everything I want in one machine but this was not the case. The foam part never worked properly and now I just have a coffee machine which I could have bought for 1/4 of the price. I have also lost the little black ball that sits on top of the vent of the foam machine and now I can't even make any foam at all. It is all very disappointing after spending so much money. My one pleasure each day was to have specialty coffees. I am very disappointed.
1,!!! Buyer Beware !!!,"Having used this Krups product for several years, my sole complaint is its very poor design.For example, on the espresso side, the two (2) brew head gaskets (hard rubber) become loose which results in the leaking of hot water from the boiler. These gaskets ARE NOT available as replacement parts - the entire boiler assembly must be replaced. An approximately $100 repair for a few dollars parts!This is the last Krups product we will buy. We strongly recommend against Krups products."
3,good beat,nice bassy music really shows off yo' sub i like it! i would recommend this disc to any music person
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought the mounting hood and a toaster oven to go with it two years ago. The toaster oven recently went bad, so I went to get a new one. THEY DO NOT MAKE TOASTER OVENS THAT FIT THIS HOOD, AND HAVEN'T FOR THREE YEARS. I wish I had know that when I initially bought this."
5,Bunny and Me,This book has wonderful photos and the story is simple and sweet. I have a TWO year old daughter and like all two year olds she dosn't like to sit still long but when I pull this book out of my collection of over 100 children's books she climbs up on my lap and I recive her full attention. Also it is a wonderful book for first readers. My six year old supprised me when she started reading it the other night. My children ages are 9months-6Years of age and all of them seem to find something they like about the book.
1,To Dana Durant,"A channelled source did state that this information was 'partially correct'. I believe many would like to know the whole of the information, and more about Rajni. Maybe put an e-book on the internet or at least some information where we can find you easily. Thank you. (These comments refer to the 'Dear God' book)."
4,Political and Cultural Laymans View of Two Countries,"Very easy read of close up personal observations of cultural, political and business climates of two cultures from the view point of a remarkable lady from childhood to internationally acclaimed agricultural proffessional and outstanding role model.Great insight into real history and events that have shaped Paraguay over the last 100 years and a glimpse of the position of the United States durning that period. A simple but essential lesson for young people in developing strong belief systems and goal setting."
5,You'll Never Go Back to Ground Coffee,"This thing makes fresh ground coffee quickly and easy. Sure, you get a few grounds on the counter, but that is the price you pay for perfect coffee. Based on other reviews I read here before I bought, I was amazed at how QUIET this thing was. You heard me right, quiet. Why even our can opener makes more noise, I have no idea why others would complain."
5,A Skillfully Written Book!,"""It is like the seed put in the soil, the more one sows, the greater the harvest!"" This book explains that we all have to undergo challenges and obstacles on our path - it is how we deal with them and our attitudes toward them that determine whether will emerge victorious and strong, or embittered and weak. Choose courage and read this book!"
2,"Finally they fit, but...","I got a pack of Screen Protectors and tried to install the first one. After several attempts I found out how they should fit on my Jornada. I think HP, at least, should had spend some time writting a one page well done installation manual.Now that I installed the first screen protector, I used my Jornada for two weeks. What I got? an scratched screen protector. Now I feel like buying a protector for my screen protector.I used to have a Palm V protected with writeright protector stickers and I got used to them. I hope HP brings up something like this, or wait until Fellowes get to this market offering its expensive but high quality productsIf somebody find something better to protect your Jornada, please let me know"
3,"The Screen Protectors protect, but...","The greenish color of the plastic protector distorts the color from the display. Also, contrast and clarity of the text suffer quite a bit. Under certain indoor light conditions, the screen is almost unreadable until I tilted the machine more towards my face."
1,Lack of quality,"The screen protectors are green, and I assumed they should be clear. The edges were roughly cut, as though they were cut by a scissors and the person cutting couldn't cut straight. The green tint prevented me from seeing the screen through them. They were too thick. A total waste."
1,"They sent me a used library book - be careful of New Chapter Recycling, Inc.","book was fine, but i didnt order a used book and this one came stamped with public library ID and checkout information.VERY DISAPOINTED and think that what i ordered was not delivered."
5,Pleasureable Rome,This book was an ideal handbook for the time I was in Rome. It gave all the necessary information with top tourists spots to make the trip more interesting. Would certainly recommend it for anybody wanting to know everything about the City.My thanks also to Amazon for their excellent delivery service to Spain. I have used them in the passed and found their service beyond reproach. .
4,Very good book,"Has very good ""technical"" information.Lacks a bit on history and needs minor updates on buses and subway info."
5,Don't believe all the bad things you hear!,"This is without a doubt, the BEST coffee maker we have EVER owned! This fine machine has been in our kitchen for 6 months and it is great! I would recommend it to anyone who desires a great cup of coffee! We are coffee fanatics and demand a great cup of coffee in the mornings. This coffee maker makes a great pot of coffee. I have never had any problems with it leaking or with putting the pot back in it's spot. It wipes clean easily and has proven that it is a superior coffee machine! I have never had the taste of plastic in using it either. I get GREAT tasting coffee every time.Way to go Black And Decker!!!!"
1,An avid coffee consumer,I received this coffee maker as a gift from my mother. Upon using it the first time I was disappointed to see that only 4 cups of coffee made it into the pot. I found the rest of it on the counter. I have examined the maker and found that it is leaking from the bottom of the water resivour somewhere. This happens each time no matter how many cups I try and make. I cant return the maker as I have not recipt and mom lives out of state and has not kept the recipt. Tast of the coffe that I get is great. Feel this is a bad designe or I got a lemon and am stuck with it.
1,Bitter coffee,"When our old percolator died, we bought this for one reason--to make coffee. We liked the programmable timer. However, after two weeks of fiddling with the strength adjustment, changing coffee brands, changing the mix, etc., we are resigned to the fact that this thing just makes lousy, bitter-tasting coffee. Never mind that it is impossible to pour from the top half of the carafe without spilling and that the timer erratically changes it's setting. I could live with that if it weren't for the bad coffee. Buy something else. I'm shopping now."
2,Rubbed my dog the wrong way :(,"I love Mendota products, this item however did not work out for us. The orange material is great and stood up to everything my dog plows through on his daily romp. However, the edges of the fabric rubbed big sores into his chest. I ordered the medium and sized it appropriately to him, nice and tight so that is didn't have room to chafe. Poor guy had big sores on his chest for a week after one use :( My dog does have a relatively short hair coat, so maybe on a longer haired dog it wouldn't be a problem. I gave it to a friend who has a wire haired pointing griffon and she loves it, so it might have just not been the right fit for my dog."
1,Don't even thing about buying this ;),"This is our third shredder. I should say, it was our third shredder. The previous two still work but they are both strip cut and crosscut is what we want now. This shredder worked great, but I had to babysit it all the time. Don't give it more than two sheets at a time and under no circumstances should I feed it an unopened credit card offer envelope. What do you call this shredder with a credit card offer about to be shredded? A big jam :) Needless to say, this thing has given up ghost and it is time for another one. I did not read the opinions here before I bought mine, shame on me, but please don't make the same mistake we did -> save your money and move on to another product."
4,Great filters,"Bunn filters are the best! However, I was mislead by the picture, I thought I was ordering something to store the filters in - which would have been excellent for the RV and at home to keep the filters from being smashed. Look at the picture....it looks like a container with a lid. The filters I received were in the usual cardboard box. Again, the filters are great.....but, I thought I was getting something else."
5,The Best Poet Ever,"When Rumi writes there is something more there is an ever constant presence just beyond words, beyond articulation. His divine encounters come across as dreamy sermons in which he transports the reader if only for a second to his world of endless joy and sustained ecstasy. I do not belive there is any poet of this age or any other who has shared Rumis endless style. I do however see allot of similarities with the latter Jewish Mystic Martin Burber. Burbur shares Rumi's notion of what constitutes a divine encouner; being open seeing the ""beloved,"" in every aspect of human life. Further like Burber he believes in the endless power of the believer. Rumi's writings are free of any self consciousness or self loath thing each of his poems inspires a new refreshing idea of how the world is. I love Rumi's poetry and I think nothing short of, total reinterpretation of everything they know should be expected of the reader."
1,Not a good eBook edition,The Rumi text/poetry is of course lovely but I purchased this to read on my tablet and have struggled with the formatting. It has odd underlined text and is generally very poorly laid up for digital reading. I can't speak to the print edition.
3,Some illumination,"As a Persian I felt I can write some illuminating remarks here. I came to this verse from Mowlanaa Rumi in this book: ""Let the beauty of what you do be what you love"" and I looked a lot for the original poetry. It seems to be sth like this originally:Today we are drunken(=in love) like everydayDont start worrying and start playing insteadFor whom the beloved's (God's) face is prayer-nicheThere are a hundred ways of prayer. (seeing God's face in everything...Everything is one.)and Barks' translation:Today, like every other day, we wake up empty and frightened. Don't open the door to the study and begin reading. Take down amusical instrumentLet the beauty we love be what we do.There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.you see they are quite different and the traslation seems to be distorted."
1,Nothing Essential,"If you are looking for a true Rumi experience then you shouldn't read this collection of his poems, well actully it's not even his poems any longer since Coleman Barks translation has taken away what's truly essential about reading Rumi."
2,The Idiot's Guide Rumi book by explains Rumi better,"As some posters have pointed out, Barks is far from faithful to Rumi's original words. I have some literal translations from the Persian and when I compare them to Barks translations, he is way off base. Can you call something that is not rumi as rumi? Barks also gives unsatisfactory summaries of who rumi was and what he stood for. Folks, he was not some flower child with roses in his hair dancing in the night to a candle! The best (I think) overview of who rumi was and what his poetry really stands for is in this book I got 3 months ago:The Complete Idiot's Guide to Rumi MeditationsI felt like this was the first time I got a realistic picture of this great poet and spiritual master. Any books that you get that make rumi's poems out to be some new-agey feelgood gobeldy gook are not ral rumi poems."
3,The Leftmost Wing of Islam,"This is a book of poetry by one of the more important and influential people of Sufism. In it you will find most of the difficult but most interesting aspects of life expounded.Rumi has a fun way of simplifying life with entertaining stories and constantly shows an extreme love for his closest historical companions.Rumi is most kind and respectful to the figures of the Bible (particularly kings David and Solomon of the OT and Jesus of the NT). I say this with the full admission of being a Christian. It is quite obvious that this individual values humanity at the core and sees all people as God's children. We should all benefit from such an example.The only thing I found difficult was that some of the allegorical content is hard to decipher being 800 years removed from the true context. However, the translator's comments at the beginning of each section and the notes in the back of the book clarify much and help the reading immensely."
2,Don't waste your time,"In my opinion, viewing anything outside of this solar system is basically unviewable with this scope. If you want to look at Saturn, it is only a small dot with a ring around it. You really need to concentrate and have good vision to be able to see Saturn to the best extent possible with this scope. Jupiter is a ball where you also need to concentrate if you would like to see the ""Great Red Spot"" (which is hundreds of times larger than the Earth!!!). You will need tons of accesories to get the most out of this scope. Overall, don't waste your time on this scope, save your money for a better telescope."
1,HP dvd740i Internal 16X DVD Writer with LightScribe Technology,I have had nothing but trouble with this drive and its recent replacement. What a piece of junk and lousy customer service. The first one would not read DVD's. The replacement will not write CD's.The customer service has been a night mare. I was ignored and dropped on email support. The RMA was screwed up. The replacement drive was sent to the wrong person and wrong address.Where is the zero or negative rating option for this product?I won't make the same mistake with HP again!
2,good content marred by horrible attempts at humor,"The book has much information on an important subject, but its attempts to be cool and funny are just distracting rubbish. Two examples out of many -- in discussing Bill Clinton's economic record, off-hand references are made to Monica Lewinsky and Marc Rich. Bob Dole is first introduced as a Viagra salesman. What is this stuff doing in a book on public policy?The authors and the publisher should be ashamed of inserting such nonsense in an otherwise good book. I suggest skipping much of the prose and perusing the tables, or reading Kotlikoff's more scholarly work."
1,Fine analysis which assumes nothing changes,"This book completely ignores the ongoing medical revolutionJeffrey Sachs writes:""No economist has thought more clearly or spoken more resolutely about our long-term fiscal challenges than Larry Kotlikoff.""and the book description begins:""In 2030, as 77 million baby boomers hobble into old age, walkers will outnumber strollers;""Does this discription make any sense at all TWENTY FIVE years into the future?The book is worthless in forecasting the future but quite good if you ignore our medical revolution."
2,Very cheaply made.,"We have had this processor for 2 years. The plastic container started breaking within a few months and now the whole bottom is broken. It does chop cookies, bread, frozen fruit with no problems."
2,Poorly assembled,"The content of this dictionary is fine, but with use as a reference for only one semester of 2nd year Spanish, many of its pages have fallen out. They're glued along the inner edge to a thin flexible backing, and it doesn't take very many times of opening the dictionary to the same range of words before the glue gives out. One shouldn't have to be alert to losing pages as one uses a dictionary."
4,Baby Wolf not just for six year olds,"A simply lovely book that both my three year old daughter and I both enjoyed reading. Well thought out illustrations are a credit to the artist with an informative text that can be read even to a little one,without ""what does that mean,dad"" every five seconds. All in all just a nice simple book."
2,has some problems,"I received one of these as a Christmas gift a few years ago. While I prefer the thermal carafe style machines, I can't recommend this one. Like most lower end machines, the brew temperature is too low and the coffee doesn't taste right.Another problem is that the overflow is desgned to go back into the reservoir. Most people won't run into this problem. I did because I was using a #10 SwissGold filter basket in it. That particular basket is not cone shaped and the coffee needs to flow out the sides.This exacerbates another problem which is that most coffee makers aren't designed for brewing fresh coffee. There isn't much extra room under the shower head. The stale canned stuff would probably work okay but fresh ground, freshly roasted beans bloom when water first contacts them. I tried to make a strong pot with some freshly roasted beans and had huge mess on my hands. That was too much to deal with before my morning coffee."
3,"Not bad, for the price . . .","This is a good, basic thermal-carafe coffee maker. There is a gauge on the outside to show your water level, and it is easy enough to read. Our coffee stays hot in the carafe for a good 4 hours after brewing -- a great thing on days that my husband goes to work at 4:30 and I don't have my first cup until the kids are off to school at 8!One annoying thing: you cannot turn the brewing off! If you accidentally bump the start button before you get the water filled, or even (as has happened to us more than once) if you bump the start button with a plate or something on the counter you cannot make the thing stop! It has to be unplugged, or it will try to brew through a cycle. We had an older version of this coffee maker that you COULD turn off, so I guess this is an example of features slipping through the cracks in the old engineering department! Other than that, I have no complaints. It makes a good cup of coffee and you can buy it for cheap!"
1,Boring and contrived,"I hated the endless talk of the ""expert"", and the awful acting of the ""couples."""
1,"In a word, pathetic!","Extraordinarily, abysmally, even spectacularly disappointing! The video is a total, unmitigated failure. Trust me, you will learn nothing, unless you don't exactly know what sex is, and there are few such people over the age of 18. The techniques are so basic and beginner-level it's almost humorous. But having wasted time viewing this pathetic production, I'm not laughing; I feel only contempt and disgust."
2,this is not Proust,"In 'The Golden Rules' The author, a well starched midwestern stockbroker, opens his closet door on an ensemble of eclectic characters pursuing the classic dream of the archetypal American Loser. The story is well written and paced to keep you awake if not engaged. The flaw, as is often the case with first novels, is the profusion of gratuitous perversons that obscure and prevent a reader from ever connecting with the characters. Where Flannery O'conner can write a rape scene that reads like a religious experience, Ryan's muse seems to be the letters to the editor in a cheap porn magazine. While the ending is obvious the ride is well constructed and the story works. With the exception of the used car salesman who shows up once too often to be credible, it is scary to think that some of these characters really could be out there somewhere. If you can find a copy in a used bookstore on the dollar table and morality isn't an issue... there is a lot of talent in these pages."
3,Modest Book on Tactics for the Beginner or just slightly above,"BEGINNING CHESS contains a fair number of the types of positions with simple tactical themes that the ""just beyond"" the very beginning stage player should learn. Not a lot but not a bad bang for the buck! There really isn't a lot of material here (i.e. like Reinfeld's 1001 Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations or Winning Chess Traps), but it is just enough to make a satisfactory book worthy for the ""advanced beginner"". Not at the top of my list, but still a worthwhile work."
4,Good Beginner's Book,Bruce Pandolfini is a proven chess teacher and author. This book illustrates that clearly. He gives clear explanations that help the beginner to understand what is happening on the board. This book provides plenty of exercises to practice the pattern recognition of beginning tactics in action. A worthy purchase.
5,Great for making baby food!,"We bought this steamer (combined with the Kidco electronic food mill) as an alternative to theBeaba Babycook Baby Food Maker. Not only has it been great for steaming fruits and vegetables for baby food, we frequently use it to make rice too. It's great! The price was right, and it has a relatively small footprint, which is nice in our small kitchen. No complaints."
5,Great Steamer,"I have owned a number of steamers and this is by far the best steamer I've used. I have been using it for quite a few months. (It makes excellent hard boiled eggs.) I've made steamed rice and keep it in the frig. Then when I am ready to steam a meal, I put some of the rice into a pyrex cup, veggies, and shrimp in the steamer at the same time. I add fresh or dried herbs to the herb receptacle. I put butter and seasoning in a small pyrex dish on top of the steamer to melt while the food steams. In about twenty minutes I have a fine, healthy meal. That is only one of many options for using the steamer. I would highly recommend it for its versatility. A healthy way to go - and the food is delicious!"
4,Versatile Food Steamer,"The Black and Decker Divided Food Steamer is a great addition to any kitchen. You can steam two different foods at one time if you add the divider. There is also a place to add herbs to season the food as it steams. Why buy a rice steamer, when you can steam vegetables and meats, as well as rice with the same appliance? It has a built in timer, so everything turns out great."
4,Chicco: Construction Crane and Mixer,Quailty toy. Very Durable. Excellent value. My only complaint is this truck's attachment is difficult to take on and off. But I would not hesitate to give it as a gift.
3,"Switch to a Switch, and skip the Hub Bub","I bought a ds-108 Netgear Hub it performed fine, I THOUGHT, when I looked closer it was not efficient in delivering the print jobs. The tech support from NetGear is FANTASTIC... and after talking to a few folks at Verizon, and the ISP I switched to a FS-108 switch. BIG difference. Really I can't see any reason to get a hub when you can get a switch. The cost difference is minimal but the performance difference is like comparing a candle to an electric light. Switch from the hub to a ""SWITCH"" Or continuing holding a candle to the electric light."
3,Useful like a light bulb. Until it burns out,"Like most consumer electronics these hubs eventually fail in a slow painful death. I believe you can expect around 3-5 years of faithful service before these cost-effective hubs give out.I wept when the first port stopped lighting up, and only three ports remained working (2 useful for my hw, 1 uplink). But my sympathy for a long-lived product went out the window when the thing got extremely hot and then all the lights went out.:| It made a resounding thud when it hit the insides of my rubbermaid garbage can. The case is metal and extremely durable. I once used two of these as a monitor stand.The power cube is still functional, and continues to power my home-built electronic hobbies to this day.Not a bad product but I'd recommend a 100Mbps / 1Gb hub, and for slightly more money you might as well go with a wireless / wired router or WAP."
1,I wouldn't waste my money on this!,"10 base ethernet is outdated technology. I worked for my school's info-tech department for a year and Netgear hubs were notorious for breaking, we have since switched to agere and have far fewer problems."
5,Fabulous Traditional Marisa,"I was thrilled to see that Marisa had not just one cd but two available on the same day!The sound keeps you longing for more. What a treat to hear her lyrics, the beats, the music. All of it makes me anticipate stage show which is sure to thrill, as usual.Also, I was surprised to hear old instruments, like the tuba, being used in such a new way. A tuba in Brasilian music? What a treat!Piracy is a huge issue in Brasil, hence the measures taken by the record industry. Yeah yeah yeah, but what about the music?As lovely and intriguing as ever. Her voice hasn't changed one bit, even after having a child.This cd was definitely worth the wait!"
3,"pretty, but not for 4-year-olds",This book suggests it's age range is 4-years-old and up. It's a beautifully done book but my suggestion would be that it is suitable for children a little older. The mazes are a little too complex for the younger set.
3,How Far South Is South,"Beware of one small problem - according to this book, if you live south of Gainesville, Florida you are no longer in the ""South"". It only covers the Upper South through the Coastal South and, as a result, many of its recommendations are just not workable in the Tropical South (Zones 9 - 11)."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting to see WHAT these plants look like, but to my disappointment,there weren't many photos-This one will make it to the garage sale..."
5,from the author,"This is the author. Thanks so much for your candid comments. I read them for ideas on how to improve the next edition if I can ever get to it. I noticed a comment from Tampa and wanted to make you aware that there is also a Florida Gardener's Book of Lists. I grew up in Florida and teamed up with Monica Brandies, a transplant from the North to write this title. She offers a great perspective. Anyone in Central and South Florida might want to try that title instead."
1,Unreliable,I'm rating this meter so others can learn from my mistake. The wand sensor is loose. The needle on the gage just can not decide if the soil is moist or dry. I'm still sticking my finger in the soil to fiqure it out. I purchased this because I have a few really deep pots. It is doing me no good. Think again before you purchase this meter.
2,Dictionary For Very Young Beginners,"Although most chess terms are readily understandable in context, if you really need definitions, this book has them. Having gone through the book, I would think that the only players who would benefit (""improve"") from this book would be children or inexperienced beginners. And then only because virtually any study would benefit them."
5,Sophisticated Style!,"This has to be, in my opinion, one the most sophisticated Bratz doll line ever made! The colors, patterns, and textures of the clothing are just incredible. The hat box she comes with is so delicate and beautiful as well as the shopping bags she is holding. The overall style and character of this doll is very well understood - ""She's got it going on!""Everything from her hair to the nicely layed out box print is everything a Bratz fan would come to expect and love! The bonus lip gloss is an added touch of elegance along with the cute photo booklet entitled ""Paris Fun Facts"" showcasing some cool photos of Paris. There's your educational value right there!Thanks and Enjoy!(...)"
4,Excellent Source,"Dr Melanson and Mr Stevens have corroborated to produce a very informative work about the Secret Service. The history of the Service is largely unknown but in this work it has been organized and presented with clarity. This book will take the reader through the history of the Service and explores the way the Service has grown and adapted in response to tragic events such as the assassination of JFK. Additionally, the reader is given insight to the inner workings of the Service with respect to its special agents, their heroics and their tragedies.This book is very objective, it pulls no punches. If something is wrong, it is noted. I did not always agree with the opinions presented but the information is so well articulated I have to give the book its due respect. I definitely recommend this book."
1,not what I expected,"I am really unhappy with this machine. If the dough is too soft the machine will not make the gnocchi. The dough usually just jams up in the machine. If you make the dough with egg it is firm enough and it works great,but the dough with egg is to heavy so it really does not cook very well. I made some gnocchi with egg. I cooked them ten minutes in boiling salted water and they still were not cooked. They felt to the tooth like whenever you undercook regular pasta. They were terrible."
4,"Well-Written, but Atrociously Edited","This is a well-told story in a beautiful setting. The action, characters, and plot twists in this novel are everything I look for in excellent crime fiction. Unfortunately, no one bothered to edit this book.Once a chapter, there's a garbled sentence of the type ""She walking down the street."" Other sentences carelessly repeat words, such as ""A troop of ideas trooped across her mind."" Proper names are regularly mangled: MacArthur vs McArthur, Frieburg vs Freiburg, Maggie Archer vs Marion Archer. And what is a STATE police cruiser doing at a COUNTY crime scene? In a carefully edited book, it would be a clue, but in this book it's just sloppy work.These mistakes are incredibly distracting. Normally, being a careful reader enhances my pleasure in a well-written book, but I would probably liked this book more if I read it more casually. Whoever was paid to be this book's editor has robbed the author and all his readers of what should have been a first-rate book."
1,Consumer Reports was Right...This is Junk,"This so called 'Toaster Oven' has no toast darkness control. Check their own technical details section for confirmation. As such it makes a lousy toaster but an excellent way to waste money.As for the alleged slice capacity of four, I have to wonder where they got their bread. Mine fits 3 slices at best (a little overlap).This is our third Black and Decker toaster-oven and the quality has definitely gone down over the years. This one lasted less than six months before the top burners stopped working and the bottom ones began to sag! After now subscribing to Consumer Reports On-line I would recommend against any of their products."
4,Good product,Got it for a great price on Amazon $30. It was a great deal. Not had any problem with it so far.
5,Beano archives,My grandson loves it. He is amazed that I found one he had not read.Space filler (5 more words required)!!!
1,Stereotyping of Black Women,The idea that we can analyze a whole race of women accurately and parade it around as an absolute fact is ludicrous and potentially dangerous! Mr. Reynolds' doctorate or whatever degrees he may have are meaningless. Ignorant people like him prove that there are such things as educated fools!
4,SUNPAK RL-20 Readylite,"It's small and convenient. It fits well on my Olympus Digital camera and Hitachi DVD camcoder. However, 5 hrs avg. charging time will last for only 15-20 or less minutes usage. I had Phillip 30W, cost $80, lighting last for ~ 20 minutes per 3 hrs charing. I am not complaining too much as it fits my needs well."
5,an awesome addition,a GREAT book well worth the $$. Now I only have to find the OT version for the same price!
3,Missing Part from VillaWare 200 bought from Amazon,"This item arrived from Amazon without the critical gasket needed to help prevent leaks. Something that I did not realize when I purchased it on 7-22-04. No opportunity to use it last year as all my tomatoes were too juicy to make sauce. It took some doing, but I have finally ran down the company who is now supplying these gaskets and other replacement parts for the Villaware Strainer. http://www.kasbahouse.com/ Suggest caution in ordering additional screens to make positive the screens are made for this particular strainer and not for the VillaWare Victorio. Not certain but there may well be intentional obfuscation from sellers of the screens."
2,modest video gain,"As a video amplifier, this unit does provide some gain, but not 20dB. In the high gain 20dB position I got 10dB at 200MHz to 500MHz, gain was only about 5dB at 700 MHz.The Low 5dB position gave as much as 5dB at 200MHz, and drops to -4dB at 700 MHz.For me, the usage as an antenna eliminator, forget about!All in all, it does boost the High VHF and Low/Mid UHF TV bands a modest amount."
5,I'm surprised.. these are great!,"At first, I was attracted to the color.. a bright yellow, groovy green.. and then I got them. Nice, quality, great bowls.. I use them constantly for prepping.. chopped this, a few spices, liquids.. it has really made my cooking much easier, less messy and I am surprised I have actually become a much better and ""organized"" cook. I don't use them for measuring.. sorry, Mario, but there is nothing quite as nice as a 1 or 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup!"
2,Great when it works!!,"This is a great little stepper until that darn, shabby pulley cable breaks. This is my 6th, machine which just broke, so the 7th will be here tomorrow. I keep returning them as I got the lifetime warranty for $5, so I don't have to pay to get a new one. I go in, get another one, and give them the broken one. They know me in the store now.I use the machine for 35 minutes, 7 days a week.MAKE STRONGER PULLEY CABLES. HELLO!? That's all that breaks on it. You would think they would have gotten the picture by now."
2,considers Christianity a myth,"I am a born again Christian who is seeking to know the truth about Zionism. Judging from what he writes the author evidently considers all born again Christians to be ignorant and closed minded. Still I read on thinking that maybe I could learn something from this book. However, when I read "" about a thousand years before the birth of the carpenter's son who became the Christ of Christian mythology"" I had enough. I'm sorry that I bought this book because I do not care to read something from a man who has such a negative view of Christ and His followers. Yes, there may be some truth in this book but I am throwing it in the trash and will look for a source that does not hold to such a negative view of Christianity."
4,Great Buy,This soudtrack is no longer made and was able to find it in good condition at a great price on Amazon.
2,as lapels go...,wow I never thought I'd have to write a review about a lapel but this one sure needs it. I love the look of it and I love that it has all 50 stars and 13 stripes but golly it sure fails in every duty of a lapel. The back of it falls off without even pulling on it. I tried to bend it a bit but it made no difference. I ended up just bending the needle flat and that stayed for all of two days 'till it fell off and now it's gone for good. I had it for about one week.
3,"Enlighted text, dense translation","I didn't really dig this translation, finding it a bit dense; much too wordy for modern sensibilities. I especially found all the variations in the honorifics for the Buddha (Arhan, Bhagavan, Sugata) confusing. Red Pine's translation is probably very authentic and in keeping with the Sanskrit or whatever language he translated from, but reading it produced the same reaction in me as if I were trying to read the King James Bible."
4,not really qualified to judge,"this sutra's teachings are on the edge of ordinary ""understanding"".i have read and studied a few translations and all have their own author centric orientation. which you will resonate with i can't say.personally i appreciated this translation and the commentary. i am looking forward to more reading and contemplating of this extensive volume.i knocked off a star because the book amazon sent was in rugged condition when it arrived.poor packaging and shipping procedures. so the hit is against amazon not red pine."
4,Very Groovy Stuff,"I bought this album on a whim, after seeing the video for ""Lovely"" on MTV's ""AMP"" show over a year ago. I was very pleasently surprised. Very catchy beats and Luke V. knows what to do with a rythm once he starts one. The goofy tune ""Juicy Luke Vibert"" prevents me from giving this CD 5 out of 5 stars however."
4,When will we get another Plug album?,"This album is typical Luke Vibert trip-hop. When the beats slow down Vibert doesn't sound as good. His best stuff is undoubtedly the drum and bass which he did under the name of Plug. Still, this is better than his previous Wagon Christ efforts, and is pretty funny in places. It is similar to the album that he had done previously under the name 'Luke Vibert', with funny sounds and funny samples. Not his best musical effort, but lots of fun."
1,not good.,"i got this as a promo copy knowing that it was luke vibert's latest.plug is good,this stuff isn't.(unless you have a really good sense of humor."
5,neat notes,"These notes are very cool. They fit right into your wallet as promised. Be aware that the pen that fits in the pad is indeed very tiny. The wings help you hold it but if you have big hands or are unable to use small writing utensils, you might want to pass."
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS,"This book is the most boring book I have read in my life, my cousin had to do a book report on this book and he asked me to help him with it,being the nice guy I am I helped him and before I even reached the second chapter I was begging my cousin to get another book. This is basically a boring story about a mexican boy named Jose who goes out looking for his freedom whatever but finds himself lost stranded in the middle of nowhere. Im not even going to write anymore because no one else (except my cousin) would even think about reviewing this book. I recomend this book to people who like Lifetime original movies, slow paced, exagerated details, and a Disney channel storyline."
2,The Maldonado Miracle,"Maldonado lives in Mexico. His friend and himself try to get across the boarder to Mexico. While trying to get across the boarder his friend, his dog, and himself have to crawl through a small passage way to get to the other side without being caught by the guards at the boarder. After he gets pass the boarder safely, he gets back into the truck and drives to a shack and they stay they for several nights. I would not recommend this book to other for many BAD reasons. The book was very boring and I thought that everything in the book was very stupid."
1,Charger,"Out of the box it came up with message "" not compatible"" with my I phone . Changed batteries same result. Called Griffith they were very nice and promised to mail a new one. Said it is compatible w/all I Phone. We'll see."
1,LACK OF PRODUCT DETAILS=MISLEADING INFORMATION,You'll be amazed of how many people bought this product and CANNOT USE USE IT because it does not work with ipod touch or iphones.(I'd call it MISLEADING INFO)I bought 4 for my cousings and me and none of us can use them...Buyer does not provide a product # or anything that informs with which generations the charger will work. You should read a few more reviews and see for yourself...Griffin TuneJuice 2 Battery Backup for iPod (Black)
1,Clearly NOT compatible with ITouch 2G or Iphone!,I bought this thinking it would work with my ITouch and is does NOT. The manufacture's web site clearly states this as well.
1,Griffin,"Very disappointed with this item. Although it looks well made, it never actually worked to charge my iPod. I ended up throwing it away."
2,pretty bland,"Pretty bland mixture of house techno, and I had a hard time telling the different tracks apart. I usually enjoy industrial techno quite a bit, but just couldn't get into this one. The complete lack of vocals didn't help either, and I passed this one back to the used CD store from whence it came."
1,Where's all the ink going?,"This printer produces decent quality copies and prints. My complaint and why it only got 1 star from me is the amount of ink this sucker drinks. It is the thirstiest printer I have ever owned. And, for some reason it uses the color cartridges even when printing in black. Another thing I hate about it is you can't print if one of the cartridges, it has 4 by the way, is out even if you aren't using that color. I'm out of cyan right now and I can not print a document in black. I am going to be looking for a replacement printer soon as I will save money in the long run on ink."
2,Avoid this printer,"I agree with most of the reviews posted. I have had this printer for several years. I rarely need to print things, but I can tell you that I have had to purchase an inordinate number of ink cartridges. I initially bought the printer for the multiple features (copy/scan/print), but I have now put more money in the Epson execs pockets than I would like to. I'm going out today to buy another printer. Whomever the individuals were at Epson that thought this little scam of a printer would help their reputation should be fired; but I'm sure if those individuals read this post they would just exclaim, ""and yeah, we are laughing all the way to the bank."""
1,I'M STUNNED AT HOW BAD THIS ITEM IS. CAN'T BELIEVE EPSON WOULD DO THIS,"Rather than repeat what the other customers have said negatively, and I tend to agree with them, I must add that the customer support was non-existant. Within a very short period of time, the cartridges were empty, and the cost to replace each one was $12.00. I began to wonder whether some were not full to begin with. Yes, of course, color cartridges do go quickly; but, even the black cartridge wouldn't operate unless all of the others were full. This is not what I was told when I purchased this trash. Only one amazing thing it did is copy old photos, making them look unbelievable. I purchased generic cartridges from Amazon; but, either they are empty or won't operate. And, that tiny photo viewer is pitiful. I'm really angry and am now discarding this. merrilyninforesthills"
2,DISAPPOINTED WITH EPSON,"I AGREE WITH OTHERS AS TO HOW MUCH INK THIS PRINTER ACTUALLY USES. I BOUGHT IT LAST YEAR AROUND CHRISTMAS AND GOT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A DEAL. I HAD AN EPSON PRINTER BEFORE AND IT STOPPED WORKING SO I READ UP ON THEM AND GOT A NEW ONE. IT HAS MANY GREAT FEATURES OR SO I THOUGHT. I RARELY USED IT AND BEFORE I KNEW IT THE INK LEVEL SAID IT WAS LOW. I THOUGHT NO WAY, NOT ALREADY, I DIDNT EVEN PRINT MUCH OF ANYTHING. SURE ENOUGH I COULDNT USE IT UNTIL I REPLACED ALL THE INK CARTRIDGES, WHICH IS VERY COSTLY. I DIDNT DO IT AND BOUGHT A NEW COMPUTER AND WAS GIVEN A NEW HP F4210. I WAS DEBATING ON SELLING IT BUT NOW I THINK I SHOULD JUST KEEP IT SINCE IT WINDOWS VISTA COMPATABLE AND IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK BETTER THAN THE EPSON CX6000. IT IS HARDLY USED AND IT JUST SEEMS IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY BUT SO IS THE INK IF IT'S GONE THAT QUICKLY. IM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN EPSON PRINTERS SO I WILL DEFINATELY TELL OTHERS TO BEWARE.........."
1,Pretty much worthless,"As others have stated, the ink cartridges are expensive and last an unacceptable amount of time. Printing in color produces poor quality images, and even if you only print black and white text the color cartridges drain. It is impossible to print black and white only if even one of the colors is out."
1,Horrible,"I probably printed all of 3 photos and 10 text pages before the initial ink ran out.I then bought all new color cartridges.I printed a sample photo and maybe 2 pages of text.The printer then went unused for a couple of months.After that it would no longer print black.I told it to clean the cartridges and the black would print but horribly badly.When I tried to clean a second time, it told me I was out of ink.What a P.O.S.A color printer and I get 3 photo prints on full cartridges before they are gone!"
1,Please Stay Away From,"This printer prints GREAT, but that is if you want to be buying cartridges for it every other week and if you want to waste all of your time doing nozzle checks and head cleanings.I am a scrapbooker, I print out A LOT of my logos, titles and pieces and half of the time it either has a black wheel ink line, there are fading lines in my work, or one color JUST won't print.So please I am just trying to save you some money, stay away from this one:("
1,NO NO NO,"the ink cartridges haven't even lasted me a month, and now 3 colors are out!! The scan function doesn't work either.stay away from epson"
1,don't buy this printer,"Consider yourself lucky if this printer stops working in time to return it and buy another brand! More problems than I care to get into...Instead buy the HP Photosmart C5180, alittle more expensive but worth every penny."
4,Classically American,"I bought this cd after seeing Woody Allen's Manhattan. I love Rhapsody in Blue, and this collection's three recordings are diverse and excellent. An American in Paris is also well represented with two distinct and pleasant recordings. This collection loses some points because these ""historic"" recordings are available only from vynil source, and some static is in the background of some of the older recordings. As well, there is not alot of diversity in the selections. If, however, you like these songs alot, listening to different interpretations of these songs can be a facinating study of some of the greatest classical music of the modern day."
2,Funniest joke ever,"SO let's go over this. AxCx suck. But that's why their hilarious. True, Seth Putnam has no talent whatsoever, and the band themselves do nothing but bang on their instruments. AxCx though, are obviously being a parody of music themselves. A joke band, basically.ALl the songs sound the same, the music is harsh and will give you a headache, and the lyrics are some of the most offfensive ____ ever to hit a record (but it dosen't offend me). So why does this even get a score? It's hilarious. Granted, it's not worth the money, and if anything, it's the only album that isn't worth a single penny. I almost died laughing after hearing this album for the first time. It will lose appeal, so don't spend any money on this.3.0/10"
1,The Worst band of all time?,"First of all, if this cd is funny I didn't get it for two reasons.1. You can't understand one word these losers are ""singing""2. It disturbs me that bands would want to write songs about how much other bands suck, especially rancid and the clash.Parody music is ok, but this is just stupid and moronic. If this is all their musical career ever evolves too, they should consider suicide."
1,Not as Described.,"The cables DO NOT HAVE AUDIO incase you were wondering. Just RGB as Pictured. You'll have to purchase AUDIO (the Red & White cables) separately.However, unlike in the Product Picture, it has BLACK ends, not Grey.The cables themselves work pretty decently, though.I was watching Wrestling, and when Hulk Hogan came out in Red and Yellow, those 2 colors were very impressive on my TV. Before I was using these cables I didnt notice Color-Quality, but now I do.It definately makes a difference.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:I purchsed this 25' cable only 2 1/2 months ago. IT'S ALREADY COMPLETELY WORN OUT ! ! !If you're going to buy an RGB cable, DO NOT BUY this one.The slightest movement to the cable now (not the connectors, i said the CABLE itself) and i lose the signal to my TV.ABSOLUTE CRAP."
3,great,wish is listed more plants but the information that is included is excellent! great information on how to use the herbs as well.
1,This is the worst toaster ever!,"It will either burn my toast, bagel, or muffin or else not toast it enough without even moving the controls up from the lowest setting. WHat is the point of the controls? They do do something but if you increase the setting, you will set off all the smoke alarms. The only good thing was that it was CHEAP. Of course what did I expect, but how hard is it to make a toaster?!"
4,Chicken anyone?,"This is my 3rd electric skillet since I have been married (25 yrs). My skillets grew as my family grew. I still like the big skillet for when they come home for mom's fried chicken, I can't seem to fry chicken on the stove without burning it and the electric skillet is perfect for that. Anyway, my last one was scratched up which tends to happen over time but still was adequate, I just wanted a new one. I do want to mention that there is not a steam vent in the lid, I think that would have been better, it's just a solid lid (thus 4 stars). Unlike another review, I feel that this has a very durable coating, it looks like it could endure a lot b/c it is like my previous skillets as far as coating goes. They make plastic everything now as far as utensils so don't use metal!! I also use my skillet for fried potatoes, stir-fry, pancakes, pork chops and so many other things. It's a great skillet and I use it often."
5,Great Item for Working peoples dinner,"This is approx. the third deep dish electric fry pan that the wife and I have bought over the years. I had real trouble finding them until I became internet savvy.THe Large 16 inch is great (Small one is too limited for us) for frying veggys/small meats and expecially sauces like spagetti. After use, put a little water in it until your ready to wash and if your smart enough to be easy on the non stick finish (use plactic utensils) it will wash up with no fear of water.Mine lasts for three years each (at least). They are getting quite pricey though.cya"
1,Disappointed!,I had purchased a similar whistle for my kids when they were little and it sounded like a real train. I purchased this whistle for my grandson and was very disappointing. It sounds like an ordinary whistle. Would not recommend this product.
5,"Excellent book, expertly written","The culmination of years of research and writing, this extrodinary book is one of the best on Abe Lincoln. Donald does a wonderful job of helping the reader understand Lincoln's mind, and the things that guided his decision-making. For lovers of American history, this is a top read."
2,Lile a college course,"OMG, this is so detailed and slow reading that it is painful to get through.It should be a text for a graduate study program."
3,Great writing However question the conclusion,"This book is a great biography of a great life in American History. The writing is excellent. My problem with the book is the emphasis on the April 4, 1864 correspondence where Lincoln states he was controlled by events. Where Lincoln like all politicians adapted to the changed political landscape due to the cataclysmic events of the Civil War, his adaptations ennobled, emboldened and redeemed the United States and its citizens. I belive Donald wished to stress Lincoln as a practical politician over his greatness and this emphasis was to the detriment of his outstanding work. Thus other politicians such as ex-President Clinton who admire this book, but their political agility was and is self-serving and led to a coarsening of the political discussion, participation and life in the United States."
3,"More Facts, Less Heart","Am a Lincolnphile, and always enjoy reading about this incredible man. This version of his life is long on facts, and gives less of a mythical sense of who Lincoln was. Unfortunately there is no new insight into Lincoln or the people around him, but if you're new to the man, or relatively new then by all means read this book. Not what you would call inspiring, but certainly edifying."
4,great value,"great value! I have been using this program to create architectural drawing pdf's for large format printing without a hitch. The program opens in my cad printing page. The program is strait forward with out a lot of bells and whistles but allows you to set all the nessesary perameters to get a good print, or send a clear email. Opens with acrobat reader."
2,Not that great,"I have had this fryer for a little over a year now. I am now looking into puchasing another fryer, but will not purchase this one again.Pros (not that many):Self contained unitEasy to clean lift out oil bucketCons (more than there should be):Can only fry litterly a handfull of french fries at a time -- With a family of five, I have to go at least four rounds before I have enough for the whole familyHeating time for oil is long, reheating time between rounds is longDoes not have an easily removeable cleanable filterBasket is very difficult to clean if you dont have a dishwaser."
4,Only $40 direct from MFR,Only $40 direct from MFR's home page. Really works. I use with a wedge cushion when sitting on chairs for even better support.
1,The Sword of Truth Gift set,"ugugugugugugugu yuck, it was HORRIBLE! Barns&Nobles was stupid enough to buy it YUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!"
4,A good imatation,"Ok, first off, that one 12 year old kid who said these were the best books, obviously never read ""The Wheel of Time"". When you read these you think, WOT hardcore, kind of like the ECW is hardcore wrestling, same thing. This took the plots and ideas of the Wheel and gave 'em a hardcore touch. Not that it isn't well written, the dialog is just as unbelievable as most of current fantasy, a flaw most fantasy readers have grown used to. There's the Tolkien ideas, Dark Lords, magic rings or swords or trinkets, made up monsters, ect. Then there the Robert Jordan ideas, women with a ""one power"", complete calmness of mind, group of remote people who almost all follow a Super-hero leader, ect. There are a lot of good charecters in this series, ones that keep you thinking about their fates long after the books are over. Overall, it uses the same tricks other Epic Fantasies of our day, and rakes in the cash. Buy it for a good time, don't expect any new ideas, though, just a good imatation."
1,I've seen better...,"I am not very happy with these knives - I've owned 12 of them at one point and every knife's handle has cracked. This was even before I started putting them in the dishwasher. Yes, handwashing caused the handles to swell and crack open. Very sanitary."
5,The coffee pot that keeps on brewing,I have to say that this coffee maker was the best investment I have made to date. I just love it. I bought mine 12 years ago before I got married and it still brews the perfect pot of coffee. I love the brew selector. I put it on 4/5 and my coffee is perfect. When and if my coffee maker ever needs replacing I will definately be buying the same one. I have never had any problems with any part of it. I also love the pause and serve feature. I can never wait till the coffee is all made. That is another outstanding feature of this coffee maker. The time it takes to brew 12 cups is so fast. My friend has a different brand maker and it takes more than twice as long. All in all I have nothing bad to say about this coffee maker. I will buy another for sure.
3,great for small places,"I do not use it every day because the seat is uncomfortable, maybe i should have ordered a larger seat. I have to get used to the resistance after switching so quickly."
4,Making Juice is so much fun,"I really like the Juicit juicer. I bought one last year, and now I'm going to buy another one. I really like how easy it is to use and to clean up. And it comes with a pitcher, so you don't have to make a mess pouring it into a pitcher or glass. It's a great item to have if you want to make your own juice."
5,Can't believe how well this worked!,"I was unsure that counter top hot air popper would do a good job of popping corn. Several other models did not have a very high rating. Well, we've been very happy with this model. It is so easy to use. Seldom does a corn go unpopped and it tastes great - even using popcorn that was at least a year old that I found in my pantry."
4,popcorn fanatic,"this popcorn maker is the best I've had so far, I own 2 others that spray popcorn and kernels all over the floor! I have a large bowl it catches everything and this pops almost all the kernels as well as putting the popcorn entirely in the bowl! I buy standard popcorn, nothing special and I get the same results with most all of them."
5,Grade A Popper,"I had one of these that I used regularly for almost 2 years. Top notch popper. Popcorn is light and fluffy, and is completely worth the money. My popper died this weekend when my girlfriend filled the chamber up almost completely with unpopped corn (probably 10 times the amount you're supposed to use), and then ran the machine until the motor finally quit.Regardless, I'm happy to spend another $20 on a new one and I'm going to make sure she stays away from it!"
1,Started to melt!,"My old air popper was on its last leg and I really love air popped corn so, I started to research a replacement. I looked up poppers online and this one had really good reviews. I'm in Canada but I paid the extra shipping to get it. I was so excited when it arrived. I read all the instructions and began the first batch. Sure enough as the last kernals popped, I noticed the plastic cover had tiny bubbles in it, when I touched it, turned out the plastic was actually melting. Sent it back (had to pay $27 to ship it)."
2,burned out,"I had two of them in a row, both of them burned out within a year. I replaced them with a Presto Poplite hot air popper, which also burned out in about a year. I do not believe that we overloaded them, hugely disappointing."
4,Works Great,This thing works really well. Make sure you buy quality popcorn though. If you buy the cheap popcorn it is usually smaller and lighter so it will tend to blow out quite a few unpopped kernels.
2,How Could They Manage to Get This Wrong?!,"Look... The Thing makes tasty popcorn, but it's designed sooooo poorly! It used to be so easy to get a good air popper, and now they don't even know how to make them right... The kernels spew out of the chamber (unpopped) from the get go. I think it's because it doesn't spin. Our old popper growing up had a rotating chamber, so the kernels stayed put until they popped. The result was great popcorn and only like, 3 unpopped kernels per batch. This thing wastes A LOT of kernels and makes a mess in the process. I've tried many tricks to fix it but nothing really works. So sad... I miss my old popper. It finally burned out after years of daily use. We love popcorn."
4,Love It,"We love it.. My son loves watching the kernels pop.. It is fun too.. Only down fall is no switch, but I don't care, it is not a big deal plugging it in when you are ready to use and out when you are finished. Easy to clean up. Very few kernels left unpopped but that is normal for any popping method."
2,"No off-on switch, flimsy top.","I purchased this Presto 04821 Orville Redenbacher's Hot Air Popper to replace an older $9.95 Presto air popper that finally gave up the ghost after twleve years of service.I expected, for about three times the retail price, and the Presto ""Orville Redenbacher"" brand, that it would be an improved and better heavy duty popper. I was wrong. What I received was a unit that is less than half the value and quality of my old reliable, now dead, Presto air popper.It is missing an on and off switch, and the top is a light weight plastic that deforms as it heats up and spits popcorn and kernels all over the counter top, with some of the popcorn shooting into the bowl. Please read all of the reviews before you purchase. I didn't, and now have to box it up and return it."
4,return to the 80's,"Never thought it would be so hard to find a good air-popper. This one is simple and effective. Even with butter and salt it is sooooooo much healthier than microwave popcorn.This one worked so well that we junked the other style purchased at a local store, and ordered a second one for my wifes office. It has also been well recieved by folks there."
1,"Not safe, do not buy","Regardless of how it pops, this unit is not safe. The top is so thin, it gets soft when at full temperature, and gets so hot that it will burn anyone who touches it. There is no convenient way to even us a pot holder to grab a hold of it.It has no on/off switch so the only way to turn it on and off is by plugging and unplugging the unit. So you have an extremely hot unit made of soft/cheap plastic that you cannot even turn on and off without reaching around it to yank the cord out of the wall. This is a fire hazard and a lawsuit waiting to happen."
4,kernel of truth,"this is a straigthforward product that does the job and does it well. nothing wrong with it except maybe it should have an on/off switch so we wouldn't have to be plugging it in to get it popping and then pulling the plug to shut it down. suppose we want to leave it on for a econd helping? no can do. sooner or later the electric cord will come loose at either the machine or the plug end -- as did my last popper. but that is acavilling,minor complaint. a pleasure to see a device that's afrfordble, simple and efficient, as this one is."
5,Great Popper!,My family had one of these when I was growing up. I purchased this popper and it works just like I remember and makes great pop corn!
4,Great product if you don't always use NTSC.,"This VCR truly allows you to play VHS cassettes from around the world on your TV. It can also be used to record in any of those formats too. If you need to view tapes from Europe (for example), and / or send tapes there that they can view, then you should consider this product. It doesn't have a tuner, but that's no problem since you can easily connect it to another VCR. It can also be used as a direct convertor e.g. to convert a PAL camcorder feed directly onto your NTSC TV without having to record it first. By default it will auto detect the input signal type, but this can be overridden to select the input and output type. It can only play and record in short play mode. Overall I was impressed with this product."
3,Make it easier to work with by using hot glue gun...,A friend gave our children one of these as a gift. We had lots of fun watching it grow. It was easier to work with by gluing the pieces to the base with a tiny bit of glue from a hot glue gun.
4,Great Product for Popcorn Lovers,"I have had my popper for about two years now and I LOVE it. The only problems I seem to have is the difficulty of finding the concentrator refills in stores. I usually get about 5 uses out of the popper before I notice that there are more unpopped kernels and have to replace the liner. Overall, it is a very quick and easy way to make popcorn that does not require it to be dripping in oil and salt like microwave popcorn usually is."
3,"Great item, but amount of uses is not even close.","According to the manual that came with the popper, these cups last for anywhere from 12 to 24 uses. Well I beg to disagree... After trying it with a tiny bit of oil to start, the cup was lucky to last for 4 uses before just to the left of center would burn out and leave pieces of Power Cup in the popcorn. Now that I have switched to air popping, it lasts about 5 - 6 times (at the very most).I am not sure how someone can get these things to last for more then 6 times. I have tried with less then the required 1/3 cup of popcorn, with more, and with the exact amount and cannot ever get these things to last what they say they will. You can always tell when it is about to give out because one part of it will start to turn brown, then the next time you use it it will have a crack or hole in it.Yes it is cheaper then buying the boxed stuff and much healthier, but they really need to update the amt of uses per cup, because it simply isn't true."
5,Power cups for Presto Pop Corn Popper,"Product exactly as expected delivered a bit sooner than expected and price better than retail (including shipping costs), not to mention that the product is hard to find at the retail level."
5,Concentrators (8 pack),I am pleased with this purchase. This accessory was purchased as part of a gift for my sister after she came by and saw my Prosto popper.
5,I love it,This was a good buying experience and it is good to know I can buy this product online. Because they are hard to find at Walmart!
4,Great product,My husband has been using the popcorn popper for years and the power caps are hard to find in the local stores. Thank goodness you had them. I bought enough to last him for a couple of years.
4,Dressy and chic,"This shoe is a classy, strappy sling back that can be worn well for dressy occasions as well as with a nice pair of jeans and a cute shirt. I am a Nine West fan all day so... it's rather difficult for them to disappoint me. They are comfortable and the strap is adjustable."
4,Worth the price,"The shoe is very cute and at a great price. I wore these to my graduation. I was on my feet for several hours and was fine, but couldn't wait to get them off after that. Normally I wear a 9 1/2 or 10, depending on the shoe. I thought if I ordered a 9 1/2 and tightened the strap to the shortest hole that the strap wouldn't fall. Unfortunately, it did anyway. I know you can buy those things to attach to the strap to prevent slipping, but I haven't seen them in black. The slipping strap is my only complaint."
1,Straps won't stay up,These shoes were ok at first but now the straps around the back of your foot won't stay up- no matter how tight you make them. Very disappointing because they are very cute.
2,I wish they stayed on my feet!,"Super cute, and they run true to size, but they NEVER stay on my feet!!!! I made the mistake to wear them to a wedding, so I walked around with my shoes ""flip-flopping"" all night. They were a total waste...I never ever wear them."
5,Great sexy shoe,"I was a little reluctant at first to buy these because most people have said the strap falls down on these, but I have found that it actually stays on my foot well. I usually don't like silver shoes but I ordered these for a bridesmaid dress and they look amazing on my feet. I like the height - they do feel a bit higher than 2 3/4 which is fine for me. They are simple, elegant and light - in my opinion they feel okay. They're not the world's most comfortable shoe, but they are tolerable for a high heel. One thing to know, I am a size 8 and ordered an 8.5. I have relatively wide feet and had tried an 8 in a store which was too small (it pinched my toes). The 8.5 fits great though. I love this shoe!- Melissa"
2,ZIPPER IS TO LIGHT OR I WOULD GIVE IT 1 MORE STAR :[,ZIPPER IS TO LIGHT OR I WOULD GIVE IT 1 MORE STAR :[ SORRY BUT GOOD PRICE
2,not a good design,The zipper is very weak and cheap. It broke the first time I used it. When loaded up it bends and doesn't hold its shape. A good idea but not handy enough.
2,"Wonderful, until the handle cracked","I purchased this wok for my husband's Christmas present. It was lovely, we cooked two meals in it Christmas day. Nice heat transfer, beautiful on the table (but big). That night, he noticed the handle was cracked where it meets the pan. It's considerably narrower than the normal Le Creuset handle. Back it went to Williams Sonoma, where there were a few other L.C. woks with similar cracks! Phooey to you, Le Creuset.I wish I could find another glass lidded Joyce Chen wok - my old one was the best, before it was dropped one too many times."
1,This machine spells disaster... not worth the hastles...,"Being an avid cook and baker, I had wanted something that would give me more options with pasta than the electric Simac that I already own. After much anticipation, the machine came, and this was nothing more than disaster!! What a dissapointment that was.. It would not clamp firmly to the table, much less the counter.. It must be operated as well as held down all at the same time, thus the need for 4 hands.. while trying to roll out the pasta, it did nothing more than roll it up into little balls under the cutting mechanism, or shread the noodles.. This then led me to the task of cleaning. being Not made from something like stainless steel, you cannot use soap and water to wash it, and much of the dough remained stuck underneath and inside the mechanism(s). even upon letting the dough dry in the machine, it was next to impossible to brush or dig out with a tooth pick... Definately not worth the money or the time.."
4,beautiful and functional,"I like this pasta machine, I like the shape and it's easy to makemy own pasta, I can not wait to make pasta for my wifein Japan! I will see her in a few weeks......Lol"
2,Poorly Constructed,"Handle doesn't lock effectively so it's very common for the handle to come loose. The rolling portion of the machine worked great, but the cutting attachment did not turn smoothly when received and after cutting 3 sheets it locked up solid. While attempting to clean out the cutters the screw holding one end cap fell out (it had been ratting since I got it) and despite repeated attempts the cutter seized up.Fine machine for determining if you really want to make your own pasta at home as a first-timer, but not good for long-term use."
2,Not very sturdy,"My CucinaPro pasta machine broke the second time I used it. I may have used a little too much force, but I think I was not really that excessive. The knob came unfastened, and it was clear that the nut, washer, and spring inside the knob were not securely installed. In the process of getting the cap lid off, the knob was messed up a little. It was not at all clear how to reassemble and align, so in the end I threw it away. Too bad, because the first time it worked very well."
4,"Great product, better results","Obviously if you're looking at this, you already know nothing compares to homemade pasta so I'll keep it short about the product.There's not much to it which is why it's so affordable and also such a great deal. I actually was halfway through making ravioli and spring-loaded adjustment knob seized up, and then broke. I was able to finish what I needed to but immediately sat down and emailed CucinaPro (which was a Sunday). A few hours later I got a response apologizing and working with me on a resolution. Turns out that this happened a few times but they immediately sent me a new one days later and it works great.I honestly can't say enough about that. Stuff happens like this all the time regardless of the product, but it's the service like that which will keep me as a customer for life. The product is great and like I said, there's not much to it. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Save your money!,"This machine [[ASIN:B00004SPDH CucinaPro 177 Pasta Fresh Pasta Machine] is made in China, it is junk. It broke after using it the first time. It is light weight and cheaply made. Save your money and time and do not buy this machine! The worst part is that I brought it to S. America so there is no way to return it...."
1,Poorly made,"Used this once to see how well it worked and if I would like it. First time not so bad, had a little problem with the clamp. Second time not so good the rollers would not stay in position and the blade scrapers fell off. Would not recommend this product and am sending it back."
3,Easy to use,First time pasta maker here and I found it easy to use. Major problem with handle falling out while in use.
1,DO NOT ORDER MACHINE THIS THRU TARGET!!,"I have ordered this pasta machine twice from Amazon (shipped by Target), and twice they have sent me a cheap replacement - the V177 Cucina Pro. The machine they are sending is made in China instead of Italy and retails on the Villaware website for $19.99. I have seen it on Amazon for as low as $12. Because it is shipped by Target instead of Amazon, getting a refund is a pain, and I am making my second trip to the post office to return the POS today. (They made me give it 1 star, or it wouldn't have received any). I am going to reorder the Imperia thru a different retailer."
2,Christmas Gone Wrong!,"I got this as a present for my mom because she wanted to dabble in pasta making without busting the bank. Unfortunately, it takes more than two hands to work the machine, it didn't actually end up working, and there is no actual way to clean it. This is definitely a bust in my book."
1,broke the first time use,"It broke at the first time use. My dough is even soft and use the medium thickness. When I crank the handle, the kob hold the machine just broke and spring came off. will not buy this one again."
1,Rubbish!,"This game is awful. The graphics are really bad, and the character creator is way worse than WCP which came out a year ago. The online bails everyone out when the host leaves and the AI is a joke. I returned this game when someone bought me the World Poker Tour game which is cheaper and MILES better."
3,WSOP,Games good. Alittle slow paced. CPU always seem to have better hands especially the Full Boat. Overall it cant be that hard to make a poker game there is only so much you can do
4,Pre-Nirvana / Post-Hardcore punk,"Starts out kinda dull and generic, typical MRR-style 3 chord thrash (not surprising given the singer apparently had a thing going with Tim Yohannan - patron saint of punk-formula purists, R.I.P), but really picks up around the fourth track with cool rythmic variations, more interesting song structures, and FANTASTIC female-fronted vocals. It's always raw, fast, and no-frills, but there is a great deal of vocal passion (screaming, singing, and occasionally growling) and even some technical skill which really leaves it a cut above the rabble of other generic west coast thrash bands so prevelant in the late 80's and early nineties. Obvious comparisons include The Avengers and Black Flag - but if you want an equally great stand-out band from this era look to The Gits. Overall, this is a great and long overdue retrospective of a fantastic punk band that few people seem to remember."
3,"Good book, a bit heavy handed.","There are very good ideas in this book, but some of them get a little lost in the somewhat preachy way it is presented. When I filtered out the sermon, the basic premise was excellent."
2,"Thorough, not complete.","After only 29 pages I found myself constantly asking ""what is that, and when did the author define it?"". Additionally, there are enough oddly worded sentences that I am unable to follow what is being said. Perhaps I am not the intended audience for the book, but since Sulkin did not include a forward, I can't tell. I am trying to use this as an initial guide to PBX, and find it lacking enought that I am now looking for another book."
1,Bottom cracked,Cooked bacon just right.....grease leaked out everywhere due to a long crack in the bottom on the first use. Dang.
5,Works great!,"So easy to use, cooks fast, collects the grease....love it! We never have bacon go to waste anymore. We used to be too lazy to deal with cooking it and the mess....but the presto cooker makes it so easy... a great invention. (It even collects turkey bacon grease..making it even healthier!)"
4,Nuke the Bacon,"I like the vertical racks to hold the bacon out of the grease.However, thought I could get more bacon on the racks.Expected 10-12. However 6 max, 8 will overlay & is really pushing it."
5,Bacon. Quickly.,"I loved this product. I bought it. I used it. Now, I have no idea where it is. Somewhere along the way, I have misplaced it. I miss it.it does a nice job on bacon. Is it as good as a nice cast iron pan? No. Not even close. Is it better than any other microwave bacon product that I've used? Sure is. I find that not all of the pieces cook evenly. The edges cook a bit faster, but that is expected in a microwave product.If you need to do small (8-ish) batches of bacon quickly, this is what you want."
1,yuck,"bacon came out ok at best, so parts of the bacon would be crispy and some would be almost to hard to chew. the bacon also had the plasticy taste to it, tried washing 10 times."
3,Microwave bacon cooker,"I'm happy with this item, it's the first microwave bacon cooker I have owned.It take some getting used to but will cook bacon crisp without too much mess.Pork bacon works better than any other we have tried. We used it this morning."
5,Simple and Efficient. Assembles and diassembles easily.,"Cooks more evenly than flat bacon cookers, paper or glass dishes. Bacon varies from brand to brand, package to package and even slice to slice within a package so some variability is inherent in any microwave bacon cooker regardless of style or design because of the bacon, not the device or microwave.Peeking under the paper towel as the bacon nears the end of the cooking and you'll catch it just right. It certainly cooks it fast enough to watch the finish. It keeps bacon high and dry out of the melted fat."
3,"Okay, it was funny sometimes, but....","really? There were a lot of things in this book that I could have done without. For example, what was the point of the vampire girl? I think that this book would have been a lot better without all the unrealistic stuff thrown in. Also, by the end of the book, I was really just sick of crappy things happening to Hart. I mean, come on...he gets kicked out of his dorm, he gets nicknamed the Mad Pisser, he gets fired from his job, and then an entire fraternity is out to kill him. I just thought it sometimes went a little too far. I only gave it three stars because it was sometimes funny and I liked the footnotes."
1,Design Defective!!,Purchased two (2) of these steam irons. The first one lasted for four (4) weeks and failed to heat. The second one lasted almost through ONE shirt and failed. Opened the irons up and the over temperature safety device had failed in both irons. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!!!
1,Defective Main Street,"It would be a great set... if it worked properly. One button is non-operational and others don't make good contact. As the most expensive set they make, I expected it to pass better quality control. I haven't experienced problems with all the other sets (and I have them all). Maybe the bugs aren't worked out on this set. Buyer beware."
5,Woof Woof (Fantastic),"What a great product! I am a mom to a 7 month old Great Pyrenees, Jasper, and I am so happy I got these bowls for him. He eats and drinks like 2 full grown Prys.Fast service, delivery and great packaging.Thank You!"
5,jamie's kitchen,I have over 300 cookbooks and this is a welcome addition. I love his simplicity and refusal to give in to specific measurements. I think the recipes are simple and easy to use. I recommend this book to a beginner as well as an experienced chef.
4,GREAT BOOK,"DETAILS ON HOW TO SONGS, PRAYERS, & DIVINATION GOOD FOR A NEW INITIATE TO USE IN COMPLEMENT WITH A MENTOR, MY MENTOR SAID THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR BEGGINERS LIKE ME"
4,A wonderful reference for the serious astrologer,"Dane Rudhyar's book is an in depth, practical and spiritual exploration of the astrological houses. He integrates classical and modern meanings with spiritual concepts, resulting in a study that is complex and meditative. After reading this book, I had a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the houses and the placement of planets within them. For the serious astrologer, this book is a MUST HAVE. Rudyhar's prose is complex and requires a great deal of commitment from the reader. While this is a plus for the intermediate or advanced student of astrology and metaphysics, it can be a detriment to the novice. When approached from the perspective of a student, the yields are enormous. Without this type of in depth study of the houses, the natal and progressed chart lack cohesion and the interpretations lack focus and meaning. Rhudyare gives the astrology student what is missing from most books on astrology, depth and synthesis."
4,Be careful,"This ""mixed"" set of performances by Keilberth and Furtwangler sounds like a good deal. But be careful when reading the reviews: some of them are reviews of OTHER Keilberth and Furtwangler recordings of the Ring. Be sure you know what you're going to get."
1,Burnt out blender,"Bought this for a friend for her bday. It lasted through 3 batches of daquiri's and then burnt out. Her birthday was in September, so we got 3 months out of it."
2,Mediocre,The slowest setting is still too fast for a protein shake. All it does is create a bubbly foamy mess. BUT it was cheap...
4,not too bad for the pirce,"For a great deal like this, I was fairly pleased with the quality. The only downside is its plastic and slightly flimsy when the motor is running. I hold onto it just incase."
5,This is a must!!,A co-worker of mine gave me this book as I am expecting my first child this November. I read almost the whole thing cover to cover and took it with me when I went to register. It really helps you to not feel overwhelmed when shopping for a first baby! I highly recommend it!
4,"The book seems great, but watch which edition you are getting...","I ordered this book thinking I was getting the newest edition (2007). Instead I received a book that was 2 editions ago and published 5 years ago. If you simply click on New or used links at the top, you will be taken to the screen for the 7th edition (higher price). If you click on the new/used link, it takes you to the 5th edition.The book is still decent, but I feel like the sale was somewhat deceptive. The authors themselves state that they change 30-40% of the book during each edition which means that potentially 80% of the book I've received is OUT OF DATE.Bummer. And no recourse since my invoice doesn't have an edition number on it."
2,You can get the same info on the net,"The info in here is good, but if you have internet access you don't really need this book. Everyone rates things on the websites you register on, like babiesrus.com. I also found myself searching for the top picks.....the authors do a lot of pontificating."
4,Pretty Good Little Book!,"If you were a Jenny Jones fan a few years back... you will get a kick out of this book. She puts a lot of whimsical stuff to read, some of it funny. On the up side she has some delicious recipes in here as well. It is a good read and actually, some of the recipes are quite impressive. If you miss having her on TV... buy the book... you will get a little extra dose of her! I was totally happy with the purchase, it came on time and it was in great shape!"
2,Grill,"Was disappointed for it was thinner then I hoped for and the cord was really short and doesn,t want to stayplugged in very well."
5,Liddle Griddle,Just the right size for bacon for BLTs. Very handy and easy cleanup. More expensive than a larger griddle. Shipped in just a few days.
5,Wow!,"I needed something I could heat up water and wax on without using my stove all the time. I did a lot of research and ended up getting this one because of the high reviews. It came via USPS a day earlier than expected which was nice. The giddle is very simple, Two handles attach to the side and you plug in the power supply. It is adjustable from about 200 to 400 degrees instead of the generic ""high, low, off"" which is a HUGE plus for me. It feels very well built and quite solid. The actual plate heats up very fast compared to my stove. My only complaint is that the power cord is a little short and must be placed on the rear so you have to reach over the (hot) plate to adjust the temperature.For $30, I trust this a LOT more than the $15 China ones. I recommend it."
3,Just ok,"I do like it, but am disappointed in it's construction. I will reiterate what others have said, the handles keep loosening up. Also, size wise, it is just barely big enough for one. If you put egg, sausage/bacon, hash browns & muffin on there for breakfast you would have to do one person at a time.It cooks fine. Have not run into any hot spots or cold spots."
4,stupid feature,"I haven't used it yet so will go along with those that have. The STUPID feature is this: if you put the control toward you, you can read the numbers right side up but the cord is not long enough to reach an outlet. If you put the control away from you, the cord is long enough but the control knob numbers are upside down and you can't see the indicator light. Of course you can turn it sideways and look at the numbers sideways.Update Apr 15: I have now used this unit and it performs quite well, about the same as my electric frying pan. Makes a great grilled cheese sandwich. The ""non-stick"" quality seems good but, even after washing, there remained a ""footprint"" of the grilled cheese sandwich. For a single person it's a great size. Easy to handle and wash. The removeable temperature control is a definite plus. Haven't tried bacon yet."
3,"It was an interesting read, but could have more details.","I wish she would have wrote a little more about Vanity. Who was a huge influence over his musical career, she inspired lot's of his number 1 hit songs. She also wrote most of the script for Purple Rain. And unfortunatly the small information that she did provide was incorrect. For example she is NOT Hispanic (as was told in the book) or Biracial she is a Beautiful Black Woman. I don't think he has been inspired creativity since she left him! Maybe he should try to get her back?"
1,Not worth the time,"There's some good information here. However, Jones' writing is stylistically poor, making for a frustrating read (and not in a productively challenging way). Her citations (or lack thereof) are also frustrating not only in terms of the interviews (as others have mentioned), but even in her other sources. For example, she quotes bell hooks, yet the hooks texts in her bibliography do not have said quote.I could write a better book about Prince. Definitely go for the Per Nilsen book instead."
3,"Detailed, but highly inaccurate.","I read Ms. Jones book recently and found it to be full of errors. There are so many mistakes, I found myself more angry than entertained by the end of the book. Dates, names, events etc were out of place. The book give good info on the record industry as a whole, but her layout of the story of Prince's life is jumbled and confusing. Any real Prince fan would find more than a couple of errors in her attempt at a biography. She quoted Prince from when he was on the Oprah show (and quoted Oprah herself) and NEVER gave credit to the show. 25% of the book wouldn't be there if she hadn't have used Oprah's show as a base. My advice as a writer (published more than a few times) do your research and then do it again then to be sure.....do it once more."
1,cheap band,When i bought this watch i had some reservations about how the band would look. When i opened the watch it seemed cheap and much to big for the watch face. Unless you really need a band that would hold up to salt water or other very very harsh abuse I do not recommend this watch.
2,This band sucks,"If you are one of those queer punkers with pins all over you, then you will probably like this band. The guitarist sucks and the beat is horrible. Warning: You will hate this cd if you buy it."
1,spend a little more for a better mixer,"this is clearly a case of ""you get what you pay for"". for easy jobs this mixer works fine, but give it a thick batch of brownie mix or cookie dough and the motor will just die"
2,basic,its a pretty basic unit. The speeds aren't what I needed. The slow isn't very slow and makes it fairly useless for why I bought. it is a simple solid unit though
5,Great buy!,I love this little mixer. It does everything the big mixers do but much easier to work with.It has great power with a long cord. Most assuredly a great buy for your money!
1,SanDisk is subpar (Memory Stick Error),"Now unfortunatley I didnt realize the problem until afterwards, but i too have been facing the dreaded ""Memory Stick Error"" while using the stick in my brand new Sony Camera, the only solution keep on removing and inserting the stick into the camera until it works, not the best way to get the once in a lifetime photo. I would defn recommend paying the extra amount for the Sony stick."
2,Memory Stick Error,"After about 2 weeks of use I got a ""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W1. Sandisk return policy let me return it but they took 8 weeks to send me the new one. In that time i got a sony (price is dropping) and i have no problems.Be careful."
5,Just as good as Sony,"I purchased this card because the Sony brand was almost twice the price. I used it in the New Cybershot F828 and it works great. Fast write speeds, fast review, delete and transfer rate. And the best, is the video recording feature. This card captures it perfectly despite the fact that it is not a Sony. It is just like watching a video tape. The quality that this card captures is amazing. I am very pleased with this purchase and feel comfortable recommending it to all. Note that this card is NOT compatable with the older Cybershot cameras. It is good for cameras that were available after 2003. Another word of caution, you will not get the full amount of 512 megabytes from this card, because of the magic gate feature. You won't lose much and overall it is still a great investment. On the 8 megapixel setting, you will yield about 124 images on this 512mb card. Excellent deal!!! Go for it!!!"
5,"Great Product, Great Price","Product is excellent! 512 mb for $39.99 with rebate. Couldn't be happier, works great with Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-S40. Highly Recommended"
4,"Easy, quick way to learn sign language.","These flash cards are a great tool for someone who wants to teach themselves sign language. I've memorized and learned at least 100 signs in about a week. I do wish that the cards were laminated to avoid bending. And some of the signs aren't completely clear. But,they are an overall good investment."
2,Popcorn comes out unpopped and tastes stale,"The first time I used it, a bunch of kernels flew out unpopped so there was no advantage over using microwave popcorn, in that respect. The popcorn used was a good, just purchased, quality brand and yet tasted stale and chewy. The unit is cool to the touch but really puts out some heat on top so you need to beware of that too. I know it is better for you but I was not willing to sacrifice that much in taste, so I returned it."
1,Popper had a burning smell and another bad smell.,This popper had so many good reviews that I ignored the bad ones. Big mistake for me. The unit had a burning smell and it was not from burning popcorn. Plus it emitted another bad/odd smell. I let the unit warm up for a minute then put the kernels in and a good amount of the kernels blew out all over the place. What kernels did pop had to be forced out of the unit by tipping the unit forward. You shouldn't have to do this. My old West Bend air popper lasted many years til it kicked the bucket and you didn't have to force the popcorn out of the the chute. Trouble is the new West Bends are not rated very good. I'll have to keep searching. Love Amazon's return policy!!
4,Our family enjoys this popcorn popper,"My family really enjoys this popper. You have to keep an eye on it when popping because the popcorn wants to go everywhere. Also, there are always several kernals that don't pop, but the overall value is great. The popcorn is light and tasty. I would recommend it."
4,Works great!,"Works just as well as other air poppers I've used in the past; nice design, quick popping, leaves very few old maids. It is very loud, but it pops quickly, so it's over soon."
5,"Fast, Healthy Option","I make popcorn at leasat every other day and this air popper went above and beyond my expectations. Almost all kernels get popped every time and I don't have to use a single drop of oil! Loved it so much, I bought a second one for my office."
4,"Works Great, But Does Not Come In Stainless Steel","This product works just fine, but I wish it came in stainless steel [Something more attractive, classy]. Pop pop pop pop."
1,DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR COFFEE BEAN POPPING,"I bought two of these last week. They DO NOT work well for coffee bean roasting. Some of the beans turn out burnt...and this ruins the flavor of the coffee. I previously had the Toastmaster 6203 Popcorn Popper sold by Target under the Chefmate brand. Those were great! That is the machine you want because it has the chamber with the air vent slats in the lower part of the cylinder....coffee beans do not shoot out of that model, and the coffee beans can be stirred as they roast...which is good.Now for the model I'm reviewing, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW WELL IT POPS CORN, but I'm sure much better than coffee."
2,Presto Hot Air Corn Popper,"I am not a fan. Gourmet popcorn flies right out and regular popcorn tastes like styrofoam.It is extremely noisy and there is no on off switch. Get a pot, use a half a teaspoon ofolive oil and enjoy your popcorn."
5,Great popcorn maker,Works well and makes great popcorn. I have no complaints and would recommend it to anyone who hates greasy popcorn. No burned corn at all like you get from the microwave.
1,Airpopper Dud,"look what isn't flung out all over the place unpopped gets jammed up with the popped - and air popped corn doesn't even taste good, doesn't hold any flavorings, salt or otherwise- tastes like cardboard- I hated it. (I bought hand cranked old fashion stove top style popper and use it 4 to 6 times a week still nearly 3 years later.) Air popped corn is a dud"
1,A crime against man and maize!,"I can't believe they still make this atrocity from the 70s. It made dry, godawful popcorn then, and it appears that it will today. It's still just as ugly, too.This loud, hot eyesore kept grinding and grinding for the longest time before egesting the equivalent of kapok or some other packing media in lieu of tasty popcorn. Blech!"
4,It certainly works as described,This air popper works precisely as described. The butter warmer part is useless but the popper pops a bowl of popcorn about as fast as the microwave. Only had a month so I can't comment on long term reliability.
3,Hot Air Popper by Prest,"It was a great value; but, has no on/off button and must be plugged in to pop. That was a drag at our gathering as we had few electrical outlets available...otherwise was great.."
5,"Works great, like the old one my grandparents used to have!","This is a great popper. As another reviewer stated, if you tilt it back just a bit in the first few seconds you have the machine on, the hot corn will not come out at you. The popcorn is fanastic out of it, I like that I can butter/salt as much or as little as I like."
5,Use it almost daily,"This is a simple air-pop popcorn maker, and I have no complaints. We use it almost daily, and love it! It pops the corn up perfectly. Just make sure you are using fresh kernels. Stale ones won't pop up as well - not the fault of the popper."
5,WOW!,"I can't believe I waited all this time to buy this. Not only does it cost less to use regular popcorn you are not adding all the fat and who knows what else that those bags contain. If you desire the real taste of butter it even melts it for you. The only draw back I could find was getting the salt to stick, but using a small amount of butter or flavored oil solves the problem.I would purchase this over and again, needless to say, I'm sold on this air popper."
3,best air popper but still does not compare to movie theater popcorn,"This is the best air corn popper, but the popcorn still does not taste as crispy and crunchy as movie theater popcorn. It seems like microwave come to be the closest, but I am not excited about all the chemicals in there besides butter, as even that is not natural butter in many microwave popcorn bags."
1,Burned Out Motor,I used this item 3 times and on the third time there was a burning coming from the motor.I turned off the unit and then when I tried to turn it back on it would not work.Seemed to me like a cheaply built product. Amazon of course was excellent in handling thesituation. 5 stars to Amazon / No stars to the popcorn maker.
5,Worked great for 22 years,Today I lay to rest my 1990 model. I have no complaints and am ordering another right now. Fingers crossed for another 22 great years.
4,Happy with the quality,"I've always enjoyed popping popcorn in an air popper. Just as easy as a microwave but it feels more special to me. You know how they say they don't make things like they use to... well that's true, and this isn't really a complete exception to that rule, but it is fairly well made overall and well made by today's standards. I bought this to replace a 30 year old air-popper that had finally seen it's last day.While it's older brother had a metal butter tray that was near the hot-air blower, this has a plastic butter melting tray that doubles as a scoop. I'll stick with melting my butter in the microwave over the plastic, but other than that everything else seems pretty solid.Popcorn pops fast and I have many less unpopped kernels in my popcorn than I did with my old machine.One last thing that I think could be improved, there is no on-off switch, it's either plugged in or it's not. A simple toggle switch on the cord would be nice, I might put one on myself."
3,Save your money - use the microwave,"This popper is ok, but honestly, it's become another $20 piece of clutter. After purchasing this item, I found that I could put 1/4-1/2 kernels in a glass bowl - cover it loosely with a plate and put it in the microwave for the same effect. Except the microwave pops more of the kernels."
4,"Noisy, but otherwise great!",This popper does exactly what it's suppose to do. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the noise.
3,Pretty Good...,"There is not much in the way of air poppers on the market, but this had the best reviews. It works great, but if you try to make multiple bowls it will overheat. Don't worry, it's not broken but will need to sit a few hours. Besides that and the general cheapie construction is works fine."
4,Smallville,Corn pops in less time than a microwave. The plastic chute can be knocked off a little too easily. We eat a lot of popcorn in our house and we have popped at least 50 pounds of corn with this handy appliance.The measure cup for the kernels is very handy and usually only 15 to 20 kernels don't pop. We recommed a longer chute as an improvement.
4,Good popper,"Very simple to operate, only negative is that there is no on off switch. It is on as soon as you plug it in. Spitting popcorn kernels everywhere. I find it easier to load it first then plug it in. I tried loading it while it was on and popcorn went everywhere."
4,Lots of popcorn,"We LOVE that it can make so much popcorn at once and all of the kernals popped. The machine is also tall enough to put our big bowls under :-) My husband LOVES this machine. I like it too, but miss the old timey ones that melt the butter onto the popcorn as it pops. I am not as fond of pouring it onto the popcorn afterwards."
4,"Hmmm, popcorn a little stale...",I don't remember the popcorn being stale when we used these as a kid (I am 43 now). Maybe my memory doesn't serve me correct as popcorn was popcorn back then and was happy to have it! We use the high quality Orville Reddenbacher kernels and the popcorn is quite stale...the popper is fun though and our son enjoys watching the popcorn pop!
4,Great popper,Wonderful popper allows you to pop corn without oil or butter.Fast popping time .I do not use the butter melting measuring dish on top of the appliance however since it is so easy to microwave butter and afterwards I can store the popcorn popper without having to wash any part of it.
5,popcorn popper,It is fast and pops almost all the corn every time. I like that we can control how much butter we put on the popcorn. The only down side is the butter melt cup on top. It works but you can only melt a small amount at a time. We love this product!
4,For the price,"It does what it does. It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be, so shelf space might be something one might need to consider. Butter melting cup up top is conveniently located.."
4,pop goes the corn,"This product meets and exceeds my expectations. It's a simple machine that fullfills the measure of its creation. Safetywise, rudimentary common sense will suffice."
3,Needs improvement!,OK. But the unpopped corn escapes during the heating process of the unit.I find myself having to tilt the popper at an angle until the popping starts.
4,You get what you pay for.,"I havent had -serious- problems with this popper, I like how it requires no oil and it pops fast, but make sure you have a huge bowl ( I have to use a shallow stock pot..) or the kernels or popcorn fly everywhere. There is no on or off switch so the minute you plug it in it starts running and you have to yank it out of the wall to make it stop. If that doesnt bother you, then its worth twenty bucks and gets the job done."
5,Great light popcorn no mess,"I now wish I had bought one years ago, I use no oil or butter, turn it on, measure in your corn, have pot waiting and a few minutes later, huge amount of fluffy popcorn yummy plain. Unplug let rest wipe clean, done."
4,Fun for one and an issue to consider (flavoring),"Fun to use however I took off a star because:* It only makes one serving at a time and if you have a family you would have to keep making bowls for everyone for movie night.* I didn't realize that finding a buttery tasting seasoning would be so hard to find. If you like melted butter, then using the cup would be fine but I find that soggy. If anyone knows a good seasoning please comment! If you like just plain pop corn no butter, it is really fun!"
1,Buyer Beware,"When we turned this popper on for the first time, we smelled burning wires. Then poof, it was blown out....faulty wiring?...I don't know. I owned a hot air popper before, so I knew how to use one. Because we waited too long (about 2 months) to use it for the first time, I could not get a refund. I was not going to take the time and money to send it back at my expense, so the next one I'll buy at the store."
4,air popcorn popper,"I read the other reviews before purchasing this item. I think it is a good value. The only problem I had was that the top flew off the first time I used it (without butter in the top), and seemed a bit loose, so I have since weighted it down. I have not had any problems with popcorn going anywhere but into the bowl. Really fast results. I have had no leftover kernels. Air popped corn is certainly not as tasty as oil popped corn or microwave popcorn, and salt does not cling, but it is obviously healthier and has nothing to do with this machine!"
3,Fair at best,"Popcorn shoots all over, which is kind of a bothersome. However, finished popcorn is light & fluffy, ""cooked' just right. Some type of bowl should be furnished that is high so that all kernals and popcorn are caught in bowl and don't end up on floor or counter."
5,Never back to microvave popcorn again,We bought this hot air popper after not having one for 20+ years....my son tried hot air popped at an event at our synagogue and urged me to buy one. We gave away our microwave popcorn. This is so simple and so much healthier. We spray a no calorie butter spray after popped and add garlic salt and we fight over the bowl.Usually end up making 2 batches.
4,Popcorn,"I love popcorn & this is the fastest way to pop. It does shoot all over the place, but it is fast. makes decent popcorn. Still trying to find a way to contain the kernals."
1,Terrible product!!,Hate this popcorn maker! The popcorn pops out before it is popped and there is no off / on switch! Only 1/2 the popcorn you put in gets popped! Very frustrating!!
3,works ok but pop corn tast blan no flavor need to pop in oil,works ok but popcorn has no flavor has to be poped in butter old fashioned popers pop corn better tast better
3,"fast, but needs help","I needed to sharpen a drawerful of dull knives, so bought this electric sharpener because of its low price and good reviews. On the plus side, it's very fast and easy to use - almost foolproof. It does sharpen very dull knives to a usable state without much effort. The downside... The first stage takes off quite a bit of metal. The second, ""honing"", stage actually finishes sharpening the knife rather than honing it. I was glad to have this sharpener because I'd neglected my knives for so long, this machine made quick work of sharpening so many knives. However, if I ever get behind in maintaining my knives again in the future (and I probably will), I will only use the 2nd stage for sharpening and use my steel for honing."
5,Works great,"Love this sharpener. Did the paper test before and after and it definitely worked on our chef knifes. You can see where it actually grinds the knife down (in a good way). Not sure I'd use it for serrated though as the instruction booklet even says that over time serrations will go away. Yikes!Otherwise, I'm very happy to have sharp knives again."
3,Sharpens Alright,"I used this sharpener to sharpen my kitchen knives. It does a decent job, but the knives aren't nearly as sharp as the day we purchased them."
4,Decent item if you use it correctly,"I do not like sharpening my own knives so I got this electric sharpener to do the job for me. I use Mundial knives which are not cheap, so I am very careful when using this device for sharpening. It is always best to get your knives professionally sharpened but if you do not have a pricey set or a sharpening place you can trust, the Presto 08800 Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener does a good job of keeping knives sharpened. I have had no problems with it in the months I have owned it."
4,Great Knife Sharpner,Great product. Knives are sharpened very well. Love the convinence of not having to send knives out to be sharpened. Small and easy to store.
4,so far so good,"does what it says and to be honest i would not know the difference between expansive sharpeners and this one coz i have only couple of knifes and do them once in a while just like an average consumer. easy to use, my wife is off my back and it didn't cost me 100 bucks."
4,Nice to have sharp knives all the time,I am happy with the quality of this product. It took me only a few minutes to learn how to use it and it works quite well. It is great to always be able to have a nice sharp knife to use in the kitchen.
3,It's ok,Make sure you don't press too hard or the wheels will stop. It did seem to sharpen ok as advertised.
3,I found it..,I found it to be very good and works really well. I have sharpen all my knives and pocket knives and there sharp and used it twice in a yr.
3,It won't get knives razor sharp,"I was hoping for surgical sharpness but no luck. It does make knives sharp, but those of you looking to sharpen your knives to a razor's edge should look elsewhere."
3,works ok...,"My brother had another name brand sharpener and it worked much better. this will sharpen, but has the tendancy to bounce the blade around on the fine honing slot resulting is an jagged edge (only if you look really close). If you take care and time you can prevent this, but I will not put my good knives in it as they could potentially destroy my blade's edge. I only put my regular ""beat up"" knives in it and it does sharpen them considerably. Any real professional with a great set of knives will have their knives professionally sharpened anyhow."
4,One drawback,Does a good job. Only problem I've had is that it doesn't sharpen some knives all the way to the end of the blade. You are left with a small portion of unsharpened blade near the handle. This creates an unevenness on the edge.
5,Fantastic!!,"This product works wonderfully, my knives were very dull and after one sharpening they now cut paper like a razor. Sleek look on the counter top and compact enough to keep out."
2,Wrong Voltage,This appliance looks OK but the operating voltage is 120 volts AC which is no good for the UK where we have an operating voltage of 240 AC. There was no indication of the operating voltage in the advert so I wrongly assumed it to be UK compatible.
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER .....,"THIS SEEMED TO WORK ON THE FIRST KNIFE , THEN IT WENT DOWN HILL FROM THERE . OUR STAKE KNIVES WENT IN AND CAME OUT, WITH A ALMOST ROUNDED EDGE . I TRIED EVERY ANGLE WITH NO! BETTER OUT COME , BUT DULLER KNIVES THAN I STARTED WITH , MY MOST HONEST ADVICE IS TO BUY YOUR SELF A BETTER QUALITY SHARPENER , THEY ARE GUARANTIED TO WORK !"
4,Sharp again,"Very easy to use, just follow the numbers on the slots.A little loud while sharpening but that was expected."
5,This product is fabulous!,"I wasn't sure I wanted something else to sit on my countertop. But for the first time in my married life (35 years), I now have SHARP knives. They cut through tomato skins easily. When I take the knives out of the dishwasher, I just run them through the sharpener, then put them away. Now I always have sharp knives. Wonderful product, especially for the price!"
5,"Hefty, good quality, attractive and utilitarian","I needed something a little better than the sharpener on my can opener, and this fills the bill. I use my inexpensive knives with the ease characteristic of more expensive ones. For the first time I can cut cherry tomatoes without crushing them. I use this just about every day, and use a chef's steel after using this to maintain a good sharp edge.Kitchen snobs look down on electric sharpeners, but I love mine!"
5,Made my mom happy!,"Mom asked me if theres anything out there that can sharp the knives she got. I did some research and got this. Boy this thing is amazing. My mom literally dropped her jaw :O ! She is happy, i am happy and its a good buy. Any size of knives will fit in it!"
1,Ruined 2 knives,"This little so-and-so damaged and dulled the edge on two different knives in exactly the same way. This could very well be due to my inexperience using the device, but I read the instructions carefully and followed them as best I could. It seems like a lot of other people love it, so your mileage may vary - but buyer beware!"
4,For the price this product deserves 10 stars!,"Eletric knife sharpeners tend to grind knives so you must be very careful not to abuse your knife on this sharpener.You also don't want to sharpen high-end knives, for example I don't put my Japanese knives into this sharpener.However for working kitchen knives that do not cost over 30 dollars, this sharpener is excellent.I sharpened my victorinox knives, ranging from paring, utility to 10 inch chefs and all of them are extremely sharpand edges are very even.I bought this sharpener also for the chefs that work in the restaurant. Apparently, if you don't know how to properlyuse this sharpener the result will be quite different when sharpening the same knife. If you are unable to sharpen your knifewell, you probably don't understand how to use this machine or your knife's edge is too out of line to be sharpened in short time.All in all, this is a great sharpener ONLY if you know how to use it!!"
1,junk,Bottom line. Junk. I understand the grinding wheel should stop when pressed to hard. Mine stops right away with no pressure. I actually stopped it with a piece of notebook paper. The paper had a rub mark on it and did not rip up. I must have received a dud.
5,WOWSER!,"Pure, plain, and simple it works! It works really well. I busted out a drawer full of knives and had them sharpened to perfection in about 30 - 45 minutes. Knives I barely used any more because they were so dull have been re-honed to their nearly new sharpness. If you are considering purchasing a new knife set (like I was) because your knives just aren't sharp enough to get their kitchen tasks done this is a much cheaper and longer lasting option."
4,Knife Sharpener,"For a cheap electric sharpener, this is an excellent product. Would like the fine stone to be a little finer. You can get around this with a few swipes on a good very fine stone. Even put a nice edge on my cleaver. For the price hard to beat."
5,knife sharpener,the knife sharpener is a great buy for the price; it works well; bought based on other reviews including a consumer magazine; not disappointed
2,A GOOD TRY,"I sharpened a drawer-ful of kitchen knives with this unit.As used, the unit sharpens knives to a ""chisel-point"".You can get keener edges by ignoring the knife guide.You would think they'd have noticed that during product test."
4,Move over Guy Fieri,"With knives a sharp as this makes them, I'll outcook you 2 to 1. Like Julia Child used to say ""You can't do nuthin without a sharp knife""."
4,better than expected,I bought this as a gift for my father and he loves it. My mother said he hasn't stopped using it since he received it. He has been sharpening every knife in the house including some of the neighbors knives. He says it works very good and quick. Be sure to follow directions and not over-sharpen. He is very pleased with this item. I would recommend it for anyone who uses knives alot and likes a clean cut.For the price this is a very good product.
4,Presto Knife Sharpner.,"I have sharpened all of my knives without any hassle, but with bigger/heavy knives you have to pull knife very slowly and touch lightly on the grinding wheel so not to slowdown the motor speed.The grinder motor is slightly under power that's why few precautions are required and I am sure other brands may be similar.This is a good overall sharpener for the household knives and I am sure it will last for many years since no one sharpen knives everyday."
4,Yes it does work!,"For all of those bad reviews that complain about the wheels stopping, etc... you didnt read the directions. There is even a trouble shoot on that topic.. your pushing down too hard!!So far so good using this product. The knives I have sharpened are MUCH better than they were and way better than using one of those hand held models.. (you'd know if you have one).I would be very comfortable giving this as a gift!"
5,Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener,The wife is delighted with this sharpener. Goal number one thereby accomplished. She reports that knives sharpened with this sharpener are very sharp. She finds it easy to use. I noticed it was fairly quiet. The compact size means it is easy to store when not in use.
3,OK for price,Product arrived quickly and in good shape. Takes some pratice to get a feel for holding items correctly. Overall I would recommend if you remember you get what you pay for.
1,don't wate your $$,"this is a total waste. I threw out my old knife sharpener because I thought""why keep the old one??"" well. this is is a complete waste--doesn't sharp any of my Cutco knives at all. total waste of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$4."
1,Waste of money,I purchased this knife sharpener because of the great reviews and the low price. I'm thinking the reviews must be a fraud because I ruined some really nice knives using this piece of garbage. A complete waste of money at best.
1,Presto Pro Knife Sharpener,When you put any knife on the sharpener it would stop if pressed too hard.Needs a bigger motor. I would not recommend this...
3,"Promising, but....","I ordered and received this item promptly (12/23>12/24), and set out to sharpen all my VERY dull knives prior to preparing our Christmas feast the next day. The item seems sturdy, and I sharpened my first knife through the 1st stage without any problem (I could tell it was sharper already). Upon drawing it, and others, through the second (final sharpening) stage it was obvious that the spinning wheel inside was out of balance, as there was an unmistakeable quick shudder/bounce while using that stage. The knives are much sharper now, but careful inspection reveals that the edges are not smoothly sharpened, but rather ""chattered"" if you will. I will be returning this item, and hope to get lucky with the next one.12/29/10 UPDATE: Replacement unit received... SAME PROBLEM - perhaps it's a bad lot. I am returning the replacement and will be looking for another model."
4,I have seen SOOOO Many sharpeners over the last few months.,"My wife has been looking for a sharper. She wanted one of those ones those food network hosts likes. I found that one a bit cheap and I would have to buy another. I found this one on Amazon's site and found it met what she wanted. Boy, Christmas dinner was so easy to cut."
5,Electric Knife Sharpener,I was tired of walking out to the tool shed to sharpen about 7 or 8 knives every few weeks so I treated myself to a gift and I am so happy to have it sitting on the kitchen cabinet ready to use in an instant.I have arthritis in my hands so my knives have to be very sharp at all times. Highly reccommended Cutting all meats and vegetables are so easy now. You will love this knife sharpener.
5,amazing book,"This book was fun. My friends and all bought it than as we made the recipes we wrote notes inside the book all over the pages. EG. added more mushrooms, less salt etc. All of our revision were in the book than we kept switching books. We loved a lot of the recipes..."
5,112,THIS IS ONE SAD CD. BUT I LOVE IT. 112 IS MAY FAVOITE BOY BAD EVER. THIS CD KNOWS THE TRUTH. THE REASON I LIKE THEN IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW TO SPEAK THE TRUTH. ALL I CNA SAY IF U DONT HAVE THIS CD THEN U SHOULD GO AND GET IT CUS IT IS A GOOD CD TO LISTEN TO.
5,112 Did it again!!,"yeah baby. Room 112 is hot...!! My boys have done it again. They came out wit another hot...CD. You just can't stop them from makin hits. Anywhere is the bomb the video is the bomb and my baby Zane is hot and fine...!!!! Ok Room 112 has my all time favorite group 112 plus my boo Lil' Zane all 2gether on 1 song, now u know the CD is hot.Every single song out of the 19 tracks dat they have on the album is hot. I personally love them all. Hey nobody, and i mean nobody can stop 112 from being THE best male vocal group around. Zanes ~N~ 112s #1 FAN ZANESCUTIE"
4,Great artists talent shown in the CD,"it was a fantastic making CD, they shown their talent in every way, different variety of songs instead of all the slow songs like their first CD, but i still like the first CD because it just had so much impact and feelings. i think they didn't do as good in the second CD ""room 112"" but well, they shown they can do some beat and all...its all good, they still my favorite group although without the CD i expected they would had made...""your letter"" ""funny feelings"" ""only one"" ""anywhere"" are all my favorites but comparing with the first CD ""cupid"" ""i will be there"" ""only you"" and all others, i would have to pick the old CD...all the songs are just so sweet and perfect.and one point i want to make is..i don't think their official homepage is very nice...just...very ..simple..so..maybe someone want to make one for them..which will be really nice...well..peace.. 112 greatest fan westside asian"
2,Sophomore Slump,"Now I'm not trying to hate on 112, but this album is really nothing special. While songs like the overplayed ""Love Me"", ""Love You Like I Did"", and ""Your Letter"" are off the hook they cannot make up for the mediocre ""The Only One"", ""Anywhere"", ""For Awhile"", ""Whatcha Gonna Do"" and the seemingly endless Interludes. Many of the songs where poorly produced, in my opinion, using the Sugar Hill Gang's ""Eighth Wonder"" as a sample for ""Never Mind"" was a terrible choice. I can't wait for the follow up album in hopes that it will be closer to the first album."
1,Just Bad!,This album was not very good at all. And it wasn't as good as there 1st one. Not that the first one was that good but it had a few good singles. This one is so bad that they needed a Mase featured song as their 1st single. These guys need to learn what making a good album's all about from their other Rand B label mates on Bad Boy.
4,So quiet!,"I kept staring at it to make sure it was working because it operates so quietly! It sounds more like a whisper than a grinder. Love that! The only thing I don't like is the retractable cord, or how you operate it. You can pull it out, but you have to twist the top to wind it back up, and you have to work with it a bit if you pull the cord out too far. I wish it had a pull release, but that's just my preference. Overall, it works perfectly well. Easy to clean, and did I mention how quiet it is? WOW!"
4,"Works fine, use with my cappuccino maker","I bought this to work with my Mr. Coffee espresso/cappuccino maker. After I bought it I read that oval topped grinders don't grind efficiently enough. I thought about sending it back but decided to try it. It's working beautifully and still going strong after 2 months of daily use.I do notice that you have to jiggle it a little to get the consistency throughout in the grind. I simply give it a shake or two while it is grinding and all works well. I use the lid to carry the grounds over to the espresso machine.I love the retractable cord, one less thing to get in the way on the kitchen counter.I have also used this to grind a few spices."
3,messy but works,"the blades arent as sharp as the last one i had so the grind dosnt come out as fine. but it works just fine for coffee. i would suggest after grinding to turn it upside down before taking off the clear lid if you want less mess to clean up. the feature where the cord rolls into the base is cute, if unnecessary."
3,Works great!,Good little unit but little is the key word. If you are looking at grinding in quantity this one isn't for you!
4,for delicate hands -,"A size smaller than a Braun. It takes some time to get used to ,especially to the short coiled up cord.Once you get the drill it works fine, does to coffee beans exactly what is expected. Too soon to know about longevity or not.Because it is of a small caliber, it grinds just enough for 2 cups of coffee."
4,good product,"The grinder arrived in good condition and quickly. However I was given one prior to it's arrival by a family member, which I'm keeping. I've been unable to connect with the seller to get an RA# for it's return....bummer."
3,grinder,"Not a bad grinder. I use it for flax seed, but it would work for anything similar like coffee beans. This is my second one. The first one just quit. I think it was an electrical problem, but except for that it worked good, and so I got another one just like it. The chord winds up into the body of the grinder so it stores neatly."
3,on the small side,"This grinder works fine, but if you are trying to grind coffee for a 12 cup maker, it is simply too small. Ideal if you just want to grind enough for a couple of cups."
1,broke after 6-7 uses,"Unsatisfied with the product.Used rarely (once a month) for grinding very light loads, and still it stopped working after 5 months."
1,Broke After First Use,"It looked fine on the outside. Plugged it in, used it to grind some spices. I had it on for 10 seconds, it was jamming like crazy, and I kept on turning it off, fixing the jam, and then trying to grind again. It just quit on me and refused to work anymore. ONE TIME AND IT BROKE!"
1,Broke after the first month,"I was looking for a cheap coffee grinder to grind spices, herbs and seeds. This is not the one, the locking mechanism/grind button is shabbily glued on and fell off after the first month. It still works but I have to jam a screwdriver in the safety latch everytime i need to grind."
4,Works but small,This grinder works very well however you have to do it several times as the compartment is small. Maybe enough for coffee for one person. But for the price and quality it does the jobe well. I have had it several months now and have no problems with it in terms of function.
1,"No zero rating available, or I would have checked it.","This thing was a waste of time, money. The mechanism that is supposed to push down to grind fell off when I opened the box. The cord is literally 2 inches long so one would have to hold the machine in the AIR while grinding. It was laughable and insulting to consumers."
1,Absolute garbage,"Not going to spend a lot of time on this useless piece of crap, but suffice to say I could do a better job of grinding coffee by karate chopping individual beans.DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS USELESS WASTE OF NATURAL RESOURCES."
2,"Better for grinding nuts, or if you don't like coffee.","This grinder is small and cute, but if you want a strong cup of coffee, don't buy this one. It chops the coffee beans into chunks, and that's all it can do. It would probably chop up nuts to about the right size. In addition, its capacity smaller than the last small grinder I had. Not even enough for a full pot."
2,Meh,"It is what it is, but it's really hard to pull the plastic cover off after grinding without spilling coffee everywhere. It has a cheap plastic latch that gets jammed up with coffee grounds or something, you end up having to pull really hard, and it never really grinds very fine either. I'd go for more expensive and better options, in the end this one is penny wise and pound foolish and I regret going cheap."
3,"gets the job done for coffee, not everyday use","if you will be using this everyday for a full pot of coffee, i would not recommend. i only use this once a month or so. it will only make a max of 4 cups a load and even with that you will have to shake it around to make sure it isn't stuck at the bottom. The design looks nice and is easy to store with wrap cord, on use it is pretty messy to remove lid and empty. other reviews say its a better spice grinder. haven't tried that yet."
4,Good for the price,"Seems pretty good for the price. I love anything with a retractable cord now. Makes it a little easier and cleaner to store. As others have mentioned, it doesn't hold too many coffee beans. I have to make about two batches. It doesn't seem like it grinds down very good either. For the price though I would say it is pretty good. I also like the design. My mom has had a Proctor Silex coffee grinder for years so I hope this one holds up also."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this to blend my own cosmetics. The first time I used it, I felt like I kept having to put more and more ingredients in to get the color right. Finally I dumped everything out, only to realize that the majority of the powder had somehow gotten INSIDE the body of the grinder. When I shook it, powder came pouring out of the hole where the retractable cord enters the grinder. More than half of the product I used ended up inside the grinder rather than in the top where it should have stayed. I only used it once, and now it's completely useless because it's full of powder.I can't imagine that it would be quite as worthless for just grinding coffee or herbs, but my guess is that no matter what you put in it, a portion of it is going to end up inside the machine. This is by far the most disappointing purchase I've made on amazon.com so far."
2,Not great,"I used the product to grind flax seeds. It worked great for awhile, but then it became harder and harder to get the top off. Last time I tried, the plastic button that is depressed to activate the motor broke off. Into the trash and I won't buy another."
3,small,Takes 2 loads of beans to get enough for a full pot of coffee. Works good but smaller than I wanted.
3,Nice but too small,"Great design with the wound cord, but if you have a Bunn coffee maker forget it - you have to do two grinds to make a small pot. If you like weak coffee or doing things twice when you are half asleep, this is a great buy. You boys in China need to increase the size of the bowl! This is America where we like our coffee in big cups, with BIG flavor."
2,krups is krap at toast,Save your fingers and your money and if you like evenly toasted breads find something else. A loser from the people who make great coffee makers.
3,No Me Gusta,Good charachter development..awful plot.. didn't flow the way good books do.. had to read it for school and barely sludged through it.
3,Dysfunctional Family Grows Up,"While the book kept me engaged and the themes are thoroughly explored, I found it difficult to really like any of the characters."
4,great toaster but on the large side,I purchased this as a gift and they love it. It is on the large side but they needed a toaster that would accomodate thick slices and allow toasting 4 slices at once. One other factor in my purchase was the color. It seems to be more difficult to find black toasters for some reason. Probably not a good choice if storage is a problem but it works great so far (one year old now and still working) and toasts very evenly.
5,"""Pleasantly Surprised""",This was beyond my expectations.This was especially the case since this title was a DVD-R and also because so many people were getting the wrong title instead of this one.The movie was well paced and the last half hour builds to an explosive climax.I remember watching this as a child and all the frightening imagery I retained for decades was affirmed by this movie.Hopefully this title can some day be released on DVD or Blu-Ray?
1,Broken crayons,"Great sized crayons for little hands, but I am giving this product one star because half the crayons were broken in the box. Not what I was expecting to receive."
2,"Cheap Lid, Hard Cleanup","I really hated the cheap plastic lid. This model's handles don't crack and fall off like the newer stainless steel models do. It is not big enough for a family, but great for a side dish or for a couple to use. It is lighter and does not get as hot outside like the newer models. However, cleanup is awful as the lid gets cloudy with time and the interior is tough to keep clean as the stoneware is welded in. I solved the problem with Reynolds oven bags, but they are very expensive! Save your money for a model where the crock can be removed for dishwashin and the food storage in the fridge under a heavy glass lid."
4,Not a photograph,"Although I like the poster, and it will fit in well with my collection, I was disappointed with one aspect. It's not a photograph; It is acually more of a drawing. I guess I didn't really notice that until it arrived. It's framed and hanging with all of the others. It looks really good. I just wanted others to be aware that it isn't a photo."
4,Caseys review,I like the book Worth because they both have problems they need to solve. Nathaniel's problem is his leg is all mashed up and he wants it better. Worth's problem is his family died in a fire and he wants one.I especially like the event when Nathaniel and Worth warn the people at a meeting about fence cutters.
2,Worth,"The book I read was called Worth. I would give this book 2 stars. I didn't enjoy reading this book because I thought the story was poorly written, and the author didn't put enough description in what the people looked like. It was also confusing. One thing I did like about was that the author put a lot of thought, and told what the people were doing and how they felt. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12. The story was about a boy named Nate. He hurt his leg and he couldn't help his father on the farm anymore. The family had to get a orphan boy so the work would get done around the farm. This is my opinion about the book but you will have to read the story yourself to find out weather or not you like the book."
2,Pathetic editing,"This book MIGHT be good if the author didn't mention the same stories over and over. By page, 200, I had heard about Roberto Alomar's spitting incident, Steve Palermo, and Merrill's hand gestures entirely too many times. This book is by far the most choppy piece of writing I've ever read. I hope Merrill puts more effort into his umpiring than he does his spelling and grammar..."
2,Size matters,I am disappointed because the size of this product is not listed. It would be nice to know how big it actually is and if it has a lid to it.
4,Solid Book,"This book is a solid starting point for readers that haven't already read a lot on this subject. Dennett covers a wide variety of possibilities and problems encountered while projecting, and offers a good deal of basic information on the subject. Readers who are new to the subject are sure to enjoy the experience.Many of this book's projections begin in lucid dreams. I mention this because sometimes readers are suspect of this type of projections, believing them to be confused with the dream itself. In fact, many people believe them to be the same phenomenon (Stephen LaBerge, ""Lucid Dreaming""). If you are looking for strictly conscious OBE's, not originating from dreams, or perhaps with more history or explanations of how it works, I suggest William Buhlman's ""Adventures Beyond the Body."""
4,Great..,Very strong hero and heroine. Adopted half-breed Rebeka will do anything to save her brother from his so called new friends.She unknowingly plays into the hands of the bad guys. Chase is shocked to see his dead wife's face staring back at him from the end of a gun and will do whatever it takes to save her from herself. This book has some great secondary characters and evolves around how important families are. I really enjoyed the exchanges between all of the characters and look forward to Ms. Morgan's next book.
2,Cheaply Constructed,The crock pot is the perfect size for small dips and stews. However the crock pot is poorly constructed compared to other Rival crock pots. (1) The crock pot is slippery. The crock pot must be placed onto a surface with something that has grip. The feet are slippery and the crock pot will go on an excursion on the kitchen counter while stirring the contents. (2) The lid is does not fit snug at all. (3) The removable pot is also ill-fitting. Not up to snuff with other Rival products. Perhaps that is why you can purchase this item for less than $20 or $15.
2,Arrived with a flaw in pot.,Upon receipt the bottom of the pot had a flaw in the porcelain. Also the unit is made in China and with their reputation for lead in the glazing I was not able to take a chance on using it.
1,Fast Cooker - Do not leave on while at work!,"I will be returning this soon. It cannot be left on while at work or overnight.I filled it up with bbq sauce and 4 chicken breasts. 8 hours later on ""low"" the chicken was brown and black, and the sauce was boiling rapidly.Tried the same thing with ribs, but this time I checked on them. The pot was filled to the top with ribs and sauce, set to low. 4 hours later the ribs were well-done and dry. Any longer would have burned them.Frozen chicken wings and bbq sauce burned after 4 hours on ""high"".Tried leaving pot on ""low"" while at work. I filled it with frozen vegetables, 2 diced potatoes, and a chopped-up steak. Upon arriving home 10 hours later, the vegetables were fused into a brown mush that did not look like vegetables, the potatoes were brown, and the meat was black. Nothing was edible."
2,Way Too Hot,"Even on low heat, this cooks a stew in four or five hours. Then it burns. Overnight oatmeal was a real disaster. This makes it clay pot very hard to clean. It always needs to be soaked."
2,Fair spell book,Not sure what this is good for. Spells are just so so. Would not consider this my best book.
3,Not new as described...,"This product was essentially supposed to be new, though out of the original packaging. The toy was definitely used! It wasn't even cleaned up. It had some sort of food dried to part of it, as well as lots of dirt and marks on the face. Even with lots of cleaning up, it was still too ""used"" to be given as a ""new"" gift. I could not use it as the Christmas gift I had hoped for. I just gave it as a surprise instead. The toy, itself, functioned properly and didn't appear to malfunction in any way (though it did not do/say all of the things described that it would)."
3,Use caution!,"The problem I'm having is that I recently replaced my drum unit and my cartridge, and I'm definitely not getting the same print quality I enjoyed prior to the drum unit failing. In fact, the quality is downright terrible, but that probably has nothing to do with the cartridge and everything to do with the drum. Bottom line, after investing about $150 in the drum unit and the cartridge, it appears that I need a new all in one. Frankly, that sucks!"
2,Not a recommended walker...,"The walker has a few flaws. First of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal. It is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child's head. My son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker.....constantly. The seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high, it should be roomier and drop lower."
2,Home Automation for people with too much money,This book will leave you scratching your head. Do not pay too much for it and you won't be disappointed. When it gets right down to it you might as well look for a plc with o.e. software because that's what you will need. Nice discussions on electrical basics and interfacing but just not practical or user friendly.There are just too many different devices to chase down and no real guidance as to where to get them. Writers should have non-technical people read their material before they publish.
3,Need to repackage,"The general intent of the author is interesting but he blows it by writing the book based on the AB PLC which is expensive and not generally popular with Hobbyists and DIY folks.The book will certainly have a lot more appeal had it been written based on PIC's or Basic stamp microcontrollers. However, I found the chapters on RS232 interfacing very useful and am keeping it for that reason."
4,Great Kettle - had it for years,"I've had this electric kettle for several years, specifically for the use of boiling water for tea. It has very basic functions - warm or boil - just add your water to the desired measuring line marked on the inside of the unit, plug it in and wait. The construction is sturdy and well-made. I think it's a great product for what I use it for. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a light to show you that it's on or an auto-off feature. If you forget to unplug it, the unit stays hot - which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than that, I highly recommend this product."
5,A must for any music lovers collection...superb!,Just a short note to say this album is a must for any music lover. What an incredible achievement in song writing and the arrangements are stunning. Buy and enjoy...you will not be disappointed!
1,Disappointed,"I thought Monte's ""Wagoneers"" recordings and debut CD were flooring. Uptempo, killer material. The second CD started dragging a bit, but still very good. This one was a big disappointment. I like his uptempo tunes, this is filled with somber, dragging, whispered songs...I found it very wimpy sounding & depressing. Maybe someone in that frame of mind will appreciate it though...I liked his uptempo root rock tunes.I recommend his debut CD direction, it made many new fans & I heard it on the radio constantly, this CD got minimal airplay if any. Maybe that's why it's available used or on eBay for $3."
3,"Great movie, unrestored version","I can confirm that this is the unrestored version with the original, ""unfinished"" soundtrack. It also seems to be missing a bit of video scene; the part where Alexander challenges the Grand Master to combat seems to be missing, as we jump straight into the single combat scene. The subtitles are rather badly translated, as well.I hope someone is able to restore the video print a little someday, and the new soundtrack should really be put on DVD as well. I'd rate the movie 5 stars, but this copy is not so good."
1,Amateurish on China,"On the subject of China, Lester Thurow (and other readers) may do better to turn to the writings of professionals who actually know a thing or two about that vast and booming market: Peter Nolan of Cambridge University, Nicholas Lardy of Yale and Washington, Nicholas Kristof of the NY Times, Jim Rohwer of CSFB and the Economist, William Overholt of Harvard and RAND, and Gregory Chow of Princeton.All that Mr. Thurow can come up with on China in this book is misinformed preconceived notions and incorrect raw data, mixed together with some vague generalizations and essentially amateurish gibberish unbecoming a tenured professor at the august MIT."
5,It's Awesome,"The DVD is everything and more of what I expected. I for sure would recommend it to a friend. Of course I love the Gaithe'rs and with Mark Lowery thrown in, it makes it even better."
5,Gaither Vocal Band: Better Day,Better DayThis DVD is wonderful. I love the new Vocal Band. The music and songs are great. The live audience really makes it like going to see them in person.
5,Where else can you find these plays?,"This is not a collection that will appeal to the average reader, not even the average reader of drama. But if you have an interest in the Symbolist movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, this book makes an excellent starting point. Though the Symbolists get little mainstream attention today, the movement shook the stranglehold realism had on theatre at the time, and opened the floodgates for Expressionism, Absurdism, and all the various ""isms"" that have followed.Many of these plays may seem bizarre at first glance, but all are fascinating, and a few (such as Maeterlinck's ""The Intruder"" and Briusov's ""The Wayfarer"") could still hold an audience today. The translations are not always elegant, but the scholarship is sound, and honestly, where else are you going to find these plays? An excellent addition to any collection of early 20th century drama."
2,Doesn't match the sheets of same brand,"It's nice, but doesn't match the Divatex sheets. The sheets are brown and this is pink."
5,The Kid,"the kid is the best song on this record. get it just for this one song. sadness and beauty swirls about you as you listen like a sweet dream.""i'm the kid whohas this habit of dreamingsometimes gets me in trouble too.but the truth isi could no more stop dreamingthan i couldmake them all come true."""
4,Work in progress -- see the concert for a 5 star show!,"I liked this collection of somewhat eclectic tunes, but was totally blown away when I saw these three in concert in Princeton in April. It was standing room only -- very rare in McCarter Theater -- and for good reason. The pace of the songs picked up, Kaplansky, Williams and Shindell were virtuoso in their now practiced performances. They admitted to recording the album before the tour started (shudda done the focus grou[ <bg>) and have improved opon the music to such a point that it is Fly, Fly, Fly, not Cry. Cry, Cry!"
1,visual basic,dear sir i would like to have the fundemental book which is with examples like object+usage+1 example that IS for all objects if u have any book like this for VB 6.0 OR VB 5.0 let me know immeately i will buy it surely. please send me the NAME AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK AND ADDRESS WHERE I CAN GET IT FROM
2,Time and Usage Developed Failure,"I too was swayed to buy Krups. Read some of the background and felt the Engineering would be faultless. Overtime my Model 466 began to leak. Small amounts but a coffee mess and mild stain under the coffee maker. The filter (internal) seemed to be used up so I discarded it as I currently use filtered water. During the steps required to set up the coffee pot, the handle on the Carafe became strained and broke in two places. Fortunately the Carafe was empty so no injury. Apparently, over time, heat causes the handle on the Carafe to become brittle. Maybe I was asking more out of a $50.00 coffee pot than I should. It did consistently make good coffee. I used the pot several times a day."
2,Overrated,The unit makes good coffee but the features make it not worth the price. Two years after purchase I find that the water filters are no longer being made (so I can't believe they're still manufacturing it). The rounded carafe is pretty but it means that the thing has to be upended to pour - which isn't a good thing when the carafe lid had degraded and is almost in two pieces - as mine is. The markings on the main dial have also worn off.
1,Estoy de acuerdo de que este disco es una porqueria.,"No me gusta para nada este disco, siempre me ha gustado mucho el merengue y he seguido a Elvis Crespo desde sus comienzos con Grupomania, he ido a sus conciertos en el Roberto Clemente y a Bellas Artes, cuando escuche la cancion nueva ""Hora Enamorada"" en la radio y sali rapido a comprar el cd, y desde el primer momento que lo escuche me parecio una gran porqueria, fue entonces cuando dije que a lo mejor despues de varias veces de escucharlo me iba a gustar mas, y estaba en todo lo contrario, lo he oido un monton de veces y para mi sigue siendo la misma porqueria, creo que a Elvis no beneficio mucho salir de Sony, por que estoy segura que Sony no hubiera aceptado tal porqueria, como dijo el chico de abajo este disco parece mas pop que merengue. Si no has comprado el cd no botes los chavos y si lo comprastes pues ni modo."
1,Very Basic Material,"This DVD is a disappointment. Besides the fact that Eric is incredibly boring and stiff throughout this video, the materials he covers is very introductory. If you are a beginning rock guitarists, this might be helpful for you. Unfortuantley, I don't think many new guitar players today will probably discover Eric Johnson until they have been playing for a while. By the time they get an appreciation for his abilities and decide to buy this DVD, they will have probably already learned most of the content in these lessons. Also, if you want to lean how to play like Eric Johnson - what scales he uses, how he build chords, etc. - don't bother with this."
4,For lovers of literature...,"Byatt indulges her readers' fascination with literature in this novel about a woman on trial for her intellectualism and a talented (although repulsive) author whose novel is on trial for obscenity. If you love book reading, book education, book banning, book burning, and books-within-books, then this is the novel for you. Of course, this is no easy read, with literary allusions disperseded throughout and in-depth analyses of ""Lady Chatterly's Lover"" and ""Women in Love"" that seem for all the world taken from the author's doctoral thesis and fail to add much to the storyline. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable work which ultimately centers on the love of a mother for her child and our appreciation of great writing."
1,Ripped off!,"I purchased this product, loaded the toner into my machine and the only printing I got was black smudges all over the page. I emailed the company directly noting that the toner was defective and I have not heard a word back. I do not recommend purchasing anything from this company. Obviously they do not stand behind their products!"
3,HP Ink Toner,The toner cartridges were intact with one box a bit torn up. We haven't used the cartridges yet so no comment of whether they work or not. Only concern was the postage charges. We paid 81.91 U$ shipping and handling and the postage was 39.93U$. 42U$ handling is a bit steep.Edith
2,Dead after 12 months!,"Very disappointed by the quality of this product. I'm already looking to replace it. Previous long-slot toaster was a Rival which lasted many years, but they no longer make this model."
2,Breaks WAY too soon,"We've had our Krups deluxe toaster for exactly 14 months, and have used it an average of one-three times a week during that period (sometimes less). A week ago it stopped working - totally, no heat. A vivid blue light flashes out of it (will it explode?)...I was put on hold by Customer service forever (finally hung up) and have now sent two e-mails over the past five days and have received no response. I don't think any toaster that breaks with minimal use after 14 months is worth a dime. Prior to last week, we loved it."
5,The most perfect kettle,"The perfect boiler. Has been serving me tea ( also, when needed, boiled eggs, heated soup) for about 7 years, and is still in shape! Boils very quickly, the lid opens easily. Apart from tea, can be used to reheat other liquids, although you have to turn the knob to control temperature and stir liquid. Otherwise, contents may stick to bottom. Perfect travel companion, light and easy to wash.Tip: don't put it on stove: if you happen to turn on the wrong burner, will burn! Mine almost did, but I was there on time to rescue."
1,Works for a while but then leaks,I've had two of these Rival hot pots. Both worked for a couple of months and then started leaking on my counters.I wouldn't recommend them.
1,Bottom Broke after 1 Week,"It fell apart after only one week of use. The glue joint broke at the bottom of the pot. Also, it was very difficult to control the level of the heat - even when the dial was turned all the way down, it appeared to be functioning at the same level as maximum heat. I would not recommend this item."
1,Glue melts,"I bought mine to heat up water and canned goods my family mails me in Afghanistan. I've used it twice, and only placed water in it, which I did not drink.After the first use, I noticed a gluey substance on the bottom which seemed to ooze out and onto the hot plate inside. The stuff scraped off.During the second use, it started leaking. It started off as a slow drip, but as it got hotter, water began to gush out. After dumping it so my floor didn't get soaked I noticed that gluey substance was all around the rim where the water level was.As another customer has noticed, most of the good reviews are from people who have owned this for many years. I believe the quality of the product has changed. My reccomendation would be:DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM"
3,"Hot, Very Hot, and Short","I chose this product because I had purchased a couple at other times and had been very pleased with them. My disappointment with this particular model is that because it is shorter and wider than the previous Hot Pots it doesn't hold as much liquid and it heats the contents to a super hot temperature very quickly making burning oneself highly probable. It works well but I find that the taller, slimmer style is much easier to handle safely."
2,Good Product BUT do not forget to empty,"I gave this hot pot to a friend of mine and he initially loved it but then asked me to return it. It boils water quickly plus the 32 oz. capacity is not bad at all. One flaw though is that when water is left in the hot pot overnight or for a couple of hours, it's water with corrosion the next morning. The heating mechanism no doubt is not stainless but who can complain for 12 dollars? There is corrosion coming out from the heating ""plate"" but can be wiped clean from the outside or boil out all the water but then who wants to take chances with their health these days?"
2,Broke after a month,"Preface: Used in college dorm, daily. Always unplugged when done. Never let water boil out completely. Had for 1 month before it broke. Only used to boil water.Problem: The center ""heating circle"" on the inside somehow has come out, therefore letting water leak out through the slits/vent on the bottom. Weird rust-ish/orange marks have been appearing around the edges of ""heating circle."" No idea what caused this.Recommendation: invest in a more quality hot pot. Yes, it may be alright for college dorms to some degree, but completely random why it broke."
3,hot pot,"Heats up pretty fast, however I don't like that there is no off dial or switch; only low or high. I use this at work and have to always remember to unplug it before I leave for the day."
1,Not worth the price,"I purchased this model in 2009. After three days of use, the non-stick coating peeled off!!Forget this brand and go with Toastess electric kettles. Much better quality there."
4,My Hot Pot Review,"This unit is slightly difficult to wash since it has the cord attached, but other than that it is easy to use. There are not many settings or buttons to complicate matters."
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap, cheap, cheap... I searched all over looking for a decent hot pot and concluded that one does not exist. I was willing to spend a little extra for a quality hot pot, but I couldn't find one. I settled for this one, mostly because of the brand name.The so-called non-stick plate in the bottom is actually quite sticky. If I cook any kind of noodles, many of them will stick to the bottom, making clean-up a pain.The temperature setting is utterly useless. The temperature of the heating plate is not variable! It's either on or off, so the temperature setting acts like the thermostat for your furnace. Even when set to the hottest setting, my hot pot will itermittently turn on and off. So frustrating! It is not possible to continuously boil water! The water will boil for 10 seconds, then it will shut off for 5 seconds, then boil for 10 seconds...What a piece of junk. I wish I could recommend a better hot pot, but I have yet to find one and I'm losing hope..."
3,great but janky,"I and my roommate, use this more than any other kitchen item. It cooks spaghetti so fast, and you can strain it without a colander. However it does make a mess of water (I have to put a plate underneath it to catch this water) and I have often felt like it might electrocute me. IE its perfect for a poor students lifestyle."
2,Heat element erodes: Temperature settings too abrupt: Plastic interior = bad,"I wanted a plug-in pot because boiling water on the stove heats my whole kitchen. This thing works but I'd recommend getting a different model (steel preferably).There are NOT 7 heat levels. The dial makes it look like there's a continuous adjustment of the heating, but there are only two states (on and off) in my pot! As you turn the dial from one side to the other, the heating goes from hottest (always on) to periodic on/off.This not a problem if you just want to boil water, but might be bad if you're trying to cook something. I was trying to cook peas, the hot state made it boil over even if I was on a lower level.Also, the heating element discolored over time (erosion? rust?)... which means I've probably ingested some unwanted stuff. Not to mention boiling water + plastic is rumored to be bad news. So I'm not using this anymore."
3,Got my 9 dollars worth,"I bought two of these for 8.99 on amazon and generally, they are OK. I drink a lot of green tea, and by reading the description, I thought it kept your water at a desired temp/setting. It seems it keeps hot by cycling on and off, which is ok, but your water may not be the same temperature, which is important if you are making green tea. Also, I left some water in it and the next day there was a large rust stain. It easily washed off, but I didnt particularly like the idea of drinking rusty water. The high setting really boils hard, and the low setting keeps the water warm. Generally, I got my 9 dollars worth"
1,"Used to be awesome, but...","Having one through all the reviews, I'd discovered why I feel so many people have given this hot pot 5 star reviews. Most of then are years old, stemming from 2003, etc. The reviews that are more recent are from people saying that they've had their Rival pot for years.It appears that many of the design problems are in more recent models (from the past few years) - the rust, the plastic taste, the leaking....It is entirely possible that this Rival pot used to be of amazing quality and incredibly durable, but you know what they say... Some things ain't what they used to be."
4,I'm a little tea kettle short and stout,"I love my little Hot Pot from Rival. I had bought one last summer at a garage sale for a dollar up north, left it there and wanted another for down south. The bigger is better philosophy took hold of me and I purchased the Proctor Silex 1 Liter at Target. Yes, it has auto shut off, and you can see your water level and it sings to you when you are done making your tea in the morning (Just kidding about that last one). After using it for a week or so, I found I preferred my little short and stout Hot Pot. It boils water much faster, it's easier for me to grip and pour the water out as well as fill it up. I do take one star away for having a little bit of a sticky-wicket lid. Other than that, for me, it's just right."
2,not so good,"Boils water fast, no problem. No ""off"" position on dial. You have to unplug it to turn it off. For lower temperatures, it simply shuts off, rather than lowers the heater unit, so if you want to simmer, it will heat up, then cool down, then heat up again. Decent for the price but don't expect much."
2,Made very cheap.,"This hot pot doesn't heat water very fast, its plastic and water doesn't get very hot. Its a piece of junk."
3,Incredibly Fast and Useful... until it died,"Like many of the other reviewers I found my little Hot Pot Express to be amazingly useful and fast. I used it daily to make tea or coffee and I even experimented making pasta and oatmeal with it. Fantastic! That is, until it died. I was glad to hear that other reviewers had their units last for years, but sadly mine lasted just until the warranty expired. The unit simply does not heat any more. I felt terrible throwing it away (which I did). Please think twice about the expected life-time of this unit before you buy."
3,'s pretty nice,"Nifty little pot, although i'd like a clearer fill-line mark(i have to feel for it)...and maybe an on-indicator light. But it DOES heat fast, comes to full boil, not just a simmerblubble, and is easy to clean.And the price was right....although i'd pay a tad more if it also had an auto shut-off after, say, a couple of hours."
1,Hot Pot Express,"In the advertisement, it is said that we can make steamed vegetables and hard boiled eggs by way of a rack. When I received this hot pot express, there was no rack to neither steam vegetables nor make hard boiled eggs. And it is only 32 ounces. Even if it had a rack, its too small to steam vegetables and barely make one hard boiled egg. The advertisement is misleading. I sent it back about 2 weeks ago and I am still waiting for the refund from the company called,""The Nerds."""
1,Terrifying fire hazard,"I've owned this kettle less than six months, but I will be cutting the cord off and throwing it in the trash so that nobody fishes it out and tries to use it. The plate has rusted, but more worryingly, it makes horrible ""burning electronics"" smells when it's in use. Additionally, the lid is very hard to open, which is exciting in a bad way when the water inside is at full boil. Aside from those petty, petty ""life safety"" issues, the cord is too short.Save your money up a little while longer and go with a nicer kettle. This thing is dangerous garbage."
3,Nice Book,"This book covers building a dory (or rowboat), pictured on the cover. Lots of clear instructions and color photographs. I was actually looking for a book on ship modeling. The advice is very complete, and well done."
1,Pure Crap,Barbie sucks. ENd of story. LIsten to better music than this. Even kids should hate this. Listen to system of a down. I bet the 6 year olds would like that! hehe
3,Hard to clean for a spice grinder,"As people have mentioned before, this product does a good job grinding spices, but is very difficult to clean. The particles become stuck to or embedded in the plastic lid. Whatever spice you ground ends up ""contaminating"" the next spice you grind. I've read that grinding a half cup of rice will help... but why would I want to waste a half cup of rice every time I want to grind some spices???All-in-all it works ok and I'll make due until I come across something better enough to compel me to replace it."
5,Powerful.,"This little grinder is perfect for what I need it for. Coffee is a cinch. I usually measure the beans just like the ground coffee, maybe just use alittle more with the beans. Others said to turn upside down to get the coffee out. I agree. After you are done grinding just turn upside down and pulse once or so, then tap on the counter and dump into the coffee machine. The coffee is so much better tasting when you grind your own."
5,Still working after 25 years,"I have had this version of the Krups coffee grinder for 25 years. It is still working like it did when it came out of the box. I am buying one for my daughter. She will be thrilled to get the ""same"" one because the sound of the coffee grinding will be so familiar.KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel blades, Black"
5,Love it,"I've recently begun grinding my coffee and I cannot recommend it enough to have the freshest coffee every morning. I wouldn't go back in a million years! The only downside is I still haven't found a brush that isn't too pricy to clean the left over grinded coffee. Other than that, a great buy!"
2,"Grinds coffee well, but there are quality control problems with the lid","I have no qualms about the grinding capabilities of this machine. It does its job adequately. The grind is fairly even, it works pretty fast, the motor is relatively quiet, and we don't have problems with static buildup that you see in some coffee grinders.However, the lid is just slightly too big for the grinding chamber. You must push down hard on the lid to get a snug fit (which is required to run the blades). Taking the lid off is worse--you must jiggle it back and forth while pulling relatively hard. When the lid does come free, it often goes very quickly, resulting in scattered coffee grounds all over the floor. We have tried cleaning the lid and the chamber thoroughly before and after each use, and, although this helps, it does not solve the problem.I am hoping that repeated use will wear down the plastic a bit, which should make taking off and replacing the lid a tad easier."
1,"Worked well for a month and a half, then stopped abruptly.","The grinder worked every time I had used it before then all of a sudden I pulled it out one day and it just didn't function anymore. I am extremely disappointed in its longevity because I use the grinder for bodybuilding purposes (grinding oats for easy carbs). Admittedly, this is a coffee grinder and not an oat grinder, but I do not see how oats would affect its performance in such an negative fashion. I am now out of ground oats and it is going to be a hassle to find a carb replacement before class today because I rely so heavily on the oats."
4,Krups Coffee Grinder,Only had grinder for a month but seems to do a good job for the money. No way to set it for the grind you want.
4,Good performance for the Price,"I've been using the grinder for a few weeks now and it grinds in seconds and has performed well for the price. A bit messy to transfer grinds to filter, but I can work around that."
3,Only a shadow of it's former self,"I was given a Krups model 203 in 1976. It worked perfectly, every single day... until I dropped it, two weeks ago. I'm getting it repaired now.The replacement I bought, the 203-42, is not as good. The plastic is flimsier. The motor whines at a more irritating pitch, but is less powerful. The cord is shorter... inconveniently so. And the smell? Every time I use the grinder, the smell of burning rubber/plastic overwhelms the aroma of my dark roasted beans. I seriously fear a meltdown.Let me say, the grinder does grinds the coffee beans. That IS the bottom line, isn't it? But it doesn't do it as easily, as pleasantly, or as conveniently as the original model for which I so patiently wait to return from the shop."
4,"Quick, solid construction, ""Fresh Coffee""","Quick, Solid construction, and very easy to use. If want a grinder that works quickly, then this inexpensive Unit is excellent. I would rate this item a FIVE star if it were easier to clean. If you grind the beans too long, then you get a fine powder that is difficult to clean. You may have to experiment with the length of grinding your coffee beans to get the right texture for your coffee maker, but overall, this is a very good product that will serve anyone who wants a Fresh cup in the morning very well."
3,Burns coffee grounds.,"A burr coffee grinder protects the grinds from becoming burnt...I guess it's an ok little machine. Once I got to my house, though, I was wondering if our magic bullet would have done the same job. I used it for a couple days and may use it again (or for grinding other things, who knows) but I bought a capresso burr grinder and that one works MAGICALLY. this one is hard to clean. I'll hang onto it if I need it, though, as it was a wedding gift and it DOES work. It will give you a nice grind if you let it."
5,Excellent and fast,"I have only used it for coffee beans, not spices yet but it works nice. Grinders the bean smoothly and fast and isn't really loud. Looks nice too."
3,Uneven results when you don't want very fine grind.,We use ours to grind fresh coffee for the French press. Ideally for French press the grind should be somewhat coarse. To achieve that I try not to operate the machine for very long. Regardless how long I grind the beans there is always a thick layer of very fine grind stuck on the bottom of the grinder. We don't mind the grind in the coffee very much but I have to say this doesn't work as well as the Cuisinart we used to have.
5,Husband loves it!,"I took a chance and bought this inexpensive grinder. Husband loves it! Fast, quiet, he didn't think it would hold a pot's worth of coffee beans but it works so fast it doesn't matter! Reviews work!"
4,fast and fine grind,"One short button push gets you a quick fine coffee grind, but 2 out of 5 times I got a few larger bean fragments so had to regrind, nice deep container and easy to empty, wish it would give an option of a courser grind, good sturdy, quality made machine and quiet operation. Not bad for the price."
5,Mighty Mite Coffee Grinder,"We loved this grinder. It lasted 15 years, ground coffee to desired fineness, quickly ground the beans and was easy to clean. At max load it prepared enough coffee for 4 cups of coffee which was perfect for us. We also like rich flavored coffee. It met all our needs with the exception of quantity when company wanted more than 4 cups of coffee."
4,Works like I thought it would,"Not much to say! Grinds coffee fast and uniform (for the most part). Like people say, there's no settings to adjust so you can't pick if you want fine/course, but since I have a drip coffee pot it works for me. If you have a french press, probably go with another model, as you can't get a uniform course ground. Only a fine grind."
3,"Good value, impossible to clean.",This grinder does a good job with creating an espresso-fine grind. Cons-it gets hot enough to burn the beans and it's near impossible to clean.
3,DUST MAKER,"As with any blade grinder you must be careful when pulverizing your beans. Even slight repeated button pushes with this baby and you are going to wind up with mostly grounds for drip makers with the use of a filter a must. Lots of static produced makes it a challenge not to make a mess on transfer to your coffeemaker,as about 10% refuses to leave the plastic top.Inexpensive enough, and a decent item for the newby coffee drinkers.Maybe better suited for spice grinding, so not a total purchase mistake."
4,Good for the price,"We will be upgrading to a coffee maker with a built-in grinder because we're sick of the mess of transferring ground coffee. But, I will be happy to keep this on hand for grinding other foods/spices and the occasional coarse grind for the camping percolator. It's fast and easy to use. I think clean-up is about as easy as it can be when dealing with loose coffee grounds."
2,Blends into coarse grind; Its tough to get blended coffee out of grinder; Hard for cleansing,"Product looks good, but works worse than competitors. Main issues are following:Blends into coarse grind;Its tough to get blended coffee out of grinder;Hard for cleansing"
4,All blades Grinders need improvement,"I currently own 3 different blade grinders and they all suffer from the same problem which is that they do not grind coffee evenly so that you end up with large chunks of coffee among the finer ground particles. Burr grinders are superior but they cost about 4 times as much as a blade grinder and are quite a big larger. My only problem with this grinder is that once ground, the coffee tends to stick to the wall so that it take time to scape it out."
3,Difficult to keep clean,"I was given the grinder when I stated to a friend that I was looking for something to grind whole flax seeds. The product does a good job grinding the flax seeds. It is difficult to keep clean when used in this way, however, I believe because of the seeds' high oil content. A great deal of the ground flax seeds stick to the sides and have to be scraped off sometimes with a lot of pressure. The inside can become damage by doing so and the plastic top can become scratched. Given the price and performance and my desire to consume freshly ground flax seeds I have recently purchased a second one when the original one could no longer be cleaned sufficiently."
2,Died after about a year of use,"I have had a similar product for many, many years till it finally died. I purchased this one a year ago and used it moderately. I use it mainly for grinding spices and flaxseed. It worked great and I was very happy with it but cleaning is hard.I did not submerge the unit in water but I did use water to clean it about a week ago. Using just a cloth won't do the job. So maybe some water got in the unit, I don't know, but today it is dead, morte, not to be revived."
5,A great classic!,"I grew up with my parents grinding their coffee with the earlier model of this grinder. I was very happy when my dad gave it to me when I moved out. After 20+ years of use it finally died. The last two years it did its job even with a crack running down the casing (dropped too many times over the years). Other than an increase in watts & a color change to black, this grinder is the same exact one that I grew up with. It grinds nice & even every time in a matter of seconds. The increase in power makes me wonder whether this one will last as long as my previous one, but even if it only lasts half the time it will still have been well worth it. I hope they never change or stop selling this classic.Cons: 1) It's loud, but you only have to listen for a couple seconds. 2) It grinds pretty fine. For me this isn't a problem, but some people may not like that."
4,Good and efficient grinder for the money. can't go wrong,Only wish that they gave a stiff brush for cleaning. My Black & Decker (which this one replaced) came with one. I still dont understand why the lid has to be so long.
5,Only coffee grinder we use,"We have had other grinders, but this is the only one that we can pour without making a mess directly into the coffee filter."
3,inconvenient,No way to clean well enough as it does not come apart. Difficult to judge how many beans to grind for the amount of ground coffee needed.
2,good only for few uses,"I used it mainly as a spice (black pepper, cardimom, etc) & nuts (peanut, cashew) grinder. All the spices were less hard than coffee beans; I didn't use it for anything very hard like cinnamon sticks.For first few months I used it once in a while & it was great, hence the 2 stars. But pretty soon it has become useless, now it does not grind at all, not even coarse grind!! The blade just rotates and nothing happens; very frustating as it did not even last for a year. Total piece of junk; dont buy it!"
5,NUMBER 1 !!!,"Is it a wonder why this coffee grinder is rated number 1. Fast, quite, and powerful. This coffee grinder is a great buy on Amazon. Krups makes good products and this one is one of there best."
5,A Large Coffee Please,"I need my coffee every morning just like tons of other people do, and I really love this machine. I buy the beans (obviously) because if you buy the grounds they will go bad faster then if you buy the beans. So I buy the beans so I can have fresh ground and fresh coffee every morning. A must have for anyone that buys beans because it is small and compact and works like a dream."
1,disappointed,the grinder worked once before the motor burnt out. on taking it to a repair shop i was told the product was irreparabe
2,not impressed,"we've been carefully reading reviews, and so many coffee grinders seem to be making that high pitched squeal. Including this one. Oh, and there is a smell of burning plastic while I'm grinding. That can't be good. It does grind fine but...."
3,so messy,"makes a good fine grind if that is your brew of preference...but there really is no in between grind. I wish others had mentioned how messy this grinder can be when you open the canister to pour the grind. Also, quite a lot of the grind sticks to the bottom of the grinder if your beans happen to be the oilier kind."
4,A good product,It works well. Just don't too much raw material into it at a time otherwise it may become hot or possible burn.
2,"Worked Great, but only for a short period of time...","I used this grinder for coffee only. It worked great for about 2 1/2 months but then died. The motor quit. I don't use really oily beans and I never overfill the grinder, so I'm not sure why it quit... I expected to get at least a years use. For the price, I guess I got my money/use out of it... I did use it on a daily basis - once in the morning and once in the afternoon."
5,Love it!,"Got this coffee Grinder couple weeks ago and just had a chance to use it yesterday,worked perfectly and quietly! My main purpose of buying this is to use as the spice grinder and I got to tell ya, after a little brushing off, the grinder look as shiney as never been used."
5,"My first ever coffee grinder, but I'm very impressed","I've never owned a coffee grinder before. I'm a relatively new coffee drinker, so I never had to own one before. But, with that said, I didn't expect this coffee grinder to be so effective, efficient, and powerful. It seriously blends whole coffee beans to dust within 2 seconds. I thought it might take even upwards of 10 seconds to do, but it's almost instant. I'm very pleased with the purchase."
2,Oval design not good,"Not the greatest grinder out there. Does a decent job, but my main beef is that due to it's oval design and circular blade, coffee grounds end up stuck to the sides where the blade can't reach. You have to swipe them out with your finger and it creates clumps.Stick with the cirlce grinders."
4,Great for coffee beans...One star off for non-replacable blades,"Purchased new, a ~20 second shake is enough to grind coffee beans for a drip coffee maker.2-4 years later when the non-replaceable blades get dull...It takes a minute or two and Shake Weight effort.Meh...Just recycle your old one and buy a new one. The machine is only $20 a pop.Just remember not to grind your coffee beans in your new Krups with the same time/enthusiasm as your old one or else you'll end up with coffee talc that will clog your coffee maker's drip filter."
5,Great for flax seed,"This is the best grinder for flax seed (2 tablespoon/grind). It is 200 watts and goes through the seeds with ease to a fine mill . Other grinders ( 100 watt) just don't get the job done. I do not use it for coffee , burr grinders are much better for coffee."
5,THIS COFFEE GRINDER WORKS GREAT FOR ME,"this being my first coffee grinder I've ever bought I'm impressed with the way it grinds coffee beans it does it very well. if you grind the beans very fine some of the coffee will stick to the sides but no big deal to me, wished it would have came with a scrapper or brush to clean the sides but again no big deal. I'm happy with the way it works, looking forward to see how it works grinding up spices. I think it was worth the money and I would buy this grinder again."
5,Great for grinding spices,"In approximately 30 seconds, I ground some spices that would have taken about 1 hour to grind by hand. The spices are ground very fine (almost dust) which is what I wanted but could not get easily by hand. And because I can blend the spices right in the unit, that's done too. I haven't cleaned it yet (other than wiping it out when I received it) but understand that for spices, it's best to grind a bit of rice in between for cleaning."
2,Broken already,I used the grill about 6 times and did think it was a great alternative to heating up my oven. I found it needed a few more minutes than the suggested cooking time but cleanup was fast and easy.
4,Very good buy,"This is a Very good buy, the only problem with it is that u cannot detatch the grilling surface for cleanin."
2,Met my low expectations!,Actually carved my turkey very nicely. But the locking mechanism for the blades broke the very first time it was used.
5,One of the best non-fiction history books I have read,"What Young has written is two dozen interesting and relavent biographies that takes place in some of the more interesting times and places in history, remarkably tied together through a single family. He does not delve deeply into anything but art, and yet he has not writen one of those history books of everything at everytime that teach you nothing. Now note that this book is very long and has chapters that might be worth skipping (his descriptions of paintings that you can't see), but if you want to at least be introduced to the dissolution of the catholic church, the growth of objective thinking, the reformation, the rise of monarchies and standing armies, the birth of scientific thought, some really interesting characters, and, more importantly, how they all tie together, than I can not recommend this book highly enough."
5,A must have if you are upgrading,"installed these with other new ignition parts on my 1995 Jeep Cherokee Sport. i replaced my coil, distributor cap and rotor, and spark plugs to newer performance parts. these wires, being able to conduct a larger load to the plugs, were vital components after installing a performance coil. with a larger conductor in the middle, more current gets to the plugs, which results in a better fuel burn, increasing horse power and torque. the housing on these wires, boots and sleeves, are made tough, so you know they can last much longer than an OEM replacement set of wires."
3,MOBSTER HISTORY...GREAT!!!,"This was a very informative book about the the ""mob"" & its supposed ending, however, it skipped around so much from the beginning to the end, the main stream was mixed. The gruesome details were very graphic at times to make you realize this was not just a ""fun"" group. If you like to follow mobster history, this would be the book for you...Have fun reading!!"
4,the fall of the philly mob,"At first this book fails because the author has a tendency to repeat himself--example 'joey merlino was born into a life of crime' is stated over and over again. It is the author's style and it is too repetitive. However, the details provided in this book are a great read and should be read. The survellance photos are quite good as well.This book borders between 3 and 4 stars."
5,HILLARIOUS!!,First it is known in the LCN circles that former members of law enforcement should not become made members. This is one of the rules but yet Previte slipped in. The whole recollection of Merlino (a former racing jockey) and Ralph Natale are hillarious. Time and time again Previte explains how these two could not get on the same page.Anastasia himself gets better with time. He is Philadelphia's Jerry Capeci. Despite the fact that in the scheme of things Previte was a high-level in a crime family that pales in comparison under the previous leaders. A good read and likeable subject!
5,I like this waffle maker very much,"I have had this waffle maker for about a year now, and I like it very much... It is easy to use...I follow the recipe in the instrution manual to the letter, waffles from scratch! and then pour 1/2 a cup of batter ( I use a big ice cream scoop) and then let them cook for exactly 3 minutes, using a timer. It yields about 12 waffles, and I freeze the leftovers, then reheat them in the toaster oven at 450 degrees for 3 minutes. I highly recomend it!"
3,Great Waffles... Can't Clean it,"I love the size and thickness of the waffles that I can make with this waffle maker. However, for the life of me, I cannot understand why it's made not to be cleaned. You will find it VERY hard to clean the inside and outside of this waffle maker. There are many crevices and the plates are not removable to wash. So it's like continuously pouring waffle batter over dirt and old peices of burnt waffles from 5 months ago.Please make waffle makers that can be cleaned!"
2,Uneven baking,"Another thing to add to the list of problems (hot handle, ridiculous tiny, deep crevices to clean with a toothpick) other reviewers have mentioned is the lack of a ""floating hinge"". It is unable to keep the two plates parallel as the waffle expands. So the front opens further, resulting in a back dark half and light front half. Of course, if you underfill, you'll get a dark bottom and light top.The Krups brochure included has a motto on the front: ""Quality by design."" Well, quality is indeed directly related to design and this unit has rather little of either.(BTW, some reviewers seem to have misunderstood the purpose of the ""ready"" light. As explained in the manual, it merely indicates whether the heating element is on. You can start baking when it first turns off, but when it comes back on it doesn't necessarily mean the waffle is done. It just means the plates cooled to the point where the thermostat kicked back in.)"
5,Awesome,"Burgers, chicken or whatever, cooks evenly and quickly and clean up is even better. The removable grates are the best."
3,Less than expected,"It is nice that you can put the parts in the dishwasher, which is so much better than the way you clean the G. Foreman. It cooks much too slow if you keep it open and use both sides. So it is nice, but I expected more."
5,Move over George,"This is a great product. I had one for years and by my own fault ruined it. I immediately ordered another one, I use it so often. Love the fact that the grill surfaces are removeable and very easy to clean. If I'm not cooking on the outdoor grill this is what I'm using."
2,Design or Quality Control Problem? Uneven Cooking,"Good price here at Amazon.com...BUT...uneven cooking...fish and chicken cooked on this grill have uncooked spots at various interior while points while at the same time exterior is scorched at places. I could supervise and rotate items being cooked, I suppose...but that isn't supposed to be necessary on a convenience product, is it?"
3,Not as well as old grill....,"My Dad got this grill to replace the George Foreman. And it was good at first but it is in no way compared to the George Forman in the taste. I admit it has lasted us two years now with no teflon problems but the taste of the food and the way it is not really that slated keeps all the grease on the grill. I personally like my old George Forman better and I think my parents do to. As this grill is rarely used it is used more in summer but still not used that often and is large and bulky and even quite heavy. The grills are hard to clean as the food burns easily on this grill. I also hate the fact it takes longer to cook everything compared to the George Forman. But, this is my opinion compared with the George Forman grill we owned."
2,Not as good as i would like,This is my third in-door grill. I am disappointed that Hamilton Beach has not up graded it.The good features is it has removeable grids for dishwashing. Good size as i like.Does have the option of using both sides for addtional items.The con is no temperture setting. Just one high. Find that many of my foods do stick to grids and very difficult to clean.I really am surprised that Hamilton Beach has not upgraded it as others do have temperture controls.
1,broken,"I was excited about this purchase, but it was broken. The timer and light worked, but the plates did not heat up. The amazon seller said I could not return it to them because I had thrown away the box. But the seller said I could call Hamilton Beach for a replacement. I did, and Hamilton Beach said they will send me a replacement. I hope the new one works."
4,mizoguchi's portrait of the artist,"In a career littered with period films this is one of the rare examples where the master Japanese filmmaker Mizoguchi Kenji portrayed an actual historical figure, though ""Utamaro and His Five Women"" hardly shoots for a factual representation of an artist's life. ""Utamaro"" does not aim to be a literal biography but is instead an imagining of the great painter in the prime of his career and his relationship with his models - a relationship that mirrors Mizoguchi's own love/hate relationship with women. This film has the formal beauty one expects from the director, but lacks much else that is memorable. Perhaps ""Utamaro"" is best left for admirers of the director - initiates to Mizoguchi should look for ""Sisters of the Gion,"" ""Osaka Elegy,"" ""Ugetsu,"" ""A Geisha"" (aka ""Gion Music Festival"") or his masterpiece ""Sansho the Bailiff"" instead. The VHS of ""Utamaro"" from New Yorker is terribly blurry and also unfortunately out-of-print."
4,for the kitchen,"It worked great over thanksgiving, it was a replacement of an older one that was broken. I would order it agan."
4,looks good,"I gave this food chopper as Christmas Gifts, but have not heard back from any one yet. Received sooner than I thought."
2,poor quality of body plastic,The mixing container cracked within the first month of its use. I had used a Blac and Decker before and thought that this would be better than that. But I was wrong. The plastic body is poorly made and is quite flimsy. Buy Hamilton beach of Black and Decker instead.
4,Works well for making baby food,"I've only used the food chopper once so far, but it worked great for making baby food, which was the purpose of purchasing it. It is quite a bit louder than I expected, but I can deal with the noise, and my son loved his bananas!"
5,Great tool.,"This is a great chopper. It is small, so don't expect it to handle large tasks, but because it's small I use it a lot -- not much cleanup, and it's not difficult to pull out of the cabinet. I use it for onions (you have to cut them in half first), because chopping onions by hand is a pain. I've also made delicious pesto in it; just put the basil, olive oil, nuts, garlic, and a hunk of parmesan in it and twist the top to make it go. The blade is sharp (I cut myself while washing it once) so be careful. Fortunately, it doesn't start unless the top is on and twisted into the closed position, so you don't have to worry about chopping fingers by accident."
3,Worked well while it lasted,"Very Useful for onions, peppers, etc - Definitely a time saver. However the bowl melted in the dishwasher! Customer service was a disaster and I could not obtain a replacement part. I am going to buy another chopper - as I realize how i have missed it. It won't be a Proctor Silex brand though."
1,Good -- while it works,"It works very well, when it's not broken. Unfortunately, in the 2+ months since I bought one, 2 have broken. The bowl on the first one cracked in several places after about 3 uses, the store gave my a new one, then only a little more than a month later, it suddenly died while chopping nuts."
2,Not pleased,I was hoping this chopper would be a nice replacement for an old Toastmaster chopper I have that has a cracked lid. This chopper is even smaller than the Toastmaster... So I am trying to find someone to give it away to and plan to buy a 3 cup chopper (my old one was 2 cups) as this thing is just too small...
3,Stinks,"I lot of dry words. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. If you make these reviews too much of a bother, I won't do them any more."
1,"Looks great, but....","As with all plastic grinders, static is a problem.The plastic broke on my unit very quickly.Any kind of blade mill grinder is going to result in uneven coffee grounds, and it will be impossible to get a fine grind. For $10 more you can get a cheap burr grinder, which gives better results (flavor!)"
1,Rival Crockpots,"I bought 2 Rival Crockpots (slow cookers) over the last 2 months and I had to bring them all back because they were cooking too hot. A slow cooker should not boil on low and you should be able to cook on low and let it cook for 8 to 10 hours. Also, you should be able to slow cook a tough piece of meat and make it tender by keeping it on low. Your meal should not cook in 2 or 3 hours on low. I will never buy a Rival Product again and it seems that even the Programmable ones are defective."
2,Wears out too fast for working great,"I wanted to add another voice to the reviews that warn people that this product wears out too fast. Ours quit after less than a year. If replacement parts were easy and cheap, I would fix it myself because the result of successfully opening a can with this product is GREAT. The lid is reusable, which is great for pet food. No sharp edges. No food contamination. Tough on guests, though, because they don't know can is opened and they tend to spill!It does take some talent to get the thing started on some cans. As the things wears, it gets harder."
1,Beware....,"Received this as a gift and it's another appliance collecting dust. When it works, it works great. Difficult to use if you can ever figure it out."
2,Your reviews changed my mind.Thank you!,"I used this can opener for about 18 months. First I had to learn to use it. It worked very good for about a year and then became gradually more difficult to use. My husband never got the 'hang of it'. I really like the way it opens a can without the sharp edges and intended to order a new one because it will no longer open any can. It appears that this product has a major flaw, namely it only lasts a short while and then you have to go back to the old fashioned way of getting a can open.Since other reviews are similar to mine I have decided not to order another Krups can opener."
2,the good the bad and the ugly,"The ""good"" thing about the Krups can opener, it's the best opener on the market when it is new. The ""bad"" is only getting a couple of years use out of it. It will be difficult to open a can properly and watch out for the fine metal shavings and burrs. The ""ugly"" thing is what it will do if it doesn't open the can and you get stuck or cut by the metal shavings or barbs. ...It was a promising kitchen tool."
5,Awesome movie,"When I was a teenager Mulan came out. I saw it with my little cousins. I laughed so much at Eddie Murphys character, The Great And Powerful Mooshoe!I bought my cousins a copy, bought my sister a copy, then bought one for me! Like this movie a lot!"
5,Great movie,This is a great movie with catchy songs. this was a purchase for my two year old daughter and she loves this movie. Theirs no full moment in this movie. Overall a really great movie and I would recommend to anyone boy or girl.
4,Heartfelt story about love and honor,"I had not seen Mulan in a very long time and it was fun to watch it with my kid. It is a great story about honor, honoring your parents and your country, and love; and how love and honor are intermingled. My only problem was with the digital technology. My roku was having some issues with the wireless network and I have three children looking at me asking why the movie wasn't coming on and if I could please fix it. Don't know, might be worth to get the hard copy."
2,Not what I expected,I wanted it for the DVD player at school where I work and it doesn't work on it - it will play on the computer - so not sure what the problem is.
1,confused,I may have missed that this was being shipped from Germany. Unfortunately it was a last minute Christmas gift and upon arrival it will not play. It says it is unauthorized to be played in this area. Needless to say I was very disappointed that my 40 dollars had gone to waste.
1,Mulan and my Liking of it,I did not get to play the movie due to the fact it came in the wrong langage...I speak english and it's something I do not understand!!!
3,"Great movie, awful DVD","I love this movie, but like the other Di$ney DVDs released - the quality of the picutre and sound (not to mention the complete lack of extra features) is awful. If you want to see the way animation SHOULD look on DVD, check out the Prince of Egypt or The Iron Giant, Di$ney's DVD quality is shameful."
4,"Great service, and delivery!","The product was new like described, and works perfectly. My daughter is completely happy, and the item was delivered quickly."
2,movie loading,It sucked!!!! Tt froze every few seconds and this rental was a rip off. I will never rent another movie from amazon again.
3,video quality lacking,"It was quick and easy to upload the video, but the quality was lacking. It was fuzzy or grainy through most of it. It looked like it has been taped in movie theatre. We like the show and the kids enjoyed watching. It's nice to have this option to access movies, but... the quality wasn't as good as I expected."
5,A Fantastic Movie,"Mulan got me interested in Disney again. I've always loved their movies but the last few years I have not enjoyed the movies at all. At 20 years old, I thought I was growing out of Disney (a somewhat disconcerting thought *S*) but Mulan proved that wrong. It was great, a fantastic story, it's a movie I can watch again and again. I will definately be buying the video.I loved the strong female character, the fact that she used her mind as well as the fighting skills she learned was great. Disney did a good job with Mulan by giving us a movie that adults and children both can watch and love. I can only hope they can repeat that quality in their next effort. Mulan is my favorite Disney movie besides Beauty and the Beast.I would strongly recommend this to anyone who can tolerate animated movies, it is not one to miss."
5,Mulan reminds one of old Disney - unlike their last 2 films,"Mulan's story sets a wonderful example for the children who watch it. Girls who watch it will become empowered by its feminist undertones. For boys, the film demonstrates how one can be macho and sensitive. And for adults, the movie has enough humor and plot to hold their attention too!"
4,So funny!,This is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. (This and Emperor's New Groove). I love when Disney has a sense of humor and you can clearly see it in this one.
1,Sending to another country,Knowing this was being sent to USA it would have been good for the sellar to share that the DVD would not work in a DVD player in the USA due to country restrictions. I am not able to use it and it was a full waste of money. The ad was written in English and I had no idea the DVD was produced in Germany.
1,Review of recent purchase,"I recently ordered Mulan 2-disc Special Edition from Amazon. I was thoroughly disappointed because there were no discs inside the case! I had to return it and because I no longer trust Amazon, I went to Borders and bought the dvd. It's a great movie, too bad Amazon failed!"
1,Joe Pesci Should've Died!,"First things first: How the hell did a little green dragon suddenly appear and become her guide? When the Mongol hoards came at China, why were they four times the size of the normal guys and why could they jump off cliffs and not get hurt? And then when, miraculously, all the Mongol hoards died except for 12 people, how did those people suddenly get to Beijing within 5 days without any horses? And how did 12 Mongols defeat the entire captain of the guard for the Emperor, and take him hostage? And for the finale, how did a little Chinese girl take out Genghis Khan with a staff when he had a sword and was seven times her size? On further note: Eddie, we know your drug addiction is using up a lot of your money, but that is no excuse to sell your voice to a shotty movie like this! Disney, your ideas are stale, your productions have gone down the drain, and soon, your park just might fall down...be warned! I'll be forming an anti-Disney strike. See you soon."
5,Fabulous movie! Congratualations to Wah Lum Kung Fu Temple,"A terrific movie. All the martial arts in the film (too brief -- my only complaint) was drawn from real videos of two martial artists here in the USA. The two lead characters, Mulan and Captain Li Shang, were modeled on Sifu (teacher) Mimi Chan and Sifu George Kee of the Wah Lum Kung Fu Temple in Orlando, Florida. Both are students of the incredible Grandmaster Chan Pui who brought Wah Lum to this country. The tale itself is fabulous, the animation deeply detailed and rich, and the story not too scary even for relatively young children (my 5 year old did just fine at the theater). I highly recommend it."
5,"excellent story, OK drawings","I'm a Hong Kong Chinese, this story is one of the best. (it's a required text in Chinese language course for all Form 3 students here). Disney does a good job in bring this to the screen. However, I must say in general the drawing of Mulan pale in comparison with Prince of Egypt, Anatasia. it's just too 2-D. I think Disney must work harder before its position in cartoon making get replaced."
4,Easy to make delish waffles,"This machine is simple to use, and the nonstick coating makes it easy to flip out the waffles w/o any batter sticking to the plates. Depending on how long you cook the waffles, you can make them as crispy as you want w/o burning the outside. My only complaint is that it's difficult to clean the outside when batter leaks into the crevices - I need to use a toothbrush to fully clean it. The plates are really easy to clean with a wet cloth, though. Overall, I recommend this machine to anyone who wants to make delicious waffles in no time at all (I've gained four pounds since I bought this!)."
3,"OK, but not as good as the first one","The Lion King is one of my favourite movie. The second movie it's ok but not as good as the first one. It has poor songs, poor animation and a very poor action. However it has interesting bonus features like games or making-of. I suggest you think before buying this Disney DVD."
2,Story line and talent is a lame knock off of the orignal.,"If you liked the talent, story and sheer majesty of the original ""Lion King"", you will wince at this lame, opportunistic knock off of the original formula. Although Disney has mastered the art of taking one story line and respinning it through the years into countless permutations, Lion King II takes this approach to a new low.Visual production values are fine, and young children won't know the difference, but you will be disapointed."
3,It's all right I guess....,"I liked the first one better and when I saw this one, I wasn't too impressed. I mean, it's O.K. but I think they could've done better. In my opinion, I don't think the songs are THAT great, and Kiara has a ""girly"" personality. Zira is nothing like Scar, and she wasn't even mentioned in the first movie and neither were the Outlanders. Nuka is a TOTAL KLUTZ and I don't even want to start on Zazu. The only character I liked in this movie was Vitani. (really cool) Kovu is a total insult to the movie, and he is NOTHING like Scar. Don't waste your time on this movie and find something else to watch. The only 2 songs that are ""good"" are ""Love will find away"" and ""We are One"". Zira's song ""My Lullaby"" isn't is good as Scar's ""Be Prepared."" If you want to see this sequel, go right ahead. I mean, it's OKAY . It's not the BEST Movie in the world."
4,The whole movie was an exciting adventure!,This is definitely something you would want to see over and over again
5,Great movie!,"I purchased the video for my son and he loves it so much, he watches it 3 times a day. I've always enjoyed Disney movies because they are simple and entertaining, so to all those critics who say that this movie is kind of juvenile, remember, it was intended for a younger audience. Get over yourselves."
4,Awesome Show!!,Absolutely enjoyed it almost as good as the first one. But as you know the sequel can never beat the prequel.
1,The Lion King 2 - Simba's Pride,"Just want you to know that I am unable to give a review of this DVD. It has not arrived YET. My grandchildren were looking forward to traveling over the Thanksgiving holiday and planned to view Simba's Pride. I am VERY disappointed. I haven't purchased much from Amazon since I retired. During my tenure as a school secretary I was very happy with the service received from Amazon, but this order has not been successful."
3,An OKAY Movie,"When I first saw The Lion King, I thought it was really good. But when I saw this one, NOTSOGOOD."
5,Simba's Wise Daughter,"i loved this movie. simba is trying to teach his daughter to stay away from a group of lions called the outsiders. following a child's natural curiosity, Kira stumbles into the outlands and there she meets Kovu. The two would not meet again until Kovu, now grown up, saves Kira from a fire. Reluctantly, Simba allows Kovu to join his pride. As Kira and Kovu begins to fall in love, Kovu's mother and her pride attacks Simba as he and Kovu was alone. Thinking that Kovu was part of the plan, Simba excelled him. Kira ran away to find him and they were able to stop the fight between their two prides. As Kira was talking to Simba, the words that she spoke started to make sense. As Kira said,"" They are us. What differnces do you see?"" I would defintly recomend this film to anyone who has children. This movie teaches them that no matter how diffrent everyone seems, we are still one."
3,Simba's Pride surprisingly good!,"As with most movie-goers I was shocked that the original Lion King was not on the top 100 movie list. And after Disney tried to follow with the terrible animated movies Pocahontas and Hunchback of Notre Dame, I had almost given up. However, Simbas Pride was actually a very good movie. My kids were enthralled with the new characters and overjoyed with the return of the old ones. The music was nice, not as soul shaking as the first Lion King, but better than most animated films. My kids loved the movie, we have about six showings daily!!"
3,Disney you ruined the Lion King,I liked the first Lion King alot but this is just wrong. Who are these outsiders. They were lions loyal to scar. In the first Lion King scars only followers were hyenas. Lots of hyenas. This just does not work. Also Timon and Pumba appear to immortal and do not age at all. Simbas Pride is more for kids than the first film. There isn't as much action and it is not as compeling. This film is decent and isn't that bad but don't expect another Lion King.
2,Disc,"The disc didn't work too well - it was too scratched up, but I waited too long to check so I just had to buy a new one."
4,Perfect for my Grand-daughter,Downloaded this movie to my kindle. My 3 year old Grand-daughter loves being able to find it and start it with no help. Cute movie. Download went smooth.
1,Lion King 2...Not good,"This was a ""like new"" video. Was aweful. Kept skipping and 'freezing' .....my daughter cried because she was so excited to see this movie. Never again."
1,The worst disney movie I have seen,King Lion II is one of the worst movies I have seen. I'm a Disney fan so I really am sorry for this. I can't belive Disney could make a bad movie. I understand now why they didn't put in the cinemas and only in video. Don't waste your money and time with this film.
2,Terrible Sequel,"Even when not compared to it's far superior predecessor, ""The Lion King II: Simba's Pride"" falls flat in every way. The songs were terribly annoying and pointless, the animation was some of the worst I've seen from the modern Disney. Gone were the bright and beautiful mix of colors present in ""The Lion King,"" we were instead served with cheap looking darkened artistry. Disney makes many great films, but even more terrible sequels ... this is certainly one of them."
