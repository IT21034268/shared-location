2,Disappointing,Regrettably glossy and superficial treatment of the subject. Neither the history nor biography provided anything of substance. Be content with the Civil War series and move on to something else.
5,PLACEMATS AS PRESENTS,"Twice now on trips abroad I've brought maps of the USA with me in my suitcase, to give as gifts. They pack perfectly, aren't heavy, aren't breakable, and they're greatly appreciated by my foreign friends. On the home scene, I decided we didn't know enough about Canada, our neighbor to the immediate North, so I bought a set of the Canada map for us. These are a good grandmother present, a what-to-give-someone-who-has-everything present, and a learning experience when eating alone. I hope I haven't loused up the Review rating by not rating this at all as a ""toy"". Coming from the ""wears like iron"" generation, I'll add that I have yet to have one of these products deteriorate."
4,Good Band!,"A very good album! I've Appreciated their music. If Many Rock-Metal could be so talentful : good riff, good singer, no yelling...."
2,The worst episode so far,"I real clunker in an otherwise excellent show. The comedienne is poorly scripted in a dramatically unrealistic story, a plot line that, it's quite obvious, has the stars of the show gasping for breath. With the exception of something you learn about Cary, this is the one to skip.May as well mention here that this season has made useless Kalinda's presence on the show. The writers took an excellent, interesting character, and for reasons unknown, made her a lonesome ex-wife of a completely uninteresting thug. She now goes from scene to scene answering the question ""where have you been"" with ""dealing with personal stuff."" Not exactly interesting stuff."
5,good wife,"I like everyhting about this show, I buy all the releases and will continue to buy until the season is complete"
5,Awesome Art,"All of their work is awesome, I'm very pleased. I submitted a review when I first got them, I don't know why Amazon says that I didn't! Hmmm... :) 5 stars for the beautiful plates! '"
2,Fierce Attachments,"Poorly written, unbelievable, boring, insulting to many women who have chosen to be stay-at-home moms. My entire book club disliked this book"
5,one of the best memoirs,Gornick has a real ear for dialogue. This book is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. Her writing is glorious. Her perceptions about herself and others are beautifully drawn.
4,"Still Crazy, Always Sexy, Forever Cool...","A collection of TLC's past, present, and future. Now & Forever tells you just that, TLC will be here forever through their music now. The album features all of the singles TLC has released except for just a few. The only disappointment on the album is the inclusion of ""In Your Arms Tonight"" and the exclusion of ""I'm Good At Being Bad."" ""IYAT"" really has no place on the album since it was never released as a single or even contemplated to be released while ""IGABB"" has been and was a hit all across the globe. TLC featured two new tracks including an unreleased track from the 3D sessions, ""Whoop De Woo"" (which pulls a rap from one of TLC's own songs, ""I Need That,"" and REUSES IT!), as well as ""Come Get Some,"" produced by Lil' Jon. What a collaboration. Definitely a must own if you don't own any of the albums or if you are a TLC fan."
2,Meh,"These are flimsy and too big for index cards, so they're always falling off. Clear vinyl contact paper works better."
5,A classic of So Cal punk,"That's my brother down below there. I had no idea he even put a review here, so it was funny to come across it! He bought it for me, but I ended up having to replace it just recently. I can't say enough good things about this band. They were around the San Diego scene from the early '90s until about '99 or so when they finally folded. If you like green day, but abhor having political views sung to you, then you might like these guys. If you like Rancid, but don't think you have to wear funny clothes to be a punk, then these guys are for you. If you like Blink182, but think that polished studio sound has no place in punk rock, this is your band. Other influences that come to mind are The Ramones, Sex Pistols, Dwarves and who knows what else? Great, great band from my youth."
1,Linksys WRT54GS,Purchased this pruduct and never got a signal to reach more that 15 ft.Gave up threw it in the closet.
3,Spotty coverage,"I'm not sure it's my building or what, but sometimes I lose the connection within my own apartment. Generally provides decent coverage."
1,Worst Router Ever,"This router has given me nothing but trouble. It worked fine for about 2 months but then all of a sudden the connection drops for all wired computers and for any wireless devices it shows that there is limited to no connection available. The only way to solve this is to power cycle the unit. After doing so the connection stays for about a day or so maximum and the same problem happens again.I spoke to Linksys tech support and they solved my problem by updating the firmware. The bad thing is that 2 days later the piece of crap started doing the same thing again.I also know several people that have had similar problems with this same exact model. Please do not purchase this product and go with a reliable company like d-link or netgear. I had a netgear router before this and it worked flawlessly. I had to ""upgrade"" to a wireless router because I bought a laptop, nintendo Wii, and a nintendo DS that requires wireless connection and Linksys routers are extremely unreliable."
1,Bad!,"This router is the worst we have ever had. It crashes every other time we try to use the wireless network. We have to uplug it and restart everything to get our computers to connect. Also, the wizard meant to help troubleshoot problems doesn't work properly."
2,Cost me thousands of dollars,"It goes down once a day, I would say. In the search for the problem, and in the down time, and in the complaints to my ISP thinking they were the problem, this has likely cost me $1000's of dollars, as I am a web entrepreneur. That is not to mention that this is a replacement for my WRT54G, which seemed defective in the same manner, so I threw it out. What I have now read is to watch out for cordless phone interference. Maybe that will solve the problem.The user interface and advisor is ok, but not great. It misses several items that I wish were there.So, I wish I had gotten a phone and router that didn't interfere with each other. Whether this is a problem with routers or just linksys I don't know. But, in any case, it appears linksys failed to sell me a product that works for myself and a large number of people."
2,Loses Connection,"I have this router. I have been pretty unhappy with it. It loses the connection very easily, if the microwave is on or if one of the cordless phones is on (or a call comes in). I had a D-Link router before that never had any problems with dropping connection. Also, the software that comes with the router is okay for someone who doesnt really want to do anything as far as adjusting settings. But to make any adjustments to the router (such as set up security, MAC Filtering, etc) it is kind of a pain. If I had to buy it again...I'd pass.PS-The speed booster doesnt really make a difference for us mortals with cable modem connections."
4,not bad,"the installation is not hassle free, but after everything is done, it is pretty stable and fast."
3,Help,I'm started to go online with my Wii and in month i'm getting my X-Box 360.But my computer is at the other side of my house and i can't move it.Will Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBoosterBe the best thing to get if i'm going to be playing games for long hours.If not What is?
4,Works as expected,replaced an older 11Mbit Linksys router and it seems to have equal or better range while still connecting at the faster speeds. Working as advertised I would say.
4,Excellent Router,"I purchased this router to round out my new wireless home network. The router is excellent, easy to maintain and the security works very well. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the setup software. The instructions say to use the CD that comes with it, but it would not setup the router correctly. I went to the Linksys website and used their Windows XP tool and in about 2 minutes I had a wireless network! Very pleased, and as usual, Linksys makes outstanding products."
5,Did what I wanted it to.,"I needed something (not-N) that was relatively cheap, worked ""out of the box"" (with the Wizard, of course) and had excellent range. I needed to test it by connecting it with a Linksys wired router through a hub and the instructions on the Linksys web site were on point. No problems after two weeks, and it reaches from the basement to the opposite corner of the second floor."
4,Very good except for one problem!,"This wireless router is very good. I play online games routinely and it just rocks.However when the power goes out and comes up again, This router doesn't come up automatically at times. And the settings need to be reset. Which is why 4 stars."
1,Do NOT Buy,"Formerly very please with this devices for its parental controls service. I really trusted the Linksys name over all other with bonus when Cisco bought them. I now change my vote to DLink and a Do Not Buy on this product because the main feature, the parental controls is no longer supported:The Linksys Parental Controls service is no longer accepting subscription renewals.We apologize for any inconvenience and encourage you to look for other Parental Controls options before your subscription expires.PS: I am a network infrastructure professional (Cisco CCNA)"
2,slow speed,netgear 624 will download 450kb sec wirelesslinksys with speedbooster only will do 250kb net gear with card cast 54.99 with card
5,excellent product,"no problems so far with 1 airport extreme card and one linksys PCI 802.11g on a win xp box. using stock firmware.worked well immediately, is fast, and stable.avoid the d-link pci card, had problems with this router."
2,Very bad customer service and be ready to purchase an extended guarantee if you plan to keep the product for a while.,"2 yearsI purchased a BERs41 router that I used for a couple of months, now I tryed to used it again and even I have connection in the computer it wont open any website, therefore I called to support system and they told me my guarantee was over and for them to tell me how make it work I will have to pay US$32.00 I dont understand why, since the router is not broken or anything, they wont help me at all if I dont pay the extended guarantee. No supervisor was ever available, sometimes I will be on hold for 40 minutes!!! At the end I got a Netgear router with a very helpful customer support and I AM NEVER USING ANY LINKSYS PRODUCT AGAIN"
5,Effortless setup,After debating whether to purchase an a+b+g router I went with the G speedbooster. Setup was effortless and my connection was instantaneous - I did'nt even need to follow all of the instructions. I would highly recommend this router for home users.
2,Router - poor choice,"I bought this from Amazon.com in 2007. It failed & Amazon quickly replaced it. It was difficult to set up and I had to call Linksys cust support to get it installed. From then till now it has worked sporatically, but mostly stayed on. Then I bought a new Win 7 PC. The CD didn't work for whatever reason. When I called Linksys Cust Supt for help they wanted $40. I got a new Netgear for under $60 that installed easily and works steadily & reliably. Do not waste you money on Linksys. Amazon has lots of solid models thaqt arn't much more that a Linksys support call."
5,Works fine - but be careful of installing firmware!,"I'm using this router at home with two notebook/adapter combinations: WPC54GS/WinXP and WPC11/Win98SE. The router seems to work just fine.The only problem I've had was with trying to upgrade the firmware, which fried the router somehow. I went through troubleshooting with customer service, got a RMA, and had a replacement in about a week - with the new firmware already installed.Customer service itself was fine, even if the phone queue was sometimes a bit long. Considering they provide 24-hour free human support, I think it's decent. When problems went beyond what the first level of techs could manage, they bumped me up to the more experienced people. There's the added bonus of being able to trade balut stories with the people on the other end."
4,Good router after it's been configured correctly,"This is actually a great router if you have a cable connection. I have a DSL connection, and the tech support person that I talked to at Linksys told me that their routers have alot of problems trying to install with a DSL connection. So if you have DSL, I would consider another type of router unless you don't mind manually configuring this with the help of tech support (they were really helpful, by the way) or if you have alot of knowledge about networks and can do this yourself. After installing my router with the help of tech support, it works great! It took about 30 to 45 mins. to set this up manually. I'm glad their tech support is free! :O)"
2,Unreliable,"The internet connection is used all day long. This thing has to be powered off and back on 2-3 times every day. The Linksys support site has not been helpful. When it works, it works. It doesn't work ALOT."
2,Power reset needed every couple of days,"The wireless services appear to be swamped / frozen and not responding every second or third morning and it is necessary to reset the device with the power cable. This was a replacement device for an earlier linksys router version that died. The Linksys power adapters seem to fail every couple of years so I have seen several generations of linksys routers but this WRT54GS is the most unreliable linksys I have had, failing around twice per week. It is in the same location and setup as the previous one and I use two different linksys routers on different networks here. I am running the latest version(7) and the latest firmware (v7.50.2) so there are no easy fixes yet."
2,Mac is not well supported,"I think maybe I'm having a bad experience with WRT54GS because I'm using both XP and OS X. Every other day, the router stop responding, then I can't even connect to the router until I reset it.I upgraded the firmware to the latest, 1.50.9 released 10/1/06. It worked fine for a couple of weeks, then my mac mini couldn't get any DHCP assigned, even it was connected with Ethernet. This is a known problem, but Linksys hasn't been updated their firmware, and the user can't download older version of firmware from their site.I didn't see Apple OS X as one of supported OS, so I guess it's not a Linksys' fault. But if you're using an OS X, you should avoid this router."
4,No more parental controls,"Amazon's review still states that the router has built-in parental controls. It no longer does. I made my purchase largely based on that and was informed that the parental controls were only in version 1 & 2. The version I received was version 5, so the likihood of you getting a v1 or v2 router is slim. Good router, just missing an important feature."
4,Good product but.......,"Product works well after installation but not easy to install on windows other than XP. They don't mention their install website. www.linksys.com/easy to make non-XP installations. Watch the encription selection and how many letters your pass code has. It makes a difference. Signal from one room to another is low, but does work well."
5,excellent performer/support,The router performs as advertised. What sets it apart is the excellent phone support. I spent 3 minutes on hold and they took me step by step through troubleshoot & setup.
3,WRT54GX is good in range but Access Restrictions not work,"I have purchased WRT54GC to increase my Wireless Range and Security, But only range better than older WRT54G and Access Restriction doesn't work at all. All traffic block when I enforce any policy. I am going to use LINUX IPTABLES with this router for my needs"
4,If at first you don't succeed....,"I bought my first Lynksys router and it worked for about 2 hours, and then kaputted. After figuring out that it wasnt just a cable or bad internet, the power light wouldn't come on at all. Defective. I returned it, and haven't had any problems with my new 2nd router."
4,Linksys WRT54GS,"After first hooking it up, the router could not get on the internet. After connecting with Linksys and changing some settings, it has worked ever since.However after taking one wireless computer off line, we lose out internet connection. This might be caused by the router or the modem."
2,Not worth the time,"Intriguing story line, but Saul needs to stick to one POV or another. All that head-hopping didn't leave room for character development. I never connected with any of the characters, and as a result, I didn't care what happened to them. The ending was too neat and predictable."
3,Thin but palpable.,"This is my first excursion into Saul and I am compelled to comment that I am a bit dissapointed. While I have to say that I was entertained and it was a very quick read, the plot did not have enough meat. I really had a hard time finding out what motivated the good-guys and the bad-guys. While the idea behind this opus of ""speculative fiction"" is rather intriguing, he didn't flesh out enough of the ""speculation"" to quench my curiosity. I wanted to write more to the story and keep it going. This would make a better story-board than novel."
1,Amature video with very limited information,Definetely NOT the ultimate guide to anythng. Brief and poorly filmed. A disappointment. I had hoped for a lot more due to the title. I have located some books that provide me with the information I was looking for.
4,Good (only) option,"Not a whole lot of choices here...If you have a compatible set of headphones, and you've lost/torn up the pads that came with it - these are your option.Still, being your only option doesn't negate the fact that they work very well and are comfortable."
2,Pros and Cons,Pros: Nice size and when it plays it plays wellCons: Battery doesn't last too long and some websites audios do not play properly. I try to listen to CBS Sportsline Fantasy review and the audio does't work properly through these speakers. It's very low and cracky.
5,very well liked,I bought these speakers as a gift for my nephews since i have one. they really like them they us them for their ipods instead of their ear plugs. I have just placed another order because i can't keep mine away from my daughter
4,Why not?,"Christian or not, this music is pretty good- not really understanding the issue some people are having with it (as they are not throwing it in your face.)The lyrics aren't necessarily the most profound, however there are some neat things in there for everyone. Music itself is current to most modern music and as far as the Oi and punk vibe, I don't see much of it here; but for a rock band they have a lot to offer. The vocals have a sense of the punk feel; there are a lot of backing vocals that add dimension and a rad energy but the bagpipes are a little strange to me, they don't sound like they fit in easily?? I may just need to listen a little more.I was expecting or hoping for a little more so I recommend really checking it out if you have a certain sound you are looking for. Not disappointed at all, just not what I was really seeking out."
3,The Truth about X-Men Next Dimension...,"Well lets see here... I found X-Men Next Dimension to be better than the previous X-Men fighter games. This is of course because we are talking PSX 1 to PSX 2. Other than this the game itself was decent, for a fighter title that is.Although fighter titles are not my favorites I did find this game entertaining even though it became slow and sluggish as I went on. The reason I gave this game a mediocre rating is becaue it is mediocre by nature. This game could have been so much more and it wasn't, I'd suggest renting before buying hands down. Still it could be worse... it could have been Silent Hill 4: The Toilet! :)"
2,"Had potential, but...","The short version: each level takes too long to load, the game is buggy, and the response of the characters is very slow. Not worth it unless you're a die-hard X-Men fan."
4,"Good, could use some improvements","For an X-Men Fighting game, this is one of the best. It is fun and has great replay value. I love the story mode feature, you follow a story like watching a movie or reading the comics. But, it can get a little annoying because you can't save your progress and fighting the same fights time and time agian gets old. But overall I love this feature and wish more games would have it.My biggest gripe would be some of the characters. For the most part a good job was done in choosing the characters for the game, but I have always disliked the idea of X-Men with guns, so finding out that Forge was a character erked me. Then I realized Mystique also carried a gun. Then to my horror I found out Bishop was a secret character! Maybe some people like Bishop, but I could live without him. I would love to see Colossus, Iceman, Archangel, Shadowcat or Dazzler in a game. I would also like more action/adventure and less X fighting games."
4,Works great!,I used this product in my E30 1991 BMW 318is (Getrag 5-speed). The housing has a red label/orange label. I flushed out the old fluid and put in 1.3 bottles of RP. I only drove the car for a few miles and I can tell there was a positive difference in shifting. Overall shifting became easier. I'll update this review after some more break-in.
4,ONLY TWO PLAYERS AGAIN,"Well once again a game with the capabilities to only let two players play. Why is their so many 1 or 2 player games now. The game has 4 ports why not use them or get rid of them! I have a lot of friends over all the time to play multiplayer games that I consider a mutiplayer game is 4 players can play at one time in campaign or head to head! not what these guys are offering. I was very disappointed with Mech assalt when it became apparent that multiplayer is 1 or 2 players, is this what microsoft considers (multiplayer).I had the game 2 weeks before I got rid of it for that purpose.Great game but I have enough of these 1 or2 player(deceiving) multiplayer games! I think if Micosoft keeps this up they will go the route of DREAMCAST,3DO AND ALL OF THE OTHER PRETENDERS to the gaming throne."
3,rent before you buy,This is definetly a rent game unless you a mech fan. all you do is blow up people and you can only use 3 weapons per mech. the controls are horrible all you can do is shoot and throw flares. wosrt of all absolutely NO customization.
2,This game sucks.,"I've been waiting for this game to come out for some time now, and I have to say that I'm very disapointed. To be fair, it's ok, but the cons far outweigh the pros. I hate frustration in a game. The fact that if you fail a mission, anywhere in the mission, and you have to start completely over is b.s. Especially if that mission took you over half an hour to get that far. No checkpoints. Sorry, but HALO got me quite used to them. It goes on from there. After all the anticipation, I'm so disgusted I can't see straight. I'm going to list mine on eBay to sell it as soon as I'm done with this review. Save your money and try to find it used. Better yet, just rent it. I'm just gonna wait for HALO 2 to come out. So much for hype."
4,Almost there...,"Ok, we all know that the brother to this game (mechwarrior) had minor problems, but Mech Assault seems to have made up for most of these.(Control problems,choppy graphics,etc...) There are tons of missions,some of which are stupid hard and others that are just not hard enough. This however makes for an interesting game. I have played this game just long enough to know that it is a must-have for any X-Box owner. Mech Assault is weak compared to the monstrosity know as Steel Battalion.(If you are planning to buy SB then don't even think about buying this, just save your money because SB is going to be 200+ dollars.(But well worth it. Overall Mech Assault is a very good game."
4,"Great Title, if you have Xbox Live","This is a really fun game, and not your typical Mech simulator. The controls resemble those of Halo, except you're playing from the 3rd person rather than the 1st person. The missions are not overly difficult, but fun.The real value in this game is with Xbox live. The multi-player is fun, but there is another benefit. Beginning in January 2003, there will be a rather large volume of downloadable additional content made available, and it is expected to be free content. This means more maps, more mechs, and more multi-player game types. Without Xbox Live, you will be unable to access this extra content. This is a 5 star title with Xbox live, but a 4 star title without."
1,this game stinks,"nothing like the pc sim. Maker should not have put it in the ""Mech"" line of games, maybe a better title would be Robot Attact for Kids. This is a kiddie game. 'nuff said."
4,A picture book that shows the still beautiful Grace Kelly,A good book but a reality check that we do grow old but are still beautiful. That is how Grace Kelly was. She was still a beautiful person through her looks and her charity work.
3,Might be great if it worked,We have been unsuccessful with this e-reader attachment since we purchased it. Cards read once and never again. Doesn't matter if we use the GB SP or Advance. Still doesn't do anything. Don't recommend you waste your money!
4,Upgrading from FrontPage to Expression Web,"Expression Web is a great product that competes very favorably with professional web design tools such as Dream WeaverHowever, FrontPage up-graders need to be aware that web component wizards, form designer or like conveniences are gone in Expression WebFrontPage users should expect a significant learning curve if they are not familiar with designing cascading style sheets (CSS), creating web databases and the like. Plan to use FrontPage for your published sites until your skill sets have been upgraded too."
2,Is this an upgrade or a downgrade?,I hate to be critical but I have been building with FrontPage 2002 for several years. It has a variety of templates and features but I thought it was time for an upgrade.I am thankful that the original FrontPage is still running on my laptop or I don't think my latest sites would be up yet. It may be like other programs that you can obtain training or take a class to do the things that FrontPages just does automatically. I'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade seems a little misleading.
1,Appearance is deceiving,"It has a sleek, modern look, and handles 4 slices of toast, bagels or english muffins, but that's all I can say good about this toaster. I bought it expecting high-tech results, or at least evenly toasted bread, and a warming setting to keep it from drying out while I finished making breakfast. Instead I get bread close to burned at the bottom and untoasted at the top, and the warming setting is useless. The directions say only ""press the warm button"" which makes it light up but doesn't keep anything warm after toasting. I can't return it without the box so I'm stuck with a $40 mistake. I regret not checking the Amazon reviews before I made this purchase."
5,You don't know what lurks around the corner!,"This was my first RE game ever, and at first I didn't do good. I did not conserve ammo at all, and I got up to the mansion. My first encounter with a leech zombie was freaky!!! I was in the bath room, there were no zombies. I collected a bottle and gasoline, and then I was off back to the hall way back to the main room. Then, it appeared! I thought it was another zombie, so I assumed a shotgun was appropiate for this monster. It turned out that I wasted all my shotgun ammo on it, and plus it exploded on me! If you ever encounter one, three molotov cocktails (empty bottle + gasoline) should do the trick! Also, this game has many puzzles, that might require one partner to do something while having the other do something else (rebbeca hitting switch while billy gets hookshot). So, make sure to conserve ammo (you don't need to take out all the zombies you encounter) unless you are in easy mode, then you might be ok."
4,"Well crafted, if predictable","This is,I believe, the third in the series, so the layout of the story and characters were familiar. That is not a bad thing as the protagonists need not be completely developed to make the story flow.The private Security consultant is, therefore, easier to accept sa the ""Cowboy Chick"" out simply for herself. Prescott does enough to add empathy for this character while at the same time establishing the FBI lady as the stable one, yet prone to accept assistance from the ""loose cannon"" civilian. This is the key to TV series e.g. like Castle surviving through several seasons.Overall, the story moves nicely with just enough angst to worry us about the possibility of failure on either ladies' parts. I was pretty sure both would survive so the ending was, for me, just a bit predictable. All thing considered, still a good read and i can recommend it."
4,Help I couldn't put this book down!,"I have not read any of Michael Prescott's books before but as soon as I finished ""Mortal Faults"" (which I stayed up all night to finish), I went out and and purchased ""Dangerous Games"" where our plucky heroines did meet. Don't pick up this book until you have cleared your schedule, caffenied up, and made a cozy nesting space. Then cuddle up and enjoy."
2,Crummy Book,"This is one of those thrillers where everything happens within a one-day period and the characters zip from shootout to beating to concocting some bizarre, byzantine plan to trap the bad guy, etc., without sleep, without pain, without second thoughts. To me, this is the sign of a lazy novelist. Masters of the genre such as Connelley, Lescroart, Burke, etc., work very hard at creating credible characters and credible plots and don't rely on cheap tricks or gimmicks. This book is predictible from page one, the characters are one-dimensional, the plot is ludicrous and this is my first and last Michael Prescott book."
1,Yuck!!!,"I have not played this game,but looking at the screenshots it looks like yet another sidescroller.Sidescrollers,other than crazy drake are (bad)."
4,kim possible,"this is a geat game , but is very easy.i guess it is because im older.so this is probably terrific game for younger kim possible game lovers!!!"
4,"Seductive, tantalizing,","Seductive, tantalizing, and hauntingly beautiful, the Winter women are three of the most gorgeous and ambitious sisters in the world. And each one will capture the heart, for they are as charming as they are competitive, as good as they are corruptible. They started with nothing in a tired coal-mining town in England and conquered the world. From the sophistication of London to the languor of the Caribbean to the fame and power of Hollywood, glamor, glory, and unheard of wealth were theirs. And so was the dreadful secret they unknowingly shared"
5,Love for Layton,"What a delightful anthology this is.I found this collection of charming love poetry tucked away neatly in the miniscule poetry section of my friendly neighborhood chain bookstore, and I couldn't be happier with my luck.There is enough warmth, humor and wry introspection in Layton's poetry to mark each poem as a cornerstone of Canadian literature. It is certainly tempting to label it so myself. Canadian or not -- to pass this up would be criminal, so stop reading and start ordering."
4,Bob Dylan Guitar Instruction DVD,"This DVD has a good selection of Dylan's different guitar styles, and the instructor does a good job of breaking them down and walking you through them step by step. My only complaint is that he goes a little too fast sometimes, and there is no guitar tab displayed on the screen, which a lot of other guitar instruction DVDs have."
1,Save your money!!,Possibly the worst written book I have ever read. Rambling on and on about things the reader couldn't care less about!
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"This was exactly why I was looking for. Received the item in perfect timing, earlier than scheduled which was appreciated."
1,Total Disappointment - Where Is The Killer V-Ball Gameplay??,"Sure, the graphics and CGI are great, but what was TECMO thinking when they created this ""Mature"", volleyball game? All this hype on a spectacular volleyball game only to be teased by a bunch of bouncing jigglies??? At least have a cheat code for Super Spike Volleyball somewhere on the CD!!! Oh well, I guess I will wait for the real volleyball game coming out soon, OUTLAW Volleyball!... I won't buy it until I read the critical reviews, the truth. And not the hyped up [words]printed in those gaming magazines. If you enjoy funabagos, this game is for you. If you are looking for a truly fun and challenging beach volleyball game, pick up a Super Nintendo system and Super Spike Volleyball or Kings of The Beach instead. They are about the same price you would pay for this game. Good luck!"
2,2/5,"I've observed lots of mixed feelings for this game. At the end of the day, I think there's some confusion over the target audience for this game. Details shall be discussed under the Gameplay heading."
4,This is the reason why I bought an XBOX in the first place,"Guilty! I'm a heterosexual female and the first time I played this game, I was just so entertained. The volleyball games are fun and there's a certain ""Sims"" feel to it when you start wooing some of the girls to partner with you on a volleyball match. The graphics are just astounding, but I have to say, replay value is not that high. After buying all the swimsuits and being friends with every girl (Even the one you're inclined to hate e.g. Kasumi and Ayane), there's just no point in playing this over and over again. The graphics (again) just blows you away. This game was a good reason to buy the XBOX."
3,Surprising result,"My first exposure to this game was as a rental. I'm not a big sports game guy. I played it some, got good enough at the volley ball to make lots of Zack Dollars. Enjoyed the realistic ""Physics Engine,"" got bored with it and that would have been the end of it. My wife though couldn't get enough. She said it was like playing with barbi dolls and enjoyed buying suits and trying them on the different characters. I was forced to buy her a copy of the game so she could play it for hours on end, getting new suits for different characters and giving suits to characetrs as gifts so she could see how that character looked in a suit she couldn't buy. It was really sort of sureal. I guess the story here is that women shouldn't write this game off. they may actually enjoy it more then the men who are supposed to be buying it."
1,Is that volleyball made of silicon?,"What do you do when you want to sell a video game about a sport that is about as popular as the XFL? Well just have all the charactors be women with large....volleyball skills and have them wear swimsuits. Considering the target market for this game is teen males 14-25, this will probably be a popular game. But this game should come with a sign for the buyer to wear. The sign would of course read Virgin, in big red letters. For the 50 dollars you'd spend on this game, you could buy some adult entertainment videos and not look as pervy."
3,Average,"Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball is pretty to look at and actually fairly engaging to play for a while but it will run its course fairly quickly for most gamers, especially the obsessive sort who really tries to milk all the depth out of a game. So, in short, rent, don't buy."
2,Don't Buy it For the Chicks,"Granted, this game does have some attrractice girls in it. I'm sure that alone will sway some guys into buying this game but please take my advice and don't. I thought this game was going to be great and after I had played it for about five minutes I realized it [was bad]. The camera is absolutely horrible. You get only an angled view and it is annoying to try and get your girl into place on the court. Most importantly, the game play [is poor]. You serve it and then have a short rally until someone spikes it and wins the point. There is not a whole lot of strategy as you just keep spiking it until the other person can't return it. It will get very old very fast. Do not waste your money. Unless of course the girls are what you are buying it for, not the actual gameplay."
4,AWSOME,This game is awsome you play volleyball play in a casino and much more. It is pretty realistic. this game got the rating it deserved. ... It is a very fun game....
5,Dope Just Like the Last Two,"This is the 3rd installment of Dopegame and i must say that it hasn't lost its touch. The production is sicc and so are the cats that spit fire on every track. This is how a rap cd should be...no intro, outro, or no fillers Just a bunch of songz that equal quality. (like everyone says..it's not quantity it's Quality!) Check this out and you'll be surprised at what people been sleepin through. (Cuz In Da Bay We Don't Get Crunk WE GET HYPHY!) Yadamean!!"
1,Missing Fundamental Explanations,"I am completing my final semester in the Economics Department at the University of Rochester. Looking back over all of the books that I have read as an undergraduate student, this book ranks among the worst three (including books from other disciplines). Coming from a student who will be graduating among the top in his class and continuing on to pursue a PhD in Economics, steer clear of any Microeconomics section requiring this textbook, unless you have an excellent teacher, who you know, will fill in the gaps."
4,Review of Remember,"This was a book needed for one of my writing classes in college. Although it was an interesting book, it was much shorter and not nearly as descriptive as I thought it to be. If there ar eno pages missing, I urge you to buy the cheapest one you can find. The seller was awesome and got here before any of the other books I purchased. Never used Amazon before, but will be sure to use it again since it was so incredibly easy and accurate...."
4,The Word from Mose Allison,"I have been a big fan of Mose for many years, and I thought this CD was delightful"
4,[SWEET],"I just bought this game it is sweet. It is not to hard. The only bad thing is you can't use your lightsaber till level seven.For all of you who like to make it for fun,go to [cheat websites] And get some codes."
3,ok game,This game was an Ok game.Without codes I would say it would be way to hard.Its a fun game at first but you often cant find your way around the levels.Thay expect a little to much.I love to use my lightsavor on games like that but in this game you dont get it till your at the impossibul to get to 7 level.And you have to go through a bunch of mind boggeling task just to get it.But on 2 players this is a pritty fun game.
5,Excelent!,"The swordfight, Oh the swordfight! I hope that Knights of the old republic allows you to fight like that too. This thing alone makes this game a blast."
4,May the Force be with You!,"This is a really good game.I've seen better games than this,but if you're a Star Wars fan it's worth getting.I'm a huge Star Wars fan so I had to get this!One of the few things I don't care for about it is that it is really,really,really hard!That makes it rather boring after a while.I also didn't like that you can't use a light saber at the beginning,you're just some bearded guy with a gun who likes to kill imperial guys.I'm sorry Lucasarts Entertainment,I like the movies better!Go with Lord of the Rings games instead,if I've changed your mind on getting it.It is good,but only good."
3,A split opinion,"I have a split opinion on this game. On one hand it has an awesome two-player action but, on the other hand the one-player style is to confusing and needs a little tuning up."
3,more the man than the music,"Its not as bad as everyone is saying. It has a very extensive history of Van Halen (the band) and their ups and downs. I did not notice any mistakes. The writer is British and uses interesting phrases at times. I appreciate that he gives some opinions or makes some speculations rather than the cold hard facts, and includes quotes from others too. I actually learned a number of little details I didn't know before. There are also a lot of details about Eddie's guitars and their modifcations and other equipment through the years, and there are some decent black and white photos from over the years.The ""play the music"" section is weak I agree. Its geared toward beginners, and most advanced players already know many of the tricks. It does come with CD to accompany the method, and the book is hard bound but with a spiral to lay flat - so thats great.I guess I would sum it by saying this is a good book about Van Halen but not a definite advanced study on his technique."
3,a significant factual error,"Kingsbury makes a not uncommon error when she claims the British army suffered 58,000 men killed in action on 1 July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme. In fact, she has confused total casualties with killed in action. About 19,000 British troops were killed on the Somme 1 July 16; total casualties (killed, wounded, and missing) equalled approximately 58,000."
1,Contra: Shattered Soldier,"I was somewhat disappointed when I bought this game. After hearing that this was one of the more difficult games for PS2, I expected a very fast, exciting, and well developed game. Contra is not that kind of game. If I wanted a 2D game, I could have gotten a SNES game. The only movements you can make are forward, back, jump, crouch. What a waste of PS2's graphic power. The gameplay is anything but entertaining. Basically, you play the mission until you come to something you have never seen before. It kills you. You restart the mission and kill it. This cycle goes on for the rest of the mission."
1,Hard to read,The numbers on the dial are small and hard to read with normal lighting. Digital and/or luminous or lit dials would be helpful.
2,"1/3 of book related to Weblogic features, 2/3 J2EE,JSP,...","This book is trying to cover many things (see contents) The only problem is that the examples provided do not work, due to inconsistencies or worse due to code errors. No code correction available on line. You are left to fend for yourself to get them working if you can! A beginner will not be able to get those the examples working. I would not recommend this book to a beginner."
2,Very low quality,"This book is a really poor text even for an introduction like the ""teach yourself..."" series. Theory is absent and confusing,and the example code are so disgusting they made a few of my hair go white! I am gonna sue Sams for that! ;)I absolutely do not recommend this text for someone new toservlets jsp and ejbs.. if this is your first approach to the subject I doubt you will be ever able to recover!! It might be useful to someone who can already make sense of j2ee and wants a quick and dirty introduction on getting started with weblogic, but I would recommend a more solid and technically valid text."
4,Shooter fans will love this!,"First of all, this game is great. If you liked the movies, you will have a blast relating to the humor and storlyine conections, as well as aliens from MIB II. It really feels like a 3D Contra game, however, which is great. A wide selection of guns, exciting levels, and awesome control. The difficulty is on the challenging side, but it is not as difficult as the average Contra game. Aiming is fairly easy, but it fits the game perfectly. Yes, this is the same game that is on PS2, and not much hs changed. Graphics are a litle more detailed, the framerate is smoother, and levels have an extra room or power-up here and there. However, it is not worth buying again if you own it on PS2. Action gamers will love it, as this is a pure adrenaline rush. Slightly better than the PS2 version."
1,Inane (stupid) game,"This is a video shooting gallery, and nothing else. Not really playing a game, nothing to figure out, or find, just shooting as fast as you can as enemies pop up. And they are WAY more powerful than you and you die quickly and often--and have to start ALL over from the beginning of the level every time. I played it for a few hours and only got to the second level--and I'm an experienced gamer.I don't recommend this game for serious video gamers--unless you need some target practice for your other games."
5,Quality sock,I was tires of leaving sock shedding all over. These socks do not shed and are wearing very well after several months.
2,Comfortable but not long-lasting,"I was looking to find some high quality socks that would last for a few years (like the old style wigwam cotton socks; NOT the low quality stuff wigwam is selling now) instead of weeks or months. Thus, I tried the grey style Gold Toe socks and the first pair shows holes after a few weeks. They are certainly comfortable but seem otherwise average. Taken into a account the higher than average price this results in only two stars."
3,Just Average Socks,"I don't know why these socks were $14 for a 3 pack. They don't seem much better than what I can get at wallyworld and pay less than 1/2. Oh well, they do fit my size 13 feet pretty well."
3,"Good DVD, routines a little long for a beginner",I like the DVD but for a beginner the routines are pretty long and get hard. I had to order another DVD and this time I made sure they had a bunch of shorter routines. I did like the leader and how he instructed you was good.
2,easy and goofy,"This workout was very easy,I did not even sweat.If you are looking for a power Yoga dvd try Baron Baptiste Yoga collection."
5,BRYAN KEST POWER YOGA,"This provides a very good work out, good flow etc. Bryan is cute...so I got a chuckle out of the shots showing him in jeans posing and looking into the camera as he was walking ostensibly into his studio...it was un-necessary ""fluff"" but the work out, his words, the folks demonstrating the poses were all top shelf."
4,get past his hair and you'll love it,"even though Kest is a little corn-y with his long, flowing hair, cut-off jeans, no shirt, and his occasional soap-box preaching of yoga virtues, the practice is very good, nice and complete. I like the idea of being able to work at different levels within the same sequences of poses, and his philosophy of no perfect pose-- we are not trying to get there, we are trying to BE HERE-- these things are very important and often left out of yoga workouts, presumably because people are more worried about weight loss etc. The three workouts definitly feel like real astanga yoga to me, not those silly impersonations. I alternate between Kest and Rodney Yee's power or strength and energy."
4,Bryan Kest power yoga,"This is a great CD. Bryan is engaging. At first I was put off because their is a lot of talking and ego stroking happening at the front. But once you get into the workout, it's great. I like the style of it being taught in a class with him moving about. There's an attempt at being arty that kind of bugged me at first, but then I realized it's from LA so of course it would be like that.If you have a clue about a yoga practices this is a great choice with 3 works or combined 90 minute. As I mentioned Bryan grows on you and actually becomes very soothing and someone what sexy as in he is differently connecting honestly with his audience."
3,What's with the music?,"I like the yoga sequences in this DVD I find them chanllanging, and invigorating. However, the first 2 sequences ""energize"" and ""tone"" are very similar, ""tone"" just inlcudes a little more standing balance exercies. I like the the third sequence the best, ""sweat"", which inclues partial headstand and arm balance exercies.The one thing I don't like about this DVD is the music. It sounds like music from a bad 80s action movie."
3,"Good power yoga, but I've seen better","I just bought this DVD. I tried the third segment and I liked it, however 1) I feel some of the poses were held too long and 2) The people in the class were super advanced yoga students and some of their movements were a little unrealistic (over extending backwards for example) because most people (even if practicing for years) cannot reach this level of flexibility. It would have been nice to see students who were more ""average/a bit advanced."" I really like the Rodney Yee videos. However, I am holding on to this DVD to keep my routines varied and keep things more interesting."
1,who does yoga in tight cut-off jeans ?,"it was more talk then action. he spoke sooo much and sooo loudly i couldn't even get into the dvd. his students did the poses, and he had close body contact to his students in ""helping"" them pose right. the times that he did do yoga seemed more like showing off then demonstrating. if i ever walked into his studio seeing him wearing greasy 80's hair and tight cut-off jeans, i would have ran the other way never looking back. im sorry i wasted my $7.00.sigh."
1,Just Awful,"Bryan Kest is a terrible Yoga instructor. Yoga is supposed to be relaxing, and he talks throughout the entirety of the DVD. I just wanted him to shut up. He is also shirtless and looks like a dumb hippie. His workout out is nothing like P90X Yoga. P90X Yoga looks professional, is soothing, and gets you into shape. Bryan Kest's workout is run of the mill, not soothing, and not worth the money."
4,ecstatically relaxed,"This DVD set is awesome. I have never done yoga before this, its easy to catch on and get in with the flow, it is awesome. I have been doing the video for about a month now and I have definately seen improvement in my strength. Most of all i see more definition in my shoulders and legs. It has given me the energy to pursue other activities, as well."
4,yoga man,"Good workout, but, at the begining of the workout there is some time wasted on needless video of Bryan. Some of the commentary by Bryan is a bit ""over the top"" on the philosophy. The video could be improved by just getting into the workouts and fast and effective teaching of the proper form. Other than these items, this workout is good, and I always feel good physically after the session. I would buy this DVD again."
2,couldn't get past his voice,"Well, I can't speak to Bryan's great cueing or his holding poses for the right amount of time. This is because I was so put off by his voice that it was impossible to continue. Imagine a grating, annoying, nasal voice telling you ad nauseum how important breathing is..."" And you gawda remembah that da breath is very impooortent..."" I applaud the others for braving that for a workout. But I couldn't do it. I wish someone had mentioned this in a review before I bought 2 of his DVD's. I returned both Bryan Kest DVD's the same day!"
1,awful,I'm not happy with this DVD at all first the DVD skipped throughout the work out. I cleaned the DVD and still had the same problems. 2nd the narration was off que (for me at least) I'm not pleased at all with this DVD and willmost liekly re-sell it.
1,"This is a ""look at me"" video, not a ""how to ""!!!","This Yoga tape is ridiculous! You may as well sit on the couch and watch it b/c it's impossible to learn anything from it! You either see a group of people huddled together, so that you can't make out what they are doing, or there is a close up on someone so that you only see a portion of them; either way, you can't figure out what you are supposed to be doing! I've since purchased some (less expensive!) tapes from the Living Yoga series & they are much better. You only have one person to watch, & they are more focused on the yoga than on camera angles so it is much easier to learn. Brian Kest- your ""be where you're at"" was a good idea, but you blew it!"
2,more variety please,"This video is less boring than Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, but still could stand more variety. I love yoga, but found this to be fairly boring. It is challenging and a pleasure to watch."
3,he never shuts up!!![...],"I was pleased to see volumes 2 and 3 of the power yoga series at my local library so I could try them out before shelling out any money. I don't think that I'm going to buy these tapes because there is far too much talking. bryan runs a constant (and i do mean constant) monologue throughout the entire tape. i find his voice to be jarring to my practice and very unnecessary. he parades around shirtless wearing jeans or cotton pants as he talks and talks and talks. the whole tape is a very glossy performance - i'm not surprised that his studio's based in Santa Monica. pretty people, pretty bryan. aside from this - the yoga's okay - lots of sun saluations, warrior poses... but there's something lacking. i prefer david swenson's ashtanga yoga short forms video."
3,"""Leave the kids alone!""","A real mixed bag, some people might say. Anyone unfamiliar with the Alice shorts and any or all cartoons in the collection are in for a treat. The Alice Shorts sort give a visual genesis of Walt Disney's Empire. Even though all of them are not in this collection, there's enough of 'em to move onto some cartoons one might be more familiar with. Such as Lamber the Sheepish Lion, Chicken Little, the Humphrey the Bear cartoons, ect. Then there are some ""experimental"" cartoons and shorts that are not to be overlooked.It has been noted that the metal tin the the 2-disc set it protects has become cheaper looking. The back cover info on the tin is now a detatched piece of hard-paper. And the cartoons and shorts don't look like they've had the same restoration some of the other sets have had(the Donald Duck Vol. 2 set had a few cartoons that looked visually dirty & dark). Still, it deserves our indulgence, there is some genius to be found on these discs."
2,Sad and disappointed,"I have all 18 of the Disney Treasure DVD's. Until this year, they have been of excellent quality. However, this year, with Disney Rarities and the Chronilogical Donald, Vol 2, I was very disappointed.The selection of material, in both the new additions, is exemplary, as usual. The quality of that material, however, is what leads to this poor review. Most of the material looks like it was untouched, and certainly not remastered as the packaging would suggest, before being transferred to DVD. Given the unforgiving nature of the medium, the material really looks poor. So poor that it takes away from any value this set might have had to a collector, and poor enough that even a casual viewer is going to be left unsatisfied."
4,Pretty Good ALBUM by Ludacris & DTP,"This album, was pretty good, it had some nice beats, rhymes, and the skits were off the chain. Shawnna really did her thang with the song ""Posted"" which is one of my favorites on the CD. SO I suggest if you're a real Ludacris & DTP fan, then you should cop this album right now! You ain't heard nothing YET, until you get this CD!"
4,Great CD,"this is definitly one of the greatest CD's in my collection, and if u buy it (which you should), it will be one of your favorites as well. My favorite song has to be R.P.M. ft. shawna and twista. This song has a nice fast past to it that u are sure to love. This CD wasn't as good as Word of Mouf, but still a great Cd by itself."
5,Some Practical Magic,What a great book. I loved every magic moment that I spent reading it. The characters were great and the story line fantastic. I can't wait to get the sequal and read that one as well.
5,Student textbook,"I am just a simple guy that is trying to save a little money by repairing my own cars. I've done fairly well so far, so I wanted to try and learn to be a bit more precise in what I do and try to have the knowledge of a mechanic while still keeping my day job. I found that this book really fit the bill.I think it should be mentioned that this is essentially a student textbook, with review questions and a point of view that you're working towards becoming a mechanic after ""graduating"". Considering that I never took an automotive class while in high school, this was perfect for me. However, this information might be overly simplistic to someone else that may have had prior training. Since I don't know what all the tools and parts are called, this was perfect. What anyone can appreciate is the high quality of the glossy pages and vibrant color of this textbook format. You might even wonder if you forgot to finish your homework that is due tomorrow!"
4,Worth forcing yourself to listen to.,"Excellent soundtrack by Howard Shore featuring Ornette Coleman. The music is extremely moody, and not easy to focus on. In the film, the music often seems to be coming from the apartment next door, almost as natural sounds. Music has a beat generation feel to it, not a modern update. Recommended."
1,"Terrific on PC, terrible on XBox.","Perhaps I've been spoiled by Halo, but this particular game for the XBox seemed absolutely terrible in comparison. One of the main failings of this game are that there simply too many powers, guns, and equipment items to cram into a hand-held controller. The controls are awkward and therefore it becomes difficult to achieve the same level of gameplay that one enjoyed on the PC.Additionally, the graphics did not seem tailored to the XBox. The health bar was too small to read clearly, the ""use"" signal much too small, and overall the superior video capabilities of the XBox were under-utilized.At best, the game is mediocre but the ""Star Wars"" brand name stamped upon it will ensure that it will sell well (much like the movies)."
5,Lots of laughs,Psych is the program to watch if you need to laugh and to laugh often. Good clean fun!
5,The perfect fighting game!,"I really enjoyed playing this game on the ps2 and i didn't even play it that much when it barely came out in the arcades around the year 2000, i had no idea how great this game would be even after more than 10 years after it's original arcade release! To be honest this version is okay but for tournament play i suggest the dreamcast version instead, although most tournaments won't be holding tournaments for this game anymore unless they're underground type tournaments or just for fun."
3,"Good football game but too complicated,,,,","Disney football is a good football game including those wonderful Disney character(Goofy,Donald) are in playing an excellent sport except the controls and movements are to hard to manuver. It is definitly not better than Backyard football but better than some madden games including the one in 95'..."
5,"Great, Great Sound","This sub is really great. You can feel his presence. From the bottom, a rich and clear sound by the cross over adjustment and the gain. Excellent choice one of the best image I had ever seen."
4,All you wanted to see...,"All the videos of the first Chili Peppers' decade... A must for the fans! Including: fight like a brave, behind the sun, taste the pain, knock me down and tons of others! Really, if you can get it somewhere, it worth it."
5,Witty and Biting,"Snobs is that rare book, one that is truly funny, delightfully, bitingly funny. The nameless narrator tells the story of Edith Lavery, a beautiful young woman who marries up, up into the world of the British aristocratic royalty. And of course, they are all snobs, for the most part, and the narrator fills us in on every delicious detail. The novel is full of many witty, wry one liners and has a halfway decent plot to boot. The story line isn't anything new, but that's not the point. Snobs is a lot of fun to read and chuckle at and frankly, made me happy I don't have to contend with the snobs of England. Very smartly written, very well done. Enjoy."
3,Watch MONARCH OF THE GLEN instead,"SNOBS misses the mark. While it is insightful vis-a-vis the English upper classes, the humorous moments are few and far between, and the writing is uneven. Instead of SNOBS, try watching MONARCH OF THE GLEN, the poignant and charming BBC saga about the trials and tribulations of a relucatant Scottish laird, in which author Julian Fellowes has a recurring role. That would be time and money better spent."
2,"Not so funny, racist, classist, mysogonistic view . . .","Not so funny stuff done far better by other English authors (Wodehouse, etc.) told as semi-autobiograical memoir. (Written in first person by ""actor"" from an aristocratic background (which is an actual description of author). Jews are described and ""loud talking"". There is an underlying polemic which attacks abortion and supports ""blood sports"" (rather disgusting English hunting practices). With few exceptions in Mr. Fellowes world, women are either very silly and concerned about how many duchesses they know, or much more importantly having children. Yes it is supposed to be ironic, but underneath the mild comedy is a very parochial, conservative viewpoint. Mr. Fellowes, in addition to his show business work, writes speaches for the Conservative party in Great Britain, and, one suspects, would much prefer the days while there were few non-white citizens, and the Peerage controlled all. . . . left a yucky taste."
5,"A modern day ""House of Mirth""","Snobs is one of the best novels I've read in years. The heroine is torn between a hunky actor with no money or status, and a boring Earl that can give her the comfort and stability (not to mention the title) that she so desperately desires. A modern-dayThe House of Mirth (Dover Thrift Editions)"
4,good insight into human nature!,"The author here has an uncanny ability to describe precisely certain emotions in a way that no one else can. The story is good but the writing and the author's uncanny knack of delving into and putting into words people's motivations, psyches and mindsets is the most interesting aspect of this book"
5,Huh?,"I just finished this book and I found it to be well written, comprehensive, and incredibly informative and up to the minute in terms of the vulnerabilities covered. I specialize in SQL security and I'm not sure if the negative reviewer below actually read this chapter. He complains the SQL chapter: ""...mentions nothing about port blocking which is the first thing I would do. UDP Port 1434 really has no purpose and should be blocked..."" The following is from page 637 of the SQL chapter in Special Ops: ""It cannot be stressed enough just how important it is to either apply this patch [from MS] or block all UDP 1434 inbound to the server."" It's a great book and I don't think people should be turned off by incorrect criticsisms."
4,good but not the best,"all the songs are pretty good except track 4. that song is horrible. the background vocals are dumb as dogs. this album is melodic and fast, much faster than their previous records. i recommend this if you like melodic death metal and don't mind one bad song. pretty good. b+"
2,Hypocrisy's miss o' the day,"As times have moved on, Hypocrisy has been a hit-or-miss outfit. While my general rating may be a little low as I enjoy some of the tunes here, Tatgren and Co. seem to be lacking their usual flair and love of diversity. It almost sounds as if they tried a bit too hard to capture the love of your typical extreme metal fan. Some of the songwriting is significantly lacking for this album, as well; most notably with their thrashy tune ""Unleash the Beast"", which runs for 5 minutes and contains a total of three riffs (one being a short transitional run). Old-school Hypocrisy fans may be pleased, but ""Into the Abyss"" is a little too bland compared to past releases ""Abducted"" and the eponymous album."
5,The best cookbook yet,I think that this cookbook is one of the best that I have seen yet. I love Vidalia Onions and I think there should be more cookbooks mainly specified on them. If you get this book try the recipes that sound good to your liking and I'm sure you'll love the food that you can come up with.
4,Program Defect,I really like this timeclock but on the digital display when it goes past midnite 12:00 the next time is 0:01AM instead of 12:01 AM. This was on the initial order and the one that I received in exchange. So the same problem exists on all ot these timeclocks.
1,I'm returning this.....,I can't get this time clock to program at all....it's way too complicated and I just want something practical for my small office..I am sending this back
3,Super Bowl Games,"Well it is not what I thought it would be. I was expecting the actual broadcast of the game, not just seeing the highlights....That was disappointing."
2,BE AWARE,"BE AWARE that you only receive 1 jar of sauce, not 4. The picture of 4 jars is very misleading. I received my order today and paid a premium price plus shipping for 5 various jars of products. Will let you know if it's worth the price after I try it."
1,"If you have the DC version, dont bother.","I bought it looking for somethin new in the game. I found nothing. The pixels look better and the game play is smoother but nothing new. No xbox live, no new characters, no new options. If you own the Dreamcast version stick with it."
1,one reason to hold on to your dreamcast!!!!,"after renting this game to my dismay i found ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING new or different about this port.the graphics are the same as it was 3 years ago on the defunct sega dreamcast.what's worse..no online option and you can't play your own souindtracks to replace the horrible jazz ecentric BGM during the battle stages. the music was MUCH MUCH better on capcom's previous efforts I.E. MARVEL SUPER HEROES, MARVEL VS CAPCOM OR EVEM XMEN VS STREET FIGHTER (heh, no wonder why i still have my SEGA SATURN as well as my DC)but if the XBOX is your only system then your'e left with only one option buy it, otherwise avoid..btw where's the gamecube version...oh you mean there isn't one for the lamecube??...oops!"
1,cracked in less than a week,"We installed it on Thurs and by the weekend it had cracked. On the positive side, it was easy to install and easy to remove."
4,quick fix,"there were 2 holes in our shower where i assume the original hot/cold knobs were almost placed. You could see right in at anyone showering, it was awful. So i ordered these to fix the problem. They fit perfectly and we no longer have to be afraid to showeri would recommend this item, it is a great buy."
4,Love Spin and Marty!,"Love my ""Disney Treasure"" - Adventures of Spin and Marty. All arrived in superior condition and I watch it over and over again....thanks...."
2,Poor Quality Audio,"I purchased this recorder to take to a writer's seminar in February 2005 in which I hoped to record the speaker instead of taking notes by hand. The recorder picked up every noise near me - my legs crossing, feet shuffling, the lady next to me coughing - it is so sensitive that it picked up so much next-to-me noise that the speaker's voice was inaudible (she was only 4 rows away in a small room).I also tried using the recorder on my own dictation, and it was audible, but with a lot of background noise again. I'm not super picky about products, but really am disappointed with this one."
5,This thing is really cool!,"I bought the ICD-P28 about two months ago. Since then, I have used it extensively, and I love it! My main concern when I bought it was whether or not I would be able to easily transfer the audio files to my PC. As long as you use the software provided, it could not possibly be any easier! I was also worried that it would only transfer them in some obscure format, but it easily transfers and converts the files into .wav files.The quality of the recordings is also much better than I suspected from such a small ""novelty-like"" recorder!I am just totally pleased with this thing!!"
4,This Game is Awesome I Love it!,I Gave it 4 stars overall because it is kinda pricey. I love makin movies so I thought it was worth it! Lots of fun. It's kind of a cross between The Sims and Windows Movie Maker.
1,Stay Away from this Pathetic Game,"I bought this game just after Christmas. It stinks. This is not a good simulation game at all. Firstly, most computers won't be able to run this game. It installs poorly, has frequent crashes when trying to launch the game, and the customer service is non-existent.The pathetic help menu is of no help at all, and the game offers you an opportunity, after crashing, to read the ReadMe File. Thanks...big help. Try the BiteMe File, instead.Once the game is finally installed, you'll find it's a time-consuming bore. Micromanaging everything down to the characters' bathroom breaks is not at all fun, and you'll soon be very sorry you wasted your time, money, and enthusiasm on such a pathetic piece of software.Keep looking for a fun, simulation business game. It's not here."
3,system requirements,"My boyfriend got this for me for Christmas, however he didn't check all the system requirements before he bought it. Do this!!! My computer is 4 yrs. old and had to update graphics that are DirectX 9.0 compatible."
3,mp3 for u and me,"Jimmy is a talented singer and guitarist and we've all heard his silly little acoustic songs he sings on SNL. Charming. However, this CD is full of stand-up comedy and the only standouts are Idiot Boyfriend (the video is classic) and Troll Doll Jingles (though his Halloween songs are much better)..."
4,Suikoden,"hey i dunno about 3 but the other 2 games were great you get over 108 playable characters there are tons of side quests lots of hidden magic\runes you can lead entire armys, u even get your own castle to do with as you please....basicly this is one of the greatest series games ever made!!!!"
2,Battle system is teh sux0rz...,"The story is interesting enough I suppose but do I ever hate the battle system and the forced camera angles as you move around. The battle system and the camera angles ruined the whole game for me, I couldn't play it...and having a donald duckesque character as my body guard really doesn't help me take this game any more seriously. I am a huge fan of Suikoden 1 and 2 and this game ended up disappointing me to the point of wanting to stay far far away from any new Suikoden releases."
2,Farewell Summer,"After reading Ladies of the Club, I expected this book to be of similar quality.I was disappointed. It never really developed into an interesting story. It was also very short whichI feel should have been noted by Amazon in the description."
5,The best way to make a drink-PERIOD!,"To me this is the best way to make a green powder drink or any other powdered drink for that matter. Super fast, works perfectly and very easy to clean. This is one of my favorite things in the world!!!Scott"
5,Simply splendid ! HORIZONTAL FALL,"GERRY BECKLEY of the group AMERICA has released a solo set of songs, 15 total. GERRY has written such classic gems as SISTER GOLDEN HAIR, I NEED YOU, DAISY JANE, MOVING TRAIN, PLAYING GOD, NOW SUE & SARAH among hundreds. The songs here are quite splendid.? GERRY touches upon many subjects & uses a variety of musical instruments to get his message across. His genius is readily apparent in such cuts as WARM GONE GRAY, SATURDAY SKY, THE FARMER IS THE MAN. He continues to produce songs that are pleasing melodically, musically & lyrically to everyday folks. His wide expanse of subject matter & musical wizardry combine to bring magical sounds of peace & love. His messages are clear, his feelings are real. Please give this one a close listen."
2,Stick with the Original,"Well I was taking LS7 for a while with good results, so I figured I would bump it up a little with this version. It was a bit of a disappointment, I would suggest the original formula but this one was missing some of the thermogenic effect I enjoyed from the original formula and was packed with too much caffeine. I wouldn't waste my money on this version."
4,Movie: This is England,"This movie is iteresting and strange, somewhat sick and twisted. Its about a kid who falls in with the ""wrong crowd"" of which he is significantly younger than. It's almost like an English version of the movie Kids... If you like Kids, American History X, Made in Brittain, Gummo, Requiem for a Dream, Pallindromes, Alpha Dogs and other such movies you will enjoy this movie!"
1,My item never arrived!!,"I ordered this item for a friends birthday from iNetVideo and after 3 weeks I wrote to them. It took 2 e-mails for a response and then when i finally recieved a response they just said to 'Please be patient for your order, it takes 4-6 weeks for items to be shipped'. Even though I had recieved an e-mail saying that my item had been shipped 2 days after ordering it on Amazon. I have not recieved any other information."
2,"Too much talking, choppy and amateurish. Good try though.","Based on the filmmaker's own experience in a working class English neighborhood in the 1980s, this is the story of an 11 year old boy who is befriended by a bunch of skinheads. There was a bit of violence and some good acting but there was much too much talking. Even though it had a some emotional impact, I found it rather choppy and amateurish. I also found it hard to understand the English accents and think that there should have been subtitles for an American audience. The directors and one of the actors spoke with the audience later but even though I applaud them for trying, I would not recommend this film."
4,Interesting read!,I'm studying Canadian Literature and this book is great because it provided me with the interesting facts of Canada and its short but lively history. Anyone thinking about working and living there or just going there for a holiday can read this book and discover the amazing history behind Canada's diverse and mulitcultural population. It has many index resources for anyone wishing to know the 'hard facts'.The book is apart of a series of traveller's guides which seem to give readers interesting facts without boring them!! I was initially tempted to buy this book because it was written from a traveller's perspective. Having purchased it from Amazon I am delighted with its light and story-like style which makes it very enjoyable to read.
5,Minimal soundtrack but very sublime,"I had to order this soundtrack from Europe. The music tracks are short but they are different with each decalogue. The instruments used are mostly piano, violin, and flute. The best tracks are of decalogue 1 and 8. 1 is very sad and bleak. 8 is operatic and more grandeur. Overall, a very unique soundtrack."
3,"Works good, but now I have 2 half-cats","A little too strong. Played with my cat, but it cut him directly in half. Now he.. well, they rather, won't play with it because they can't walk. (Yes it's great for the kitties).;)"
2,Fun for the cats,"The cats have a ball with these, but they're definitely not high quality, but you get what you pay for. I received a pack of 2 and one of them didn't work. The company I ordered them from promptly sent a replacement though. All in all, a pretty good value for the money."
5,Great for warmth,"I got these to go under my regular pants during the day, because my legs get cold. They certainly are great at giving me a little extra heat during the day. And they fit well under my dress pants, which is key."
3,Well Made,"These shorts are very well made. I ordered an extra large and it was too tight in the waist, I have a large stomach and I weigh 170 pounds. I am hoping to lose some more weight to fit them but I am thinking of returning them because I needed something that is not as binding and of a lighter material. I should not have ordered biker shorts because I do not ride bikes. I needed a simple short that is 9"". I am giving them 3 stars only because they weren't for me, but I would give them 5 stars for some one else."
5,Great for workout,I just bought these shorts for running. I had some Under armor shorts but they were too short and my shorts would rub on my leg so I ordered these. I wear them for volleyball and biking. They not only provide protection (they come down to my knee) and dryness but they are also well made. I don't see them falling apart any time soon.
3,Good fit..waistline is tight tho!,"The shorts are good length and the fabric is soft on the skin. However, the waistband is a bit tighter than I thought it should be. I felt like I was wearing a pair of slacks rather than exercise shorts."
2,Not worth the money,"Hello,I have this headset for more then 3 years and use it often, but for that money I should have bought some another. It is ok for voip, but not for music.The most annoying thing is that when you move your head with headset on, you will hear cracking sound of plastics joints. This sound comes from multiple joints unit have. Due to the joints, it is very adjustable, but the price for it is this cracking sound.Another thing is that volume control broke after 2 years and one earpiece is often muted.What is good about this headset is that they are portable as they are light and can be assembled in a flat shape so they don't take too much space in your bag."
3,kind of OK thingy,"Got two bluetooth headsets which i keep forgetting to recharge and decided to go for a low cost headset. the delivery was fast, on using it, well.. some gripes and some goodies..goodies: lightweight, 0 effort installation(for me atleast on winxp - plug in, wait for drivers, continue).. audio is good quality in comparison to my bluetooth(logitech and plantronics), i can use it with my mp3 player if i like to. and i can choose to plug in my desktop speakers to the USB connector and use the mic alone.. so lots of combi..gripes: the speakers and mic connector is slightly fragile - so need to be careful.. twisting the speakers to fit into the box kinda stumped my wife who has a weak wrist, and the jacks to push the audio/mic connectors need to completely pressed.. cant they have put a simple detect logic to enable disable the output and mic paths based on socket plugin?Did not try this with my PS2 yet..so dunno abt it.."
5,Very nice,"When our company decided to start using Skype for conference calls, we were each given a cheap headset. I couldn't get mine to work half the time on my laptop, and on both my laptop and desktop the sound quality was terrible. Santa brought me one of these (they were under $30 at the time), and I've been very happy with them. Just out of curiosity, I tested the old headset with the USB plug that came with this one, and I immediately had far better quality. Then I used this headset with its plug and the quality improved even further.Some people have complained that it doesn't fit well with their eyeglasses, but I haven't noticed any problem with mine. In fact, it fits much better than any of the over-the-head headphones that I've tried. It probably depends on the style; my glasses don't wrap around behind my ear.If you're suffering with mediocre- or low-quality sound because your computer has a low-end sound card, I'd highly recommend this product, especially if you can get it for under $30."
2,Loditech around head headset,The very long chord is cumbersome. The product itself is NOT very light. The overall quality was pretty good. Noise cancellation etc. The reason for the deduction of starts was due to it NOT being adjustable (as a geadset that's pretty important). So if you have a head that's small it will not work for you as it will just droop in the back & weigh down your ears instead of being supported by the back of your head. I had to return this item & lost money on shipping (both ways) and a 15% restocking fee (avoid AOnline as a company to purchase from their customer service is lacking).
2,mediocre sound quality,"These are just ""OK"" or average and I would compare the sound quality listening to music or voice (skype) as equal to several other $10 to $20 headsets that I have used. I have not adequately tested the microphone with Dragon dictation yet as my Dragon software will not run on my current Win 7 64 bit computer. Overall a disappointment considering the list price and Logitech brand."
3,Almost as good as I wanted it to be.,"The headphones fit quite nicely. They are adjustable so I can change the way they sit whenever they grow uncomfortable. They come with the lovely hard case to carry them. It is a little big and bulky, but keeps the headphones protected. My one big issue is the microphone. It does not pick up sound very well. I use it for World of Warcraft, and with all of the volumes turned up, I still had to shout to be heard. The microphone just doesn't reach around to the front of my mouth, so the sound is not aimed at it. Good idea, poorly executed."
5,Works well with Dragon 11.5,"I recently upgraded to Dragon 11.5. With my previous version of Dragon, I used a very expensive (over $300) stylus microphone. I was not pleased with the speed nor the accuracy, so I actually stopped using Dragon. I read a positive review of this Logitech notebook headset, and decided that, for around $80, it was worth a try (I already traded away my stylus microphone). I have been VERY pleased with the combination of this microphone, and Dragon 11.5. I use it for medical dictation (even though I don't have the ""medical"" version of Dragon). The dictation is fast and accurate. I like the headset (versus the handheld) because the microphone is always well-positioned, and my hands are free to use the keyboard."
4,Rent and enjoy,"OK, this is probably one of the FUNNEST games I have ever played. The graphics rule, especially in the cut scenes. Its not bad (besides the fact that ther arent any checkpoints) to die and start the level over because going through levels is fun as...and cool too. Also, the gameplay and the cool moves you do are easier tham they look, like in Sly Cooper. Im a pretty good and serious gamer but im not the best so this may not concern you, but this game gets HARD. The levels take a while to complete, and the fact that they are monotonous doesnt really push you to do it again. Once youve beaten stage 4-A, the bosses get pretty much impossible. tHIS AINT NO BUY GAME, SO RENT and enjoy."
1,Boring!,"Whatever happened to the Shinobi plotlines in the old Genesis games such as Shadow Dancer, Legend of Shinobi and Shinobi III? What happened to Joe Mushasi and his faithful dog sidekick? What about the evil Union Lizard Corp? None of that is in this. It's just generic hokum and the Ninja dude is the only one to save the day.The graphics are very cool and the soundtrack amiable enough but the gameplay is so boring and gets very old and tired even by the second stage. It was cool slicing the bad folks in half the first few times but when the game takes time out to show them spurting blood for the fifty-millionth time it seriously gets on your nerves.There's no variance or long-lasting appeal to this. It makes me long for the old-school Shinobi. Side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as Shadow Dancer are still better than this. It's very dull. It looks good but it plays poorly."
5,Soooo comfortable...,"I've now had this pillow for a year and it is still fantastic. I used to have a stiff neck every morning, but now that is not the case. I would highly recommend it!"
4,Short Short Selling,"I guess I can't blame the author. There really isn't much to short selling a stock. If you want to know what short selling is or how to do it, you'll learn how to do it in 30 min. Buyer beware... please supplement this book with additional information. If you short sell a stock, you are basically saying that the company you're shorting is going to lose value. With enough company, you can take GE to under $6 a share or Citibank to a penny stock. Why bet on a company to fail? Instead, use the info in this book to learn how to beat the short sellers and buy GE at $6 before it doubles in a couple weeks or Citibank quadruples. Be a bull."
1,Are you a crytographer????,"... Then maybe YOU can make sense of this book. C++ has some different syntax, some of which is not explained in this book until after chapter 5 (& - the pass by refererence operator for example) -- meanwhile the author gives examples using this unique syntax for over one hundred pages. In addition, my fingers got sore from flipping through all the cross references (See my final comment) It seems to me a well written book would explain something and then build on that knowledge. Instead this book relies on cross referencing that can loose someone new to c++ in seconds flat. Do yourself a favor and find another book.( this is a significantly less irritating example of the silly references riddling this poorly written book.)"
2,Probably not the best,"I examined this book for a university class I teach on C++ for Java programmers. I decided not to use it for some of the same reasons cited by other reviewers. The book tends to dive into minutiae, and fails to explain some important ideas clearly. There's a chapter, for instance, on operator overloading, which is an important C++ feature lacking in Java. But the chapter dives into a discussion of operator overloading in a tone that seems to expect that the reader already understands the concept. The chapter doesn't begin with a clear explanation, nor offer one later. Instead, it starts with an obscure example involving comma operators, which no one uses."
3,I miss the 'Mats too but...,"This isn't a bad record and it's certainly a lot better than a couple of albums Chris Mars and Slim have put out over the years. However, except for ""Miss Self-Esteem"" and the ""Crocodile Rock"" cover hidden on the last track, these songs really didn't move me. Come on, Tommy. Bring back Bash and Pop!"
3,smells too sweet,"The spray works all right. The scent is coconutty smell, which I feel is too sweet and kind of strong and nauseating."
1,Contra Advance: The Alien Wars,"Do Not Buy This Game.... not like the original SNES version. It is also way too hard. Their is just way too much going on for such a small screen, you cant help but get disoriented. This game should of never been made for game boy. On a big screen with a real controller, yeah it would totally be cool."
3,Fun and funky,"Are these guys English? Good follow up to 'Its great,.."" but are these guys straight? Ryder's mob does it again with thick and groovy sounds strung around strange (cryptic?) lyrics. From the get go, you ears are warped into the minds of Black Grape; funky bass, offbeat lyrics, asymetrical guitars and sampling (are those turntables?) and you either enjoy the chaotic joy of being sloppy and baggy or you look for the quickest way out. Thumbs up for creativity; thumbs down for engineering, sometimes it does blend to mush but doesn't always at three a.m.?"
2,Soft-sided plastic,"Was disappointed to find out that these boxes are made of a soft plastic. I'm using them - they are colorful and I don't need to open them too often, but they're definitely not super sturdy."
4,Spyro is a classic!!!,"If anyone hasn't played the newest Spyro I really recommend you should. There are great new features. The best has to be his added breath options. There are a few to chose from: fire, ice, bubbles and electric. The visual design of the game is also stellar. The graphics rock. I hope that future Spyro games are this good."
1,this game is the pitt's,"wow this game is the end to the spyro line. It lacks entertainment value,its hard to master the controls,and its also a rip off of a good 20-30 some dollars. if it was my oppinion i would discontinue the game, becausethis game really is a stinker!"
3,Could of been better,Well When i first played Spyro for the playstation I thought It was pretty good. So When i got my Gc and this game came out i said ok ill get it. I have never been so disapinted with a game in my life. The game Doesnt take advantage of the Gamecube at all. The game is not smooth the game is really choppy and full of bugs. If you are a hardcore spyro fan then get it. But if you are just looking for a fun game forget this one. get Mech assault or metroid prime .
2,Not as good as the previous Spyros,"I own all the spyro games and this one was no where near as hard as the rest of them. The only thing that was better than previous Spyros was the graphics. The game was way to easy, I beat it in a week and I am not even a huge gamer."
4,"Great customer service, inaccurate product description","This review is for the seller's customer service.I ordered this model specifically because of its ""Black, thick, inner cooking pan and heating system provide even heating"" as listed in the description, despite the fact that it's made in China (I preferred ""Made in Japan"" because of my belief that Japan has better quality control). After emailing seller, it was confirmed that the pan is actually the standard (thinner) pan. I received my refund immediately after requesting to cancel. For this service response, they've earned my loyalty and once I select a different model, I will target this seller. I hope the seller would get the description updated so that other potential buyers would not be misled as I did."
3,10 cup zojirushi rice cooker- used one sent!!,"I ordered this new from Amazon, but was sent an obviously ""used"" and repackaged one... This is disappointing. I hope it isnt a defective product!!!"
2,The Most on a Jacket,"Mostly drunk twenty-something from Australia and the US hang around jungles of Papua-New Guinea and neighbouring Irian Jaya of Indonesia, known historically a Scull Hunter Land, with predictable results.Two moments are the most to conclude: no way to be smart in the wilderness if even so nice as screened, and bit for in independence of this province from Jakarta is a laughing stock.In comparison with ""The Blair Witch Project"" this mocumentary is lacking intrigue while quite boring ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is even more dynamic."
2,Oh My Gosh!,I was totaly upset with this game... i think TFOTR for GBA was better! I turned in my game used cause on PS2 it stunk... Buy TFOTR and TTT both on GBA!
1,Bad,This Game is one of the wearst games that I have ever played. I never want to play this again. The graphics are very bad. game play is not good.
3,Wasn't what I thought it would be,When I played it for the first time I thought I was going to lose my mind!!!I didn't know you had to be Frodo of all people.I was expecting more action not all the running I had to do to get out of the Shire.And Frodo is pretty weak in the first few levels. It got better once I got to Aragorn and Gandalf. My stepson beat it and we were stunned that it was over so quick. The ending was a letdown. It was fun once you get past Frodo but if I had it to do over I would not by it.
2,ok....too short,i really liked how they did it based on the book and the movie it was fun to see the shire and the local pub.i thought the graphics could be alot better. rivendale was a rippoff because the water didnt move 3 demensionalthey threw in random levels and charcters which i didnt like. i hated the fact their voices were not the actors in the movies. spoiled it. but it came very fast nd well packaged!! i would highly recommend this seller. just not the game. (oh nd there were glitches at the end)
2,WAY TOO SHORT!!!!!,THIS GAME IS SHORT!!! I cannot believe how easy this game was to beat. I beat it in 2 days!! there is not much of a variety of enemies either. Only about 5 not counting the bosses.I would most definetly rent this game and not pay the 40 or 50 for it. This was the first game i got for PS2 and was disappointed. The only good thing about it is its graphics. They arent that bad. And there really are not many glitches in the game.
4,Really Boring!!!,I hate this game. The only reason i got it is because it was free when i bought spyro for my sister. I nevr play it because it is impossible to beat. Even if you like Lord of the rings dont buy this game. It stinks.
3,Too Short,"I was playing it, and then i beat it and i was like ""what? is my ps2 busted?"", no it's not, it's just that the game is that short, i beat it in three hours, it doesn't have much replayability, but if you're an avid Tolkien then it's a game you gotta play. It's true to the book and while it's short, it is very gorgeous, surreal makes really nice landscapes, if you want to play a better game then get Drakan: The Ancient's Gates, it's a much longer game and it's basically the same style except you get a really cool dragon.Read ""The Simillarions"" by JRR Tolkien, it's really good!"
4,Very good reading,"Do you know basic/intermediate Russian, but are you tired of reading traditional textbooks or boring grammars? Do you read Russian literature but find it slow and difficult? If the answer to both these questions is yes, then ""Using Russian, a guide to contemporary usage"" is a book for you; it reads like a novel, but is not a boring grammar. And it should help you advance to a more advanced level."
2,Another arcade translation,"I've always been a big fan of board games on video consoles. Monopoly Party was next on the list, and while it was fun the first few times playing it, it does get old fairly quick. The NPCs if you choose to play with them are very predictable and annoying at times. I also found myself getting bored and clicking buttons to quicken the pace at times, primarily because the animations can take a while.Some members of my household enjoy competing with each other for high scores, but the computer goes no higher than $99,999. Heck, I can get that in well under an hour of playing, and by that time I am too bored to care. I'll probably throw this game on once in a blue moon to kill some time, but that'll be about it for me."
5,An Unkown Rare collection,"This collection of the short lasting , British , not to mention Brilliant, mid 60's garage group,""The Creation"", are by far one of the great unknown legends of rock n roll. With over 20 tracks of melodic ,acidic, arangements with eye brow raising lyrics, ""Our Music is Red with Purple Flashes"" is by far my favorite album at the moment. The Creation could of easily been taken into high acclaim in the mid to late 60's ,alike The Who The Yardbirds,The Pink Floyd(with Syd Barret not the overated Dave) and The Animals, they were unknown and brilliant which is why buying this album is a really great idea, if your into the eary 60's garage sound, and the sort of ""pyscadellic"" phase, buy this!!!!! My favorite tracks include, ""Making Time"" (currently famous from the soundtrack of Wes Anderson's Rushmore)""life is just begining"" , ""painter man"" (later coverd by The Television personalties, along with making time) ""The girls are naked and they dance"""
5,Another Great Anime,"From one point of view, looking at the cover of this game, you may think its for 5 year olds, but believe me, you must be older than 5 to understand it. There are many missions and such to do. If you've seen the show it is also for any age range, and take a look at the price cheaper than most games this is aw deal if I ever saw one. Pic this game up, youll love it. Its probably the last game for Game Boy Color coming out."
3,4 Movie Marathon:L Classic Western Collection(Albuquerque/Whispering...,Don't think I'll be re-watching these. War Arrow wasn't so bad. Have not watched Whispering Smith yet. The fact that it was full screen made me happy.
5,excellent,Part of this set and some of Vol. 2 of the collection stay in the player nearly all the time. You buy this and you have found musicians that are true masters.
2,"Highly ""O.K""","This book has a lot of information and is valuable for research. It, however, is hard to read straight through and is too wordy at times. Therefore, i think it is highly O.K."
1,UNBELIEVABLY BORING,I have never heard of this show before but decided to take a chance and buy it. That was my big mistake. Lots of brief scenes involving too many people to enable you to be able to keep up with them. The very short second episode did not make things any more enjoyable. A complete lack of anything resembling a decent script made this a very tedious affair. Performances were okay most of the time. An over- the -top soap opera is the ony way I can describe the 2 episodes. I won't be watching any further episodes.
4,Really fun game!,"I just bought this used for my GBA, and I love it. It's much more fun than I expected. I recommend it to any hockey fan or anyone just looking for an exciting game."
5,the way it should of been,as a long time fan of both anime and manga and also growing up watching GI JOE in the 1980s this was the answer me and my fiancee wanted a more mature story!i do hope theres more to come.
2,THis is a misleading title,"THis text is the annotated instructors edition, which is great. (Unless of course you are trying to learn)I am glad it was half of the price."
1,-5,"I'll have to agree. This text is the definition of vague. The examples given just don't explain anything in great detail, or even in detail at all. Just awful."
2,.....,THis is one of the werst games i've ever played. the game play is horable. o man...(sry to the fans of this game this is just wat i think) i would not sug jest you buy this game it is a waist of money.Thats all for me.
4,Spidey Mayhem !,"Great Voice ! Spidey is back ! with Mr.Buble bubblin up the charts ! not a bad CD ! i think it will come up the charts....Well as they say ""Let the Mayhem Begin with this Song"""
3,Perpetual dieter writes...,"Although the concept of the book, which is to eat no more than twenty grams of fat a day, makes sense; it neglects to tell the reader up-front that it is a vegetarian diet. Only after reading through the recommended daily diets does one realize that there isn't any meat included! If one eats mostly fruits and vegetables, and some grains, meat can be included while still remaining under twenty grams; but I wouldn't imagine that kind of diet is safely recommended. The plastic attachment that helps to keep track of the fat grams consumed throughout the day is very handy though. If the reader is willing to forego meat, then I would recommend the book, but otherwise, it's a little discouraging."
4,Simple to use,"I like this reference because I can just flip to the subject and find the fat grams of any food. It is so simple, small and portable. Sandy Beeler Knoxville, Tn"
5,The real deal,"As a serious home chef, I do a lot of Moroccan cooking with recipes that call for harissa. This is a perfect, slightly smoky blend of spices that really enhance my tagines."
2,Too cutesy to be clever,"I have read many Lizzie books and this one is among the worst. Mr. Masterson is sarcastic and obnoxious in much of the book. He mentions how he will prove to us forensically that Lizze didn't do it but there are no forensics there. There is nothing but wild supposition and lots of made up facts.The truth is that no one really knows who killed the Bordens. It really is that simple, no matter how muddy Mr. Masterson makes the waters."
2,"okay, but could do better","a well made glove, but the catching-webbing is not big enough for a softball. I think this glove is mis-marketed; it would do much better service as a baseball glove. As a baseball glove, I give it an A+; as a softball glove, a C minus."
1,Evolving in the wrong direction...,"I LOVED Brand New after hearing their single from Deja Entendu. They're a great band and I absolutely adore Jesse Lacey but what happened? Yes I understand artists have to evolve but I think this album really deviates from what they were doing before. I fell in love with the punk/pop tunes, not some strange ambiance music they probably use as background music on movies.I don't agree with any of the reviews, particuarly the ones who say the instrumentals were the best songs. They're boring to say the least. The song I enjoyed off this album was Millstone, but that didn't have a lot of playback value.If you want to get into Brand New, BUY DEJA ENTENDU! That is by far their best album. I just hope that Jesse, who I must say is incredibly talented, will not follow in Thrice's footsteps, who also made the mistake of ""evolving"" and creating a ""mature album"" of absolute [...]..Bring back the punk sound! I'm looking forward to your next album!"
2,Definitely a Drop,"This album is trying to be too artsy and too ""experimental"" even though a lot of it really isn't. Some of the songs are okay but a lot of them lack any real energy.Best songs: Jesus Christ, Sowing Season.Recommended: Download it."
3,Great Game but some annoyances do exist,"The game is a lot of fun but, there's parts where you might get a bit annoyed.Good parts:x Story is 3 stars - a bit childishx Animation is 5 starsx Cut scenes are boring - 2 starsx Game play is 5 starsx weapons are 5 starsBad partsx cut scenes are boring and don't add to the game - 3 starsx some of the story is a bit childish - 2 starsx the timer is a bit annoying - 2 starsx the camera stinks - 2 starsOverall - the game is fun - and long enough to get your moneys worth. I would buy it again but, maybe wait for a sale."
2,Sad and Disappointed,"I have all 18 of the Disney Treasure DVD's. Until this year, they have been of excellent quality. However, this year, with Disney Rarities and the Chronilogical Donald, Vol 2, I was very disappointed.The selection of material, in both the new additions, is exemplary, as usual. The quality of that material, however, is what leads to this poor review. Most of the material looks like it was untouched, and certainly not remastered as the packaging would suggest, before being transferred to DVD. Given the unforgiving nature of the medium, the material really looks poor. So poor that it takes away from any value this set might have had to a collector, and poor enough that even a casual viewer is going to be left unsatisfied."
2,Bought this one because we liked The Runaway Rice Cake,"We loved The Runaway Rice Cake but my duaghters and I were disappointed with The Story of Chopsticks. Even though we celebrated Chinese New Year with an orgy of Chinese fairy tales and assorted other books and DVD's appropriate for the holiday, the girls, 4 & 6, did not want to reread this book."
1,I do not enjoy overhearing this one,"This is typical children's fare. The cover art is low quality and unattractive. The characters are stereotyped. The action is loud, fast and frenetic. The boy is obnoxious and sarcastic. The characters have disrespectful interactions I would not like for my children to learn or repeat. The classical music in this CD is the only good thing. I'd rather just give my children the music."
5,Extraordinarily Great,"1st, 5 stars out of 5 stars isn't an adequate rating for this dvd release. This dvd set deserves at least 7 out of 5 stars for a rating.This dvd set continues where Season 1 of Gargoyles left off and expands the universe even further.It has commentary on all 4 parts of City of Stone, which vastly explain the backstory to Macbeth and Demona as well Demona a very sympathetic character.This release carries the 1st episodes of the World Tour which vastly expanded the Gargoyles universe very richly.Buy this set if you want to see the rest of the Gargoyles episodes released on dvds."
3,Feng Shui Your Workspace,This is a light and fun read. Many of the Feng Shui principles are practical. Many of them agree with common sense. You just need to be more open minded to absorb more on the subject. It is also about understanding the eastern culture.The book focuses more to an office environment. It tells you how to create a more favorable workspace cubicle or room.It just got a little repetitious at the end.
5,The Best Toy Eever!!!!!!!,If your getting a birthday presant for someone get this.The only problem is that you have to wait one day fore the water purifyer to kick in. P.S raed instructions carefully because you can find out really cool stuff like how to bring them back to life when they die.So I hope you leared alot from this note....... ...bye
2,This isn't as good as her other books.,"Out of everything i've read by her, this was the most dull. she went into such monotinous detail about EVERYthing. it got a little old. in the end, she was so unclear and poof! it was over before you could figure out what was going on. i found the ending unsatisfactory for more than just how unclear it is. but if i say more, it'll give the ending away."
4,Nice Book,"A very good read, this is one of the few quality authors on the fantasy shelves who as appeal for adult readers or more disciminating readers. Style reminds me of Patricia McPhillips."
1,Borring Sleeping Beauty Retelling,"I love retellings of fairy tales especially ones based on Sleeping Beauty, but this story was very borring. I once tried to read this book and I was barely able to make it to the ending and when I tried to read it for a second time I couldn't make it half way throgh the book. The characters are borring, especially Rosie the princess. She was portrayed as a tom boy who cuts off her hair and hates anything feminine, I like any princess as being portrayed as inependant, but I still think that it would good for them to still be feminine. The ending left me coufused. If you want to read a retelling of Sleeping Beauty I would suggest Briar Rose by Jane Yolen, it is different but it is also a very good book."
5,spindles end rocks!,"this was definately the best version of sleeping beauty I have ever read. Alternately told from the princess' young rescuer, reluctant fairy Katrina, and the princess herself, Rosie; this story is fascinating. It begins with the traditional story, the princess' birth, and the curse by the evil fairy now known as Pernicia. It continues over Rosie's first 21 years, covering important childhood events, and the all important revelation of her true identity as princess. McKinley introduces Peony, Rosie's best friend, who will have an important role in the princess' fate. The handsome, fairy tale prince enters the tale, this time as an apprentice to Narl, the village blacksmith whom Rosie is apprenticed to. The prince might not be the one to save the princess, though.......... As the good battles the evil, surprising twists come to the surface. Readers will be caught up in the mystery and magic of this book."
3,music of bernard herrman,I was thrilled to listen to the music by this composer this caused me to rent out some of the films for which he composed.
4,Pretty good info,"Its a good book to have for the person feeling creative and inclined to take the time and patience to do some of the things in the book. Its also a really good ref book for the person who's just curious in general about this subject. I haven't tried making anything from scratch, but I did enjoy learning about the different methods and uses written about in the book."
3,Overpriced and short,"Although this DVD on repeat (if your player has that option) would be a great backdrop for your holiday events, it only lasts 50 minutes. Also, it is (in my opinion) overpriced at 17.99 compared to some others that offer a similar showing in the $10 range. There is nothing spectatular about this that should have it priced so high."
5,Burke finally shared his collection!,"Andrew Vachss devotees know that Burke loves the way Judy Henske sings the blues.Unfortunately, until recently, none of her music was available in print, and was very hard to find even in out-of-print stores.I ordered two copies of the Safe House CD when I ordered the book, when it first came out in hardcover. (I knew that my brother, for whom I'd bought the book, would want a CD as well.) Having been a metalhead in the 80s and a lover of ""alternative"" music during the 90s, I bought the CD out of sheer curiosity about Judy and not because of any love of the Blues.This CD totally entranced me, from the first time I listened to it. When I had a soundcard on my computer at work, I would listen to the entire CD from beginning to end every day without getting tired of it. It's like nothing I had ever experienced."
5,"Exciting, never boring, fantastic rhythm",Ever since I discovered this artist I have been collecting his works. Each one is different with the magnetism of varying rhythms and themes. I am so lucky to have found this artist with his other music companions to add to my CD collections.
1,"low-end classical/folk guitar, not a true steel string acoustic","I bought this exact model based on the price and the picture, and want everyone to know the fraud going on. This guitar comes in many bright colors, in both the standard and cutaway shapes. This review would apply to all variation of this 'Crescent' brand guitar.This is NOT a true steel string acoustic guitar. This is a low-end classical/folk guitar made for nylon strings, but strung with steel strings instead. This guitar (as all classical guitars) lacks the metal truss rod in the neck and the internal bracing needed to withstand the tension of steel strings. The result is a neck that curves forward under the strain, resulting in unplayable string height, and TERRIBLE intonation (notes off key at different frets).It is not ethical to market this as a child's or a beginner's guitar just because of the smaller size and low cost. A beginner would go nowhere trying to learn on this. Do not buy."
3,The story line is a little too scary for smaller children.,"We love the cd's in this series. We listen to them on car drives and they have added so very much to our lives. Thanks to this series my 7 year old daughter can recognize the compositions of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Vivaldi while listening to the classical station on the radio. What a fun way for a family to become familiar with classical music.But the story line of this one is a bit too sad for small children. If the cd had a warning, something like "" best for children over 9 years old"", or something like that I would have appreciated it. My daughter became quite frightened listening to the story and so I put it away. Maybe in a few years....."
3,Very dry book..,This book is a very uninteresting resource for programming concepts and I didn't like the way it was organized. Besides that it was a good starter?
5,excellent,The product was delivered on time and was what I ordered. Would purchase again from this supplierJohn
4,Good but not excellent.,For some reason the pen blots for me on my writing pad. Maybe the ink is to be blamed.
3,"Stroke 9 carries on the music, but no the lyrics.....","The music sounds great, this CD has the great stroke 9 rifts that I have loved for so long, but the lyrics were dissapointing. After the great meaningful lyrics of their last CD, the lyrics of this album seemed a tad childish at many moments; not what you would expect from guys who are of their age. I still listen to this CD, but I skip over half the CD because it annoys me to hear such shallow lyrics."
2,A disappointment,"After listenting to Nasty Little Thoughts cd so much that I wore it out I was so excited to see Stroke 9 had a new album out. However, once I started listening to Rip it Off I was disappointed. It is, in general, an ok cd, but if you are looking for something similar to NLT this is not it. If I had heard any of these songs on the radio I would have not guessed that it was Stroke 9. The music on this album does not sound like them, rather a nameless alt rock band."
5,I swear - the BEST Astor ever.,"I believe, these are the most sensitive arrangements/performances of Piazzolla's works. There is only one more close to this: New Tango, Brazilian Touch, also available @ Amazon. Check it out!"
3,Not hot!,"Bought this for my mom & she likes the size & simplicity, but says the coffee it makes is not nearly hot enough (to the point that it has to be additionally heated in the microwave)."
3,A lot of old guys talkin'...,"I don't mind the interview segments but that is pretty much all there is here. Over 2 hours worth. When i titled this 'old guys talkin' I am not being critical of the fact that the guys are older, but that there was little attention paid to recapturing who they were in their prime via photos or performance video. I feel this dvd was a little on the low budget side."
2,"great content, horrible formatting","I really enjoyed the sample version of this text, but upon purchasing the Kindle edition, I received a mangled version that is fairly distracting to read - broken lines everywhere."
4,Sweet Pad,I have owned this product for about 2 years now and its just as nice as when I bought it. I have use several different mice on it since I have purchased it and have come to the conclusion that this is one of the best pads for your money. I curently use a razer copperhead on it and it floats like ice on glass. I did have the problem with it staying on when I shut off my computer but I changed it to a pci usb card insted of a motherboard usb and it stoped. fyi the usb is just to light the pads outer rim upTHIS PAD'S SURFACE IS PERFECT FOR LASER/INFRARED MICE.
5,A Comprehensive Collection of Charles Addams,"I'm a big lover of the Addams Family... Still I'm not sure if Addams did any books just focused on the beloved, creepy family, or if all his books are a hodge-podge. I'm collecting a few of them here and there, giving my reviews when possible. I've also been back and forth to the library... I would have to say this book might be the one which offers the most comprehensive collection on Addams' work, including Addams Family. It's a big, fat book!And this is just a fun book to own, especially if you like to laugh or are an artist. You will get countless hours of entertainment in the cartoons here, which are really quite simple depictions of the macabre. Somehow, I imagine this book as being the one I'd take to the hospital for an overnight stay. (You could appreciate it even more on an IV drip...)"
4,average,"best tracks 2,3,4,6,10,11,12,and 16 shouts on 16 they shout out layzie 2 times krayzie shout outs all of bone and then soulja boy says ""ah dont forget the number 1 assassin"" stupid"
4,Hot... Irv you did it again!,"This is a very hot cd, or ep, or cd single, or watever you wish to call it. Features exclusive mixes of this realy hot song! It proves why Ja Rule is the best rapper, and Murder INC. is the best label!!!! ITS MURDAH!!!"
3,Black Swarm,This movie was a little scary but ignorant. I could not believe that these wasps could do what they did.
1,cd-Breathe,"Never received it... got all the other items I ordered except this one... So , how is it?"
2,or 1.5 hitlady was best but missing...,"..the famous hallway college gymnast out the window scene-crazy, funny and bathroom complete flood drown scene but not hear-i emailed many to the production co. on the box-but of course no responsiblity at all for this ripoff. the orig. aired of this in apx mid 70's showed on tv, the above 2 clips clipped bad here."
3,Too much repetition,"I agree with the reviewer from MN. I too was disappointed. This novel won an award, so I expected much more.The writing is so bogged down with constant repetition, words such as 'verily' and people's names, that it's distracting. Where was her editor? You don't need to say Tom, Tommy, Tom, Tom; Anne, Anna on and on, dialog after dialog, when only two people are talking.Tom's trip to Italy is dragged out to the extreme (the interlude with the two women) for no apparent reason.This story would have been wonderful if the editors had paid attention to these details."
2,Attention: English Majors,"It seemed like such a good idea--telling the story of Anne Boleynthrough the eyes of her sometime-lover Thomas Wyatt. But the result was disappointing. So much extravagant emotion is bettershown than told, especially when the telling is so high-pitched andoverwrought. Granted that the author has some minimal skill incharacterization, much more could have been done with the depic-tions of George Boleyn and his wife Jane. The little we know ofboth, historically speaking, is so provocative--but here George isjust an echo of Thomas, and Jane but a cipher!And where, pray tell, are our editors when an author can get awaywith such obvious errors in grammar and syntax? Ms. Dunn does noteven understand the distinction between ""lie"" and ""lay"" and continually employs ""you and I"" after prepositions when ""you andme is clearly indicated.For God's sake, let's send the lady back to grammar school beforeshe inflicts any more novels on us!"
3,I didn't think it was possible...,"...to enjoy a book but dislike the main character as much as I did. The concept of this book is a very good one, but many elements were either overlooked or relied upon too heavily. While it's possible that Wyatt was a very passionate man, as his poems suggest, the frequent references to his childhood and relationship with his cousin Anne Boleyn was syrupy and overly obsessive. There were, as another reviewer stated, long stretches of the novel (his trips to Italy) that were unnecessary to the plot. And at times parts used to thicken the plot left me unconvinced and indifferent.As I stated above, the concept is indeed a good one and oddly, I enjoyed certain elements of the book. But were I to pass the book on my shelf, I would not be tempted to reread it."
1,Wiring for Pros?,"This guy is seriously overstating the simplicity of the book.Its supposed to be for amateurs not pros and while their is afair amount of information ,it really comes up short with install tips.Would not recommend"
5,great resource,"I agree with most peoples assesmant that this is not for those without any prior knowledge of home wiring but it does go great with black and decker's book""Complete guide to home wiring""It does a great job of walking you through the do's and don'ts of electrical work as well as pointing out common pitfalls. It is a must have for anyone who does alot of electrical work and needs a reference for code compliance concerns."
5,Nice reference,"Plenty of tips and hints, plus the basics on all the wiring project I'll attempt. It's come in handy for changing some lights and outlets, swaping out the transformer on my doorbell, plus I'm getting ready to run some new branch circuits for a bathroom remodel. Based on what I read in other reviews, I paired it with ""Wiring Simplified"" for more specifics on the 2005 NEC. So far, those two have been all that I've needed."
1,"Makes ""Cats"" sound like Stravinsky","Music for idiots who find Muzak challenging. Lyrics for those who think Mother Goose is as witty as Noel Coward. Self-important meandering drivel, typifying America's love of the mediocre. In a city where ""Jekyll and Hyde"" and ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" pass as music and theatre, there's no reason why this dreck couldn't as well."
1,Very dated,"I studied for the GRE for 6 solid months and have used every book available on the topic. This book was the only one whose verbal section was entirely outdated. For example, there was a practice test that had reading comprehension questions dealing with material that was taken out of the test years ago (such as terms relating to analysis). Also, I had problems with the analogy questions. On the real GRE, the parts of speech are ALWAYS congruent to the stem word. This was not the case in this book!I immediately stopped using it as I didn't want to waste my time and felt that it was a complete waste of money."
2,"Poor book, software,","Neither the book nor the software is worth the time and money for this combination.The book includes the long pencil and paper examples one expects for the old pencil and paper test. There are a few updates for the new computer based test; mostly just mentioning what to expect. The entire section on the essay portion of the GRE is four pages followed by thirty pages of general grammer review. The mathematics review is more solid, but there are some mistakes in the text. It is a book that is not updated often.The same staleness extends to the software. It works, outside of the occasional fatal exception error, but provides little help above the minimum. There are only three practice tests; reviewing your mistakes is torturous; and the practice essays are not timed the same way as the real exam. There is no help in guessing your score on the essay portions.Overall, the combination of obsolete material and errors reduces the value to less than nothing."
1,REA GRE review book,"Simply put, this book was the worst preparation I can think of for taking the GRE. The verbal sections were terrible. The relations they defined between words were often tenuous at best in the analogies; their antonyms sometimes involved nouns (e.g., the antonym of ""mistral"" which is a strong wind... it's pretty tough to say that a weak wind is the OPPOSITE of a strong wind, simply a varying degree); and their reading comprehension section was the worst, and even included a typo in one of the readings. Their explanations on the verbal were also deplorable; seriously, I actually think doing their verbal sections may have hurt my score on the verbal section.The math sections were alright, but I didn't miss many questions so I can't comment on how helpful many of those explanations were.Seriously, in general, this was a joke of a review book, and you would absolutely be throwing your money away to purchase it. I really regret this purchase."
3,Verbal section worth the money,"I used mainly the verbal section, particularly the ""Explanations of Answers"" segment to boost my testing-taking skills. Unfortunately, both the ""Anaylitical Writing"" and ""Reading Comprehension"" segments are below average and much easier than the actual test, thus one must seek other resources in order to perform well, which I did, in the overall GRE verbal test."
1,Very poor book,"I have used books by both Kaplan and Princeton Review. I have taken Kaplan and Princeton Review tests on-line. Both companies make this book and the practice test look shoddy and amateurish. I am much stronger in verbal than in Math but when I took their computer test I got a 672 in Math and a 600 on the Verbal. It is a waste of money. Buy Kaplan or Princeton review. If you want good quality computerized practice tests, you need to pay for them. I thought 6 tests for $40 was too good to be true and I was right."
5,"Hard to find item, even now with Amazon","These are wonderful chips with a distinctive texture and crunch. The cheddar and bacon flavor fills every bite, and that flavor combination itself is difficult to come by. An excellent snack, meal addendum, or appetizer, Tato Skins in the Cheddar and Bacon variety wins all."
4,Wall Street revealed,"Wayne of Rebeccasreads recommends WHAT GOES UP as a gossipy history told in interviews with the movers & shakers of the fabled place we call Wall Street.Little in this world affects Americans as strongly as the inner workings of the financiers who make the decisions that impact our jobs, our retirements & our government policy. Yet most of us know very little about it. WHAT GOES UP aims to help us make sense of what's going on by telling us how we got here from the Great Depression to the Silicon Valley Tech melt-down.Eric Weiner is a respected, knowledgeable & (a bit too) sympathetic a journalist who has broken his interviews down into digestible chunks, as the financiers tell their stories in their own words, & interspersing them with the history of how big banks & investment houses were forced to part ways after the Great Depression, how the financial world was broken up & the rise of the players who have become today's household names."
4,A decent product,"Works pretty much 100%. A few quirks here and there that I had to google and figure out why X wasn't working or why Y was malfunctioning, but it's a decent product. Buy this if you're tired of using a different controller than what was originally intended for the game you're playing/emulating. You get your money's worth."
4,It works.....depending on what you use it for,"Bought this hoping I could use my GameCube controller with Need for Speed World, but it doesn't work with World. However, I tried it with NFS Hot Pursuit(2010 edition) and only had to assign buttons to the functions I wanted to use them for. Turns out it works pretty well, just not with everything."
2,Works great until you try to use it,Had to find the driver after an exhaustive search found it and it worked well until i tried to use it to game it makes NHL 08 go crazy if its even plugged in in other words its junk
5,XBOX doesn not work in W7 64,"xbox controllers ONLY do NOT work in windows 7 64but who cares, xbox 360 stuff is a superior replacementand the other 2 work great.packing was A+shipping came 2 DAYS EARLY! A++overall 5 stars in spite of the xbox w764 issue and have already purchased again."
2,Works But Not That Good On PS3,"When This Arrived I Was Hoping It Would Be The Ultimate Controller Cause I Love The Gamecube Remote So Much Its Better Than The Classic Wii Remote Almost As Good As The Playstation Controlers Its Good For Playing Platform,Racing and Other Genre But Not So Good On Fighting Games Thats One Of The Reason I Bought This Thing Cause I Played Capcom VS SNK 2 For About 2 Years And The Gamecube Controller Was The Best I Also Played With The Guilty Gear XX Accent Core For The Wii And Nothing Beats The Gamecube Remote. Now As For This Thing The Gamecube, Xbox,and PS2 Adapter It Works Good On PC Mine Was Running On Windows 7 installed Quick. Playing Roms is Great Better Than An Xbox 360 Controller The Driver Disk That Came With It Is Useless Playing It On The PS3 Is Good For Some Games When Playing Fighting Games On This It Doesnt Configure Right Also The Respond Time On It Is Slow Lost Alot On Street Fighter third Strike Online Its Good For Any Other Genre Eccept Fighting"
4,Good insight into the future of oil.,"I have started to read this book, and it is interesting and informative, about the production and use of oil, and I shall enjoy reading my way through the book."
1,A great book for geologists ...,"If you're not a geologist, forget it, this book is not for you. Apart from some trivia things, like the origin of the word ""Dollar"", the author goes on and on about aspects on oil that do not necessarily interest non-geologists like me. I was expecting more on the economics and politics behind the oil industry."
5,HAI !!!,"DJ Honda blesses this album with intense beats. Also, I was not dissapointed with any of the guest appearances. It was a good line up: especially with artists like The Beatnuts (Who the Trifest?) or De La Soul (Trouble In The Water) the albums gonna be good. Well worth checking out."
2,"This followup by DJ HONDA was good, but it could be better","While listening to this album, I had some doubts as to whether I got my money's worth or not. Depending upon your musical taste, you will find some good beats on practically every track but you may feel like you expected more. In my opinion, this is one of those albums that you have to try for yourself."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I have owned this unit for several months and although it looks beautiful, the base unit seems very cheaply made. My unit stopped working and will not even turn on. I think the baskets are a nice idea but as a previous reviewer stated, steaming does seem to take longer.I don't think these are well made and will probably fail long before they ever should. Look at a different steamer!"
5,A Glimpse of Another Time,"New England is fancinating and full of stories and legends. This book takes you to that time. The author shares his time consuming research to provide us a glimse of yesterday. Living in New Hampshire myself, I have been to America's Stonehenge. I have seen Big Island Pond and stepped on Escumbuit Island. The author who I have met, is a wonderful individual who cares about detail. If you like legends, if you like history, if you like descriptions of what people did in those times, then I strongly recommend this book."
4,"When it works, it's wonderful","We've owned several. Beautiful weight and functionality.However, the last one leaked uncontrollably from a manufacturing flaw. When I dissected the iron to discover why, I found the wire clamp on the red rubber hose to one of the steam/spray buttons had been put on in such a way that the red rubber had been torn apart during the manufacturing process. If Sunbeam fixes this, they'll have a winner. But there seems no easy way to get through to the company.I'm buying one more, hoping for solid manufacturing, because otherwise we love it."
4,"One of the many ""McEntire Must Haves""","In her first MCA release, Reba leaves behind the style she had on Mercury. A more modern sound is evident, especially on ""Poison Sugar"" and ""Every Second Someone Breaks a Heart."" The ballads that Reba is so famous for today began here. On ""He Broke Your Memory Last Nite"" and ""Tell Me What's So Good About Goodbye."" Her country roots run the deepest on ""Congratulations"" and ""Silve Eagle."" Just A Little Love is an album that every Reba fan should have."
1,The only mystery is why anyone would buy this book,"When you first start reading this book, you are immediately struck by the amateur dialogue and plodding narrative. There is an immediate impulse to check the front of the book because you think you've picked up one of those self-published or e-books by accidents -- you know the ones where authors pay to have their books publisheed?But not in this case. This book is stunningly poor, destined to fall off into obscurity fairly soon and to be remembered as the ""Ishtar"" of the publishing world."
1,Weak Tease,"I do not usually enjoy mystery novels, but I ""seemed"" to enjoy this one. It held my interest, but I felt it left many loose ends. The story gave many leads that went nowhere. The characters were not well developed and the ending was extremely weak. I thought it was a waste of my time because it had promise, but no direction."
1,Too Many Unnecessary Words!,"I love mystery and intrigue and I found some of both in this book, but I had to fight my way through too many bragging words about wealth and superior intelligence. Not what I want so much of in a mystery, or any fictional book. It's interesting and important to learn something about characters lives, but enough is enough. Even some incidental characters were given long, detailed, unneeded biographies. Should have been at least 300 fewer pages."
4,Not Your Everyday Mindless Read,"Usually my vacation reading require little thought as I use my books of the dog days of summer as pure entertainment. I am not suggesting that The Emperor of Ocean Park will enlighten the reader of the life of noted persons, or rewrite a historical moment, instead Mr. Carter speaks to you with vivid description and a respectful appreciation of one's ability to think along with the main character as he unravels the mysteries of his father's life and death.Often it is assumed that a black author writing about a black family makes it a black book. Not the case. Instead it is a suspensfull drama that any avid reader can relate to."
2,Verbose,This book needed serious editing especially the narrative. Carter did not get the hang of thriller writing. The plot was confusing. No character in the entire book was worth rooting for. I practically flipped through to the end as I had run out of patience to read.
2,Too much,"A different editor might have helped this work: I found too many characters, some too thinly drawn to be remembered when it counted, too many plot twists, too many cliff-hangings. I have enjoyed some of Carter's non-fiction, to which perhaps he should stick."
4,A First !!!!,"I loved this book. It was wonderful to read a mystery novel with a Black protagonist that wasn't a ex-con, cop, or a detective: but an intellectual and a legal scholar. I loved the pace, the interplay, and the intrigue on so many levels. The glimspe into the life of the Black upper-class is a welcome one.As someone who rented on the Vineyard, ""the way it was before"",and was not in Jack and Jill, it brought back memories of a different time.The only reason I did not give this book a five star rating is the editing. I agree with several others that some characters could have been merged or omitted and some of Garland's musings streamlined. I did find myself lost amongst the characters and having to look back to refresh my recollections, but that is the fault of the editors. I throughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to any one whose enjoys a good mystery. Write on Brother !!! I look forward to your next book !"
2,Let's get to the end.......please!!,"This book was highly anticipated and I'm glad I got it at the library because had I purchased it, I would have been disappointed. I really wanted to like it and I usually love a thick book but it was just too tedious and with all the characters I could not find one that I even remotely liked. Talcott was such a whiner and I didn't even care anymore if anyone ever found ""the arrangements"".As a black woman, may I say that this is a story about this one black family, the Garlands, so please don't think it's representative of middle-class or wealthly blacks as a whole.This could have been so much better. Maybe Mr. Carter's next book will be an improvement."
2,"Slow start, lost interest","I tried to wait a couple of years to let the hype about this novel die down before reading it, thinking that time would allow me to approach the novel without any bias from previous critiques. While I don't remember much about the reviews of ""The Emperor of Ocean Park"" when it was initially published, I do know that the story seems to lack the pace and suspense required for me to maintain any interest in it. The story centers on unraveling the circumstances surrounding the death of the patriarch of a prominent African American family. I was hoping that the concept along would keep me interested but the story moves too slowly. I'm not giving up on this one but I won't try it again for a few years."
4,No sex? No cursing?,"This book is a clean read. This distinguishes it from most of the novels published today. Was it too long? Yes. But, I cared about the african american professor dealing with his trials and tribulations. I read with interest to the end. I relished that faith was not ridiculed, but respected. If you are looking an edifying read, pick it up."
2,The most overwritten book I've seen in years,"This is a perfect example of today's extremely overwritten book. This book should have been half of its 580 page length. The overall story idea was good, but the execution -- the endless minutiae, the overkill on the themes of the upperclass black -- just turned into a complete mess. The hokey cliffhangers that formed the basis for ending almost every chapter were so amateurish and formulaic I was actually embarrassed for the author.What's become of today's editors? Why don't they edit (and cut) anymore? What's become of the single detail that commutes volumes about a situation, a character? This was an assault on my patience. I had to bail out after getting half-way through it. Guess I'll have to wait for the movie version to find out what happened."
1,wordy,the storyline could have been written in 300 pages instead of over 600 and I found it so hard to stay interested. I feel it wasa mistake to compare this book to John Grisham...
2,Too long to take you to a dull ending,I really struggled with this book. Even took it with me on a flight to China and back and could still not finish it with 12 hours on the plane ride both ways. Finally got it done last week and breathed a sigh of relief. I did it! I finished it! But why? Who knows? The book could have been done much better in about 200 less pages and more tension. I could see early on why Kimmer felt as she did. I did too. Avoid this one. There is too much more out there.
1,Over-Rated Racial Garbage,"Maybe I'm just a middle-class white girl from Un-diverse Central Wisconsin, but this book was way too racial for me. I don't understand how race can consume your entire life, your every thought, your every action. The author is WAY too hung up on who is of the paler nation and who is of the darker nation, etc. It really distracted me from the book and I had to put it down halfway through. I don't even CARE who killed the judge. I really don't. Seemed Mr. Carter wanted to make some type of social statement that I just don't relate to."
1,insomniacs delight,"What a lot of long-winded, stream-of-consciousness, plot- destroying, self-indulgent drivel. Other reviewers have suggested that the Editor is to blame - but I cannot even imagine an editor who would have agreed to edit this book. Edit it properly and it becomes a pamphlet. Buy at your peril - unless you are a chronic insomniac."
3,I wish I could be more excited about this book,"I ""read"" the book on CD, excited that it had 19 disks and hoping that it would be a story that would keep me involved during long road trips. Alas, while it is interesting, intelligently written and somewhat intriguing, I found myself indulging in mental eye-rolls and wishing that Talcott would ""just get on with it!"" I was put off by Mr. Carter's constant reference to the two prominent races as ""the darker nation"" and ""the lighter nation."" Sometimes, it made no difference who the reference was about.The mystery could have held itself together better without Talcott's (Misha's) marital issues, and his constant references to his childhood, his parents, and his siblings.Cut by about 300 pages, this would be a terrific book!"
2,"Run-on Sentences w/ too many commas, obnoxious names, Needs editing!","The author writes in a way that is like swimming through thick seaweed. The sentences are run-on, too long, too many commas. The tense changes and it is annoying to read the ""I walk down the hallway and I . . . then I pick up the phone . . . and I look around and I . . . . type of writing. Was the book edited? If so, the editor should be fired. I couldn't finish it or get half way though. And the names of the characters are annoying: Kimmer, Mischa, Maria, Bentley, Addison, etc. Gag!!! It is an exhausing style to read. Will sell on Ebay or Amazon and won't be reading his books again. I prefer Grisham's style. Crisp, short interesting sentences."
5,Excellent Voice,I like this book. Even though the wimpy man was very annoying. and the storyline needed tighten up here and there. It was excellent read.
3,Ponderous,"Ponderous,a good story that would have been a lot better if Stephen L. Carter reduced the 657 pages to 400 (easy in this case). Carter goes out of his way to try to impress me with his vocabulary. Is the ""intellectual"" bigotry throughout the book espoused by fictional protagonist Tal Garland or really Stephen L. Carter????"
1,The Emperor of Ocean Park,"This is one of the most tedious books I have read in the last 10 years! With a BA in English, I was assigned some slow moving novels, but at least I HAD to read those. Do yourself a favor & pass on this one. No one has this much extra time on his hands to make this a worth while read. The characters are so self-absorbed & unsympathetic that I just couldn't wait for the whole ordeal to end."
1,Angst Ridden,"I was surprised by this book's similarity to those of similar angst ridden novels by Jewish writers such as Philip Roth. Although the central figure had not been emasculated by his mother he still seemed to have been. He is weak, self-centered and as decidedly unattractive as a man as Portnoy. He is just like Woody Allen wringing his hands and talking, talking, talking. I kept at it because I thought it had to get better. It didn't."
3,Carter needs a better editor,"This too-long book kept me reading, but I was brought up short several times, wondering how a brillitant legal scholar could describe the PUPILS of someone's eyes as being colored; how his hero could dig through ""sodden"" soil to the ICE BENEATH; and his uncertainty about why the attic of a house is HOTTER than the first floor.But the ferocious WHITE RAT in the cemetery made me laugh out loud! Before Carter publishes another book, his editor should give him an elementary science book, and a word limit."
3,Too drawn out,"I found the book very drawn out and repetitive. The author kept abandoning the plot line to discourse on the problems of the darker race, which left me confused at times. This was his first published novel, so I hope he learned to decide whether a book would be an entertaining read or a treatise on the woes of the world."
5,Well done!,"I'm not going to lie; itwas a chore to get through the first 100 pages - it was that slow of a start. It takes a little while for the book to pick up speed, but when it does, it's a great, page turning read! I highly recommend this book. And please don't give up in the beginning because the middle and ending makes it all worthwhile!"
1,Frequently corrupts files,"I saw reviews on Amazon and other sites about some users having difficulty with the PNY 8GB Flash Drive corrupting their files. That made me nervous, but I'm an optimist so I gave it a shot and ordered it.After it arrived, I tried it on my home computer which is Windows XP Pro. I copied a few fairly large .zip files and then without even removing the USB drive, I attempted to access them. 2/3 of them were corrupt and were not able to be read.I then brought the USB drive into work and used it on my Windows 2000 Pro Workstation. I had the same results, corrupting about 50% of the files copied to it. Large files seemed to be corrupted more often but even some small 28k files were unable to be read within Word or Excel.I just sent an email to request an RMA."
5,Awesome book - lots of insight and good advice,"Mary Sheedy writes in a friendly style and is always compassionate to the needs of kids and parents. I got a lot of great insights and my 3 year old daughter is sleeping better at night now. I do wish there was a chapter specifically addressing the needs of teens. Now I that I know the effects of sleep deprivation, and the importance of a schedule, our family is doing what we can and I definitely see an improvement."
2,Mostly A Vanity Project,"There are some good points and important insights in this book, but I can't recommend it. The author (who is bisexual, not Gay) has good intentions, but all too often, his ego and ghetto-fabulous lingo trip him up. For a guy who used to be a teacher, Mr. Setfrey's grammar leaves something to be desired. ""Ebonics"" or Black English doesn't have to sound ignorant! I didn't like his casual use of the word ""homo"", either. My biggest objection is to his comments about the Black women who have been attracted to him. Yes, those women were homophobic, but they didn't deserve to become the butt of crass jokes. Tearing other people down to build yourself up, that's not the answer."
1,Shopping for a nice CD? This one isnt' it.,"This CD contains objectionable language. His CD entitled Sin and Soul is much better, and his CD entitled Then and Now is also very good. You should avoid Movin' On if you object to vulgar language."
3,Watered down classic.,"I might have rated this CD higher if I hadn't heard Classical Kids ""Beethoven"" and ""Bach"" CDs first. This is, unfortunately, a watered down, ""Disneyised"" version of Mozart's opera. Neither faithfull to the story, or in my opinion to the music. Still better than most of the stuff tossed out for children, but only a small step above ""Hooked On Classics""."
5,Worth it!,"This thing is great. It fits over my kitchen sink drain perfectly, and doesn't let any food get down there when I'm washing dishes. Food doesn't get stuck in the holes either. And no rust, a few months later. Worth the few extra bucks."
5,A better strainer!,"The Endurance strainer is exactly what I wanted. Beats a pop-up sink strainer. They may seem pricey, but are easy to use and worth it. Delivery was faster than promised."
5,Strong & Easy to Clean Out,These are great strainers. I've purchased at least a half dozen already and recommended them to others. Heavy gauge metal that won't bend up the way screen ones do. Nice large size to fit over entire drain. Easy to clean by knocking against garbage can or swishing in wash water. Catches most food particles.
2,Lacks clear statement of dimensions,"I would have bought this... but could find no clear statement of its dimensions. Nothing indicates what is the size of the drain opening in which it is supposed to fit, or whether the description ""1x6x6"" means that the outer rim of the top flange is 6"" in diameter...or what. Inquiry to Amazon yields only the unhelpful statement ""we show the description provided by the manufacturer."""
1,"Not a very good ""What If""!","Of course, Jackson being at Gettysburgh is one of the biggest ""what ifs"" of all time. However, this author really doens't put much thought into the battle that could have happened. The battle that happens in this book is won by the South because they ""try harder"" for Jackson. If you want a what if book, read ""Gettysburgh"" by Newt Gingrich because this book stinks."
3,Just a bit of tape...,"The readings on this gauge have been at least believable; I don't have a calibrated comparison, but it seems to be pretty accurate overall. After several uses air started leaking from between the body and head of the gauge, but a bit of electrical tape had it back to good working order quite quickly. It is great for the price but is not a heavy-duty tool."
3,Watch out for that 5 iron,"I bought these clubs for my husband back in 2006. He does not golf that much, maybe 3 times a year at most. However, the very next year, 2007, he went golfing and called me from the golf course saying that the 5 iron broke at the grip during a swing and he cut his finger. I was so upset. I thought that I was getting a good set and this happens. I just hope the other irons are more durable. I called Adams Golf and they said that there is a 2 year warranty on the clubs. So I hope that their customer service and warranty are better than their clubs."
2,Too many words and confusing,"The book is so heavy on words that it is hard to follow. The author started with ER Diagrams (he made it very complicated when it is not that hard) and then jumped into SQL. Needs more SQL and less ER Diagrams. Then he went into Hard Drive and memory, which is not necessary. This books should be base on Databases and Java, therefore it is poor on this issue. I believe there is another book out there, which can be better."
2,Almost worthless as a textbook,"The book relies heavily on explaining concepts through the examples outlined. So heavily, in fact, that trying to understand a single concept is almost impossible without reading the book as a whole.To use it, you kind of have to read it cover to cover--novel style. This is rarely a useful way to approach technical learning, and other books do much better with alternate approaches."
3,Never used the book,"This book was purchased for a class, but the teacher never had us even turn to page 1. Therefore, I'm only giving it three stars because I honestly don't know if it's a good or bad book."
4,METAL,"This albume is increadabel, freaking brutal. The albume is hard, heavy, and fast and the production is clean, so you can actully hear what the music instead of so many death and black metal bands which is drowned in distoration. From the opening track when you here SLUT 666 screaming you'll know this albume is not for the weak at heart"
4,A date somewhat influenced by Coltrane,"Former Ray Charles saxophonist David ""Fathead"" Newman holds his own with this 1960 quartet for Atlantic made of Wynton Kelly (piano), Paul Chambers (bass) and Charlie Persip (drums). As with many albums by tenor saxophonists of this period, one can hear the all-pervading bebop influence of John Coltrane in this set. While not filled with the hard bop/soul jazz Newman would come to be known for, this is definitely an essential album for any fan."
2,Dissapointing debut from Outlawz member,"I was always looking in stores trying to get this one so when I saw that u could buy a used copy I litterally jumped on it...But when I put in the cdplayer I was very dissapointed , First of all on some songs it sounds like a 3-year old made the beats they sound really cheap.And on almost every track FATAL sounds uninspired...This was even more dissapointing than SNOOP DOGG's ""Da Game Is To Be Sold""...Of All Outlaw related albums I have heard this is the worst... Go take another listen at Tupac's albums instead of buying this, or perhaps buy OUTLAWZ - NOVAKANE instead"
4,soo good,"Definitely see this movie if you get a chance, Robin Tunney is very funny in it, it was very nicely put together, and Jason Priestley is awesome and looks great as well, the soundtrack to this movie is great, kinda made me laugh and go oh i remember that song. so good, see it."
1,too acedemic,"I was disappointed with this book because it is too acedemic. It covers a lot of theory but is not very practical with only a few diagrams. While a professional massage or physical therapist would enjoy reading it, a horse owner wanting easy to read instructions with diagrams, would be disappointed. I would borrow it from a library, but it is not worth buying."
1,Worthless,"Within 1 week of purchase, the timer broke and within 10 uses it will not even get to temperature -worthless unit."
4,Fun with Cooking,"I have used this three times now. The first time was a bust--I added the starter when the milk was hot and the yogurt didn't set. The second time was fine and the third was plus-minus. I used yogurt with live culture the third time, but obviously my technique needs improvement. Will ask a friend what she does. Someone else told me that she uses dry starter that comes in a box, and I may look into that.Yogurt is easy to make and I don't want to scare anyone off. Like anything else, you need to be familiar with the equipment. Guess I don't like cooking so much that I love to dabble around. This is a good unit and I'm told you can replace broken jars with baby food jars. One word of warning: the timer alarm will go off at the required time, but it's faint. I guess people complained about being jolted out of bed.Oh, another word of warning. You have to boil the milk and you need to watch it very carefully or you will have a big mess."
2,Thumbs down,I respect that this is a fairly old children's book - but it ultimately offers very little - both in the way of story and illustrations. Pass it by.
5,"Good everyday fountain pen, great value","Since the Phileas came out a number of years ago, I've had 4 of them (3 fountain and 1 roller ball). These fountain pens have never let me down and have always been sound in quality. The first was the original red and blue series, the others were later blue and green marble models. They look nice and write very well. Many fountain pen users regard the Phileas series as the best place to start with fountain pens, and I agree with that. They're easy to clean, easy to use, and mine have always been ready to write for me. I whole heartedly suggest this pen as a fine addition to any pen collection, as well as for a nice fountain pen to use on a daily basis."
4,umbrella adjustment,Umbrella works GREAT but when cranking it down it cranks so very(LOL) hard. Other than this I would say the material for the umbrella could stand to be a little heavier.Not bad for the price though.
3,The time in which story takes place confusing,"This is the first book I have read by this author. Maybe I should have started with a different book by this author. What I had the most trouble with is the timeline. The things that were going on in the early 70's in this book seemed more like present day. I mean rap music, A $175,000 sports car. Besides that the story seemed to drag on."
2,SUPERFICIAL TREATMENT OF A PROVOCATIVE TOPIC...,"This is a quick, easy read of a provocative and timely topic, considering that baby boomers are aging rapidly. It is unfortunate, however, that the reader does not get to know much about the author or her alleged psychic gift. This has the effect of creating somewhat of a credibility gap between the reader and the author, making what the author has to say not particularly believable. Perhaps, if the author had given more information about herself and her gift, the accounts that she gives would ring more true. This would have made the book more effective. As it stands, the book, although somewhat thought provoking at times, lacks depth, and fails to fully capture the reader."
3,Oh that Bram!,Some stories are better than others but must reading for classic horror fans. Can beat the Kindle price. Get it.
5,"Read it, and flipped back to the beginning","I adored this book. It's told in a way that gives you multiple perspective and, although a work of fiction, pulls you in to a world that seems real. I've recommended it to several friends, and will definitely read it again and again, just excellent historical fiction."
5,Classic Victorian Horror,"I enjoyed this book very much, being a great fan of the original Stoker Dracula story. I knew there were several short stories, however the Kindle edition had them separated like chapter titles, not separate books so it was not clear to me that the second story was not part of the first when I first started reading it. No problem, it soon became obvious. However, the first story, Dracula's Guest, is classic horror full of atmosphere, suspense, and terror. It is not written as journal excerpts like Dracula was, but in typical story form. The other stories were good too, some I liked better than others, but all good reads. Read the other reviewers, I side with those who gave it a 5-star rating. I have read Dracula three times, I'll probably re-read Dracula's Ghost a couple more times (on dark stormy nights!)."
4,The Replacement Chapter,"This ""short story"" was originally part of ""Dracula."" It was left out at the behest of the publisher and published after Stoker's death by his wife. I've read ""Dracula"" many times in my life, and enjoy ""Dracula's Guest"" as a ""lost chapter"". It is obvious where the account fits into the book because it builds up to the letter from D. to the innkeeper which *is* in the book.In defense of the original publisher's ax to the chapter, the story is much more rapid paced and has less of the ""haunting realness"" that rest of ""Dracula"" has - it is more in the pulp style of Stoker's ""Lair of the White Worm"".SPOILER >> It adds a little depth to Jonathan Harker's journey to the castle in the form of a foreshadowing encounter with another vampire. << SPOILER"
3,Package was dented,I received this item ver fast but when i received it the collectors tin was dented. Hope the dvds are not damaged.
2,So typical now - Fan Rip-Offs! Now Disney Too!,I was going to order until I read about how INcomplete this collection is! Although PRICED as a complete collection! JUST SAY NO to Ho$$ywood!
1,Nobody knows but maybe Disney does,"Dear Disney People,In homage to the theme song from the delightful SWAMP FOX series, I now sing to you ---Swamp Fox, Swamp FoxTail on his hatNobody knowsWhere the other five shows are atSwamp Fox, Swamp FoxDisney makes me blueAll I can say isDisney, what the heck is wrong with you?(Needless to say... to issue only three of the eight Swamp Fox shows is utterly pathetic. Shame on you, Disney.)Sincerely,t.g. randini"
3,You Tortured my Kids!,"Disney people, what were you thinking? Swamp Fox should have been released with all 8 episodes, no question. But if you are going to pick only 3 episodes, why end with the tragic death of a kid and preview future episodes of his revenge, BUT DON'T RELEASE THEM? MY KIDS WERE UPSET BIGTIME!They are big Disney fans but you really gave yourself a black eye with this one.Please, please, release ALL the Swamp Fox episodes!"
1,No excuses,"As the narrator says, ""take a break from reality"". The Swamp Fox is classic Disney revisionist history, but it's still plenty of fun, especially if you can remember the original broadcasts in black and white. BUT, as other reviewers have stressed, the disk contains only the first three of the eight episodes. Episode three even has the trailer for episode four, but that's where it stops. For as long as this set has been out, it's clear Disney has no intention of releasing the remaining episodes. I recommend not purchasing this incomplete issue."
2,"What's wrong with you, Disney?!!!",I enjoy watching the Swamp Fox and I liked the three episodes that I saw on this DVD. Why Disney did not include the other episodes after 3 is beyond me. They had plenty of room on the DVD for it. The end of episode 3 is a terrible place to end the collection. I wish I had paid more attention to the box/reviews before I bought this. I feel totally ripped off!
2,"Do the whole series, how tough can it be","Count me among those who would jump at the chance to buy the whole series if available but will not buy just part of the set. This was a tremendous piece of television and happily coincided with my history lessons about the American Revolution in grammar school. Why would they only release part of the series. Surely they have all the original tapes. Anyone who loved this series from their youth would want all 8 episdoes, not just a selected 3. Who's minding the store at Disney. They are missing the boat on this one."
3,Also disappointed,"But not with the Larken story line - It didn't bother me 35 years ago either. No, I felt that Burnett was too over the top as the queen, and Ullman wasn't over the top enough as Winifred. Also, I missed the part of the minstrel, which was totally cut out.Maybe it needs to be viewed as a live production, but I found this version flat. And I was really looking forward to it."
3,Just alright,This is an ok cd. I was expecting something better and thats really all I can say. I mean I do like a lot of the songs like 'shake me' and 'nobody's fool' but the finished product just didnt cut it for me. I'm fairly new to Cinderella and from what I heard of them I know their a good band just maybe they chose the songs that I like least from them. Maybe if I tried different albums instead.
3,Mixed Results,"The auathor of Get Hired Fast offers some good suggestions on the direct calling method. With several researching tools available today such as ReferenceUSA and LinkedIn, the direct contact method is indeed a possible resource.However. like many job searching methods its just another way and getting your reume in front of the hiring manager. The author clearly states that the odds are still slim even using this method. The book is a little outdated with new technology but still holds some merit with the strategies that is detailed.Overall the book is moderately helpful."
3,short?,"Is the pad supposed to be a little short in order for the corners of the fitted bottom sheet to fit? I don't know, but that would make sense.I don't have a super thick mattress to begin with on one of my beds and it seems all the new sheets I buy can accommodate really deep mattresses, so an accurate sized pad is what I need, not a shortened one. I guess if you had a thick mattress and your sheets just fit, this might work for you."
4,To hot to handle,"Shemar was excellent in this movie,he really showed the viewers that he's not just another pretty face. Although I wish that him and Nia long got more romantically involved in the film. (He also looked especially good when he got out of the shower). God bless America."
4,"I had my doubts, but I loved it!","Shemar Moore (of soap opera fame)played a believable victim, somebody you would like to help. The cast was well placed and deserves a big clap on the back for some great performances. In the beginning, it doesn't look like it's going to be that good... but it turns out to be an entertaining, and fun film. I really enjoyed it! I would recommend this movie for anybody who likes action!"
1,disappointing,"The actual product looks quite different from picture on website - looks cheap, no shine - I was very disappointed."
5,Muro 128 Ointment is a great product....,"It was much less expensive online than at the pharmacy. And it works great for my dyr eyes at nite. My eye doctor recommended this product. Been using it for years. Will buy always online from now on. Thanx, Judy"
1,Better when amazon kept the 2 pak in stock,"This was a good deal the first time I bought it from amazon. There was free supersaver shipping and I was able to get it at a good discount compared to my local drugstore. Now, with the shipping costs, it is virtually the same. What's up with the change, Amazon?"
1,Disappointing,"If you want to sit down and listen for 8 straight hours, then this is for you - if you want to listen to any of the 7 stories individually, then you'd be much better off buying the book and reading into your own recording machine. This tape series is very poorly done. 6 two-sided tapes are included in the package with absolutely no additional information. The first story does indeed start at the beginning of side #1, but after that, you're on your own; maybe it ends at the end of side #2 or maybe somewhere in the middle of side #7. Who knows. I've given up trying to cue up any of the other stories, as there's no way of knowing how long any of them or where any of them start or end.If, after reading this, you still want to buy it, email me and I'll put mine up for sale at Amazon. It's useless to me."
4,A video can't replace Tesla but...,"Tesla's life and history was greate and strange. Personally I felt that this video could be better. I don't understand Tesla native's lenguage and used english weren't very clear for a video intented for sale worldwide. Any way, every thing about Tesla is interesting."
2,torn togas,This was a very informative book. I have never been in the Greek system but my son is in his first year of college. I have a much better understanding about the reality of these social griups.
2,Be sure to read the fine print,"Make sure you read the fine print!This bracelet is silver TONED, not sterling silver. The embossing is also not the greatest - clear on the one side, but hard to see the letters on the other."
1,Wore 3 days and threw it away.,Actually I only wore it 2 days to work. I took it off at night and put it on in the mornings. On the 3rd day I noticed the silver peeling off. I tossed it. I know it was inexpensive but that was down right cheap. Never again!!!!!
2,Crappy,this product was pretty crappy...if you wear it once or twice it will be fine. but my mom wore it for a couple of weeks and the silver finish wore off to this weird rusty under. Not a very good product if you want it to last.
1,Trashy romance novel!,"I am a fan of the Ginkgo Tree. Mind you, the actual tree and not the book I am reviewing.I purchased this book in hopes it was a book or text about the trees. It was not. It was a romance novel.I do not know if Miss Burns ever had a loyal following, or if she was even a good author. What I do know if for other Ginkgo tree fans out there, beware of the title of this book.A cursory look over the book did not make it seem as if it were even a good romance novel."
4,Let's hear it for the boys!,Brilliant film documenting the life of these two gifted songwriters. A must see for any Disney fan. Get this movie!
4,Calphalon 7 Quarts Chef's Casserole,"I think this is a fine product. I was hoping it would be made heavier.I did read the instructions and recognize this is supposed to cook differentlythan other pans. I tried it a couple of times and it seems to match the expectations as provided in the instructions. Still, it would be nice if it were a heavier gauge metal."
4,Good functional pot,The pot overall is very good and functional and a real help around the kitchen. My only one knock is how thin the pot material is now.
2,Pam in va,"Pan is ok. I use fairly often for speghetti,stews or soups. Pan has turn white-ish inside where food cooks. I wonder if it is going to rust soon. I have had it for a year. I think pan is overpriced."
4,I think I like this book more than my son does right now.,"This is a wonderful book for any little train lover. However, the subtle correlations between the ""bedroom"" train and the ""country"" train are lost on my 3 year old right now. I love how Brown mirrors the toy train set-up in the household with the real train travelling through the countryside on the opposite page. The artwork is lovely, and the story is clear and simple. It's a nice, calming book, perfect for the end of the day."
3,A Review of Two Little Trains,"My children (boy and girl; 3 and 5) like the artwork in this book, and the cadence of the text -- which is good -- but it just hasn't become one of our favorites.Part of the problem, I think, is the actual word choice which is a little odd in places. For example, in describing the effects of weather, Wise says that the rain makes the trains darker, and the snow makes them furry. Sort of abstract for a 3 year old. Still this is a minor point when compared to the reference to a`black man singing in the West"" . Surely a reference to a variety of music that is beyond most young children's comprehension.""The moon shone down on a gleaming track,And the two little trains going West;And they hurried along and heard the songOf a black man singing in the West.""Three Stars. Very nice pictures. Good cadence without having good rhyme. The small problems I've noted will probably not keep train lovers from appreciating this book, but might keep it from becoming a favorite."
2,kids didn't enjoy the book,My 3 and 4 year olds just were not really interested in this book. Wish we'd just checked it out at the library instead.
2,3 out of 4 DOA,"Ordered four of these handsets... upon receipt, three are non-functioning in that the LCD display is degraded to the point of being unreadable. The fourth is marginally acceptable. Will be returning three units."
2,"Warren is a huge talent, but this is not my cup of tea","Warren Haynes shined in his 8 years in the Allman Brothers Band (particularly 1989-1994ish). He had a wonderful slide tone and a great voice that harmonized incredibly with Dickey Betts & Gregg Allman. He added incredible acoustic guitar at various times, as well as being another good songwriter for the band. His first solo album was also enjoyable (1993), if not great.This album, on the other hand just doesn't do it for me. It is entirely too dark and heavy & the songwriting isn't memorable. The vocals sound too angry for my taste and there are no harmony vocals on the record. I can see the attraction to the heavy/hard jams. I like jam bands, but I also like great melody & great songs. I feel that Warren is a natural talent who is made to play in more of an ensemble. He is also great in a country environment as can be heard on his recordings with David Allen Coe. I've been scratching my head about Gov't Mule since first hearing them in 1993."
5,Great Movie!!!!,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I am a huge movie buff so that is saying a lot. Great acting. Madeline Stowe and Aidan Quinn have great chemistry.
3,so as the saying goes,It thrilled. It chilled. It tapped the bill. Heavy hitter for a quiet sitter. Night time became horror time all over again. Don't blink.
3,"A Variety of Stories, A Good Read","I laughed so hard at the highschool reunion story. Loved the scene where the wife is sitting right there and a former classmate puts his foot in his mouth. The Handkerchief Mouse was fun and sad, too. A variety of stories, a nice read."
5,Unexpectedly compelling,"Even though the aspects of many of lives of the foster children in the author's care would be drama enough, Harrison provides a simplicity of prose that gives greater depth to the drama. That said, the emotional build-up ny the end of the book is amazing. Not a dry eye.I also liked how each member of the family is fully fleshed out. Her husband, the social services people, all deserve their own books for their selfless work as well!"
1,Contains explicit descriptions and instructions for oral sex,"This book shocked me when I found it on the shelf of our favorite local toy/book store. I was looking for a wholesome guide for my preadolescent daughter, and thumbed through this book, only find detailed instructions on how to perform oral sex! Shocked, I returned the book to the shelf and thought that perhaps I was just out of date. Now I am just outraged that the cover and blurb does not indicate the type of content. Parents could easily believe it is the kind of guide which honors a child's innocence, but it is not."
5,Thank goodness for this book!,"It's hard to be a woman, but this book makes it easier. This book is the only one I've found that sets up guidelines for learning to love your body--how to feel acceptance and peace. It's a radical notion (what would become of the diet/cosmetic/tanning/hair/orthodontic /fashion/cosmetic surgery industries if women decided they were beautiful in their own uniquenesses and they were just going to kick back and enjoy themselves?) This book sets out joyous and triumphant possibilities for the kind of lives we can choose to live."
4,classic hits,Looks good and got here in good time. Can't wait to watch all of it.Should be a good choice. Thanks!
1,Big Disappointment,I never thought I would be sorry after buying a BOOK from Amazon - the greatest disappointment! At least HALF OF IT is missing - sections 2 and 3. I have ordered 2 books on more or less the same subject- performance measurement- and both of them have the same FAULTS - missing pages! And I have paid a lot of shipping taxes from USA to Romania for WHAT?One thing is clear now for me: no more online shopping with Amazon!
4,i REALLY like it,i just got this today- and since i'm starting back into working out- i did just the first series Half moon series and the later matwork. i loved loved loved the half moon series- its like Ballet class all over again. very simple cardio based moves but i felt them as i was doing them. BUT for those of you who never did ballet dont worry Ellen explains and there are great camera angles showing you what to do and how to have your arms and legs etc. i have a feeling this will be on my weekly favorite list! it was very fun but just challenging enough plus enough encouragement to keep me from losing interest. its simple all you need is floor and its all you. i'm looking forward to some of Ellens other workouts too!.
3,"I know, I know","This book is considered by many to be a ""bible"" of survival books; I just didn't. There was a lot in there that didn't seem to apply to even my ""wildest dream"" scenarios, and too much stuff that I am almost certain that I would not do. (Yes, I have been in a couple of survival situations).Just don't make it your only survival book."
4,I'm all about this book:),"Interesting and totally useful in any part of the world. If you're interested in being prepared, this is a ""go to"" necessity. I keep it on my coffee table!"
2,SAS Survival Guide - SMALL pocket version,"Be Advised. IT IS A VERY SMALL BOOK and so is the print inside! Please Please Review the pictures before buying this version of this book.Although this small one may be easy to carry in a pocket or a pack during camping or Bug Out. For general everyday use and educational reading, the LARGER version of this book which AMAZON sells will be MUCH more enjoyable and useful. You'll be a lot happier!!!!I urge caution! Buy a magnifying glass along with this small book."
3,In need of an editor,"The content of this book gets five stars for being neatly organized and helpful, however this edition is in serious need of a revision.My first indicator was the introduction to the book. It mentions the Berlin Wall coming down in 1999. An oversight like this is inexcusable and sent up warning flags right away as to how many eyes had actually read the book from cover to cover (as I'm in the process of doing).The text is written in a British style (SAS, of course), which will take some getting used to for US readers but isn't a big deal. That said, I've still had to re-read several passages due to poorly assembled sentences which lack proper punctuation. Has this guy ever heard of a comma? They can be a lifesaver to a reader. Again, not to be a grammar snob, but if you want to use this as a quick reference in a time of need, the last thing you want to tackle is a confusing run-on sentence. Those are my major gripes."
5,Awesome,"The only question should be why would you not buy this book? Its the perfect size to fit in your backpack or BOB and costs only $8.Sure some will say ""well i already know most of that"". i guarantee someone in your party will not, or in a time of stress your mind will go blank and this book will remind you how to identify snakes and wild plants (with color pictures), multiple ways to start a fire, trap animals, find water...all in the size of a stack of index cards. If its too thick for you, the pages a glossy and sturdy enough to tear out what you feel is important and laminate them to make a small set of guide cards.This book has so much valuable info in such a small space I am going to buy one for every bag that goes with me when SHTF."
4,Valuable and extremely tiny,"Expressed in terms of days added to your life-span divided by packing volume, this may be the second most valuable object you can own in an outdoor survival situation. Unless, like Burgess Meredith in that old episode of the Twilight Zone, you can't read small print without your eyeglasses, in which case you will have just succumbed to a new wave of natural selection."
5,Outstanding wilderness survival guide,"I tend to be more of a prepper than a survivalist, but I did fit Wiseman's SAS Survival Handbook to contain some very useful information. If I ever find myself deep in the jungle with only some paracord and a knife, this is the book I would want in my back pocket. I read another book, 31 days to Survival by Creekmore, and I was shocked by how little information was in that survival book. The SAS guide has everything you could imagine, including foraging for food and water, getting rescued, building shelters, and more."
5,good read,"I bought this book mainly to work on honing some outdoor skills, especially identifying plants and acquiring water. I would recommend it for all."
5,Good survival book!,The bible of survival guides. Small enough to fit in a backpack and has a tonne of info in it! Great!
5,SAS Survival Handbook,"What can I say about this book that has not been said already? I love this book chock full of information critical to survival, and what could be better than getting the info from an actual expert. I practice in my backyard all the time with my kids, in fact I'm going to purchase a few more of these book and hand them out to my relatives. this book is a must for every person living on this planet."
3,"Good, but attempts to do too much","This book has some great chapters, but encompassing ""all survival techniques for all situations"" is just too ambitious and the book suffers in several chapters because of the scope that is being attempted.the chapters on trapping and snares, knots, and some others are perhaps sufficient. but the other chapters are just too vague to be of service. I would have preferred more detail in a narrower list of topics."
4,A little package with a lot of information!,"Nothing beats 'How to Stay Alive in the Woods' by Brad Angier, but this comes in as a close second. Easy to throw in a backpack, and chock full with a myriad of situations we hope to never get into. Well worth it!"
4,"Great book, very informative",Lots of useful tips on how to manage your way through the environment. I would recommend for any camper or hiker.
5,Review of SAS Survival Handbook.,"This is a great survival handbook. I've reviewed several similar handbooks before, but none of them compare to this survival handbook. It describes situations and survival techniques you can apply nearly anywhere. I especially liked the detailed instructions for starting a fire from ice. Check it out! A perfect manual to have in your 'emergency"" pack, and another in your car, ""just in case."""
1,A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"When I first found out about a book written by a SAS-specialist,Iwas thrilled;this must be the state-of-the-art,The legendary SAS!After reading the chapters of special interest-hunting,firelighting etc.,I came away baffled:for instance,the information on building archery equipment is not only incompetent but downright useless-the false generalisations and misconceptions are too numerous to mention here.The same applies to the text on firelighting- I wonder if the SAS-let alone you-could survive on this !The attempt to squeeze ""survival anywhere on the planet""into a single volume is in vain.I ur ge you NOT to depend on this book for survival-it might kill you.I really hoped I could have written a more positive review..."
4,great,"its very quiet. it doesnt lag, actualy the software even speeds up the mouse's movements. range is good. i could type this from my bed because it allows me to zoom in and it works 6 feet away. i tested it up to 30 feet away and it still worked. the presets are awesome except the ones that are set up for websites, dont work with google chrome. other than that my only grudge would b the small size of the top extra buttons. ive already typed 44002 characters and still counting. the alarm can be useful. i have very keen hearing and if its late and theres not a sound in the house i can actualy hear the mouse transmittin the signal. my last mouse it was only audioable if u put the mouse to your ear. also the mouse is tinier than my microsoft wireless explorer but i got used to this one. overall great"
2,Heads Up : Vista Users,"I would encourage anyone running Windows Vista to check the Logitech Support Forums or customer FAQ before purchasing. After purchasing this product and installing on a brand new Vista-ready PC I found that the Logitech software disabled system sound. Returning to Amazon, I found this issue documented by another Amazon reviewer. If I had noted this earlier I would have purchased something else or at least held off until this issue was resolved.I tried to resolve the issue with Logitech Customer Support for almost three weeks with no luck. The other reviewer (Scott Solanik) experienced the same result after working with them for over three weeks. I am assuming that a significant number of the favorable reviews here refer to Windows XP. - Although the keyboard and mouse are nice, I would encourage anyone using Vista to hold off on their purchase until they can confirm that Logitech has a solution for this known issue.In my case, I simply returned the keyboard."
2,"Keys are too dark, keyboard legs are cheap and broke off","It could be a pretty nice keyboard except the markings on the keys are too faint, which eventually strains the eyes, and the little pop out legs on the bottom of the keyboard are cheap and broke off, so the keyboard lies flat on the desk. The mouse is pretty nice, and now I am using the MX3200 mouse with an older Logitech wireless keyboard."
4,Good package with a couple strikes,"The one thing I don't care for about the keyboard is the little 'zoom' or 'view change' button on the left side. It is much too sensitive and even a baggy shirt can engage it. So for instance if you have your folder view set a certain way, the slightest/softest touch of this button will change the view.This button should be moved.A right-click or menu key would also be good as well as a button to light up the date/time.Other than that, the package is great.Update 5-08The mouse is acting up. When you click once, at times it acts like two clicks which is really annoying. Also when you go to drag something, it 'looses' connection with whatever your dragging and this includes attempting to highlight some text.All in all I cannot recommend this product and downgrade to 3 stars."
4,MX3200 Vista Sound Problems? Fixed,"As with some other reviewers I installed the software (latest from logitech site) for this set-up and lost the sound on my PC. I solved this by going to the device manager in my computer and updating the driver for my sound card. Vista searched the internet, installed the driver and ta-da, the sound was working again.Hope this helps anyone that has this issue.Other than that minor frustration, this is a really nice wireless desktop, with some cool features. I'm really pleased with what I got for my money."
2,Disappointed.,"I'm very disappointed with these pillow cases because i purchased them with the matching sheet set, and they are made from different fabric. -- Is there no quality control with the company (Renaissance) that makes these? I purchased the set in Brown.... the king pillow cases are a blue/grey shade of Brown, and the sheets are a very yellow shade of Brown. They look funny together on the same bed, especially in daylight.Maybe others would have better luck purchasing a different color."
4,Very nice set of sheets for the price,"These sheets are an excellent buy, but the only reason they don't get 5 stars is ... well ... they aren't the softest things right out of the box. However, I know as well as you that several washings will (hopefully) make them a little more comfy. They are, however, some excellent sheets and nice for sleeping. Just not as ""slick"" as many sateen sheets I have used in the past ... that's all. For the money, no better deal is out there. :)"
2,you get what you pay for...,"not a good product, very thin material and scratchy. I am not happy with these pillow cases at all and cannot recommend them."
1,One Size DOES NOT Fit All,"Unless you have a smaller than average steering wheel, such as in a very compact vehicle, do not purchase this cover because it will not fit. It appears to be of decent quality, but was a waste of money that will now sit on the shelf in my garage for eternity."
1,"Geeze, Solomon Tulbure Is Even a Bad Liar Now","In case anyone is wondering, the review written by a man claiming to be Solomon's former Rabbi is a fake review written by Tulbure himself. 1) Anyone who lives in Illinois (like the phony rabbi) would know that the postal abreviation for Illinois is NOT ""Ill"". It is ""Il"". 2) Most people outside Illinois know this as well. However, if you read Solomon's books, you will see one common thread that runs through it. Solomon is a lousy speller. He spells on a 5th grad level. Spelling the postal abreviation for Illinois would be something that you could easily learn to expect from Solomon. He's a nutjob. That would be another common thread running through his books. It would be fun to read this drivel if his thoughts were not so scattered. This reflects hevily in his books."
3,Illuminati and Psychiatry,"This book is incomplete and lacks the perspective of psychiatrists. It would have been more helpful to put Solomon's idea of ""telepathy"" in the light of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and mental illness. Many scientists are indeed very intelligent, but angry and very mad as well. And if this anger is unchecked, it turns into hatred and to a type of chronic madness that must be healed. George Bush can relate to this. And this is why he also needs Illuminati:Healing and Developing the Mind."
5,An Intellectual Read,"For those of you that look for an enlightened perspective on our global issues, I highly recommend this book."
1,where'd the talent go?,"This just ain't the same band that used to rock NYC in the early 90s with Evel and Hippies. This can't be the same band that that grew up at Columbia, can it?"
2,Recycling Pays -- But Not for the Reader.,"A collection of very short (typically less than 250-word) light riffs on baseball and broadcasting from this Hall of Fame radio play-by-play giant -- some are vaugely interesting, but don't expect any of gee-whiz insights into the game you'd hope for from a broadcaster of Harwell's pedigree.Disturbingly about 25% of this book contains reprints of stories and articles from his other two books. This is particularly galling considering this is such a slim large-print effort to begin with."
5,Great overview of the history of the Church,"A great book for anyone looking for an accessible introduction to the history of the Church. Shelley masters over two millennia's worth of material and relates it in bite-sized chunks that even an absolute beginner to this subject will find easy to digest. The lively and yet succinct prose masks the amount of detail that the book manages to convey and the amount of research that must have gone into it.It is worth noting that the author Bruce Shelley, who is a Senior Professor of Church History and Historical Theology, is also an evangelical Christian. The book might therefore be considered partisan in that way. Nonetheless, the various debates within the discipline have been treated fairly.I found the book extremely helpful as a general overview on the subject and as a springboard onto more in-depth studies on specific topics. The book will also be useful as a `textbook' for church history courses at churches."
4,Good primer on church history,This is the most compacted treatment of church history that is equally accurate. A great first read for anyone interested in dabbling in the history of the church.
2,Not very good...,"I always hate doing this to my own brethren but I could only read 3 hours of this. Wordy, boring and dry."
4,Long but worth it,Don't let the 1000 pages overwhelm you. This is a very readable book that objectively covers the history of the Christian Church from the post Apostles era to today.
1,"Um, is anyone worried about Al Qaeda reading this?",I stumbled upon this book when looking for the VHS for Black Hawk Down. I cannot believe that Amazon is actually selling this post 9/11. US military training manuals have been found in Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. Does Amazon think that Al Qaeda is too stupid not to look for training documents on their website? I would hate to see good soldiers die because their methods were known by the enemy.
4,Awesomeness,"The adapter was super easy to install and the connection is great. Only thing is that it'll occasionally lose connection, or go slower, but after unplugging then plugging it back in, it works just fine. :) Great deal for the price!"
1,Book is out of date,Book is out of date. Pertains to an out of date release of Maven. This Book should be pulled from shelves.
5,All Hail King Kubert!,"Before Joe Kubert performed his Tarzan of the Apes virtuoso, he had developed the Tor series in the 50's.But I think his artwork looked much better and much more roughly primitive and savage in the 70's, as in all these cover artworks.And look for the triumphant return of the Tor series coming out this summer of 08.If you like dinosaurs, cavemen, and creatures out of a lost time, then Joe Kubert's Tor is for you!"
4,"A solid, good read","Toibin has written a sincere, moving account about family frictions and resolutions in a believable manner. It's not easy to do that. The ending was satisfying without being predictable or overly sentimental."
4,Cities Do NOT Glow In Dark,"""Cities glow in the dark!"" was one of the main reasons I was interested in this item. There is *zero* glow. I promise. This was disappointing. But other than that it is a fine toy. If large cities actually glowed, it would have justified a 5-star ""educational value"" rating."
5,Great globe!!! Awesome Beach Ball!,Loved these beach ball globes. Actual NASA photos put together to create these...wonderful educational tools that every child of any age will love.
2,Starts great then...,"There is something about British Jazz that seems to embrace the 'free' element and unfortunately Graham Collier is one of them. That is for every good moment the next is disjointed noise or 'free' soloing. For the listener this proves an endurance test and i had difficulty getting through the 55 minute suite.If only the opener 'hackney five' had been the benchmark for the rest, but it isn't. The first two movements have some excellant ensemble playing and Art Themen plays a great solo and after that it is all downhill. Solo's are played alone or mesh with each other and the opening theme gets buried in the molase. I'd suggest novices go for 'songs for my father' which is coherant and accesible, but this well its just dull."
5,"WONDERFUL, - HILARIOUS AND MUSICAL","The public radio station where I worked 20 years ago had this album. I played cuts from it whenever I oculd fit them into my freeform show. My favorite is LICKS OFF OF RECORDS, but there are many wonderful tracks. I am so happy to finally find it on CD."
5,"Oh, yes!! This is what I am talkin' about!","This was one of the most heavenly sweets that has ever entered my mouth. I have ordered them twice in the past two years. I keep dreaming of getting more. My mouth is watering, just thinking about them! The only challenge is that they are not available when I come back to the site to buy them. You must sign up and wait. Oh, well, good things come to those who wait. So, here I sit."
2,WRESTLEMANIA-THE EVENT THAT STARTED IT ALL,"Don't expect much from the first WrestleMania. There wasn't much talent in the early days of wrestling. If you want to see such historical figures as Captain Lou Albano, Classie Freddie Blassie, and even Bruno Sammartino, then this video is for you. But if you're into seeing great matches, then leave this one alone and go for later WrestleManias. Still, for the first WrestleMania ever, it wasn't totally boring if it was sucessful enough to spawn numerous other WrestleManias."
4,WWF WrestleMania 1 review,"The main event tag team match between the team of Hulk Hogan & Mr.T with ""SuperFly"" Jimmy Snuka in their corner against the team of Roddy Piper & Paul Orndorff with ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton in their corner was far from a technical-wrestling classic but it did delivered in terms of entertainment. The Women's title match between Wendi Richter with Cyndi Lauper in her corner & Leilani Kai with The Fabulous Moolah in her corner was not great but pretty good. The Andre The Giant-Big John Studd-$15,000 bodyslam match was slow but still fun to watch. The World tag team title match between The US Express(Mike Rotunda & Barry Windham) against the team of Nikolai Volkoff & The Iron Sheik was a hard-hitting/solid bout. The King Kong Bundy-SD Jones match was nothing more then a one-sided flop. The rest were ok. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10."
3,Kind of the best but not.,"I am a guy that tells matches like it is, Tito vs executioner was o.k for the high flying moves,(i write reviews for good or o.k matches) The hammer vs JYD was a good classic fight, The 15,000 doller match was the best,better than the hogan/Mr.t fight, and the hogan/T bout was o.k. was all right but the best match at WM was The giant vs big john $15,000 match"
2,Think I received a dud....,Tried installing these cartridges in my labelmaker (casio) and one of the two in the pack had the black flimsy tape part of the cartridge tore and broke. Just putting it out there for everyone to make note of.
3,Not as inspiring as I expected,"I've been recently quite interested in Kabbalah, and although this book is not bad, I didn't feel as inspired as I did with God wears lipstick from Karen Berg. I think True Prosperity comes up with some business words in order to get ""business people"" involved but it fails in enlightening and giving you some peace to your soul."
2,Nothing new here,"I was a little disappointed in this book. Whilst it has all the basics covered, it did not bring any new or fresh information on manifestation and simply reiterated alot of what is in the Kaballah teachings without any new perspective or insight. I felt that it contradicts a few of the current (fabulous) books available on this subject such as Esther and Jerry Hicks teachings of Abraham - Ask and it is Given which is the best book I have ever read on this subject.All in all I felt that this little book was written to ""get on the bandwagon"" rather than produce a reference guide to prosperity."
4,Very Good,"This book focuses on a bitter sweet period of Peruvian history. Many upper class Peruvian families have not dealt with the sense of loss and abandonment that resulted from the failed land reform of the 1960's and other social experiments, the story reflects the story of the children of a family caught in a world of dissapearing privilege and a society on the verge of being dissolved. this book also has a funny twist on the internal politics of the newspaper world and is a satire on the closed world of their business deals. It is worth reading several times to catch the details of the story, if something does not make sense to the average Anerican, ask a Peruvian that lived throught teh 1970's, we can explain."
5,Slash Rocks,"Awesome TAB book. Very easy songs to master on the guitar. Compared to Guns N Roses, Slash used to be some what difficult on the guitar, but now his musics better and easier to play. Dont get me wrong, Slash's playing in Gunners rocks but it looks like that he's matured in his playing with Velvet Revolver.All songs from the album are transcribed perfectlly,(Note for Note). You wont regret this purchase."
2,Disappointingly Dull,Slow boiler about a group of prison escapees who are stranded at a depressed single woman's home has little to offer and takes way to long to do that.
3,WELL ITS VERY SIMPLE FIRST CD IS GREAT THE SECOND IS WHACK,SIMPLYALL THE 5 STARTS GIVE IT BECUZ THEY GOT MAD LOVE FOR CD 1 AND THATS IT.CD1 IS TEN TIMES BETTER THEN CD 2 VERY SIMPLY...AND FOR DOUBLE CD ALBUM IS NOT THAT GREAT AT ALL!AND FOR TUPAC AS A RAPPERWELL ITS ALL ABOUT IMAGE LIKE 50CD 1 9/10 CD 2 5.5/10OVERALL 3
2,2pac is Overrated ..........,"Sure this CD has some good tracks, however the second CD is just plain wack, the only good song on the second CD is ""all eyes on me"" the rest is all filler, Me against the world was pac's only good album, the rest of his albums are wack."
1,This CD was plain an ego tripp,The title alone reflect's what type of artist he was..media hungry..The album didn't have nothing new to offer rap just pure hypoctitism like the artist himself. I thought the album was gonna be good but it's was not that good and I got tired of listening to it like more of his recordings. I can't beleive he he disrespect producer Dr.Dre a few moth's later. Dre was a better rapper than he was as well as producer and this album was not good.
5,2pac's last cd,"one of 2pac's last cd. 2pac is one the greatest rapper ever. There are hit tracks like Can't C me, Got my mind made up,Ambitionz az a ridah,No more pain, and all eyes of me. 2pac's last album gets 5 out of 5. Rest in pain 2pac."
5,wow !!!! great cd !!!!,all evez on me iz a very good cd !!! the song that are on the cd are one of the best song of 2pac !!! so buy it !!! you won't regret it !!!
5,great album,A true masterpiece of the greatest raper/actor of all times. Inmy opinion only his Makaveli: the 7 day theorie-CD is slightlybetter.
5,The Greatest CD of all time,"2Pac is the best rapper ever, and this is his best CD this is the best cd ever. if u want a good cd collection then u must get this best song on it include 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, All About U, and Cant C Me. but every track is awesome, but those are the very best. this cd is a classic, a masterpeice, and a must have."
1,No good,2pac was the worse rapper ever!Tis' the truth that thou cannot deny!Thou art a moron if thou bought this trash!
5,pac made this cd in less than 2weeks and it's the best rap..,album ever every cd he made waz better than the next and he made the best rap/hip-hop album ever in 2 weeks emagine what we would all be bumpin if he was still here with us thats why i am so mad somebody had to take him from us i swear he would of had his own religion that would be folowed by all.he has over 10 other cds that havent even came out yet and they are just as hot as his other albums! ps. all u need to quit 2pac would not fake his own death and put his fans threw hell so stop it and let him rest...damn
4,Feeder Review,"I wanted to wait a while before giving a review. This Hummingbird feeder works well and several males fight over whose gets to use it (females of course having free reign). It doesn't refill as well as I would like - but none of them do. It also drips on its own when the ambient temperature rises, but that means the holes aren't clogged up like I've seen with other feeders.I wish it had perches - and apparently, so do some of the birds. I made some and glued them on. The birds seem to appreciate this, as I put on two (there are four feeding areas) and those are the ones the females use. I guess not having to expend energy while replenishing it works better. The males prefer the openings without the perches so they can be ready to chase off other males I presume.I also have chickadees and orioles who visit on occasion, and seem to appreciate the perches."
1,SKip This One,"I always enjoy this genre of novel and have read Mr. Poyer's other books in this series. But I just found Tomahawk to be a real bore. I think LCDR Lenson needs to get back on a ship -- the ""wars"" in Washington D.C. are just a bit too contrived."
3,Amazon suggested I review this ...,"So amazon sent me an email asking me to review this dvd. Well i never received this dvd, because of the wonderful one click address think that amazon has implemented. I moved, and changed my address on amazon. Amazon, however, defaulted to my old address for that wonderful one-click thing, and so i never got this dvd. they refunded my purchase price, which was a gold box deal. I'm not buying another one. I'm tired of this. So there is my review of this product. I hope it helped.Oh, and as far as the show goes, I love it. its an amazing show, and one that i would really like to own. perhaps someday ..."
2,The Office-The Complete Collection BBC Edition(Plus Special),"When I received the package I noticed that the dvd box had a ""dent"" in it. I assumed this occurred during shipping and didn't think too much of it. When I opened the box I saw that one of the plastic dvd holders was broken. Once again I believe it happened during the shipping process, but was still very disappointed to see the damage. When I emailed the person who sent it to me, I didn't get a response."
2,Tiresome after the first episode.,"The problem is that ""The Office"" is a one joke show. The boss thinks he's really, really funny and he isn't. Great. I get it. No, really, it's OK, I get it. You don't have to keep showing me how unfunny the boss is. No. Seriously. I get it.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because a couple of the subordinates are funny, they aren't used often enough though.You should get ""NewsRadio"" season 1 and 2 on dvd instead, it's ALWAYS funny and with greater variety than ""The Office""."
5,The Original Office,"While Michael and David are vastly different characters, you can't help but love and loathe both. Where Michael is naive, David is insecure. He wants to be loved but is so akward about getting it he makes you cringe everytime he opens his mouth. The Office antics are just as funny and it's a dead heat between Gareth and Dwight.if you love The American version, you'll equally enjoy the British Original.Gervais is a genius."
5,Brilliant,Absolutely brilliant. Funniest show in the world if you understand British humour and the monotony of office life. Full of cringe-worthy and awkward moments. It is absolutely hysterical for those who can appreciate this type of humour.
1,dont watch,"if you have seen the american version dont buy this one, same diolouge and jokes but with a english accent"
3,Best you can get.,"All I can say about this card is that I believe this is the biggest and fastest xD card on the market. It does hold a lot of pictures and I now have more room for video, about 30min worth. Although, compare to other memory card formats such as sD, this card is just okay. I think sD cards go up to 4GB+. The xD cards are coming down in price so that is a plus. I bought this card to replace a 256mb card so I must say I am enjoying the 2GB card."
1,Fuji 2GB xD Card,This product is defective. It asked you to clean it after using it once. Then it continue to have a write error message. Don't waste your money on this.
5,good so far,"so far i have had no major problems at all with my fuji type H speed xD card. It has a large capacity and seems to have no speed problems, although i never had a type M so i couldn't say for sure.. The only problem I ran into is that the Type H xD cards are not compatible with the sandisk 12 in 1 memory card readers, which is extremely frustrating."
5,Excellent product,"This is an excellent product for eyes. I have an eye disease, Fuch's Corneal Dystrophy, and this product has kept it at bay for several years now."
5,A thoroughly enjoyable read.,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I first read the book description but it sounded interesting enough... so click... and I was sure glad I decided to get this one. What a refreshing change. It had almost everything to make a good story. Almost being that it didn't have the steamy sex scenes which wouldn't have fit into this story anyway. I really love stories of women who rediscover themselves at an age when they're suppose to be comfortably happy and content with being the happy housewife and granted ,, there are many who are.,, but this was one who wasn't. And instead of staying in a life of unhappiness, she chose to change it. The scenes were vivid and the interactions between the characters was totally believable. Made me feel like I was sitting at the bar with them all. The twists of the story were great. I have already recommended this to some of my friends. Hope they get it and enjoy it as much as I did."
3,"If some assembly scares you, move on...","If I see some assembly required I break into hives, but when I saw the other reviews I thought 15 to 20 minutes would be bearable. Needless to say I'm not handy!First, I couldn't find the instructions. They were in a little plastic ball the size of a baby's fist with the dowels and the screws and almost ended up in the garbage. Fortunately it does snap together rather intuitively. The dowels are hard to line up and the screws don't catch.This was a gift for my dad for his 83rd birthday. We ended up putting it together. I would have never been able to put it together myself. Total assembly time was 2 and half hours.It is a beautiful bench and the wood is lovely.... but all you assembly-phobes beware!Karen"
2,Super fast as described.,"I meant to chose 4 Star rating but when I went to review it was on 2 and then I couldn't change it.Overall happy with the product. The ""toast"" setting doesn't do both sides evenly, but I just flip the bread to toast the other side. (I wanted to get my old toaster off my small counter). Does a great job with frozen food products. Anxious to try it in the winter when I cannot use my gas grill. A good purchase."
4,wonderful oven,we purchasec this item after looking at others. for the price i think it was a good deal. it does everything i wanted. there is only two of us so a small oven was what i wanted. be sure to watch the video and read the boklet. i am really impressed with the performance. we still have amicrowave but this oven will do the work of my large oven. saves on electicity. only had a short time but will continue to use daily.
2,Hate this contraption!,I have owned this for about 6 months now and it is kind of useless in my opinion. The learning curve to operate this thing is ridiculous and it really doesn't seem to cook my food any faster. I put in some frozen mushroom bites recently and the outside burned and the inside was still frozen! I wish that I had sprung for a convection...
2,miscasting galore!,"Adrien Brody as an action hero is like casting Wally Cox as Superman! And that sorry Clint Eastwood impression? This miscasting ruined what could have been a decent action adventure film. Sorry, but that merits a loss of 3 stars alone... Topher Grace played it just creepy enough to pull off a psychotic murderer, but it wasn't much of a surprise, when after all, all the others were supposed to be some major bad-ass merc... so a doctor, very out of place and predictable! So very sad because they could have focused on the new kind of predator that Fishburn's character spoke of... by the way, when he showed up one hour into the film, I said to myself, finally an actor that makes me believe he's a bad-ass... the rest just made me feel I was watching a bunch of pre-adolescents pretending in the back yard!!! Ugh!"
2,Predators,"I am unable to view this DVD; I receive the message ""check regional code"" on my DVD player. I can view the DVD on my lap top computer. Can you help?"
3,Okay movie!,"Just watched this long weekend.It was okay,it just wasn't great as the other two.Predator one will always be my favorite!"
1,"It ain't ""Aliens""","By adding ""s"" to the title, I had some delusion that it might (just might) reimagine the Predator universe like ""Aliens"" did for ""Alien"". Nope. Nothing interesting, new, or fun. The predators were even boring and dumb. Nothing very ""predatory"" and cunning about them. Just cloaking, missles, and big blades. Remember the guilty-pleasure, comic book drama and action of the first movie? None of that here. Just over wrought acting, poor storytelling, mediocre CGI.....ultimately, a wasted 2 hours for a critical sci fi fan. Avoid."
2,Padded Remake With Boring Story,"No matter how they try to dress it up, this is just a remake of the first Predator.Why didn't they have more Predators no longer hunting humans on the streets of earth, but a massive full scale war with the army and the twist being they now can take on our form and also they need our women to mate to carry on their race and plan to take over our planet, that would have been more exciting. I tried to enjoy this film but it was so tacky and cliche ridden I thought why the heck did they even bother.What should have been an all out assault on our senses is just a let down making this the perfect example of just how much hollywood is short changing fans.Let's hope this is the last Predator sequel, as it looks like leftovers from Outlander and Avatar.Worth a watch if you must but it's no worthy addition, Predator 2 is still the best of the Predator sequels."
2,"One Word: ""Eh...""","First off, I still have yet to see the Predators actually look as bad-ass as they looked in Predator and Predator 2, sleek and organic. In AVP2, I'll give it credit, the Predator looked sleek and cool, but his face looked like an anvil fell on his face. AVP 1 and Predators, the Predators look like a bunch of overweight ex-wrestlers.Doesn't live up to those old suits, sorry. Also, where are the Predators in this movie? They're barely in this movie! I could care less about a bunch of multi-cultural merceranies on their way to try and create the first film.This movie may have been in the respect that it got people back into Predators the franchise, but just weak. Topher Grace did a good job, go figure, the guy without any guns.Predator and Predator 2 are still king."
3,Not bad as far as Alien/Predator sequels have recently been.,"Predators is a nice return to form in many aspects. It brings the Predator franchise back to it's roots rather than continuing the rather lackluster performance of the past Alien vs. Predator sequels. While this film is nowhere near as good as the first predator film it is still a nice, fun, romp into the predator universe. None of the characters are terribly deep or all that complex and could even be accused of being rather two-dimensional, but for a fun action/horror film like this I'd argue they really don't need to be. As long as you don't go into Predators expecting a terribly deep film you'll end up enjoying it for what it is: A decent return to what is at the heart of the predator franchise."
3,Not as good as the first but vastly superior to the rest,"First off let me say that the original Predator movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. So this movie had little chance to blow my socks off. However, it was a pretty decent movie. The story kept me interested. It gave props to the first movie and all of the characters were at the very least decent."
3,Better than the alien x predator...,"Predators in my opinion is way better than the alien x predator movies...This movie is actually cool, but i think is way too long...they could cut easilly 20 minutes of the time lenght... I see PREDATORS 4 or 5 times and it's ok...but stick with the first 2 PREDATOR movies, that are completelly classics!!!"
4,Nice watch great price,I wanted an analog perpetual calendar watch and this one fit the bill nicely. Great price!!
2,photos of fish,This book was a of little use to me so I passed it on the the thrift store. A much better book on fish faces is Fishface by David Doubilet published by www.Phaidon.com. Hundreds of spectacular photosshane

3,Review,Product was ok - I thought it was a new cd but it was used. It was a gift for someone else though.
5,3 Cheers for great music,I am a Civil War re-enactor and I love this soundtrack. I was going to a re-enactment and I was listening to this wile I was setting up my tent and I stopped and looked out at my friends and the music mixed with the picture brought a tear to my eye.
3,Not Very Happy for the Cost,It was doing okay until the last tape wouldn't feed correctly. The black ribbon kept popping out when I wanted to print. I even rolled it before installing it into the machine just like the directions said to. That worked fine for the other 3 now I can't continue my labels. Is there a way I can get a partial refund?Not Happy :(
1,how long is this?,nice to know that this is made from consumer trash. Real useful info--NOT!how about telling me something useful like how long this tape it? Have found Casio replacement parts to be expensive for what they give you. Cant be bothered to provide product specifications?
4,A Good Book!,"I think this book is a all right type of book. I know life has its struggles, but there is nothing worth running away from. I believe it was a couldn't keep the book down group, but I believe nothing is worth running away from."
4,Cole's Opinion of Runaway Ralph,"Runaway Ralph is a good book. Ralph lives in the Mountain View Inn in a hole by the grandfather clock. He eats many snacks like popcorn, and his favorite was peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I liked it when Ralph set up an obstacle course for his motorcycle.I think 8-year-old boys would like this book because it has a lot of adventure in it."
4,Dialogue,"This film is incendiary, polarizing, engrossing, and at times sensationalistic. But I'm grateful for it. Whether or not you agree that America should adopt a universal health care program, I'm hoping that people like Moore bringing the topic into the mainstream will help perpetuate a dialogue about American health care, which, I think most people can agree, seems to be heading quickly to ruin.What the film does a good job of pointing out is that there seems to be a fundamental conflict between the health care profession, which is about healing and preventing illness, and the business world. Insurance companies make more money when they are able to find ways to deny people's claims. The result is the kind of horror stories that ""Sicko"" puts on display."
4,Sicko makes a point,"The Michael Moore movie Sicko may not be for everyone. But for those of us that appreciate a good documentary and are of liberal minds, this is an excellent film. This was purchased to be given as a gift. The person receiving it was extremely pleased.There are parts of this movie that are to be taken with a grain of salt. But for the most part, Michael Moore gives you something to think about. There are alternate ways of providing healthcare for people of the U.S."
5,Great documentary,"Another great Michael Moore documentary (keep in mind, it is a documentary, so he of course uses some controversial techniques to get his point across). An important film to see in light of the current debates on healthcare reform."
4,Sicko,"I had to review this movie for an ethics assignment. It was my second time seeing it and I enjoyed it very much. Keep in mind, it is Michael Moore's perspective and although some people think it is propaganda, I think he did a fine job at getting his point across."
1,FATSO,A fatso who is ten calories away from a coronary is running... walking around criticizing the health care system. Am I the only one who sees the stupidity in this?
5,Make sure your legislators see this!,"After viewing this film I felt ashamed to be American. See it, then demand that your legislators go see it. In fact, suggest to everyone you know to see this movie. Moore's latest film is shocking, eyeopening, a wave of cold water that should wake us up to what needs to be done."
5,Sicko,"Product was in great condition, the case appeared brand new and so did the CD no scratches and it arrived very fast, I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,"very, very important movie about health care in the US","Whether you like Moore or not, I think every American should see this movie. It shows us what's possible with our wealth: Making sure every American (including children) has the opportunity to be healthy. It's pathetic that the US is the only country that doesn't provide this basic right to people. Really makes one think..."
3,Not worth every effort to read unless you've read rest of Dickens first,"Difficult to get your head round and finish unless you really love Dickens - which I do. This is not one of his best and so by Dickens' standards a failure. It was the last novel he finished and it lacks the optimism and wit of many of his other works. If you have to read this for study purposes, good luck to you. If for leisure, I personally would read another Dickens, say David Copperfield, Hard Times, Great Expectations, Pickwick Papers, Bleak House or Little Dorrit."
3,Its Ok.,"This thing isn't as good as it looks,the problems with it are it has a very narrow viewfinder and its magnified (zoomed in) to one point meaning its not adjustable, and you have to manually focus it which is really annoying.Since this thing is electronic it should have autofocus and zoom in/out.I'm giving this 3 stars because regardless of the above this thing is very professional grade (Made in Russia) and unlike regular Night Vision this is digital so you can use it day or night without damaging it,also it has a video jack to hook it up to a TV and the IR illuminator is really nice. But for the most part,aside from the Night Vision and it being electronic,its just another spotting scope."
4,"Good stuff, missing some things though.",Its a great product for the price. Good build quality. Decent performance. Simple to operate.I wish it had automatic focus.
5,Great Price,For the price this carafe is fantastic. It looks great on my table when I have a luncheon. The soft color adds a character to the setting.
1,Save your money!,"Bought this on advice from a friend - good thing is, he's still my friend. This is a great sounding piece, but the ear clip and rubber inserts are terrible. Broken two ear clips already - they snap off if you look at them bad. The rubber ear insert does not lock tightly into place, and is always falling off (never put this thing in your pocket!). To switch ears, you have to dismantle it (remove ear clip - which may break)."
1,Defective Product - returned,"I have bought 3 of these items for employees and they are all wonderful. BUT, this one, which is the ONLY one in bulk packaging, was poor with lots of static. I don;t know if the different packaging effected the product (unlikely) , but I did return this item and instead of a replacement, I got the refund and used it to buy the same item in the standard packaging. The price is the same (within a couple of bucks)."
5,Works Great and is Durable,"The only reason I bought this unit was that it provided excellent noise cancellation. I work in very loud industrial facilities and travel through airports routinely. The Jawbone makes it possible to have clear conversations in places where it was completely impossible. As far as comfort and looks; not even a consideration for me. I have no problem wearing it as long as needed for conversations. It can easily be changed to use on either ear. The only ""piece"" that can fall off is a small rubber cover that conceals the charging contacts. I took it off because I don't care what it looks like. I would have never bought any earpiece if it had not been for the noise cancelling ability of this one. I've recommended that our fire brigades consider using these to be able to communicate in noisy industrial plants during emergencies."
4,this is the best Bluetooth headset,"This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality! The ear clip should be redesigned. I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality. You must remember the sensor has to touch your face while you talk. In windy place or while walking: this headset is not too good. Otherwise, it is really the best one on the market for sound quality with out the background noise."
2,"Looks good, but doesn't work well at all!","Unfortunately, the military-grade sound cancellation feature didn't work as advertised. People on the other end of the phone could hear my car radio, wind noise, etc. I even tried to press the bluetooth next to my face to get a good fit. The noise cancellation still didn't work.Additionally, the sound quality was poor when using the ear buds that came in the package. I switched out the ear buds with Jabra ear gels. This worked well, but maybe too well. The sound went from being very low to excruciatingly high. The Jawbone's minimal range in volume control made it impossible to find a comfortable setting.Overall, buying the Jawbone was a big mistake! I never write reviews online, but the product was so bad that I was forced to."
4,"Good, but could be better!!!","In addition to the Jawbone, I've owned two other Bluetooth headsets from Motorola (HS 810 & HS 850).Likes: Overall, the old Jawbone is the best one yet. It fits better, sound quality is better, and is more comfortable compared with Motorola headsets. The noise reduction of the Jawbone is superior.Dislikes: It's bulky. The rubber earbud makes my ear itch like crazy sometimes. The earloop is not easy to quickly put on your ear and I've broken two earloops already in the past year of ownership. (it comes with 2 for the right and 2 for the left).Fortunately, Aliph has just come out with the new Jawbone, which is slimmer, smaller, and the earloops look easier to slide on your ear. Check it out at http://www.jawbone.comAlso, Aliph still supports the old model. You can buy spare earloops and earbuds. Trust me, you will need extra earloops. I'll keep replacing them until they stop supporting the old Jawbone. Then I'll probably pull the trigger on the new model."
2,Great disappointment,"just very disappointed with this product. no matter what, the ear bud with any provided pad, simply does not fit my ear. (any other ear bud does). the clasp that is supposed to fit around the ear also simply does not, and in fact one of them broke because the metal is very brittle!worst of all was the sound quality. low volume with or without the noise cancellation. finally, the odd way the buttons worked, dialing the last number instead of activating -- bad idea and again not the general way other ear buds operate (so it's confusing). i would not recommend this product, overhyped and underwhelming."
2,JAWBONE,"I bought this at theAT&T; store. The noise reduction deal works, but the device itself doesn't stay on your ear well at all."
1,Shipping Stinks,"States that it is ""in stock"", but now earliest estimate is 8 weeks. Great customer service! Will never order from them again."
1,military pipe bomb,I have used a Blutooth headset Now for 4 years actualy had the first one made by jabra : Now i said this to set Up what I am about to say . this earpice is garbage Dont By it Dont Consider the the Noise Cancling its A Joke I sent mine back after 1 week very unhappy.
2,Crashed and burned,"I was very excited about the Aliph Jawbone when I first used it. Alas, although it may block ambient environmental interior noise, such as music, or nearby conversations, it does NOT block wind noise, causing crackling on both ends of a conversation. If you are outside, forget it. Additionally, the ear hook snapped off at the base, leaving a piece inside the unit. Emails to the company were unresponded to. For $100 and two month's usage, this is spectacularly disappointing."
3,Great and awful,"I, like many people, have many bluetooth devices which I disliked greatly. My husband bought me this one and as far as the noise, the sound of calls and weight, I absolutely love it. It's by far the best.It's downfall is in the durability. I do handle it with kid-gloves but the cap on the end gets stuck in the charger piece and it now won't charge. The piece falls off while it's on my ear. I'm disappointed in the construction. I emailed the company an hour ago, so I can't say if they'll stand behind their product."
4,Wonderful,"I was dog sitting for a friend, and bought this harness to help me control her very enthusiastic and VERY strong pit bull mix. The change was immediate. He settled right in, and didn't pull when we walked. It made the whole experience much more pleasant for both of us. The only down side was trying to size it...I wasn't 100% sure I had fit correctly...but either way - it still works."
4,A good guide for the beginner ethical hacker.,"There is alot of good knowledge to be learned in this book, but it is very cutthroat and dry. There are almost no ""real world"" examples of what they talk about, and alot of it talks about using programs that were created for linux.. Otherwise it is a good book, but I have read better."
5,A great movie for kids!,"This is a cute story that both of my boys enjoyed watching. We initially purchased the dvd years ago. When my eleven year old got a Kindle for christmas, this was the first movie that he purchased!"
1,A pointless dud,"This movie is just about some kid who wants to copy a famous basketball player,that's all.The acting is terrible,there is no plot,and the whole movie was just one big endorsement for Lil Bow-Wow.Don't watch this movie-rent ""Space Jam"" instead."
5,A Good Movie!!!!,Like mike is a really good movie because it`s a story about an orphan who lives in a group home. And it was a bully who tried to take his sneakers and he threw it on top of a power line. Then he Calvin tried take them off and then the shoes got electrocuted and it gave the shoes a lot of power. He was selling candy to a coach and he gave him a $20 dollar bill and he went to the staples center. He got lucky when they picked him to play Tracy Reynolds. And he never missed a shot. The ending part was really good because Tracy adopted Calvin and Merph. I read some people reviews and they was hatin on it. (...) I`ve seen it a thousand times.
3,Not your common basketball movie.,"For Lil Bow WOW's first movie it's great but for a basketball it is not so good.It's cool that they got all those pro basketball players like Jason Kidd and David Robinson but it dosn't seem any good for a basketball movie.This can't compare to some basketball movies out there.This one isn't as based around basketball as most others,this one is based around Lil Bow Wow finding Michale Jordan's shoe's and being able to play like MJ.I guess it's good for little kid's who like Lil Bow Wow but not for people who want to see it because it is a basketball movie.Take my advice,it is not that good."
4,My Second One,"We bought our first several years ago, and it was reliable and made very good coffee by our standards. We really liked the thermal carafe, and we always filled the carafe with hot water the night before which we believe helps keep the coffee hot long into the morning.But, I killed it one day. Not realizing that I had a carafe of warm water sitting under the filter, I added a potful of water to the reservoir, turned it on, and ended up drowning the thing. Water overflowed the pot and got into the electronics, and the digital controls failed to function after that. So, I was delighted to see that the identical model is still for sale on Amazon. I ordered it, we are using it, and we love it -- but now I make sure I empty that pot before I turn it on!"
1,Disappointed,"The whole purpose of a carafe is to keep the coffee hot. Not with this coffee maker. Unless you drink all 8 cups right after brewing, your coffee will be luke-warm at best. We returned ours after 3 days. I'm assuming that the more expensive models work better."
5,What's the problem?,"I don't understand the bad reviews for this product. I asked my wife to get a non-glass coffemaker because I am tired of breaking the glass coffee carafe when I wash it. I always end up buying a new coffeemaker because the price difference is close enough between a replacement carafe and brand new machine to opt for the latter. Coffee tastes good, coffee kept hot, easy to understand instructions. The arrows on the lid let you know where to position the lid for pouring and closing. Maybe if I needed a coffee pot that lasted over four hours this would be a bad deal, but all I need is for it to last maximum 2 hours, long enough for morning coffee with my wife on weekends and quick cup out the door before work days. I am confused by the negative reviews. Just make sure the lid is closed between coffee pours. No problem with cleaning, just wash in warm dish water. Also I followed the direction and ran clear water through before first use."
2,Lukewarm and watered down...,"We have whole beans at work which we grind every morning and brew thru a wonderful Bunn coffee maker. My desire for similar quality coffee at home led me to this machine. Following the first brew, my initial impression was that the coffee was very lukewarm and weak. With every subsequent brew, I adjusted the recipe - using more grounds, grinding longer, using more water (to let the grounds ""cook"" longer), preheating the carafe, etc. While I figured out how to make stronger coffee, at the end of the day it still had that watered down consistency. The best results I got were from grinding enough beans to make 10 cups (according to the grinder's fill level) but it seemed like a waste of money to use that much when all I really wanted was 1-2 cups a day.I came to the conclusion that the water just doesn't get hot enough to brew a proper pot of coffee and after toying with it for 1.5 weeks I returned it and bought a Cuisinart."
1,basically throwing away coffee,"The holes that drip the hot water onto the grounds are about 1 inch around, the surface are they need to cover is about 3 inches around. Guess what? not all the grounds get hot water on them, they remain dry. Wastes coffee, money and makes mediocre coffee. Drawn in by the low price but will eventually will cost more because I will have to replace it with something better."
4,"Mother, child care provider, musician gives thumbs up","While the high pitched flute may not be for everyone, theconcept is outstanding, and the children's minds are responding.Claims of superior spatial reasoning, brain development, coordination, and musical ability have not only been proven, but are widely and absolutely accepted and practiced among concerned, educated society. For further information, look up music education, early child development--music, or Montessori teaching techniques. While these selections may not be the most asthetically pleasing to some, others consider their children's future more important than their own music preference. ""You can please all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time. But you can never please all the people all the time.""--Abraham Lincoln"
2,NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED!,"After purchasing his 2006 release i was hooked...that was my first time hearing a white guy come that hard/thoughtful, and it made me purchase every single CD from APAHY. Although this is true...this was weak next to Eastern Philosophy, I mean real weak. I listen to it and in every songs his mentions pus**, Hoes, and getting his d*ck sucked. He had more opened mind on Eastern Philosophy. I must admit there are some tracks that were pretty good....but this could have been way better. If you ask me, Dont buy it buy Eastern Philosophy!"
1,Do Not Buy This Software Package,"I also use Punch Pro and all I wanted was a basic package to sketch simple floor plans. Total 3D can't even do that. You can't choose the direction of a staircase. As another reviewer said, this software package is a rip off !!!! DO NOT BUY IT."
2,Repeats main theme,"Main music theme repeated too often throughout, and the wonderful Irish tune """"I'll Tell Me Ma"" was excluded."
1,Cheesecake may spoil during delivery,"I got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift, and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice. It was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge.The second cheesecake arrived spoiled. They did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit. When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery. And on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged, other companies were very willing to make it up to me. Amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction."
2,Old ones good. New ones crummy,"I had an old pair from probably 2008 or so. Excellent protection and quality. That is until my dog Jake ate the left one. So I buy a new pair and instead of thick wad padding there's only thin material lining now. And since I still have the right glove from 2008, I did hot test and the new ones lose big time. Booo for cheap chinsey gloves. Lodge aren't much better either."
4,""" you'll get your eye poked out!""","This novel was interesting and entertaining but after I read it I found myself thinking "" what was the point of what I just read?"". Though I enjoyed Mark Childress's style of writing and creativity, I didn't feel as enthroughled or as involved as when I read other books this year (ie. Handmaid's tale, or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest). This was so evidently a work of fiction and so I found it harder to let it take over my life."
1,crazy in alabama,"I did n ot enjoy this book, in fact I did not finish it.Maybe it was because I am an Alabamian.Purchased it from Amazon."
3,"Good, but not for school.","I gave the book three stars because I didn't think it worked out in a school setting. If I were to have read it on my own I may have enjoyed it a little more. The book wasn't bad at all. I didn't really like Lucille's chapters. They were somewhat far-fetched. But other than those few things, the book was okay."
5,Remarkable!,"The story is totally off the wall, but the characters involved make it totally believable. You will fall in love with Peejoe, and applaud Lucille. The story of racism which ties the whole book together is remarkable. A definite must read."
2,Moisture prone,"I bought a set of these lights in May and installed them on my truck. I didn't use the LED light, only the white light. By August I had moisture in one of the lights and wrote to Amazon who promptly sent me a replacement set for free, simply return the old lights within 30 days. No problem, their customer service was great through email. The new lights arrived quick and I installed the same day. Within a week the new lights have moisture in them. We're talking about standing water inside of the lens kind of moisture. At this point it's just money lost, disappointed. I'd like to return them for money back but don't have my original packaging or anything else. I wouldn't recommend these lights for anybody who drives in any kind of rain."
4,"Pilot Performance Lighting PL-1058M Pilot 5"" x 2"" Rectangular Driving Light w/ 7 Color L.E.D. Accent Light","Pilot Performance Lighting PL-1058M Pilot 5"" x 2"" Rectangular Driving Light w/ 7 Color L.E.D. Accent Light just installed them and tested the light 5 times and now the light switch will not turn offcalled seller and they are sending me out part next week hope it last when they did work they looked cool"
2,disappointed,After reading the reviews for this product I thought I'd give it a try -- the bra did not fit well at all so back it went!
4,Great Game A little Buggy,When I bought this game i loved it my computer fit the profile perfectely but when i was playing the game would freeze up it froze up and the computer froze up all the time.However it could of been the drivers in my computer but im not sure it might not do it for all.But i just know I have a highly upgraded system and it was doing this.On gameplay Ide give 100 stars but if it didnt have that bug i would of gaven it full 5 stars.Other than that very great game.
2,Well...umm....,"First of all let me just say that if you liked cossacks you'll like this game to.Personally, I hate 'build-fest' games where the number of units you build is much more important than strategy or tactics.I much prefer Medieval Total War to this game.Multiplayer suffers from horrible lag, I don't know what the deal is with that.Indian units have rediculously low morale: I am affended by this because the Indians were defending their homeland, and they were brave warriors. They would not run in fear. But what can you expect? The developers was made by a german company. Issues surrounding customer support for english speakers abound, as they do not make patches for english versions of the game."
4,Handy and Complete,"Definitely a very good reference guide for any freshwater enthusiast. The mini-atlas has every freshwater species beautifully diplayed in color photo. Under each color photo is a group of symbols. These symbols are defined in the book itself. The symbols convey what water conditions are appropriate, size of tank, food, swimming level, breeding type and level of aggression. The mini-atlas also has separate chapters on breeding, fish diseases, aquarium plants and tank set-up.The only negative point is that each fish is called by its scientific name. If you desire to know the common name (the name used in aquarium shops) you have to go to the back of the book and search an index of scientific names which then refers to the common name. This process is a bit cumbersome.All in all, this book is a nice addition to one's personal freshwater library. It's very complete and I find myself referring to it often."
5,Absolutely gorgeous!!!,This box is absolutely magnificent!! Even better than it appears in online photos.
1,Too Much Hype,"I recieved this album as a promo from my place of employment and since I have a pretty eclectic range of music tastes, I thought I would try it out. I was dissappointed to the point of disgust.there is only one decent track on the albumn which is Breathe (2AM), the rest is just a collection of tracks which are over produced and all sound alike.Anna has a decent voice, but shows no absolutly no range of talent which she may or may not have, proving the fact that the music industry would rather have a pretty face and marketability then knock your socks off talent.On a final note the write ups I read on this album boast the production of Eric Rosse. (Who produced the first 3 Tori Amos albums incuding Y Kant Tori Read) I believe that that this album proves that Tori made Eric Rosse and not the other way around."
1,major bummer,"This is a great CD to listen to if you're in the mood for slitting your wrists. Anna Nalick has a wonderful voice - incredible, in fact - but virtually every song is sad. Extremely so. Two or three would have been plenty. But the listener - at least this one - can only take so much angst. Even Sarah McLachlin mixes it up more than this woman."
1,Mature yet lacking,"When I first heard 2am I thought it was Jennifer Knapp of Christian Comtenporary Music. Then I realized it was way too nieve and grade school for Jennifer Knapp. Her voice is nice at times, but needs more polish. I dont hate the album, but I dont like it either."
5,"Excellent book, entertaining read","This is the best book on hostess clubs that I've read. It was entertaining, informative from a first persons perspective without being biased. If you are interested in the Japanese nightlife get this book."
4,Great for fans or people on a budget.,"I bought this combo pack strictly for Knights of the old Republic which is a great RPG. If you are a star wars fan this is a must have. The main point of the game is being able to chose light side or dark side actions through the entire game. Some of the actions affect the main story line where other atcions just result in items that you recieve or simply moving further to the dark side or the light side. Kind of long though. Depending on what you are looking for that good be good or bad.All of the other games are just a bonus. Battle Front is really fun which lets you play through all the major battles from all the movies as soldiers themselves. The games are out dated now though. Most of them have sequels, but if you are a fan and looking for a cheap buy this is definately a good choice."
1,Do not buy if you have Windows 7,"If you are running windows 7 on a newer PC than I would not suggest you buy this package. I was only able to get 2 of the 5 games to work, Battlefront and Republic Commando. Both of those games were pretty good and I did enjoy them, however you can buy each of them separately for much less than this package.I really bought this for Knights of the Old Republic but that game will not function on Windows 7. When I contacted LucasArts support they told me they would not help me and I could research it on my own. Never one time did the support representative give their name or sign an e-mail. This is VERY dissapointing as I've heard a lot of good things about Knights of the Old Republic, and I wanted to play this in preparation of ""The Old Republic"" being released at the end of the year. Now I'm not so sure I'll do that given my poor experience with LucasArts."
1,Waited so long for it to not even be usable,I waited longer than normal for this go get here which i was ok with because i was incredibly excited for it. turns out it was missing the discs. its a computer game. they literally sent me the case. cant send it back because i have to pay for that myself so i might as well just buy a new one
4,Lucas Arts does not support Windows Vista,All of the games are fun to play and I really liked Jedi Knights of the Old Republic. Old Republic does crash frequently so save often. I emailed Lucas Arts and they said that Vista was not tested and that I was on my own.
3,Forbidden Colours,My college roommate bought this when it was released. I have always loved the Forbidden Colours version with David Sylvian's vocals. A real gem of a song.
3,Very bulky,"This case is very nice, well constructed, and I'm sure it would make a great case for a lot of people. I found the case to make my already large phone too bulky. It makes the phone about twice as thick, and a little wider. I wasn't comfortable with the plastic belt clip as I have had other clips like this that have broken in the past. I do not want to have my $500 phone falling off my belt into a puddle.If you are not concerned with size, this has very good construction. The magnetic snap is very cool, and you can access all of the buttons and plugs with this installed."
4,Blister,"Blister by Susan Shreve is a sad, powerful book about a ten-year old girl named Alyssa Reed. Alyssa is spunky girl with a lot of attitude. But when her mom's baby dies, her whole world turns upside down. Her mom can't stop crying, and her father moves himself into a separate apartment. So Alyssa decides that it is time for some action. She renames herself Blister and ""borrows"" some clothes from her dad's new girlfriend. Blister is angry that her father just left them when they needed him, but learns to accept the fact he wants a new life. If your family has ever been affected by a bad situation, you will really understand and relate to Alyssa. Blister, is a captivating book, and I recommend it to anyone who loves to read a heartwarming tale.-Sheerin Gryloo"
2,Blister,"Alyssa Reed is a young girl that is ten years old. Her parents are looking forward to a new baby on the way. The baby is baby girl, her name will be Lila Rose. When her mom went to the hospital, she came back very, very sad. Little Lila was born a Stillborn. Days after that her mommy and daddy where very sad, they started fighting alot! Her daddy moved them to a bigger town then what they are use to. He also moved into an apartment of his own. He also has a new girlfriend. Now that her parents are apart, she totally changes her look, attitude, and her name. She renames her self Blister .The main character is Alyssa Reed also know as Blister. She is ten years old and she has red hair like a bright red apple. She has freckles, and blue eyes.I really, truly did not like this book. I didn't like it because it had no mystery in it. I would though recommend this book to another person, if they like reality. This book is a really good book for people who like to read this sort -of thing."
3,Check it out from your library...,"This book was okay. It was kind of unrealistic, though. First, Alyssa decides to change her name to Blister for no reason, then she decides to steal her dad's girlfriend's clothes. It was weird. I wouldn't spend my money on it."
2,Very gloomy,"Still born baby sister, Dad's affair, Mom's depression. and divorce. These topics can be interesting for adults, but this book offers no wisdom for children to understand. I wouldn't recommend this unless you are ready to explain them to your child by yourself."
4,Elastic girl!,"Susan Shreve's Blister is a serious, dramatic fiction with twists of humor.Blister is about a girl named Alyssa Reed whose baby sister dies. Trying to overcome the loss, her mother stays in bed all day sobbing, and her father moves out with a new girlfriend. Alyssa's way of coping is hilarious. Blister is tragic, but it is also funny. It is just like in our everyday lives; some days go wrong and some are fantastic.It is a great discussion book for 4th to 6th graders. The author captures moments of sadness as well as humor. Alyssa's ""out-there"" personality makes you laugh. You will ask yourself, ""Am I elastic?"" With an unexpected event or two, Shreve does an excellent job of making the story come alive."
2,Terrible Recording of the Barber,"I will disagree with the other reviewers here. The Barber is a wonderful piece, dreadfully and lifelessly performed here. The chorus has no emotion. The recording is unfocused...the strings sound absolutely amateurish throughout. Schenck's work on Koch is much superior, even though rough at the edges; it bristles with electricity, and the soprano is just perfect for the second section."
4,Rich and evocative,"This unusual book, written in a minimalist style, conveys broad themes, emotions and imagery and succeeds in inducing a kind of pleasant reverie in the reader. While not for everyone, this books offers a great deal to the reader who is willing to drift with its dream-like and poetic prose. It is highly recommend."
2,i like sarah polley,"i watched this movie because i am a huge fan of sarah polley's. and once agian i wasn't dissapointed by her acting. polleys beautifully casted as a confused high classed twenty one year old woman with low self esteem named harper. what was so great with polley in this film was her ability to act with her face alone. her characters emotions were never in doubt. its just a shame that her counterpart stephen rea couldn't do the same. rea plays a bohemian artist that ""recruits"" women half his age and teaches them to be like himself in a way. i felt as if he had the same drab face on all the time, which makes it very hard for the audience to feel sympathy for his characters. this film had its good moments, including a hilarius scene at the dinner table of harper's house. but all in all, there wasn't anything to entertain the audience. no one really cares about any of the characters. and with a totally useless ending, this movie is not recommended."
4,GREAT!!!!!,"I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE DID IT TO ME AGAIN. THIS BOOK IS GREAT. I LOVE IT. I COULD HARDLY PUT IT DOWN. THE CHARACTER AND THE PLOT KEPT ME IN SUSPENSE. I COULDN'T HARDLY CONTAIN MYSELF. I ALMOST FLIP TO THE END OF THE BOOK JUST SO THAT I COULD FIND OUT HOW EVERYTHING GOES. TO SEE IF EVERYONE TURNS OUT OKAY. TO SEE IF HE STILL RULE OR NOT. TO FIND THE ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING AND ALL MY QUESTIONS.THIS IS ONE BOOK I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO READ BUT READ DEVILS EMBRACE FIRST THEN THIS ONE. THAT WAY YOU WON'T GET CONFUSE AS TO WHAT HAPPEN TO WHOM, WHAT, WHY, WHERE, WHEN, ALL THE 5 W'S AND THE HOW'S. TRUST ME!! READ DEVILS EMBRACE YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS HOW ALL THIS CAME TO BE."
5,*NOT AS GOOD AS DEVIL'S EMBRACE BUT STILL A *5*,"As I said with ""Devil's Embrace"", people should lighten up. In those years in history, most men were barbarians. They for the most part treated women light trash, no better than dogs. In fact, they treated their pets better than they did their women. If you are a historical romance reader, you take this in stride as the way things were then.I found this book to be very ""INTENSE"" and hated to have to put it down to do other things. As one reviewer stated, would have been nice to have Adam & Arabella to have their own stories, but it worked out fine this way, as Adam came to rescue Arabella with Rayna. The way she had the children of the main characters of ""Devil's Embrace"" come together was wonderful. Truly enjoyed it."
1,on beyond dysfunctional,"In over 20 years of computing I have never worked with a worse piece of software. Downloading updated forms was nearly impossible - took four hours, with multiple freezes and re-boots, to finally get just two simple forms. In one quarter of that time I did my whole business return by hand. Never again. Never again."
1,This software is the worst that I have ever used!,"It's funny, I'm actually a CPA who specializes in tax compliance. I usually use Lacerte software from Intuit, but I moved and had to finish my partnership at home. I bought TaxCut, and I figured that it would be fine since I'm familiar with taxes. I was wrong, it was full of problems, very difficult to navigate your way around. The partners capital didn't generate to the K-1's correctly. I finally got it all worked out, but it was a pain, especially for an easy partnership. Anyway, I'll be going to TurboTax for everything next year. They have always been better to me."
4,Light but thought provoking.,"Somewhat hard to get, this book is worth at least a read-through. Once the main characters, after adventuring through the stars, find a home on which they can settle, they still must integrate into a society that has dichotomies of high-tech and religious fanaticism in between attacks by aliens from a nearby black hole. A Very nicely woven story that give good visual images."
2,Not as good as the first,"I didn't like this album as much as volume 1. I think some of the fire is gone. However it does have some limited apeall. I liked the version of ""Pictures of Lilly""."
3,Instructions,"This book is NOT for someone who is not in tune with Qabala.I am still looking for instructions HOW TO.For someone who is deep in to study of Qabala it may be OK, however simple instructions would have been a great help."
5,A MUST OWN,"Although I have seen, memorized placement, and studied all I could find on this sparcely written subject, I never could really pull it all together in my mind in a cohesive manner. Many have tried to speculate on this subject in different ways which has made it very confusing. If you follow the writings of Paul Foster Case, this will be one of those books always in arms reach. The dimensions are laid out in a very understandable and integrative way that almost make it instantaneously easier to follow than the tree. I can see why BOTA gave it their stamp of approval."
3,"Bad Video Quality, Episodes in Wrong Order","Like many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the episodes are in the wrong order! Be sure to watch them in the correct order. The video quality is also bad. The transfer to DVD is very noisy, especially in the dark scenes. My 10 year old VHS tapes of the show recorded off air are better quality than some episodes. What a great show to be given such a bad treatment by Universal."
3,Worth a Listen,"Newcomers are far better served by Generation X's debut album or the Perfect Hits compilation. Longtime fans will probably appreciate this disc, however. The '78 show (tracks 1-8) features the original lineup tearing through some of their best songs. The performances are raw, frantic and sloppy. The only real let down is Idol's voice, which sounds particularly weak. The '81 show features a new lineup featuring ex-Clash stick man Terry Chimes. Idol's vocals had actually improved by this point but the band unfortunately sounds as if they are merely going through the motions. None of these live tracks are as good as the studio versions. None the less, this disc is worth investigating if you already own the other stuff, including the superior BBC studio recordings compilation."
5,A lucid account of the history of this problem,This is a well written book about the history of this problem and the people who attempted to solve it. Knowledge of advance math is not necessary but is helpful. Overall a very good read.
5,"A fabulous, must-read book","I can't think of enough reasons to recommend this wonderful book. Pierre Fermat proposed this deceptively simple problem back in the mid-1600s, yet it eluded the greatest mathematical minds of the ages, including Euler, one of the founders of modern mathematics.While not shirking in any way on detail regarding the Theorem, number theory, and the immense difficulties in solving it, Singh manages to make this a very human story. Germain, Galois, Wolfskehl-- these remarkable minds are made flesh-and-blood, and Galois' story in particular is just heart-rending! We are finally brought to the mind-bending proof of Andrew Wiles in the 1990s, and are able to grasp why the Theorem's solution remained so elusive; as simple as it seems at first glance, it requires the ultimate back-door attack and some of the most advanced, specialized mathematics available to tackle it. Kudos to Wiles as always for his achievement, and kudos to Singh for his wonderful book discussing it."
5,best account of proof of Fermat's Last Theorem,"This account of the history of Fermat's Last Theorem, and of the history of those who attempted to prove it, is kind to the general reader but unusually comprehensive. If you're one of those tired of references to the Taniyama-Shimuru conjecture that are accompanied by no explanation of the conjecture, read this book."
4,If you know nothing of Mathematics then you can still read this!,"I'll make this short and sweet.First off the book is an insight into the world of pure mathematics, it uses the fulcrum of the Last Theorem (an apparently very simple rule) to touch upon a number of different issues within both the practice and history of the subject.Second. This book is interesting! It contains almost no technical material (aside from the optional appendices), and pure mathematics is surprisingly fascinating; not being a number theorist i appreciated the many references it has to the practical implications of maths, but there are also some noodle-baking moments concerning ideas that are so very simple, yet totally strange.Third. Fairly quick to read.Fourth. Tells the story of one of the most important breakthroughs of the twentieth century.Hope this was useful"
4,"Very interesting , and mind absorbing.","Anybody who has any interest in math should read this extraordinary book. You will learn so much history about interconecting events, and knowledge developed during these past centuries. I was suprised to learn about all these heroes who invested precious time in the never ending quest to solve problems. Who said math is boring?"
4,"Find yourself sipping tea, while reading this one","For me, mathematics was fun and challenging during the university years. After that, I've practised little, except starting a calculator on my computer.Being a backgrounder for Fermat's last theorem, reading this book fired off a new branch of interest in number theory for me.Fermat's relatively easy problem (at least to formulate), wasn't published with a solution, which either proved that Fermat was a genius, lazy or just saying ""ha-ha, I know something you don't"". The book suggests a combination of them.Weaving together an interesting history of mathematics (with great mathematicians as Euler, Hilbert and Godel) as well as the work of Andrew Wiles who've devoted a great deal of his life to try to solve this theorem, you'll read this book from start to end in no time.If you'd like to get inspired in math, try this one, and then head off into ""Godel, Escher, Bach: an eternal golden braid."""
2,A disappointing effort from Marco,"Having finished the Tyrants and Kings series, I was certainly eager to read Marco's latest effort. Unfortunately, the entire book seems as if it was rushed. The intricate detail in the prose of The Tyrants Series, the worldbuilding that makes the reader almost imagine that he or she is actually in Crote or Nar City, the rich characterizations...just not there in this book. Worse, the flaws of the Tyrants series- banal dialogue, characters who make idiotic and baffling decisions, etc, are actually magnified in this book. The redeeming quality of Eyes is in the plotting. Even at his worst, Marco is an excellent storyteller. But, unless he improves a WRITER, not just storyteller, comparisions to the likes of Hobb and Martin and Kay are extremely premature."
1,Feh!,"Pedantic, pedestrian and painful to read.Here are a few little problems with this book: poorly written characters with no redeeming qualities, a trite and over-used plot, and flat, uninteresting writing.Please, for your own well-being, and the well-being of those around you who don't want to hear you yelling in frustration at trying to get through this drek, find something else to read."
1,New Ideas Please,If you are a big fan of books that make you feal bad this is for you. The main plotline of the book follows the classic pattern of worst case scenerios in every way. The tragedy wouldnt be complete if anyone involved continued to portray the motivations and personalities they started the book with. The kindly king goes insane because his bride leaves him and brother betrays him. The loyal brother betrays the king and steals his bride. The faithfull bride is unfaithfull with her grooms best friend. None of the three main people turn out to be anything like someone you would ever want to know.
4,Just try it!,"I read the book before seeing the DVD and they do compliment each other very nicely. I feel there is enough information given for the average horse owner to go try it! Just don't expect piaffe and half passes in hand on day one. If you designate 10 minutes a day, you will be surprised how far you will get. I teach dressage lessons and I love having my student play with in hand work becuase it helps them learn the movements (like shoulder-in, haunches-in and half pas) before they try it from the saddle. The stepping under of the hind legs is fun too! (I call it ""goat on the mountain"".) I've taught this to a few horses now- it just takes time, so give it a try!"
2,Davy goes grunge!,"The new version of the song ""Girl"" by Davy Jones made me want this cd. The movie was corny but funny and when I heard Davy's song-well, it just made the movie have spice! Get this movie and cd if you and your friends feel like ""monkeying"" around or if you have a sweetheart."
1,Not very good,I got through half of this book before giving up. The writing is not very good and the advice is of questionable value on any level of management.
3,"Excellent for Novices, Less So for Experienced Users ....","Microsoft Access 2000 Comprehensive Concepts and Techniquesby Shelly and Cashman is a good text if you are completely new to computers and/ or want to learn MS Access without instruction. If your skills already include Excel or any level of Access expertise, then the text will likely be too slow for you. The style and layout make it easy to work through on your own but makes the text unsuitable as a reference source for specific MS Access information."
3,One Swatch book is not enough,"I have the 1998 version of this book, I have Swatch Yourself book from 1991 and Bonello's Swatch-Collector 2000 book. I will give a brief overview of them in comparison.Swatch: A guide for.... covers the years 1982 to 1996.Pros: 19 pages of info about the evolution of the creation of the Swatch watch.Pictures are of good quality.Cons: Too few pictures. Some pictures that are in the texts margins are not identified.Swatch Yourself: Covers years 1983 to 1991.Pros: Many Swatch watches pictured, great pictures with index in back.Very large book.Cons: No nuts and bolts info about the history of the swatch or identifingmodel features.Bonello's Swatch-Collector: Covers the years 1983 to 1999.Pros: Has the most listed and pictured swatces of all 3 books.Index included.Nuts and bolts about what the watch codes mean.Cons: picture quality not as good as the other two books.No historical info.Having more than one swatch book is a must"
3,Colorful just like the company,I enjoyed this book. It's pictures were very nice and of course colorful. Had a good introduction to the history of Swatch watches and also informitive for the beginner collector. Nice book overall.
4,An early call at the 87th Precinct,"The 87th Precinct and the guys who staff it must be better known to police procedural mystery readers than any policing establishment in the world. The locale and the guys were presented for the fourth time by author Ed McBain in this short 1957 read. He already opts for the reliable formula: quick changes of scene, colorful dialogue, gruesome murders, suspense, and a chase to effect a last split-second capture at the end. McBain presented several confidence tricks occurring here. Some now seem so obvious and so transparent that one wonders how anyone could fall victim. Nevertheless, for me, McBain's story-telling skill never fails to keep me fascinated."
3,Con Men,"A floater. I found talk about the deceased to be interesting. The notes taken. The speculation, especially about the tattoo heart on the hand in the tender spot between the thumb and forefinger. There was one man's anguish that could almost be felt.While I don't appreciate reading extraneous information about individual characters unless the telling is vital to the story, I did enjoy the telling of how Carella feels about his wife. How he always delights in her. With makeup. Without the veneer of makeup. In contemplation. And no, this part wasn't vital to the story. It was just sweet.A con man hitting on both male and female. At times these parts seemed really dragged out, keeping me from wanting to get back to the book. Other times however, it was remarkable and interesting reading how they ply their ""trade.""While parts dragged, the last part of the book moved along at an increased pace, really livening things up."
3,it's okay,"I admit that after all the reviews I hoped for something special. I found it very similar to others from the same era. Perhaps they were all copying this one, but it is hard to tell. I think time has passed it by."
3,Could not get into the story,I'm a big-time reader but this book simply did not catch my attention. Good Amazon price but I put it away.
5,"A good, but short, mystery","Con Man is a good police mystery containing several details about police procedures. The author adds a different touch by involving the hero's wife in the action. It was little challenging (in a good way) to keep the various cases straight. Contains gruesome descriptions of the victims, but no sex."
2,played out,i bought this cd 2 years ago and have listened to it maybe three or four times. its appallingly obvious that aphrodite is using outdated equipment to produce his music and this cd comes across sounding like all his other stuff. he even bragged in remix magazine about using the same equipment that hes been using for years to patch this stupid cd together. he needs to evolve or just give up producing alltogether. here it is 2 years after the cd has been released and jump-up has not made a come-back. its over people. drum and bass is not for candy-ravers and fairy lovers. just because d&b is moving away from dark and heavy tech-step to more melodic and danceable tunes doesn't mean its prime time for a genre that died 5 years ago.skip this for true colors by high contrast or resonance by reid speed if your looking for innoffensive drum & bass.
5,Semper Fi,"Semper Fi is about all that can be said. This was the life of the grunt. No amplification or heroism that was not there. This is the best book I have ever read discribing the life. Also the excerpt on page 299 and 300 ""These Good Men"" by Micheal Norman is the first and only explanation of all of us that have ever served and our feelings forever to our comrades. I wish Micheal could write another book, I don't think he will. It was all in this one."
3,Adequate,"Crock pots are not like they were in the initial years; due to worries about food safety, I've noticed newer crock pots spike the heat at the end of the cycle on ""low."" My guess is that this is to keep the food sufficiently warm during cooking to avoid bacterial growth. This pot keeps food on ""warm"" very hot. I had a cheese sauce set on warm to keep it after the initial cooking phase, well, it was cooking still on warm and got browned.This is inexpensive and plain (no funky graphics) and the inner liner pulls out for easy cleaning; something some crock pots in this price range don't have. For a crockpot to use to keep mulled cider warm, cocktail meatballs simmering, or soup hot for serve-yourself-whenever, this is not a bad choice. Or it makes a good smaller crock--my regular crock is rather large and not always suitable for one-or-two person meals. On the whole, this pot has its uses and is reasonably priced enough for occasional purposes."
5,Nice simple slow cooker,"I have only used once but it worked well. I chose this model cause I like simple controls. I don't need a lot of buttons. I like the warm button and I like to be able to take out the insert to wash. When I researched slow cookers, this was the only one reviewed which was 4 quart, Didn't need a bigger size."
4,Enjoyable book on a Winters' night...,"The race to the white continent...voyages to the antarctic. Alan Gurney. Did like the read. Gurney was good with the James Clark Ross discovery of the magic of the Ross Sea and Mount Erebus. I had the pleasure to live there. With the Royal Society Range for a backdrop, Minna Bluff to the south. A view of a lifetime. Of the coming storms... Great touch on that. I thought a little boring is the take of the Wilkes Expedition. A British viewpoint anyway...I did think the Gurney spill on Dumont D' Urville's was a plus...A good read...Next up try ""Barrow's Boys""...by Fergus Fleming. 5 stars...easy."
3,Expected more,"For a book on the Children's Literature Banned Booklist in several states I had expected something more...well just something more. It's a cute and short little book for your five-year-old and if you have problems with this story then you really are a sad, bitter soul."
2,Works...if you have low expectations.,"Works if you're going to hook nothing to it but a card reader.Small hard drive (even a tiny 1.8"") - nope...not enough power.USB Wireless LAN....nope....not enough power.The drive, I assumed, so no big deal. Not being able to even power a wireless NIC adapter was surprising, though.Anything that requires virtually any power, and it won't work. It does have a place for an adapter, but expect to pay more for a power adapter than you did for this thing.Still, if ALL you are doing is hooking a card reader or digital camera to it, it works like a charm."
1,illustrations are not meaningfull,"This Book is NO good, as the illustrations on the listed proverbs are not actually related to the proverb meaning. I was expecting to see the drawings actually expressing the Proverb meanning, which is not the case. I do not recommend this book for anyone"
3,Too easy to open,"This is a nice quality case, but I'm going to have to purchase a different case for my phone. This one opens up way too easily and dumps the phone out. I've already dropped it twice and both times the case made my phone look like it was an unwanted vehicle passenger in an old spy movie (you know, an ejection seat?)."
4,Works for me after a slight modification,"I carry my Treo on my belt. All the soft cases I have tried have allowed for the phone functions to be activated and even to have calls made with the Button Lock feature on, so I decided to try this hard case. It is a very nice looking case and the belt clip works great so far. The case is plastic and the hinges do seem somewhat fragile, but only while you have it hanging open. Once closed, the case is very sturdy and secure. This brings me to the problem. The button on top that opens the case was WAY TOO EASY to hit accidentally and open. It happened several times. So I took a small piece of double sided foam tape, folded it in half and poked it up under the edge of the button, making it much harder to press. Problem solved. I have had zero accidental openings and I love the security of the case for my phone! I wouldn't trade it for any other that I have seen so far."
5,Good and waterproof,"After ruining 3 watches in about one month by forgetting to take them off BEFORE they got wet, I decided the only way to keep one for everyday use was to get another waterproof watch. And this one was perfect: glow-in-the- dark feature on the hands, even the second hand; a band that is both durable and attractive, with a safety latch; a light face helps to make out the time in low light, and the date window. Most important, waterproof to keep it running. Features a photographer needs in a darkroom working with wet prints. I'm happy with it, it has lived up to my expectations.However, a word of caution: in my experience waterproof is only until you open the back to replace the battery. My former waterproof watch sprung a leak then."
2,Thin pot and not good non-stick coating,"I thought with Analon name the pot would be in decent quality. However, it turned out not so good quality. The pot is thin, so it gets hot and burned very quickly. Plus, the non-stick coating is not very effective. I got this pot at very good price ($14), so that could be ""you get what you pay for"".One positive point: good size pot and lid looks very nice."
5,Double Pleasure,"Straight and simple:If you've seen them in concert, you'll want this album.If you've not seen them in concert, and have a passing interest in this band, buy the album and you should then want to them in concert."
4,Heartwarming Childrens Story,"This is a charming tale about unconditional love for a child. ""Big Bear"" and ""little Bear"" spend a typical day together where the little bear is grumpy and fractious (a day any mother of a toddler will recognise)but in the ""Big Bear"" never loses patience. All the stories in this series are huge favouries with me and my toddler as they are always a delight to read out loud with adorable illustrations."
1,Don't Buy This,"Bought and returned two of these Type S Digital Compasses...neither would calibrate. Even an MA in EE could not get them to calibrate. Not worth your money, time or frustration!"
2,Worked great... just not in my car,"This compass worked perfectly... when I held it in my hand. When I tried to mount it to my dashboard, stray magnetic fields from who-knows-what confused it to the point that it couldn't work reliably. I ended up having to return this.If your car has weak enough magnetic fields, this compass will work great for you! It's easy to read. However, don't be surprised if you can't get a reliable reading."
3,Type S Digital Compass,"Compass takes forever to initialize after pressing the reset button. Directions say press reset button and drive car in a small circle until it stops blinking. Well after driving in a circle for about five minutes I just gave up. Compass blinked for two days while driving and never did show the correct direction. Finally it stopped blinking and worked fine for several days. When it froze (ie display did not change direction while driving) I tried to reset it again pursuant to the directions and the same thing happend. I finally removed the compass from the car and walked it in a circle in my yard in order to get it to reset. My wife who wanted the compass gives it 1 star. I give it at least three because once calibrated, it seems to work OK."
5,Great compass,This digital compass works great. Once installed in the car I was able to tilt it easily so that it was readable. The light is very useful as well.
1,BUYERS BEWARE TOTAL JUNK,"Purchased this after reading reviews and doing research on most compasses. Buyers take my advice and dont buy this because you will be just throwing it away just as I did. It does not work, its NEVER accurate and this company should be ashamed of itself for selling such JUNK. Its cost was not worth sending it back and paying the shipping. I think Amazon should not sell products like this and perhaps read up on such things before selling this item. I am a totally unhappy buyer and want everyone to know, Dont buy this !!!! JUNKO"
5,worked perfectly on our trip,"We traded our Pathfinder with the built in compass for a Trailblazer that didn't have one, and I was really missing having it. I checked into have a built in one installed and it was just too many $$ for an old retired guy. I bought this compass because of other reviews I read and have found it to work just fine 99% of the time. Just once it told me we were going SE when I knew we were going W. Every other time we used it it was perfect, so who knows why. All in all, quite pleased for the cost and ease of use."
1,Don't bother...,"This unit was purported to work in most any vehicle, but was completely flummoxed by my Hyundai Santa Fe. I then took it and attempted setup in my Dodge Grand Caravan - same results. Returned the product for a refund. This auto compass thing appears to be a non-starter, because I had also tried 2 other after-market comapasses from places like target, and still got only north, regardless of direction I was facing. I finally bit the bullet and bought a Garmin 1300 (a relatively inexpensive GPS), and now my directionals are satellite-perfect."
4,Good set for spare bed,"Color a little ""dingier"" than pictured. For our spare room the set is fine, good price. Soft, nice weight."
1,Waiting 3 months for delivery!,"I ordered the item in June and now it's September! When I check the status, it still lists the estimated delivery date in August! Where's my stuff?? I still want this item!"
2,Limited shelf life,Date on bottom of can shows an expiration of June 2007. I would expect a longer shelf life.Also the label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat. This generally equates to bone fragments. I'm not confident with this product.
1,Disappointed,"I have been designing custom cakes for 12 years, and was excited about this book based on the cover shot. However, when it arrived I was sadly disappointed that the cover was not indicative of what was inside the book. I expected to find professional and ""a finsihed, polished look"" to the cakes (as most of us would expect to see in books!), but found many of the cakes to be lop-sided, TIN FOIL showing on the cakes (unfinished), and very unsmooth & 'pitted' icing - not at all what I would expect from a commercially published book! There were many idea's in there (I think around 55 cakes or so?), but the quality of workmanship was so poor that I'm sorry to say that I wouldn't recommend this book."
5,One of our favorites!,"This was one of the best toys that Santa brought - my then 9 month old loved it, and at 1 yrs old, she still does! This thing is just great, it is colorful & interactive - she takes the balls out & tosses them back in, and loves to crawl inside and kick the balls around - and I love to toss in other random toys, he makes a great way to carry toys to different areas of the house (or to take with us when we go visiting) We all love it!!! (even our 4 yr old likes playing with it!) ;-)"
2,"Eh, overpriced and uninteresting","My son received this for Christmas last year when he was 1 and almost a year later, he still has no interest in it. Bought a regular ball pit, way cheaper and that's the one he loves. This was a waste of money. Wouldn't recommend it. Cute but boring."
3,Just one problem,"We bought this for our one- year old grandson, and he loves it. The vacuum is light and an appropriate size, but there is one small problem: there should be an additional wheel at the front of the toy-- it drags when placed in the pushing position! This can be a bit frustrating for a child. Our solution is to have him tilt the vac onto the rear wheels which he does easily. Too bad the company did not spend a little more money to do this right."
3,"Its o,k","This was my second choice for a vaccum, due to the first one being on backorder for 2 months then they just cancelld my order. I bought this for my granddaughter and nephew. She loves the lift out dustbuster part of it. She is still a little young for this product but I got it for her because she loves it when I vacuum. I bought it off of the reviews its a good product."
3,"Dance, Shiva, Dance","The music of India is the starting place for this German group's exploration of musical hybridization. Accessible, dancy, and smooth."
1,screwed up my computer,I stopped using this program cause it kept screwing up my windows XP computer (according to microsoft). It would cause Internet Explorer to shut down continually - over and over. I didn't have any better luck with firefox.I guess that is how they keep your kids off dangerous sites - by making browsers shut down continually!
3,contains magnesium stearate,"It is a good value I buy them for my old aging dog and she gets a half with dinner. Sometimes I take one too, until I realized what magnesium stearate was doing to me. (Severe gastric upset). My gastro says magnesium does that to a lot of people. So until they take the mag stearate out I no longer can take these, oh well some regular aspirin is without that stuff!"
3,Not as Good as III,"I bought this one as a gift for my father, he loves Ceasars III. He said this one is not as good as 3, and it takes much longer to load. So there are times in the game that it freezes."
1,No Subject,"I wouldt recommend any sierra games because they are basically the same, you always have to fight to keep you city going and the graphics are lame."
1,"Crashes, doesn't load up etc etc","I should have read the majority of the reviews before I tried to install this piece of crap. Won't load cab3 files. Won't load, can't play it, no good , piece of crap.If you need to spend as much time looking for and applying fixes and work arounds to make software run then that's just a sign of extremely sloppy production practices. Do they test these before releasing them, what's the story?A very frustrating waste of time and energy.I will not be looking for any Siera products in the near future you can count on that."
1,Disappointed Caesar 3 addict,"I have read all the other reviews of people having difficulty to run the game, but bought it anyway. I am such a Caesar 3 addict, that I had to have this, even if it is buggy.So I got it and started playing, and it looked great. Then it started crashing. I got the patch, which refused to install, giving me a message I'm running the wrong version of the game. Got the other patch, but it is doing the same.Last night, after less than a week since I got Caesar 4, I uninstalled it, very very disappointed indeed.Don't do it to yourself."
2,Rome falls to the 3D barbarians,"Having had hours of fun playing the previous incarnations of Caesar and also Pharaoh and Zeus, I was really anticipating this. Unfortunately, as with Age of Empires III it's a case of poorer gameplay for the sake of not very impressive 3D graphics - and my PC is relatively high spec. Sad to say this is one Caesar too far and I'll stick to the (in my opinion) better graphics and gameplay of the previous version."
3,Exciting graphics don't make for more engaging play,"Although I've been a fan of Caesar III for over 3 years, I have not found Caesar IV to be as engaging. City-building is spectacular in the new graphic environment; however, inadequate messaging and information about how to improve prosperity is as frustrating as in version III. The user interface is not particularly intuitive, and maneuvering troops does not work as easily as in the predecessors to Caesar IV. If a new version is on the horizon, perhaps improvement to ease of use could make meeting the challenges of the Emperor more fun rather than more frustrating."
1,Gimmick! Aweful! Fail!,"Do not waste your time and money on these. They are completely BOGUS! I honestly believe plain ice from the freezer stays cold long. And they don't stay warm after microwaving either.I was really excited when I found these, because I had broken both bones in my arm, and have to apply ice to control the pain. I thought these were going to be just what I needed.I followed the instructions exactly. THEY ARE JUNK.And, by the way, I bought three sheets of them, so it wasn't just one bad factory screw up! The whole product is a SCREW UP, and HOGWASH!And, that's how I feel about it. You can probably recognize my disappointment and anger for being ripped off - not by Amazon, but by the company that came up with this dishonest scheme, and for the seller misrepresenting them!"
2,Ice Packs,I like the versatility of the sheets as you can customize the size as needed but they leak as they thaw and get slimy.
4,"Good, but","Item works as stated. I don't like that the individual squares activate at different rates. So, while one square is completely full of water, a few were not even half way absorbed with water. I had some squares overactivated and others that were barely getting any water into them. So, I let the thing soak for awhile and eventually all the squares absorbed water, however, some squares still were not fully absorbed and I had to squeeze out some water from the overactivated squares. Put ice sheet in freezer on coldest setting and it froze fairly quickly and was able to use it within about an hour. I would recommend this product."
4,Good product...,"Good product that allowed my kid to walk the dog rather than the dog walk the kid (Kid = 50 pounds, dog = 45 pounds!) Unfortunately my puppy figured out how to chew through it in no time at all so we're already in need a replacement. If only someone would invent a puppy-proof material..."
5,Stops leash pulling!,I have a little 19lb dog that loves to pull on the leash. When he's wearing this harness he does not pull or yank on the leash. He isn't thrilled when I put it on him and tends to try to bite the extra loop in the front. But it works really well to prevent pulling.
3,"Seemed to work, but chafed my dogs armpits","This harness seemed to work as it claimed to, but my dog has very little hair on his chest/belly and so it chafed his armpits really badly (I even tried different sizes and they all chafed, so sizing wasn't the issue). If your dog has more fur or doesn't have sensitive skin, this may work well for you."
4,"Harness is great, needed some ""stitched"" adjustments","We bought a medium for our wheaten terrier, who has a rather narrow chest. When she pulls to go after a squirrel, it works wonderfully - pulling her back toward us without yanking either her neck or our shoulders. However, after a few times of going after squirrels the strap across the chest (from where the loop hangs) gets loose; eventually, that strap is hanging down closer to the tops of her legs than across her chest. Tonight I took a heavy needle and some carpet thread and after setting the chest strap to its narrowest position stitched it in place so that it wouldn't slip. Works perfectly now! I recommend this harness - not perfect, but really really good."
3,it's a bit slippery,"perhaps I haven't got the setting just right but when my dog tries to get in front of me while walking with this harness, it slips to the side and he can get his leg out of it. When this happens, the harness is ineffective. I took it to our dog training class, which is the place that recommended it, so they could help me with the adjustment. They admitted it's difficult to work. However, when my dog is not anxious to get ahead of me, the effect of this harness works which is to say, he would rather walk next to me in a calm manner."
2,Adjusments don't stay adusted.,"After making all the adjustments to the harness, we set out on a walk. For a few days it worked really well. However, the adjustments on the front of the harness will not stay adjusted. It becomes loose and ineffective. The leash also rubs on the dog's leg. After about a week, I noticed hair loss on the outside of the dog's leg. Fortunately, that's all that occurred. If I'd used it any longer, there would be sores on her leg, too.I hate that it didn't work for my dog. Now, we're back with the Martingale collar and leash. She was doing pretty well with it most of the time. However, now it seems we are starting all over again with the training after using the harness."
2,Didn't work for me,The constriction on my dog caused him to sit. He didn't pull very hard but it was enough to make him not want to go forward. He later slipped out of it and chewed through one of the straps rendering it completely useless. The product is described as for Large dogs so I would think they'd use a material not so easily chewed through not merely making it large enough to fit around the pet. I will not be replacing it.
3,Dog harness,"I found it easy to put on, the dog does not fight the installation, anti extremely easy to take off. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BHT5OY/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,"Awkward to put on, and dog can wiggle out easily","This harness fits differently than other harnesses. The leash ring is in the front (on the dog's chest), not on his back. The way you have to put it on the dog is a little awkward for me, and I found it difficult to get on my dog very quickly (especially when he is excited). I might have gotten used to this later, but my dog could wiggle out of it in seconds when sitting. For example, when I picked my dog up from the vet, I put the harness on him and put him in the car. By the time that I had gotten to the driver's side of the car and opened my door, he had wiggled out of the harness."
1,Premier harness,Hard to use do not like how it fits around my dogs chest seem very uncomfortable for her to walk. Good quality well made product
3,"Premier Easy Walk Harness, Medium, Black/Silver",I have a 90lb German Sheppard that pulls like crazy. I bought this harness because my dog hated the gentile leader on her face. It works great to stop the pulling. Every time she tries to pull it angles her body to were she stops. Taking it on and off is really easy because of the clips. I would give this 5 stars but the durability is questionable. The 1st one I bought she ended up chewing off when we left her alone for a couple hours. I thought maybe since she had time to chew on it that it was my fault to leave it on her. So I bought another one since it worked so well. Unfortunately I had it on her for literally 5 minutes and while I was in my garage she had chewed it off again. So if you have a dog that chews this is not the product for you.
4,really is easy to walk!,"ok, so i actually bought this for my brother's dog (size small, schnoodle mix, about 15 lbs) because she is a little pain to walk. she pulls like crazy, and is a little beast on the leash. this isnt super great on her because she seems like she'd walk on 2 paws if she could. haha (but i must admit it definitely helps anyway). meanwhile,i really got the idea and bought it for my cocker spaniel who also is a puller on a leash. this definitely has helped with her, and has been my go-to harness!"
2,didn't work for us,"Bought this for my 70-pound Irish Wolfhound mix. Fortunately, I tried the collar around the house first. Literally ten seconds after putting it on him, my dog had managed to get it in his mouth and he chewed it in three places. It didn't stand up to being in his mouth for this very short period of time. Tried walking him around anyway just to try it out. Didn't keep him from pulling at all. The whole collar just shifted to one side. Now I don't know if I can get a refund due to the chew marks."
2,"serves it's purpose, but painful for the pup","I was introduced to this product by our dog trainer - she highly recommended it for our dog's pulling problem. While it DOES work at redirecting the dog's weight when he pulls, it also rubs his underarm area severely. We've tried to refit it and we purchased the right size, but to no avail. Almost all of his underarm hair is rubbed off and our dog cannot sit on command while wearing this product without it digging into his underarms even more. He HATES this product (goes running when he sees it) and we feel like we're hurting him just by using it. I understand that it's a good training device, and for that we are grateful, but it causes so much discomfort and pain that we rarely use it anymore."
3,Not for all breeds?,"We have a 4-year-old American Bulldog and she is very strong, determined and ""alpha."" I really don't think this harness is designed for ""determined"" strong breeds like ABDs. It helps a ""little"", but I think it's meant for more docile/gentle breeds. Just my 2-cents."
2,It didn't really work...,"The harness didn't really stop my dog from pulling. I have a very energetic 45 lb mixed breed that isn't well socialized or leash trained. I was hoping this would help with the latter. It did deter her from pulling, but not without constant pressure and redirection from me. And it did very little to discourage her when she saw a squirrel or a mouse that looked worth chasing. I didn't lose control of her, but my arm was definitely sore when we got home. We went for a mile walk for the test run, and I checked her immediately for signs of irritation that many other users have reported. She had a big red spot under her leg, no broken skin or lost fur, but I will not put her through that again."
1,Not worth it,"Bought this for my 100 pound 1 year old lab. It rubbed under his front paw ""armpit"" so bad it left a bad mark. I wouldn't advise buying a harness like this. It needs some kind of padding for the dog."
2,Not for short legs,"Yep, totally agree with the other reviews about dogs with short legs, the second my corgi saw a squirrel, she was out of it. It's too bad, because in the about 30 seconds before she figured out how to get out of it, it really did work."
5,An answer for a hard to walk dogs,This is the third time I purchased this item because my dog had chewed it through when I forgot to take it off of him at home. My 20 lb cocker never learned to walk next to or behind me and pulls me hard whenever he sees anything interesting on the side of the road. This harness minimizes the effort I need to make to control him and keep him by my side.
1,Too small,"It was a great concept but the medium I ordered was way too tight, I sent it back for a refund, I'll try something else"
2,Disappointed,"The concept of this harness is quite brilliant. It really does decrease the amount of pulling but the harness doesn't sit straight. If the dog pulls at all the harness shifts, it gets under the dogs front legs and begins to chaffe (spelling?) him. I've tried adjusting it quite often but it never seems to work. I gave it an honest weeks trial before I threw it with the other piece of crap harnesses I've tried. The best ones are the simple attach in the back ones in my opinion."
1,Save your money!!!!,"Reflective Easy Walk Dog Harness, Petite/Small, RedVery disappointed, a waste of money. I purchased a regular harness instead and rotated it untilthe D ring is on my dog's chest was just as effective and cheaper."
3,harness,I have a 55 lb pitbull mix puppy. The harness is good but you need to make sure you read the directions about how to put it on. I find that a lot of people who have walked him for me put it on incorrectly. It's a good training tool and it's good for pitbulls. Using a choke-chain to train pitts is a bad idea because they have a high pain tolerance and will hurt themselves. The only issue I have is that when you're training a puppy that pulls or if you go on very long walks the harness tends to rub raw the inside of the dogs armpits. I would have opted for a padded one had I known. But the harness is good and sturdy and definitely a trusted brand.
3,works ok,"It helps keep my dog from choking herself. It nice because when the dog jumps too much and you give it a little yank mid air the do gets flipped around which startles them and hopefully discourages bad behavior. Unfortunately, the chest strap is always too loose. It barely takes any kind of tugging from me or the dog to loosen it. I suggest premier replaces the adjusters with non slip self tightening ones because these just don't do the job and my dog is only 40 lbs."
3,Hard to figure out,"This is okay- It's kind of hard to figure out, and it has the worst instuctions I've ever read, I wouldn't buy one again."
4,Definitely made dog walks easier,"This harness helped in stopping our dog from pulling during walks. It does take a bit of adjustment to get it to the right fit - but once we did, the dog could not pull as hard as he did previously. It can be difficult to snap on and off - so we mostly leave the collar on him all day. I would recommend this collar if your dog has a habit of pulling and jumping when you take them for a walk"
4,great product,"I purchased this for my doberman. He was a rescue, never walked on a leash before, and is very trail driven. Go for walks, and he doesn't want to stop. This harness has helped a great deal control his pulling."
2,Not for my dog,"I had read a similar warning in the reviews before purchasing, but this harness did not fit my dog well at all. She's a little cockapoo so she's low to the ground, and I could never adjust the harness quite right to fit her body shape (I tried both medium and small harnesses). The side straps were constantly digginer into her armpits, and I was worries she would get irritation so I decided to return the product.I hate to give a bad review as I'm sure the product works great for bigger dogs, but for those of use with petite furry friends I'd look elsewhere for a harness that fits better."
1,Not for dogs low to the ground!!!!,"I had to return 2 of these harnesses (and got dinged a 20% restocking fee from this seller - on top of the cost of shipping both ways). This harness does not work with all dogs. Both my dogs fit the ""girth measurement"" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of ""short"" dogs that this would not be a good choice.If you want to try this out on your dog, buy it from a dealer who will refund ALL the purchase price without a 20% restocking fee. It's too risky otherwise."
2,"Worked @ First, Doesn't Work Anymore","My 8-month old Retriever is a champion puller. I tried this harness after another dog owner told me she'd used it on her Lab and claimed that ""it was like walking a totally new dog"".It seemed to work for the first week or so (it wasn't ""walking a totally new dog"" though, he still tried pulling and was being a pain). After that, he must have figured out some way of getting around it, because he started pulling again. I checked to see if it had loosened, and it hadn't.When walking on a loose lead, this harness causes the leash to jump up and down violently, which gets very annoying for the walker.Lastly, one has basically zero control over the dog when using this harness. My dog managed to knock me over by cutting in front of me. If I had been using a collar, I could have prevented it.So, basically, I can't say I really recommend it. I'm not very satisfied with it and considering returning it."
3,Great price but there are better versions,"The concept of this lead is great and it definitely reduces pulling. However, there are other versions out there that clip to the dog's collar that are better, and there's also a mesh harness that attaches to the leash on the back of the dog (vs. the front with this one) that works as well and is easier to use/handle. I'll keep this one as a backup."
3,"Worked and yet, didn't work.","I ordered the Premier Easy Walk Dog Harness in Small/Medium for my Jack Russell Terrier because she has a very deep chest, 20 inches. I sat down with her and followed the instructions as best I could until all the straps were snug but not too snug and everything looked in place. The harness did stop the hard pulling, but the clip on her leash did bounce on and off her chest, which looked like it could get uncomfortable on a long walk. Also, since my dog likes to sniff the ground ALOT, I noticed that if I need to pull HER, nothing really stops the shoulder strap from sliding way forward and a few times (although I didn't see how it happened) slip in front of her shoulder."
2,straps don't hold up,"I bought two of the easy walk harnesses. After three weeks of use for daily walks the strap on one of the harnesses has completely worn to a thread. It is the strap that attaches to the leash. I only leave these on the dog for walking so there was no chewing, etc. I will be contacting the company. The harness is much better for walking than the traditional lead but getting it on takes two people with my active labs."
4,Miracle Harness!!,"Wow. I am amazed at how much difference this harness makes. My 40 lb German Shorthaired Pointer was practically dragging me down the road with a collar and leash. She gets distracted by EVERYTHING. Not only that, but to get her attention, I had to pull pretty hard on the leash (which didn't seem good for her neck). We took our first walk with the EasyWalk Harness lastnight. She still tries to lead me, but I am in total control. She's not able to pull me around like before. As soon I pull back on the leash she slows down and comes back to me. Not only does she stop bolting; depending on which side pulling towards, the harness will automatically correct her to walk straight. For fifteen bucks, this is the best investment if your dog's walking YOU. Plus it was at my doorstep less than 2 days after I ordered with Amazon Prime w/free shipping."
3,Wasn't what I had hoped for.,"For my Lab mix anyway, this didn't do what I had hoped. She tended to fuss and fight with her gentle leader and never really did ""get used to it."" So I spent the money on an easy walker. First of all, she escaped. Horrifying enough on it's on, but she is Houdini in disguise I think. Our trainer suggested hooking it to her collar as well. Okay, fine. Did that.It made no difference in her behavior what so ever. I was pretty bummed out.NOW, with that said, this particular harness works well for our Coonhound. She is a puller (forward, where as my Lab tends to pull up, down, left, right, where ever) and this stops some of that. It doesn't work magic with her like in the commercials. I firmly believe most dogs need consistent work and training to get to that point. If you're one of the lucky few that experienced magic results with this harness then that's wonderful!! I just wasn't one of them."
1,Hard to believe it made it to market,"I could earn a PhD in Poor Harness design, and I don't think I could come up with anything worse than the Easy Walk Harness. Do you hold your dog's leash in front of and below him? If so, this might well be the harness for you! But if you walk behind your dog, and you're at all taller than your dog, then this harness is worthless. Why, why, WHY would you attach the leash in front? Also, the lack of any kind of a cross-strap allows my dog to wiggle out of the harness with extraordinary ease. Plus, all the loops and buckles and what-not make it heavy, uncomfortable and ugly.My dog hates this harness.I hate this harness.Happily for us both, there are much better - and much less expensive - harnesses on the market."
5,Walks Are Enjoyable Now!,"I have a 10 lbs small dog. He was a puller from the day I met him. Treating and positive training was going about 50 / 50. A friend suggested this in a small / petite and our walks were a million times better in the first go!On day 2 of walking, I was remarking what a great walk we were having and how he wasn't pulling and that this halter was amazing. I looked down and noticed that I have actually clipped my leash to his collar, not the halter.In ONE walk my dog because a non pulling, obedient walker, allowing me to take the lead. I am a convert and will tell everyone about this."
4,specific and heart-felt,I appreciate how DeMoss shares her heart and specific suggestions for developing a personal daily devotional life with God. I also appreciate her use of other women's experiences and practices to broaden its application for women from many stages of life.
1,barber injector platinum,not a good product. company need to discontinue product. blades dull and cuts skin while shaving.need refund for product. not worth anything.
2,Pretty Photos and Very Little Else,"This book has beautiful photos - but even some of those are mislabelled, claiming to show the wrong place!Other than that, it covers the major tourist attractions of the country in broad, general terms.Even this poor coverage is full of errors and spelling mistakes.Practical information is ranging from the completely absent to the very limited.It may be OK to have this book as a souvenir - certainly not as a guidebook!"
4,Very Good Intro to Basic Steps,"I just watched this video. It presented a very good presentation of basic dance steps. The instructor's oral delivery was clear and easy to understand, and the demonstrations of the moves were broken down into easy-to-follow steps.After the step-by-step demonstrations, the video presents dancers on the ballroom floor, dancing to the sounds of a big-band, performing the same dances just taught.This video is helpful and engaging. Very good value."
2,Three days of fun and now in storage...,"I was very excited about these based on the reviews, but forget that and realize that they are simply flat pieces of wood all cut to the same dimensions. They are very thin, so even though the children had fun for a day or two stacking them, they do not resemble any actual building materials I have ever seen. This makes it difficult to do anything useful with them, and not particularly educational unless your child is going to build Dr. Seuss houses when they grow up. If shaped like bricks, they'd be far more enjoyable and practical.Our creative and smart 7-yo and 3-yo have not touched them in months after three days of stacking them and trying hard to balance them on their thin sides. So in that sense they are educational because my children learned what shapes aren't great for building with."
2,"Little Budda, Little thought","It seems to me that this movie was rushed through production. I feel that this movie could have gone deeper into the truth of Buddism and not lingered on the top of it. I don't understand how the parents of the little boy would just leave him with perfect strangers or let him run off by himself in Bhutan. There seemed to be no point with the fact that the fathers freind died, except that it showed connection between Siddhartha and the boy. In the end of the movie, I didn't understand how the kids ended up watching Siddhartha be temtped under the Bo tree and reach enlightenment. While many of the things shown about Buddism were true, they forgot some main ideas such as the four noble truths and the eight fold path.In all, I feel this movie could have been taken more time on in the making and resulted in a pathetic movie that stretches the reality of our lives"
1,"Mysterious and OTHER, but not too","Bertolucci seems to try tempering his obvious opinion of the film's subject matter as Mysterious(!) and Other (oh my!) by casting a very poor Keanu Reeves as Siddhartha Guatama (maybe if we paint a white guy, people will relate better?).And not a memorable character in the film."
1,Keanu Reeves: Worst Actor EVER,"This movie was terrible. The story was great and I love the culture but the movie itself was horrible. The writing was cliché. Keanu Reeves was terrible, (well when ISN'T he?) The only good part of the movie was the sets and the child actors. The child who played Jesse was alright, the child that played Raj was the best, and the little girl was alright. I would not EVER recommend this movie to anyone. If you're looking for a cliché, horribly acted, Keanu Reeves movie, then this one's for you. If not, RUN from it at the movie store."
1,Little Buddha,I adored this movie but the copy of the DVD that I bought from moviemars had AWFUL resolution and veiwability. The first 10 minutes of the movie are almost completely black and at several other points suring the movie also. The audio is good throughout but is VERY HARD TO WATCH. I bought the least expensive DVD and am now going to buy a higher proced copy and see if I can get one that is WATCHABLE. No stars for you Moviemars!
1,Poorly-Made Toy,"I bought this castle for my daughters, 4 and 2, for Christmas and was really disappointed. I feel like I wasted my money. It comes apart every time you open and close it. In addition, the lock that is supposed to keep it shut doesn't work. The spiral staircase is a little weird in that it doesn't lock in place like it's supposed to, so it's always shifting around. My girls liked it at first because it does light up and make noise, but now they've lost interest -- it's just not really very nice. Spend the extra money and get one that's made well."
4,Photo is different then the actual item received . . . . . . . . .,"The headphone sound great and are comfortable, however the photo description of this item shows a coil cord and it is actually a short straight cord. The short cord is useless if your using these for drumming as I am. I had to use an ""extension"" cord and that added expense and weight."
3,Just OK,"Blocks the sound quite well, so good for A drum, at the expsense of tightness and mediocre audio quality. But I'd look for something else, something lighter and more comfortable, if you have E drum, like I do. Three stars for build quality, as the adjustment system is little flimsy."
3,"good sound, almost too small for my head","these are pretty good headphones and are a good buy for the price, but I've got a bigger than average skull, i guess. in their fully extended position, they barely cover my ears completely. it's not quite as comfortable as it could be for that reason. the cord could be longer as well, but isn't really a problem in my studio. otherwise, they sound good, and the isolation is really nice."
2,"good isolation, poor audio quality","i bought a pair of these headphones, and im not impressed. they're good if you're planning on using them as hearing protection for when you're playing acoustic drums, but the sound quality is pretty bad if you're planning on listening to music through them or using them with an electronic drum kit. I also have a pair of beats by dre and they're amazing, not even in the same category as these vic firth headphones. but then again there is a big price difference between the two....just goes to show that you can't get a good pair of headphones at a cheap price. you get what you pay for."
2,When is it going to get interesting?,"How many times can you crash a spaceship on a planet and walk away from the crash, despite not being strapped in? How many deadly robots can you kill while facing them down a hallway without getting more than scratched?This book had an intriguing premise and I kept going with the hope that it might get interesting. It did not. The main character is supposed to be an excellent soldier, but he blunders straight ahead without tactics. I like a lot of military science fiction, but the military angle is disappointing. The potential political and personal dramas are also not played out. The character development is superficial and cliched."
2,Not for men,"I decided to give this product a try because it was hypo-allergic. I still don't know how to figure out if it even works. It's a crystal stick that you wet and apply under your arm. It's suppose to keep you dry, but that didn't happen for me. It may work for others, but I ended up switching back to my normal brand. If you are looking for an organic deodorant,you may want to look into other options."
4,it works if u work it,"it's a little inconvenient feeling & we're so used to slathering something on, but if u can get over that - it works!!!"
3,This is Aluminium people.,"I've never used this product but what made me gave it a second look is because of the name of the brand. I was from Thailand and this stone is quite popular as a deodorant and super cheap in Thailand. This is a form of Aluminium crystral (KAl(SO4)2.12H2O), so anyone who love this product because it's all natural... DUHH. Actually it is chemical and is synthesized, not dig from the ground or anything. Also, most Thai people know that using this Aluminium crystral for a long period will cause your underarms to be darker in color."
4,"Good stuff, but still searching for the perfect solution for me","This stuff is good, but as a heavy sweater, it just doesn't do the trick on hot days or on days i will be dealing with stressful/uncomfortable situations. Around the house or in winter time it is fine and definitely helps with that sort of odor. But if i am going on a date, have an interview or it's 95 degrees outside, i just don't trust that this will do the trick. I really hate using anti-perspirants because of the aluminum and other chemicals, but i'm still searching from something can combat the sweating a little more and not just the odor."
2,Does Not Work,"I was excited to try this product; its reviews were terrific. I perspire very minimally without any antiperspirant, and not at all with typical drugstore antiperspirant. I tried thsi salt deoderant product for six days. Each day the product failed, I perspired, and so each day I applied more and more layers of the product. The additional layering made no difference. I wish I could recommend the product, but I cannot."
3,An american reading an english book,"It is a very helpful book.But sadly, the pound and the dollar arent the same,and the price specifications are almost no use to me.I don't know if any thing else is different,so you will have to figure that out yourself."
3,Step by Step,"This is an excellent primer on monitoring and evaluation for small business development projects. The techniques it promotes are adaptable to a variety of businesses, from rural agriculture to larger manufacturing operations. They present M&E methods for working with non-traditional business people, including illiterates, and those with limited financial/accounting knoweledge. The book's strength in it's breadth might also be considered a weakness, once you know what type of business you're focusing on, you'll have to do some more digging to develop the specific evaluative measures pertinent to your project goals, be they social, environmental, etc."
4,Good product that is hard to find in stores,I borrowed a Casio Label Machine from someone who had it in storage because they could not find the cartridges in stores. After searching the Amazon store I found and bought it. This product really worked well for me. I used it to label wedding favors instead of doing expensive engraving.
5,DDR Ultramix 2,"The game was brand new (if it wasn't, it sure looked like it was). It works perfect and came in the mail like two days after I ordered it."
1,Don't even bother,My nine month old can get this off in 3 seconds flat. She thinks this is the best game ever. The clips are too weak to hold anything. I am taking this back today.
4,Pretty Convenient,"We bought this Klippis after seeing our niece with it and ended up taking it on vacation instead of a bunch of bibs. Overall it worked very well, but if I had to make one comment I'd say I wish the clips opened wider to accommodate easier attachment to cloth napkins. But otherwise, if you're diligent not to lose it (or allow your child to play with it and then lose it) it's a simple easy to use invention that should have been made a long time ago. I'd recommend it to anyone especially for use on trips."
3,Teacher candidates and teacher educators need to read this book!,"Hope many teacher candidates and teacher educators read this book. Gatto criticizes public schooling and has made some valid points. Maybe we -- I am a teacher educator, too -- need to think hard how we want to respond to these criticisms."
5,Drummer Boy,"I remember watching this show every year with my mom. It is a great story to share with my kids, and it takes me back to memories I shared with my mom, who is no longer with us."
2,nostalgia ain't what it used to be,"Loved the Christmas TV special ""The Little Drummer Boy"" as a child, so I thought I'd order it. Having watched it for the first time in about 35 years, it no longer measures up (with the exception of the nativity scene) to such greats as Mr. Magoo's ""A Christmas Carol"" or ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". Generally a big bore, although the Vienna Choir Boys still inspire."
5,memories...,This is the gorgeous TV movie I remember watching as a child every year at Christmas time - and every year I laughed at the animation and cried at the poignancy of the story. A must for every Christmas tragic!
5,Great little tool,"We were always too lazy to go out in the backyard to switch on/off the pump for our pool - that is the perfect solution, it worked out of the box as expected (not too much functionality anyhow that you can expect from an on/off switch...). The only ""problem"" we had was that we ordered two of these and you can not switch the remote control. So, if you intend to buy more than one and you want to independently control them, make sure that your vendor will send you different channels (the channel no. is printed on the package)."
1,Useless through walls or other barriers,"I wanted a remotely-controlled power outlet for a computer lab, which is behind a wall from my office desk.Behold... its quoted 100 foot reach is line-of-sight only!I couldn't get it to turn on/off even from 3 feet distance if there was a wall in the way. Or, for that matter, even from on the other side of a computer!If you plan on using this item, you'll have to settle for using it in the same room (or, if outside, then the same side of the house) that the outlet is located, and only if you can see the outlet itself from where you're standing."
4,Just missing confirmation,"This product is almost perfect. I use it to turn on and off a water pump that pulls hot water into our home system, so we do not need to wait minutes for the shower to get hot water every morning. This allows us to make a more responsible use of water.Product is in the garage close to water heater and I have remote by my bed in the second floor. I have used it for 2 months now and just once it did not turn on. It would be great to have confirmation in the remote that the product is on or off. This is the only reason to rate it 4."
3,Outdoor RC Power Outlet,SVAT WRC101 Wireless Outdoor Remote Control Power OutletWorks fine except that the distance from which it will work seems to vary with the weather -- sometimes it works from our back door just over 110 feet away but other times I have to walk nearly halfway out to get it to function.
1,Don't ignore the 1-star reviews,"When I got this there was only 1 bad review so I went ahead. This unit stopped working on me as well. I live where it doesn't get terribly cold but it gets below 35 overnight quite a bit. It worked for 5 days and then stopped. I am not having any luck warming this up to a working state again as some other reviewers did. All things being equal, look elsewhere for a product like this.UPDATE: I got a replacement from the manufacturer and the same issue. Day 1 usage worked great. Got below 30 at night and wouldn't work. This should not be listed as outdoor."
2,Trips device reset,"I got it to wirelessly control an industrial drum fan. It works to turn the fan off, but because it completely cuts power to the fan (I presume this is the reason), it trips the fan's AC plug reset button (ground fault circuit interrupter?). Therefore to turn the fan back on you must first turn on the SVAT device, then press the fan's reset button. The reset button is not tripped when the fan is plugged directly into the AC outlet.This device may work for some applications, but beware of this limitation. Many outdoor devices have built-in interrupters.I'm currently looking for a competing device that won't trip the reset button."
4,How to Get Your Company To Use TOC,"This book has recieved mixed review, likely because it isn't so much an explaination of TOC or how to do TOC, as it is how to get your company to use TOC. The book explains how TOC fits into the bigger pictures of science, organizations, and business. Then explains how to introduce TOC into a company so it will be supported by top management with enough force to obtain ""critical mass"" and become part of the organization. If you use this book to properly introduce TOC to your company, it will be very helpful. If you use this book for any other purpose, you will most likely be very disappointed."
3,the front gives--the back takes away!,"TOC is very well done....until you get to the the second half. Dr. Goldratt would have done better if he could have teamed with someone to offer techniques on the psycology side. His TOC is however, very well explained in the front half of the book."
4,"A must read, but not as much detail as the other Tucker book","This book is a great account of the early development of the Tucker car, the design phase involving clay model development and selection between Alex Tremulis and Lippincott designers (which included author/designer Phil Egan). Beyond that the book glosses over the story of Preston Tucker, the early development of the car, and the downfall of the company in the SEC trial. While this book is a must read for Tucker historians and enthusiasts, a much better and more thorough biography on Tucker is Charles Pearson's ""The Indomitable Tin Goose"". Buy both and read both!"
1,A LESS THAN ONE STAR EFFORT,"Except for ""Till You Love Me"" (which even though is a good song is still overdone), the rest of this album is really, really bad. The worst two songs on here are ""I Wouldn't Wanna Be You"" and ""I Won't Stand In Line"". Her big hits ""THe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"" (which is a pop song through and through and ""And Still"" an o.k. ballad but nothing to compare with ""For My Broken Heart"" or ""You Really Better Love Me After This"" (her crowning performance in my opinion from her Behind the Scene album on Mercury)are on here but they aren't worth the time. If you like pop rhythms and sounds, this is the album for you!! If you want straight ahead country you'd better look somewhere else."
1,ONE OF HER WEAKEST,"Only Three SOngs here merit praise. ""Read My Mind"", ""He Thinks His Name Was John"" and ""Till You Love Me"". The rest is just the regular old pop stuff Reba likes to do and what most of her fans like to hear. I am a Reba fan but I like very few of her pop songs. I am a true country fan and when she does it right, its pure magic. This one lacks that pure magic except for the three songs mentioned above. (I hate ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter!>...uggh!)"
1,"YES INDEED, REBA DID IT AGAIN..........","She again released an album of contemporary pop songs that should appeal to the ""kiddies"" who like this kind of ""so called music"". However, to the serious country music fan, this is an insult to the term ""country music"". If Reba wants to appeal to all people then at least include some tunes in there that half way resemble ""traditional country music""."
2,I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE.,"IMO this is one of Reba's most dismal failures. It may have gone platinum for her because of her large fan base but it isn't because she's got quality stuff on here. Only ""Till You Love Me"" and ""She Thinks His Name Was John"" are worth listening to!"
1,Read MY mind......It Stinks!!!!,"Only die-hard McEntire fans will give her 5 star ratings for work that is nothing but Bubblegum Pop!!! I did like ""She Thinks His Name Was John"" and ""Till You Love Me"" but the rest of the CD has got to go!! Read MY mind....it Stinks!!"
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either","All I have to say is this, ""Every Thing That You Want"" is horrible compared to the emotions that Tanya Tucker put into it on her album What Do I Do With Me."
5,One of the Best Stock Market Books Around,"I'm proud to say I'm a friend of Darlene's. If you know her, you know what it's like to be in a powerful energy orbit. Her enthusiasm and passion for the stock market are unreal! Darlene and Miles have managed to somehow put this passion into words. The stock split strategies come alive as though Darlene is there with you teaching them. In some circles, Darlene is known as the Queen. Read this book and find out why."
3,Stock Split Secrets - extraordinarily verbose!,"While this book has some good ideas not addressed in the many other investment books I've read, there is a LOT of repetition. She outlines a topic, then repeats with detail, then repeats again to review with additional comments, etc. An executive summary of about 25 pages would have done it."
4,Good summary of Shaolin's history.,"This book has some interesting diagrams. The author says his research came from ""personal manuscripts"" (???) I would like to see a book that discusses the actual diet that the monks lived on - was it just rice??? A great intro to shaolin."
1,UFO Energy Ball has problems,Bought over a dozen and only three worked well and two more work inconsistently and all required more pressure then the one I had for years from Safari Toys. I use it in my inservices to demonstrate the power of our connectedness and our bodies as sources of energy that is connected to others. When broken we also disconnect other. I will look for a better quality product cause I love the teaching quality to the idea of it. The company accepts returns
4,Easy Read,"This book is an excerpt from the longer Pippi Longstocking book.My daughter really enjoys these stories-they're a little difficult for her to read alone, but we can get through it together pretty easily."
2,Cute but PAINFUL,"This shoe is very cute but the fabric is so stiff and rough that it made it impossible for me to wear them for more than 1/2 hour before I took them off. I do not like to have to ""break"" a shoe in. It's not just uncomfortable in the achilles area but around the front edge of where the fabric rubs on the foot as well. If there was some sort of padding sewn into the area under where you see the ribbon, then it would have made a big difference in the quality of the shoe. Oh well, I guess I got what I paid for."
4,Provides good arch support,"This product works as intended and helps give the extra arch support that I seek. Because the insoles are thin, they do not add bulk to my shoes and easily fit on top of the manufacturer's insoles. While the 3/4 length helps give more toe room, its only drawback is that the insoles tend to slide forwards and backwards in my shoes. I have been advised to velcro tabs to help with this issue."
1,NOT Water Proof,"My guess is that the water in the watch face is a pretty good indication this is not truly a ""water resistant"" watch to 99 feet. Our bathtub is maybe 16"" deep and that is the only place our 5 year old daughter has used this in the 2 days she has owned it. Bummer when your kid thinks she broke her birthday gift when in reality its just a cheap watch. Notifying the seller (through Amazon) and we'll see how that goes..."
5,Nice after product for your PT.,I bought this to cover up some scratches I had on the rear bumper. The bonus is how nice it looks on the car after it is applied. I would suggest buying this as soon as you get your car to minimize the scratches that you can get on a painted plastic bumper. I would also suggest that when you apply it to your bumper that you leave a small gap (1/8th of an inch) between the pad and the lift gate as not to jamb the lift gate. Application was a breeze. Nice sturdy product. Highly recommended.
3,B+,I'm in the market for a prepaid phone. Someone here mentioned checking the planetfeedback site to see ratings on tracfone. I did. It has the highest rating of any wireless phone service- prepaid or not.Looks like I'll be getting a tracfone.
4,Not a bad deal!,"For the ones who don't do a lot of talking, this is a good deal. They last 60 days, and the minutes rollover as long as you add more time within those 60 days! You can buy min. directly from thier website and get them instantly. If you're getting a new phone, you can get 100 minutes through the refferal program. E-Mail me at youngstev_2000@yahoo.com , I'll send over the link."
1,Tracfone service is terrible,"I've owned a Tracfone for 3 years. My old Tracfone quit working, so I purchased a new one. I've been trying for 4 weeks to transfer my old phone number to my new Tracfone. It's been a nightmare-after 4 weeks, 3 new sim cards, and countless calls to TracFone customer service reps, I've accomplished nothing. My phone is still not activated, I still don't have my old number transfered, and I've wasted 7 hours speaking to customer reps. I don't recommend TracFone."
3,this guitar,"is this guitar's firm ""sunburst"" or i am wrong? if i am wrong can someone tell me what firm is this guitar?"
3,Good book but not key to the series.,"Not my favorite book of this series. I could hardly put the book down reading the first trilogy of the Sword of Truth series and found the second set of three volumes quite gripping as well. This book was a decent read but I would not be hooked on the series from reading it. It is good enough that I will buy the next volume, and I feel like I got my moneys worth, but it is only lightly connected to the full series and would not have hooked me on the series or author on its own."
5,A great but misunderstood story,"Terry Goodkind is probably one of the best authors that I have read, his books are incredible and worth reading more than once (Faith of the Fallen my favorite I read seven times) however this book doesnt seem to be getting the respect it deserves. Terry has managed to tie up a lot of loose ends and gives your a better perspective of the world then you've ever had before but a lot of people are upset because it doesnt have a lot of everyones favorite charecters. As we all know Terry likes to put a lot behind his charecters to give them depth. This is a whole book that Terry put behind a whole new charecter and by the end you feel like you really know her.If your looking for non stop adventures and seeing who old gang slaying the order then maybe this book isnt for you (theres some seens with zedd and addy where you find out why zedd is the wind of death, you gatta see it guys.) but if you want a good story and more of Terry's genious this is for you."
2,Anybody Seen Richard?,"Not to say that this wasn't well written, it just wasn't what I expected of the book. I was seriously let down when I discovered that it wasn't a follow up to Faith of the Fallen.Though emotional, I think Mr. Goodkind spent too much time explaining the hatred his sister felt for him, and despite hearing from the various people she meets on her travels that Richard Rahl was a good person, the anger and prejudice stay until the very end of the book.I found that aspect of the story rather tiring, to be honest. It seemed too repetetive for my tastes.If one is not seeking a sequal to Faith of the Fallen, this isn't a bad read. Just don't expect anything spectacular."
5,There is still hope,"Im giving this book 5 stars (although it probably deserves four)just because I dont think that it is fair that it has a tow and a half average. Come on everybody knows that this is no Stone of Tears (the best book of the series), but we had been asking after book 5 a lot of things that we hadnt been getting since wizards first rule, stone of tears and the tempel of the winds... This book definetly opens the door for a new comeback for ""the basics"" of a sword of truth book, so dont be hasty to bury sword of truth, there is still hope"
3,Jordan and Goodkind Together Again,"After waiting months for the next installment in the Sword of Truth saga. I was deftly dissipointed in what I read. While the story line was excellent, I began to wonder ""What happened"". It seems Terry Goodkind is starting to follow in the footsteps Of Robert Jordan. We're getting off the track of the story here. Where I was expecting the continuing story of Richard and Kaylan I got Oba and Jennsen? Richard wasn't even brought into the story (other than mentioning his exploits)until the very last chapter.A great series has turned away from what's important to it's loyal fans. To, as we see it, a way of dragging out the story to sell more books. But in my opinion, it's a good way of losing your audience"
1,I really don't understand,"I really don't understand how a man like this could become an author. To begin with, the plot is emensly childish in all of his books so far ( dont ask me why I've read them all). Secondly, his characters are so transparent, unrealistic and uncreative, it makes me doubt that he actually wrote the book without an editor. Every chapter of this book, and all of his books, served only to add to the mound of spontanious rabel that he aimed to serve as a plot. I can say nothing positive about this book. Overal, I really think it is the worst book I've ever read. Please stay away from it, and all books by this author for the sake of your mind"
2,"I really, really tried... ** SPOILERS**","I understand what Goodkind was going for here. I agree with the Pugh review that he was attempting to challenge his fans (of which I am one and still remain...) to see Richard from a unique perspective. But I just couldn't get into it. I think the book would have worked better if Goodkind focused more on Jennsen and never bothered us with Oba. He spent way too much time on Oba who's actions could have been served by anyone from, say, the Sisters of the Dark or even Sebastian. Plus, it was kind of confusing when we're one minute with Richard in the forest, and then - BAM! - we're at the Pillars and the story suddenly comes to and end with no set up.I was disappointed in this portion of what is otherwise a brilliant series. I hope the next book is better."
4,I liked it,"As everyone else has already stated, I was a little disapointed that we dont get to see Richard and Kahlan as much. But besides that fact I had a hard time putting the book down. I liked how it tied in to the main plot with stuff about the war. A lot of people say it didnt flow with the rest of the books but I disagree I thought it flowed well.Overall Im rating it a 4 out of 5 because of the lack of the main characters but I still recommend it as a good read."
3,So-so,Too little Richard and Kahlen. Too much Oba. Too long to develop story. Actually quit reading for a month before picking back up.
5,very great book,this was a very excellent book. i very much believe that goodkind out did himself. i found that this book is one that somebody should read if they are reading the series.
1,Not worth reading,I have enjoyed the series -- up to this point. I had to force myselfto finish reading Pillars of Creation. If this had been the first bookin the series that I read it also would have been the last. Not sure ifI want to read any more after this.
1,I can not believe how bad this book is!,"I am so utterly depressed about this book. After waiting so long to find out about Richard and Khalan, and how they will deal with the impending war, the out come of the rebellion, and the rest of the lose threads....we get this! This is a lame book about a lame character. I have been a devout reader of this series, but this has got to be the worst disappointment I have had since I have started reading. Richard and Khalan are only after thoughts in this book and only come into play the last few chapters. This has to be joke, this can't be the real book right? I can't say enough about how badly this book sucks, so I have to stop before I get really upset!"
4,It's good to add perspective,I like this book because it advances the series from a different point of view. The writing is just as good and there is less 'beat the readers over the head' Ayn Rand type philosophy.
2,The Series That Never Ends,"I'm not going to jump on either bandwagon here -- I'm not a diehard fan (though I've read them all), and I'm not a huge fan of the digression, either. I borrowed this book, and read it, and was glad I hadn't paid for it.Goodkind seems to suffer from the same disease Robert Jordan does. It's the ""I'm going to write the series that never ends"" disease. I don't blame him for wanting to write about someone else -- but Terry just couldn't leave his series alone (probably because of the extra several tens of thousands of copies he'll sell by putting it in the series proper). This story would have been a much better, more interesting book if he had written it ""next to"" the storyline, but not interacting in a meaningful way. It was written because he needed to add another major twist to his series to lengthen it another few books. That's just plain annoying.Finish this series, Terry, and let's move on to another incredible world (or storyline) ... Please ..."
3,"Not One of His Best, But Still Underated","When I discovered who the book was going to be revolved around, I nearly had a fit! ""Why does Goodkind think I'd want to read about anyone other than Richard and Kahlan???"" But, I gave in and read it. And, to my suprise, it was good. Not his best, though. If you're looking for finer examples of Goodkind's writings, read earlier books in the Sword Of Truth series, they are much better. However, this book is a must if you're a Sword Of Truth fan. Somehow Goodkind continues to combine unlikely coincidences with a frighteningly realistic plot and characters to match. As with all the rest of Goodkind's characters, you grow to love some new ones. Jennsen, Sebastion, Tom and - yes, even the goat, Betty all touch your heart. So, my recomendation? Do NOT read this book if you have not read the rest of the series. It will ruin the book and the series for you. If you have read the rest of the series, and plan to continue reading, read this book. It's worth it."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"If you want to read more about the exploits of Richard and Kahlan, go back and reread the first couple books in the Sword of Truth Series.The book, while it DOES involve random, uninteresting characters, features only token appearances by the main cast in the rest of the Sword of Truth series, and is not worth buying. Also, except for the fact that Goodkind has outlined how the magic in his world will die out in a couple thousand years, there seem to be no outward plot developments... The Imperial Order is unaffected, as are all the nations under Richard.Hopefully, this book was a mistake that Goodkind will put behind him; I know that many of us readers would hate to think that he has dried up as badly as Robert Jordan seems to have.As a whole, this book left me abysmally dissappointed."
2,Sword of Truth Series???,"I thought I was purchasing a book from the Sword of Truth series. Funny how it was barely mentioned and the main characters are on the outside looking in for most of the story. If Terry would like to branch out into other characters I would recommend him to pursue other short stories like the ""Debt of Bones"" that chronicled Zedd's early years (which I recommend!). I have been a rabid fan since discovering this series and have found this edition to be a huge disappointment. This IS a Sword of Truth Series book, right?"
3,A long tale is refreshed,"I got plugged into this series with the first episode. Great tale with real characters. Ensuing editions left me wondering why I continued. Then this episode invigorated my attention and thoroughly enjoyed the new places Mr. Goodkind was taking me to.I would pity the first time reader who picks up any of the editions of this saga and tries to put the pieces together. ""The Pillars of Creation"" is almost a stand alone novel and does showcase the talents of Goodkind with glimmers of the brilliance that launched the ""Sword of Truth"" franchise."
5,Pillars of Creation,This Terry Goodkind book was purchased as a Christmas gift and part of a book collection. It arrived on time and in good condition. Thanks
4,Good read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as well as the entire series. They do become dry in occasion as the author goes into the nitty gritty detail in his desciptions of areas or explanantions of thoughts and actions. I was also annoyed with the way he repeats specific statements throughout the series. Explaining that Zed is Richards grandfather, is a first wizard and that he made Richard the Seeker of Truth as an explanation to a new character but is unnecesary for the reader. That cost the 5th star"
1,Struggling to read this junk,I've greatly enjoyed reading the Sword of Truth series. I thought Faith of the Fallen was one of the best of them with an amazing amount of character development. Afterwards I was struck with a mighty blow to the head with this book. I'm only 360 pages into it and have to battle to read it after starting MANY months ago. I just don't care at all about any of the the dull characters. So far the one I care about the most is Tom! Maybe I will eventually finish it so I can move on to a good book. Wish me luck. END THE SERIES!
1,Where did everybody go?,"Ok we spent time, money, and effort reading the all the other books getting to know the characters. Then what happens? They all disappear. I found myself skipping 10 to 20 pages at a time of drawn out boring dialogue from characters that we don't care about. (And this occured alot throughout the book) Ones we know will end up dead. It also seems that every book brings out a new sister of the dark briefly then we kill her off. All of his books are delightful even though they all seem to borrow everything from other fantasy and fiction writers. The reason I read books in series' is because there are a cast of characters you grow to know and love, Goodkind might as well have killed them all off, you only hear about them in the last 30 pages or so of this 550 page book"
3,We get it already!,"First, let me say that this was a decent book ... and decent is about all I can say for it. This is not so much that it wasn't a good story, but more of a ... Ok, we get the whole capitalist system versus socialist system argument you are making! We get it ... really we do. The problem is that BOTH of the main bad guys were essentially socialists, so it almost seems like Terry killed off Darken Rahl, a socialist, just to put in another socialist bad buy. This is causing a bit of redundancy in the overall story, a bit of boredom with the over-arching storyline. While Terry certain weaves a great story, I'm finding myself growing bored with the series itself. Unless something DRASTICALLY changes with Naked Empire, that will probably be the last book of this series I read."
4,Break from Richard,"This was such a good book. 7th book, 7th heaven. The only problem was, I had no idea what they were talking about in the end! Oh, and also, there was almost no Richard, Cara, or Kahlan. However, there was more Nathan, which is cool."
1,"Awesome, a new protaganist....","and yet the series is still horrible, what gives? I mean how can you not find a series exciting and refreshing when plotlines are rehashed and characters are interchangeable."
3,not enough action,"I felt this book didn't have enough action with the characters we have grown to love. Terry Goodkind tells a flowing story that read fast, but didn't further the saga. The book had its moments, but as whole it was pointless. Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd are in only about 60 pages. The character Oba was a complete waste. After Faith of the Fallen this was a let down"
4,A fresh breath into the series.....,"I am not at all dissappointed with the change of characters in this book. Since I have started reading this series, Richard and Co have become like friends to me, and now, Jennsen has been has been added. Just like I felt the struggles with Richard and Kahlan, I feel the same for Jennsen. I understand this book is written how Jennsen perceives the world, and Terry Goodkind does great at giving the reader that perspective.Overall, I enjoyed this, however, I gave this book four stars instead of 5 because of the goat, and I did not care much for Oba. Oba was twisted and evil, but very stupid. Between Oba, and the goat, I was going to give this book 3 1/2 stars, but, since Oba lost a physical confrontation to Nyda, that brought my rating up a notch. As far as the goat, if Jennsen really needed to have a pet, I believe a dog would of been more suitable. Overall, this book is a good read."
1,Goodkind continues his degredation of the series,"Wizards First Rule was one of the best books in the fantasy genre I have read and the subsequent books have done at best, kept my interest (2 and 3 were really good). God, I mean the main character seems to have become a more special and powerful person with every book. I did not mind the war wizard thing a while back, but the statue that made the entire city cry and revolt in the last book? Come on. This entire series just appears somewhat to cliche. This has just become a never ending tale of Richard vs. the big bad world (whomever the great evil at time seems to be).Goodkind's writing really seems to have come down to extending the series and not doing high quality work. Don't get me wrong, The Pillars of Creation isn't a bad book and I think it is worth reading if you have read all the others, but it leaves alot to be desired."
5,Pillars of Creation,"As with this entire series, Terry Goodkind has done a wonderful job. Some times itseems to drag, but a great series."
2,The worst so far...Pretty Awful actually...,"I loved this series- I could not stop reading each and every one of them cover to cover up until this piece of garbage. Its almost like TG handed over his writing to an author of much much lessor quality - like one of those cheesy books based off of a video game like ""Starcraft"" or something. It is sad.I still finished this book, but man I could not wait for it to end!!! Boring, with a plot that made you hate every character introduced. This reminds me of the new Eddings books- I loved all his old work, but really really hate his new stuff... its almost like they stopped thinking when writing and play to a 'dumber' audience!I will get the next one in the series- just in case he can pick up the pieces...sigh."
3,**Warning this is not the best in the series**,The first time I listened to this I didn't like it. The author doesn't let us know what happened to Richard and Kahlan until close to the end of the book. I listened again a year later and am enjoying it more. For those who know the story and have become familiar with the characters please stick with this book. It's actual not all that bad.You will be introduced to new characters.
4,Even if you start in the middle.,"What I thought was interesting about this novel is that even though I was unfamiliar with the series and this is my first time reading this author, I was able to pick it up cold and enjoy it cover to cover."
4,A Child's Calendar,"A Child's Calendar, a Caldecott award winner, by John Updike is a specialized poetry book that includes twelve lyric poems each describing unique characteristics of each month in the year for children to gain meaning and understanding of each individual month. Eleven of the twelve poems are written in four and five stanzas. The twelfth poem is written in six stanzas. Each stanza is structured in quatrains, containing four lines with the rhyming occurring in only two of the lines. The rhyming occurs in lines two and four of each stanza. Illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman add visual images to help the children better understand some of the characteristics and activities occurring in each month."
5,a great read,Taylor manages to take interesting political science concepts and merge them into an amazing story filled with non stop action and drama. I highly recommend this book.
1,Didn't work as expected,"The light and siren did not work on this toy, even though the battery protector was still in place. We will need to buy new batteries to determine if the batteries are dead or the part is defective. The doors fell off and were difficult for a child to put back on without adult help."
2,dreams for all people without strings,"This book gives true info about the dream state, but I have a question that needs answering---if the dream state is real and aguide, what would this author say about someone who had so manydreams they couldn't keep up, like for 25 years of them and these dreams were prophetic dreams about herself and her husband inthe very path of Eckankar that Harold Klemp presides over?Would he accept these dreams and would he then believe indreams as readily? This makes me wonder about this author havingauthority about dreams, since my dreams have been denigratedby members of this group."
5,Happy Happy Happy,"This book did it for me. I can finally recall my dreams! If i could give it 10 stars i would! Don,t take my word for it, try it out for your self!"
3,Alright in some parts,"I watched bits and pieces of I Spy Returns! The action is awsome!the onlything wrong is that fact that later in the movie, it shows culps and cosbys balls, which I'm not all that happy with but otherwise, the movie's pretty good."
1,Impotent Popcorn,As an alternate to the high fat microwave popcorn and noisy hot air poppers. I wanted to pop my own popcorn - the old fashioned way over the stove in a pot. This was a dissapointment. Nearly half the kernels never pop and the kernels that do pop are very small. I'll try buying other kernels but I would not buy this again.
4,Works great; use with rope lights,"This was just what I needed for my dark pantry. However, I mounted it down low near the bottom of the door and screwed one of those Socket-To-Outlet Adapters into it to turn it into an outlet. I plugged in a set of rope lights and ran in around the trim on the INSIDE of the pantry doorway. This way, the entire pantry is lit up each time I open the door. I don't even see the actual rope lights and the automatic closet light is down low on the door jamb where I don't even notice it. Inexpensive, effective, not too unattractive.To see the socket-to-outlet adapter, just search on Amazon for ""socket to outlet adapter."""
2,Grabación de muy baja calidad.....,"El video tiene una calidad de edición pésima. Parece que tenían una sola cámara para filmar todas las tomas. En una de las escenas,aparecen dos de los niños actores en un sitio y de inmediato aparecen en otro, es como para decir que paso allí???? No se, sería magia. Tal vez deban cambiarle el nombre a la película como Los Solecitos mágicos o algo así. Otra cosa los niños que actuan en la película no hablan bien el español y el diálogo es dificil de entender en algunas ocasiones. En realidad mi niña de año y medio no se da cuenta y se lo disfruta igual. Pero yo quedé mal cuando lo ví."
2,A huge dissapiontement,I had really wanted to read this book for quite a while but it always seemed that the book was either sold or checked out and I was really glad when I found it at Powels books store in Portland. I read the first chapter and thought that this looked like a pretty promising book but after the second chapter I though that the dialouge was sooo cheesy and also ver unnatural not to mention that you could see right through the plot. I do NOT suggest this book to anyone.
3,GREAT,"This was a very interesting book. I loved it. I recently gave it to a friend of mine for her birthday. But I don't think I will ever read it again;it's one of those books you can't put down when you get it, but you forget so easily."
1,Too Long Too Predictable,"I liked the Inkheart series, but... this book was too predictable and too long. Because of the simplicity of the plot, characters, and dialogue, I feel that it could have made for a very cute picture book, but this was not a great chapter book - and I feel most kids would not have the patience to stick with it."
2,Its pretty good but as good as Eragon,The is not the best a fiction story can be but I like a little bit.
3,probably her best yet...but still not great,"i am not a fan of this author. her work is boring and unbelievable. i don't know if the translation loses something but i know that i have never like anything by cornelia funke. however, i must admit that dragon rider is the best book by this author so far. i own the copy that includes a map of the areas traveled and i had a fun time using it as a reference, making sure i could follow the storyline. i really hope this author can write some more imaginative books in the future...books that will match the illustrations."
3,Dragon Rider....,"Dragon Rider, an awesome fantasy, tells of a group of dragons who are in harms way at their current residence. Firedrake a silver dragon, and Sorrel (a Brownie) embark on a journey to unveil the location of the Rim of Heaven, a dragon refuge to those who find it. In the process they meet Ben (an orphan boy) whom Firedrake invites to come along. However, they must beware of Nettlebrand, the Golden One (a man-made Golden Dragon), for he has spies everywhere (including a reluctant manikin, Twigleg) and loves the taste of Silver Dragon. The adventure becomes a thrilling fairy tale upon the encounter of humans, dwarves, and enchantment. You'll fly though the pages like Firedrake. I found the book entertaining and magical with some flaws. I rate Dragon Rider three out of five stars."
5,Fantastic fun!! Ages 6 & up will love this!,"This was an exciting adventure to read (age 35) and my son (age 7) adored it as well. There were many wonderful themes (friendship, betrayal, prejudice) that were explored in safe, non-violent ways. There was a bit of menace in the ""bad guy"" character, but nothing too graphic, violent or scary. This is delight for young and old alike! I read it first as I enjoyed ""The Thief Lord"" and began this one, not anticipating it for my son, as ""The Thief Lord"" was for an older reader than he is. But this was so much fun, I had to give it to him as well.Enjoy!!!"
4,Fan Club,"I purchased this for my son's room. It was shipped in a timely manner. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality - it was not too heavy or too flimsy. I was able to secure it to the wall by using poster strips. So far, it has not fallen down."
5,Worth Reading,"I found this book to be very well written. It was helpful to me as I search to better my understanding of God. This book informed, but did not put me down. I am presently re-reading it and getting even more out of it."
4,Good except for one omission,"I just had a very brief comment to make.Overall, I found this book contained a lot of good information about the Goths. I would have liked more information on the Visigoths, as he doesn't really discuss where they came from, how they were organized and so on, very much. Except for this one main omission, a good history, overall.Aside from the history contained here, I found this book valuable for the brief discussion in the introduction about the practical and theoretical difficulties of connecting cultural traits with a people's identity, and vice-versa. I hadn't thought about this before, except in vague terms. Heather shows the problems with this approach to history and civilization."
5,"Waugh. As always, superb.","Evelyn Waugh cannot be outdone. He can never cease to please. His style is sly, it is witty, and of course contagiously beautiful, which I will make no effort to explain. Just read him. One cannot have an expectation too high to be fulfilled."
4,Snuffy,"Snuffie is soft, cuddly and adorable. Great quality too!Just a little smaller than we expected."
5,"Sexy, Smooth, Stuff.","I'm A smooth jazz lover and this has to be some of the smoothest, sexiest, music I've ever heard. The arrangements are enjoyable to listen to. Also there are some fun tunes as well that keep your feet tapping. I saw this young man on CBS' The Early Show featuring Bryant Gumbel and Jane Clayson. He actually wrote the theme music to the show and Gumbel was admiring his work and promoting this cd ""Chris Bowman, First Love"". I would suggest this product to anyone who loves good smooth jazz. It's a must for your collection. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Wish my favorite movie did not come as part of a collection,"I have been looking for the movie Marty forever and it was included in this collection. Marty is such a great movie. It was made over 50 years ago and is so sweet. Can you even imagine? A movie with no nudity, violence or cursing and still be a great movie. I would defintely recommend this movie. Just unhappy that I had to buy a ""collection"" to get it."
3,Excellent book!,"Excellent!What a great book - something to laugh, cry, learn, wonder, guess... and there are surprises till the end!What a truly gifted and talented writer.I love this book just like all the others he wrote!"
2,Save your Money,"If you are looking for a DVR that you can use with your Home AV system and take on the road, save your money and do not buy this device. The menuing system is HORRIBLE. Why they invented button icons instead of using standard conventions is beyond me. There should be one SELECT button, but there are several, depending upon which menu you are in. Just changing the sound from headphones to internal speaker is difficult. The internal speaker is OFF when it looks like it is on, and ON when it looks like it is off. You must also keep movie file size around 1gb or the playback will only show up to that point! Hooking it up to a home system works, but can be tricky depending upon the number of inputs you have on your home theater system. It is a cool device, but the drawbacks make it not worth the price. I'm a total techie, and this device stays in a drawer because it is just too difficult to work the device."
1,Pathetic,I can't say the word demagogue enough...an absolutely awful book that reads more like a political manifesto than a non-fiction work. I use the term non-fiction loosly.
1,Cannot recommend.,"THis gate sounds great, you can step over it and it installs easily. But the pressure isn't great and it often needs to be re-installed. You have to bend over to open pet door, not good if you have back problems. THe latch pinches your fingers (and your childs'!) Ouch. And the darn thing fell apart on me. This was a waste of money. Made in china quality!"
4,Not for beagles,"The gate is sturdy and works well. Installation is painless. My only gripe is all the pictures of beagles shown on the page, as if the gate can hold a beagle. I have a beagle and she was able to jump over the gate easily. Gate should be targeted at smaller pets."
4,Works great for Westies!,Our West Highland White Terriers stay behind this fence and the little door is handy. Our gate was broken after a couple of years of good hard use. I assume it was accidentally kicked by one of my sons our their football lineman friends. I thing it would take a serious collision to break it but it did happen. We just duck taped the gate together and we still use it but without the ability to open the door.
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","Great product, easy to set up and very sturdy--so much better than the other brands I've tried before and the shorter height is perfect to keep our bassett hound away from the cat food!"
3,Not as shown,This gate works well. But is not as photo shows. Photo makes it look finished and the wood has no finish at all. The knobs are not attached and are not as shown in photo. Very hard to adjust as the knobs just push into larger than screw holes. They are not attached to the gate. The handle for the door mechanism is flimsy. I am keeping only because of the height of the gate. High priced for what you get.
5,Great gate!,This gate is perfect. I have a room that I want to allow my cats in but make sure the pekingese cannot get in. It's easy to step over. I didn't have any problem with the installation. Set the bumper against the door and twirl the wings back toward the gate. Would likely not be useful for a dog that can jump. Sturdy gate at a great price.
5,so compact,I was a bit skeptical about this mouse. But It seems to work great and I love the on/off feature. Now I don't have to worry about putting it in it's base every time I get through using it to charge it. It's very comfortable to hold also.
5,nice,"Really nice mouse, would have been nicer if it was a rechargable mouse. very comfortable grip as well."
3,Nice mouse but disappointing range,I have bought this mouse both for my laptop and desktop. I like the mouse but have trouble using it with my desktop. Basically it is very hard too use at about 6 feet range (clear from any obstacles and not too close to any other device that might cause interference). The movement is not smooth and clicks are often dropped. I really expected more from this higher end mouse.I'm now using Comfort Duo which works fine in the same set-up.
5,Excellent mouse! Rec'd to friends,"I've used the VX Revolution on a laptop for a month now, the tracking precision and control is very good, the feel is solid, and the line-of-sight range is at least 18 feet. The five buttons and scroll wheel includes a magnifier button to enlarge the screen display, very handy for viewing small print. An on/off switch to save battery, a storage compartment for the USB transceiver are great. Definitely designed for right-handers, and I use mice ambidextrously all the time. It survived a weeklong roadtrip packed with the laptop no problem. I'm recommending it to friends who are looking for a mouse that has it all. As usual, Amazon delivered it fast and as advertised. :)"
4,Amazing technology,"This thing is amazing for what they've packed inside such a small case. Unfortunately, it conflicted with my desktop computer. I use it with my laptop, now, and so far, haven't noticed the instability its software caused to my desktop computer. Perhaps, the larger desktop version would not have these problems??????"
4,Awsome Mouse. Ok Range. Hard M3 button.,"This mouse is slick and very comfertable in your hand.Clicking the scroll wheel down as a button is pretty hard.When i have this mouse to the right of my laptop and the usb peice is pluged into the left side I get some interference and the mouse stops here and there. So the range could be better.The zoom slider is kool too, also a bit hard to move on this light mouse but it works good, I use it to control volume :DThe feature of changing the mouse scroll speed is awsome! you can make it like a free wheel that keeps spinning for a good 10 seconds on one rev! (but I dont know why you would need that lol)Works fine on most surfaces and is very portable because the usb peice clicks into the mouse, which turns the mouse off, and vice versa if you take it out by pressing a button in the back, the thing comes out and mouse turns on! :)I would recommend it to people who have usb on the back and right of their laptop and dont mind a hard to scroll wheel."
4,Good mouse,The only problem I have with this mouse is that the zoom and scroll buttons could be more sensitive or easier to push down. Other then that this mouse great.
3,Logitech VX Revolution,"The product is very good, but even it is refurbisher, I would expect a little more from the ""package"" I bought. It is really only the mouse and that's it. No sofware, no nothing. I was expecting something more Logitech like. But the product is Ok and the srvice from the vendor was very good. I still classified like average product and deal.Again the store was very eficient and honest."
5,This mouse is exceptional,"That product gets a five start review because the ergonomics is simply **exceptional**. It's by far the best mouse I have ever had in 2 decades of computing. I really don't care about the fancy buttons (zoom and other customizable features) because in the end, all what counts is how comfortable the mouse feels (plus the scroll and back button) - to me, it's just a perfect impression. Before buying, I went to a brick and motar shop to compare different brands and models. That one was made a stellar impression on me. I think it's far better than the desktop model. The storable micro-receiver is a nice touch as well as the software power level indicator.It worked flawlessly on several computers. I have one for home and one for work."
2,Horrible mouse.,"I used to be a Logitech ""fanboy"". Keyboard, mouse, speakers, webcam... all Logitech. After problems I've had with my last two mice, and the problems I've had with my G15 keyboard... I think I've been broken of my infatuation with Logitech.The problems with this particular mouse started after just a few months. Occasionally the mouse wouldn't register a click, which worsened with time. Eventually, it started having trouble tracking as well, while the clicking issue worsened. Changed to a new battery? Issue persisted. When the mouse works, it works well... but after dealing with computers for the last 15+ years I can assure you that a mouse shouldn't go bad this quickly."
1,Software for this mouse makes Macbooks Freeze and Crash - No Bueno!,"Ok, in terms of the mouse itself, it feels nice and all buttons feel and look good. The BIG problem is that the Logitech software that you need to install to be able to program the buttons and scroll wheel causes the Mac to freeze up and crash. As soon as you uninstall the software then the Mac is fine. For reference, I am running a Macbook 2.0 Core Duo with 2 GB Ram and 80GB Harddrive, 13.3inch (black one). So for Mac owners beware. I am returning this mouse back to Amazon. The mouse works but you can't use any of the programmable buttons which kills the whole point of buying a mouse like this."
1,"The bulbs are ok, but I missed the outrageous shipping!","This is one of those companies that charge a reasonable price, but make it up on overpriced shipping."
4,Do dittoheads comprehend satire?,"It's hilarious to see Limbaugh skewered by his own method (resorting to name-calling), and equally hilarious to read the comments of those who just can't seem to figure that out. I particularly enjoyed the conversations with RL's fact-checker(""easiest job in America"")... Although it seems most people already know how they feel about Limbaugh and his ilk, this book would make a great litmus test."
2,Glad i did not buy this...,"I read it, it's interesting. Then I looked up its sales and realized it was a total disaster, and I along with many can see why. Also, like most of the politically correct left (liberalism was hijacked many years ago by the left, oooppps, I am sorry, by the ""progessives"") Mr. fat face Franken, opppps, a bad bigoted statement I just said, oh my, anyway, buck tooth Franken presents mostly his semantics and opinions as if they are truth and fact. Even Ingraham's book ""Shut UP ..."" addresses the issues from left to right, up and down; whereas, Mr. Franken (now wallowing in oblivion after FOX Network's dumb suit brought him 15 minutes more of fame) just presents his, well, ""better"" opinion(s) for all of us. I once met Mr. Franken in a social setting. His boorish behavior he considers amusing; his typed words in his books he considers intelligent."
1,I'd rather buy dirt.,What a sad excuse for an attempt to make Rush Limbaugh look bad! Fortunately Rush is brighter than this guy says and knows just to ignore it and keep on speaking the truth.
5,"A laugh riot from cover to cover, even the Index!!","Franken delivers the fat mans lies with deadly accuracy at the funny bone.Rush and the right-wingers supply the material, and Franken brings it home.Truly a very funny read for anyone who isn't brainwashed by Rush, which is his fans, of course."
4,great except for the Affirmative Action Chapter,"This is a wonderful book. Its not too intense and is funny almost throughout. The only problem, where Al's reasoning falls flat is on the affirmative action issue. He points to Thomas as a hippocrite for challenging affirmative action after benefiting from it when he was admitted to law school. The obvious arguement, and one that Thomas has given several times is that during the early seventies, racism and lack of diversity was much more of a problem than it is today. He and people like him argue that it was a good program but has run its course. Al is usually good about this kind of reasonable arguement and states them in his books...but not in this case.BTW: im very pro affirmative action, but I like to understand both sides fairly.david"
1,Liberal rhetoric best used for toilet paper,"Al Franken is about as entertaining as watching fellow liberal Dan Rather interview Saddam Hussein. I have the cure for all insomniacs - read this farce of a book and you'll be cured instantly!And to think he's getting his own radio show to combat ""The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" of talk radio - Ha! It'll last about as long as Mario Cuomo's did. This book is an abominably ill-fated attempt at humor. It's unfathomable how the Left view him as their resident comedic genius - despite being nothing more than a...iberal zealot with an infinitesimal amount of talent."
3,Mildly entertaining.,"Several chapters in this book had me rolling with laughter. Several untruths and inconsistencies of Limbaugh and some of the Republican right are successfully highlighted. However, the book feels unfinished. Chapters are disjointed, as though a long time elapsed between writing adjacent chapters or as though more than one author were involved. Certainly, this book does not deliver a knockout blow, or anything close, to its targets and their campaign of misinformation.""Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot : And Other Observations"" is a relaxing read that will prove generally humerous for Democrats, but if you are an intelligent, rabid liberal or an intelligent, rabid conservative, there is nothing new here for you."
4,The greatest work since War and Peace,"I thought War and Peace was the greatest book I everread. That is of course until I read Al Franken's Rush Limbaugh is ABig Fat Idiot!^M ^MI hope Mr. Franken has shown his Vietnam chapter to Oliver Stone. It would make a great sequel to Platoon.^M ^MMy 9 and 12 year old sons appreciated Mr. Franken's critiques of Rush Limbaugh's ""facts"" like there are now more Native Americans and forests in the U.S. than when Columbus landed! Maybe Mr. Franken has also written a children's classic!^M ^MI enjoyed this mind candy of a book and recommend it as refreshing relief from the tiresome chorus of talk radio."
5,The funniest book ever.,"This book is so funny, anyone interested in politics should read it, even though it is funny, it is so correct."
2,Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot,Drop the Rush part and you got an autobiography. This guy is the idiot. Yes he is witty but nontheless it takes an idiot to write this. Now he is a senator and he is still an idiot.
1,"Rush Limbaugh is NOT a ""big fat idiot"" thank you.","Ah... I see the blood sucking liberal media has resorted to childish name-calling now. Pretty sad. I guess this book's title sums up pretty well the mind set of the liberals in this day and age: Frustrated, immature, and un-willing to accept the times that we live in. Ah well, to Al Franken[stein], I have a message, and I'll deliver it in a form I'm sure that his childish mind will be able to understand; ""Sticks and Stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me."""
3,"Good yoga, poor production quality","The DVD production did not meet my expectations. It was shot in a very bare and stark room; the quality was poor; and the selection of routines on the main menu was limited to two. I did not have the three 20-minute sections mentioned on the back of the DVD cover, nor did I have the access to the new triple screen format mentioned.At the same time, I enjoyed the yoga routine on this DVD - it was varied, energetic and included a large amount of abdominal work."
2,No de-stressing with this yog video,"While out of practice but definetly not new to yoga I found this video very difficult to follow. The voice over did not match the moves and I found myself plaing catch up the whole workout. There was little stretchng until the end of the workout. The only positive I can say was that it was a challenging workout, though definetely for a seasoned yogi's."
2,Disappointed,"i've read so much about sadie nardini and couldn't wait to try this. i'm a solid intermediate yogi, and the 1st 5-10 minutes had my lower back hurting. i didn't even bother finishing it. i just couldn't get into it, but maybe it's just me, because i've seen some great reviews for all of her videos. i much prefer Adi Amar and Oliver Reinsch's style. they both just have a much better flow to their yoga instruction that feels less forceful in my opinion."
5,Excellent vinyasa DVD,"I was first introduced to Sadie Nardini via her excellent youtube yoga videos. She has a phenomenal teaching style and her youtube videos were always excellent and extremely thorough. I always wondered why she didn't have a DVD out and then I found her Core Strength Vinyasa Yoga Power Hour! It was just released this year and I have to say, it is excellent!!! I think this is appropriate for beginners, intermediate or advanced yoga students. It really concentrates on and builds your core which is very important in yoga (and one of the areas where I am still a little weak). I can really feel my abs working during the DVD and definitely the next day! It moves at a nice pace, not too slow and not too fast. I am dripping in sweat after 60 minutes and I've been doing yoga for 2 years! It's a great workout!"
4,Rudolph is delightful,"I have always enjoyed ""Rudolph the red nosed reindeer"" and ordered the DVD. It's very good and as I remember the original many years ago. I'm sure I'll enjoy this for years to come."
5,AWESOM!!,"What more can I say? Just a great show in the first place, but well worth it to own on DVD - love the enhancement and it just goes to show good things are still made that can please both adults and kids!!"
3,Movie is 5 stars DVD is 3,WOW this is a DVD?!?The show is as it was in the TV release and the extras do bring it to the modern day but I think they (Sony Wonder/Golden Books) could have packed all the shows on One DVD instead of making you buy 3 of them... Look to Warmer Bros. Year w/o Santa Claus...Santa Claus is Coming to Town and Frosty could have made it all in this DVD... Well I got it in the collection and saved some over buying them one at a time...Enjoy the show and worry where the popcorn money will come from later...
4,Great special-except for one detail,"This is a great holiday special. I especially like the Island of Misfit Toys detail. The only reason I gave the special 4 stars rather than 5 stars is the detail in which Hermey pulls out the Bumble's teeth to make him safe(this could not be done to real-life animals that bite, for they cannot live without their teeth. I think this is improperly teaching the viewer that an animal who bites can have its teeth pulled to make it less harmful to humans. Therefore, I believe that this segment can easily send the wrong message to children.) Nevertheless, the special shows how okay it is to be different. Sometimes I cry when I watch the Island of Misfit Toys segment, but light up again with a smile when I see the misfit toys being dropped out of the sleigh at the end. If you have the older VHS, be sure to upgrade to this DVD version with the original song, ""We're A Couple of Misfits."" The ""Fame and Fortune"" song is included as a bonus feature."
1,This is Worst X-mas Special I have seen,"The soundtrack is bad, it sounds like a music box with almost(dead) batteries. The message is bad. They say X-Mas is gonna be cancled. HOW CAN WE CANCEL X-MAS? THAT IS LIKE SAYING X-MAS IS ALL ABOUT PRESENTS? X-MAS IS NOT ABOUT PRESENTS, IT MEANS MUCH, MUCH MORE. Also the amount of songs on it is truly annoying combined with the extremely bad soundtrack. Also it is very bad in another way, too. ""We need to get the women back to christimas-town."" So women are helpless. NO THEY ARE NOT. Women and Men are 100% equal. They treat rudloph badly because of his nose. Should we treat people badly because they are different? I DO NOT THINK SO. DO NOT BUY THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE!!! SPEND IT ON ANOTHER X-MAS SPECIAL LIKE ""A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS"" OR THE GRINCH."
5,All-Time Favorate,"One of the best Christmas stories for kids. I grew up watching this, now I am passing the tradition to my daughter. She kept her eyes glued to the screen. And, I still like watching it, too. Must be the kid in me coming out at Christmas."
5,Christmas Classic for children and adults!,"Leave everything behind you, sit down next to the fireplace, drink hot coco and watching this special Christmas Classic ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" where you will enjoy watching Rudolph's greatest adventure along with Christmas songs, colorful scenic and encounter the abominable snow monster."
3,"Very confused, as the one I bought looks pirated... very poor quality...","I just bought this DVD at the U.S. Post Office, expecting to see a clean digitally re-mastered Rudolph... to my surprise, the DVD I have has lines and spots, as if copied from an old film strip. I'm very dismayed and confused. Doesn't sound like others are having this complaint, so did the Post Office purchase pirated DVDs for resell? Strange..."
4,THIS IS A GIFT.,"The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is because this is a gift so I haven't opened it to play it. Otherwise I received on time, in perfect order as far as the packaging goes. I have NO idea as to how it plays. My friend will have to tell me that once she opens it."
4,A Christmas special inspired by a favorite Christmas carol,"Ah, yes, I've seen many times this Christmas special by the well-known likes of Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass, who later created the famous ""Thundercats"" 2-D animation series. Rankin and Bass have done such a great job in classical animation that it reminds me of the later ""Claymation"" features by Will Vinton or whatever his name is. A great treat if you like Rankin and Bass."
5,THE BEST IMPORT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Nosatsu Live is by far the best import I have ever heard. Yeah we have heard all the songs, but still it's a must buy and you feel like you are at one of their shows!!"
1,Lacks depth and emotion,"while the organ parts are good in some songs, I was looking for something powerful and dynamic in an orchestral sense. Every song sounds like it was done on a cheap keyboard...very synthesized and thin. If you're looking for moving, powerful, full-orchestra style pieces that shake your emotions, then look elsewhere!"
4,What if?,"What if the one that got away came back into your life? What would you do? We often think about the one that got away and the choices we've made about dating. This book answered these questions for Beau. It was a really good book. I was able to guess which Mike she picked (only by luck; nothing that the author gave away). It's a easy, fun read. Good way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon."
3,That Eighties Show,"Wendy Markham takes a big step up from her previous work in ""Mike, Mike and Me,"" but she's starting from below street-level. ""Mike"" is pretty silly and unbeliveable, and the heroine violates the basic rules of the genre: She's gorgeous and perfect, so why exactly do we want to read about her? And the constant '80s references get tiring about 10 pages in--even for those of us who were there. Yes, there was lots of silly music and bad hair, but who needs to hear about it every other paragraph? Markham does best with plotting and a depiction of suburban motherhood that really rings true. And I really didn't know which Mike our gal would end up with. Not bad Wendy, just lose the gimmicks and romance-novel heroine next time."
4,Fun read,"I am probably around the same age as the author, because all the 80's references had me laughing. Also, being married 15 years myself, sometimes you DO imagine what might have been. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to this enjoyable story."
4,Could be better,"I'm glad I bought this book, but I felt that the authors could have followed through on the premise a bit more. Some brainstorming or a visit to the TV tropes web site will turn up any number of elements that could have been included, but weren't. For instance, the phenomenon of laser beams coming out of regular guns in 80s cartoons is never mentioned. There could be some sort of ""stock footage"" special moves (i.e. ""Form blazing sword!"") and an incentive for players to use them. I liked the book enough to buy it twice when I lost my original copy, though."
4,"Beautifully acted, but very dark story","The acting is superb in this very dark, intriguing adaptation of Oscar Wilde's book, The Picture of Dorian Gray. I thought the actor who played Dorian Gray did an excellent job and had the right balance of innocence and self-absorbed tendencies. I could not watch this movie repeatedly because the plot is depressing and dark, but I think that is typical of Wilde. It's worth viewing, but beware that it is not a sunny, light romantic story, but rather a serious look into what happens to a man's soul when he thinks only of himself and his pleasure."
4,Dorian Gray,"Good movie, I have the older version of this movie, and this one has a different tone to it than the older one does, but it's a good movie. I still think the portrait could've look more gruesome though."
1,Odd couple book,This book was not an enjoyable read for me at all. It told me nothing new that I have not heard in other interviews on tv talk shows with the people involved. While the book was able to express to the reader that the author is a fan of the show it failed to raise your knowledge of how the show operated behind the scenes. It just sounds like one big fan letter. If you are like me and collect books about how your favorite shows were created then buy this one only because it is the only one I have found about the Odd Couple tv series. Other wise I can't recommend this book.
4,Nostalgia trip,"My purchase of this was strictly a nostalgia trip for an old man of 73. This cartoon is a cut above much of the current stuff in my opinion. And I still get a kick out of the evil (not very) magician as voiced by Billy De Wolfe. Plus, in the added features there's an interesting discussion by Arthur Rankin about the style of the cartoon, as opposed to, say, Disney's style."
5,"Superb, Frosty!","""Frosty the Snowman"" ranks up there with ""Rudolph"". Both of them are repeatedly shown every Christmas. That's a good thing! There's alway something decent on TV at around Christmastime. The classic song is a holiady cartoon narrated by Jimmy Durante. It's something every child should see at Christmas. Merry Christmas!"
1,Oh Dear,"Oh Dear,What will she release next year??? A country Album? Will she be Bad girl gone Good??? She has to strip and change her style(if she has one) to keep the public interested...She is an image created to be so popular, but her album isnt selling as good as they are making us think, for an artist that has been on the charts for 9/wo week, her album hasn't even gone gold yet, but Maroon 5, Pink with U & ur hand, Justin Timberlake with Summer Love which didn't even go to #1 on Billboard have all gone gold??? I dunno I think it is like One person buying or downloading a song/album a million times so people will think everyone is buying it and then they start to buy it too...An image created because talent & this girl don't go together... If not 4 Jay pushing her with those endorsement deals, she wud be forgotten like that Tierra Marie. But if i was her i wouldn't feel too bad, at least u never took ur clothes off to sell an album, keep flippin those burgers girl ;-)..."
3,Sent the wrong CD,"You sent ""A girl like me""not ""reloaded""I see you sent it from Argentina- It's not a big enough deal to send it back to you and have you and me pay extra shipping-Kelly"
5,Excellent timing!,"Hey ""V""Thank you so much for being so thougtful and quick on sending my CD. I am very impressed with you and the whole AMAZON family. Not even E-Bay can compare to you when it comes to receiving ordered merchandise.I truly appreciated your service. Thanks again, ""L"""
3,A few good tracks.,"There's only a few quality tracks on this album, so I wish I'd just bought single CDs, instead of the whole album."
3,if you stop the music....,"there are some pretty cool songs on here, like don't stop the music and shut up and drive and of course umbrella!! Its not great though...."
5,A+,Rihanna is an amazing artist. Her lyrics and singing are simply unique and incredible. I really enjoy her upbeat music.
4,Good Girl Gone Bad Review,"""Good Girl Gone Bad"" is a good album. I feel Rihanna has taken her music to a new level and it really shows in her music. If she keeps this up she'll go a long way. I recommend this album to anyone who is a Rihanna fan or people who appreciate her music."
4,Great Album.,I love this album. Price was good. My only issue is no where did I see it say edited and it is :(
4,SHE HAS FINALLY DONE IT!,"Rihanna was one of those artists that created killer singles, but terrible albums. ""Music of the Sun"" and ""A Girl Like Me"" created some of the greatest summer singles of the 21st century, but the albums as a whole failed to impress. They were mediocre at best. But on this stunning album, Rihanna finally created what she has been trying to do for the past three years. She finally made an album where almost all the tracks are good! The song with Ne-Yo and the track, ""Say It"" could be replaced with the bonus tracks, ""Cry"" and ""Haunted"", but otherwise the album is great! Another problem is that the album isn't the standard size of a regular jewel case. So it will not fit in a CD rack. But overall, a really club-ready album that could get me on the dancefloor from start to finish."
4,Good CD,"Like this album alot! Rihanna is awesome anyway, but it's good to workout and clean to, gets you amped up! Good Job Rihanna!"
4,T Touch,"This book has great pictures and easy to follow dialogue that explains the T Touch technique , the reason to use it and what you can expect from it. I found it easy to follow and useful for my dogs.Getting in TTouch with Your Dog: An Easy, Gentle Way to Better Health and Behavior"
5,Great Gift for Grandparents,"This was a terrific video, and I loved that it was hosted by Maya Angelou. It was helpful for both me and my parents to learn how grandparents can stay involved in the livesof their grandchildren, whether grandparenting from nearbyor far away. The video stresses the importance of this relationship and does a good job of recognizing differenttypes of families structures and cultural diversity. I thinkit would be a great gift for new grandparents, grandparents-to-be or even for expectant parents to buy for their parents!"
2,Every mid-tempo piano crooner should fear becoming David Yazbek,"I'd going to go out on a limb and say his kitschy showtunes are actually much better than his solo work, where he thinks he's Randy Newman. On that note, listen to Sail Away."
4,No Game with Bundle,It's not really a bundle when it doesn't come with the game. I was kinda dissapointed when the game wasn't in the package. Need to provide a better description of product...one that's not so decieving.
2,Not worth upgrading,I upgraded from ULead's VideoStudio 8.0 to 11 Plus. The installation didn't work as directed and their helpline was not helpful. They blamed it on the camera driver not being one they supported even though it is a relatively new Sony camcorder. So I'm back to using my old 8.0 for capturing video (or one of the many programs that came on my PC) and 11 Plus for editing. Not exactly ideal.
5,Corel Ulead VideoStudio 11 Plus is great.,"I've tried several video editing softwares and VS 11 Plus tops them all.Easy install, and following the steps easy to use.I'v e already produced my first movie and burned to dvd.I recommend this product...just make sure your computer has the power and proper specs with a large hard drive(I'm going to purchase an external drive, around 500 Gigs or more in the future)."
3,Users guide and help screens,"Be prepared to spend lots of frustrating time experimenting with the many cryptic icon buttons and settings to find out what they do, as the ""manual"", the terminology used, and the help screens are not very helpful at all, especially to a newbie. The learning curve is very steep."
3,It does have the basic grammar.,"I was satisfied with both VHS tapes as a grammar overview of Italian, but anyone wanting to ""learn Italian"" from them is bound to be disappointed. This was a review course only. Both tapes 1 and 2 were fast-paced run-throughs of the basics of counting, days and months, and the rules of grammar, construction, conjugation and word agreement. They teach very little actual Italian conversation. The viewer will see and hear less than 30 simple sentences on both tapes combined, and they are only used to illustrate a quickly stated rule of the language. Again, these tapes are a valuable review of the rules for already-established students of the language. They are not for teaching the language. It's too bad someone can't come up with a 20-volume set that would teach Italian from simple to complex, like the PBS French (Carpetz) tapes do so well."
3,Good materials. Not the best design.,"Everything seems well-made in terms of the construction--sturdy enough. But there is a bit of oversight in the functionality of its design.I wanted a headrest mount that would facilitate easy placement and removal of my Archos player in the car. Who wants to leave their $550+ player in their car? When you put the player in this mount and attach it to the headrest the top cover flap is sandwiched between the mount and the headrest...the only way to open the top is to remove the player to undo the straps that hold it to the headrest. This is a major operation that I don't want to perform everytime I leave my car. To work around this, I leave the top flap unclosed sticking up which is not ideal but is the lesser of two evils.This is the only product out there for this so what is one to do?"
3,it's ok,"It's ok. I have a economical APT style small gas stove, in a small kitchen, in a small studio. So, space is precious & valuable. I did gain extra counter space as it described.I thought I was going to receive 2 tiles; I guess I read it wrongly.~K"
3,not very soft,"the shirt was not very soft like those thin organic shirts...the sizing was kind of weird, it was wider and shorter than normal."
5,Santa Claus is coming to town,"This DVD was exactly as described.beautiful shape, works great so Igive this A+A+A+A+A+"
2,It's in Spanish,"The people at Amazon don't make it obvious that this DVD is in Spanish and is only available in Spanish. If one doesn't speak Spanish, it isn't possible to watch. I returned it TWICE because Amazon was unaware of their own product."
3,No bonus songs please!,"Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town is such a great classic so why would Sony put a stupid Mariah Carey video on there, that crap DOES NOT belong on a Christmas classic like this. Once again, thanks Sony for yet ruining another classic just like you ruined the Rudolf DVD with that Destiny's Child garbage!"
5,Wonderful,"This is a special, touching Christmas video. Wonderful for the kids and to add to your Christmas collection"
5,MY GRANDSON'S FAVORITE,I ordered this video because this Christmas special accidentally was erased from our DVR. He is only 20 months and requests it daily. I was very happy when I found that it was available from Amazon at such a reasonable price. The shipping was prompt and the quality of the video was excellent.
4,Happy Holidays is biased and uneven in its coverage,"Although I generally love Elmo's World DVDs, I found the bias in this one troubling. Why is Kelly Ripa telling people about Kwanzaa? Shouldn't a black host be informing kids about this holiday? Kelly says she has never been to Africa. Well that's helpful. And then we get Kelly's take on Hanukkah, which also seems off. Really, she shouldn't be talking about either holiday.Don't be fooled, this one's about Christianity and Christmas. This may seem extreme, but I really feel the subtext of this video is ""if you aren't Christian, you are second class and you get a second class holiday."" I expect more from these Sesame St videos, because so many supposedly intelligent people are supposed to be involved in making and approving them."
5,Excellent concert,Excellent concert and recording.But if you can only watch one song make sure it is Blue Veins. i think Jimmy and Robert would approve
4,It arrived looking healthy with lemons on it!,"I was impressed at the packaging it arrived in. It was healthy and is really doing well. There were some small lemons already on it and they are doing well. I thought it was a little pricey and have seen better prices since, but overall, I'm very pleased."
3,"Good album, too pop sounding sometimes","While I commend Faith Hill for doing Cry in 2002, and it is good, the album's a little too pop-heavy at times, not as much Nashville country as one might expect. I like the title song, Free, One (and its hip-hop driven bass lines on it), You're Still Here and some others. But the second half sounds like too many 1987-sounding heavy metal songs and power ballads mixed up in a blender before track 14. Bon Jovi and Whitesnake could have sang with Faith on those songs the way they sound. It does have a loudness that could match perfectly with the summer tour she's doing now (2006) with Tim McGraw. It's not as groundbreaking as Faith or the hits-heavy Breathe. But I doubt if anyone is playing this CD in their car now on the streets of Nashville. They might eject the CD and later toss it off in the street, because it's way too slick at times."
3,More POP than Country,This Album is more a pop album than a country album.With this Faith Hill as drop a little points in my conceit.
5,Shining Faith,"Faith's new album, ""CRY"" is an absolutely incredible cd! While there is much debate over her 'crossover' style on this album, I think that she delivers an amazing performance. It is always good when artists try new things, and Faith's true talent really shines on this record!"
1,You Will Cry just A Lot,"Now i'm not one of these people who roam around rubbishing everything but i call a spade a spade when i see one. I have enjoyed all of Faith's Previos work from TMAIA to Breathe. But this has got to be one of the worst releases this year. It seems as if she is more interested on how she looks on the cover than whats on the CD. None of these tracks are enjoyable to listen to and they are all over produced. Im not sure what faith is trying to be? but it seems like those who are guiding her career want to turn her into a mariah carey/britney and Celine wannabe. If that was thier intention there sure have suceeded because the music in this CD is just as shallow as the music in those ""artists"" that i have mentioned."
2,Not UP!!,"I was disappointed in this album. I like Faith's singing, but this album is a downer -- you can tell by the title!I much preferred Shania Twain's new album -- happier, catchier songs. I also preferred Faith's earlier albums to this one.It's not country, not rock either. I wish I hadn't bought it."
5,"Not country, but another fantastic album!","Faith Hill is probably going to get a lot of bad reviews for not making a 'country' album. Her voice, though, is not just a country voice. She can sing anything, and she proves it on Cry. The album is much more soulful than anything else, but the album is still fantastic. The songs make you want to smile, make you want to cry, make you want to get up and dance. The album makes you want to feel emotions and think. I think, by far, this is her best album, and probably one of the best albums of 2002, country or not."
2,Disappointed Fan,Faith's latest album does not do her talent justice. I bought this CD because I'm a fan of her music in the past - but what a disappointment this album turned out to be. It's not even worth downloading from the internet!
1,Murder on Music Row,"What can I say, this cd Sucks! When Faith started to go pop and Fans expressed their unapproving opinions, Faith didn't listen! She started out with great potential, named as the next Tammy Wynette. What happened? Many more Albums like this and it wouldn't surprise me if I read in Country Weekely that she had been dropped from her music label. Don't go out and buy this cd! Go to Applebee's and buy a steak dinner, it will be much more satisfying and won't leave you naucious."
2,Good start but....,"I am a big Faith Hill fan but...this album doesn't do her voice justice. It's not Faith but whoever picked this material. The first three tunes are wonderful. They show off her great pipes but what chart are they from..country, pop, r&b, hip-hop??? This album has no identity. Producing an album is more than just picking 14 songs and going into the studio. Even with outstanding musicians and a fabulous singer, bad materials comes off bad. Listen to the first three tracks, then turn on the radio. Better luck next time, Faith."
1,"If I Wanted A Celine Dion Album, I Would Have Bought One","Whomever directed Faith to turn her back on Country Music for this album really did her, and her long time fans, a disservice. With the exception of the single 'Cry,' and the song, 'This Is Me' the rest of the album is unnotable, except in its attempts to mimic the Celine Dion/Whitney Houston/Brittney Spears sound.Faith Hill was one of the artists whom I could go out the day her album was released and buy a copy, unheard, and know that I would like the entire thing. Well, I won't make that mistake again.Hopefully, like her husband has done with his upcoming album after the psuedo-country ""Set This Circus Down,"" Faith's next offering will bring her back to her country roots and we'll be off this ""Who Wants to Be A Pop Diva"" train."
2,Whatever happened to country singers singing COUNTRY?,"I've always loved Faith Hill. I've been buying her albums religiously long before her sex symbol/crossover status in the music world. I had really anticipated this album after first hearing ""Cry"" on the radio.. but was sorely disappointed after bringing the whole CD home today. It's just not country enough for me. If I wanted to listen to pop music, I'd buy Britney's albums. To sum it up in just a few words.. download it first! I NEVER buy CD's and only gave in this time because it was Faith. I'll be a little more careful next time."
3,I Cried at how bland this was.,"I love Faith Hill, but a full blown pop record? Why? Who told her to do this? I can't even remember have of the tracks when its done spinning. I dont think i want to. It sounds good, but its all kind of wallpaper that fell off. I hope this is just one stumble, and not a complete fall."
3,"Not the best, but not bad either","When I first got this album, I was alittle surprise of how much different this album was from her others. I wasn't too crazy about it at first. Yes, it don't sound country at all. But really to me, it don't matter if its country, pop, whatever... good music is just that, good music! So its not because it wasn't country. Faith has done much better then this album. But after listening to this album some more, I've got to where I like it more. But I'm still not crazy about this album. There are some good songs, but not the best. Some of the good ones are ""Free"", ""Cry"", ""Beautiful"", and ""This Is Me"". One song that I didn't like at first but grew on me later is, ""One"". The songs on here are just so different for Faith. I think if she wanted different, she could of picked a better choice of music. So if you do purchase this album, I would say to listen to it more before you trash it. It grew on me over time. I just wouldn't say that this is Faith Hill's best album=o)"
1,Just a response,"I very rarely write reviews, but I looked over a few on here and realized I had to chime in. I believe Faith Hill is one of the most brilliant country artists to come down the bin. Take Me As I Am, It Matters To Me, and Faith were masterpieces of interpretation, vocal prowess, fully developed albums. Faith Hill as an artist however began to go astray on Breathe. Breathe was an album of phenomonal moments spread out over mediocrity. With Cry, Faith Hill's search for new audience completely led her astray. ""Cry"" and ""When The Lights Go Down"" are the only even vaguely listenable tracks. The rest of the album is a mish-mash of pop-wanna-be songs that don't even begin to live up to the potential of the artists. Sometimes fans become blinded by loyalty to an artists, and I don't believe it is fair to people to buy an album based on those opinions."
5,She's a babe's babe!,"I haven't heard this CD, nor do I know any of her works. But just based on her looks alone, I rate this CD a 5! I'm sure Beethoven when he was deaf, would do so too!"
2,what is she thinking,ok i was so happy when i got this cd i put it on in it sucks the only singer that can make country sound good with pop/rock is shania twain . faith hill is better of singing country if i was u dont buy this cd cuz u wont be happy with it
1,Paper thin Artist,"I never quite got all the Love that Faith Hill has gotten over the years&still don't.I felt from the first time I heard ""this Kiss"" through Now that She was a Lucky 2nd-Tier Act who got over in a very Watered Down time in Music&after hearing this Album I feel right on the mark.She has a Decent Voice but Not Worthy of Being Called A Diva or Somehow that Merits the Kind of Hype She is Getting with each Album.Boring!!"
3,"""I gave now I'm wanting something in return...""","Faith Hill's Cry isn't a deep or catchy album but it is probably Faith's finest hour. There are more pop songs on Cry, some work and some don't. Unfortanely, the songs Faith chooses to sing aren't that profound, just your basic run-of-the-mill love songs. The plus with this album is that Faith's voice has vastly improved and she sounds better than ever! The best track on the disc is When the Lights go Down, this song is the most serious and her best recorded song so far. The title-track is rich and beautiful and cuts right to the bone. If You're Gonna Fly Away is a throw-away track from Pink, yes Pink! but this song works for Faith and she shines on this poppy track. The rest of the songs are so-so and the rest are forgettable. Cry is a mixed bag but there is no denying Faith's growth as a producer and singer."
4,A New Faith,"Faith Hill's newest album breaks some new ground for her. It is much different than her last effort, much more slick and polished (maybe too much?), more adult contemporary/pop than country. She seems to be trying out several different musical styles on the same CD, maybe not sure what she is best at. What is right with this CD: her likeable, strong voice; her ability to convey emotion, especially on some of the gospel oriented tunes (mate Tim McGraw is very good at this too); the variety of songs. What is wrong: the producer made it a little to polished--is Faith having fun (example: easy to hear on the new Dixie Chick's CD Home) or is she working?; again, the producer layered so many sounds (drum machines, synths, bass) that at times it is hard to pick out Faith's voice from all the mess; maybe too much variety in song style. Next time, Faith, let them bring your fine voice to the front of the songs."
2,profiling this album,"it seems to me that my previous review of this album was correct. winning her awards only solidifies what i said about her change over to more of a pop sound. its always good for an artist to explore other things. faith's roots are and always be in country music, but it was a refreshing change to show her abilities."
5,Very pleased!,"I had been in a serious car accident in January of this year, my car was totaled with my Faith Hill CD ""Cry"" jammed in the player. I searched all over town to no avail and was very happy to locate it at massbookstore on Amazon.com. The price was excellant and it arrived in a week. Thank you Amazon!!"
3,"Not country, country","""Cry"" is a good album, but not country. It is slightly over enhanced with a ""produced in the studio"" sound. Faith sounds as if she is shouting on ""Cry"" rather than actually singing. The song selection is great with well written ballads. Faith stays within her range on ""This is Me"" and doesn't over-sing. If you love Faith you will love this record. Looking for great country, pass it by."
2,A Fish Out of Water,"Cry makes me want to do just that ... it's a pity Faith's abandoned what works in search of something that just doesn't exist, at least not on this album. The only thing more patetic that this attempt to ""cross-over"" into pop divadom is Faith's ""Cry"" video. Faith, honey, not all the black eye make-up in the world will gain you entrance into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ... let's fire a few producers and get back to what works."
1,Pure Pop for Dull People,"What is contained on this CD isn't country music. Let's get that straight. What is contained on this CD is mere product. A formuled sound designed to win the favor of corporate radio programers only interested in winning the latest Arbitron book by catering only to the lowest common denominator.If you want to hear the real deal, shut off that radio and take a chance on some Kitty Wells, Johnny Cash, or a slew of other younger artists who are more interested in making decent and authentic music and not just in making enough dough to drive fancy cars and live an opulent lifestyle. This is nothing but marketing and it has NOTHING to do with music, especially country music."
4,Spiritual Geography,"Yes, this book is about the Dakota and what it is like to live there but what I appreciated most about the book was the spiritual journey the isolation of living in this remote area promoted. The quiet spaces of living in such a desolate region helped the author discover things about herself and about her spirituality she could not access in a busier place with more distractions. This speaks to me of the necessity of finding a quiet place to ""be alone with the Alone"" no matter where you may find yourself"
5,The best jesus music an atheist can listen to,"Rise and shine is as good as any bible music I have ever heard except mahalia jackson , maybe. I am atheist, but my love of music trumps religion in this CD. At one time I didn't even like country, but Randy Travis has ""the Voice"", I won't go into his personal life, but this Bible CD, is very good, every song has a good story, none are poorly done. I would think ""Three wooden crosses "" is the highpoint of the CD, the story has been told for eons, probly since the ancient greek days, for sure Shakespear had to have something compareable. It is my second copy, the first I gave away to a hurricane Katrina victim. Give it a try."
2,So-so so far!,The dermatologists office recomended this product with rave reviews. I've been using it faithfully for 6 weeks. Frankly I've noticed little change in the scars appearance. Perhaps it just takes longer. The product itself is fine. Easy to use and takes make up nicely. A little pricey for silicon!
2,Kelo-cote,"I used Kelo-cote under dermatologist's prescription for different scars for 1 year. In two 20 year old surgery scars (shoulder and stomach): kelo-cote only cleared skin color, now is back to same color, so no improvement at all. In new scar, no improvent at all, only relieved itching and pain in scar. Last injury in skin as result of a mole fulguration Kelo-cote prevented scar. Seems like kelo-cote is useless for old scars, and maybe there is a chance it only works to prevent new and small superficial scars."
1,Sticky gel never dries or absorbs into skin,"I generally like silicone scar removers, but this one is sticky and does not dry like it says it will. It remains very sticky on the skin. I did not continue to use it due to this. I used another brand that was a thinner consistency and absorbed in very well called ScarAway which I was very happy with."
5,ScarGel,"I had extensive plastic surgery and was very concerned because I have a tendency to form keloids. The surgeon in Brasil recommended Kelo-Cote, so when I returned home, I purchased three tubes. They were a bit expensive, but I decided if it worked, it was worth the price. Not only have my new scars flattened out and healed nicely, but my old scars have benefited from daily applications. I was also impressed at how little product is needed to make a difference. I have already recommended your product to several friends AND have leftovers for when future scarring!!! Many thanks for a great product."
1,Remains Sticky on top of skin- never dries as it says it does,"Sorry to report I was not happy with this gel. It stayed sticky and wet/thick on the skin and therefore made it impossible to use. It says it dries in a layer on teh skin, but even blowing on it and leaving it exposed for over an hour it never dried.I switched to the Scar Away serum which worked much better for me."
2,doesnt work,I dont think this does anything but act as a glorified barrier cream... I didn't notice any improvement in any of my scars.
1,buy the tapes,"these DVDs are basically twice as much as the tapes and have absolutely NO extras. i love pokémon and these episodes are really great, but just buy the tapes. then you'll have more money left over to buy toys. (:"
3,3 stars,"It's interesting, and the actors are very good. But It doesn't have subtitles and this is a big problem a"
5,Slight Correction of Lawrance M. Bernabo's Review,"I have little to add...except to note that this work is NOT completely original, but IS based on the book ""Lt. Hornblower"" by C.S. Forester. Like all of the AEA Hornblower series, it does not follow the storyline in the books exactly. In my opinion, this one deviates more than the others from the original story. In the book for example, Hornblower does not stand trial...After you watch these excellent DVDs, go read the books!"
5,Not From the Books!,"This is an original story written just for A&E and should be taken as a bridge to the next films that are being planned for next year.This film serves to answer questions not answered in the books: whatever happened to Archie? What happened to Captain Pelew?Don't be alarmed, though -- the Forester estate gave approval and oversaw the story construction.After sharing these films with your kids...be sure you share the books as well. Your entirely family will enjoy the films and learn a great deal about British Navel History.Enjoy!"
5,Cute and Inspiring!,I loved it and so did my students! I am in love with this author/illustrator pair! The stories leave you with a happy heart and the illustrations are too adorable :)
3,Letterboxed,"This is not true 1.78:1 aspect ratio. The video is letterboxed, which means it will not display across the entire screen on some systems set up for pure digital video (i.e. using a HDMI cable)."
5,"Wow - Refreshing, Authentic, Deep Wisdom!","Walter Starcke takes the veil off and shares directly what it means to be on the spiritual path of ascension. He clearly shows the real meaning behind Jesus' life and words - showing us that he was the example of what is available to all of us. We are God - It's All God... Wow as we realize this the world around us will change.. well it is changing actually - already. In any event, this book is a gem in the world of spiritual texts. If you are on the path of the mystics - it should not be missed. If you are miffed by the current outdated structures of traditional churches - Starcke provides a refreshing outlet that allows in what you already know and allows you to deepen your understanding of Christ's teachings. We are all here to find the Christ within us and let it out! Thank you Walter Starcke for your rawness, your authenticity and your honesty."
2,Zipper broke,"This lasted for awhile, but not too long ago, the zipper broke and it doesn't really keep things too cold in hot weather."
4,Heather Whitestone,"As a relatively new Miss America junkie, I am reading a lot on this topic. I was fortunate enough to see Heather dance at Miss A, and met her last year at a conference where she was the keynote speaker. I found her to be very passionate about her beliefs and faith in God and family, and a truly delightful person. Although this book is not always smooth reading, it is truly a description about living with, loving, and supporting your child who developed a disability. I found it a good read, and have shared it with my friends."
3,Nice but with issues,"Love the looks of it, however, after 4 yrs of use, substantial delamination of the wood handles has occurred and I'm unsure we can repair it. The swing was set up in a covered area. The delamination, I assume, is from humidity in the air. (We store it in the garage in the winter).The swing is not particularly comfortable. The wooden front bar is especially uncomfortable on the legs if you swing with your feet elevated/dangling. There is a lump in the middle which prevents making this a 2adult/child swing. It's strictly 1 or 2 person.The roping has molded a bit. We sprayed the rope with a mild clorox/water blend and it seems to have helped.I feel like the swing needs a cushion for better comfort, which sort of defeats the whole ""hammock"" feel."
3,Old formula better,"This new formula without that little bit of caffeine doesn't work as well for me as the old formula with caffeine did. I am still congested, still have sinus headaches. I can get the old formula tablets from the nurse at work but I can't get them when I order the Mygrex online, not from Amazon and not from the pharmaceutical company. But the company's nurse can. Go figure. I won't be ordering this product again."
1,"Cute bag, poor quality and inefficient design","I agree with everyone else who gave this 1 star. My son is almost 6 months old and I have rarely used this bag, yet, the bag is totally torn at the zipper of the main compartment. The smaller pockets don't really hold anything so that is a complete waste. I can barely fit a receiving blanket, a change of clothes, diapers, travel wipes, a bottle and a nursing cover at the same time. If I do the bag is stretched to the limit. Which, is probably why the bag tore in the first place. I still have to bring a purse with me because there is just no way I could squeeze my wallet and necessary purse items into the bag along with the baby stuff. The changing pad is great, but you can buy those anywhere. I have emailed JJ Cole about the rip so we'll see what they do (if anything) for me. But I'm buying a new bag. Don't waste your money."
2,Screamingly bad,"This sequel is worth watching only for Shakespearean-trained (and Mausoleum-voiced) William Marshall and surprisingly not for Blacksploitation queen Pam Grier, whose effort here ranks among her worst. Worse even thanSheba, Baby, which is saying either quite a lot or nothing at all. The final séance is well-paced but the rest of the film is truly poor: not scary and not very funny, either. The supporting case is as supportive as month-old lettuce. I still have high hopes for 1972's originalBlaculabecause I adore this genre. (I recently reviewed more than a dozen early-Seventies Blacksploitation flicks.) But Scream, Blacula, Scream was an atrocious film, even by period standards. I would not recommend it, and I will never watch it again."
4,Love this 1973 movie--William Marshall does Mamawalde,"Black master actor William Marshall is arguably over-qualified to play Blacula. Blacula is/was the vampire alter-ego of African Prince ""Mamawalde"". This was a sequel to ""Blacula"", which was released in 1972. While not ""great art"", these black exploitation ""descendants"" of the old Universal Dracula movies are quite enjoyable, forty years after their theatrical release and on DVD.The cars, music and dress bring back such memories!"
4,Will not fit Delta Contractor Saw II,"Purchased this to replace my trusted 14 year-old SD508 set. Based on the other reviews here, I carefully checked whether the arbor on my Delta Contractor II saw would be long enough before using it. Sadly, it is not. I never have needed to cut a dado wider than 3/4"", but the arbor nut will not engage with the A,D,D,D,D,B combo installed (nominal 3/4""). I can't really fault the blade set, since it's hard to imagine how they could make the dial much thinner and the basic blade design is very similar to my current one. Alas, I'll have to continue to use shims with my SD508 and start saving for that Unisaw!"
2,Kind of bored me to be honest :(,"I really wanted to love this book like previous reviewers seemed to, but I can't.I've spent A LOT of time on NYC's subway trains headed to all different places at all hours of the day/night, but this somewhat small book of black & white photos just does NOT bring to life the average experience.I get that this is supposed to be artistic and ethereal, however--no offense to the photographer--to me it just looks like page after page of ""dash-n-run"" photos done by an amateur. I mean there's one photo that spans two pages and it's nothing but streaks of light & a complete BLUR. It's honestly a blur...you have no idea what the photo is OF/what you're looking at.I relied solely on reviews before ordering this book, but simply can't agree with the others. There are endless books on NYC subway photography. Most any of them have to be better than this one. Especially those that are in COLOR!"
2,Outdated and bland,There is a whole lot more on the internet w/free searches. This was not of much help at all. I would recommend using any search engine to get you in the right direction.
1,Psychic Scum Go Home,"Poor baby Genesis P-Orridge. Does anyone even care about his oversized ego and what he claims to have achieved in his pathetic life ? If only he had something to say instead of repeating himself over and over again, Nothing of importance. In this book you won't read about his assaults on women and men who managed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, nor will you learn about how he committed perjury to make money from a lawsuit with record producer Rick Rubin. Nope, non of that in here because Gen thinks everything he does is ""perfect"". Now that he's devolved into a wifeless, overbreasted, drugged out, self indulgent, pathetic name dropper most people with half a brain can see through this idiot. Let's take up a collection for him, maybe he'll buy some rope and hang himself finally."
1,DOESN'T QUITE CUT IT !,"I rented the movie Cut at my local Blockbuster not expecting much at all,but I thought the movie would be watchable at least,it wasn't. First off the movie starts out the same way as Scream ,something left on the stove and a killer calling the house saying ""now you die"" and then appearing in the house next with ubber garden sheers. Later we learn that this is a movie that is being made and the director gets killed,then years later the same actors try to finish the film. An interesting story but very poorly acted and executed. With little lack of originality or flare that makes this movie sink just like most teeny horror films these days(Scream,I Know What You Did,Valentine,Urban Legend,Soul Survivors etc...)and in addition the accents sometimes are hard to follow and pretty amatuer acting. I CAN'T SAY I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS"
5,cut!,"never heard of this movie before until i decided to check it out. give it 5 stars for the entertainment value alone. awesome flick. bad guy reminds me somewhat of freddie krueger, looks wise that is. think the plot is that someone started a horror movie and they never finished it so a group of kids from school decide to finish the film and while doing that they bring back the bad guy from the film or somethin like that. either way this movie is a must see. make sure you check this one out. will be very surprised how good it is"
5,Worked out well for me,"Needed long cable for watching DVR on TV in a second room. Works just fine. Nice cable, at a reasonable price."
3,Typo Heaven,"An interesting book for the semi-advanced player is destroyed by typo after typo, a fault that ultimately drives the reader mad. What's going on in the publishing world?"
3,It's Alright,"It is very user friendly, and the cover sheets provided prints out with bright and vibrant pictures.DVD/CD covers I am very disappointed in.1) The prints come out dull and faded.2) The adhesive does not stick very well. After one use in the DVD/Blue Ray player the ends start to unstick and the DVD begins to skip (I assume due to the heat from the player). I got some glue stick to fix the problem.Overall it is okay. If you purchase I recommend getting a tube of glue stick. You'll need it."
1,Caution 5/10 Maker Is Good (ONLY),"Product is mislabeled. The product all works perfectly. I have no problems with that.When I purchased I thought I was getting 128 CD Labels. However it IS NOT 138 CD Labels.You Get: 30 CD Labels - 30 Multiple Use Labels - 30 Jewel Case Spines - 30 Mini CD Label.That is 120 total mix, not CD Labels. They do not even total 138."
2,Would not recomend.,"Hardware is O.K. The software is a disaster!138 labels? that means all the jewel cover front, rear and spine labels. I think I got 20 actual dvd labels and after dealing with the software 10 were usable. Seriously, I just ordered some generic labels and am going the photo shop route. I would think Memorex could design some more user friendly or at least usable software but perhaps I was wrong."
3,Decent not great,"I used this product to label around 10 cd's a week. it does the job ok but you have to be careful to line up the cd in the labeler. If you just drop the CD on it, the center pin is just a shade to small to line it up automatically so you have to carefully position the cd so the label doesn't hang over the edge. That being said, it works for the most part so it is decent."
1,DVD labels limited to tiny center label,"I bought this at a retail store (not Amazon) looking for something to print labels for DVDs.On the front packaging it says ""CD & DVD"" and ""Design great looking CDS & DVDS"" in legible text. Also on the back it states in legible text the package includes ""5 DVD labels"".What I didn't notice until I got it home is the extremely small print on the back (so small I had to use a magnifying glass to read it):""Warning: Using a standard or full-face label on DVDs may result in the disc becoming unreadable. To reduce the risk of lost data, use the center only label for all DVDs.""So if your objective is DVD labels, be warned that the $20 buys you only a tiny label in the center of the DVD."
2,I must say I was disappointed,"in this product. There were 2 walnut blocks about 2""x3""x4"" and about 20+ ""sheets"" of 3""x6""x 1/32"". I have no idea what I'm going to use those really thin strips for. They are really too thin to even use for miter joint keys without stacking at least 2 together. Won't fall for it again. If you want hobby wood, go to Rockler and order a bag of their cutoffs. I've gotten a couple so far and there is way more useful wood included."
2,Get what you pay for,"It only lasted 6 months ...the rewind/forward/record all stopped working .. changed tapes, batteries just doesn't want to spin . I expected it to last longer than 6 months..very disappointing"
3,Weak,"I had to tape the ""play/pause"" switch down. It's still just mediocre. Sometimes the tapes I record are blank. Volume is low. So So for $30"
2,Poor quality,"I purchased this product for use in an office. Half way through the tapes, the tape would slow down so extensively that my voice was distorted and you could not understand what was being dictated. Very poor quality."
2,cheap,"when putting the blank micro-cassette in the window popped off, the stop button broke ,the writting on the side that tells you the funtions are written so small you need better then 20/20 eyesight to see the words"
2,Not Joe Queenan's best work,"I loved Joe Queenan's ""If You Are Talking to Me your Career Must be in Trouble"" and have sought out everything else he has written since reading that hilarious book several years ago. This book is a disappointment. Part of the problem is that when put together, you realize that a lot of his essays consist either of: (a) the juxtaposition of movies with similar story lines to illustrate the point that Hollywood movies are formulaic (shocking revelation; its amusing the first time he does it, but wears thin after a while); or (b) attempting to do replicate feats in movies in real life to illustrate the concept that Hollywood movies are unrealistic (another shocking revleation; this wasn't funny to me even the first time). The essay which involved him acting like a jerk in movie theatres just didn't work for me either. Still has a few chuckles in it and good observations on movies. The piece about nun movies is quite amusing."
5,To an Outsider...,"This book was extremely helpful in finding out exactly what the Course is all about.When someone asked me last week what I thought of ""A Course in Miracles"", I realzied that although I had heard the name for years I knew *nothing* of what it was, where it came from, or what it taught.Mr. Miller's book did a good job of explaining what the Course is, and the gist of it's message. In the course of this, he convinced me that Helen Schuckman had a genuine spiritual experience -- something I was prepared to doubt, before.I am not a ""seeker"" -- I have an active & fulfilling spiritual life, that does not include the Course. And I have neither the time nor desire to read The Course as a primary text, simply to learn *about* it.Because of this, I found Mr. Miller's book invaluable."
5,Well Worth the Price,"For the price, these are a great set of speakers. Only drawback--the wires are a bit too short if you really want to spread them around a room. The sound is really respectable. I think Logitech has wireless speakers now, but you're going to PAY for them. These can still be found online for under $60."
2,broken ?,"both the volume and bass controls on the remote arent working like they seem they should. At a quarter turn on both knobs might as well be all the way down.. At half turn is when the bass kicks in louder than youd prefer... This leaves the system with no range of bass control, its either tons of bass or no bass at all.. volume has same effect but is easier to manage by manipulating the computers output volume... i wouldnt buy this system again for its problem but i must admit quality of the product does seem very good like other logitech products.I probly just got one of the first 100 produced."
3,Okay Speakers,I bought these speakers last week new. They are okay for a PC/laptop but not considered too good for surround sound on a tv set. The smaller speakers rattled and sound a little discontorted but that might change once I get the chance to hang them up on the wall. If you are looking for better surround sound for gaming/tv buy the more expensive $300 ones Logitech has. However if due to budgetary reasons you want good ones these are ok.
3,"Discribed to be like new, but NOT","this were more than used, nothing ""like new"" about these speakers. I should have added the extra 10 bucks and bought them new."
1,Why bother?,"With shipping and handling this is over 100.00$'s. When you can go to logitech's website or on newegg and buy their latest one for less? So come on this is a rip, the shipping isn't even included. This isn't even a decent deal."
3,Decent but not great,"For the price this speaker set is worth it, but having experienced a Z-5500 set, this set is easily blown away by it. But then again the Z-5500 is nearly 5x the price so i guess you cant really compare them. The bass isn't too clear and the rear speaker cables are a bit short. Other than that I'd recommend these as a starter 5.1 speaker set."
1,Don't buy this set!,"This speaker set may seem like a good bargain for the money, but the sound quality is very poor and I was very dissapointed.Next time, I'll spend a little more and get a Klipsch THX system or a more expensive Logitech.Not even worth the $60."
3,"Worked fine at first, then subwoofer decreased power output","This Logitech X-540 worked fine at first. It put out quite a bit of bass for such a small subwoofer, and so cheap a system. It sounded fine for the cost, but was lacking low mids and upper bass, common for these type systems since the satellites don't carry any lower tones. The problem came about three weeks after I received it. I noticed the bass was missing. I turned up the subwoofer to max and increased the bass on the computers graphic equalizer, and was able to get less than half the bass it put out previously, though it was clear. I sent it back for a refund and went with a better product. Thank you Amazon!"
4,Good Sound- Short wires- No ipod connection,"These do sound good, but not better than I expecter for $90. I had to get 2 rca extentions for my L shaped desk, 5ft each. and I thought it had a plug for an ipod connection, but it does not. It could be hooked to one, but not without disconnecting it from the computer."
4,The X-540 A Nice Upgrade from the X-530,"Although this product has the same basic specifications as the X-530, it has some significant and note worthy changes, they are listed as follows:- fine mesh traded in for metal grill, the latter being more durable;- center speaker can now be mounted upon your LCD monitor;- separate control unit now provided (previously volume control was upon a speaker); and- matrix control makes sound more vibrantThis is a very cool surround sound system, and gives a nice cinematic experience when watching a movie, listening to music or playing a game. The sub-woofer really rumbles."
4,ok sound,"Others had given this speaker set a good review so I expected a great experience. I'm not sure if the problem is the speakers or my settings, but I can't get them to have a surround sound. The side/back speakers are too soft and I can't hear them, but when I turn them up I lose the center speakers sound. And I can either have the center or the front speakers dominate but not share the sound equally. The bass sounds good during music and tv, but is way too loud for windows computer sounds and I can't find a compromise between the two. I do like the control pad next to my keyboard so I can control the volume easily."
1,pathetic equipment state upon receiving it,"The subwoofer control was frozen and one of the front legs to the subwoofer was obviously damaged. Eventhough a refund was to be given to my credit card, I lost $30 in shipping the defective equipment back. If Amazon desires any further business from me, that return shipping cost of $30 needs to be refunded also."
2,"Typical and suports the stereotype of ""hookers"".","I did read Tracey Quans book and that was like a Penthouse Forum of sexcapades and this book makes her seem like she's on an ego trip and like other s have said..stereotypes everyone else while not realizing that's what she has done to herself. I was not surprised at the level of drug use nor the unprotected sex acts...that's what the public thinks about anyway and she successfully made their assumptions come true.Want something different to read? I have just put down ""The Call Girl Actress...Confessions of a Lesbian Escort"" by Erica Black and this book opened my eyes to a completely different view of the paid for sex world. Something very different so I won't give away the story."
5,Understanding what Rev. means by what it meant,"This is a good, fairly short summary of scholarly analysis of the book of Revelation, solidly grounded in what it meant to those who originally wrote and recopied it."
3,Teen story,A group of American teens in Costa Rica learnt surfing and sex encounters.Not much to watch but sexual explorations and handsome young male bodies explicitly reacting to beautiful female beach goers.Nice entertainment after something more sophisticated or horrors.
1,Overly Unimpressive Even When Expecting Unimpressive,"I went in to watching this movie expecting it to be stupid american pie style comedy, but the whole film was more stupid and poorly written then funny. I don't think i laughed during the whole movie. Not worth the time."
4,Dolly Charm,"Dolly sings the classic Christmas songs. If you like Dolly, you will enjoy this CD. I always loved her voice so I play this alot during the holidays."
5,Coley Running Wild Vol. 1,Enjoyed the book. I know John Blackbun personally and have encouraged him to write more. Great drawings and great sexual situations.
4,More thorough effort than Wonderland,"The first thing I take away from listening to this album is the diversity of styles- ""As I watch you in disbelief"" sounds like it could be from Tellin Stories, then you have Dead Love, a gorgoues little ditty that makes a nice album closer, there are also some slow ballads and ""I'll Sing you a Hymn"" which has the feeling of a church hymn. It didn't impress me too much to begin with, but upon further listenings it is growing on me. Overall, I like it quite a bit, and seeing as I haven't heard any information at all about when it will be released domestically, I'm glad I picked it up now."
5,Excellent product,This has assisted in keeping diaper rash at bay. The product has a nice fragrance and it does not seem to irritate my daughter's skin.
5,Very Helpful,"I bought this book for the Kindle and I like it so much I am now buying the hard copy . Although I love the Kindle I find it is better for novels than for reference books where you want to look things up and use the index. I woke up this morning with a sore neck, used the suggested mudra and in a few minutes felt better. The mudra or the power of positive thinking who cares I felt good. I also bought the card set which is ""handy""."
5,If you're serious about Yoga....,"Fascinating information. If you're really serious about the traditional techniques of yoga, this is a complementary must have!! You can tell the author's first language isn't English, but that kind of makes it fun too."
1,waiting for my death to come,"Why cant i give this product zero stars? this is the worst peice of crap ever. I cant beleive that these types of CDS are stinking up our music stores. Don't buy it, you will feel really grimy and dirty after you listen to it."
3,Hes lucky hes got a voice,"After hearing rave reviews about this album, I decided to pick it up myself. I was not completley blown away, but the music was still treading new ground and I respected that. The single you hear on the radio is great, and its very catchy, plus shows off the vocals Mraz has. While the rest of the cd is OK, the one track took my breath away was ""Absolutely Zero"". This song is Superb, and stands far above the rest with its superior song writing and vocals that are just killer. The CD is worth this track.Good Tracks: The Remedy, Absolutely Zero"
5,Very great album!,"This Jason Mraz album is one of my favourites ever. I can listen to it over and over again and not get sick of it. Jason is very talented and, in my opinion, the best modern musician out there."
5,A new master mind,"Over a year ago, on [the web], i typed in my last name which happens to be Mraz. I came up with Jason Mraz and I instantly fell in love with his sound. At the time he sounded different but he still was great. He sounds even better on the album and is a true spirit lifter. Although many compare him to the Dave Matthews Band, I say dont, he is genuis in his own right. He can lift you out of any slump or problem. Its a great album to listen to in summertime, well, anytime! If you only buy one cd BUY THIS ONE!!"
3,Better Live,"Instead of buying ""Waiting for My Rocket to Come"", try to find his live album. Unlike John Mayer, Mraz is better live."
2,lose the band,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of artists with actual musicians backing them up. But in Mraz's case, the backup turns his music into ""bright shimmering pop."" Which personally, I'm not a fan of, in fact I'm upset I actually bought the cd. Mraz's musicianship and talent is lost in these grossly cheerful and superficial renditions of his music. I think he's an decent artist, with a lot of growth to come, which is apparent in his live music. Want to hear some of his best stuff where he sheds the ""Mayer sound""? Download some of his live stuff, then support Jason for the true musician he is and see his show, preferably one with just a acoustic guitar and maybe a conga or two accompanying him."
5,Totally Awsome,This is one of my favorite CD's and Jason Mraz is one of my favorite artists. He has an amazing voice and you can tell that he gets so into his music. He has his own unique style and you can tell what kind of person he is just from his music.This is a totally awsome CD and you have to get it if you don't have it already
2,Waiting for a better album to come,"The only songs worth listening to on this album are the ones that bear similarity to the hit ""The Remedy"", which is good for its interesting lyrical flow and rhythm. What I found as I listened to this C.D. was that most of the melodies had overly simplistic beats, not enough instruments, or rather crappy songwriting. It seems to me that Jason needs to take his music to the next level, for the album as a whole creates the impression that he simply rushed through it and then called it a day. While Jason appears relatively skilled with his all-out rock pieces, his softer songs all have a dull feel to them and do not have enough variation to be likeable for their full lengths. If nothing else, though, this C.D. seems to be a lot more outgoing as well as more commendable than Jason Mraz's ""Mr. A to Z"" album. I would not recommend Waiting for My Rocket to Come, for Jason has a fairly tedious style which has yet to be improved on."
2,It's oh so pleasant.,"Jason Mraz is the new Hootie! Stilted and self-conscious, and just a bit aloof. Strictly for the foam-trucker-hat, ""we want to rock but can't loosen up"" crowd. This one has an expiration date, and it's coming up fast."
3,Not quite as good...,"I liked it - Mraz's playful singing is always a good listen, but it wasn't as much to my taste as A to Z. Just shows to go-ya, I guess, improvement sometimes comes with age."
4,Takes the yellow out...,The product takes the yellow out of blond or grey hair. Makes it shine and blends salt and pepper hair.
5,"Product is fine, but packaging leaves a lot to remedy!","I've used this product for a long time and felt that ordering it from Amazon would save me some money. Instead I lost product(some of the shampoo which leaked inside of box material and ran over the ream of paper causing loss of lot of ream of paper and a wet cloth bag containing a bracelet I order, but this came late and in the wrong color metal-I ordered rose gold and was sent yellow gold bracelet). Need I say more? I am steamed from cleaning up in and outside of my home andvery disappointed in this company's packaging and unless something is done to rectify this awful mess, I will not use this shipper again.I know I am only one customer and probably don't matter to you, but if this happens to several hundred ""ones"", you'll lose a lot of money because of negligence."
2,Not all its cracked up to be,"I have white hair and used Pantene Silver Expressions until they decided to discontinue--Grrrrrr!! I have actively been in search of a replacement and this shampoo came highly recommended by other reviewers. I personally don't like it for 2 reasons-- 1 is because it leaves your hands purple when using it and I'm pretty sure if it colors your hands, it's adding some color to your hair!! I WANT mine as white as possible! 2 is because it stinks! It smells like really strong bath soap or kitchen soap. NOT good!! I've found the best product so far to be the Jhirmack silver shampoo. Hope this helps!!"
1,This product turned my hair blue!,I used this shampoo and conditioner on my blonde highlighted hair for about a week. First of all the purple color of the product stained my hands and my towels. It took all the yellow out of my blonde highlights and then proceeded to turn my hair blue. The next day I used a normal shampoo and conditioner and it turned my green. Needless to say I had to go to my hairdresser and get my color fixed. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR YOU WILL END UP PAYING MORE MONEY TO FIX YOUR COLOR.
3,Updated review...won't buy it again...,"Having highlighted hair, my stylist recommended this product to contain any brassiness or redness that would appear between salon visits.Beware, it is purple and your towels will have streaks of purple, which wash out easily.It does work to some degree but I would not recommend using it often.Also, after washing and using conditioner, hair seems darker, but that disappears as you switch between other quality shampoos and conditioners.It also leaves a drying effect to the hair. If you are coloring and highlighting your hair, it becomes coarser and generally does not benefit from further drying out."
1,bad smell!!!,"I just bought this shampoo. Don't see any clarity yet, but the smell is awful! Don't know if I can continue to use it to see if it works."
4,Clairol Shimmer Lights 31.5 oz. Shampoo,"I have been using this product for years. I intend to continue to do so. This dealer is one of few sources for the quart container. Additionally, the price is very reasonable."
2,Purple Stains,"I have gray hair and bought this shampoo to take out the yellowish tints. Maybe you're not supposed to use it every day, maybe that was the problem, but I ended up with purple stains on my pillow case and sheets where my head rested at night. I bleached the heck out of them, but the stains are permanent. I may try it again after a while and try it once a week or something, but I wash my hair every morning and this just won't work for me as a daily shampoo. If I had kept it up, I guess my hair would've turned bright purple, I don't know, and my pillow cases would all be ruined."
4,Delivers What It Promises,"Clairol Shimmer Light Shampoo Blonde & Silver 8 oz. is a popular-priced shampoo that really, so far as I'm concerned, delivers what it promises. It reinforces blonde or light brown hair color, giving it lots of sheen; and it punches up blonde highlights, in between those expensive trips to the beauty salon. (And we all know that to go blonde, even just for highlights, means you might as well keep a sleeping bag at your favorite salon.) And, although I haven't tried most of the colors, I can tell you that several years ago, I wore my naturally reddish hair in a reddish shade, how's about that! And the Clairol Red Shampoo punched that up almost too much. Finally, this shampoo is relatively economical as just a little dab will do you, and it lathers up nicely, with a pleasant aroma, to which perfume, thankfully, I am not allergic, and I'm allergic to so many scents. No downside that I can see."
5,I love my Joyce Chen carbon steele Wok.,"The wok works great, I just love it. I use it for practically everything I cook.The delivery of the product was much quicker than expected. I couldn't be happier."
2,Seasoning disaster,"I followed the instructions of rubbing oil and heating. Very quickly, the oil started burning (even though I heated it on medium heat as instructed) and now have a blackened-bottom pan and a burning smell in the whole house without ever having cooked in it yet. Not sure where I went wrong but seasoning it is harder than it looks."
3,"Interesting setting, so-so mystery","Setting a murder mystery in Pearl Harbor, just prior to the Japanese attack makes this an interesting read. The bits of history are fascinating and compensate for the rather pedestrian plot. Combining fictional and historical figures works well as they seamlessly combine, but the basic problem is the mystery is no mystery. The plot moves along at a good clip; but it leads to a foregone conclusion. Using Edgar Rice Burroughs as the detective fits in with the actual events, but it seems almost an afterthought, and is merely another hook to get readers interested. Not a bad little page turner, but nothing else."
5,LIfe Intertwines,"I think once again,she has written as only she can!Such feeling she can bring to you.Get this book.Nadia Rehmani"
5,love this series!!!,"I have to agree with one of the other reviews about book #3 in this series. It dragged and could have been better. This book made up for that and I look foward to more in this series. In book #4 we find Lydianne and Abe growing up with Lydianne starting her ""running around years"". Aunt Lizzie finds happiness with a husband. Abe has a traumatic experience. Leah after years of sacrifice for her family *might* be back with Jonas.. Dr. Schwartz's secret is revealed.."
4,Engrossing,"After being well and truly hooked by the story and characters in the preceding 3 books in the series, I had to find out what happened them in book 4. Well written with believable, fallible characters with whom you can easily strike a rapport. Kept thinking about book long after the final page."
2,A Weak Attempt at Re-Revisionism,"This book is an ultimately unsatisfying attempt to rebut the rather substantial literature on disaffection, disloyalty, desertion, demoralization, and Unionism in the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Gallagher does this by selecting weak points of various historian's arguments (without engaging their strong points), focusing on particularly weak books, and making various special pleadings. Although he occasionally makes very valid points, in the end, his arguments are very weak. Providing quotations from people who supported the Confederacy in no way diminishes the fact that many other people were disenchanted with it. In the end, Gallagher's attempt to stem the historiographical tide will be seen to have been unsuccessful."
2,Disappointed,When I first placed my order for the elementary statistics book I had emailedthe company within an hour of the purchase to ask about canceling it or returning it. I received no response. My order was for a new book that also came with a CD. I instead received a clearly used book and nothing else. Very disappointed
4,Too brutal for me to continue,"I read over 150 pages and cannot continue to read about torture/brutality. The story is very well written, intense, suspenseful. The brutality is where I draw the line on reading."
5,The Best Fantisy Book I've Ever Read!,"The book is about a man who comes from ""the real world""into a world of fantisy. A gril named Ivy brings him to Xanth after the Heven Cent takes her to the ""real world""(Mundania). She trys to find him a talent so they can get married.This book is undobitly the best book ever. I give it more than five stars. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. I highly recommend it."
2,"Much of this is old hat, unfortunately","A friend of mine who knows I have an interest in pricing sent me a free copy of this book. Michael Marn has led the pricing practice at McKinsey & Company for a long time now, and I'd been wondering why he hadn't published a pricing book before now.Unfortunately it turns out to be something of a one-trick pony, and a pony pretty long in the tooth at that. About half of it talks about the well-known price-benefit map. No question it's a fundamental idea, but hardly leading edge. Plus you need a McKinsey team to execute it. Given the pedigree of the authors I was hoping for more. A lot of the book just repeats McKinsey's early work on price wars, postmerger pricing, and overall strategy--good stuff but again nothing new.If you're interested in pricing, in my opinion there are better options than this. ..."
2,...a word of caution to buyer & producer both,"Too few things from tv's ""golden"" age are in release and too many lousy things ARE available in complete form. The way Gunsmoke is being treated only encourages that trend. They hurt their own market. A word of caution; We live in a capitalist system, supply and demand. If owners of a program don't supply a show in a timely reasonable way they CREATE a bootleg market. Gunsmoke is widely pirated for that reason. It's a shame, and owners of such programs like to bemoan this illegal activity, but in some cases they are among the biggest contributers to it! Another larger segment of the public will simply stay away from slowly released and over priced sets like this. (There is certainly no lack of shows competing for sales out there, even if most are much lower quality programs.) You are shooting yourself in the foot and denying the public a great show at the same time. Wise up!!!"
1,Not enough episodes for the money!,"Folks, I am 64. I saw the Gunsmoke series when it was a first run series. The first year was properly done, even tho there was no booklet giving pertinent facts and goodies included. The price was fair. Now we are being presented with the FIRST HALF of the second season at about the same price!? Ridiculous!I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, but I will NOT buy any subsequent seasons or half seasons until the price comes down to equal the first season's price per episode. I cannot afford it. Hopefully, Paramount will see the errors of their ways and correct the problem they created. This is akin to the old bait and switch practice.Call Paramount and complain! The number is elsewhere in these reviews."
1,Shameful! Disgraceful!,"There are no words to describe how thrilled I was to get my hands on the entire 1st season of my favorite series from years ago.Again there are no words to describe how disappointed I am to see how season 2 is being marketed. I will buy no more, at this rate (if I do, I will buy them used).I agree with everyone else. No more...until a change is made.I just purchased the entire 3rd season of Wanted Dead Or Alive....the whole banana for around fifteen dollars at Sam's! Unless I can get the first part of season 2 at that price, forget it!I'm miffed, and so should we all be."
1,gunsmoke diesater,"All the talk about the gunsomke problem is ok, but we need real awnsers.is anyone really trying to fix the problem? Is there any picket lines?,anyone trying to get to the stuios head people? anyone geting this storyinto the press? Someone must have the power ,knowledge and abilty to getto the producers of this series and let them know our feelings. At thisrate I will be dead before the series is even half out. lets all put upa real stink and make them listin. lets ACT AND NOT JUST COMPLAIN.Gunsmoke: The Second Season, Vol. 2"
5,Gunsmoke from the best wholesome TV Era ever...,"TV will never be like it was back in the 50 60 70 and 80's. Todays so called shows are mainly garbage with it's sex perversion and no talent actors... to bad... but wait, not really for thankfully we have these series like Gunsmoke and many others with our great actors like James Arness, to buy watch and enjoy... : ) so long trash television YES!!!"
4,Very Good,"Why in the world do these record people keep taking this CD off the market. This is a solid jam CD that has some great gutiar work from Warren Haynes. He was in the Allman Brother for awhile and he can flat out play the slide guitar. Great song, Life Before Insanity. Buy this CD if you can find it. You won't be sorry."
2,No Dose,"I was not crazy about their first album but, Dose I felt was a masterpiece. I was hoping that the first album maybe they were just finding thier grove. This album to me reminds me of their first not so much musically but the lack of feeling. I know that these are three very talented musicians but, this album to me is very boring."
1,One Horrible CD,"This CD is filled with boring, uninspired, bad vocalized songs. It is nothing like Identity. I was very disappointed. This one is headed to the used CD store for another unsuspecting fan of Samantha to waste his/her money on purchasing. Sorry fans...it's just no good. I don't know what some of these people were listening to who gave it five stars!"
2,"Good Info, but too much filler.","This book has some good ideas, philosophies and strategies at it's core. Unfortunately, that core only makes for about 20% of the content of this book. The other 80% is fluff and filler. It reads like an info-commercial and at times you wonder if the author is a professional gambler or motivational speaker.Don't get me wrong, the core of this book is fantastic. The reason I bought this book was because I came to some of the same conclusions as the author. I was browsing this book at a bookstore and was amazed that I had come to the same revelations, but here they were in print! It was like finding a kindred spirit.Alas, these revelations and strategies can be summed up in a book about 1/5 this size. There is only one chapter of real information and value here. Thus, the 2 star rating."
4,"For the most part, a very good English cozy","A small village, interesting characters, interesting murder... Every bit as good as the first one, Murder at the Altar. The only drawback is that the main character, Ellie, allows other people to talk all over her and her daughter is bossy, self-centered, and interfering, with no manners. The book has compared her to her father, in which case you wonder why Ellie misses him so much. Her daughter really is a downpoint for the book and detracted from it. Having her as one of the characters is unfortunate and affects the enjoyment of it. I hope that she is seen far less in future Ellie Quick books, or she grows up a little bit. And that Ellie develops more of a backbone."
5,This book is great!,"I bought Sleep Thinking, started following the method a couple of weeks ago, and I'm already seeing results. I'm waking up earlier in the morning, and getting work done on a creative writing project that I've been putting off for too long. I'm encouraging all of my friends and colleagues to buy the book and start sleep thinking. The book is well-written, clear and easy to understand, with well-chosen examples that should make it easy for a broad spectrum of people to apply sleep thinking to a broad range of needs, for creative, personal, school, and business enrichment. Do yourself a favor, get this book and start sleep thinking."
2,A great history review for the right person,"No doubt this book is full of wit but it was lost on me. It is full of clever mis-statements of British history but you need to be conversant with the real version to get the gag. Me, I'm just left puzzled."
3,WWF WrestleMania 3 Review,"Let me set the record straight, this is not the greatest ppv of all time nor the greatest WrestleMania of all time. It had some quality matches, but Hogan-Andre for the main event equals 0 wrestling ability. Here you had Hulk Hogan who could put on a good show, but was no Shawn Michaels. Then on the other hand you had Andre The Giant. Sure, Andre was big, but the only thing he could execute well was a headbutt. I would have been happy with a Randy Savage-Ricky Steamboat main event. That IC Title match was one of the best WrestleMania matches I've ever seen. So if you listen to me, you'll buy this video, not expecting a stellar main event, but a solid undercard. If you listen to almost everyone else that says it was the greatest main event of all time, you'll be sadly disappointed."
1,Not what I thought it was,"This is a tiny little book with lots of pictures and very little substance to it. It's designed to ask questions of the reader and point out certain behaviors, and that's it. I didn't find the information in it very useful, but since I do volunteer work with children I decided to keep in around to refer to from time to time. I didn't find it to be a book for adults at all. My advice is don't waste your money."
2,Very Basic,This would be a good book for those just coming to terms with having been abused. It would be a good book for younger readers as well. It was a very basic read and didn't offer me any useful insights that I haven't gotten from more in-depth reading.
2,simple,This book is very simple. Large text and pictures. Its easy reading and I was able to whip through the book pretty quickly.
2,Too simplified-wasteful overview,"This DVD was a big disappointment. It does not convey ""why"" Louis Armstrong was so great. The documentary jumps around a lot and sometimes misses big parts of Armstrong's life. In fact there is very little Louis Armstrong on this DVD. If you want to know more about Louis Armstrong I'd recommend Gary Giddins' ""Louis Armstrong: Satchmo"" or Ken Burns' ""Jazz"" both on DVD. ""The Wonderful World of Louis Armstrong"" does not show the the magic or genius that was Louis Armstrong. Pops is Tops!!!"
4,The Wonderful World of Louis Armstrong,This DVD Is An Intimate Portrait Of The Legendary Jazz Performer. With Interviews And Acquaintances Remembering Louis Armstrong. (Fantastic Reference Material) There Are No Actual Performances Only Snippets Of His Music.
4,Excellent Product.,"This is a metel mirror that is almost industructable. I have put many portable mirrors in my pack only to have them break, some times in a marina shower stall. Although it is not as clear as a glass mirror, it works fine as a tool to help you shave."
1,Three Thumbs Down,"I would not waste my money on this video combo again. It portrays the entire state of Florida with all the enthusiasm of a glorified rest home. If I had not already been to Florida many times and known what it's really like, I would most likely be having second thoughts about visiting Florida after viewing this video. The photography is bad and the background music puts you to sleep. If I could do it again, I'd look around and find something better to spend my money on."
3,Pretty good for the money,"I get some distortion, but I've got the speakers in my kitchen with an iPod feeding tunes to the speakers and my receiver through a splitter."
2,You get what you pay for!,"These speakers are OK. Not the best. They work. Sound quality is tinny, static, and fades in and out. I keep them to remind me STOP, THINK, AND SPEND WISELY!! I want to buy Bose wireless speakers, but I need to be constantly reminded, and I would rather be reminded with $80 speakers then maybe something that costs a lot more. I would not recommend these speakers to anyone."
5,I love them!!,We just received these speakers. It was really easy to assemble and the sound is great. We put it on our tv but you can use it for any audio device. The speakers run on batteries or can be plugged in. The sound quality is amazing. Would reccomend to anyone looking for wireless speakers.
4,Very Satisfied,"I was a little concerned about static, and we did get some static when the speakers were plugged in the outlet with the cordless phone. We moved the speakers and they work just fine. I did not try them with just the batteries yet, as we have had no need. We were so happy with them we bought a second set."
1,Terrible product,I purchased these speakers hoping to extend my music about 20 feet. The streaming was fine but the music quality was just terrible. The bass was horrible and distorted all the music. Terrible product!
4,Audio Unlimited Wireless Speakers,"These work great around the pool. Hook up to my iPod and transmitter anywhere in back part of house and get good reception throughout the backyard. Power is limited so you won't get loud music but if you are look for good quality, low price and clean lower volume background music, these are a good deal IMO"
4,Audio Unlimited Wireless Speakers w/ Remote,"I really like these speakers!!! We take them outside and listen to music while we sit by our pond. It is about 100 feet back from the house and we can hear them loud & clear. Sometimes they sound a bit ""tinny"", but for the most part, they sound is just fine!"
2,Poor Quality Wireless,"I returned these because the wireless capability became very staticy at about 20 feet, and anybody walking by them made it worse. As someone else noted, they advertise 120 feet range, but the user manual states 35 feet (an estimate, based on my memory). They work fine at short distances, but that's not what I needed."
