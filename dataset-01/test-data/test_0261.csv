1,Nice waffles-PITA to clean!,"I've had this waffler for a little over a year and have used it quite a few times. At first, I used it every other weekend, but after having to clean this thing, I lost interest in making waffles. I can't believe that no one else has complained about the clean up process. The grids are not removable, so you have to try and clean the thing with a damp cloth as best as you can. If you use Pam, or some other spray on cooking oil, the oil gets in the hinge and stays there until you tilt the thing up to store it, then it comes out over time and leaves a mess in your cabinets. I just can't believe that a high end, expensive, waffle maker does not have removable grids for easy cleaning. I can't wait until this thing quits working so I have a good reason to replace it. Oh, by the way, it makes acceptable waffles. Not great, just acceptable!"
2,"Save Your Money, Look for Another Brand","Along with all the true comments about the unevenly cooked waffles, and the smoke alarm style alert, the unit is unstable when storing. After wrapping the cord, I pick up the unit by the loop hand to store it, but the loop only allows one side to be held. Once it was off the counter and over the floor, the other side opened, pinched my fingernail. This resulted in a drop unit, which shattered into 10 or so pieces. Poorly designed, should have a latch to keep unit closed when storing."
2,Very Difficult,"Although some claim it is classic, don't expect it to be readable. The book's definitions cna be quite confusing, and it is often difficult to understand many of the definitions or problems without a great deal of effort. If you are using this book for a class, I would reccomend getting a more readable text for reference."
4,almost great,"Easy to use, exchange plates, clean etc. The only problem I have had is the cooking because there is no light to help time when the food is cooked enough. Viilaware designed a great machine with one very big absence, the ""done light"". I tended to open machine before food is cooked enough so that the food came apart.Waffles especially are a problem because the batter amount differs on each pouring.When I guess correctly and raise the handle, machine has done a great job with heat distribution.I guessed correctly about 50% of the time. It took me twice as long to bake Italian waffle cookies due to this problem and I will have to buy different model similar to my old machine.One other FYI is to use a little cooking spray between batters to prevent sticking."
4,MCM and their MONSTER record!,"mcm and the monster rips on their second full-length release. if you've seen them live, you'll appreciate this cd much more. the quality may not be the best, but a solid album nevertheless!"
3,Very good information Helpful for Union Stewards.,Pretty consistent with other sources for laws on labor. It was easy to read and pretty interesting to me.
3,I tried it with mixed results.,"I read Winning Stocks with great excitement and anticipation. The stock picking strategy seemed compelling. I found the explanations of our ""rigged"" stock market enlightening and eye-opening. However, when I tried the author's ""Trinity"" system, I found it relatively ineffective. I followed the strategy religiously for 3 months and lost a fair amount of money. Granted, it was during the down market of 3/01-6/01, but it's supposed to work regardless of conditions. Either I missed something or the period was simply unfavorable for any investor. I'd be curious about other people's results."
1,Just a copy paste of various articles and quotes,"Although the book has a very lofty title ""Business - The Rupert Murdoch Way - 10 Secrets ..."", the reader would hardly connect to that.The writing style is inconsistent. You get a feel that the author wrote the book just because he was in a contract with the publisher to do so. Almost every alternate sentence is a copy paste of some source material integrated in a very loose way.Very disappointing."
1,BOOOOORING................. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............,"Unfortunately, these cards were veeeeery boring to my little Pokemon collector... They were very VERY common cards and he was a little less than excited to get them... They quickly went onto a pile of his ""dork cards"" he calls them, lol... ouch!! They were NOT the cards pictured, so please don't make the same mistake I did!! Wish I had bought something different.. or wish there was more variety or maybe a few good cards??? Would not recommend for your Pokemon fan :o("
4,"My Toddlers love this table - so sturdy, durable and beautiful color!","I have been looking for a table and chairs for my sons for several months. I saw this one, read the reviews and thought it would make a great buy. I'm so glad I decided on this one because it is perfect. There is room for them to grow more into it, but for now is perfect for them at ages 3 & 4. They color, read books, eat lunch and play with puzzles on it. It was so much heavier than I thought it would be - and fits in perfectly with our furniture! Excellent choice!"
1,Too big for a toddler,"Although Amazon says this table is for ages 3-7, KidKraft says it is for ages 5-8. It was much too big for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. The table and chairs were both too high, so she was not comfortable sitting there. Also, our kit was missing some washers and both of the chairs wouldn't assemble properly. The customer service at KidKraft was very nice and willing to send replacement parts, but we decided to return the entire table because of the size. We found a 19 inch table that fits our daughter perfectly."
2,"Came damaged, should have returned and now can't use one chair",I was excited to get this table and chair set for my kids at a good price. It arrived and was ealy to put together BUT the back of one chair was loose on one side. I thoght about returning it but that seemed like a pain so my husband glued it together. Well now the back top section broke off. Pretty sure it can't be fixed so we only have one chair now.
1,Junk!,"The set looks great, looks like it's solid, sturdy. No such luck! One leg broke in half after only 4 months of usage. A 3 years old fell off (luckily we have carpet). It is hard to comprehend. How can a tiny girl break a chair?! The warranty is 90 days, and the chair broke in 4 months. So, no returns are accepted. I never write bad reviews, but this is just outrageous. Junk, junk, junk!"
4,It's awesome!,"I got this table and chairs for my 19 months old daughter. I was looking for nice and solid table and chairs. I spent a lot of time to research, but I realized that amazon has a best deal with better product. They shipped to my house right on time without any damages. This product has a good design and is very solid as much as I can sit and play with her. The table and chairs are pretty big for my daughter, but I don't worry about it since she grows so fast. I really like them!"
2,"Almost, but not quite....","It is a shame, because I was so exited when I first saw the Crunch,""a multi-tool with vicegrips? What could be better?""Unfortunately, the lack of tool hardening makes for great pliers, but soft tools that seem to degrade every time I use them. I Scratched the FILE on a NAIL I was trying to file down, How sad. All my flathead screwdrivers are twisted or bent, and the Phillips is rounded out and does not really grip screws well anymore. I don't remember my other multi-tools from Leatherman being made of such soft metal. Great Idea, but this tool suffers from poor execution."
4,Pizzelle/Gallette maker,"This cookie baker works well and bakes evenly but it's hard to get it completely clean. Unfortunately, it also appears to have been discontinued."
4,Great Utility Chisels,"I have a Marples 1 1/4 inch chisel. The back didn't take too long to flatten, considering the width (it was slightly convex). The edge does blunt more quickly than my set of expensive chisels, so I don't use it to chop dovetails in hard or abrasive wood. It does a nice job as a utlity chisel - cleaning up glue joints, light trimming, etc., so I don't have to use my good chisels for those jobs. It's long blade is a big advantage over hardware store chisels. I'm about to buy a set."
1,seriously?,"How could a group of generally good actors put together a movie this bad? We stopped watching after an hour. The next day, we decided maybe we were being too harsh. We 'resumed' play. No, we were right the first time. This movie sucks dog water. Fail."
4,Good Value,"The unit works well... The infrared night light is a real plus. The infrared light surprised me as far as distance and uniform lighting. The unit is compact, and easy to use.The best feature for me is the wide field of view."
5,Very Clear!,"Very clear view, even with magnification. Lightweight and simple. Only very expensive($500.00++) night vision technology has any reasonable improvements in quality over the Cyclops."
1,More of a pamphlet than a book,"There was no information in this pamphlet that I could not have gotten for free online. I thought I was buying a book, not a pamphlet for $10. I wouldn't bother. You can get similar info at the pet store."
3,Helpful but there are better books for the money,"This book was recommended to me by my dog trainer and it did offer some helpful insights and training tips in dealing with a fear aggression dog.But, if you have a dog that is fearful, you have probably heard all of these suggestions before.This is a short book - 30 pages - and while it has some good suggestions, there are plenty of other similar books out there with more ""meat"".If you don't have a lot of time to read, are new to dealing with your dog's fear and just want some good basic training tips presented in a very simple, straightforward manner, this would be a good book. But if you want more detail and a book that offers more depth, I'd invest the $6.95 and put it toward a different book."
3,The Cautious Canine,"Another excellent informative ""brochure"". The information is sound and helpful however this is another ""short"" book. I was disappointed with it's length. I would recommend that this book also be checked out from the library rather than purchased."
2,Not what was advertised,"This should not be advertised as a book since it is just a small booklet 5"" by 8"" with only 28 pages. There was very little useful information found in this little pamplet. Buying books sight unseen is risky business. Book stores are your best bet."
1,half of the book was missing,"I bought this book several months ago, but never got around to reading it until recently. I read pages 1-6 thinking ""This is good information. I flipped the page only to have the pages start over at page 1-6. Because of the way that this book was constructedstaped together, pages 23-30 also repeated. Even worse is the fact that pages 7-22 were COMPLETELY MISSING. I am VERY disappointed."
5,Great Product,"I just recieved mine and thought that I would write a review. This is the best multitool that I have ever owned. It is very good looking and has a finish that will not scratch. There are four blades when closed (knife, file, 2 saw). When it is open there are needle nose pliars with a good wire cutter. The scisors come out and then open into scisors, this is pretty cool. There is also 3 straight and 1 philips head screwdrivers. The best part is that all the blades lock, you have to press a button to release them.Comes with a great leather belt holder."
2,Decent for small jobs,"This tool is okay for small jobs like installing a smoke detector, putting together a computer desk, opening boxes, etc. The only problem is I've had this tool for over two years and all I ever used were the screwdrivers, scissors, and knives which everybody has around the house. I hardly even need to use it; about every few months it comes in handy. To me it's over-rated and over-priced, you should stick with your regular tools if you ask me."
1,Buy a Gerber!,"I also had a leatherman... I recently bought a Gerber... what an amazing piece of hardware. It's stury, feels good in my hand and side-by-side, there's NO comparison!"
3,"Works well, but not enough to buy again","I bought a Leatherman Wave to use primarily as my tool of choice for sailing. The blades are sharp as hell (as evidenced by cuts on fingers). However, some of the tools such as the smaller screwdrivers require me to use my fingernails to dig them out (I have no fingernails, so it hurts). Plus, to open the pliers requires two hands unlike the Gerber multitools which can be opened with a good snap of the wrist. The only totally awesome part is that Leatherman's warranty is excellent with good turnaround. I'll keep this until I lose it or it gets dropped in the drink and I'll go Gerber after this."
4,Cast provide penty of fun for this OCR.,"BYE BYE BIRDIE was a show with nothing more in mind but to provide a light entertaining evening for theatre-goers. It went on to win the 1961 Tony award for Best Musical and has since become one of the most frequently staged musicals by high schools and community groups. The score by Charles Strouse is bright and lively, and Lee Adams' lyrics are clever, especially his satires on the popular music of the day.Columbia's original Broadway cast album is still the best of the 4 available recordings. The London cast with Peter Marshall proves once agan that the Brits just don't understand American performing styles. The dreadful 1963 film tries to turn it into a showcase for Ann Magaret, and the 1995 TV version with Jason Alexander is curiously short on fun. On this CD Van Dyke, Rivera and company provide plenty! Great liner notes and detailed synopsis... and all at a great price!"
4,first Keillor book for me,"I did enjoy this book, but I think that it takes a certain type of reader to appriciate it. The book is the first that I've read that really doesn't have a plot. It is a gathering of short stories strung together to tell the life of John Tollefson and his ancestors. The book really has no driving force to move it along, but it somehow still manages to move along quite enjoyably.I certainly will consider reading further works of Mr. Keillor's. If you are just looking for an easy, comfortable read then you ought to consider this."
3,A few brilliant passages,"The author makes a few brilliant statements that are worth remembering...such as the one on leadership. However, the protagonist defintly does not know much on romancing women. He seemed somewhat cliched and downright worrisome. It seems he got all his moves from bad tv romances. I do love the stories the other chaaracters tell about their journeys through life, though. It is an amusing and enteertaining book and worth reading."
2,Enforce Your Latina Stereotypes Here,"This novel does not depict the reality of the mean streets. What was Murray thinking when she wrote this in a first person voice? Murray herself states that she had no real experience of the gangster life. She wrote what she imagined was a girl's life as a gangster. How much research did she do before she wrote this novel?! None, if you ask me. Her attempts to present the daily life of someone caught up in this world are cute."
1,The CD doors on the unit malfunctioned from the day I got it,"This was my Christmas gift and my husband and I spent a lot of time researching a new cd player before we settled on it. I was very disappointed when I received it and set it up and it didn't work. The iPod portion worked fine but neither of the doors on the cd player worked. One just opened and closed repeatedly by itself and the other side wouldn't open at all. I sent it back to the manufacturer and besides acknowledging it's receipt, I haven't received a response as to when they are going to get a new one to me that works."
4,neoclassical is back!,"Fans of Yngwie in the late '80's/early '90's will appreciate this CD a lot. The brainchild of Swedish guitarist (where else?!)Thomas Wolf, this could be an Yngwie CD, but with a more vocal hook oriented style. The production is also excellent, and the playing flawless. These guys started as an AOR band, but this latest (4th) album is radically different, and if you like the speed kings of yesteryear, go for it, technique is back!!"
5,Wolo motorcycle horn,Very loud horn. This is an excellent product for anyone looking for that horn that will get attention when riding your motorcycle.You will NOT be disapointed with this product!
4,"good looking, good price, not comfy","The summary of my review is in the title. I've had these stools for a few months, and I looked around a lot before I got them. Compared to other ones I've seen they are very nice and good looking for their price. Construction is sturdy, and they have a good range of height.They are not very comfortable and give me some lower back pain if I sit for long, but I only occasionally use them.I would recommend them in general as a nice addition to your counter/bar, but not if you want them for more than occasional use. In that case I would go for something comfier, possibly with a little back support."
4,Great for the price,"I ordered 2 sets of these bar stools, and it was a breeze to put together. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated they had a weird smell right out of packaging; however, a quick wipe down with a soapy rag did the trick. The only complaint I would have is that two of the seats had partial indents. This could be due to the packaging, but it is a minor inconvenience. Hopefully the indents work themselves out in a few days."
2,Not for fatties OR skinnies!,"I read the reviews and was encouraged that the hydraulic lift would maintain its hold for anyone less than 200lbs. I am 5'4"" and 125lbs. and this baby rocked and slowly took me on a ride...to the bottom. You get what you pay for. Maybe it would be satisfactory for kids. Maybe."
3,"nice, but not adjustable","These are very decent stools. They are stylish and pretty sturdy, and fit well in a smallish space. The only problem is that although they are described as adjustable, they are not. Luckily, they sit at just barely below 24"" , which works well with my counter. The little lever on the side appears to be for show, and is useless."
1,Picture missleads,"I realize I should have read the term ""tea table"", and looked it up because I didn't know what it meant. The picture is clearly at least ""42 high, given the proportions of the top and base. Not returning it or even asking for a refund because I get it, it was my fault. But this kind of B.S. is hopefully going to put this company out of business."
3,You get what you pay for sometimes.,"I bought this set for $80...very cool modern and sleek looking....We just needed something that would look good on our granite breakfast bar and these fit the bill.My only complaint is that the seat is pleather...which is cool cuz it wont rip or anything, but if you look closely you can tell they are cheaply made. Also one stool bent and we cant get it to straighten out. I weigh 155 lbs and my fiance weighs 105 lbs and are the only ones who have sat on them. weird.oh well..for less than $100 for two stools, they are worth the money"
5,My dream chairs,"Hi,Me and my husband verified lots of stores for bar chairs and finally we liked these..... Back support is lil less but still its very contemporary item everyone wants to decorate with...2 cute chairs with height adjustments., I loved these so much this is my hubby's gift. This is our first shopping together after our marriage so its very precious.The one who gets this chairs will really feel the pleasure to have them... i mean it."
4,Exactly what I expected,This set was exactly what I expected based on the other reviews I read. Very easy to assemble and looks great.
2,Malfunctioning Chair,"I would have given these chairs a 5 star rating, because the chairs are just like they look in the picture. The reason for the 2 star rating is that one of the chairs doesn't have a proper seal for the pressure when the chair is raised. In other words, when the chair is at it's maximum height and someone sits on it, it will slowly go down to the minimum height after about 20 seconds. So it seems to me you are taking a gamble by buying these. Hopefully the other working chair will withstand the test of time.On a separate note, the accompanying table (sold separately) had a big chunk dinged out of the top edge of the table, so I cant recommend that either."
3,Ok,"This was nice enough when it came, however I had returned it because was to be a gift and the person had bought another set (different) somewhere else."
5,Perfect stools,Just what I was hoping they would be. Perfect set of stools. Think I have room for 4 so I'm going to order another set. Assembled in about 5 minutes each. Love them.
2,"High price, low quality","These chairs are made of plastic & lightweight chrome. They are not very sturdy, and though I am only 110 lbs, they tend to sink from my weight when raised using the air lift. They aren't worth the cost (I paid $83 through Amazon) because they just aren't a quality product. I'd pay about $40 to feel I got my money's worth. Won't be worth it to send back because of shipping charges, but I won't buy furniture from Amazon again sight unseen, and these will end up outside as summer patio furniture (with the pub table i bought)."
4,Excellent barstools for the price,"Bought this air of Winsome bar stools through FurnitureMaxx recently. I am quite impressed with the style and quality. I use it for the island in my kitchen. The installation was very easy and it took me 10 minutes to install both the bar stools. Looks very stylish and pretty comfortable too, in spite of not having a full back rest. Pretty light weight, so I can easily move them around. Also, adjusting the stool's height is a breeze. The only concern I have is that the seat is not too thick. So if it is sat on for a longer time, you can see the impressions of the screws from the bottom of the seat. I am hoping that does not damage the seat over a long period of time. Other than that, it is a nice sturdy bar stool and worth every penny."
4,excellent value,"If your not expecting the world, these stools are certainly functional and a visual delight if you like a sleek modern look. Padding in the seat is minimal, but, at this price about what you would expect."
4,great for the price!! Does anyone know if the plastic under these stools are hardwood safe?,These are great so far. But I'm concerned if the plastic under these are hardwood safe. Does anyone know?
3,"Good for the price, but be careful","These stools are affordable and stylish. They arrived very soon and they are very easy to install. Personally I like them and will keep them.But be careful, this stool is only good for people within a very narrow range of weight. My wife is ~105 lb, and she cannot adjust this stool down by her own weight. I have to do it for her. I am ~140 lb, and it seems that it cannot withstand my weight. Occansionally I push it down by 1 inch whithout touching the adjusting lever. So, if you are as light as my wife (~105 lb), or heavier than me (~140 lb), these are not good stools for you."
1,Bummer: what I wished I would have known before buying this lemon!,"Man, oh, man...what a huge and EXPENSIVE mistake in buying this ""pig."" I've had mine for a year now and have never been able to get it to perform well. I've even contacted the manufacturer, to no avail. Essentially, the top element doesn't do the trick and I end up with white-on-the-top and brown-on-the-bottom waffles. If I increase the heat control, I get drier waffles that are much browner on the bottom, but not on the top (it's still white). I've had to flip the waffles over to get browning on both sides.Not only the cooking woes, but also the fact that it's heavy and clunky, add up to making this a NOT recommended waffler choice.When I can, I'll find a $15 Toastmaster and toss this crappy VillaWare waffler into a Goodwill donation box."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I bought 5 dvds from another vendor, including this same dvd. I remember years ago reading something about poor color quality from these overseas dvds. But at $1 each - I thought I would give them a shot since my grandson was coming to visit. These are made in China and the color is HORRENDOUS. Tons of red dominating and blues are purple. I am going to complain to the store that stocked these for sale. These dvds are made by DIGIVIEW ENTERTAINMENT."
5,Grab your Babe and Hold On!,"Don't put this CD on in the late evening or you'll be up all night.... Dancing! I mean these cats know how to jump, jive and wail. The pedal steel guitar will twang your heart, the sax will burn your soul. Ray has a voice that is slatherin' with dirty, low-down jitterbug. If you can remain seated during the first cut ""Hadicillin Boogie"" you better call 911... you're dead!"
4,A burnin' hunk of western swing!,"From the moment ""Hadicillin Boogie"" starts coming out of your speakers, you're going to fall in love with this record.And if you're the observant type, you may even remember that this track currently appears in a commercial for the Honda Accord. A couple are driving along a lonely Texas freeway in their Accord, ""Hadicillin Boogie"" is playing on the stereo, and they have a good natured nonverbal dispute over how loud to play this song (inadvertantly demonstrating the convenience of auxiliary volume controls mounted on the steering wheel).Hopefully, the exposure will get Ray Condo and his band some more recognition. This is an excellent record--35 minutes of swing, jazz, and rockabilly. The only problem I have with this record is that ""Hadicillin"" rocks SO hard that it almost overshadows the rest of the album. A great cut overshadowing a bunch of good cuts--now that's the kind of problem I wish more records had."
3,Not for smaller hands,"This mouse is very elongated for smaller (adult female) hands so I can't rest my wrist on my mousepad wrist wrest and still reach the scroll wheel or the buttons. I find that after prolonged use my hand and wrist hurt. From an aesthetic only point of view, this mouse isn't what I wanted either. I bought it because it was described as ""green"" and while it's about half greenish-black metallic, it lights up red on the sides and top which makes it look more brown than green (kinda ugly, actually). I am giving it to my husband and looking for something else..."
4,pretty useful and handy tool,"i always wanted to buy a tool like this.and am glad bought this one.has a number of in built tools, is very handyand comes with it's own carrying case.if you have been thinking about purchasing amultifunction tool, this is a very good one tostart with !"
5,Awsome,Everyone that sees this knife set wants to know where i got it. It does stand a bit bigger than most knife sets but it looks awsome.
1,"Huge Package, I had to pay 350$ only for shipping",The shipping weight announced in the page is 8 times less than the real one. I had to pay 350$ for final destination (freight forward) in shipping for a 24$ item (it was the price at that time). Amazon and their partners have to learn delivering packages in SMALL boxes.
4,Not entirely accurate portrayal of life with new baby,"This book has a lot of pluses. It shows new parents tired. It illustrates that newborns often cry and aren't developed enough for games or books. But I find myself at times having to amend the text to reflect the realities of ""new baby"" life. Ex. ""What can you do with a new baby? You can cuddle her [under parental supervision]...or give her a rattle to play with [when she's three months or older and capable of playing with toys a little.]"" I'm also disappointed that this book exclusively shows bottle feeding and no breastfeeding (since nursing a baby really takes up A LOT of a mother's time and an older sibling may resent this physical closeness). Not a bad ""new baby"" book, but not as accurate as Annie Kubler's ""My New Baby."""
3,Not what I was expecting,Typically LOVE the books by this author..but this one ends as if the book is missing a few last pages. It will do for explaining the arrival of a new baby...but if you can find a better book....I would suggest you pass on this one.
4,A great new sibling book,"Just bought my second copy of this book to give it to my niece. The book is funny and entertaining with cute pictures, and it conveys the message that new siblings are a great thing."
4,Low penetration,"This is the intense collaboration of Mick Harris--in his Lull mode--and Bill Laswell who combine here to create one of the unsung masterpieces of dark ambient sounds.The two lengthy tracks, Digital Sonority and Capacious, are what they say, and more. Low sustained tones, rumbling penetrating soundscapes--this is maximum drone music, suitable for a rainy afternoon, a late night, or a snowbound all-day-long...or any time you need vast emotional space, a vision of things to come based on things that have already been....Sink into it..."
3,It was okay.,"I was excited to receive this because all the reviews were excellent. It's okay, but it's not great. The recipes aren't all that appealing and there are absolutely no pictures at all. It's totally uninspiring. I was disappointed."
4,Satisfied Customer,"I purchased this table and chairs for my two year old granddaughter. It has been a real hit. The chair is constructed of good quality and was easy to put together with very understandable directions. The allen wrench that was enclosed, however, was not sufficient to put the screws in. I needed a stronger tool - which luckily I had. That would be my only warning. My granddaughter loves playing at the table - it should do her for several years. The chairs are strong enough for me to use also. They are also light enough that she can move them around without hurting herself."
4,"overall good, but top warps every time","My 2 kids (17 mo girl and 5 yr old boy) LOVE this table and use every day for 3 years now. First table arrived and within months the top was warped. Asked for replacement, which they promptly sent, but 2nd table did it again. Could be because of where this is made (different humidity levels), but overall great item for the price - just wish it wasn't warped since the markers/crayons roll away from kids. Perfect size for my 2 kids."
1,I am sure they would be delicious if they were not soup,"I would say I was glad I got these Belgian chocolate seashells for a dear friend,but I was distressed when I saw the condition they arrived in.The entire box was a melted gooey mess.Do NOT order this if you live somewhere even semi-warm,even with paying extra for one day shipping it did no good.These might be a great gift for someone who lives in Anchorage Alaska."
4,Good move to cut your power bill.,"This produce only makes since in today's economic environment. I don't have any power usage data yet, but I do know that the AC run time is less. Installation instructions were good and the actual installation was a snap. Setting the program control information was a different mater. The instruction were OK but they could be make clearer. It is a good thing you can detach this thermostat from the wall and program it while setting down. It would be frustrating having to do it while standing up.Programing instruction is the only reason I would not rate this at 5 stars."
3,"Not as good as the first book, but still enjoyed it","I bought ""The Payback Man"" only for the fact that it was the second book in the creature comfort series, while I enjoyed the book, it didn't was not as good as ""The Money Man."" The main reason that I didn't like the book was the whole Prison setting of the book. It was a decent read, but if it was not part of a series I would more than likely have skipped this book."
5,impressive,Having seen a carpenter friend of mine using this tool I decided to buy one myself. Installing cupboard doors was quick with minimum effort. It really saves a lot of time.
3,You Have to Be Kidding,"Sure, it's a classic, that ONE song. It's from the 60's but sounds so doo wop 50's. Can you believe the price? Somewhere this ONE must be on a fourteen-dollar compilation album. Unless you are a trivia nut, that ONE song will be all you will want anyway. I've heard some of the others back when. The album price reminds me of the bum on the street corner selling pencils for $1,000,000 each. When asked, ""Why so much?"", he said, ""I only have to sell ONE""."
3,better than no band at all,"If you want to play along with a country band, this will do what it says. Provide a backup band for you.Unfortunately, this band is made up of some really bored players. Competent, but no enthusiasm.I've heard quite a few country bands in small town barrooms and most of them had more life in them than the band on this disc.Still, for the price, it will give you the opportunity to play along in your living room.I ordered this and a jam trax cd and the jam trax is by far more professional. Every musician plays like he means it."
2,You had better be a purist ...,"These are probably very true, accurate, and terribly tuneless versions that were actually sung by sailors ... difficult to listen to and enjoy."
5,"An excellent, informative introduction to acupressure.","Acu-Yoga is a well-written introduction to the use of basic yoga techniques to stimulate acupuncture points throughout the body, acupressure. 13 years ago, I cracked a vertebra and have had chronic low back pain ever since. The spinal flexibility series (among others) in Mr. Reed's book helped me control the pain caused by muscle spasm and return to normal function within a few weeks. Acu-Yoga also provides information about the chakras, the organ meridians and the eight regulatory channels, and how these energetic systems work to restore and preserve internal balance. For someone who is interested in using gentle, self-paced exercise to relieve pain and improve in overall health and vitality, this is an excellent resource."
3,Moving biography,"From humble beginnings and through a lot of sacrifice and hard work, Jacques Pepin rose to fame. This great French chef tells his life story in The Apprentice. Through all his experiences, he managed to focus on this goal of learning and practicing the proper technique. Everything done in the kitchen requires skill and technique. His cooking brought him to the attention of rich and powerful people that require the world's best chefs. Pepin eventually became a TV success and author of several successful books. His life is an example of the charm and luck that good food can bring to us all."
1,Deceptive description,"This book is not ""Mere Christianity"", it is a guide to go along with it. Do not Purchase it thinking that you will get the text of the book ""Mere Christianity""."
3,good outline for class leader,"This is a cross between a commentary and a cliffs notes on Lewis' book. This is one of a series, apparently. Since the actual book ""Mere Christianity"" does not waste a lot of words on fluff, there really is no need for the notes part, but the restating of the themes in different words is helpful. It's a welcome companion especially for anyone leading a discussion class. Very inexpensive and brief. A helpful preview and review to each chapter as we read. Well worth the tiny price."
1,No Thank You,"I was so excited to find this, had my mom buy it, and then when I put it on I was instantly mortified that I looked like a bad imitation of Maddona's cone look. Not to mention the fact that it didn't hold me up at all. If you are on the bigger side then I would suggest finding something else!"
3,Good Attempt But This Music Wasn't Meant This Way,"This is a decent attempt to transcribe John Williams original work to the jazz setting and though it succeeds somewhat it always seems to be missing something. I think that has to do with the fact that an integral part of the Star Wars music is the large orchestra sound that it has. When it gets switched to a small jazz orchestra it just loses all of the feeling and power that the original music contains. Maybe this music would have been nice if I had never heard the original music but having heard it I always feel like it should be more powerful. All of that being said, this is still a must for any Star Wars fan, and is still a worthy piece of jazz."
5,Awesome resource,"This DVD is great for a small group or parenting class. I have also used segments in working with parents through special classes geared toward baptism and other milestone moments. Reggie and Andy are both entertaining, informative, and heartfelt with practical wisdom and memorable concepts."
3,Be Cool In Yourself,"This album really does have a ""cool"" sort of feel to it. I love track number 5. It get's me up on my feet everytime. The sound is good and instrumentals even better."
4,Family Tree Research,"Even though I could only obtain this on CD (due to crazy overpriced hardbound copies being somewhat rare), I LOVE having this for my family tree research and I am so glad to have found a copy in some format available! It really livened up my research having this available on CD. Although it has been updated by other Ellers since the original publication, it is definitely a valuable asset to anyone doing family tree research !"
5,Freaky!,"My name IS Caroline Renwick - I also have a brother called Marc! Renwick is a very unusual name outside the Scottish Borders. If Luanne Rice is reading this (!), why did you choose the name Renwick?"
2,Same old thing,This is not subtitled like it says above but in english with the exeption for the opening credits which are in Japanese but the opening is not subtitled. The main menu screen has a play all and scene access and contains the episodes 15-29. The episodes are the same as when it was played on its origenal airing in the us.
5,Great product,"Really nice product. If you like to have someone chop you or beat you with their hands when you have tight muscles, you'll like this product. It doesn't use as much energy as using your hands and arms and supplies the same results. It really works the kinks out. I've seen some reviews that said the bongos on irritate there sore spot, but I feel if you use them lightly they work great. You don't need to beat yourself with them. But overall I highly recommend this product for those of you that have muscle aches often. Either a partner can uses them or you can uses them on yourself."
1,Embarrassed,"I purchased this perfume in August 2011 as a birdday gift for a very special person. After I last saw her back in September I have not had any further conversation until today. I asked her how much she liked my gift, and to my surprise she said that the product did no seemed to be legit, the fragrance smell mostly like alcohol, that this perfume was not what she had used in the past. I finished the conversation and felt ashamed and embarased, I did not know that Amazon could sell something like my friend discribed to me."
3,Good evening scent,Provocative Woman is a good evening scent I think. Very sexy and classy. Like it. One of Elizabeth Arden's better scents.
3,OK I guess,"I bought this video card to increase my gaming expectations. At first, it was perfect since I could run everything on high quality. Now, however, this card is obsolete, and if u are looking for a good, yet cheap, gaming video card, DO NOT buy this one."
4,Squeaky comfort,"I love the way these things feel, the arch support is fantastic. The problem is that they squeak when I walk. They have a hard plastic arch - when that flexes, it creates just enough friction with the bottom of the shoe to make noise. Make that stop and these things are 5 star!"
3,I don't know that it is helpful,"I bought these because I have foot problems, if your feet are bad enough spend the money and go to a doctor first and see if the molds are better for you."
4,Spenco RX Orthotics,"They are working out just as expected. I would recommend them to anyone having arch problems. Also, you can't beat the price!"
2,Turn it down!,"Outside of a couple of tracks (most notably, a decent version of Secret Agent Man), this disk really isn't very good. It blares out at you and is obnoxious. Way too overdone and noisy. It's from a good genre, orchestral spy music, but it's far too bombastic. If you're looking for good loud spy-type music, I'd recommend Stereophonic Space Sound Unlimited's ""Fluid Soundbox"" over this."
1,Not Satisfied,"These breeches are very large about 2 sizes larger than the size stated so if you're ordering them keep that in mind, the brown is not a pretty brown and the waist is very high. Even though they are fleece, they are much blukier than other fleece breeces I have tried, so basically I sent them back and wouldn't reccomend them. I usually like tuff rider breeches and can order them online without trying them on, so I was pretty disapointed in this product."
3,"My toddler loves it, I've got mixed feelings","My toddler, 22 months, loves it. I on the other hand have the following two problems :1. The program requires the CD to be in the drive. It cannot be installed into the harddisk. This is a real nuisance. 2. Lengthy credits when you attempt to exit. This is ok in tv or cinema, but not for software.In other ways the program is quite slick, and hold the attention of its target audience."
1,Save your money,"Thankfully I bought this on clearance. You get what you pay for!The format & information on the disk is wonderful. My 2 yr old son loves the voices, bright colors & games. The problem is the disk program is terrible. It jams, skips & now the audio has quit! How sad for my son because it was his favorite. Shame on Disney for putting out such a piece of junk"
4,Another Twister Movie!,"Night of the Twisters is an excellent movie, cheaply done, but has all the necessities of a proper mother nature furry has her wrath! I was pleased to see that this movie did not blame global warming as the result of the cause of all the twisters. Acting was good, Step-father and step-son's relationship was beautifully developed in the movie. Anyone who loves these types of movies will not be disappointed."
3,Young boy tells of his experience with a tornado,"If you are teaching a weather unit, this is a must have video. Third to sixth graders love this movie. It pretty much follows the book which tells the story of Dan Hatch's experience in the tornados that hit his town. It is based on the tornados that hit Grand Island, NB. This movie can be integrated with writing activities and also in reading the book as a group or it is also a good read-aloud book."
4,Puppy Primer,I want a book to help with the adjustment of a new puppy and this works well for that purpose.
2,This is not the griddle you are looking for.,"I am not happy with this griddle. The plastic grease tray broke after only a couple weeks of use--not that it did any good. The griddle is surrounded by a plastic frame that has a gutter to catch the grease and allow it to drain. However, surface tension carries much of the grease right along the bottom of the metal surface and then drops it behind the plastic frame, leaving a nice pool of grease for you to clean up on your counter. This griddle is poorly designed and don't understand why others have ranked it so high."
1,Very Disappointed - Cheap Construction,When I received this item it was damaged - the cheap plastic frame had a four inch crack along the front edge and one of the rubber caps on the feet was missing. I don't know if the manufacturing standards have recently changed but I bought this item based on the good reviews submitted by other customers. I will be buying a griddle from a different manufacturer.
1,Inconsistant temperature,"Absolutely the worst. This heats up , you put your bacon on and it turns itself down, the bacon quits cooking. So you turn it up a little and it starts cooking, but then it lowers the temperature again. It takes 60 minutes to cook bacon. I complained to West Bend and they sent me a replacement. Its does exactly the same thing. Very disappointed."
5,RICER SUPREME,This the best ricer I have had the privilege to use. But best of all I don't have to give it back to my mother ormy grandmother. This is mine. I am looking forward to using it to make a fantastic SW Root Veggie Puree formy Thanksgiving Dinner.Jessie Tinling
1,Disappointed,I love cottage style with modern touches. I was really disappointed in this book. There are only a couple of pictures in this book that I liked. I usually love Better Homes and Garden books but this one I feel like they fell short on this one. I have seen better cottage style decorating in their magazines then in this book. I didn't get that WOW factor!
2,not smooth,"works for some grains, but not for flax seeds, which is why we bought it. they just slide around in the bowl."
2,Pestle Has Broken Twice,"We've had two of these. They look lovely and work well, but twice now our pestles have broken. I can't recall how the pestles broke (might have been dropped on tile), so it might not be an issue for others."
5,Great jew;ery for unbelievable prices,"jewelry has a handmade, ethnic feel. I love all things ordered, necklaces, bracelets. Prices are unbelievable. fast delivery.DE"
3,"interesting, off-beat","On this album, WGJB plays tunes not usually done in Dixieland style, but most of them work quite well. Yank Lawson's trumpet is in fine form, and Bud Freeman's tenor is shown to good advantage. In some ways this is almost a novelty collection, but it demonstrates the versatility of the Dixieland format. This is a disc for WGJB fanatics or those with a large traditional jazz collection."
5,My Girls Love It!,"My oldest daughter received this as a gift when she was three. She spent hours playing with all the dolls and all of their outfits. Five years later, my second daughter (who is now 4) pulled them. She loves them too! She spends so much time picking out costumes and dresses. And my 3 year old niece pulls them out every time she comes over. These are much nicer than the ones I had as a kid! No tabs! They stick with sticky tape that is easily replaced if needed. And the book has many different scenes to place the dolls in. Also there is a nice place in the back of the book to store all the pieces. They go in these little drawers and dressers and closets that fold back into the book and then close with velcro. They can get messy when the girls have every single piece spread out on the table, but they sure have fun!"
1,Wrong Phone Charger,"I ordered these phone chargers because the description said they were for my Cingular phone, only to find that they were not compatible with it. I sent the company an email telling them this and received no reply. I will not order from this company again."
1,Does not work with 8525 !,"this is the tag Listed under 8525 accessories."" BargainCell- 2 Piece Combo Of HTC Cingular 2125 8125 8525 PDA Smartphone Home/Wall/Travel + Car Battery Charger""(this is probably why the end tip of the cable was omitted on the picture)after moving one page forward to purchase it no longer mentions 8525just (2125, 8125 )How come no one caught this before me !"
2,Very disappointing,"This game starts out great but then is the flattest game/learning program I've ever scene. My 3 year old wants to see the characters, but after a brief introduction they are gone never to return and in their place is basically work sheets.Where is the imagination? Where is the creative use of the potential of the computer?One section, Goofy's car assembly, is the only mildly redeeming feature. But that's just not enough.Leave it on the shelf."
1,Very Disapointing,"This shampoo and conditioner were very drying. My hair felt like straw after using about half of the bottle. I would keep looking for another product, don't waste your money."
2,Not worth the cost.....,"I was very unhappy with this product. It dried my hair out badly which surprised me given the good reviews, back to Ojon."
3,Okay,"This shampoo smells great and gets hair really clean, but my only complaint is that it is really drying on hair. I used it today for the first time and it dried out my hair the same way Matrix amplify did. I am very disappointed. Maybe I need to use it more and my hair will get used to it? What I don't understand is my hairdresser uses it on me when she colors my hair and it never feels as dry as it does today. I really hope I am wrong about this product, I want to like it badly. If my hair is still dry after a months use I will go back to Redken Blonde Glam."
1,All The Worst,"Arthur Lyman was (and is) one of the most soulful and inventive jazz players around. Most of his music stands up well today, it was so far ahead of his time.Unfortunately for some reason -- possibly label pressure -- he also had occasional embarrassing pop songs on his albums, played for jokes or ""so awful it's funny"" collections. Well, this release (and that smelly Christmas release) collects all of the unfunny ""joke songs"" that he ever did, so if you want to wallow in debasement it's all here."

3,The Founding Fathers: An Examination of Conscience by Edward J. Melvin C.M.,"Description from the book jacket:A nation lives in the heart of its people. In the justice of its laws. In the vitality of its freedoms. In its self-control. In its dedication to true and noble principles. But the true test of its worth is to compare today's generation with the men who gave us our nation in 1776. Materially and in wealth we have grown far beyond the imagination of the founding generation. But are we a better nation? A better people? Has our progress been merely material, while our spirit has decayed? The Founding Fathers gave us a proud inheritance. Have we wasted it? Or have we made it grow?"
5,This book completely changed my life--literally!,"I first read this book 5 years ago, and still read bits and pieces of it often. I came across it at a time when I was ardently searching the spiritual landscape for something that made sense of the yearning I felt inside me. I devoured this book in 2 days, hardly understanding a word of it, and yet feeling like the answers to every unformed question in my heart had been revealed to me.The book is set up in short, one-page teachings from Andrew Cohen. Some are dialogues between him and others.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who is seeking, who is trying to find their way on the spiritual path. The depth of Andrew Cohen's understanding not only of the path's goal, but also of all the pitfalls and detours along the way, has saved me what I can only imagine would be lifetimes of work."
4,Best counter brush I can find,"This is a very good counter brush.It is made in USA, of very good quality materials.I wish it were the kind of fine horse hair and thick lacquer finish I remember on brushes years ago, but I can't find those brushes anymore.This brush is such a good one that I bought two, and gave one as a gift to a good friend who otherwise wouldn't know how to get one.This was my first Harper brand brush, but I doubt it will be my last."
5,Buy this!,"I bought this for my hubby and we both love it. The handle is very durable and the blade is wonderful. It isn't too lightweight, but the construction is great. Worth every penny."
4,over my head,This is a great single. Iwould suggest it to you with no regrets. I believe you will love it when you buy it and be able to write a revieve with great compliments. Your amazon friend.
3,Horn,Not as loud as I thought. Not bad but just not much louder then original. Perhaps installing 4 would be better. I still like the sound though.
5,Sound Great on my Hyundai,Arrived as promised very well packed. Came with all necessary items and extras if needed. Very easy to put in place at least on my car. Added an extra metal leave(plate) connected the wires and horns tied them up and presto. Had to do a minimal wire alteration but very simple. Hey! they sound great my wife loves them-better then the ones that came with the car.
2,A Boring score!,"It's seems like Dolores Claiborne, but there is no melodic. Dolores Caliborne is better. I'm very desapointed for this score. ''Main titles'' and ''End credits'' are quite good..."
4,The Big Chill meets The Anniversary Party,"The reunion of Minnesota's Darton Hall Class of 1969 isn't exactly picture perfect... With a host of colorful, yet heavily flawed characters, this book scrutinizes true love, friendship, tragedy and regret at all levels imaginable. A fun ride."
3,"Entertaining, but nothing special","Compared to past Tim O'Brien books, this one certainly falls short of excellent. I recommend almost any of his others over this one. But, it is an interesting twist on his typical material. There is still the obligatory O'Brien-Vietnam subplot, but he also invents many new characters all being faced with their childhood when they attend their college reunion 30-some-odd years later. They reminisce over lost loves and missed opportunities but with quite a sense of humor. It's very interesting, and I imagine moreso for anyone who is also approaching late-middle age."
2,Can't recommend,"I love Charles Brown, especially when accompanied by the sublime Danny Caron. However, this CD is a poor representation of their joint mastery. 4 of the tracks are less than 2 minutes, 3 are different versions of the same song & none shine with the usual Brown/Caron brilliance. Buy Someone To Love, On More For The Road, In a Grand Style, All My Life and skip this one."
5,Excellent tool,"For the finish carpenter, cabnet maker or like me a handy man.I had been using the plastic type of layout tool untill I ran into a job that had very wide handles, 160mm to be exact. And I had to layout each handle one at a time. This tool allows you to set it up once and go! Perfect mirror images on cupboard doors. Repeatability is a snap. A must have to install pull knobs and handles."
4,Lita Gets The Blues,"This album veers a little off the rock and roll highway on to blues avenue. Lita still serves up plently of rock-solid guitar that will ""wake the neighborhood."" I was most impressed with ""Joe"" and ""White Lightening."" Most true Lita fans will not be disapointed!"
3,Having a problem.,A few month after getting the Slo-Cooker the finish started peeling off where the handle is attached to the pot. I stopped using it because I did not want the non-stick finish to get into the food.
2,Bad Lining.... doesn't burn food,"I've had this crock for years. It was great at first - it seldom burns food and the lid fits very snugly. Its also not hideous to look at. However - DON'T drop it, and be fantastically careful about the lid. With mine, the teflon completely wore off the sides of the rim. Flaked off, so it may have made its way into some food, and in case you don't know, teflon is highly toxic. The crock tub is also very thin metal and obviously the target of cost-cutting. For a 50 dollar crock, I expect more. MUCH more. It is handy to cook in it on the stove top. But the peeling teflon rendered it unusable. Stainless steel may be better - most foods in the crock cook down and bleed their juices out anyway, so sticking concerns are overblown. Its temp control was very good. It hardly ever burned anything, even on high, which is really only meant for cooking things for an hour or two, tops, anyway. I had a ceramic crock before this and that burned EVERYTHING.But be wary."
5,Where has this been?,"Like several other Amazon.com reviewers, we had a West Bend slow cooker that is well over 30 years old with a base held together by duct tape until the heating unit finally came loose. We have not wanted to buy any of the numerous products that have glass inserts because they are not nearly as convenient for putting on the stove for rapid heating. Yet the West Bend that sits on a base is never seen in our area stores, so I had assumed that they no longer existed. I was delighted to see it on Amazon.com and am completely satisfied with the new one. Indeed, its oval shape and somewhat shallower design than our earlier one makes it easier to cook large items and the glass top is an improvement on the metal cover in our old one. Even if it lasts only half as long as our first one, it will have been well worth the money."
5,Transformed our lives,"My husband discovered this cooker, and after 43 years of marriage, is now cooking! He loves to find recipes, and create wonderful, intense, savory dishes. So it's doubly labor-saving (for me)! The food is wonderful. We usually start something in late afternoon, simmer it until bedtime, rest it outside in the winter cold until morning, remove the fat and slowly simmer it the next day. Once the weather warms, we will have to change our pattern, but it will still be wonderful."
5,meets my expectations,"I read all the reviews of slow cookers/ crock pots on amazon and elsewhere and this model seemed to consistently have the highest ratings. After using it several times, I am not disappointed! The ability to cook on the stove then place the pot on the slow cooker, then place leftovers in the refrigerator is amazing. The temperature controls seem accurate and clean up is easy with the nonstick cooking surface."
5,Best Chulent Maker,"If you want a delicious CHULENT ,try this slo-cooker,since we baught it -didnt miss it for a week and told many friends"
4,A good cooker with a flaw,"This slow cooker cooks well, just as the other reviewers have stated. It is easy to clean, too.But there is one very annoying flaw which is not apparent till one starts to use it: With its oval shape, the narrower ends can easily drop into the pot. Since this is something that doesn't happen with round lids, it came as a surprise. At first, I was amused by it, but then I got somewhat annoyed. One can take care so that the lid doesn't fall in, of course. But one may be surprised by how accustomed we are to round lids that don't fall into their pots, however hard one may try. So I ended up questioning the purpose of the oval shape. Anyhow, this is just my experience. Your milage may vary."
4,Good but a little hard to understand,I made the mistake of thinking this was just a biography on Juan Carlos but instead its a complex read on Spain during the dictatorship and how it became a democrarcy again. It was a good book and well written but a little difficult to understand.
4,A winner...full of great ideas!,"I have made four recipes from this book since purchasing it with a Christmas gift card. All four have gotten a request to ""make this again"" from my husband, which is very unusual...although, I'll admit, I'm no gourmet. This is Down-Home-Style food, and although many of the recipes call for convenience items (canned chicken, for example) I'm sure they can be modified when time permits.I'm dying to try several more in this book...they all sound so yummy! I can tell this book won't gather dust on my cookbook shelf. Other tips throughout the book on how to make plain staple foods more delectable.Very easy to follow, even for a kitchen beginner. The book also gives a ""Perfectly Prepared Pantry"" list to ease shopping, and a kitchen math list, which tells you how much raw product you need in order to end with a specific prepared amount.Definitely a winner!"
3,It's ok for the money...,"The doors seem to shut very loosely and leave a little space... The tray on the bottom is constantly sliding out when the dog moves around.. I come home to find the tray either half-way or all the way out, which forces my dog to lay on the crate underneath where the tray slides in... It can't be comfortsble in that circumstance. Other than that, it is easy to clean and I like the two doors.It makes it more versatile for positioning."
1,Looked nice and Arrived on time.,"Dog broke out of the cage from multiple areas. Tried using heavy duty tie wraps to stop her, but still not effective. My dog is 70 pound german sheperd mix. Gave up and it is now in the basement. I really need to throw it out. Does not work for my dog."
2,PUPPIES CAN ESCAPE!!,"My sister and I got puppies a little over a week ago. I initially thought these crates were great! At first, they were exactly what we needed....a place to put the puppies to sleep and keep when we aren't home. Well, after about 2 or 3 days, my sister's pup figured out how to unlatch the door and was getting out. After hearing a little squeek in the hall last night, I discovered that my puppy has now figured out how to get out of the crate, as well. These dogs are only 11 weeks old and can get themselves out. We will definitely have to come up with another solution for putting them up because this totally defeats the purpose of a crate! Wish I had something better to say. :("
3,Don't get what you pay for!,"Was easy to assemble but the crate door does not close well. In part, the problem is that this crate is made with very thin gauged metal frame and it simply does not have good structural integrity. Cost on Amazon.com is too high -- just saw it for much less at PetSmart today."
5,Perfect Dog Crate,My sheltie loves his new dog crate! We were able to upgrade from a carrier kennel to this crate. I really liked that it came with a handle and a divider panel. It was super easy to assemble and is a great value! My dog likes that he is able to look around while inside his crate. He likes it so much that he will jump off the bed during the night to sleep in his new space. I believe his crate is preferable to the 1 door version because the additional door allows for easy access even in very tight spaces. Great crate!
4,Be sure it is the right size,Bought the wrong size to match the end table crate top. Amazon made the return process much more easy than expected though. Kudos Amazon !
5,Amazing quality!!!,This company makes fantastic products! Very good quality and fast shipping too! I highly recommend their jewelry.
3,Unexpected,"Is it just me, or is this whole album about someone that Chris loved and lost? I almost can't listen to it because nearly every song seems to have that theme, with one or two exceptions... The loss is tragic and his articulation is poignant, but it's basically a self-expression album -- which is not necessarily a bad thing, but I've come to expect more from Chris Rice. If you want an album that points you toward meeting our Lord in glory, I suggest Andrew Peterson's _The Far Country_, which starts with scripture and relates it to the human condition, giving us hope for the future and joy for the here and now.I feel bad for saying that I didn't think it was that great; obviously there's some real soul-baring here, that perhaps doesn't deserve to be judged on a critical artistic level. Maybe it will speak to me more if (when) I lose someone closer to me."
1,The Truth about this Book,"The truth is, there's is no conclusive scientific evidence that ""super-slow"" training is as effective as standard periodization. Sorry, but that's reality. This book is simply wrong. Is there a reason why the top trainers and athletes don't use ""super-slow"" training? Yes: it doesn't work. Let me see, how many Olympic-caliber weight lifters use super-slow...how about NONE? If it sounds to good too be true...it is."
1,dident work,"only 1 side works at a time, so if only 1 side works kinda defeats the purpose of why i bought it"
5,Detailed account of the disappearance of Amelia Earhart,"Spring .. 1937. A specially prepared, ""State of the Art"" Electra L-10e twin engine aircraft. Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan attempting their flight around the world.A well detailed and documented book, by authors who worked with and know the limitations of the Electra L-10e. The exact route, written in a format easy to understand and follow. Amelia Earhart's disappearance has been researched by many, but Mr. Walter Roessler, Leo Gomez, and Gail Lynne Green have done an excellent job, if you ""Really"" want to know what happened in 1937."
3,Please stand by...,"This is a compilation of songs that appeared on Ernie Kovacs'TV show. I have never seen the show, so the songs don't mean as much to me as they would to somebody who is a fan of the show. Most of the songs are pretty weird, but only a few of them are out and out funny. If you are a fan of Ernie Kovacs you will probably like this CD. If you aren't a Kovacs fan, this CD will probably leave you baffled."
5,Bargain,"I had a cassette back in the day called Who's Better, Who's Best that I listened to a million times and have not seen in forever. Every track from that album is on here, plus about 15 more gems. I consider myself the Who's biggest casual fan, and intend to fully destroy every last air guitar I own playing along to this. A lot more tracks from Who's Next than is normally allotted to a Who package. If you're going to get a compilation, this one covers their whole career, and is awesome. It stomps any other collection I've seen. You'll still have to get Live at Leeds if you want to listen to what these guys were like. Lots of raw energy and killer music."
3,Ultimate....not really,"True, sound is clear and good on most tracks, but there's some serious problems:""I Can't Explain"", ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere"", ""My Generation"", ""The Kids Are Alright"", and ""A Legal Matter"", the Shel Talmy produced tracks are mono...they're in stereo on the recent ""My Generation"" 2-CD set.""Happy Jack"" and ""Call Me Lightning"" are, amazingly, the same tinny rechanneled tracks that first appeared on the lousy sounding 1967 UK Track LP, ""Direct Hits"". Why didn't Andy McKaie use the mono's????It would have be nice to (finally) get the unedited ""The Seeker"", but I guess we should be happy the single edit was included.Finally, though it's nice to get The Who's version of ""Let's See Action"", the fact that they left off ""Relay"", another mid-chart 1971/2 single ""A"" side, means that ""Relay"" is going to become something of a 'lost' hit.So even for the casual Who listener, this set, while good, is not ""ultimate""."
4,it was a great movie & I loved it!!,"It was the most coolest movie I have ever seen and it told god has not gave us a spirt of fear. TED DUFFY,"
3,good to watch it if you grew up in the late 60's or early 70's,thier is fun plots to this movie and it will get boring if you are not expecting the 60's era but is has some good parts to it and you want watch with the kids and show/tell them about this era if you can get past some of the boring parts
2,current dvd,I thought the movie was going to be a comedy obviously not/ the acting was good however actual vs preview was very different
2,Only 2 stars but not the movie,I gave this movie only two stars but it is the service that earned the stars not the movie. I never got to see the movie....I rented it for my wife and i to watch but we never got the chance....The rental was removed because there is a set amount of time Amazon will wait before taking your money and not let you watch it. I think it the time from is 2 weeks.....not sure why they limit that...if I paid the money let it sit in my library until i get the chance to watch.never will rent a money until we sit down to start watching it.....
3,A little disappointed,"I wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately all of the parts that I loved, I had already seen in the trailer. Still cute, but I was a little disappointed."
2,entertaining - maybe,"fell asleep so it's tough to give a true evaluation. However, I doubt I will give it a second try."
3,Very odd movie.,"I would not recommend this for children. We enjoyed it overall, but would not recommend to anyone other than for them to watch on a whim."
4,Better than I expected,"This movie surprised me. I loved the theme of ""worn tired love"" pitted against ""fresh first love"". It was sad, funny, and entertaining. I recommend it!"
4,Great little movie...,"Saw it at our local art house theatre. Bought it for my 8 and 11-year-old grandkids for Christmas. Other than one brief scene, I feel it's age appropriate and the kids will really enjoy it."
2,Pretty Good Movie but the streaming quality was horrible.,I liked the movie but the quality of the stream really diminished the experience for me considering this is a nice looking film its a real shame. I checked the internet connection on my end and was downloading around 10 Mbps at the time so that should have been more than suitable for HD so I am not sure what was wrong here.
2,One of those movies I fell asleep through....,To be honest with you I am not sure why we got this movie in the first place. It wasnt that good and I actually ended up falling asleep during it because it couldnt keep my attention.
3,Monrise Kingdom,"Its a quirky, sort of funy, odbal litle movie that you realy want to be beter than it is. if you really like stuff like ""the Full Monty"" or ""A Fish Called Wanda"" then maybe you wont quite be as disapointed as i was. bil muray just walks through his scenes as if he was stil playing the fake zombie in ""Zombieland"" and the rest of the cast is just too confusing to kep up with."
3,Meh,"A love story featuring 12 year olds. Kinda seemed like it was written by 12 year olds. Very nice cinematography though, and a fun cast."
3,Witty and fun but doesn’t quite close the deal,"I enjoyed this odd yet funny movie regarding the romance between two young misfits and their equally misfit parents and cast. I would give this 4 stars out of 7 but since I’m limited to 5, I’ll give it 3. The scenery and music are very artistic and engaging but the movie never draws me fully into the plot. The cute musical renditions during the final credits made me smile.I would recommend this to anyone how enjoys off beat romantic comedies such as Miramax created before Disney."
4,Classic Whimsy and Adventure,The best part of any Wes Anderson film is the supreme attention to detail. This one doesn't stray from that detailed atmosphere. It conjures up nostalgia for a place you've never been to.
3,Movie was entertaining and somewhat imaginative but a bit on the bizarre side...,"It was entertaining and ok, but just not cohesive enough t be excellent or great. I look at this as one of those movies that is entertaining but don't expect anything great. I wouldn't watch it again because it is nothing special.Worth watching, maybe, maybe not..."
2,Great ensemble cast,"I had high expectations but found it to be quirky, difficult to follow and uninteresting. It was a real disappointment. It was a waste of my time and the $3.99 rental fee."
3,Strange movie.,It's an OK movie. It is pretty far out. It isn't very credible. It was long time ago that we watched it.
3,"Not surprising, not particular great or awful","This was a lot like a lot of other movies. Quirky outsider kids, absurd grown-ups. Much like the Royal Tenenbaums or Life Aquatic. Other Wes Anderson movies are better. That isn't to say this was awful, and I watched the whole thing instead of turning it off, it just wasn't anything special."
2,waste of time,"just such a bad movie... don't waste your time watching this. The acting was bad, the story-line was inane and it tried too hard to be indy and cool, but it just pissed the mark altogether."
3,Goofy but Sweet,I found it watchable but it's been a while and I don't feel compelled to throw it into the Blue Ray player
2,Over my head or just boring?,"I was hopeful when viewing this movie because of the great cast lineup. But one-third into the movie, I started watching the clock. Never a good sign. By the two-thirds mark, I didn't care if I watched one more minute because the story was meandering and nothing was relatable. Very disappointed."
2,UGH!!!!,"What in the world? I attempted to watch this movie 3 times! I figured I must have missed something being that there were so many 5 star reviews! I found the characters annoying and the plot unbelievable. Sorry, just didn't do it for me. I was quite disappointed because I wasted so much time trying to get SOMETHING out of this movie...well that was like squeezing blood from a rock!"
5,A Charming unadorned story,What a surprise! An absolutely charming movie. The cast is excellent and the setting is simple and straight forward. It is more than a coming of age story. Two young people are finding friendship and respect in a world of dysfunctional adults. There is no overblown music and it is spare in presentation. It was a great find.
2,"Stellar cast, mediocre movie",I just can't fathom how any producer could persuade such a stellar cast to act in such a mediocre movie.
2,Not much happens,"All in all, not as good as his other works. Pretty boring sums it up. A little too weird for my tastes. I would pass on this one."
2,Disappointing,"Artsy-fartsy trifle with striking, pointless images,wooden acting, and a childish plot. Do not waste your time. Every time you think things will pick up, they do not."
4,Great Movie!,"I went into this movie expecting a lot and I was not disappointed. Moonrise Kingdom is a very imaginative and well written movie that despite the writers attempts I think is a ""feel good"" movie overall. I was hoping that Bill Murray would have a larger comedic role in the movie but he was not the focus of the film at all. Great movie, great comedy and a great overall message. It really makes me miss the good ol days and gives people some prospective."
1,Not very good,I fell asleep about halfway through while watching it ! I thought it would be better based on the other reviews
2,Kids Movie,"It's a movie for children and young teens. It's so corny that you can hear the corn popping. Plot is implausible, characters are cute but unconvincing."
5,Quirky and Intelligent and Heartwarming,"Moonrise Kingdom is a classic. It will rise to the status of cult film easily. The actors are perfect, the story is interesting and odd, the direction is unique. When I saw it at the movies I sat there with a stunned smile on my face the entire time - I could not believe my good fortune at watching such a treasure.BUY IT. WATCH IT. LOVE IT."
3,Glad I did not pay to see this in at the movies.,This was an ok movie. Full of quirky well paid characters. Great cast but It just never rose to the level of the hype.The script had just so so. It felt like eating a meal and feeling hungry immediately after.
4,Quirky and endearingly odd - a charmer,"We really enjoyed this film. It's odd, but in a really good way, in an endearing, sweet way. I like movies that don't fit an archetype or neat little predictable box. My 18 year old son son saw this in the theater this summer, and raved about it, so the rest of the family was eager to see it when it was released to DVD/Instant. Highly recommended."
1,Awful!!,"I'm sorry I rented this movie, if you can call it that. I've rented or watched films by this director a number of times and have found them to be weird/bizarre/stupid/pointless and poorly scripted and/or acted. Never again will I waste my time on such a movie."
1,Stupid,"I guess the producers wanted an arts-fartsy movie but this bordered on child pornography. It could have easily been a fun movie about children's antics such as Christmas Story, but instead acted out on ADD and other problems we would love to escape from. Not a prude, though I have standards--truth is I was in the middle of the ""business"" when I lived in S. Cal so I know of what I speak.Stay away from this and especially keep your children away from it."
4,Great Movie,This movie was so meticulously and beautifully shot. All of the little details of a Wes Anderson film that make them so great were preserved for me to revel in again and again and again...
3,Meager,"More abstract and more reserved than Anderson's other films, which are usually accessible and which usually contain elements of pop culture. This one just aspires to be art, and in particular aspires to be Godard's ""Pierrot Le Fou"". It imitates that film heavily, but with kids as the fatalistic couple rather than adults."
4,Classic Wes Anderson,Exactly what I expect and enjoy about a Wes Anderson flick. It was shot beautifully and I loved the quirkiness of the characters.
5,Charming!,"What a fun and charming way to spend a couple of entertainment hours! This movie I would find appropriate for all ages - did I say charming? ...and funny, artistic, and clever. I've watched it twice, and will probably see it again one day."
3,Entertaining,"Moonrise Kingdom is an Entertaining film, I didn't love it, but I enjoyed. It's Probably worth your time if you liked Wes Anderson's other films."
4,Not a Boy Scout,"I'm not a boy scout, nor was I raised in the 1960s. I did find this an entertaining depiction of both."
1,Can I have 45 minutes of my life back?!,"While I was expecting a quirky movie, and it is quirky to a fault as another reviewer mentioned, it felt like Saturday Night Live skit of an aging boomer's idealized memories that went on waaaay tooo loonnggg. I could only stomach 45 minutes."
4,Interesting movie,"This is one of those movies I had seen previews for all the time on TV and so I decided to go ahead and rent this movie to stream at home. It is a very interesting movie, but not quite what I was expecting it to be, but you definitely needed to keep watching to see how it would all end. I am all about quirky movies and this is definitely one of those movies with unique characters and storylines that you would only see in a movie like this, and for that reason I was a fan."
5,Great Wes Anderson movie,If you liked The Darjeeling Limited or The Life Aquatic you will not dislike this film. I thought the movie was very well put together.
5,Take Me Back in Time Wes...,"Wes Anderson movies always hit it out of the park. This movie takes us all back in time to the first person we fell in love with. Great performances by Bruce Willis, Fancis McDormat, Edward Norton, and Anderson stalwart Bill Murray. The kids are really the stars of the show and you will fall for them within the first 10 minutes. Great show!"
3,Weaker than Life Aquatic but acceptable if you enjoy this particular genre,"Weaker than Life Aquatic but acceptable if you enjoy this particular genre. It is all promise: I like the premises of the show, and continue hoping it will be a good ''installment''. It is not, but you will watch it because the style builds a certain loyalty. I like Bill Murray a lot, yet his part is minor and essentially not much in character. It's like saying, give some stars, because I still want Wes Anderson to make movies like that, only better."
2,Everything except the script,"Awesome set design, funny costumes, beautiful soundtrack, nice key turns from solid actors like Bill Murray...the only thing missing is a screenplay and direction that makes you give a damn about the story and people in it."
1,Poor quality - Not what I expected from Thompson Center,"Very low quality for a Thompson Center product:1. Very poor fit considering the rifle has very close tolerances. 1/4"" gaps between forend and frame.2. Plastic swivel stud is easily broken. Will not withstand a small bipod.I would not recommend this forend if you are concerned about either of the two items above."
4,Great center channel speaker!!,"Can finally hear movie dialog clearly now, am very pleased with this speaker. Upgraded from Mordaunt-Short Carnival Series, and while they are a great speaker, just no comparison because size really does matter imho. Speaker is huge though, so be prepared. It's not that heavy but does take some creativity if you need to place this above your flatscreen as I did. Coupled with M70s fronts, M40s surrounds, Onkyo HT-RC180, these speakers really rock the house & movies come alive in your viewing experience. Just tickles my ears!! Found this new for $112 on Polk's Ebay store. So glad I could finally get speakers to bring my music collection back to life!"
2,Not Helpful At All,"I'm a bit bewildered that this book has been highly rated by many readers. It left me absolutely flat. Aside from a reasonably good explanation of the vowels, I felt helpless with this book. The author's approach toward learning a language completely failed to connect with me. I was expecting to be led by the hand, and instead felt abandoned. I consider it a waste of money."
2,No Pronuciation Key or Appendix,"This book does take a slow, step by step approach to learning vowels and letters, but it lacks a key or appendix with a pronunciation guide. I found it hard to know whether or not I was reading or pronouncing the lessons correctly. This made using the book difficult and frustrating."
1,Sugar over salsa...and nothing new,"From all the hype, I thought this album would really be something new and special, but it's the same mindless beats played by computers and drab over-enhanced, studio sweetened vocals. Just what kind of hormone or technology does it take to make a grown man sound like an eleven-year-old boy? Wouldn't it be nice to hear a guy sing who actually sounds like a guy? There is just nothing real or subsantial here."
1,Saw this moron on CBS' Saturday Early Show...the worst,"It's been a long time since I heard such a ridiculously stupid performance. This guy sings is a falsetto voice and has absolutely no talent.I suspect young girls might like this moron, but it's just about the worst ""popular' thing I've heard in years.It's obvious that I'm not into to much of the hip, current scene, but this is the lowest."
5,Robin got it right this time,"I love this CD. They say music is the sound track to your life, well this is my life as I hear it."
5,Great cd before you know it your addicted,I bought this cd after seeing a video and wasn't sure exactly what to expect. After listening to the cd just once I was hooked. The more I listen the more I like it.
5,Oh my!,"Sexy and sensual....I love listening to Robin, and looking at him even better. This whole CD is amazing...time to start a Thicke collection.Love, love, love it. I might have to get another copy, so I can have one for the car, and work. My two favorite tracks are ""Lost without U"", and ""I need Love"". But the video for ""Lost with U"" is so hot, I sometimes have a hard time watching it, he's so sexy and good-looking: maybe it's the eyes, or maybe it's the way he strums the guitar, I don't know, but it definitely all good!"
5,Love It!!!,This album is refreshing and needed. Robin Thicke not only show great vocal ablity but range. The music arrangements have a classic yet contemporary feel. There were only two songs I wasn't ecstatic about. That says a lot since much of the music cd's today lack consistancy of good songs. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys music that is not recycled and/or cloned. Well done Robin!!!
1,POOR Quality,"the quality of the CD is HORRIBLE - when i tried to write the seller (2 different times) he never answered. I wasnt asking to return the product, just exchange"
4,Looking forward to more from Robin,"Not long after receiving the CD, I found myself singing several songs all day long! Yes, this drove me a little crazy, but it certainly does illustrate the powerful way he delivers his music. Some tracks were a little too urban for my taste, but I liked a majority of the songs a LOT! My favorites are, Ask Myself,Can U Believe, Lost Without U, Got 2 Be Down, Wanna Love U Girl, and 2 The Sky. Enjoy!!"
4,"""Worth the wait""",First of allI've been waiting for thisalbum for about a year....It was well worth the waitThe day of it's releaseI took my last few bucksand ran to my nearest Coconut'sWhen I put the disk inI was blown away by thefirst track feat.Faith EvansAll in all it's apretty good diskI just hope we don't haveto wait 3 years for the next release
4,nice but small,"This item is nice looking, seems quite durable, and does fold completly flat. I had to return it however because it was much smaller than I was expecting. It is a good size for draining the liquid from a can, but not big enough for pasta."
4,The first of two,"If you like the John Norman ""Gor"" books, then you will appreciate Savages of Gor and the story climaxing Blood Brothers of Gor. In this particular tale our hero goes to the land of the Red Savages. A section of Gor totally closed to whitemen, with the exception of a handful of traders. Experience the redman's heritage first hand, and you will come to understand what the term, ""noble indian"" really means. As usual John Norman does an excellent job with the detail and the characters. If you enjoy his writing style then this is a couple of books you'll definetly not want to hurry through. thanks"
4,DNA and Tradition: Ancient Hebrews,This is a great book with lots of information for anybody that wants to understand the concepts behind DNA and the link to the ancient Kohanim dynasty. The book is good for either neophytes or advanced individuals in the field of DNA that want a higher level of specific knowledge related to Cohen Modal Haplotype. The book further has a good linkage to the biblical versus that are the underpinning to the Kohanim group.
5,Simply put...,"Simply put, this is the best Star Trek episode that I have ever seen, and I have seen the majority of them. Flawless, brilliant, and cutting, this is the best of DS9, and the best of Trek. Those five stars are not enough for this episode."
4,WildCard,"Cannot put down, holds you till the end..showing the ill effects of mistakes in research and the innocent victims. Ya would recommond."
2,boring book,Very boring. I read it to the end but thought that it would never end. Not my type of book. Dont know if this author has other books but I guess I will give another a try.
1,Stock western with nothing innovative,"Trevanian has taken the western genre and simply re-enacted the age old themes with nothing really interesting or unique. Young drifting youth with troubled past enters one horse town terrorized by insane ex-con and his band of two. Simpathetic virgin girl and multi-ethnic whores, tuberculous gambler (Doc Holliday?), peg-legged bartender and even homosexual stable owners fill out the cast. Who do you think wins the stand-off? But it's not over. You have to find out the future of all the players and it is supposedly true. Sure. Skip this one and re-read Lonesome Dove."
1,Weird Western,"The book is just awful. I've read all the Trevanian books and it's very hard to believe that the man who wrote SHIBUMI and THE EIGER SANCTION wrote this drivel. It's possible Trevanian is a Brit with a strange fascination with the American West, as in THE LOO SANCTION, and still doesn't have it down yet. The historical boo-boo on page 50 illustrates that all the overused and tired cliches were one too many. (Buffalo nickels were not minted until 15 years after the story takes place.)The personal introduction and postscript don't add anything to the novel. Who cares how he got the story? None of the characters are enduring or endearing. This book was a waste of printer's ink and my time."
4,"Riveting, Genre-Twisting Exercise","Trevanian does it again, working within and subverting yet another classic literary genre, this time the venerable western, complete with the mysterious drifter, the outlaw, the shopkeeper, the Swedes, the preacher, the virginal maiden etc.What Trevanian does with these characters is superb, bringing the genre to the present and slyly lampooning the fundamentalist movement, the anti-immigrant militia movement, and presciently anticipating the tea partiers by at least a decade.A real treat from a master, though I'm still waiting for the next ""sanction."""
1,This cannot be the same Trevanian from 15 years ago.,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I picked this book up. I had thought initially that I missed one along the lines somewhere. After fifteen years, finally! Another book by a favorite author.Alas, as fond as I am of Shibumi and of historical lore, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this flat, boring, juvenile western. Unfortunately, Mr. Whatshisname (I can no longer voice it) has forgotten his own style and depth of character and story telling. Unfortunately again, my favorite chapter was the last one describing the research and historical fact.Bummer."
1,Self-righteous stereotyping and not much else,"What were the critics thinking when they praised this book? Were they warned that ""only smart people"" would see the supposed intricacy and hidden sophistication?At the end of the book, it seems that Trevanian did a lot of research, but for what? All we get is a barrelful of stereotypes, a politically correct western with no memorable, inspiring or profound writing."
2,Overpriced and unreliable.,"I bought this toaster about one year ago, it's dead.We used it quite a bit and enjoyed it for the first 6 months. The musical part of it started dying about three months in and then the toasting wouldn't work well unless it was turned all the way up after about 6 months. Now after a year the handle to pull down the toast to begin toasting has broken. Rendered useless after one year, waste of money."
2,Goldsmith's PATTON - Royal Scottish National Orchestra,"If you're hunting for the PATTON score you know and love, this ain't it. Good music, as it goes, but lacks the energy and clarity of the theatrical release soundtrack. Without the pivotal opening speech delivered by George C. Scott, it just ain't the same. If you are not familiar with the theater score, this recording may suffice. In the same vein (not having possession of the theatrical release soundtrack for comparative value, so not knowing any better), I can say that I did enjoy the TORA, TORA, TORA score."
2,Patton (1970 Film): Also Featuring Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970 Film) (1997 Studio Recording),"This is a great composition, but this recording is so quiet that one needs to turn the volume up all the way to heat the music at an appreciable level."
4,Great Series of knives,Just had to continue to complete series of knives. This is great for small chores in the Kitchen. My wife loves it.
5,A spy movie for kids that actually teaches the Bible,"RSTC is possibly one of the most unique films for kids I have seen in a long time. It's not preachy but you can't watch the movie without taking the scripture out of it. A lot of Christian films for kids will have a scriptural principle that is taught, and then at the end maybe they'll teach the verse it came from. RSTC is different: you watch Liz go through a trying experience and the only way she can get through it is to use the scripture that is taught in the movie. I have several friends whose kids have watched this movie over and over again, and they love it every time. And I can't help but think that when they get into a situation where they are afraid, they'll know that ""God has not given me a spirit of fear!"""
3,W.I.T.C.H.book #2 : The dissapearence,"This book was not to exciting but I liked it anyways.Elyon has gone missing.Will discovers that she can talk to appliances and electronics.At school the next day Haylin saddly discovers that her Grandmother has died.At the chinese funeral while Haylin is hugging Will she sees Elyon in a ghost like form.The next day at school Will,Irma,Taranee,Cornelia and Haylin see the ghost like Elyon again only this time she is asking them to come with her.When Mrs. Knickerbocker is not looking they follow her through buildings with the help of Cornelia.They follow her to her basement where she was waiting with Vathek and Prince Phobos.The girls closed the portal but afterwards they found a mysteries book that they could not open.For more about that read book #3.Plus I forgot to mention that Elyon got away with the others.For more detail,excitement and adventure read the book."
3,The Good Husband,I thought the book could have been written less wordy. There seemed to be flat characters who didn't even fit within the story well. The literary references were too abundant.
5,Someday - CD Single (1),"Someday! CD Single!Ok, This one is one of the best of Hers (Altought it only has 5 tracks)1) Someday: A very soft and sweety ballad, like Everytime, Britney express herself in here.2) Chaotic: Oh, a Britney-Pop song! Very Cool and so Chaotic.3) Mona lisa: Like somebody said, a witchy song, very funny, BUT! I think that the 2004 version of mona lisa is better. But This one is pretty cool4) Over To You Now: What Can I say!? it's one of the best! I like much more than Toxic. It's a Damn Cool Dance Song, To dance and dance and dance and dance! yeah! and Right now i'm listening to it, hahaha5) Someday Hi Bias Remix: Hum! Very cool, a pretty remix of someday, i think that it's better than the Leama & Moor and the Jared Jones Remixes, on the other CD SINGLE of Someday.This album its so cool, so BUY IT, You don't have regrets!See ya."
2,"charms, spells, and formulas","It is a introduction into spells. Contains alot of Catholic beliefs and traditions, and the book contains no potions what so ever."
2,"wasn't bad, but hard to understand","I was just skimming the book, and unless you read the entire thing, most of it doesn't make sense. I'm sure if you just look at the spells, sure they're alright, but I've been doing witchcraft for over a year now, and a lot of the spells I've seen before."
1,"this is not Vodou,","this book is for any magician no matter their religious practice, and i think this is a great little spell book which does contain many formulas for things like incense, washes,oils, and powders , and teaches how to make gris gris bags, and use dolls in magic . but this is not Vodou, Vodou is a practice that deals with spirits called loas, loas are the spiritual force in Vodou they are the workers behind Vodou magick but this doesn't involve the loa's so it is NOT Vodou"
4,Excellent coverage of graduate level electromagnetic theory,"This is a wonderful book that focuses more on physics than on the mathematical techniques. It is one of the few books still in print to deal with topics like a) stresses in fluids and solids due to external electromagnetic fields, b) Maxwell equations in moving media in the non-relativistic case or c) use of complex variables in solving potential problems.Unlike Jackson's book that promises to prepare the reader to handle research problems in theoretical physics by teaching the necessary mathematical methods, Panofsky and Phillips focus on electromagnetism alone and do a wonderful job.I think this is a good graduate level book and if read with its contemporaries like Stratton's Electromagnetic Theory or Smythe's Static and Dynamic Electricity, it can provide a formidable foundation in the subject."
2,"Miike's ""Neverending Story""","Only the second Miike film I could make it all of the way through, I doubt that I could watch THE GREAT YOKAI WAR again. Instead, I think I'll rent THE NEVERENDING STORY in the near future as Miike's flick seemed highly reminiscent of this kid's movie. Apart from a few moments of self-reflexivity, I didn't find much to entertain me in this bizarre monster movie. I can see enjoying it more if I were a few decades younger but, as a 33 year old, I was rather nonplussed by this drawn out classic good versus evil / messiah tale. The effects were good, especially the make-up effects, and the little kid lead (Ryunosuke Kamiki) didn't annoy me. 'Nuff said."
1,poor.,"This album is not worth your money or your time. The only decent song is the first track, all the other are just imitations of it. I'll admit that I'm pretty picky about my disco music, this one doesn't measure up."
5,bird feeder,"i have tried many...this really works to keep the squirrels away...it can be adjusted for different weights of birds, so i dont have mourning doves and grackles and heavy birds coming to it...easy to fill...i mounted it on a post against the far side of a big deck."
2,Not Squirrel Proof,Bought this a few months ago. I'm back shopping for another bird feeder because this one is NOT squirrel proof. They jump on the roof and hang upside down to get to the seed.
5,Best Bird Feeder Ever,"I have tried 6 bird feeders trying to find one that was rugged, held a lot of bird seed, and one which had minimal ""wastage"" (birds being able to grind out and scatter seed with their wings, bills, etc.). This bird feeder excelled in every category and will pay back it's cost in saved bird seed in about 3 months.We don't have a squirrel problem, so I can't evaluate this feature; however, I did test it just for grins and it seems to work fine."
2,Squirrel Proof?,We've had this feeder for a while and watched how the squirrels twisted their bodies to out smart the feeder. And the sensitivity of the bar doesn't allow for Blue Jays to stay and feed. We give up!
1,Romantic Journey by Stephanie Howard,"When I ordered the book Romantic Journey by Linda Howard, I received Romantic Journey by Stephanie Howard."
1,Jack the Bookless,"Only by skipping entire pages was I able to finish this book. Very little happens. All the story revolves around the Remillard family and it makes you long for some contact with the rest of humanity. Also, the Remillard family's powers are poorly described and used. For exemple, all telepathic conversations could have been held with cell phones without any differences. Finally, aliens seem dissonant, just there to frame the story in an artificial set of rules."
4,"Beautiful puzzle, does not contain all of the newer info","We did this for a 5th grade science project. Be warned, this puzzle still includes Pluto as the ninth planet, and does not include Eris, which may or may not be considered a planet, depending on who you ask. We solved the problem by printing out a picture of Eris, then cut it out and pasted it onto the puzzle. Other than that, it is a great puzzle and we had a lot of fun putting it together!"
1,"No thank you, Mrs. Cleaver","Another classic sitcom falls victim to Hollywood hacks, as an unremarkable cast struggles with a dreadful screenplay. The only surprise here is that Penelope Spheeris wasn't tapped to direct, as this sort of project seems to be her specialty. However, Andy Cadiff shows that he is just as skilled as Spheeris at creating an uninteresting, unfunny, and unworthy feature version of a classic sitcom. Stick to the TV re-runs."
1,"No, Beaver, Just Leave It!","Fans of the original sitcom will find this sorry little film to be an outright disaster. The premise is silly, the script is dreadful, the acting is deplorable, and director Andy Cadiff clearly does not know what he is doing. Stick with the original series, which is light-years ahead of this piece of junk. ""Hey, Gilbert, let's take this crummy movie over to Metzger's Field and bury it."" ""Gee, I don't know, Beav - I don't think it's worth burying - let's burn it."""
4,Groovy Movie,"Okay, YUP-it's corny. HELLO-its based on a very popular show from the 50s and 60s, which I happen to love. Forgive the cheese factor every once in awhile and enjoy this family film!"
4,Good product,I really kike it. My nephew played with it a lot and it is his best yoy. He hugs it all the time.Jen wan ming liu bengtsson ben pers kim.
2,Depressing,"I disliked the movie. It has some funny parts, but most of the movie shows a family being ripped apart and torn into shreds."
2,Some kind of politically-correct morality play?,"OK, so the guy's a jerk, but in the end he accepts his wife's female lover as part of the family --- sounds like a new Disney movie to me!Actually, Josiane Balasko did a decent job directing this film, but casting herself as the truck-driving lesbian was a bit too much! Yes, it was realistic --- but therein lies the problem! Visually, I'd have much rather seen a hot-looking, sexy, dark-haired woman seducing the beautiful Victoria Abril. I mean, to put it a different way: beautiful bodies a more enjoyable film do make!"
1,Disappointed with quality of printing,"I bought this as a gift for my boss. I thought the subject was very interesting and bought it based on the positive reviews of other readers. When I received it, I was very disappointed by the quality of the printing. It looked like someone photo-copied it. I expected a $12 paperback to have a more professional look. Needless to say, I won't be giving it as a gift.Mind you, I am not judging the quality of the writing. Since I know nothing about children or accupressure, I am not qualified to rate that."
4,good but missing some songs,"First off, to the person who was asking about the music with the harmonica that aired twice in the movie, that was a clip of Tom Petty's ""You Don't Know How It Feels"" from 1994's ""Wildflowers"" CD.The CD is good, but it does leave songs out, such as the above-mentioned song. I love the new music, but perhaps soundtracks will sell better than they do when they aren't used just as a tool to promote new or current artists. That being said, this soundtrack is much better than some recent soundtracks, such as ""American Pie 2"" which left out two of the most prominently featured songs from the movie (Offspring's ""Want You Bad"" and Alien Ant Farm's ""Smooth Criminal). So, buy this CD if you want to hear the tracks from groups like Lit, Weezer, and Counting Crows, but not if you want to hear songs from older artists that were in the film."
1,Too small,"whens the last time a contractor actually carried a #2 pencil? I only use the wide flat pencils or sharpie markers which this holder will NOT hold, the pockets are way too small/narrow. gave it to goodwill"
5,A must have collection,"I bought the album version of this collection when it was first published. Tommy Makem's style is unique and exciting. He, along with the Clancy Brothers, was instrumental to introducing Irish folk music to America but also for collecting and saving many of these songs which would have been forgotten but for them. There are several songs on this album which are inhabited by Mr. Makem and are signature songs, never sung by anyone else with as much verve and style: Butcher Boy, Balinderry, The Little Beggarman and the wonderful Bold O'Donohue. The only one of his ""personal"" songs missing is ""Whistling Gypsy Rover."" I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys traditional Irish music with the life and personality unmatched by anyone else."
5,great tunes great singing,"less commercial that some, these songs avoid the ""saint patrick day"" slant of some offerings that pretent to be folk songs. these are the real mccoy"
3,Do not be so convinced,This book is indispensable only because professors require it in their classes. I do not think though it is well written at all. It gives the impression of being written late at night when the authors really did not want to be writting.I am afraid it may be the only book on Spectrochemical Methods that is general enough to cover many aspects of many different instruments.I am going to try to find a different one before I settle on this cryptic text.
4,Evenhanded documentary,"Worth viewing. Makes you hopeful for a culture who is trying to shake off the Islamofascist yoke, yet still allow for non-violent Islamic sects to worship.Afghans shook off the Soviets, so the ability is there...."
5,great bobbin and thread holder,i bought one of these last year for my daughter-in-law and she loved it.i got into a quilting project and it is great
2,Cheesey sewing box,"This is not a very good sewing box. The spools of thread constantly fall out if the thin paper separator is not placed over the spools. I don't think the flimsy paper separator is going to last very long, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do at that point to keep the spools in place. I should have returned this item immediately after receiving it. Because I'm a procrastinator, I'm stuck with this piece of cr@%! I feel I paid $22 too much for this cheesey sewing box. Do not waste your money on this."
2,not what I thought would be,when I first opened this product the thread was not on the spokes and will not stay. The items inside were not quality and the pin cushion was way too small..really disappointed with this item and would not recommend to others as the stuff in the side compartments are hard to get out because the way they open........
3,Lots of extras for the price,Lots of extras for the price. The case is solid and closes easily. It's better than I though it would be for the price.
5,Singer Sewing Essentials,It has everything I need for my sewing machine. It has all the basic color of threads. I'd recommend it for all basic sewing needs.
2,Not durable,"The closing button broke after a month of use, and I seldom use it!It looked good in theory, but I am already looking for a replacement, it is uncomfortable to use, and the threads keep falling out, no matter how tight I try to push them."
3,Great for beginner,"I just recently started sewing again, and thought this would be a nice little item to have, it has all the things you would need for sewing. There are plenty of threads, in lots of different colors. It does have several storage areas, and all the basics. Some of the items are small, but for the beginner they are very good. I ended up taking out what I would use, and putting the box up on the cupboard. It would be very handy if you were going to attend a class for sewing, you could have everything in one spot. There is even a pocket to hold the patterns. So after looking at it, for me, its not exactly what I was looking for, but for some one just starting out, it would be perfect. It would be a great gift for the beginner seamstress."
1,Poor quality,"Low quality thread, low quality tools, low quality case. On three days of light use one of the arms broke off. After a few weeks one of the large sides broke off.The spools are always falling out no matter how well I stick them on. This didn't end up being worth the money. Maybe for a young starting newbie. I was getting back into sewing and had managed to misplace a lot of my tools in a move. Wanted to kick-start my new set and ended up buying all new tools on top of this."
2,Boring....,"...this is a pretty dull performance. There are just too many LONG passages where Jarrett is indulging in nothing more than mindless key twiddling, waiting for the muses to inspire, which they do all too infrequently. Just when you think he's reached his stride, he gives out like a dead battery. The Koln concert remains Jarrett's definitve solo performance. And yes, I know it's a Keith Jarrett hallmark, but the frequent crying out is distracting and obnoxious. This CD is just okay in a New Age sort of way, but I'm glad I didn't buy it. (Thank God for libraries.)"
1,ShowCo and Clair Brothers Promo Book,"Please, Please do NOT buy this book! I bought it just as I was starting my first FOH sound engineering position. Don't be fooled, there are absolutely no tips in this book. It does not in any way help a new or longtime sound guy. The only suggestion in the entire book was that a tube compressor might sound good on drums and I just told you about that. The rest of the book is just promoting ShowCo and Clair Brothers sound companies. Put your money into anything but this. Honestly, this is the first book I have ever thrown away after reading it!!!!!"
5,This book is an 11.,Clive Young really captures the behind the scenes challenges faced by the audio engineers of your favorite music acts.Young's writing is enjoyable and informative.For someone who doesn't know a woofer from tweeter I found it a fascinating peek behind the musical curtain.Anyone interested in this facet of the music industry should get it!
5,A must have!,"Anyone in the music industry, or planning on it, must get this book! This book is absolutely riveting and well written. Makes me want to go on tour!"
3,Living Sacrifice - 'Reborn' (Tooth And Nail Records),"'Reborn' looks to be the fourth effort from this Little Rock,Arkansas metal/grind core band.It should also be noted that guitarist Bruce Fitzhugh has taken over the lead vocals.Some semi-impressive cuts to turn your stereo volume to 'ten' are the blistering opener ""Reborn Empowered"",""Awakening"",""Sell Out"" and ""Liar"".Might be too heavy for some.Check this CD out at your own risk."
4,Empowered indeed,"A definite change of style for the mighty Living Sacrifice. With the loss of the band's founding member, vocalist and bass player DJ, Living Sacrifice has traded in their raging, technical, most excellent metal for a hybrid hard-core that is bringing new a new set of fans. This album is excellent. The guitars are very rythmic on this album. The drumming isn't as technical as in previous albums, but still very, very tight. The vocals are quite differnt this time. Guitarist and vocalist, Bruce Fitzhugh projects his throaty screams with ease. Once again dripping with the proclamation of their Christian beleifs, the lyrics are superb. Old schoolers will cut their hair when hard-core kids make them aware.El Kabong gives it four head bangs."
5,Supreme,I really enjoy this album. It's just awesome. The words of the songs are amazing also. They really spoke and ministered to me. It has a great annointing. God bless these guys.
3,Too much for too little,"it has great content, but over 10 dollars for 56 pages of material? I wouldn't have paid this much If I had paid attention to how pages there were."
3,"Was originally a pamphlet, could have stayed that way.","This is an interesting book in that it explores guerilla war from a philisophical aspect (not tactical or technical). As usual the info in these sort of manuals is old yet still relevant. The problem that I have with the book is that it very repetative. I believe the repetion is on purpose and intended for emphasis, but the redundancy may also fill the book out a bit. The book was published originally as a pamphlet and was later expanded, thus some of the tedious repetition. I still enjoyed reading this book and consider it an interesting addition to my collection. Anything by The Chairman Mao is bound to raise eyebrows when seen on your bookshelf. A good conversation piece if nothing else."
4,Great McQueen vehicle,"Director Sam Peckinpah prepared this production and was set to begin filming it when he had one of his famous fallings-out with a studio, and Norman Jewison had to pull it out of the fire. It's a great job, dominated by McQueen, Robinson, and Ann-Margaret, who gives the sexiest performance I've ever seen in a movie, bar none. A little poker knowledge will go a long way in helping a viewer make sense of the climactic scenes."
2,The best songs are missing on this soundtrack CD,"They recently brought 1941 on television. I just turned on when there were three women singing in the tradition of the Andrews Sisters. Even though the action of the movie did not grab me it was the music that kept me watching. The singing and the orchestral music they played in the ballroom of the U.S.O. was so great I wanted it in CD quality. After buying this CD I was very disappointed to find that all of the songs by the singing women, especially ""Down by the Ohio"", were missing.With only 38 minutes of music on the CD only half of the capacity is used. Absolutely not understandable they omitted the best tracks! This disc might be all right for the person looking for John Williams instrumental music only. For somebody who wants a CD worthy being called ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" it is not complete and cannot be recommended."
4,Great Little DVD Player,"This little DVD player is just the thing for taking to the gym. It fits on the rack of any exercise machine. I plug in my headphones, start the movie, and run. Sometimes I run an extra 10 minutes just to finish the movie I'm watching. Afterwards, I just slip it into my gym bag. The battery has been lasting close to 3 hours. However, when I bought it, the charger it come with didn't work. I did have to buy my own charger at Radio Shack. I've been using it for 6 months now."
2,disappointing,"After reading many wonderful reviews of this book, I was surprised to be disappointed by the content. Although some of the information about basic personality styles was useful and interesting, overall I felt the information was cliched and would not be particularly useful to me in my writing. I also was put off by the author's know-it-all tone that pervaded the book. She included real-life cases of people whom she had seen as therapy clients in a tone that communicated amusement at their struggles. The most useful part of this book to me was the glossary in the back."
2,Save your money,"This is not such a bad book, but the character information, with some exceptions is pretty useless. If you are an amateur writer you can skip this book, mostly because the data is completely stereotypical and lack the little details that are so important for developing ""tasty"" characters. The career analisis part is somewhat useful but very limited. Remember that it can be a lot worse for a writer to fall in extreme stereotypes than to skip some minor career characteristics."
2,Not worth the money,"I found this book really odd -- I was most interested in the character traits of certain professions, but found really odd ones are missing (ie, actor?). I also found the approach to developing characters really simplistic, just a list of bullet points and not much on how the different traits might interact or manifest in action and thought. I was hoping for a reference, I got an incomplete mishmash of one person's opinions instead."
4,My husband likes it too!,"Not only have i truly enjoyed it , i have been blessed to share it in devotion whom is a over the road truck driver. I would recommend it to all women who r seriously seeking God's face. Thank you women of faith for such an excellent bible companion ."
1,Brings the concept of God into drivel about getting a PT Cruiser!,"How absolutely assinine this book could get at times is beyond me....to quote the Bible like some fundamentalist zealot, claiming GOD made/caused a better deal on an Oldsmobile rather than a PT Cruiser is childish drivel and not worthy of publication. If fundamentalists would spend MORE time helping out fellow mankind than attributing serendipitous coincidences of daily life to some mystical ""God"" intervention, the world would be a better place to live. Save your money---go put your religion to work and volunteer to help feed the homeless or a family in need and give them the money you'd have spent on this book. Sheesh! How embarrassing for women in general!"
3,Works fine,"This pail is pretty good because it doesnt require special bags or anything. I have only replaced the filter once in over a year. I have no idea what the filter actually does, but my daughter's room doesn't smell like poo, so it must be doing its job."
1,To buy? or not to buy?,I don't know why I even bother to purchase this product. My diaper genie still smells bad whether I put new filter in or not.
3,Borderline--the book and the personality,"Two parts to this review--first, the book itself: it was interesting and a quick read, but at times tedious in its detail--do I really care how many inches Sylvia grew in her first year? It is, which I suppose is not surprising, somewhat overly sympathetic to its subject, Miss Plath, who I found quite honestly to be dislikable and tiresome for the most part. I'm sorry her father died when she was eight, but was irritated at the frequency which this was referred to as a root of her problems.Second, does Sylvia strike anyone else as more borderline personality than depressive? The intense stormy relationships, the hypersensitivity to criticism, impulsivity and unstable sense of self--I couldn't get the diagnosis of BPD out of my mind throughout."
4,Turn it up!,"I firmly believe that Taiko drumming is not something one can capture on a recording. It must be heard and FELT live. However, as far as recordings go, this one has a good feel. I also believe the recording technique used for this cd was intentional on the part of the makers--it forces you to turn the volume up to a level which can allow you to appricate the drumming's effect. Traditionally, the softer lower-volume parts are intended to offset the louder parts. Also, the silent gaps are very important and should be appriciated, which is something Westerners are often unused to. I feel this recording is true to the nature of the art."
2,"Artistically: excellent, Technically: horrendous","The CD liner contains the following notice: ""This disc contains music of extraordinarily wide dynamic range, encompassing long passages at the threshold of audibility that build to levels of extreme intensity."" This caution must have been intended to address the pitiful engineering of this CD. The actual dynamic range of the entire CD is remarkably narrow. Track 5 for example is almost completely inaudible, even at maximum volume. (My personally ""remastered"" version of track 5 sounds fine - after 980% amplification)."
1,Amazingly bad,"Worst composition, sound quality, etc. of any CD I have ever had the misfortune to listen to. The other one (cherry pink) is pretty good."
2,Carolina,"I was disappointed with this film, I usually enjoy Julia Stiles work however I found this film to be both crude and depressing. Needless to say it'll not find a permanent home in my collection."
3,Lush modernisation of classic,A lush modern take on the Henry James novel Wings of the Dove. Joely Richardson and Aden Young create enough chemistry to believe their feelings for each other. Beautiful to watch and enagaging enough to keep your interest. Aden Young deserves his career to rocket.
3,Interesting historical summary of the superstitious and religious origins of Halloween.,"This is a pretty interesting book from years ago that gives a detailed history in simple terms of the Halloween holiday. It is simply illustrated and traces the history of Halloween from before Jesus until today, along with all of its customs. It teaches the reader of the ancient pagan superstitions involving fear of the dead with the ancient Celts, and how it mixed with religious beliefs involving all Souls Day, appeasing the spirits on that day and related days, and finally to cross the oceans with the Irish, to the United States. It ends on a happy note with Trick or Treating for UNICEF. The book is worth having for a simple history of Halloween."
5,"This book is full of great stories for kids, ages 1-100","This book, written by Lyman Frank Baum, author of The Wizard of Oz and many other Oz books is possibly his greatest work ever. Everyone should read this classic book of American fairy tales"
1,Major Moisture Problems,"EDIT: I had to completely change my review based on some major moisture problems that this feeder has. I really enjoyed this feeder when I got it, does a good job keeping the squirrels out and the fact that it holds a lot of seeds is a plus. I have only had this feeder for about 3 and a half months and the 4 bottom seed ports are filled with moisture and mold. The feeder is currently hanging on a covered deck so I have no idea how it attracted such moisture other than some flaw in the design. I am going to attempt to take the entire feeder apart to get out the disgusting mold (that looks like human hair??), worms, and caked up seed. I am tempted to throw the feeder in the garbage because it's so disgusting but it was majorly expensive! Not to mention all of the good seed in the top will probably need to be thrown out, what a waste!"
4,bo jackson raiders jersey w/o the raiders logo,Jersey is as described. Material is made of good quality. Stitching is also surprisingly good quality (doesn't look like cheap patch work for some cheaper jerseys being sold on amzn). Just be aware that there is no Raiders team logo anywhere on the jersey; instead there is a Reebok logo on both sides of the sleeves above the #34. There is however an NFL logo in the center collar.
4,Great Book!,Jillian tells it like it is. She doesn't promise you anything and is very straight forward about her program. I enjoyed reading this book and I am about to start the program. It also gives a few recipes as well.
4,Winning book,I figured this would be another book I would read over and then it would collect dust but it is actually very helpful. What I like most about this book is Jillian's realistic attitude about weight loss. She writes like she speaks and it contains some very good information. It helped me get motivated.
4,Great Book,"Great, straight forward book. I am following her diet based on the theory of whether you are a balanced, fast or slow oxidzer and I think she is on to something...I have lost weight, feel better and feel fuller longer following her suggestions. I also liked that workout section of the book because she included pictures and advanced moves for some the exercises. Would totally recommend."
5,Motivating,"I've only started reading the first two chapters of this book, and already I find myself considering new possibilities about how I view myself and food!Winning by Losing is 3 books in one. It covers diet and exercise, but it also teaches you how to get your mind and heart in order. This book is about changing the way you look at yourself, why you want to lose weight, what you expect to happen when you reach your goal, what are you willing to do to make that happen. Bottom line... Jillian covers all the bases, educates, and inspires you to be the best you that you can be."
5,No nonsense - Have to work to lose weight,"I love this book. Jillian is straight forward and no-nonsense just like on the show. She won't accept excuses. You have to work hard to lose the weight and that's all there is to it. No quick fixes. I have already lost over ten pounds following her advice. Great book. I know I will keep the weight off this time because I've begun to look forward to exercise and miss it when I am unable to exercise. Also, fast food no longer tastes good to me. I prefer to cook my own food and know what's in it."
2,Very basic,"This booklet is very basic. No intro, no explanation of rational for information provide, just a list of actions to take with your dog. Even worse, I think much of this information is based on some outdated ideas and a belief that dogs behave just like wolves. To compound matters she simpifies (or misunderstands) wolf behave in such a way that her adivse is really not very useful. For example, I don't really think my dog wants on the couch because sitting on it is somehow a status symbol to her. She likes sitting on the couch because it is comfortable and she gets to be near her people."
2,Hard Long read,"Didn't impress us- hard to follow concept,much better books not booklets to learn from out their that are easier to apply. 3 paws down!"
1,Surprised and disappointed,"I bought the Kindle version of this book and was looking through it. When I got to page 15 I thought there was something wrong with the file, there were only 15 pages. I looked at the Amazon buying info and could not find how many pages the book contained. When I started reading the customer reviews I finally found out it was only 15 pages long. This is not a book, it is barely a pamphlet. I am very disappointed. I didn't find much, if any, useful information. I am particularly disappointed with Amazon. I feel they have an obligation to tell us what we are buying, and they certainly dropped the ball this time."
4,How to be the Leader of the Pack,"Only 15 pages long, this is more of a brochure than a book. The info is good with no fluff. May not be worth the cost w/ shipping."
3,How to be the Leader of the Pack,"The information in this book is good. I was disappointed when it arrived that it is little more than a brochure.She knows her stuff but this and her other ""short"" books could have been combined into one larger book and I would have been more satisfied. I would not recommend this book for purchase as you are paying approximately 75 cents a page. Check it out of the library."
4,"Nice, but something is missing....","The tracks to this album is absolutely wonderful, and although I have not bought the original album yet, I am familiar with the main theme. This album is not bad, but something is missing...I agree with the other reviews that it does kind of lack that intimate feeling when compared to the original soundtrack...maybe it's due to some of the track being so short! (48 seconds)"
1,"short read, short lived, short of expectations","this was a one sitting book, tedious with boring passages and a susceptible plot"
2,OK,"I found this book slow and plodding for the most part. Some interesting premises but not taken as far as they could be. If you're into suspense thrillers, read Kleier's THE LAST DAY--probably the best suspsense thriller I've ever read. Also, King's THE STAND is a classic."
4,Kellerman - Dr. Alex Delaware - What can I say?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Jonathan Kellerman's newest offering, ""Monster"".I may be biased in that I have been addicted to the Alex Delaware series from day one, however I found this storyline to be extremely interesting.Oddly, I found myself feeling much the same emotionally as when I saw ""King Kong"" or even ""Frankenstein"".The only regret regarding this book is that there was not enough of Alex's love, Robin or Det. Milo Sturgis.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it."
1,Let's be honest: not a very good book...,"Per other reviewers, ""Monster"" just lacks that overall drive. It's really slow, the surprises really aren't all that surprising (I just knew one key character was clearly in on it) and to be honest, I want to tell you right now whodunit! Honestly, don't waste your time on this especially when there are so many other better reads (particularly anything by Ellroy)."
3,The usual serial killer whodunit.,"Kellerman breaks no new ground in his new thriller ""Monster"". The books starts interestingly enough with our heroes Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware trying to solve a series of grisly murders. They have a hard time figuring out how the murders are connected and whether or not a pathetic mental patient who has been locked up for many years has some connection to the killings. Milo and Alex are likeable enough, but the book has some big weaknesses. It is too long. The descriptions of the mental hospital/prison (Starkweather) are lengthy and tedious. Every scene is described in exhaustive detail. The middle of the book is slow-moving and the ending is convoluted and not particularly suspenseful. If Kellerman's writing had been tighter, the book would have packed a greater wallop. As it is, my interest waned at least 100 pages before the long-awaited end."
4,Intricate,"this was a great book with many twist and turns. i thought it was a very original plot that kept you guessing who the villian was till the last page of the book.however, i must warn you to pay careful attention to everything you have read. as the book draws to its conclusion, the author starting throwing many curveballs at the reader. at times, the plot gets very muddled; but still very original"
4,Page turner -- but predictable,"This is my first Kellerman. The book jacket hooked me at the store. I found the book exciting and fast-paced -- after a slow start. I loved the plot twists and the Chinatown-like subplot involving the little town of Treadway. I found the descriptions at the mental hospital evocative and interesting. Only one problem: I figured out the ending fairly early on, and was surprised that Delaware and Milo didn't, too. And I am one of those who virtually never figures out the ending. But even so, I found myself anxiously reading every page, and stealing extra time to do so."
3,"As an airplane book, it does the trick","Kellerman doesn't neglect the elements that made his book such a success, but neither does he manage to weave those elements together into something more than reasonably entertaining.In _Monster_, Dr. Delaware helps Milo Sturgis put together a series of obviously connected but seemingly random murders to catch a dangerous killer. They begin in a hospital for the criminally insane and have to navigate a long series of red herrings to finally come to a solution.The parts in the hospital are really fascinating, and carry that Delaware flavor I like best-- the part where I feel like he has a real job whose knowledge he's able to leverage. The rest of the plot, however, is incredibly convoluted and relies on some rather overdone tricks to bring the book to a close."
2,Less than expected,This was my first Jonathan Kellerman book. I must say I wasn't overly impressed. I figured out the ending of the book a quarter of the way through it. It seemed to me that he raised questions to try to divert the reader away from the obvious. He should have spent more time on the interesting characters. Instead of all the other page fillers.
4,Not Bad,"I enjoy the team of Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware. Milo is an a police officer and Alex a pychologist. The ""monster"" is Ardis Peake who is in Starkweather which is for the criminally insane after being convicted of killing his mother and the family that she works for. There are many strange murders taking place in the area and the ramblings of Peake make it sound like he knows all about them. Peake is heavily sedated and has had no visitors. It is a great plot but the story could definitely been condensed. Definitely worth reading but not the best in the Sturgis/Delaware series."
2,PASS ON THIS ONE,"An avid Kellerman fan, I was extremely disappointed in this book. Boring and disjointed. Kellerman plants some interesting ideas and fails to follow through on them. I believe an unknown author would never have had this book published--just didn't hang together!"
2,The Kellermans need a sabbatical!,"The plot was comparable to Kellerman's other plots - interesting and attention grabbing. However, many of the touches that breathe life into Alex, Robin, Spike and Milo were gone. From page one, Alex was on the case, full time. How'd that happen? Usually Milo has to coax him in. And the police department was terribly tolerant of Alex from Jump Street. Also missed anything about Milo's life, and Robin, who's usually a little freaked out by Alex's activities was the perfect little hausfrau cooking meals and orering pizza. Even Spike was one dimensional. Kellerman got too wrapped up in the plot, ignoring the very qualities that make his books so readable. After reading his wife's Moon Music, can only conclude they're working WAY too hard and need some time away from the old word processors. The plot of this book may have benefitted from protagonists other than Alex and Milo. New heroes, maybe?"
3,Some Parts Just Don't Connect,"The basic story here is fairly interesting. You wonder through the first half of the book who is behind all these terrible murders. Then there seems to be several possibilities behind the grisly terrors but the one main suspect still stands out two thirds of the way through. However many of the connections from scene to scene are not introduced too well. It is never really clear if Heidi Ott had any evil intentions or not. Frank Dollard seems to be evil as well but why was he killed off? Maybe because he talked too much to the investigators. Kellerman describes Ardis Peak, Milo, Dr. Delaware, and Derrick Crimmins fairly well but many of the other people he fails to add anything very gripping, Therefore, when you are introduced to a new suspect, it is really a fifty fifty shot if they are part of the rampant murders. The ending is fairly interesting but many of the connections could have been established with greater clarity."
3,"Interesting, but not up to Kellerman's usual work.","I am a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman, and have enjoyed all of his books to date. I enjoyed Monster, but did not think that it was up to the standard of his other books. The story seemed to take unpredictible twists and turns, and the crime seemed to be resolved purely through psychological guesses by Alex Delaware, rather than through a combination of his insight and Milo's police work. In addition, there was little in the way of relationship development between Delaware and Robin. Worst of all, while the ending was climactic, I found that it reminded me too much of one of Faye Kellerman's earliest books, the Sacred and Profane. Despite these drawbacks, I did find the book an interesting read."
3,A to B,"This book is a page turner and I like JK's style because he tells the story from point A to B without the irritating multiple stories going on at the same time that others like Michael Criton use. The characters are developed more than most, including his wife Faye, who can't describe Rita without using the words seder or minyon in the first paragraph. Sure it's not the greatests, but it is a definitive book by a good author."
2,Typical Kellerman,"I gave Kellerman one more chance. I read a review in the Detroit Free Press. This reviewer thought it was excellent and once again I should have stuck with the real readers who thought it was ok. The story dragged on and on, typical of Kellerman, and my advice is: GET IT IN PAPERBACK!"
3,Not Widescreen...but still fun.,"It's true, this DVD isn't in widescreen as advertised on the box. But in all honesty, I hardly think it matters with a movie like this. Ski School is a classic T&A cheesefest in the truest sense. Minimal plot, great skiing scenes, lame jokes and occasionally whitty dialogue and lots of naked ladies. Dean Cameron is a funny guy though, and this film has a certain charm that makes it irresistable. I do actually prefer the sequal, Ski School 2, over this one because of Toddorbert. But over all it's a pleasant film worthy of your time if you're into this sort of insanity. So...check your brain at the door, have some fun And learn the history of the Lambada!"
1,NEVER GOT IT,Tried to by it ..then said it was not in stock..DAAHHH.why are you trying to sell it if it is not in stock
1,False advertising *NOT WIDESCREEN*,MGM SHOULD BE SUED FOR FALSE ADVERTISING AND AMAZON SHOULD CHANGE THE SPECS AND ALLOW RETURNS THIS FILM
5,The way an 80s sex comedy should be done!!!,"Finally after years of waiting....the DVD is here. I will order it as soon as I can. My 15 year old VHS copy is almost destroyed because I've watched it so many times. Those of you who are JAG fans will recognize Patrick Laboryteaux as Ed. Great performance, but the funniest are given by Dean Cameron and Tom Bresnahan. Dave Marshak assures the evil yuppy skipro Reid Janssen in the first scene, ""You're too late Reid. I've already put into action a devious and elaborate plan to rid this mountain of you and your satanic presence forever."" and it gets better from there. Whose Under Is It? will have you in stitches. The movie was done at Whistler so the scenes are pretty good with the exception of the final one. Madcap party antics and a visit from a Playboy playmate make this movie great."
3,"Incomplete, could have been better","Very good first half, but falls short discussing past 100 years. No mention of Latin America, very European in point of view. No indept discussion on the great recession."
1,Let down,"I've been a Robert Stone fan since way back, but I never finished Damascus Gate and Bay of Souls was a big let-down. It was a mish-mash of foriegn intrigue and existential angst and male sexual fantasy. What went wrong? This guy is one of our best. Hopefully, this is just a temporary diversion."
3,Good but not at the level of past work,Bay of Souls is reminiscent of previous Stone novels such as A Flag For Sunrise and Outerbridge Reach. The writing here is effective but the whole thing seems a bit rushed. Themes and characterizations are not fleshed out as much as in his other novels. This book would make for a good introduction to the author's prose style (like the short story collection Bear and His Daughter) but overall it isn't as satisfying as his earlier work.
2,"Strickland, where are you?","Stone's novels have always had holier-than-thou,pondrous protagnoists. But, they've always been brilliantly balanced by intense yet hilarious, real characters. Pablo lets 'A Flag for Sunrise' work (see, i can't even recall the main character's name.) Walker and the hilarious directors allow the seriousness of LuAnne in 'Children of Light'. And of course, the great Strickland, one of the most enjoyable characters in modern fiction, gets us through the flat and humorless Brown in 'Outerbridge Reach.'But in ""damascus Gate' and now 'Bay of Souls', everyone is pondering their existence, no one is fun, let alone funny or light, nothing balances the Drama. And that's what these books are getting to be: paperback Dramas, not the multilayered, back and forth novels Bob has written with such perfection."
3,"sluggish start, strong middle, but in the end... save your $","Before I picked this CD up I read the other reviews. Many of them suggested that it was a really bad show, I didn't believe them, I figured that it was just people who were snobs. I was wrong. The first couple songs are dreadful, about the middle it picks up and there are a few songs that I do actually like. But really this is not Broadway's elite and if you are looking for a broad overview of Sondheim's work, I wouldn't start here. Better options would be ""Sondheim: A Celebration AT CARNEGIE HALL"" or ""The Stephen Sondheim Album"". Don't waste your $$$ on this."
5,This is a very good book if you like chocolate.,Chairle is very poor and something very cool happens to him. He finds the last golden ticket and gets to go to the chocolate factory. He had a nice time at the chocolate factory. In the end he became the owner of the chocolate factory. I think it would be neat to own the chocolate factory.
3,"Not bad, but...","I love the space saving capability of this design, and the ease of access with the tins (just turn for shake or pour capability). HOWEVER - the tins are not air-tight, and the plastic cover on the tins is reactive to some spices. My cumin became encased in a plastiky mess, and the salt becomes a salt block within days. Also, due that the spices are stored on their sides, there's constantly a mess of spice-jumble on the counter under the spice tins. I still use the tins for spices that I use up really quickly - oregano, marjoram, etc.... - but have to keep a separate stock of anything that reacts with moisture and the plastic tops (trial and error). I would look into other storage options if you're not tight on space."
4,Happy,"Well packed and arrived a little late, I'm in Australia however. Looks like good quality, except the screws had to use my own as these broke. Overall however I'm really happy with it and have sent this product to a couple of friends that might want one too."
1,i cant find song titles,i cant find song titles for this CD and was pondering upon purchasing the product on line
5,Excellent for clerkships and the shelf,Great book! Really covered the minute details one needs to have a handle of at the hand of the IM clerkship. Very useful for boards and easy to read format. Only drawback is that sometimes the title of the case doesn't really explain all the info that will be packed into the case. I definitely recommend reading it early in the rotation and reading it well!
1,Poor Replica of Great Country Songs,I love country music but this CD pack leads you to believe these are original song artists - very disappointing - it is like listening to kroaoke some unknowns singing your favorite songs.
5,Only to listen with someone that understands you!,"The very first time I heard this CD I started crying...It is a CD full of introspection; it made me feel sadness and hope at the same time, because what we hear is not simple music but true human fellings...I consider myself a lucky person because I always heard this cd with someone that I understood and liked...Because this a unique cd, and sometimes one person listening to it is already too much."
5,Overwhelming!,"The most wonderful solo piano album I've ever heard!This CD is romantic and quiet. It really triggers our romantic side. Special congratulations on ""Someone to watch over me"" that sends shivers down my spine."
2,audio quality is poor,"I don't like this CD because the Piano is recorded in a very bad way (sorry for my poor english): no high frequencies, no low frequencies... BAD.And the sweetnes of this music is so distant from energy you can feel on ""La Scala"" or ""Koln Concert"" or ""Spheres"" or many other marvellous Jarrett's CD."
1,A travesty to this great player that the piano itself is horrid,"If you really want to see how great Jarrett is...just go to YouTube and see his LIVE rendition of Porgy...it's one of the greatest performances I have seen or heard in my life. Its why I ran to buy this cd. What a shocking disappointment. The piano he used on the album is shockingly poor. It will hurt your ears...and no...there is nothing wrong with my particular cd player. I have high end tube equipment and professional speakers...and in fact own a wonderful Steinway myself...so I know quality...and I know the shame that such glorious music and composition should have been done on a piano this poor. I'm sorry Keith..but youare listed as the engineer on the album and Cavelight Studios appears to be YOUR outfit. Your wife, you, and the public,...deserved to have your greatness memorialized better than this rabid disappointment."
4,Amazing harmony,"The combination of voices on this recording is really mesmerizing, and the minimal instrumental accompaniment is a nice change from a lot of music from the Folk Revival that was either a little overproduced or patronizing in its attempts at faux-Appalachian.I'll set aside my annoyance that they were from New York city and not actually Appalachian, since they do an above-average imitation. In case you didn't know, the recording on here of ""I'll Fly Away"" is the one that was used in _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_, and was unfortunately omitted from the soundtrack album. It's a good recording of it, although it and a few of the other tracks are a little dispirited for my taste (only as a matter of personal preference, though; they'd not bad recordings)."
1,"If you want protection, then don't buy this case","Quite simply the case is so hard, I noticed a small scratch on my ipod screen after it had been in this so called protective case. Do yourself a favour and buy an iskin exo. a cover made of silicone that fits like a skin to your ipod and allows you to access the buttons, hold switch and attach your firewire and headphones without haveing to remove the Ipod from it."
4,Expected more from this brand; tough to clean,"The effect on my pictures is negligible -- hardly a difference, if any. Bought it to protect the lens, though -- and it does do that. I've found it impossible to COMPLETELY clean up this baby -- which was, relatively speaking, very dirty when I got it. In fact, I thought it was all scratched up, but most of the stuff came off -- with a lot of effort and time. At the same time, I bought a dollar-something generic filter to have as a back up -- it fully cleaned up in no time. Seems crisper to the naked eye. But, spooked by the price, I'm leaving that as the back up. Though it does look better. It's a Japan made UV filter. This one is a US made sky1 -- for what it's worth."
3,It flares,"Started shooting right after received the lens tonight. Tried to shoot at the light bulb and could see the flaring. Took off the glass, shooting the same object, flare was gone. Tried different light bulbs and results were same. Too bad. So I guess it maybe same results with day time into the sun?I were paring with Canon 50mm f/1.8mm. Not sure if I want to keep it. For protection, it's the one but the flare really bothers me."
1,What the heck is this?,"This is really a horrible book. I can't believe that any serious publisher agreed to print this. The author's thesis is that our productivity and national wealth has been stagnating since 1973 - about as original a thesis as smoking is bad for your health. But then the author does nothing to explain why this happened or how we could reverse it. All he does is repeat the same formula information over and over again. It reads like the work of a fifth grader. More importantly, though, is that since the release of Mr. Madrick's book both our productivity and national wealth has soared, rendering his point largely mute. Stay away from this book."
5,A rare gem of a film!,"This is a great mystery made in England in 1945. It's an engrossing mystery that tells of the troubles an elderly couple inherit when they buy a house in the English countryside (circa 1900) following their retirement. When a paid companion comes to stay with them, the spirit of a young woman who died in the house 40 years earlier begins to wreak havoc on the house and its inhabitants. The acting is superb! James Mason is nearly unrecognizable in his makeup, but his performance is wonderful! It's truly a suspenseful, well-done film that's worth getting. They don't make many mysteries better than this."
2,Deja vu,"After enjoying my first exposure to Wayne Johnston with his latest, The Custodian of Paradise, I rushed to the local library to delve into some of his prior works. This one was a mistake. I'm experiencing a regrettable deja vu in The Navigator of New York, with the plot device of a teenager discovering, via surreptitiously conveyed and lengthy letters, that his parentage is not what he thought. What is Johnston's fixation with women marrying men they do not love because they're carrying another man's child, and then the child discovering years later, from the sperm donor, in the most convoluted and protracted manner imaginable, that he/she is being observed or protected by his/her actual father? This one cannot sustain my interest - been there, done that."
3,vastly overrated,"I am determined to get through it. but it is not an enjoyable read. I bought it on enthusiastic revues from many critics so will definitely get it read sometime. There is a method of getting to sleep that I use quite often. Read a boring book, not an interesting one. This book cetainly fills the bill. I'm quite sure this will not be included in your list of customer reviews, but I had to tell you. How is it all your book reviews end up with 4 or 5 stars?? Can;'t blame me for being a a little cynical!"
1,Upside down history with a vengeance,"The anti-Peary and anti-Henson vendetta will spare no expense of time, money or effort to advance their agenda. I'd compare this effort to a novel in which Hitler is the hero and Patton is shown to be a frightened little wimp, so worthless that we end up cheering on Adolph. If seeing history's heros, who made tremendous physical sacrifices, demeaned as if buffoons is your cup of tea then this is your kind of reading. Bravo to Random House for putting this one in print, eh?"
2,"Great topic, executed horribly.","Fred Reed's idea was to write a travel narrative of his quest to learn about Said Nursi, an Islamic dissident who still has an active following 50 years after his death. Said Nursi is a fascinating man deserving a fascinating study: Reed's scholarship is fine, but his book fails miserably.I could barely get through his writing, despite my determination to finish the book. Full of ironic pretensions to omniscience, with the self-pity and self-doubt that characterizes impotent intellectuals, Reed's writing could put out small fires. He is paranoid and suspicious, and his writing full of quickly withdrawn implications. Preoccupied with displaying his cleverness, he fails to take anything seriously.If you want to learn about Said Nursi and his followers, I don't know of a better source, and that is a sad statement. Yet there is absolutely no other reason to endure this book."
1,Box set ??,"As we are to focus on the album's content..........Well, you may have no photo but a track listng (content) sure would be helpful from Amazon. Why waste time and space without these anyway. I would not think of purchasing without some REAL info........"
5,Great pictures everytime.,This camera takes great pictures all the time. I haven't had one picture that has turned out bad. It is also very easy to use and there are lots of fun things you can do with it. I would recommend this camera to anyone.
4,Perfect.....With One Small Flaw,"This is THEE perfect Book of Shadows. The book is hardcover, extremely black with a silver/white pentagram on the front and tons of blank pages for you to write in. The image shown here on Amazon.com is exactly what you will receive when you purchase this little gem.The ONLY drawback to this is that - as others before me have stated - it says ""Book of Shadows"" on the spine of the book. I knew this going into it and even having purchased and received it, it doesn't bother me much. Obviously, you could always paint over the ""Book of Shadows"" label on the spine or cover it up in some other way. I suppose my only ""beef"" with it saying ""Book of Shadows"" on the spine is that it doesn't really allow you to keep it as secret as it should be, you know?The paper in the book is high quality with lots of space to write. I highly recommend this product for a solitary Witch or a small coven."
4,Monsoon Wedding,This movie is long...but if you stick with it...you will find it enjoyable. It features a great cast...and gives you a good idea as to what the Indian culture is all about....especially how Indians prepare and celebrate weddings.
5,'Nair's best' by a writer.,"Monsoon Wedding is a film for people who like Cassevetes or Altman. The spectator needs to be sharp and an experienced film-goer. Here we have a middle class Indian family (one of 50 odd million in India alone) getting ready for a wedding, the most important event in their lives.It starts like a ballet, with many characters going in and out. you will get to know them. have patience, settle down, this is India today, with problems such as we all have : family members who do not get on, generation gaps, skeletons in the cupboard, sex, laziness, inefficiency and charm humour, music, colour, real people (but no Hindi-style dance sequences) this is a really great film, extremely well directed and acted. Should have gone to the Oscars. Go see it.Jim HodgettsChennai"
1,Simply the emptiest imaginable project,"I wouldn't even call this a film. It looks like one long MTV video, or a hip, happening tourism commercial. Depressingly shallow, the movie never tries to convey anything at all. I felt like someone told me interminable, tedious, mild stories about their family, while the TV played in the background, and someone arranged flowers nicely in the foreground. The 'making-of' documentary on the DVD showcased the glibness of the director, so impressed by cellphones and computers side-by-side with pigs and saris, that she completely lost sight of the fact that texture does not make a tale."
1,4 stars away from perfection.,"A completly inaccurate portrayal of Indian culture. With absolutely no ties to originality and uniqueness of productivity.This is a westernized movie that can only be appealing to a western perspective,thus showing the depth of western influence towards raping unique nations of their sense of unique and different culture. Not much realism or realistic ideas.Very poor work by very poor minded people."
1,Yuck,"...If you are one of the ABCDs who love to denigrate Indian culture and family values, then this is the film for you. Otherwise if you like good clean movies without an abundance of swearwords or profanity, then give this movie a skip."
1,Received bootleg version of DVD,Have not watched this DVD because it is obviously a recorded version. Not an original DVD.
5,My favourite movie,"I have watched this movie at least 5 times already and each time it moves me to tears. Some people compare it to My Big Fat Greek Wedding--which I did not like--but I really can't see any comparison. MBFGW was supposed to be a lighthearted comedy, where MW has humour and lots of drama, as well as a deeper look into the culture and deeper character of the protagonists. The music is beautiful and appropriate, the acting is fantastic (featuring many non-actors), and the plot is riveting."
1,"Inane, tasteless and waste of time",I watched this movie after reading the positive reviews. But this movie is a piece of trash. The portrayal of a typical wedding in India is far removed from reality. There is no depth to the story and characters are very artificial. Do not waste your money on this movie.
3,Pretty Good,"Enjoyed the Culture,Music,Vibe&Overall element my only knock with the film is that it explored to many things&somewhere in the middle it got dragged a bit.but the Wedding,clothes&the Ladies were Great&the Music was off the Hook.the film was Pretty Good&worth checking out."
5,Cherry Home Companion,"I can't imagine a world without cherries or this great book about how to bring them to your table with style. All of the recipes in the Cherry Home Companion are uncomplicated and yield magnificent results. One of the recipes is an absolute necessity for a memorable brunch: (Chef) Rich Travis' Cherry Mascarpone French Toast hot from the oven with dollops of whipped cream brings raves every time. You'll think you died and went to heaven. (You may even need a private moment, if you know what I mean!) - If you haven't already guessed, I highly recommend this book!"
3,Hardcore HK/CYF fans only!,"If you love Honk Kong Cinema or Chow Yun Fat, you'll probably like this movie, although I thought it was the worst CYF flick I've seen. Don't buy this movie if you are just getting into HK action, you'd be better off with 'A Better Tomorrow' or 'The Killer'. This movie is basically a low budget action film with bad acting (except CYF) and a pretty corny plot."
1,Very general with little practical advice,This book is very dissapointing. It may be good for someone who wants a book about the general idea of sculpture but it gives very little practicle information
2,Awesome idea gone bad,"This was probably the most anticipated book, for me. I couldn't wait to read it. Well, I liked the book much more in my imagination, what I thought it would be about. The hype surrounding this book is for nought! As an African American Gone With the Wind lover, I was truly excited about reading the story from the other perspective. How disappointing! I'm not sure why the Margaret Mitchell Estate had such a problem with this book, seeing that it doesn't even resemble the story at all. It is badly written, doesn't stay true to the events in the original, and never fleshes out any of the characters! Don't waste your time or money."
1,I hope all the Wind Done Gone out of Alice Randall,"The Wind Done Gone is the most unorganized, unimaginative and completely [...] work I have ever attempted to read. Randall insults Mitchell's God given talent as a writer. I must forwarn all readers that you are better off reading the National Enquirer it will contain far less soap opera trash than Alice Randall's book. The book unfolds slowly and the characters are one dimentional. I strongly believe Alice Randall's does nothing for the African American cause except make herself look uneducated and single minded. Please don't buy this book."
2,Much ado about nothing,"For all the hoop-la surrounding this novella, I really did not get excited about it. It was rather disappointing. The author was a little inconsistent in time events. It was difficult to follow and the dialect fluctuated too much. Not at all what I expected."
2,sad sad,I was really hype about this book. but it really failed to even hold my attention for more than 5 chapters. maybe i'm missing something. but i don't think you should waste you're time. unless you are completly bored.
1,Pulleeze !,"I just finished this book after putting it down several times to read... something else.In a time when it's probably harder than ever for (good) writers to be published, I think Ms. Randall chose to ""butcher a classic"" in order to make her way to bookshelves.And sadly, what actually made it to the shelves was a ""gimmicky"" piece of junk! Save your money folks...and use your library cards for something else other than this."
2,"I read it, but I didn't enjoy it","And it had nothing to do with being a diehard fan of Margaret Mitchell. In fact, I've never read Gone with the Wind and barely sat through the movie.Maybe that's why I didn't like it. I didn't always understand the character references or recognize events referenced. Still, that was not why I didn't like it.I didn't like it because it hopped back and forth to different historical points without giving me a sense of why. Perhaps the author was *too* successful in portraiting the jumble of Cynara's thoughts. Had her story been told in a narrative format, perhaps my reaction would be different."
2,The Wind Done Gone,Supplier filled as promised. The book was not one I would recommend. Maybe too much to live up to with the book it trailed
1,Political Corrections,"Although touted as 'the unauthorised parody' of Gone With the Wind, it lacks both the wit and humor necessary to carry it off. The story is plodding and pedestrian, told in the first person as if written in a diary. Cindy is a mulatto woman, child of Gerald O'Hara and Mammy, half-sister to Scarlett and long time lover of Rhett Butler. She's been to Europe, outlived most of the O'Hara family and is meant to be a 'strong resourceful black woman'of her time, a role model. However it is as a cardboard cutout of such a role model that she works best, being two dimensional and altogether lacking in life! Rather than exploding the myth of GWTW, this novel serves better as an example of editorial fallibility. The author meant well I'm sure, unfortunately contemporary politics and pseudo-afrocentric feminist analysis do not a great historical parody make."
1,Despicable!!!! A true classic is sullied!!!,"This book should never have been allowed to be published. The characters and story of ""Gone With The Wind"" are not only etched in the hearts of millions of fans, but are copyrighted in law. To take those characters and use it in this manner is despicable and illegal. GWTW is one of the finest novels ever to be written and one of the best movies in motion picture history. ""The Wind Done Gone"" takes wonderful, classic characters and mocks & belittles them. GWTW was an incredible story of the Old South, a time and place that has been forever lost to the forces of political correctness ""The Wind Done Gone"" is nothing more than politically correct propaganda."
3,The Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall,"This novel was basically a interwine of Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone with the Wind"" which I also love. But this novel ""The Wind Done Gone"" can use extra more explanation of some of the characters. The book is taken of out context and is not clear enough to follow at first but then it does later in chapters."
2,If only the wind blew this book away,"This novel is sort of told in Diary form. Cynara, Cindy, or Cinnamon, whatever she calls herself in each chapter is the daughter of Planter and Mammy, making her Scarlett's half sister. She tells us she is more beautiful than her sister and that she is living with her husband R. She will also have us believe that Mrs. O'Hara was engaged to her first cousin and was also a negro. Oh, and Ashley was gay and having an affair with Prissy's brother. Oh, Please!Other than the far fetched story, the writing was disjointed and hard to follow. The author bounced all over the place, so much so, that you hardly know when or where you are. I was looking forward to a much better story, and the makings are there, but it went with the wind."
1,The Final Question,"What a total disappointment! After finally getting around to reading""The Wind Done Gonethe final question on my mind was not ""I wonder what happened to..?""orWhere The Mulatto children of Tara were, It was ""Why did I bother to read this Book?!""Ms Randall manages to take the beloved characters of Margaret Mitchell, and turnthem into a group of shallow, often bloodthirsty People.(Mammy And Prissy bothcommit murder.)You find yourself constantly asking ""whats the point?My advice toanyone who enjoys a good read.... Dont buy this book!"
1,Hysterical Hypocrisy,"Well, fiddle de de and la de da. Here we go with yet another example of reverse discrimination thinly veiled as literature. What a waste of paper, ink, and the readers' time and money. Ms. Randall has a WAY overinflated view of herself and of the value of her work."
2,Average and Under,"The book has a few genuinely amusing scenes, but overall it falls short of parody: it's neither biting nor insightful. The premise is awe-inspiring, but the execution could have been so much better in abler hands.This is another example of Hype over Substance, which is unfortunate.... the book might have been a better read if it had been given a slow word-of-mouth buildup. As it stands, you can't separate the book from the publicity, which makes the author's average writing ability seem worse than merely average."
3,A Long Time Coming,"Bravo! I say to Alice Randall for attacking the book that enabled white girls everywhere to relive the ""glories"" of the Confederacy. That said, ""The Wind Done Gone"" is still a meditation on Margaret Mitchell's characters-with a few new ones thrown in-and it never for me takes on a life of its own. Cynara, the narrator, sounds suspiciously contemporary and slips in and out of character. Still,Randall is steeped in the culture of slavery, and she reveals its dirty linen stain by stain. Now that she's dispensed with Other (Scarlett) and Mealymouth (Melaney), maybe she'll put what she knows into a work of her own."
1,Some Therapy Might Help More,"I have read all of the Gone with The Wind books, seen all the movies and love the whole story. I have also read everything else I can get my hands on, including Uncle Toms Cabin, Roots, Mandingo etc. I found this book preposterous in its story line and difficult to follow. I think that perhaps the author may want to seek some therapy rather than proposing ridiculous plots like this one. There is just something inherently wrong with these writings."
1,Disappointing,"I was hoping for MORE. I know it would be hard to follow a novel as great as Gone With The Wind, but even the dialect that was soooo good in Gone With The Wind is missing in this book.I hated that Randall tarnished the reputation of Mamie. I loved that character in Gone With The Wind, and now I am so disappointed.I love books and I am glad that I own this one, but I was not impressed."
2,The Ideal Left with the Wind,"""Waste makes me angry!"" Declares Rhett Butler in the movie production of Gone with the Wind. ""And that's all this is, a terrible waste."" I had similar feelings after reading The Wind Done Gone. When I first heard about it, I was instantly intrigued by the concept, but it didn't take long for my hopes to be dashed. This book had the opportunity to be the defining criticism against the 1930's idealistic memories of the antebellum era, and instead the historically void, angst-ridden and sex filled plot leaves you feeling empty.It truly is the anti-Gone with the Wind book, but if you take that dubious honor away, the book has no merits of it's own left to stand on.The reason I gave it two stars: One, the overall cleverness of the idea, however badly it was executed, and two, for the fun I had figuring out the GWTW characters from their ""nicknames""."
4,The Truth About Slavery,"Alice Randall's ""The Wind Done Gone"" gives a vivid picture of the pre and post war South. Randall depicts life on the Gone With the Wind Plantation-through the eyes of the family's slaves. The main character who is the master's love child, is unremarkably intelligent and displays her inherent childishness, even into her adulthood. Randall portrays most of the relationships between whites and blacks as consensual, ignoring the history of slave rape-but nevertheless creates a believable plot. I thoroughly enjoyed her method of story telling, that often required you to pay close attention to the text. (Hence why someone stated in their review that they didn't understand the ending, and revealed some of the plot) Overall I think she did a wonderful job while using a lot less paper than the orignial novel."
2,Fan-fiction?,"Most of what I think about this book has been said, and said well. The writing is mediocre at best, and it's NOT a parody.It strikes me as a sorry attempt at fan-fiction, and Cindy/Cinnamon/Cynara makes for a fine example of a 'Mary Sue'.Had the author intended to write the story from the view of the slaves at Tara, well, there were plenty of established characters to pick from. Why not write the story from Mammy's view, for example? Now that might have been interesting to read. But no, she had to invent a character... the super-beautiful, intelligent, mistreated but feisty half-sister. Good grief."
4,The controversy is understandable,"This book is well worth reading and is head and shoulders above GWTW. The story is told without getting the reader bogged down in words and is thought provoking. I will never plow through GWTW again, but I may find myself enjoying the movie, now that there is a different back story to appreciate. The sterotypes in the movie were always offensive, but I would enjoy the burning of Atlanta.Cynara's story is much more sympathetic than Scarlet's but her take on things, makes Scarlet a lot easier to take. The Margaret Mitchell heirs may have felt this book would detract from the original but they were wrong."
2,Uninspired,I approached this book with great anticipation after reading a glowing review. I found I had a hard time sustaining interest in the book. I did not find the characters to be well drawn. Ms. O'Brien seemed to be so in love with her prose that I had difficulty understanding the motivation for her characters behavior. This seemed more an exercise in the writing of prose than in the crafting of a novel.
1,"DON""T MESS WITH THIS!","It sounds terrible. I've been working with pipes for over 7 years and the rose wood chanters are NOT worth it. Go for something more weighty and sturdy. They are not tuned correctly and if you ever get serious, you will need to buy a new chanter anyways. I am also not a fan of the feel of the holes on this one...too small to give a proper feel."
1,don't mess with the classics,"This CD is very disappointing. None of the recordings are the original versions. Instead they do new versions of their hits replacing Lionel's parts with J.D. Nicholas and Walter Orange. The results are predictable. The songs sound like very bad remakes. No offense to J.D. and Walter, but there was a reason while Lionel sang lead on those songs. Stay away from this CD if you want the original versions with Lionel Richie."
2,waste of money,"This is a waste of money for what you get. Go buy a piece of felt and make it yourself! It is just a piece of felt, no sewing, no backing, nothing."
2,Not good,We did not like Jerry in this. The show was not funny.The package came in good condition. The show waa not worth the money.
4,I absolutely loved this DVD,"I never started watching his TV show until the last season, silly me. His comedy is brilliant. I find myself viewing this performance every 4-6 months and it always delivers."
5,Jerry Seinfeld - in genious,"To sum the carrier of Jerry Seinfeld in a few simple words; ""I'm telling you for the last time"" doesn't only mark the end of this great artist's line up of shows, series and whatnots. It sets _the_ mark of stand-up comedy, and easily ends up as - well, why not - the greatest stand-up comedy shows in time. Jerry Seinfeld and his infamous comedy style has forever changed the genre and this very show, aired on HBO as live on Broadway, really shows why we all love Seinfeld's comedy style.If cheap laughs, undesired ""it's funny 'cuz it's true""-remarks and everyday comedy ever was the symptoms, ""I'm Telling You For The Last Time"" turns out as the cure. Even without sideeffects."
5,Typical Seinfeld,Absolutely amazing. I was very happy to receive this DVD for just $1.01. I feel bad that it didn't cost me more so I personally sent Jerry Seinfeld $20 in order to feel better. He said this was a very nice thing and came to my birthday party. Thank you Amazon!
3,Filling the Void,"I had purchased this book because of the fact I am a huge fan of Elliott. After I finished reading it I did feel a lot closer to understanding Smith as an artist and a person. Although at some points I felt there was too much unnecessary information that distracted the reader. I also felt as if it jumped back and forth too much between periods of Smith's life. Given the restricted resources Nugent had to work with, this book does the job of shedding light into the mysterious world surrounding Smith. The Big Nothing fills the void of literature on Smith and should be appreciated for what it is, the only book written on Smith to date."
2,Not Natural or Very Calming,"This album is forced, and feels like someone tried very hard to produce a Japanese product without knowing what the Reiki practitioner needs during a treatment. That is, a relaxing CD with low tones, calming effects, and natural sounds [most of the sounds are via a sound sampling sythesizer and have a clipped quality]. All this is not what this album delivers and I cannot recommend this for a practitioner, but it may be OK for ambient music otherwise."
1,"How did they do that, THAT IS A QUESTION ?","The book starts well, but very soon the case studies get very brief and almost vague. You will learn more by reading articles from Design in Motion homepage.Or,if you really want to know how they did it, I recommend ""After Effects in Production"", where Trish&Chris Meyer included many case studies form major studios. Don't waste your money on this book, because you won't learn much."
5,Outstanding vocalist with consumnate phrasing.,"I am so pleased to have found Caterina's work on Amazon. My vintage collection from the 50's was destroyed by fire in the 70's. I have missed her music so much since and now it is available again. Thanks Amazon. Now will you try to get the company to digitally remaster and release her ""Classics with a Chaser"" with the Werner Mueller Orchestra, please. Or I'd appreciate an email from anyone who may know where I could get a copy. Thanks again."
2,What is this? Half rap half crap,"I dont know what to say about this, when you listen to Jay-Z's album, then 50 cents its like wow, this dude is horrible now, the rapping is basic, and recycled, half the time he tryin to sound too hard and u cant understand what he saying. Eminem smoked 50 on that track so bad it was almost shocking... the only good track was Baby By Me, and that Em track. even then his rapping skills dont show. He lost it bad."
3,"""Curtis"" was much better","I bought this CD with high expectations - figuring it was going to be better (or at least equal) to the excellent album ""Curtis"". So far, I'm disappointed. There are too many ""lovey-dovey"" songs with female singers in them, which are about relationships and sexual themes. I don't like those types of songs on rap records. So far my only favorite song on the record is ""Crime Wave"", with a nice beat and an otherwise decent song. Maybe as I listen to it more I'll warm up to it more but so far I'm not terribly impressed.If you're expecting something as good or better than Curtis was, you'll be disappointed."
2,album review,"50 cent is one of the biggest names in the rap industry over the past 6 or seven years, producing hardcore hits that have been listened to over and over again. His newest cd doesnt do it for me though, because he doesnt have that swag that he used to have when he released ""get rich or die trying"" or ""the massacre."" The beats arent as good and there aren't any great songs that don't get old. 50 cent is established enough to be forgiven for a bust album and his next album will most likely be solid. If you like 50, check out FACE, an up and coming artist from brooklyn who just released his first demo. Check this talented rapper out at:[...]"
4,Pretty Good worth the money,"This album overall gets a rating of 3.6/5 not the best album out there but with 50 Cents clever raps and always changing flow and just cuz 50 is a G, Its worth 9.99 for sure,it comes with the CD and a DVD, So you get what you pay for,So dont buy this album thinking its a album like Get Rich or Die Tryin it doesnt go that hard and have that many hits, But overall like i said its a pretty good album, But 50 could make better, For some reason he tried singing a little to much on this album instead of striaght up rapping. But if you like 50 or your just a big fan then buy it. And if you like Gangsta Rap or just rappers that rap with Gangsta Lyrics buy it.."
3,Bring 50 cent back,"I loved the cd not the dvd. The movie was terrible. Bad sound, bad acting, bad lighting, and bad script. Everything else he's done as 50 cent I loved, but this movie as Curtis Jackson was not good. 50 cent should fire his advisers, because someone should have told you that this movie was not good before distribution."
4,They work exactly as needed ...,"I recently added a 10"" Popcorn snare to my kit and needed a stand with a ten-inch snare basket. While searching for the best deal on that piece of hardware. I discovered these little adapter thinga-ma-jigs. They are very reasonably priced and only a fraction of the cost of a new stand; so I thought I'd give them a try. They work exactly as needed to hold the smaller drum and travel from gig to gig with no issues at all."
4,Classic album from the seventies finally makes it to CD,"One of the mist underrated albums from the 70's,Valerie Carter's "" Just a Stone's Throw Away "" is a welcome addition to any CD collection that also might include Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, or Carly Simon. Carter's voice is smooth as silk and her interpretive skills are to be admired, as are her skills at picking material and her own songwriting. From the opening cut, a soaring version of ""Ooh Child,"" to the closing jazz riffs of ""Back to Blue Some More"" Carter explores every possible style of music while still maintaining a cohesive balance throughout. Helping out are such legends as Lowell George, Ronstadt herself, Deniece Williams, and most of Earth, Wind, And Fire,who contribute an amazing amount of funk to ""City Lights."" Do yourself a favor and plop this one on whenever you need to chill, relax, or even have a romantic evening. It is good enough to help you through any mood."
2,Mediocre talent,"Despite support from big-name cameos such as Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt, this falls flat. Clearly well-trained voice is better as back-up vocals than a soloist: nice enough voice (occasionally piercing) but lacks the oomph of a star."
5,THIS BOOK IS REALLY GOOD AND FREAKY DUDE.,I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU GET INTO IT AND STUFF . I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE PART WHERE TANIAS BOYFRIEND WAS FOUND IN THE LOCKER DEAD ITS ALSO FREAKY.YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE SHOULD REALLY READ THIS BOOK AND THEN YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
2,Not so great,"Had these for a little over a year...Some of the covers in my order fit, some were too small. As you probably know, face cradle covers have to fit correctly or the client gets very uncomfortable. The company needs to work on quality control. The fabric was ok but I've seen better flannel, it wore out relatively quickly.Basically you get what you pay for - a cheap product. I'm looking for an alternative source."
3,massage massage pillow covers,"These massage pillow covers are not really quite large enough - they tend to pull and cause the seam to be misaligned, thereby causing the dreaded ""massage face"" on the client. They are especially tight if I have a fleece on the cradle, which I like to do for client comfort. Otherwise, they are nice flannel and reasonably priced."
5,cool movie,"This movie looks cool,it's got hot chicks in it ,zooey deschannel and jena malone.this movie rocks dude ,or dudette what ever u r ,maybe ur a space alien or something .hey dude who looks over the reviews ,whats up?anyway i'm watching it right now on cable ,the only reason i'm writing this review is ,it has no reviews yet and i wanna be the first .awe man it's over ,oh well, watch it, it has a cool bedroom scene with zooey in it .be excellent to each other ,and party on dudes!"
2,Uneven and Uninteresting,"Jerome Hagen's ""War in the Pacific"" is a collection of historical accounts of World War II in the Pacific theater. This is not a unified history of the war: each chapter is a separate subject and based on columns he wrote for the Honolulu Advertiser.The chapters were very uneven -- some focused on a battle, others focused on concepts (like kamikazes). Over half of the book covered events in 1945, when the war was essentially won by 1945. Hagen's writing style was not very interesting, and there were more than a couple readily-spotted factual errors (which made me doubt other facts). Overall, I found this so disappointing and poorly-written that I did not finish the last half of the book.There are countless better books on WWII in the Pacific."
3,satisfactory in imaginative play,I bought this for my daughter who is almost 2. She also has the other pieces in this collection-disney princesses. She plays with all the different pieces together and enjoys the songs and actions. The imaginative play is on the lesser level but overall we are happy with this toy.
1,Terrible audo,"This lecture is full of worthwhile information, unfortunately the audio quality is so terrible, the microphone isn't working correctly, that it is almost impossible to hear what he is saying. On top of this his speech is slurred due to his age. I doubt that Bucky would have found this product to have any integrity. The producers really should have a statement advising people that the quality is terrible. Buy one of his books, but don't waste money on this CD."
4,riso hudson enneogram type indicator version 2.5,I am happy with my purchasethough I am surprised it was only a test and not a book.
5,Swaddleme Microfleece blankey!,"The color is such a cute shade of blue. I love the microfleece material, it's really soft and I can tell Baby will feel nice and snug! Idk why it's the ""Summer Infant.."" blanket, I'm sure this is great for Winter."
5,Best swaddler ever!,"This is the best swaddler ever! It's very easy to use and most importantly, it really does calm my baby down. My baby always looks very comfortable in this swaddler and he sleeps well in it. The microfleece material is warm and soft. I have washed it so many times and it still is just as good as new. Strongly recommend it!"
3,not as shown,The case is pink - not blue as shown. This was a gift for a guy. I'm still gonna use instead of going through the aggravation of a return.
2,Just a Newer Better Remake,Great Job by the Original Animal. Most of us who lived through the sixties will want to add this to their collection. Sure Burdon's voice is deeper and the sound is different. But it is still is a keeper for your Animal collection. Burdon was alway's underrated here in the States...but most of the good ones are.
1,Pretty Sad Stuff,"this album is total garbage . I thought I was getting the real deal . It is , sort of . Just rerecorded songs from the sixties done in a studio . I threw it in the trash . It isnt what I thought at all"
1,WAY TOO MUCH BOOZE!! .....NOT EVEN ANIMALS!,"Its a shame to see what Eric Burdon has done to himself!....seems pissed offabout singing the songs true to the record.... and this band called The Animals ? NOTHING at all or even close to the sound. Who is Eric kidding?If you see Eric Burdon Live...Don't expect to hear ""The Animals"" he is trulyin his own world! with his pick-up band! ""Wont get fooled again"""
4,"Interesting, offbeat, well done",This is not an action movie. It is about how 3 people have their lives changed by meeting each other. It was a good movie.
4,Peter Dinklage Rocks!,"Quiet, character driven flick. The persona of Peter Dinklage's character is thought provoking and intuitive. There are a few unanswered quiestions in this family friendly movie like: running water, electricity, toilet facilities? Overall, we'd watch it again in appreciation of Peter Dinklage."
3,Has its Moments,"This felt like a low-budget Wes Anderson film. Lots of awkward silences and strange character interactions, paired with a plot that's content to just stroll along in no specific direction, picking and choosing new angles like dandelions growing up between the cracks in the sidewalk. At times it's a very good look at what brings people together and what splits them apart, at others a run-of-the-mill ensemble movie with three very different leading parts. It takes a turn for the serious in the final act that kind of sours the mojo it had working earlier on, then coasts to a nondescript anti-ending that just felt like a black screen dropped into the middle of a generic scene."
2,Glorified Bibliography,"Although the title and the first few chapters took me in, I found that the search advice in this book was very limited. The techniques discussed herein are limited to what many high school students learn when using the library. I am not personally familiar with all of the sources mentioned in the book, however, the computer and database related material is quite dated.The number of sources presented and the wealth of specialized publications covered impressed me. Each of these resources was presented with summary information. Due to depth of coverage two stars were awarded.The dearth of practical search strategies makes this book nothing more than a glorified bibliography."
5,improved sound for reasonable shekels,"The Sony MDR-Ex71SL/WK's were a Christmas present. The college student said they were comfortable, and sounded better than the standard headphones. (They come with their own carrying case, a nice plus for a student on the go.)."
4,There are just my size.,"These are perfect headphones if you are like me and have really small ears. I have many sets of different headphones, one which actually sounds a bit better than the Sony MDR-EX71SL but none that fit in my ears so well. I spend time every morning walking my two large dogs and found that all my other headphones pop out while I am walking. The Sonys stay in place (nice that they have 3 different sized buds) and the sound is very good.The price at Amazon.com was half the price in retail stores which for me made it an easy choice. I would recommend these headphones to anyone."
1,The overpriced earphones of the year,"For the money you are much better going with another set. The problem with these headphones is they don't stay in your ear. There is a branch at the top of the headphone where the left unit and the right unit split from the main cord that goes to you're mp3 player. This separation at the top means that the slightest pull on the actual cord will pop your headphone out in one ear constantly. I have to pull the cord over my ear then put it in to keep them in. And if you are working out with these headphones, try another set. The in ear design works perfectly unless you are sweating, then they fall right out. In conclusion, they are a terrible purchase, and the sound quality is equal to much simpler less expensive headphones not carrying the ""sony"" name."
2,The Sony Headphones,"Hi,I actually bought two of these headphones. I had my first pair and one of the ears died, I thought it was a defect went to the store and they happily exchanged it with me.Now, I have the nice shiny white ones. I'm a college student and we have to WALK everywhere we go. These headphones wires get destroyed fairly fast. It's from the oils of your skin. Whoever designed the headphones to put around your neck and then start to tear a break and eventually start to stop working is the con of these headphones.The plus side is that these headphones sound great! Isolate the sound real well, especially at a loud library :)."
3,"Great Sound Quality, Poor Construction","I bought these about a year and a half ago, and the sound quality was amazing. The sound quality is STILL amazing (great bass, nice, full sound!).However, the material the cord is made out of is really attracted to dirt, and it splits really badly. It is slowly falling apart for me. I keep finding myself putting tons of tape around the exposed wires.Really poor quality material."
2,Great sound -- poor durability,"We've had these headphones for 8 months now, and they've had lots of use. They do sound great. Truly great for their size and price. BUT we have also had the insulation turn into a sticky mess leaving bare wires exposed. Absolutely not recommended for this reason. You expect more than a few months wear our of a product like this.I've read that the white ones are more prone to do this than black, so if matching your ipod isn't an issue, black may be the way to go."
1,Sony SUCKS!!!,"SONY SUCKS!!! Dont buy sony products. Their customer service is the worst. These headphones have the weakest wires connecting them. To get it replaced, you have to first send it to a service center then they will charge you more than the cost of the headphones and screw you. Take my advice, don't ever buy a sony product."
5,Awsome!,"these go great with my PSP. Not only do they have great sound quality, but if you use them right you can feel the bass. I was amazed how great they were for the price, I would highly recomend them. However they are fragile, and the case they come with is pretty cheap so be sure you got a place to store them."
4,Great Earbuds,"The best part is the different sized plugs provided. The first ones were too big and would fall out, but after changing them I'm as satisfied with the fit as the sound. I do wish the little case was a bit bigger; you really have to spend some time folding the wires into it."
2,3 of these have failed on me,"These were the first type of earbuds that I use with my iPod. I am a fairly delicate user but there were times that they would fail on me. As I appreciated the sound of these earbuds I would go out and buy the same thing. After the third break on me, I gave up and decided to buy a different earbud."
2,"Great sound, comfortable, but cord deteriated in six months",I love the sound quality. The ear buds fit snuggly yet comfortably in your ear. But after just six months the soft rubbery cord started deteriorating. Now the two little wires inside are exposed in many places and the headphones are shorting out. Definitely not worth the money for the short life span.
3,Sony Can Do Better..,"The Bottom Line:DESIGN - Overall design is weak because when you have both cords connected [one short and long cord], it's simply too long. Also, the way you wear it is annoying because you have to wear it over the shoulders and it stinks. I just one ear piece because it looks weird wearing both.PERFORMANCE - I'd say it's pretty good. When you wear both pieces, the noise cancelling is decent [kind of blocks conversations, if they aren't yelling] and you don't have to listen at a high volume level.FINAL STATEMENT - If I could return this and get something else, I would. After using it for more than a month, it's pretty useful. It goes great with my Zen M. The design just really bugs me."
3,"Good value, OK features","The sound on these headphones is pretty good and they block out a lot of background noise. They stay in my ears when I run. But there are a lot of annoying features:- The case it comes with is plastic-y. And it's difficult to jam all of the cord in it.- The long cable is nice, but can often be too long. They give you a little plastic thingy to twist it on, but that got lost right away. Also, when you take off the extender, the leftover part is a bit short. Only works if you keep the iPod on your arm.- The smallest size earbud cover is still a bit large for my ears.- You get a lot of wind and rubbing noise coming through the headphones..when the wind blows over your ears or when the cord rubs...which is all of the time! I think this is a feature of ear bud headphones in general though.For the price, I'm happy with these ear buds and actually bought some for my husband. Just know that they're not perfect or high end."
3,Great Sound but Need Some Work,"The sound from these headphones is incredible. The clarity and bass is the best I have ever heard from compact headphones. I use them for running, mountain biking, gym and rollerblading.The downside is the cord setup. Because one side is shorter than the other it tends to tug or pull on your ear. This becomes annoying after a while. The cord is also much too long. It has a connection to lengthen or shorten it but that ends up weighing down the cord and tugging on your ear more. I would buy these again IF they redesigned the cord."
4,Fit Like Earplugs,Great sound quality. The only problem is they fit so well that you can hear yourself breathing.
1,The wires disintegrate!,"I bought the MDR-EX51LP and wrote this review - it applies to the EX71 too.----------------------------------I liked these - they fit me well and sounded good. I can even sleep with them on.Unfortuneately, the insulation on the wire disintegrated within 4 months. It starts with a crack or tear where the wire meets the plug. Soon the insulation stretches, wrinkles, and delaminates until it comes off.I thought it was a freak accident so I bought the next step up as a replacement, the MDR-EX71SL. I'm sorry to report that the same thing happened to it - only within three months. I'm trying to find the warrenty information now so I can send them back.You can't buy these ear buds - you can only rent them until they sadly disintegrate around your neck."
4,Very good reference for movie buffs.,It is an excellent book. We only wish that it went back further to cover movies from the 50's and earlier.
5,"Wow, awesome, excellent!","I guess if you're watching or thinking about watching this DVD chances are you're already somewhat of a fan, but if you're not really a fan or maybe vaguely remember who they are it won't take much to convert you. Even if you're just in the mood for a good concert this DVD is so much fun, so entertaining,it is a beautiful jewel that you won't regret placing in your crown. Of course you'll also want to get the CD, but don't miss out on this passionate concert that encapsulates this great band in their loving city having one ecstatic celebration.I also understand Tim Booth is going to play a villian in Batman Begins. Hopefully it will generate more interest in this great band and this luscious concert."
3,Good for the price,"I bought this for my husband and he loved it at first but then I have not seen him use it again. its a great little stocking stuffer gadget that your golfer will like, but its not something that can be taken on and off very easily. He mostly used it on a club that he keeps in the house to practice his swings."
3,As described,"We could find no way to ""true"" the laser line once it was installed on my putter. In other words, after the laser is installed, which is very easy, we could not prove it was on ""straight"" therefore, we could not know if the laser was pointing in a ""true"" right angle to the putter. This may explain why the laser light did not meet the ground making it even more difficult to know if the putting stance and aim were right."
2,Disappointing,"Well, I thought this would be a clever book showing how to take the ubiquitous goods available to everyone at every local big box, and turn them into a stylish home. It's not what I expected... it's a few pages on several styles (salon style, bohemian, school house, swedish lite, island, new traditional... that's about half) and for each style there's a few photos showing what's available in mass retailers that suits that style. Not a bad notion, but executionally the concept is a little weak... many of the items in the photos don't ring especially true to the styles they're supposed to exemplify, and many of the tips could easily be gleaned from a (free) IKEA catalog. Sometimes I find that the pictures in a decorating book make it worth the price... not so here. The resources section in the back includes a selective listing of items shown... of the 4 things I was interested it, 3 weren't included in the listing. Wish I'd looked at it in person before I asked for it for Christmas!"
4,Great!,"Another great album from Avalon. The songs selection is great. A lot of rock-ish song, but they're great. I'm not a fan of rock songs, but I like their rendition.Most of the songs here have a very powerful lyrics, combined that with the powerful energy and harmony from Avalon, things are going great.I just wish that they can somehow get a varied and better song arrangers, it's a bit boring if they have the same style across the album."
4,comfortable,"Like most shoes under $80, this one isn't for walking a great distance nor standing all day... but if you're simply wearing it out for a couple of hours, it's very comfortable and very steady. I didn't need time to break into it."
3,Well...I have seen worse lol!,"**SPOILERS** What I liked about this film was mainly the scenery. It was shot in I believe Germany. Blood Trails is a different type of horror film about a girl being chased by bike (yes, bicycle) through the mountains after having a one night stand with a psycho cop. She is a bicycle messenger and he happens to be a...Bicycle cop. Yes, I know. However there are a few good kill scenes and the gore was decent. The acting is ok but sadly the people are idiots that could have avoided death quite easily had they used common sense. The scene where her boyfriend is killed should provoke a laugh. All in all though if you are looking for a no brainer horror flick this fits the bill. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars but it was a bit entertaining so..."
2,Disappointing,"There is a reason they don't show the woman's face on the cover, not very attractive. Lack of grooming was also an issue. Not sure what the ""welcomed consensus"" was trying to accomplish with this video. Arousal factor was non existent. Best suited for an anatomy class in some liberal college. Was going to share it with my wife but it is going in the trash."
4,Very Good,"The movie was very good, Steven McQueen gave one of his best performances. Some little details could have been changed but all in all it was worth the money and time to watch it."
3,Very weak about modern submarines,"I read this regular book, here in Brazil.This book is short, has many photos and is easy to read.The main problem of this book is to be very weak, about submarines after World War II.Being writen, more than 25 years ago, this regular book is also outdated."
3,Good book but not comprehensive,Expensive for what it is; there is much very good information but I would have liked to see more detail.
2,Skunk off,Shampooed the dog and she still smells like skunk. The internet remedy worked much better.Using the shampoo got rid of the oily substance but not the smell.
1,Better range units are out there,Changed my mind after finding out unit will not receive well where I work so returned it. The more RF around the less this unit works. I have to be next to the car to get it to receive at work. What good is a remote start if you have to be next to the car for it to work. Also I can't get it to work 200ft away in a small town open parking lot. I installed a Scytek 4000RS-2W-1 on our pickup and it works great.
3,Wrong Title,"Although this book contains an interesting collection of essays, it seems to be incorrectly titled. Because these essays are written by the writers themselves, they contain a type of tunnel vision into what it is like to live with a writer. The title would be more accurate had the essays been written by the people living with the writers. If you are looking for any type of advice about how to live with your writer partner, this book is somewhat lacking in objectivity. I don't think most writers fully understand what it is like to live with them and the sacrifices their partners make on their behalf."
5,wow,one of the best movies ever. since i was a kid it would come on every year (on free tv) and i would try to watch it. now i can see it 3-4 times a year! great for the whole family.
1,they did it again,"Having read the original story, this movie was a great disappointment, which I guess shouldn't surprise me. The damage done to Jules Verne's work is typical of the mess that Hollywood makes. Pat Boone is a fair singer, but should never have been cast in this. The original story was excellent, the movie is pitiful. Changing a German mineralogist into an overdone Scot, and adding Arlene Dahl to play a part that wasn't in the story makes me renew my pledge to NEVER watch what Hollywood does in the name of star power."
5,Excellent presentation!,"This particular presentation brings back Saturday afternoon with all the nostalgia of a matinee. The print is near perfect, the movie itself excellent and a real testimony to what was once a common product coming out of Hollywood. Thoroughly entertaining as family films once were. Perfect!"
5,Brings back my childhood dreams of far away places.,I saw the movie in the theater when I was ten. I am still in awe of the special effects. It rivals and in most cases surpasses todays special effects (except for computer generated images). James Mason was terrific with good support from Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl. To bad that do not make them like this anymore.
5,Classic video,I saw this movie on TV and wanted a good old fashioned adventure movie that the whole family could enjoy and the interest level is high for kids of all ages.
4,"Very, very good sound quality; don't expect to go jogging",Sound quality is the best I've heard for an earphones product. The only negative I have found is that they are nearly impossible to use while running.
5,water bottle,I liked this product. It didn't take long for my dog to figure out how to use it. I would recommend this product.
4,An obsession that leads to tragedy,"Story about theatre actor who gives himself so fully to the role that he starts to confuse his real life from his stage life. His only relief from the emotional pain is his love for his ex-wife. Although divorced, the two are still close firends and colleagues n the Broadway plays. His ex-wife knows best that he is emotionally fragile and is afraid to marry him again knowing that his emotional baggage will destroy this relationship again.When he takes on the role of Othello, his fame explodes. Night after night he plays a doomed lover. But his psyche starts to crack. In desparate effort to separate his love for his ex-wife for his love of Desdemona on stage, he commits murder against a young woman, played wonderfully by Shelley Winters.One has to have a love for old movies to watch this one. I loved the old black and white shots and the intensity of old school of acting."
2,Disappointing,I was hoping for a movie that pushed the envelope and what do we get? A futuristic drug dealers vs. the cops flick. Ho hum. It's an okay movie though. This is one of the few examples where the TV show was better than the movie.
4,Decent product.,"It arrived earlier than expected. Everything was intact. Take everyone's advice when taking this product. It is hot! If you don't have a tolerance for real spicy food, it can mess with your stomach! I started with weaker Cayennne capsules, then took the jump. Definitely take with a meal with protein, or take with a nice glass of milk!I haven't taken the product long enough to substantiate the claims the studies suggest. I can say that my circulation has improved a bit. Has had some nice side effects...I may write later to tell if it's been successful or not."
1,yuk,this stuff gave me hprrible heartburn. d not buy if you value your chest being normal. I do NOT reccommend.
5,Wonderful Fragrance at a great price!!,"This fragrance is lovely!! I have used Red Door for many years but was intrigued with this version since I had never heard of it. I read all the positive reviews and decided to try it since it was so inexpensive. What a nice surprise! I have fallen in love with this fragrance. It is sweet, feminine and sophisticated. And you can't beat the price! It is worth every penny and more! Just love it!"
3,Not bad,"First the goods: big bottle, good scent, cheap price, the Arden brand makes for a good gift :)The bads: The bottle is really simple...I would have liked something more fancy...its just like a glass box :| , the smell doesnt last very long...probably 2-3 hours and its not like the scent lingers after you pass through the corridor...its only when somebody comes close to you that he/she will be able to smell it.I think its just OK. Nothing great."
2,Faulty Construction,"I gave this as a Christmas gift for a 2 year old child. The handle kept coming off. I told the parents I would return the talking broom for a refund, but they had begun gluing the part(s) that kept coming dislodged. The faulty construction should be corrected---NOW, before the product injures a child."
4,Good for 1 cat,Good for traveling or for elderly people with 1 cat who don't have time to get to a store or lift litter.
3,disposable cat tray,"As expected....definitely not more than for an emergency....there's probably 1/2 cup of litter in each tray...but, it did the job nicely for the time we needed..."
5,FOR HOPELESS ROMANTICS ONLY!!!!!,FROM: Mr. James must be well pleased indeed. This soundtrack is simply superb. I felt romantically haunted by these selections which will do nothing short of transporting one back to the 1850's.
1,bubblegum pop metal,"for sale: a nonthreatening sense of safe, controlled rebellion and surrogate identity. condition: used, but painted like new. soul not included."
2,"Weak book, ill-fitting the Foundation series","I loved the Foundation series, but this book was weak, weak, weak. Hard-core Foundation fans will of course (have) read it anyway, but if you have any qualms about the original trilogy or are otherwise pressed for time (and who isn't?), don't bother with this one."
5,This is the kind of story that defies the silver screen.....,"To the utter frustration of HOLLYWOOD,astory was created that surpasses the mongral mind. Mr. Asimov has interwoven a plot that is mind-alteringly brilliant. Don't be supprised if you end up reading this more than twice!"
3,Interesting.,"Interesting but not as well constructed as his other books. In some instances does not seem to follow its predecessor, Prelude to Foundation which is by far a more superior work. Worth reading but not a classic"
4,september 11: an oral history by Dean E. Murphy,"this book, written by new york times reporter, murphy, is an int-grieging and sometimes horrible look back at the world that fell(most specically) into the collective laps of those living in manhattan, and to a lesser point, those people whose lives sur-rounded the day to day routine of the U.S. Pentagon. At timesthe portraits are of unparalled heroism, as well as fate, andhow, quite often, those fates intervened. Yes, we have seen thewall to wall television coverage ad nauseum, but this well con-structed history offers no art, no photos, no flight 93 heroes;but rather that of ordinary Americans facing the least ordinaryday in recent history. You'll come away saddened, but mostlikely, inspired.Due to graphic relevations of death and rescue efforts, I wouldcaution 18 and under to handle this book with care."
2,Eye-strainer,"The content was generally good, but my complaint is how the publisher set up the book. The introductory paragraph for each section was set in a font so faint that it strained my eyes to read it. The paragraph should have been set in bolf-face or at least italics and not in nearly invisible letters."
5,Wonderful Book,"This book is amazing. I wanted to learn more about synchronization on multiprocessor systems, this book covers that better than any other source I have found.If you want to understand SMP systems and the programming issues they cause, this is the book."
2,character flaws...,"i like the book but i found it hard to cheer for vinnie because she's so inconsiderate. She lives with nick for free and take advantage of the place and did not appreciate it. I know she's supposed to be a nice girl, kind and very compassionate and naive. Yet, she got mad at nick, brought all different kind of people to his place and leave a mess. I don't think someone with that kind of character will do such a thing. Anyways, the story was predictable and cute. But at the end i just hated her."
4,full of surprises,A great story--well told with the limitations of television (and a BBC budget) Clever twists and especially nice villains. It prompted me to re-read the book. (Which I read before seeing this series and enjoyed independantly)
2,Read the book,"No matter what anyone thinks of this title, no one will say that it is anywhere near as good as the book. The characters are poorly casted, the setting is not properly designed and the plot is a little screwy at time. If you want to truly visit Neverwhere you must read the book, which I find to be one of the greatest books ever written."
2,Hear me out...,"I loved the novel, sure. I give the novel five stars. But this is a movie we're reviewing here. So many people say you have to ""look past"" the acting, direction, production values, etc. But when you do that, all you're left with is a script. A book. Read the novel. The story is, in fact, amazing with great dialogue and characters. But as a movie, the production is quite poor. As for the great soundtrack, put in Brian Eno's album ""The Drop"" while you read the book and you will get the same effect. Enjoy!"
2,Waste of time.,This looks like something high school students would cook up in their film class. Cheap slapped together set and horrible acting to go with it. I absoluely loved the book. Apparently Neil Gaiman didn't fine tuned it until he wrote the book. I think this would have worked better with a bigger budget.
3,I think I'll read the book...,"Lucky for me, I borrowed this DVD set from a friend. As for my interest in the story, I was simply going on Neil Gaiman's previous works (Sandman, co-authorship of Good Omens). I had also just come off of seeing the BBC adaptation of Gormenghast, which I found to be exceedingly good.Neverwhere, on the other hand, was a major disappointment. The film has the feel of a soap opera, complete with cheesy sound effects and cut-rate action sequences; it reminded me of the old ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" movie (but not as good). The acting is decent, but unfortunately the overall 'feel' of the series is too cheap to be held up by acting alone.Since I haven't read the original novel I'm unable to comment on how well it was adapted for the small screen, but I have a feeling that the book has more depth than this offering of Gaiman's work. I would suggest reading the original first, and then giving this a try if you *really* like it."
2,What a Struggle,"This book was a real struggle to read. The authors thank their editor for helping to combine the writing of a Canadian and an Englishman, but as an American, I kept tripping over the excessive use of commas. Coupled with numerous typos, it was very hard to complete this book. While the authors disagree with Baigent and Leigh, I will credit the latter with providing footnotes, a more complete bibliography, and an index, all of which are missing from this book. This leaves me without much to pursue further. The real disappointment is the realization that this book is really only a part 1 of a story and all of the promises made to reveal things are left to the next book. I gave it the second star only because there actually are some original ideas presented here. Too bad the only way to continue to research their ideas is to take them on faith or wait for their next book. I hope they change editors before then and give us the benefit of some real references."
1,Absolute Drivel,"I just saw this movie on yesterday and I can't believe that this movie is on dVD while interesting flicks like In The Cold of the Night remain out of print! That the late great Mickey Rooney would involve himself in a project like this shocks me... to say nothing of another great, Frank Gorshin.The plot was paper thin and there was absolutely no suspense in the movie. The only thread that remotely interested me was which side Marc Singer was on. This was decided in the movie's climax, yet even that was dealt with insufficiently. Amazon is selling this for $50.00 new. I wouldn't buy it for half that price!! It is that horrible!A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."
1,very disappointing,People coming to Amazon to buy a package deal of the best 100 movies will be very disappointed to be re-directed here to just a single video instead of the package deal of 100 movies.
3,AFI will be selling all 100 videos,AFI is currently offering videos of all 100 movies to members. I assume the set will be available to the general public at some point in the future.
3,Quick Rainy Day Read,This book was nothing extraordinary but was a time filler for a rainy day or a day of traveling. It is some what predictable and it does not go too deep into the characters.
2,Chess games removed!,"If you want the chess games, don't get this edition. I just picked this up and started reading the introduction. As the introduction quickly summed up the entirety of the biography, I skipped to its end. There I was abhorred to discover that the editor had the audacity to get rid of the 60 chess games that comprised the Part II of the original edition. He mentions that all of the games can be found on the internet anyhow. I purchased this book thinking that the games would be included. Sometimes it's nice to sit with a book without the computer open and to be able to get what you want. My rating has absolutely nothing to do with David Lawson's biography which I have heard to be outstanding. It solely has to do with the 2010 edition edited by Thomas Aiello for the reasons mentioned above. Also, it does not have 430 pages. With the index included, 398. I will be returning mine for a refund."
1,Not so Great,"I don't like this game. I thought that it would be good because all of the other Army Men are good, But I was disappointed. You cannot battle the other person. On two player mode, both people work together towards the same goal on a split screen. It is very annoying. I don't recommend this game."
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"When i saw this game i thought it would be cool. it wasn't. the graphics were bad, i beat it the day i got it, and the multiplayer is horrible because you can't kill eachother. DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!! PLEASE!!!!"
3,A little too simple,"The game is fun overall, however some of the missions are far to easy, and then far too hard. Sometimes I'm never sure what to do. Me and my brother played together, and even then it seemed hard on many levels. However, once you complete a level you never really want to play again.Pros:1) Fun multiplayer game2) Many levels are funCons:1) Too easy2) I never really feel like playing again once I beat a level3) Just, boring after a while"
1,A horrible game!,"The controls are alkward, the graphics are blocky... It's obvious 3DO rushed this out. And that's coming from a big Army Men fan!"
4,Critics: What's your beef!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Horn. The scenery is marvelous, the storyline is good, and the movie says what it has to say without any more. Why do movie critics tend to condemn it?"
5,DVD Transfer,This movie is outstanding and a high quality DVD should be produced in no less than THX.
2,meh,just mediocre all around. some fine shooting scenes but that's about it. it was free. get what you pay for.
4,good western,I originally saw this movie in the theater. My date shouted out in the middle that he had seen it before and told me the ending. Wanted to see it again.
1,film of Dust,"I realize some people with poor judgment and rotten artistic taste have given this film up to five stars just because Tom Savini and Ingrid Pitt are in it. Don't be fooled.The acting is extremely unpleasant and I can't comment on the plot because there isn't one. Apparently who ever wrote this trash felt that, given enough blood and gore, no one would notice the lack of plot.Combine bad acting, worse camera work, and blatantly stolen scenes from Hammer films and you have a completely wasted effort.Believe me, do not take the raving reviews seriously like I did, this movie is a tremendous waste of your time. It is so bad I don't think Elvira would parody it if she were still around."
2,Savini Saves...,"SEA OF DUST is a silly fairy tale w/ loads of spurting blood, an ancient Ingrid Pitt, and Tom Savini nailed to a cross! Other, greater minds have figured this story out. I could make no sense of any of it. It had shades of Ken Russell's goofiness mixed w/ gothic stuff. Savini was in it for about a minute as a mythical character who flashed his cape around a lot. The main character was in the woods, then on a beach, then in a house, back in the woods, on the beach, etc. Wherever this thing was going, it took way too long to get there! Boring to the point of self-immolation, I nearly died! Good luck w/ this elephant turd..."
4,"Popcorn Movie, and then Some","This movie introduces Owen Wilson in the world of action stars. It is a different role than what he's used to, that be a comedic role in such films as ""Shanghai Noon"", ""Meet the Parents"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""Zoolander"" to name a few. In the end, he makes a great transition to this genre.This is basically a war thriller that keeps it pretty simple. He's an American pilot shot down in Eastern Europe, and he's trying to survive until help can get to him. The filming adds some Matrix-esque slowed down reality filming, and there's also some playing around with the audio, similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"" after being shell-shocked.Other than that, the film is a straight-forward, entertaining film. There is also a minor performance by Gene Hackman which is nothing special, but he adds to the whole of the movie.All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that moves quickly and is always keeping your attention with action and drama...a good film."
4,A good action movie that is at least worth a rental,"Sure Behind Enemy Lines may not have the best acting, but it does deliver what it intended to. That is a fun-filled movie with non-stop action and laden with special effects. I really enjoyed it and think that it is definately worth a rental. Although it may not be the most realistic of movies, it certainly is a wild ride. Check it out."
2,1/3 a movie,"In short, it has some nice cinematography and a very nice CGI shoot-down scene. Otherwize it was technically off, and for me, it's hard to take Owen Wilson as an action hero. He's great as a comedic actor and I'd be interested to see him in a serious role, but this wasn't quite right. Gene Hackman is, as always, great as the hard-nosed (insert rank here) military man."
3,It Should have been Better,"This film looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable."
2,Poor Blu-ray transfer,"I have the original dvd and purchased the blu-ray version. I like the movie, but the blu-ray video is no better than the original dvd. There isn't even any improvement in the sound since the original was DTS. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Yuck,"Someone tell me why Gene Hackman took this role. If you are looking for the Bosnian equivilant of ""Black Hawk Down"" you are looking in the wrong place. If you are into totally unrealistic, jingoistic, shoot em up movies war movies then this is for you."
4,Awesome picture quality,i loved this movie and when it went out in blu-ray i bought it since i didnt have it in dvd...picture quality was great specially the landmines scene and during the ending rescue...
1,"""Bottom Gun"" would have been a more apt title","Why Gene Hackman ever signed onto this horrible film is puzzling. I really enjoyed Hackman in BAT 21, but Behind Enemy Lines is too bad for even him to save. Simply, this film lacks any feeling of realism - More true-to-life aircraft combat sequences can be found in today's video games.It may be better than ""In the Army Now"" with Pauly Shore, but at least that was meant to be a war-comedy. This one just falls so [heavy] on its face that one can't help laughing at it."
2,Hooray for Our Side!!,"Watch Owen Wilson run! Watch him outwit those ... foreigners! Watch him bring truth and justice to war-torn Eastern Europe! The problem is that this film is actually not too bad, it's just that sometimes I feel the need to be wrapped around the American flag while I watch parts of it. There are some good action sequences in this film, like the one where he's walking through a minefield but there are other parts of the film that are so heavy-handed they make me groan. But ""Behind Enemy Lines"" does answer one question: Can Owen Wilson act? Answer: Owen Wilson is one of the worst actors on the planet Earth."
1,Forget this one!,"Very, very slow moving ... at times hard to follow/stay focused. The point of the movie is that terrorism is bad, it destroys lives, and guilt makes one do odd things - that's it.Forget this one unless you need someting to help you fall asleep."
5,JUST what I needed!,"I am getting married in just a few months and needed a guide to answer some basic questions. This book was easy to read and gave me so many great ideas that I now feel ready to plan and execute a personal, fun wedding day. The advice was right from the people who had ""been there"" and their hindsight went a long way in making me feel better about the decision I was trying to make. I highly recommend this book"
2,4 Ingredient Cookbook,"Great seller! I was dissapointed in the cookbook however. I thought that with 4 ingredients there would be more ""homey"" recipes, but most of them are rather pretentious."
3,"it is ok, but","it is ok,but i waited two day for this and isn't what the title says. there is a tag that came with it.it said that it is a 40020 g.i type enhanced canteen cover od <meaning olive drab. i like but it wasn't what i had in mind. warning it is a canteen cover not a but pack. but you can use it as one. i am also place pics to show what it looks like.:)"
4,"Worth ORDERing, if you like fun action movies","I'll keep it short. The Order is a very good light hearted summer type action movie. Don't expect too much from it and you should enjoy it. Just take it for what it is, not what its not. And it [stinks] that there are no special features except three trailers."
5,I love this camera,This is the best camera ever. I've had many cameras before this one and this one takes the cake. It takes professional quality pictures but is very easy to use. If I took the time to go over all of the functions on this camera you'd be reading for hours. All that I have left to say is great camera!
1,Black Screen - No Picture on LCD,"I've owned the S2 for a little over two years and have had the black screen of death problem for the second time last month. When using the camera it appears that the iris or shutter gets stuck closed and no image appears on the LCD screen. The first failure occurred just before the 1 year warranty period was over so was covered under the warrany, but the camera failed again recently and Canon wants $129 to repair it or $190 to upgrade to an S3. The S3 seems to suffer from the same problem, so that's not a very good option. Spending more money to repair the camera doesn't seem very good use of money either since it most likely will fail again in a year or so anyway."
3,"Loved it, while it worked","I bought this camera 3 years ago,and while it worked I absolutely LOVED it! It took pictures that could be put in magazines, but then about 3 months ago I started getting the dreaded black screen.For awhile I could turn the camera off and back on and take a few pictures before the screen went black again, but now it has blacked out for good.I'm searching for a new camera, and I'm scared to buy another Canon because with all the people that has got the ""black"" screen this HAS to be an internal problem with the camera that Canon fails to acknowledge."
4,Gives me a warm feelng,Love this camera. Just wish i could charge the batteries in the camera.Also would like to see a better usb door.Fred
4,Excellent camera for non or semi professional use,"I love this camera, provably S3 IS is the option now. It takes very nice photos in auto and custom modes. Cons are little slow to take unexpected events and difficult to fix manual focus"
5,Fantastic,I have always been artsy but I am not a photographer in any way shape or form but this camera changed that I get the most amazing shots and love it this is my first real camera buy aside from those slim digital's and I am not sorry about the purchase I recommend this camera for all stages from beginner to professional its really a fantastic buy
1,Beware Canons are DEFECTIVE!!!!,"Like many other reviews, my camera came down with the black screen of death. Canon says that it isn't a problem with the S2 and never issued a recall (despite 30-50 reviews on amazon to the contrary). They are offering a trade in for one of three cameras that all have owners reporting similar or other issues (G11, SX10 IS, or Rebel XS). I am so sick of talking to clueless service reps on the phone. I have had issues with some Sony products (mainly PS3) but they seem to take care of business better than Canon, so I think it's time to switch to a Sony camera."
3,"Great Pictures, but died in less than 2 weeks","The Good:While it worked, it took fantastic pictures.The 12x zoom is great.The image stabilization works perfectly.Uses AA batteries.The Bad:The 1.8"" LCD is too small.The autofocus is slower than my Nikon.You can't have the LCD and viewfinder on at the same time.It died after less than 2 weeks, 3 days into a once in a lifetime vacation. Thank goodness, I brought my Nikon too.Really Good:Amazon issued credit without any problem.I'm replacing it with the Panasonic DMC-FZ7S. I haven't got it yet, but will review after I've had it a few weeks."
2,dark spot,"I purchased Canon Powershot S2 IS 3 years ago.This camera was a great product until 2 years ago I noticed there was always a dark spot (>5% of the whole field) located at the center of the view of movies that I took outdoors, especially with sunshine. The spot just gradually shown up after several seconds when the lens pointed to bright background.Now that dark spot becomes darker and bigger and even appears when I take pictures and movies indoors.I think certain areas of the digital film in the camera was damaged and desensitized.I'm unwilling to spend at least half of the price of the whole camera to replace the digital film."
1,canon does not support their products,"I purchased a Canon SI IS and have sent it to their Factory Service center twice, it is still not working right. Now that it is off warranty their answer is for me to purchase a ""refurbished"" S2 IS for $199...Their support of their products is terrible, this camera has not worked right since I bought it and they dont care! Do yourself a favor and buy a Panasonic product, they make great products and they support them, unlike Canon"
3,Not at all impressed,I am not a professional photographer but I do have specific needs in which MOST digital cameras do not meet. This happens to be one of those cameras. I do not like the fact that there is a delay between releasing the shutter and getting the shot. I have bought 3 digital cameras and have returned all of them for this reason. I am going back to film but if anyone can recommend a camera that can perform this feature that would be wonderful
1,Great until it STOPS WORKING,I bought it -- I loved it.I cared for it -- it died the 'BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH'I had to PAY MORE -- to resurrect it {Canon now says when told that so many others have issues with this camera -- well all the issues aren't the same one -- just like people get sick from the flu or the cold so too people are getting it 'cured' for different reasons -- as IF THAT HELPS! So instead of it having ONE FLAW it has NUMEROUS potential AILMENTS.I decided -- if CANON can't stand behind their product... I'm NOT standing in front of Canon display cases/products when making a purchase.
4,I like it,"I like this camera who realy needs more than 5MP anyway I dont, great movie mode can shoot a long video wont need my old camcorder anymore this works fine for how I use it. The only thing I cant do with this camera drop it in my shirt pocket like my other canon. No camera is perfect this one's fine."
5,Still Going Strong,"I just thought I'd speak up for this camera in case there are those who are tempted to purchase a used version. For $300+ brand new here on Amazon in 2005, this camera has delivered. No black screen of death (yet) and this camera has been around the block a few times, including getting beach/boat time in Mexico some years back. What drew me to the camera was: AA batteries, viewfinder, zoom (good for its time; admittedly, I'm tempted by the newer cameras), video with very decent sound, the swiveling LCD screen (comes in extremely handy). Whenever I take it on vacation, I still carry the book with me. So much electronics and so many icons icons, I can better operate an old fashioned film camera. One thing I absolutely swear by are the Energizer e-series lithium batteries. They last forever."
2,Great till the E18 error,"Awesome camera till it dies, NOW I read online all about E18.... discouraged... google Canon E18 and you will see also"
2,Not what I expected,"I felt a bit misled with this book. The back cover and inside blurb focused on a lockdown situation, which sounded like a great suspense situation and I was looking forward to reading the book. Then, absolutely nothing happens for the first 300 pages! Basically nothing much at all, just lots of short chapters, and tons of characters, none of which we really get to know well enough to enjoy their company or care about. Then it's in the last 50 pages of the book that we finally get to the lockdown situation, and it's just a letdown, no big drama whatsoever, and the story just fizzled out.I read another book over the weekend, Temporary Sanity by Rose Connors, that honestly blew this one out of the water. She is like a female John Grisham, and you really get to know and care about the people in her book, which is what was missing with this one."
4,Great Fun!,"How delightful to read this story and see the better aspects of stressed personalities emerge! There is a little bit of this heroine in all of us, as we struggle with the 'what if's' and 'maybe's' of our growing-up years, all the while trying to reconcile how we THOUGHT we were perceived with how we actually are...if we are lucky, we realize much of the pressure is self-inflicted! There is much here about human quirks and insecurities, while keeping it fun reading, thoroughly enjoyable!"
3,"God is everywhere, but takes an open mind to find.","This book is good for cultivating an open mind, and accepting (as Jesus did) differences in opinions as being healthy to growth and well-being.The different Attributes given to ""Know God"" are the prime exmple of this. People have different personalites for differnt reasons -- but the ubnerlying reality is that we are all people. We will be healthy, as a species (Flock, if you prefer) if we incorporate and harmonize with these different viewpoints -- i.e. each other.Anyone giving this book less than 3 stars must not have looked very hard; or is perhaps frustrated with their own inability to find a rewarding answer. Clearly, this book is well thought out, and helpfully informative in some way, as it does cover (although more broad than deep) many different subjects.See Dennet's ""Consciousness Explained"" for an also ambitiously titled. yet more thorough approach to a rather similar topic"
4,How To Know God,"I really enjoyed reading this book,it gave me a better understanding of god and myself"
4,ambitious but very thought-provoking,"Deepak Chopra has aptly navigated the treacherous road of revealing God in a form which defies any singular religion's definition of Him. In the process, he has not as many might, avoided the topic of religion... rather he has initimately woven the teachings of many major religions into his writings in a way which respects rather than challenges them. For this feat he has won my admiration. For his thoughts on God, he has won my curiosity. A good read for those who are not Oxford Philosophy Professors but are bent on pursuing the answers to the seemingly unanswerable questions of the universe."
3,Pros and Cons,"I found the book provocative and enlightening, but also repetitive and murky in some areas. There's much to be gained from reading this and, depending upon where you are on the path, it may well change your life. But although most of the book was clear and accessible, there were other parts that I wish had been explained more simply and succinctly. Without at least some understanding of Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum physics, portions of this book will be difficult for many readers to plow through ..."
1,This one is shame on me,"I ordered this to replace my copy that was borrowed and never returned. It's my fault for not reading the fine print and noticing that the book's size was only a few inches, and abridged.The original book is one of the best I have ever read, and I'm pretty open on this subject so I read a lot...but I can't seem to find a use for this tiny little thing.If you're looking for a minature, abridged copy of the original, go for it. Otherwise, order the full book on Amazon. A soldiers Bible is bigger than this thing! But as I said, this mistake's on me."
2,Chopra crossed his own line here,This new book has been marketed very well and I know why. It lacks intrinsic strength. Better read the books of Neal Walsch. These have more depth.
5,Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places....,"Am a little over half-way through the book. I have been reading in the last several years various titles on religion, spirituality, and quantum physics. Having been raised a Catholic, including Catholic schools, I was taught to believe that it is the One True Church. I never really bought the program, though. Dr. Chopra's book is helping me to pull all my thoughts together in a most profound way. Interestingly enough, a few days ago, I read where scientists discovered that humans share several genes with the fruitfly. This is so amazing. To a skeptic like myself, Dr Chopra's scientific approach is very satisfying. I think looking for god all around me is the answer, not in religion."
1,journey,brothers and sisters please dont judge this man gain positive feelings out of it and move on to the next book the ansers are limitless stay openminded and follow your soul& please dont judge the spelling does it really matter to be perfect thankyou i love u
1,Wake up!,"Deepak Chopra has some good ideas - however, they are that - ideas. This book is a grand way for him to make more money saying the same thing he's already said in his other books. I wonder if he has studied the Bible and the life of Christ? This book fits in with all the new ageism that deceives our world. We are not GOD. We can create things, but not the heavens, nor the earth, nor the breath of life. I look forward to Deepak Chopra gaining ""true"" insight from God, through his holy spirit. Chopra just helps keep lost souls in bondage."
2,I don't get it.,"I'm a huge fan of Jarrett's standards trio work, his classical/baroque stuff, and, less consistently, his solo improvisational concerts. The 1994 Box Set of the trio's Blue Note dates and his rendering of Shostakovich's Preludes and Fugues are ""desert island"" discs. But I don't get it when great artists like Jarrett (and Pat Metheny, to cite another example) sometimes release this dissonant, anti-melody stuff. Is it hard to play this? Probably. I don't know since I'm not an accomplished musician. But it sure isn't very pleasant to listen to. Isn't that, at bottom, what music is supposed to be? Pleasing to listen to? It seems that the musicians themselves comprise the biggest group of people who enjoy this stuff. Maybe it is fun to play it; who knows. But I'll be selling this one used soon."
1,Warning -- Dissonance Ahead,"Keith Jarrett's music is (usually) a gift to the world. Is there anyone else whose head and fingers seem as directly sourced to the essence of what music is and why humans like it? Two of my favorite pieces of recorded music are by Jarrett: Live at the Blue Note box set, and Shostakovich's Preludes & Fugues Op. 87 -- both simply ethereal works. But Inside Out is, well, awful. No discernable melodies. Unpleasant dissonance reigns. You know, Pat Metheny -- who I similarly think is as close to the muse as Jarrett -- does this stuff occasionally too. Maybe it's me. I'm not an accomplished musician. Accomplished musicians seems to rave about each other when they do this atonal stuff. To me, it's annoying noise. What a disappointment."
4,All about the North Node,"If you've ever wanted to learn just what a ""North Node"" means in an astrological chart and what it can do for you, this is the book for you! This astrological discusses what each North Node position means in great detail and she does not mince words about the negative traits associated with any position. (My North Node is in Libra, and she had a lot of choice things to say about those of us with this position.)I will be checking to see if she has any more books available. I'd like to see what she has to say about other astrology-related topics."
5,The Missing Piece for students of Astrology!!! A Must Have!!,"This is my 2nd copy of this book. When I first purchased it a few years back, I couldn't put it down!!!I knew barely a thing about the Nodes and was amazed at the impact and influence regarding Karma.What I read about my Node for the first time, it was like the first time I had experienced Astrology itself. Instant Awareness and Connection to the Source.What amazed me the most was how long I had gone unaware of this aspect of the Astrology Chart and its importance.This book is an ABSOLUTE MUST! for anyone learning about Astrology. Your study will remain incomplete without the knowledge of the Nodes and their influence in our lives."
5,Great Stuff,"The ReplayTV unit is fabulous. Unbelievably easy to use, it not only works flawlessly, but it does more than we saw advertised and written about it. It's better than TiVo because it doesn't spy on your behavior and it has no monthly cost. If I have to pick nits, it would be easier to enter titles if the remote worked like most cell phones for text entry, rather than using arrows to guide a cursor over a keyboard image, and, the instruction manual should be better indexed. However, these things apply mostly to the initial setup and not to ongoing use, so, we are completely satisfied and have no second thoughts whatsoever. This is what you want."
3,Replay Tv,"I was very impressed with this device. It will tape things you like even if you don't know they're on. I love it except for one flaw but to me a fatal flaw. It runs off of TV schedules which aren't always set in concrete. In the short time I have had it, I taped a football game that went a few minutes past the scheduled time. In this particular case it was no problem but how would you like to miss the game winning kick or TD.On another occasion, I watched a movie (action) where the finale was cut off also because the movie (actually the previous one) ran a little longer then programmed. Thus in the first week of ownership, two shows that I had wanted to watch were cut short.I wll buy this equipment in the future when they allow a buffer time for shows to be recorded."
3,"Its okay, but TiVo is better....","The ReplayTV boxes are good, but for boxes that do essentially the same thing (and, in the long run, cost essentially the same amount), the TiVo wins on user friendliness and support."
3,"Yes, indeed he does...","In big words at the top of the original Kull movie poster were two words: ""KULL ROCKS"". And judging from this soundtrack, that's a pretty accurate description. (Never mind the fact that while watching this movie, I couldn't help but see Hercules on the screen instead of Kull; damn you, Sam Raimi!) It's a rarity (at least, it was when this movie came out) to hear an orchestra over hard rock guitar riffs, and Joel Goldsmith does a good job blending the two. Most of the music is pretty standard fantasy-type stuff, but when the guitars and drums kick in, it got my blood pumping. My personal favorite tracks are ""Kull's Initiation"" and ""Ship Brawl"". ""Deep Freeze"" (the main battle music) is a standout as well. So does Kull rock? On some tracks...well, just read the title of the review."
2,Not sure,"Purchased two of these one worked perfectly until it was dropped inadvertenlty, the 2nd didn't light up at all. Amazon exchanged it but the replacement did not light up either. I had heard good things about this light as my older ones (different brands) kepts failing after only a couple of months. I ended up switching to a blue light we will see how long this one lasts."
3,My First Disappointing Experience with Zelazny,This is by far the worst book I have read that was written by Zelazny. The story goes on and on without really getting anywhere and did little to hold my interest. The one redeeming aspect of this book and probably the only reason I finished it was the use of Edgar Allen Poe as one of the characters. Zelazny attempted to portray the true misery of Poe within the telling of this fictional story. The portrayal is good unfortunately the story itself does not live up to my expectations.
2,Hero's behavior is unheroic,"This is another romance about a hero who feels betrayed and thus treats the heroine like dirt. Rogan believes (wrongly, of course) that the heroine plotted to have him thrown into the dungeon. He kidnaps her, berates her, belittles her, forces her to toil at many jobs...Lily puts up with so much that I found her unbelievable. The Medieval era was not for wimps. She could have been more strongly drawn.The less said about the too evil to be believed evil sister, the better. Why do the other characters never figure out that they have evil incarnate in their household?This writer has potential. Overall, her writing style is smooth. Rogan is also more sympathetic than similar heroes from the 1980s. If only she would write stronger characters...I gave this book a D- at All About Romance."
5,Terrific TV Mini-Series From the 80s.,"Brian Dennehy plays John Wayne Gacy, the serial killer of over 25 young men and boys. The movie in a low key manner examines how the case unfolded with Gacy being connected to a missing boy who left a drug store to speak to him about work to the discovery of dead bodies in his home. Using the police investigation to highlight how Gacy was caught reveals the conflict and in police work and how investigative techniques evolved in order to catch serial killers."
2,"Too short, not in order, titled weird.","Well, first of all, this movie has delightful music, unfortunately much of which has been left out. Secondly, I'd enjoy hearing the music moreso in the order of the movie. Although I realise <I>Into It</i> was an extremely short sequence in the beginning of the movie, it should have been put with <i>I Have Not Been to Paradise</i> at maybe track 3 or 4. Maybe a remix of <I>Into It<i> would have been suited better for the end of the album. Well, enough of my blabber ;-)"
3,also known as 'The Mother',"I bought this movie because my girlfriend (who is Thai) was telling me that it's based on a true story and extremely scary. While it is based on a true story, I didn't find this film to be scary in the slightest. A good film for those who are interested in thai film and for those who don't enjoy overly scary films."
3,Spooky atmosphere!,"Thailand is getting in on the Asian horror action and is getting better at it all the time. I saw this film some time ago and can't remember a lot of details but I can say that it captured creepy quite well. The dark lighting, the hospital itself, the fact that Por is in danger from her boyfriend, all add to the atmosphere and create a nice little thriller. The film keeps you jumpy trying to guess when the next scare will be and where it will come from as it could be a murderous drug-dealing ex-boyfriend or a ghost that seems to want something from Por.Rent it, buy it or borrow it; I think you might be pleasantly surprised!"
2,adissage slide,"I found these to be very uncomfortable in a short period of time. I know they are supposed to massage your feet, but for me, they just hurt after 30 minutes."
1,Wrong Item,The item that was order and expected was not what I received. This was a very big dissapointment on Christmas morning when presents were being opened.
2,Not as comfy as I remember them,"I bought these to replace my black ones that were lost years ago and so far they aren't nearly as comfortable. They may take a few more months of breaking in, but I dont remember the other ones hurting this much to begin with :("
3,It's ok for guys.,Well i bought this product in black and white when they came they are too THICK at the soles. Makes me feel like im wearing those workout shoes. Ive worn them before so i can't return them. Wearing them without socks hurts like ***** but they are durable and the black and white color LOOKS GOOD ON GUYS NOT LADIES !!! so LADIES get PINK AND WHITE
2,wrong color,i was disappointed in the color of the adidas women's sandals that I ordered. It looked like they were black and white (not pink) in the picture. I chose not to pay the postage to return them.
4,In the beginning ... painful,"When I first wore these sandals, the pain was pretty intense. I had to wear them with heavy socks for quite awhile. I am now able to tolerate them without socks, but it was a process to reach this point. I bought them to use around the pool as I did not want my feet sliding out of a regular pair of flip flops and on to extremely hot concrete. They work very well for this, but I would not wear them to go shopping or walking any long distances.UPDATE: I have gotten used to these sandals. I do use them for shopping now. 4 out of 5 stars."
5,good sandals,Very nice sandal and very quick shipping love them...I have bought them before and wish I could wear them all year they are so nice
2,Huge Disappointment,"I have been wearing these type of sandals for many years, the brand I loved quit making them and I have been searching for a suitable replacement since, the big problem with these Adidas is the half dollar size logo at the heel right where there should be massaging ""nubs"" I feel the logo with every step I take. What I don't understand is the decision in the design department that thought this was a good idea since there is a huge logo going across the front of the foot, what's up with that? I will be continuing my search for the best replacement for my old ones as these do not cut it!"
4,great vacuum,This is a wonderful vacuum. I didn't have any expectations when I bought it. I have dogs one being a big time shedder. My previous vacuum was a miele which cost the earth and didn't pick up the dog hair well and I was not at all happy with. The suction on this vacuum is wonderful. i have four sets of stairs and the attachment works well. This vacuum is lightweight and compact to store. the end result is I am happy to vacuum and my carpets look great. my only wish is that the vacuum bags had a bigger capacity
3,great for newbies :-\,"I dont go to a college/university for jazz (although i do wish i did), so i got this book with the hopes of getting some more depth than your average wikipedia article. I was disappointed. This book gives you a good elementary introduction to everything, but unfortunatly does not go in depth at all. Or perhaps there really isnt that much to talk about when it comes to jazz history (but most of me refuses to allow myself to convince myself that that is true). Or maybe im a genius...? Nah...If you're a jazz novice, this is a good book for you. If you are a musician who knows more than your average person, but wants to know more...i wouldn't neccesarily recommend this book. There are probably better books out there."
4,The young team almost get it perfect...,"And so here are Mogwai. A scottish band with a totally original style, no-one can decide weather they are rock or dance, but originality is not always good. These guys pull it off, and this is an album which compliments everyone's collection. In particular check out the brilliant mix of Summer... I can not decide if it is better than the original version (as seen on Young Team). In the end, if you have Young Team and like it then definately buy this. If you do not have Young Team, then buy it first.Dee"
3,"Good value. Decent book. Reprinted as ""Chess"" in hardcover.","The 1st edition has been reprinted in hardcover and is now called ""Chess"" by Graham Burgess. As chess instruction books go, this is average at best, but it is a good value for the money. However, it is not so good for beginners.The best thing about the book are the descriptions of plans for various openings, and typical traps. So this is a very good book for trying new openings.The 2nd edition has more current info on computers, but that section is really unnecessary anyway.The rest of the book has decent material, enough to last you quite awhile, but nothing that will give you any epiphanies.By the way, the companion (still out-of-print as of October 2003) games collection, Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games, is a truly excellent book for intermediate players."
3,GUILTY PLEASURE,"These little movies, which seem much more dated, content-wise and technically, than 1995, are like really good junk food -- you will enjoy every minute, but they will not stay with you. Each one begins and builds like classic gay porn movies, except of course these little films are tastefully erotic, and tell stories of both requited and unrequited love, and of the trials and tribulations of growing up gay. The performances are uniformly unintentionally hilarious, particularly the mother in the final ""Disco Years"" movie."
1,No Photos In This Edition,NO PHOTOS in this book about macro photos made it a waste of money. I would explore other editions of this book rather than buying this one.
3,Book of Monsters,"I have not finished this yet. This was one of my first attempts of ordering and it was not what I thought it was, my fault."
5,PARTY!,"An absolutely sublime collection of obscure, swingin' instrumental gems from the 50s and 60s. Cheesy, goofy, campy....music that will go down great at any party you might throw. Some of the recordings are a bit scratchy, like they've been recorded directly from the original vinyl records, but this just adds to the delightfully trashy ambience. Not a bad track in the bunch, but the CD would be worth owning for The Hollywood Persuaders' rockin' ""Drums-A-Go-Go"" alone.Looking forward to getting all 6 volumes."
1,Why is this not available in the US?,"Please explain why this is NOT available in US? I would like to purchase it. It IS a Kindle version in other countries, is it not?"
4,Actually Kept My Interest.....,"Ok - I'm not going to rehash the plot - you can read other reviews for that. I will tell you that this was an entertaining movie that held my interest. I did enjoy seeing Greg J. from CSI make some cameo appearances and Hally is lovely to watch, Bruce always wicked and I, personally, was kept guessing until the end, thought I had the answer, then the end kicker. With some movies and however I'm feeling at the moment, I just let them carry me along and not overanalyze it. This was the case with this movie at this time. Take that for what you will...."
1,idiots and lonely boys of course would like this,"toss every bad idea in a hat,shake it,start grabbing and you can make perfect stranger part 2.there will be a mighty war between this crap and that lilo p/o/s ''i know who killed me'' for worst movie of this decade."
3,Perfect Crazy Strangers,Perfect Stranger is a strange movie. what I couldn't understand was when Bruce Willis accused of a crime he didn't commit why didn't he protest. He didn't say a word and let the courts send him to jail. But Hallie played a good psycho. the ending will surprise you!
4,Halle does it again!,"Halle Berry delivers another ""Killer"" performance. Bruce Willis is a favorite of mine as well so this was quite the treat for me. Very smart & sexy film. Loved it!"
3,"Not bad, but....","For most of the movie, the storyline seemed to drag along quite a bit. It almost lost me until the ending, when it seemed like 60 minutes of information was given to you in 10 minutes!! A good thriller, but very slow in my opinion..."
1,Heresy,"I've read many books I disagree with, but few as fervently as this. As an American Anglo-Catholic, I'm absolutely astounded to read this damnable work."
2,"""Lame Mask Looks Nothing to the Picture""","So i bought this mask because it looked freaking awesome--but was very disappointed. The colors of the mask are way off. which really make it look ""fake"" It looks nothing to what the picture looks like. i would not recommend anyone to buy this item. the material is also very cheap. in the end i want my money back."
3,"Very lovely it is, but not very useful","This book is a beautiful piece of publicity for Vera Wang but the scope of content is rather myopic. I enjoyed seeing the brides Vera Wang has dressed, but was pretty disappointed with the amount of actual content for those planning a wedding. The book as a graphic piece is exciting and wonderful; the use of overlays is ethereal. But if one is trying to get to the details of wedding planning in anything but a very formal city affair, one should seek a different resource. The guidelines are far too sparse in this one."
5,"Beautiful pictures, beautiful pages, BEAUTIFUL VERA!!!!!","Every advice on wedding you need!! It's really awesome, fantastic, I really really love Vera Wang, she gave me lots of ideas to create magnificent weddings!!! (I'm an aspirant wedding planner)"
2,Wasn't impressed,"I'm sure in its time many years ago this book was fabulous. Its definitely not timeless! I was not impressed, thankfully I bought it used. There are a lot of good books on the subject out there, this is not one of them."
2,What was wrong the night of this performance?,I am a fan and have all of Norah's CD's and DVD's in this DVD Norah did not seem her her usual humble self - has she become a diva or did she have an argument with the band on the way to the show? The songs seems rushed and detached as if the performance was an obligation to get over with - she even made a comment as if the audience was not into the show -I know I was not. I would love to know what was wrong that night and I hope it was temporary issue that has been worked through.
5,Norah Jones,"What can be said about Norah Jones that isn't positive? Her voice, her lyrics, her delivery, her music - all first class."
4,Good for the DIY weekender project,"For occasional use, this carpenter apron is fine. It is not heavy enough for constant use, but gets the job done for those weekend projects. For the cost, it's a decent buy."
2,Pretty much low quality,"I started to work as a carpenter but mostly inside, so I don't carry so heavy gears. But after less than 1 month of daily use, one of the pockets had come undone, after the rivet went broken. So I would say :-the rivets and sewed parts are weak-the belt is too big for thin waist (I wear 28""). But if you do another hole yourself it's OK.-hammer loop is too large for indoor small hammer so it keeps falling through it. And too low also, I prefer on the waist because as it is on this belt, hammer hits my calf all the time.-the 2 largest pockets are very tight so that even if I wear thin gloves I can't reach the bottom. Only medium size tools can fit in, like speed square and a pair of pliersSo it's cheap, don't expect quality and avoid for intensive use...."
1,beware: it's not lana's movie!,"Buyers beware! I bought it from two different sellers, and it seems they don't know that, while cover on slipcase refers to the earlier movie with Lana Clarkson, the tape inside includes just Ted Mikel's ""The Doll Squad"" retitled ""Female Mercenaries"". If any seller is sure, having verified on tape, that the movie is Lana's one, please let me know!"
4,A Good Introductory Book,"A good introductory book - if you already have a good background in C/C++. Otherwise, you'd be struggling and may need some other really basic books to complement your reading.Most books have erratas and this book is no exception. However, it is minimal and acceptable."
5,"A brave, original, and shocking novel","Dennis Cooper is an incredibly brave and original writer. His books, however, are not for the faint of heart. ""Guide"", which is part of a five book cycle that also includes ""Closer"", ""Try"", ""Frisk"", and ""Period"", is my favorite of his novels because he dares to include himself in the middle of his usual tales of drugs, abuse, exploitation, violence and depravity. He ingeniously draws from an article he wrote for ""Spin"" magazine about a handful of teenage runaways, and blends reality, fiction and fantasy to create a shocking and original novel. Is what takes place in ""Guide"" a truthful look into Cooper's own fantasy life? Or is it merely his way of showing how society sexually exploits and degrades young people? It's up to the reader to decide."
3,Decent,"The good thing about this polish/wax is that it doesn't dry up white, just a true haze, so it doesn't get stuck on edges and grooves like other car waxes. Those who wax their cars know exactly what I'm talking about. Overall, this is a good polish. My car is shiny now. But does it do a good job hiding scratches, swirl marks, blemishes? Not really. Mind you, my car is fairly new and the scratches and blemishes I'm talking about are not deep scratches at all. It did hide them, but only a little bit. I wouldn't say they're invisible, but it's a good alternative to having to get a paint job or something. I'm going to keep using this product. Maybe after a few coats of this, it'll keep making the car look and shine better. The chipstick...well, I don't know if I'm just not going over some scratches enough, but it's not a miracle worker. Again, it's decent, but not that great. I'd keep using it just to see if layering it would work for me better."
3,Messy wax,"This wax is very messy. Due to the dye in product anything you use to apply and buff off product will have to be thrown out. If you dont wash your hands immediately your hands are dyed!! How do you do that when youre trying to wax car? The chipstick works ok but make sure surface is warm for ok results. The wax works well and gives a nice slick feel, just be very careful with product!"
5,best so far,The examples shown in this book are rusty as hell and this goes a long way in giving you the confidence to try the skills shown in bringing them back to life. As far as diy bodywork books go this is the best on the topic so far. I can actually afford all the tools used in this book and that is one major reason why it gets 5 stars.
1,DOA Truck Pac Battery Booster,Purchased new and Clore Automotive refuses to replace DOA batteries. Clore Automotive said the dealer should have sold the product within six months of accepting delievery form the manufacture. Since the manufacture date was greater than six month the unit fail to qualify for manufacture warranty. I am now out $235 and Clore Automotive made a two time profit from me. I am now in the market for a new battery charger and you can bet it will not be another Clore Automotive manufacture defective un-warranty piece of junk.ThanksLack of Customer Service Clore Automotive for showing me the light.
2,es 6000 battery pack,"My second one of the Es 6000 battery packs has just went bad.This one lasted three years of easy use.They work fine till the battery's go bad,then it cost as much for the battery's as the whole thing."
5,Cult [IMPORT] ~ Apocalyptica,"I own the other two cds (metallica by four cellos, and inquisition symphony) they are both the best cd ever made in my opintion. Apocolyptica are dimigods to many people. This cd is the best one they made yet due to that they came up with most of the songs on there own. The songs Hall of mountain king and Path arte very good. I urge you if you like Rock you will love this. Cult by Apocolyptica."
5,I opened it and laughed out loud,"This collection of cartoons is hilarious. I picked this book up from the table at a garage sale and randomly turned to a page where the caption is ""Intellectual."" It shows a naked man on his hands and knees with a pipe running directly from his backside to a helmet on his head. He has a goatee and is smoking a pipe. There is a bookshelf containing books with titles like, ""The Intellect"", ""Das Intellect"" and ""Intellect."" I laughed so hard the woman running the sale asked me what I found so funny. Needless to say, I had to buy the book. While the other cartoons didn't quite generate that extreme reaction, I laughed my way through the book. If you are looking for more yuks in your life, then this book will satisfy that craving."
5,"Inspirationl, wonderful. I loved it.","I loved this book. I could not put it down. I read it in 2 day and plan on reading it again. I shared this book with my family, who also loved the book and fell in love with Elda. What a remarkable woman and an inspiration to us all. I recommend this book to everyone. Read it to yourself or read it out loud to your children. A must for everyone who has ever loved, lost or faced a difficult situation. Thank you Elda and Patricia for sharing your life with us.Louise Cavallo"
5,"Engaging read, start to finish","I loved how Elda's story unfolds. From her early childhood memories in Italy, through her young adulthood in fabulous San Francisco (before, during and after the depression), then marriage, family and ""everyday"" life, her life seems anything but ""everyday"" when you read it.Patricia Henley's ability to draw you in to all of the characters is wonderful. I felt like I knew everyone in Elda's family, and that I was dancing along with her on her ""fancy"" dates in San Francisco in the 20's. Elda's courage, grace and attitude in facing personal setbacks is an inspiration.My book club unanimously raved about this book. I'd give this book more than 5 stars if I could."
2,"Safe, but not too bouncy","This is cute and very sturdy, but it was probably the most difficult thing I've ever put together. The directions were fairly clear, except for the one main part about attaching the springs. I'm still wondering if I did it correctly because the toy is quite stiff - it takes a lot of pressure to make Clifford bounce (I was hoping it would be really bouncy like the old spring horse I had as a kid). Also, the springs themselves are very thick and tight and don't give at all. My 20-month-old granddaughter is happy to sit on it for a few minutes, but can't get it to move much. I'm hoping that as she gets heavier and stronger, it will be more fun."
4,Lyrical Lauren Adams,"Lauren Adams once again shows us how to mix folk, country, and bluegrass into a ballad of simplicity. Beautiful in every aspect, the music flows with it's lyrics and hits you with a tempo not to be missed."
4,Lowell shows her mastery with flashes of brilliance,"A fan, and writer of poetry myself, I had never heard of Lowell before and found myself stunned by the first work I read of hers, ""Patterns."" This lead me to read quite a few other poems of hers in a number of her books, and the whole of ""Pictures of a Floating World."" Although there are many poems that are not very innovative or specifically charming, it is worth the read to discover her brilliance in so many of her poems. The imagist poetry movement of the early 1900's is often overlooked if one is not an extremely avid fan of it, but what a beautiful thing it is when Lowell writes at her best. Her poetry is straight forward, beautiful, loving, ""poetic""(ha, ha), tender and emotional, amusing at times, and it, not surprisingly, creates beautiful images in ones mind. Lowell's life is just as interesting as her poetry, and it should be looked in to as well, to gain a better understanding and appreciation for her poetry. Enjoy!"
2,Just Couldn't get into it,"I wanted SO much to like this book! I loved the fact that it was a romantic series - especially with historical influence - but by the time anything interesting happened, I just did not care anymore.I would recommend reading this from the beginning if you suffer from insomnia."
4,Scots Delight Voyager,"If you have any Scots blood running through your veins, you will enjoy this series of historical fiction. There is a good deal of steamy sex in the books (I could have done without-but I guess that is what makes it a romance novel...) I liked them because of the history and the mystery!!!"
2,down the chutehole,"I wouldn't buy it. I'm glad that I only bought the hardcover edition at barnes and nobles for 5 books. It was slow, dumb, and quit boring. The only good book in the series was Dragonfly in Amber. Here, in this book, it is slow and repetitive. Yawn."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"A Friend gave me this book to read and I thought, oh dear. The first few pages were really a struggle to get through, but I trusted my friend's judgement and so I read on. I'm pleased to say that I was not dissappointed with this book. In fact, I'm so hooked on Jamie and Claire that I must read Drums of Autumn and when I'm done with that, I'll definitely read the first two books that I missed. Bravo!"
4,Votager,"I really enjoyed all the books so far, for me it' s been like I don't want to put the book down. I want to keep going to see what happens next."
5,Intriguing,The whole series of the Outlander is very intriguing. You get caught up in the story and the characters. Yes some of it is a little over the top but that is what makes so enjoyable to read. Its is a long book that you don't want to end.
5,I'M ADDICTED TO THIS SERIES!,Now I can read on & Amazon got it to me just in time.. :) I'll definitely be purchasing the next book a few chapters before I finish this one so I won't have to wait to see what happens next!
3,What's wrong with a little entertainment?,"Was a fun read. Lots of characters and action.The romance part does not work for me neither does the ""eroticism"", i just jumped ahead,made the book a bit shorter.Hey, this is not litterature but well written anyway and since i am not versed in Scott-British history,was not bothered by factual innacuracies.Reading reviews about this serie was a Hoot. Especially a reviewer that goes as Cheap Scotsman who just loves to hate these books.Wow!! just go through his reviews of the first three books.Very plausible that this god fearing christian could submit himself to the punishment of reading these thousand pagers as some kind of mortification or atonement for some unspeakable sins.You can stop reading these books mr.scotsman, you have been redeemed."
5,wish it wouldn't end,Great adventure. Loved it. I wish there were more books following it. It should be made into a movie with the other two.
5,Love it!,"Great Book, I highly recommend it, but you should read all of the books from start to finish! They are all good in their own way!"
2,So sad....,"Outlander is my all-time favorite book. I am so sad that the subsequent books seem to get worse with each each edition. I will have to stop with this one, but I grieve that I will never get to read the great series this could have been."
3,"Good, but not her best","I have read all of the books in the Outlander series - as have all my friends - and I loved them. However, this was my least favorite in the series. I felt it didn't measure up to the standards of the others. I almost didn't continue with the series fearing the other books would be similar to Voyage and not the exceptional read Outlander was. Stick with it. Then you can get on to Dragonfly in Amber, which was excellant, and finally Drums of Autumn, which was my favorite in the series."
4,A Good (Not Great) Read,"I thought this book started slow, I would have preferred jumping right into the plot instead of so much backstory. There were quite a few things that were hard to suspend disbelief about. How many times can Jaime be injured? Does anyone realize how hard it was for a woman to get into medical school in the 1950's, especially since she has no formal education whatsoever? And what is with the homosexual hangup? It was OLD in the second book. Does the author think every gay man is out to get her husband? Lots of great action, though, still a very entertaining read."
3,Good but could be better,I had an early version of this from long ago and the first version was better. It was more plush and held my hand higher up so I was more comfortable. I'll rig something so this will be as good but you can always tell when they do a redesign to cheap out on the product and not improve it. I will give them points on the material used as it is more stain resistant but as it's a wrist rest that should be the first goal.
2,What you're looking for is not here,"If you are looking for the lovely piece from this film that is has a bell or chime-like quality to it in the beginning and is repeated throughout the piece It Is Not In The Soundtrack CD. A previous review helped me immensely with this as I had bought the ALBUM when it came out and was disappointed to find the music missing. IT CAN BE FOUND ON VANGELIS' OPERA SAUVAGE and is called L'enfant. Buy that one, this one is only good for background music for an Asian-themed dinner party."
5,"A Bit of a Sleeper, this is an A+ Romantic Thriller","Don't miss this movie! Linda Hunt's Academy Award winning performance, playing a male photographer, is just stunning. It's also fine early dramatic work of Mel Gibson - before his head got very large. Segourney Weaver gives a nuanced, intelligent and passionate performance...and it is lovely to see her in her absolutely beautiful younger years. This is a very compelling and completely entertaining movie about international politics, espionage, poverty and hunger under Sukarno in Indonesia, with an overlay of powerful character portrayals. It is also a great drama of friendship, commitment, personal sacrifice, professional priorities, international journalism, and love. The music by Vangelis is completely haunting, especially L'Enfant from Opera Sauvage. A wonderful film, equally enjoyed by men and women."
3,HUGE disappointment,"I waited so long to read this book. Bought it on the first day it was available. LOVED the first 2/3 of the book...and then it got so boring, it was as if I no longer cared what happened, just wanted it to be over. I expected more from Green. Definitely not her best work. HUGE disappointment."
2,"Jane, what's happened?","I am so sad that I didn't love this book. It felt very unpolished. I bought it last week along with a group of other novels, thinking I'd read Jane Green's book first and then get to the other books when I had time. Didn't happen. I put Jane down after a few chapters and moved on to the other titles, which I wound up liking better. It's a sad day when new, lesser known writers can top Jane Green. Out of curiousity, here are the other books I bought and liked better: The Next Big Thing by Johanna Edwards and Ice Princess by Liz Maverick."
4,One of the Better Green Novels...,"Personally, I think that this is one of Jane Green's better ""chick lit"" novels. The characters were interesting and while it wasn't completely enthralling, the book kept me rather entertained. Green has the great ability of coming up with inventive plots, instead of writing the same story over and over with different characters.Alice, the main character, is charming and readers can't help but root for her throughout the story. The other characters were also well-written and the story's ending isn't obvious from the beginning, like so many other novels. There were a few things in the novel that Green could have toyed with more to throw a few more plot twists into the story, but I believe that overall she did a nice job. Two thumbs up!"
4,"Good book, I liked Alice alot","Green did a great job of helping us connect with her character, Alice. I felt like I really knew her at the end of the book, and I enjoyed reading about her and her life. This book was fun to read, not only because it was amusing, but also because of the strong connections I had with the characters. I would definitelly recommend this book, as well as all Jane Green books!"
4,A different Jane Green,"I thought this was a little different from the other Jane Green Books I've read (Book Ends, which I liked, and Jemima J, which I didn't like as much). The multiple points of view worked really well to round out the story, but overall, there wasn't anything that really happened in the book. Everything is sort of even keel for 90% of the book, no major conflicts, just life bumping along, so I couldn't figure out why I liked this book so much - shouldn't it be boring? But it wasn't. For some reason, Green makes it work. I still wanted to read on even though Joe was predictable and Alice seems to live in her own world, never quite waking up to the reality around her. Still, they kept me turning the pages, and I think that bringing in the other characters, no matter how little their ""air time"" was, painted such a complete picture, I couldn't help but enjoy the story."
3,You either love it or hate it,"Totally minimalist real bluesy, garage rock. They epitomize the ""garage"" band. No bass, primitive drums, and two often poorly played electric guitars. Some songs I love and some songs I just plain don't like. But I don't think this band ever pretended to be anything it wasn't. And that says a lot to me. If you're into the White Stripes or bands like that check it out. Chances are you still may not like them. What you have to look at here is the sincerity and the spirit. Not the production or chops."
3,"Watch fine, strap flimsy","The strap doesn't last, and the loop that holds the strap in place breaks quickly, making the watch easily fall off. Where to get the loops? Or a new strap (they are very hard to identify with the correct watch)."
4,Lau Ching Wan rocks!,"This is Lau Ching Wan at his best. This film is another reason why he has proclaimed the acting crown of Chow Yun Fat once he left Hong Kong to do movies in the US. Many of Lau Ching Wan's movies have him characterized as the cool cop you would wanna hang with or the lovable hard-on-his-luck guy that girls can't help [but]feel something for. In the Longest Nite, he is just a pure bad-ass with a bald head. The taxi scene and his conversation in his holding cell with Tony Leung are worth the purchase of this movie alone! DO buy it!"
4,"Small, but very cute!","This product is great, just a little small. If it were bigger, I definitely would have given it 5 stars. As it was, I put it up in my office and received many comments on it."
4,Corelle Lifestyles Pewter Dishes--20 pc set,"I ordered the dishes and love the plates and bowls. They are light-weight and don't take up much room in my cabinet. They aren't gray or pewter colored, they're more of a tan to brown color. I like the pattern. I am, however, disappointed in the mugs. They are a great size and look beautiful but are very heavy--approximately 14 ounces each. I have other stoneware mugs about the same size that are much thinner and weigh a lot less, making it easier to hold and drink a full cup of coffee."
4,"Yes, it IS brown","If you're not aware it's more 'brown' than 'gray', you'll be disappointed. If you know and don't care, this is still a great set of Corelle dishes. As I've been using them and looking at them, the 'brown' seems to fit more of the beaten brass than a pure 'pewter', so that's been nice, too. Bottom line, if you can deal with your dishes not have gray tones, these are good."
1,I love it!,I actually loved this movie type thingy...........and......and.....i put one star to fool you so you wouldn't buy it so i could buy it over and over and over and over again...yea pretty much like that yo........YO MAN LIKE WOW..**** you ouch my toe
5,Cheryl St. John is a top notch writer,"Cheryl St. John is a top notch writer who fills the pages of her books with genuine characters in heartwrenching situations. She puts her readers right there inside the hearts and heads of her characters, making it impossible not to care what happens to them. The Mistaken Widow was a joy to read. Watching these two people fall in love, in spite of the odds against them, renewed my own faith in love and romance. Not an easy thing to do. Keep it up, Cheryl, and I'll keep on buying."
2,skillers vest,"Nice idea but needs some improvements. If your work involves bending over the top pockets are useless, everything falls out. That doesen't leave much room in the 4 remaining pockets for tools and nails etc. The stitching in one pocket has opened up in about 4 weeks and the hammer holder is weak. Doing siding work under a cornice above a roof required laying on the roof which crushed the hammer holder flat several times. It needs work!"
3,"One eerie collection of music, so much better than the movie","I've always liked Jean Auel's Ayla books, but found the movie to be awful- so little to do with the book. I can't honestly say I remember the soundtrack, it seems to me that much of the music must've been played at a very subdued volume, but most of the selections do seem to go well with what I remember of the story. The selections (I've only listened to the 30 second samples)tend to have a very eerie sound to them some have tribal elements mixed in. The music is definitely better than the movie, with what people are asking for used(usually)copies of the CD there ought to be a reissue that is more affordable!"
4,Oldie but Goodie,"This drama is a little cheesy and dated, but if you suspend your cynicism for a little while, the story itself is really well told. It's the traditional poor but happy orphan girl falling in love with a rock star story, but the characters are a little different. Choi JinShil's character is not the simpering MarySue that is the fatal flaw of a lot of these dramas. She has a fiery little temper and fights back quite a bit, it's amusing to see her get all wound up. Kang Min, played by Ahn Jae Wook, is suitably dreamy with rough edges. His music is gorgeous. It may take two or three episodes to get into it, but I don't think anyone would regret watching this classic, heart-wrenching tale."
2,Cheezy cover,"While I did not look at the inside of this book, it's illustrations, I was VERY disappointed with the flimsy, not-quite-hard cover, of this expensive book. I bought and gave it as a gift, but was embarrassed by the cover. In addition, it was ordered in early Dec. and took over three weeks to arrive---unlike all the other orders with Amazon done the same day, which arrived in under a week. It was too late to send the book back and be without a gift for my son."
1,I gave up,"One of the things that a Technothriller should have is some accuracy. This is where Tom Clancy shines above most authors. Tempest Down starts out with the hero being rescued by an air force flying dental squadron. The USAF has come up with some lame ideas, but a flying dental squadron is not one of them. When I got to the reference about vietcong prisoners being fed to piranhas (I guess they flew them in from the Amazon), I gave up. The premise of the book sounded interesting, I just couldn't get past the flying dentists"
5,great documentary,"very well presented. great information. in fact, this documentary was also motivational as well! some of the same people from food inc"
5,Inspiring,"In the 1980s I vaguely remember hearing about how small farms were being replaced by more efficient large farms. At the time I supposed it was progress. The documentary ""Fresh"" made it clear to me how mistaken I was. I was just a little kid in the 80s, so I have that as my excuse for not paying attention at the time. According to Ana Sofia Joanes, the documentary maker, we have no excuse now. It's all too obvious that government regulations and subsidies that support industrialized agriculture have created one of the greatest risks to our health. The doc focuses on interviews with farmers, many of whom tried to go along with federal government programs and who found the system seriously flawed and foolish. Joe Salatin is the best known farmer interviewed in this doc. He advocates a real common sense approach to farming that is also economically viable. ""Fresh"" is refreshing to watch."
4,Positive documentary,Great documentary. Ends on a positive note giving the viewer hope for reform in our food supply! I work recommend.
1,"Not what it seems, Beware!!","Beware!! This coin is looks good on the one side, but have you ever seen the other side? There is a good reason you only see the one side and that reason helps the seller, but deceives the buyer. Side 2 is horrible looking, I thought when I bought this product that the other side was going to look like the front, but it doesn't. Since my bad purchase I have found better card guards out there that have both sides finished and are much higher quality. Just do your shopping and you will be glad you did. There are some other websites that I have bought from that have a much superior product and better prices."
1,Abstract?????,I am an abstract painter and I had to return this book as soon as I received it. All it shows are patterns of some kind of designs. No color throughout the entire book.
3,More rice than pudding,"The flavor is good, but I prefer a rice pudding that gives you more custard. The results of this mix are more like bread pudding... quite dense and with very little custard. The box illustration is accurate, but would require considerable stirring to separate the densely-packed rice grains in the cooked pudding.If you prefer rice puddings to be mostly rice and less custard, this is the mix for you."
3,"Good player, bad manual and menus",I have not had any issues since instaling this DVD player. The picture and sound are very good. The manual and on-screen setup menus are very weak. I am very technical and had to wing my way to getting this thing to work. If you want to play MPEGS on this player you need to check the compatability.
2,Dibi dobi doo...,"This is my opinion about this CD BUT my negative critic goes to all other Jazz musicians.The CD is in general OK but it simply goes to my nerves when the pianist start ""singing the notes"" when he plays the piano! And this is a phenomena I have seen with some other Jazz musicians too. I mean if they are playing live it COULD BE acceptable to hear the musicians go LITTLE BIT ""dibidibidoo"" while playing, but do you really think people pay $14 to hear the pianist go dibi dibi dobodobo dabadaba OR to hear him/her play the damn paino?So I am quite disappointed and I hope the pianist reads this and leaves the ""singing"" out of the future albums!I give this 2 starts since there are also a few tracks where THANKS GOD I don't hear the dibi-dobi stuff but I must say every time I see this CD it makes me angry that musician can be so.... It's better I stop here!Bamo"
2,Shipping expensive,"Towel was a towel but read the print before ordering, I paid more for shipping than to purchase the towel."
5,One of the greatest all time records,"The Gories best record; a triumph of feeling, grit, reverberation and style.The record was famously recorded in a tin shack and has the raw feeling tha everyone triesto imitate but few can. Dan went on to do Dollrods while Mick formed the Dirtbombs, both groops are greatbut neither comes close to the true transcendent glory of this particular Gories record."
3,Quietly lacking vigor.,"Sautet's follow-up to his flawlessly ambiguous masterpiece ""A Heart in Winter,"" lacking as it does the latter's exquisite tautness, feels slack and in need of invigoration."
5,Lots of advice and easy to read. Love it!,"There are a lot of questions after graduation! It's nice to see that so many people feel the same way as I do. In this book, I can learn from their mistakes as well as from their good choices. The advice is totally varied (don't expect one expert opinion on what to do). It's also an easy read - you can start on page 120 or page 1. You don't have to read it in order since the advice is divided into sections; job, love, finance etC. Also, there are some good resources in here. Who knew that a discount on the Eurrail Pass is possible until the age of 26? (I thought it was over once you lost your student card) I'm glad I read this before my trip to Europe this summer!"
5,A Wonderful Distraction,"I won't totally recap the plot, others have done that all ready. I will sum it all up as a nice guy with a loser reputation gets a chance at the ultimate girlfriend. This has the effect of creating one of the most unusual, awkward, and sweetly enchanting couples I've seen in a long time.The story is sensibly thought out, given the subject, with all the very real complications one might expect. The animation is very sharp, and the voice casting is dead on. The end result is as good an animated show as I've seen in any genre. I recommend this one very highly."
2,Barely acceptable version of Maxwell's work,"I just finished reading this on my Kindle keyboard, and was a dissapointed with the product.Contrary to what other reviews say, there are no extras: no Einstein's comment or any others, and no preface either. This didn't bother me, since it wasn't why I bought it in the first place, but be warned.The edition did come edited for Kindle, with a dynamic Table of contents and barely any typos. However, equations are unreadable in most cases (a black box appears or something just as useless) and that is a deal breaker: no sense in reading a milestone work in Physics if the mathematical formulation is not present."
3,"Buy the paperback (5 stars), NOT the Kindle version (1 star)","Was initially delighted to see that this wonderful book is on Kindle, as my paperback version is falling apart. However, only the text has come out properly on the Kindle - the mathematical equations were not there - black rectangles where equations ought to be!!! Which makes the Kindle version USELESS."
4,Dodge Durango 2003?,"I checked this item on Auto parts Warehouse dot com, and according to the specs on that site this is an exact fit for my Dodge Durango, but on here it says it isn't! WASSUP WIDDAT?I will buy it here cheaper."
4,Xhol Caravan - 'Electrip' (Garden Of Delights),"I was forwarned by two individuals that this disc was quite repulsive.NOT the case at all.I was pleasantly surprised at how much I actually ended up liking it.Originally released in 1969,this band hails from Wiesbaden,Germany.""Electric Fun Fair"" starts off with a toilet flushing,but it develops into something creatively cosmic.""Pop Games"" is decent as ""All Green"" is a good free festival type tune.""Raise Up High"" has the band going completely insane.""Walla Mashalla"" reminds me a bit of Gong.The ensemble appears to combine elements of psychedelia,jazz,soul and kraut.What a style,eh?The 7' bonus track ""Planet Earth"" showcases the top notch keyboard playing by a member simply known as Ocki.One of the COOLEST album covers I've seen in sometime now."
3,"More of a ""look back"" at the series; not much new material","If you already own any of ""I Love Toy Trains"" Volumes 1-12, you probably don't need this unless you're a completist. It's like those TV shows that periodically have an episode strung together with scenes from older shows - this volume has a lot of recycled footage built around some new footage. For the price you're probably better off buying one of the other ""I Love Toy Trains"" DVD sets first."
4,"Excellent music, poor sound quality","As an 80s fan of The Right Stuff and North and South, it took me 17 years to find this album. The child in me loves the selection. It makes me feel nostalgic for these wonderful movies with their accompanying excellent scores. Unfortunately, the music has not been remastered and the music sounds distant and at times hissy."
2,"Not enought ""Right Stuff""","The Right Stuff is one of the finest movies ever made. The acting is first rate and the story is a very compelling one that focuses both on the original Mercury Astronauts and also the test pilot career of the legendary Chuck Yeager. But this representation of the film score is not very satisfying. It is more like an appetizer and you feel hungry for more soon after listening to the brief snipets presented on this album.The Right Stuff is a brilliant score if it could be presented in its original and uncut form. And all of it should be there too. From the Holst Planet's music to the Military hymns to Waltzing Matilda and of course the original compositions by Conti.If you buy this CD, don't expect it to satiate your appetite for the music of this fine film. Buy it only if you want a quick fix and hope and pray they release the rest of it soon!"
4,Right Stuff,"It was not a bad album, though it grows on you. I have seen the movie sometime ago but better live during the period of this wonderful time.I can imagine how the music fits into the movie. I was scored rather well."
3,"good book, movie was better","as with all of the Benchley books I've read this was fantastic! but as with all of the others, the movie was better than the book."
5,Gettin' on a jet plane,"This is the second-best rock and roll record ever created by human beings. The first, of course, is the Stooges' ""Fun House.""The day I bought this record, I got home a few minutes before I had to leave for work on the night shift. The Devil Dogs already were my favorite band going and I HAD to hear what it sounded like before I left. I put it on my turntable, listened to the first song, literally yelled ""Yes"" in a jubilant affirmation of my rock heroes, turned it off, called my boss and said I was going to be about an hour late. I listened to the whole album twice and forced myself to leave my apartment and my new favorite record. Eight years later, this record is still in my A-list rotation. There's no better post-punk band than the Devil Dogs and I highly doubt there ever will be."
4,One of Carpenter's finest scores,"This has to be one of the best scores in the Halloween series. It has a synthesized-type sound in the opening Michael Myers' theme that sounded better than the original (Halloween 1) piano track. The synthesized/electronically altered score throughout actually works well, especially track 5 ""Murder Montage"" which is a collection of several cues showing Myers' homicidal violence, including the hydrotherapy tub-scalding-murder. In his demented mission of murder, Michael Myers had some assistance from Carpenter & Howarth in creating a score that's as creepy as the movie it's written for."
5,"""Destroy Oh-Boy!"" rocks!","One of the greatest raging full-on rock records of the nineties, right up there with Zeke's ""Kicked in the Teeth"". Raw, raging, rocket-fuelled punk rock n' roll. Sounds like Bo Diddley, the Stooges, and the Saints played with the velocity of Motorhead. You won't listen to anything else for a week after getting it."
2,"Not bad, but not great.","Yes, Mayer is former SF, and it's apparent. Lots of fun going through the parade or Spec Ops equipment with him. And fun seeing into the mundane workings of an SF detachment. He knows that. And tells of it. But this story has too much set up. The story really did not grab me and get going until the last 200 pages."
2,Disappointed,I was overall disappointed in this book. First of all there were numerous typographical errors and the book was in need of a good proofreader. This is a big turnoff to any reader. There was a statement made that Lillith was a consort of God. Everything I have ever read about Lillith is that she supposedly was the first wife of Adam and I have read nothing about her being the consort of God. A lot of material was presented as fact with little or no suporting evidence. References to support statements were few and far between. I was looking for more fact than speculation on this subject.
4,#1 Scariest CD,"This is a very nice and scary cd. The best song on the cd is the main theme and is very scary too. It is very similar to the Exorcist(tubular bells)song but alot scarier. If you want the original soundtrack this is it. Dont get a cd with any new versions of the Halloween theme because the original is the best. Other songs that are good are Lauries theme, Myer's house, and the shape stalks."
4,The Complete Herb Book,The Complete Herb Book is a wonderful compendium for any gardener wishing to grow a broad range of herbs. Although the majority of these herbs are European and British I still found it to be an excellent book on the subject.
3,In simplified characters,"Please note that this is a bilingual edition, with ***simplified*** Chinese characters. Amazon does a poor job at identifying which Chinese script is used. They don't appear to be aware that many people read only one or the other. I hope you'll join me in complaining to them about this."
2,Giant Art Jar Kit is filled with fluff!,"We purchased the Giant Art Jar Kit and found that the jar is mostly filled with colorful paper confetti, so that it looks like you recieved a lot of craft items. When you open it, and rifle through, you will find that the actual craft items only require the bottom quarter of the jar. We were disappointed."
2,Made it thru 10 days of school,My daughter really likes the looks of this backpack however the t-handle is not holding up. After only 10 days of school use the t-handle has pulled out several times already so it's just a matter of time til it breaks completely. And they certainly are not overloading the backpack in the first few days of school. Too bad cuz the backpack itself is nice.
3,Better Than Many Reviews Indicate...,"I have read a number of books in this genre and I rate three of the most important ones in this order: Three stars to ""The Jennifer Project"", four stars to ""A Matter of risk"", and 4.5 stars to ""Blind Man's Bluff"". Blind Man's authors had the distinct advantage of researching and writing their book well after the cold war was over and people were more willing to talk. ""Spy Sub"" should receive an honorable mention since it deals somewhat with this mission but only if you have read at least one of the other three can you piece together what Spy's author is saying about the overall search. Conclusion: Read at least two if not all books mentioned and certainly read ""Blind Man's Bluff"" if you want a more complete picture. ""The Jennifer Project"" is definitely a good read and worth the effort to obtain it."
1,A nice bit of fiction,"I was very disappointed in this book. While many details are known to be true, there are equally many where the author has simply made up something, and presumed to be true if it was not denied. Not exactly the mark of great writing. The author would have been better off just sticking to the facts.He also makes basic mistakes such as claiming the DEW line (Distant Early Warning Line in Northern Canada) to be unmanned (I know two people personally who were part of the group who manned it, as I used to live in Inuvik, NWT, Canada). The new North Early Warning System is considered to be unmanned, and this was only completed in the late 80's, early 90's.There are much better books out there, such as 'Blind Man's Bluff' where the authors try scrupulously to present only the facts."
2,Not as riveting as I expected,"I had heard about this book some time ago while watching a documentary on television about sub warfare and the Cold War. Naturally, I kept this book in mind. I finally found it at a thrift store and paid $1 for it.I felt that the author skimmed over the entire matter and wrote about the fetching of the submarine at a ""high level"" - meaning not enough real meat and details to be that interesting. I think that some of the digressions about the CIA didn't really help. I also felt that the author did not go into too much detail about how Hughes was involved with the ship.Most of the book dealt with the recovery of the submarine. I would have preferred more technical details. But, at only about 170 pages, it is worth a read only if you find a deal like I did. In retrospect, I wouldn't pay full price for this book."
2,Not as technical as I had hoped,"OK, I'll admit it. I'm a geek...I wanted to know more of the technical details. This was roughly what you'd get from a long series of NY Times articles."
3,Great wobbler at the office,"I got this as a present for a friend as I noticed he had a couple of them on his desk (Cartman from south park and Allen from the hangover)I noticed that most one that people notice out of the three is HommerThe only difference between and the other two wobblers mentioned is that the other have trade mark phrases that they say when you move their head, however hommer doesn't say anything, his head just moves left and rightOverall it looks good however it is disappointing that there isn't a catch phrase when wobbling the head"
3,A 'pot boiler' but enjoyable nonetheless,"I enjoyed these letters only because I have to admire someone who can write letters as interesting and informative as this. Sadly though they are not on the same level as 'A Time of Gifts' or 'Between the Woods and the Water' in terms of historical content or romantic detachment. The book is simply a commentary of a trip Leigh Fermor and some friends of his made in the Andes, nothing of any consequence happens, except that Fermor paints a particularly lucid picture of the scenery and the people in the area. It's worth reading if you're planning to visit the Andes or if you've only got a few hours to spare but don't want to work you way through one of his longer books."
2,old-time adventures in the South American Andes,"Set in ""the good old days"" this book details the trials and triumphs of the writer's adventures in the Andes.The Book is a series of three letters Fermor wrote to his wife during his adventures.It provides a rgeat insight into the mountains, people and culture of the Andes - from descriptions of mountaineering adventures to colourful local markets.Sadly lacking in any real purpose (it's more a decsription of events rather than an adventure in itself) the book is nonetheless an interesting read."
2,Leaves and flowers not the fruit(berries),"Hawthorne leaves and flowers are used to treat heart ailments and not the berries. The berries have very little or no effect on any heart related illness. I am giving this product two stars not because Swanson is a bad company but rather wrong ingredients are used here. If they started selling a product made with Hawthorne leaves and flowers, then I'll be the first one to buy it. I hope this help."
5,OPERA IN NOVEL FORM,"I am a big opera fan and I also love adventurous, imaginative fiction. This book by Ms. Highwater manages to satisfy both of my loves. She has somehow managed to transfer the famous Wagnerian operas of the ""Ring"" from thr Rhine River to the Amazon River, and people his retelling of the Norse epic story of the ""Ring"" with Native American characters unlike any we have ever encountered in Euoropean literature. The strong role of women in this novel, the equally strong invocation of the powers of nature, and the beauty of the writing makes this one of my favorite novels! Brava Highwater!"
5,Circle of Thanks,This was the favorite book of our Down Syndrome daughter. She would bring it to me to read. It has a nice saddle theme to it. I enjoyed reading it to her.
5,Ideal,"This was the first DVD player I bought....and I have no complaints. I was immediately blown away by the video and sound quality improvements over the VCR.The only problem I had was related to the fact that my television did not have the neccesary line inputs to hook this bad boy up. I had to spend an extra $30 after the fact to get it to play certain videos without the copyright protection of my vcr distorting the visual.I would VERY much recommend this item. For the price and DVD quality over a VCR, you can't beat it."
4,Electronics Fan,"I recieved this DVD Player 3 weeks ago and think it is pretty cool! It is a great machine for the beginner to DVD technology. The price is hard to beat and the quality of the machine has been first rate. I played the Matrix, (A DVD that apparently freezes many players) without a problem. The remote is easy to use and self explanitory.The sound and picture are very clear and the DVD's load fairly quickly. The player also reads CDR/RW very well and plays audio CDs.A great value for the price, and I would recomend it to anyone who is looking for their first DVD player."
1,NO Optical Digital output!,"I have no opinion on the performance of this unit since I required the optical digital output to complete the installation of this unit to my receiver. (My receiver has one coaxial digital-audio input which is already occupied by the cable TV's signal but two unused optical digital-audio inputs). The specs for this unit promises an optical digital-audio output, but this DVD player has none."
3,Hmmmm,"Okay...So this really isn't what I thought It was going to be..I wanted to see maybe a WHOLE SONG live..but I guess thats just out of the question...Too much stupid talking from unknown people..It makes you wonder..Who the hell is this person and why are they being filmed?? Seems kind of unprofessional..Though don't get me wrong, some of the stories are mildly interesting, It just gets really boring REALLY fast... and get a better quality video camera..holy [...]."
3,Does not work as well as original charger,"I have used this charger for a few weeks now and noticed that the phone never gets a full charge with this charger as it does with the Nokia charger. Also, the charger came with 2 round tips, not with 4 tips as showed in the product advertisement image, probably because that image is outdated."
2,Don't Walk Away.....,"My daughter (3 1/2) likes the duck, but she really hasn't figured out how to get from one place to another on this. I find it difficult to navigate, myself. I had hoped that she'd gain some computer skills from this since she already knows her shapes, letters, how to count, etc, but no such luck. All in all, Jumpstart Toddlers isn't that great. And having to worry that the Jumpstart program will open up my Internet browser is pretty bizarre."
2,JUMPSTART TODDLERS WITH THE DUCK,"I was very disappointed in the software. Itis really boring.It should be more for a 3 1/2 to 5 year old.They should bring the JUMPSTART TODDLERS with the Dog, Peekaboo game back. Why change something that is already working?This game is a waste of money and cannot learn anything from it.The only thing that's nice is that it's colorful.I miss just buying the CD alone, now it comes in a cardboard box and it costs more money..."
1,Very disappointed,Jump Start Baby was fantastic so when my twins became toddlers I decided to buy Jump Start Toddlers. The graphics and sound quality are fine the but usability is not easy and very erratic. Take the counting game for example. 10 fish are displayed on the screen and it is supposed to count from one to ten so the child can learn to count. What happens is if the keyboard is clicked (which it is all the time) it goes on to the next group of fish to count. So basically your child is just hearing the number 1. This also happens with the colors. The flowers change color and as soon as the keyboard is clicked it goes on to the next color to change cutting Dee off in mid sentence. I think the product would be really good if this feature were fixed. We have stopped using this product.
3,US Marshal Carrie Stetko is Kate Beckinsale,Some interesting footage of Antarctica. The film seems to rush a bit. You don't get a feel for the charters. It was more like a TV drama then a motion picture. A throwback to the old cop dramas where we are told to ponder if a female cop can handle the work. Based upon a graphic novel/comic book as most movies seem to be of late this was an OK mystery.
3,A so so movie,I like Kate Beckinsale I mean who doesn't? but this movie struggled to keep me interested! I would say it is average at best!
4,WHITEOUT,THE OUTCOME WAS NOT TO EASY TO PREDICT AS IS SOME MYSTERIES. MANY OF THE SUSPECTS WERE ELIMINATED EARLY.
3,Well it does have Kate Beckinsale going for it...,"Not much here to see except Kate Beckinsale.I just won't pan a movie if she's in it, or it would get 1 star."
2,very lame,"I love movies, even cheesy, obvious, predictable action flicks! But this one was just bland, tasteless, lame! That's the best word to describe it - lame. Even my husband agreed, despite the completely gratuitous and weirdly long shower scene. They mumbled a lot, but honestly I couldn't have cared less about the parts I missed, it wouldn't have made it any better. Lame lines, lame fight scenes, could have been a decent plot but very poorly acted out. Sorry I wasted $3 on renting it. Oh, and most of the music didn't quite fit the scenes it was played during. Very strange, I have never seen that before in a movie."
2,huh?,"More is more, eh? Seriously, I'm very open-minded, but the constant circus-like atmosphere just got on my nerves. Kinda reminded me of ""Delicatessan"" which I also hated. My girlfriend glowingly recommended this film. I just couldn't get into it. I prefer Bresson."
5,Extremely long and extremely engrossing,"This movie is exhausting for those with short attention spans (such as mine) and it has subtitles to boot. I broke it into two parts and there were stretches when I stopped following the subtitles and just looked at the visuals.But this is a great movie. The sudden shifts in time, particularly the last third when we see the contemporary Baltic states, is extremely moving. There is so much to this movie. It reminds me of great literature from the 1950s that combined a sprawling view of history with humor and tragedy. It demands multiple viewings."
4,IMAGE!!!!!,"Very neat little Republic picture about witchcraft. Released by Image, the print used is not that great, but is quite acceptable. It looks mostly quite good, but there are a few rough spots although nothing is lost. The print used is a television re-release as evidenced by the replaced main title card."
4,Deviled Egg Cookbook,"How many different ways can you fix deviled eggs? Now, I know. Should be interesting to experiment with the various recipes."
2,eh,"So Po Kong's Mountain Demon Chi is the last one left (besides Shendu's own) and the Drum that was used to banish her has been reduced to chopsticks. This leads into a really awful fat joke episode.Tohru eats some rice with these cursed chopsticks (unknowingly) and gains her Chi. He had been trying to watch his diet, but of course, the chi of the Mountain Demon is going to just mess that up. Kinda sad that Tohru and Po Kong both became butts of the joke in this."
5,Recalls some great memories of when music was music,Sounds like a refreshing blend of meditative Leonard Cohen and sweet and lively Neil Young with the urgency of Bob Dylan. The singer's heart shows through all of it in a very refreshing way.
5,Wait 3-6 weeks for this one -- It's worth it!,"This is one of the best (albeit short) albums on the planet. It'll leave you wanting more -- so get Moonburn, too.Jon does a version of ""Big Chief"" that's better than any Professor Longhair version I've ever heard (and I've probably heard most of them).It's hard to pick a favorite, but ""Go Ahead Baby"", written by Cleary, is flawless. I don't think there's a girl anywhere who wouldn't love a guy who says ""Anything you want, you just let me know baby"". It's raunchy in such a charming way, with one of the best lyrics -- ""I'm just waiting for a girl like you. She likes to do what you think of, don't like to think what you do"".""Burnt Mouth Boogie"" -- You've never heard fingers fly so fast over a keyboard and sound so effortless.All I can say is thank God for CDs, because if this album were on vinyl, I'd be on my third or fourth one by now. You WON'T be selling this one to the second-hand CD shop."
5,A Great Guitarist playing some fun music.,"I found this gem on VHS about 15 years ago. I waited for it to come out on DVD and finally it did. This is not the Lee Ritenour of today, but the Lee when jazz was becoming his forte. This DVD is well done with excellent editing and the photography is crystal clear. For a 1984 recording, the sound is great and the songs are just pure fun. This is more fusion than pure jazz. If you're looking for more jazz oriented stuff then buy the Overtime DVD or the others with Dave Gruisin. I've enjoyed this concert for years and I believe you will also."
1,Tiffen 72mm 6-point star filter,"This is not what they have shown, it is a cheap Hoya filter. They lie about this item & it is a trap. They were going to push me for a Hoya instead of Tiffen filter. They are not honest people!"
3,Satisfactory,"' Great Gain and Frequency Boost.''''' I am giving this product 3 Stars because;As a discriminating listener, the sound reproduction quality was only satisfactory. The Bass and Mids sounded okay but the Treble being reproduced made my JBL Dome Tweets/Mids sound like cheap Peizo Tweeters. Does not compare to major brand Pre-Amplifiers. You get what you pay for.If you are not as picky about your sound as I`am this is a great little unit and I recommend it to you. It does exactly what it is supposed to do."
5,"Great CD, Sad news","For those of you who have not yet heard, I sadly pass along the news that Dan is suffering from advanced prostate cancer. His scheduled fall tour has been cancelled while he battles this disease. As a fan for over thirty years, I just want to take this opportunity to pass along my heartfelt prayers and good wishes to Dan and all those close to him during this difficult time. Don't lose heart. Now on to the good news. Full Circle is an excellent CD which, as others have mentioned, represents a return to the Fogelberg sound of the 70's and 80's. A must have for any fan of Dan's music."
4,Play it loud and be patient,"If you`ve never bougt a Dan Fogelberg cd before, don`t start here (buy ""Nether Lands"" & ""The Innocent Age"" first). If you have some of Dan`s most essential albums, though, don`t hesitate buying his new cd. It is his best release since either ""Windows And Walls"" or ""The Innocent Age"". It really grows on you. The song ""This Heart"" is so great - his most catchy in ages - and should be released as a single! I love this cd!"
5,dan fogelberg full circle,"As a HUGE fan of Dan Fogelberg, I knew it would be good. I wasn't disappointed."
3,Disappointment,"It's very hard as a Fogelberg fan to dismiss an album, and even more painful in the light of his recent passing, but still ... better be honest in Dans spirit. Full Circle is a disappointing album. Every song reminds you of an older (and better) attempt. Even the only inspiring track (the opening instrumental) is too short to fully capture the attention. This is definitely Dans weakest album. But let's not mourn: his masterworks are diamonds, and diamonds are for ever."
3,Good but Not Great,"This is a good but not great Fogelberg effort. Like all his music it is well crafted and shows that he is a very talented individual. However, most of the 5 star reviews seem grounded more in the fact that Fogelberg finally released new music.My hunch is that anything would please die hard Fogelberg fans.A few points to ponder:After almost 10 years since River of Souls ( a better album) the CD contains just over 40 minutes of music. Songs such as A Love Beyond Time, Fire and Ice, Nature of the Game, and the 1970's What in the World would have fit nicely. Perhaps they will be on the long awaited solo live album but I would have like to see more music after such a long wait.At times, Dans's fans seem more interested in his career than he does. Like most of us, as he has gotten older, the career seems less important.So - I enjoyed Full Circle - but try to look at it realistically.If it was relesed after the Innocent Age - what would you think?"
2,Disappointed...,Sorry guys..but I have to agree with John (way down the list): Just because Dan finally released a NEW album after 10 years does NOT make it worthy of 5 stars. I found this CD to be a bit monotonous and unfortunately flat. Each song sounded like the next and I found the words to be lacking in any sort of depth. Is this the same man who wrote songs like Nexus and Wild Places?? His emotional attachment and need to express his inner most thoughts and feelings (his strength in his past albums)seem to have disappeared. What's left is a bit shallow and lifeless. SORRY to be so hard on ya Dan but I've been a fan since the very early days and really expected just a BIT more. I certainly appreciate his talent and will always look forward to anything he does but I've passed this album on to a friend who may like it better than I will. It has not made my collection.
2,seams like fellows lowered their quality standards,"Just bought this item Nov08, its June09 and the seams popped. I've had the older style Fellowes gel pads for years (the ones without the microban) They where so old they where faded and worn... so I replaced them with these and the 1st one has already failed.I'm going to try one more and see if it lasts more than 8 months, hopefully they just had a bad manufacturing run or something...Oh, that chemical smell.. yes it is strong out of the blister pack, but it dissipates within a week."
3,"It's good, not perfect.","I bought this August 2007 and it lasted until March 2008, before the seams popped on me, and now it's leaking goo.I used it everyday at work, and even would transport it with me to other offices because I liked it so much, which could have led to the seams coming apart.Wish that it lasted longer than 8 months."
2,What is that smell?!!!!!,I love the comfort of this wrist rest but what is that chemical smell? It's making me ill at my desk. Can anyone answer that question???
5,Great Music for a Cool Movie,"The Man From Snowy River soundtrack is an awesome track of songs. I hoenstly would give it more than 5 stars if I could. Every song on this is a winner. I grew up with a family that loved this movie and the soundtrack is a major part of why the movie is great. I haven't seen the movie in years, but I recently listened to the soundtrack and literally pictured the scenes that went with it. The music just went great with all the action. Few tracks can accomplish what this has. I would highly recommend this to any fan of music."
1,Hercules Unchained,"My review is not about the movie, that would be a high 'camp' 5. The quality of the DVD is what gets my complaint. The studio that claims this has been ""remastered"" and has digital sound is selling a lie. BUYER BEWARE!"
5,Great Band,Brian Hansen and Kathrine Arthur and Legal Weapon band are very good . Brain on guitar is exceptional and Kat's singing and song writing ability are like no other .......
2,"i would to review the two books of ""Inb Battuta""","First one is "" A muslim Traveller of the 14th Century"", and other one is ""Ibn Battuta in Black Africa.""I also like to review his Biography and Islamic Empire."
4,No fishy smell.,"I purchased this item for my dog. Our vet recommended fish oil for his skin allergies. We've used it for several months and I believe it has helped him in conjunction with some other prescribed medicines.What I like about this product is that it does not have a fishy smell to it. The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the design of the bottle. It would be nice if the manufacturers of these products could design a bottle that prevented dripping of the oily product. Each time we use this we wipe the bottle top so it doesn't drip down the side and cause a big mess after time. More of an annoyance than anything else, but something to watch for when you use this."
3,Good product.,"I received this player for Christmas. I really like the fact that the media is removable and very portable - you can even use it as an emergency data storage. Sound is good and it plays all of my mp3s without problems. It looks good as well. 5 months later, I still really like it (but I could not make 3 stars go to 4 using Firefox?). Sound is still good, shuffle works, and the buttons are still nice. I keep it in my backpack pocket and it has many scratches, but it still works. I think they could have better interface and ability to organize playlists but... maybe I am asking too much for $35 player :)"
1,Minimal mp3 player,"This is the first MP3 player I have ever purchased; I do not believe my expectations were too high.Here are the pros:1)It is small2)It takes whatever SD card size you care to plug in3)It plays mp3 filesHere are the cons:1)You can not change the order of the mp3s on the player2)If you copy several mp3s to it, they may appear in any order.3)If you pause it, it will turn off in a short period of time4)It has no memory of where you last were in whatever you were playing once it turns off (especially annoying if you are listening to an audio book with large chapters)5)The battery life is not what I expected, less than 6 hours of play."
1,Better homeschool guides are out there.,"Having read numerous books on homeschooling ideas and techniques, I was not enthusiastic about this one. The concept of reading and discussing classic literature is not the problem with this book, rather it is Mr. DeMille's tone which is simplistic and vapid. At times it felt like one big advertisement for the college Mr. DeMille founded. Given the subject matter, I expected more substance and less fluff.If you are serious about a good education for your children and want to use classic literature there are far more excellent books on the market with the same theme, such as, ""The Well-Trained Mind,"" ""A Charlotte Mason Companion,"" and ""Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning."" These books are more inspiring, convicting and contain better examples than ""A TJ Education."""
3,"Be aware that even though it says format DVD, it is actually Blu-ray","When I purchased this for my son for Christmas, I was purchasing under the assumption it was a DVD. It clearly states under format that this is DVD not Blu-ray, and I didn't look at the case closely enough to note that it says it is Blu-ray. Thank goodness we do have a Blu-ray player in the house, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to view...other than that, it is a great deal. Just wish I had gone down and read reviews where it actually states these are blu-ray discs..."
3,Lucas Achieves What He Set Out To Do,"Finally, here it is! George Lucas has, with the Clone Wars series, achieved what he set out to do so many years ago: he's created a fantastical science fiction series for kids.I'm not begrudging him this. After all, Lucas has stated numerous times that *this* is what Star Wars is meant to be. I loved the original trilogy ... when I was a kid. As an adult, I see the flaws in each of the first three films. Especially ROTJ, whose Ewoks were so clearly family-centric.So good on Lucas for achieving this. My 5 y.o. loves this series, and I can see why: the iconic-looking clones, the lightsaber-weilding Jedi, the two-dimensional bad guys you love to hate, space battles, unusual aliens ... it's a child's playland full of colorful characters and just a little bit of complexity. As an adult, I don't enjoy it so much ... though I have to admit that some of the episodes are far more enjoyable than THE PHANTOM MENACE."
1,Great Animation...Lame Dialogue,"I do love me some Star Wars, well specifically the first trilogy (ep. 4,5,6) and the ""Knights of the Old Republic"" VG. The second trilogy(ep. 1,2,3) was awful...lots of flash and no substance. I was really hoping this Clone Wars series was going to make up for the turds Lucas put out with those last three movies, but I was sadly mistaken. The show looks great, but the characters are sooooo wooden. Who hires these writers? I understand it's a kids show, but there is no fun or joy to these characters. ""Avatar, the last airbender"" was a great kids cartoon...the characters in that series were dynamic and fun to watch, you actually care what happens to them.Also, i personally think every writer on this show should be fined $1000 every time they make one of the characters say ""I gotta bad feeling about this!"". Bleeech, my womprat could fart out better dialogue than this....and he's been dead for 15 years!"
4,"Star wars the clone wars, blu-ray",Star Wars: The Clone Wars (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]I received in couple day and packaged excellent condition and my kid liked to watch over and over. thank
5,Good first season!,"Beautiful animation! And if you haven't seen the episode ""Rookies"", you need to check it out. There are some great stories going on in this show. It's not just for kids."
4,great,"This was a good purchase, the only down fall was that it did not come with the pilot episode. I finally realized that the Clone Wars Movie was the pilot episode, just a longer version. Other that that is a great purchase :)"
5,Great Fun,"I'm 40 and my son is 5 and we really enjoy watching these episodes together. Excellent animation. Some of the stories are a little rushed trying to fit it all into 23 minutes but for the most part, they're really good."
5,The Best,"You know if you troll through the boards at [...] site, you'd probably come across all those lifeless fanboy clone war haters. Well let me tell you, this set is just phenomenon. You really get a very serious appreciation of how this series was made and the work and the effort that has gone into it. This cartoon series is a cut above the rest. This is not your regular 2-d cartoon and some of the stuff is failry new and pioneer. But this series has chock full of action, story and adventure. This set was just gorgeous and if this was just the first season, imagine season 2 and beyond."
3,A teens review,"This searies is great if you like children searies. I personaly do not like children movies or searies but this is oky. The action is great but the script makes the movie childrenish. I don't like this searies but if you like children movies, then you will love this searies."
3,Great series but it leaves you hanging,Great serries but one thing I really dislike is a cliff hanger. Thanks to who ever wrote the last script. They couldn't just say pick up and watch this movie to continue were you left off? Really that was to hard and difficult for the makers of the serries.
3,"If you've got nothing else to do, pick it up...",This book lets you experience the adventures of the Star Wars movies for yourself without a director's interference. That's the fun part about it--but don't expect some new revelations on characters you've known for 30 years.It's a fun read if you're yearning to see some familiar characters.
5,Excellent dog training advice,"Patricia wrote an excellent booklet on how to deal with this issue. There is no quick fix, drug fix or any other fix. It takes hard work and dedication to turn a dog around. We found that this worked well on our rescue dog who came with great anxiety. We worked through most of her problems in a month and are still working at it."
5,Another Home Run for McConnell,"This is very helpful for anyone who has or is considering getting one of the ""velcro"" dog breeds, anyone who has a dog and comes home to destruction, anyone who works all day but wants to get a dog...basically anyone who has or wants to get a dog!She starts out by telling you that not all behaviors add up to Separation Anxiety but that any dog can benefit from a little preventative training. I am working on teaching my little velcro buddy how to play by himself and that he doesn't need my attention 100% of the time to be okay.I would recommend anything written by McConnell because a) her books and pamphlets are clear and easy to read with lots of stories to help you visualize what she means and b) because I really like her approach to training your dog."
5,So you think your dog has SA?,"If you think your dog has SA (Seperation Anxiety) this is the book for you. My dog has SA, and this book was very helpful in recognizing the signs, and how to deal with them."
1,Not helpful unless your dog has separation anxiety,"I was looking for a book with advice on how to care for my dog while I'm working, but this was not helpful at all. It may be more useful for people who own dogs that have separation anxiety. I would recommend buy Happy Dog by Arden Moore instead."
2,No new information in this book,"I bought this book thinking I would learn some new information that could help with my dog's stress level. There was nothing new in the book that i hadn't already read on a web page. Not worth the money, even though it was only a few dollars."
4,Fast paced,"I have read this book twice. It is the perfect beach book - it does not require a deep philisophical committment - fast-paced story that while far-fetched kept me hooked until the very end. I read it before attempting to watch the ""Crying Game"" - I fell asleep during that movie but never while reading Goldsmith's book!"
4,Brewster Moore fell in love with Jahne after her surgery.,"This book was lots of fun to read, but one of the things that Goldsmith apparently wanted to show was that beauty isn't as important as people think it is. But she has Brewster Moore, the plastic surgeon who transformed plain Mary Jane Moran into beautiful, thin Jahne Moore, start falling in love with Mary Jane/Jahne **after** her surgery, not before. When Dr. Moore is thinking about how he could fall in love with Jahne, one of the positives about her that he mentions is that she is beautiful.Does this mean that even Goldsmith can't conceive of any halfway desirable man falling for a physically unattractive woman like Mary Jane was before her surgery, even with her great personality, sense of humor and all her other positive traits??"
4,best contemporary trash i've ever read,"I am usually a reader of murder mysteries and just happened to pick up this book. Without a double this is the best contemporary trash i have ever read. finished it in no time, laughing myself silly through the entire read. Several of my friends have recently become seriously ill and i have bought them copies of this book - they all report how it helped take their minds off of the illnesses. I have probably bought over 2 dozen copies of this book to give to family and friends. I hand it over with the words ""enjoy - it's a terrific ride!"". Thanks Olivia Goldsmith. This was the best book you've written so far - although Bookseller wasn't bad either."
5,Great deal.,I purchased this going out on a whim not quite knowing what I would get. But when I opened it up I found a very solid product for a great deal!
5,Works for MXL v67g with modification to Mount,"If you've read other reviews, you know this mount is good especially at its price point, but the main question is will this shockmount fit your mic?Took the risk and purchased his shock mount not knowing whether or not it would fit the MXL v67g. It does, but you need to pry off the round threaded piece on the mount with a flat head screw driver, then use the black threaded piece that came with the MXL v67g to mount the mic.Works great and better than the MXL shockmounts which use a spring like mechanism and friction to hold the mic up which I have and did not like because it seemed very insecure.This is not a fits all type of Shockmount, but wished it came with adjustable threading or adapters so that this mount could be used for any microphone with threading at the base."
5,Crocodile Dundee soundtrack is fun to listen to...,"Even though it is a very short soundtrack, it is a very fun soundtrack to hear. The track titled ""Crocodile"", really brings back the feeling of the crocodile attack scene."
5,BOOM,"Bought this for my brother for chirstmas last year, and he absoluty loves it!!!! Def recommend buying it and then becomming a rock god.."
2,Noisy Click Sound,"I use a remote clicker about once a week in a quite room. After I opened the box and tried to turn pages using the buttons on the remote, it made a noisy click sound every time when I clicked any button. This seems a good remote but it is useless to me. Not recommend to be used in a quite place."
3,Probably a good remote but too loud of a cliking noise,"I just receive the remote today and will unfortunately need to return it. While I liked its design and ease of use, I found the noise emitted when clicking many of the buttons too loud, which makes me wary of using it in fairly silent room. It might just be me being too cautious. However, I was used to my previous mouse which was totally silent and allowed for a smoother handling of slides, transitions and animations."
2,Laser pointer stopped working after 40 days,"After reading good review about the product, I ordered SP400 through amazon. Barely 40 days after I purchased the laser pointer stopped working. I contacted amazon and they have directed me to the manufacture. I'm awaiting manufacture's response. I bought this because I wanted a reliable operation, but I'm disappointed."
4,Good Product,This pointer met all my expectations. Easy to use and just works. The pouch that was included is also really handy.
5,Great presenter with amazing battery life.,"As an instructor I was looking for a good presenter/laser pointer. This is a great product. Works perfectly in every aspect: battery life if amazing, range is perfect, feels comfortable in hands, laser is bright. I had the Kensington K72353US Wireless Presenter Pro with Green Laser Pointer that was cool for the green laser, but the battery life was horrible. This unit is perfect. A definite worthwhile buy."
2,Not as good as I had hoped...,"I've had this product for less than 5 months and already I'm having problems with it. I've been using the remote with the same computer since I got it and, as of late, it will not communicate with the computer consistently. It's had this issue in the past, but usually unplugging it and plugging it back in would solve the problem. But now that is not the case. The light on the remote keeps flashing, but it will not advance slides in a PowerPoint presentation. I got this remote to replace a Targus that was accidentally broken by one of my students, and I can honestly say I miss that remote. The laser pointer on this one is pretty strong, but that hardly outweighs the communication issues I've had with the remote."
5,Well worth the price!,The SP400 Smart Pointer was extremely easy to set-up and use. It is comfortable to hold and works as described in literature.A very smart purchase.
3,Workable but not comfortable,"I bought this presenter to replace a Targus unit that failed after a few years use. I thought it would be nice to have something a little different than was available at the ""big box"" office supply stores. It works...but....(mine at least) has a few quirks. Once the USB unit is inserted in the laptop it seems to take a period of time (15 to 20 seconds is my estimate) to respond to the remote. This can be disconcerting with a group in the room. I'm not sure what the reason for this would be. My Targus was ""instant on"". Further the laser pointer has a habit of shutting off after not many seconds of use. Re-press the button and it comes right back on, but this too is distracting. Finally, as others have pointed out, it has an audible click sound on operation. I wouldn't buy this model again even though it does what it is supposed to do."
1,Junk - Broke in less than 2 minutes,I think the wiring on this thing is terrible. It worked for two minutes before it broke. I hit one of the buttons and then nothing happened. Only the laser pointer works now. Total junk.
3,Disappointing Mouse Function,"The mouse function only moves the cursor vertically or horizontally. The movement starts slow and gradually increases. Not the easiest to control.My previously owned TARGUS presenters mouse had a toggle switch that was more effective, and could move the cursor in any direction."
2,Low power laser,"For the size, cost and 2 battery power, I expected a more powerful and visible laser point. The range is good and the functionality is OK."
1,It stopped working within 16 months after limited use,"After 70 or so uses of about 1 hours each, this product stop working. As with another reviewer, I also found it to be sensitive. It would often advance two or three slides as a touch of the advance button."
5,Great gadget!,This wireless clicker works great! It is very easy to use and even comes with a laser. I love the red color as it matches my laptop!
1,Misleading,I ordered this item thinking that I would receive 10 since the item is listing says File Pockets...10 per box. I was astonished to find that I actually ordered 1 folder for $10.00!!!! Be careful to watch what you are purchasing.
1,sony wide lense,"I purchased this product while on a deployment in AZ, had it shipped to my Hotel, I had to leave before I could recieve my product so I had the Hotel staff return the product. This was in July I believe, and I have yet to see a refund... my first negative experience, while I know it was not directly Amazons fault, probably the shipping company or Comp USA's, but it was still my first negative experience...."
3,Not a bad collection,"This isn't a bad collection of poems, in fact there were quite a few that I liked. I recommend it."
4,Do what they are supposed to,They work like they are supposed to. It is a bit hard to snap in a piece from the ratchet set but it does hold well.I would buy them again.
4,good,This toy was a big hit with my 3 year old granddaughter. she has played with them nonstop since she recieved them
5,Nice......,"The quality is excellent and those are made in China. I am impressed. For few dollars you spend, you get a lot with this purchase."
3,Good General Duty Tool,"I have used this set a few times and it does good until you really torque it. I drove 6-6in. Ledgerlock bolts and I could not remove the 3/8 bit from my 18 volt lithium-ion impact driver. I don't know if it's the quality of the set or my impact driver, but I wont use the bits for any medium to heavy duty work in the future."
5,work well,"These work well,they are made well,and Ihave used them several times.I used thesein my battery operated drill,and they passedall my tests.Steve"
3,They work,"They work. They aren't the most snug fitting things in the world nor are they the best quality, but they work. I don't think they would hold up very long with an impact gun, but for the occasional use they are fine."
1,unknown brand accessory,"unknown brand attachment, the image quality are physical but something else, using them with the impact drill I have broken two of these pieces, whether they will buy this type of accessories that are name brand and Avoid discomfort"
3,Socket Drive Extension Bits,"At this time, I am not able to share a written review; the socket drive extension is a Christmas present for some one other than me. I will be able to share my opinion and update my rating when the individual receiving it uses the tool."
3,"Interesting movie - animal lovers, beware","This is an interesting movie about three Australian Aboriginal teenagers, from Arnhem Land, who are in trouble with the law. In an advanced capitalist society like Australia, their chances to succeed in life seems about nil. The movie is a kind of fantasy in which they become men by escaping civilization and fleeing to the wild, submerging themselves into the traditions of their culture and becoming hunters. This is great for them, but it's terrible for the local fauna, who gets a real beating from the boys (the scene where a huge turtle is killed by the teenagers leaves a particular bad taste). Of course, in real life, it's white people that have destroyed the environment around the world; aboriginal people tend to live in equilibrium with nature. Still, I found a bit troubling the equivalence of newly found self-respect with hunting."
3,Like the subject matter not the presenters,I love learning about the different crystals and what they represent. The presenters on the other hand were quite dull.
4,"What is ""The Didache""","OK I have to say I do not know what ""The Didache"" is.But my husband who is into Church/Christian history requested it. I would say it is quite a scholarly book---and now I can find out what ""The Didache"" is. :)"
3,"Good jack, but not designed for all autos","I bought this jack mainly to lift my cars and trucks very high so I could get under them more easily. The jack works great and lifts a lot of weight. You can use it to lift a variety of things, but it is not designed to lift all types of automobiles. Since the part of the jack on which the thing you're lifting rests (the lower-jaw shaped part) is only a few inches long, it can not get under the chassis of most automobiles. Even with a door opened, it really can't get underneath without risking scratching or otherwise damaging the auto. I don't know if there is a way around this, but I had to return this jack because it wasn't as useful to me as I had hoped. It is a great product for the type of work it is designed to do though."
3,Very Beefy but already rusting,"This is very well made but started rusting after 1 month, It looks great on my rack. The paint looks like the fail point."
5,60 inch Hi-Lift Jack,"I had an old one of these jacks walk off and I was so happy that they still made them, I bought two. These jacks are as nessesary as a hammer on a farm and I am glad to see that they are still built as well as they used to be. No, they probably wont jack up your junky import car without tearing the fascia off of it, but they will jack up a tractor or a barn or a fence post or anything substantial that needs lifting. These are tools for work, they aren't made to look pretty. Like any quality tool, they must be taken care of to remain reliable. You leave one of these outside standing up against a tree for a year and it probably won't work well. I called Hi-Lift at Bloomfield Indiana and verified that these jacks were still made in the good old United States Of America. I told them to keep up the good work and keep America working."
3,"works, but not perfect","I bought this because I thought my ipod would fit in it (and I wasn't sure what generation it was (at that time) and some reviews said theirs fit so I gave it a shot.) Well, I have a 4th generation ipod and it is too long for this sleeve. The ipod can go inside the plastic to protect and hold the ipod so you don't have to physically hold it, but you can't scroll or see what is playing through the plastic at the same time b/c the plastic screen is too small no matter how you put the ipod into the sleeve. If you have a 4th generation ipod, I would not purchase this."
2,Pay attention to dimensions,I am sure the product is just fine. I did't pay attention to the dimensions. I have an old school ipod Nano 1G and it does not fit in the least.
4,Good product,"I like using this for working out. I really like the belt clip feature. I agree that there is an alignment issue with the control wheel and the window, but I don't find it particularly bothersome."
4,i like it !,I like it! It is light wight and it fits my i pod Nano. The buttons and screen show well threw the window. The armband is very easy to adjust and it is comfortable However i do have to admit that it the open slip for the hold on the top is to little small and hard to do but it is doable. Another this that it goes clip to the armband so you got to clip it well. For the price I like it.
2,hmm,I was really happy to recieve this but for my Nano the holder doesn't seem to be long enough and the plastic is not sealing with my ipod at all. So if I want to adjust the volume I have to stop working out and take the Ipod out of the case and then re-insert it after I'm done. Not exactly what I wanted and I'd go for another brand.
2,Too small for iPod.,Bought this for my husband for Christmas. It's too small. You can't even see the entire dial on his iPod. Says its for 2nd generation iPod and even has a cardboard cut out of one. But it doesn't fit.
2,You'd better have children under age 10!,"While this book is well organized and has clear instructions for a wide variety of stitches, as a beginning knitter I am incredibly frustrated to find that almost all of the patterns - with the exception of a few difficult looking sweaters toward the end of the book - are designed to be worn by children up to age 10. So the whole premise of the book....increasing your skills as you move from beginning to more advanced projects.... does not seem to apply for anyone who either has no children, or whose children are older. Even the final chapter on designing your own sweaters says, ""In this workshop you will be shown how to compile a very basic pattern for a child's sweater."" This book should be called ""How to Knit for Your Child."" Get ""The Big Book of Knitting,"" instead!"
1,dont buy this,"its cute but it doesnt stick and the quality of the paper is poor. I spent time putting it up and it just kept falling down. it was very frusterating; i finally had to go and buy some wallpaper paste. havent used it yet, we shall see if it works..."
2,Cute but...,"The border itself is very cute and went really well with the blue and red paint we did on the walls. However, it does not stay stuck to the wall. We have a thin doubled sided tape on it right now and it's holding it for the most part but still have to smooth it down daily. We should have maybe tried border paste. Not sure if the two I got were just bad but I know from other reviews that other people also had problems with it not sticking to the wall. So loved the look of it but was overall disappointed with the product."
1,absolute garbage,"More drivel condensed in one book you would be hard pressed to find -- that is, unless you read any of the other trash rushed out by this one-man publishing outfit. Note: ""University Press"" has absolutely nothing to do with the highly reputable University of California Press."
2,Accepting Official Story,"Dear Readers:This is one of many books hot off the press shortly after 911 that just repeated the 'Official Story' spoon fed to the American public!A redeeming photo which will make this book worth buying and saving is on the back jacket. It plainly depicts the Military Guidance System attached to the right side of the belly of the plane, forever memorializing these precision attacks were done with the aid of high tech navigation gear, apparatus that I helped build back in the 80's with Government Contracts! Never in a nightmare did I imagine these `Pilot-less' capabilities would be used against our own people!Ashamed"
5,Prescient,"I read this book a while back, and although another reviewer calls it garbage, it's because he thought our intel agencies could do no wrong. Now, in hindsight, we know better. We see the chapter detailing the omissions by our intelligence agencies was Totally Correct. These authors were the First to reveal these truths, and this shows they are top notch investigators. They knew what the NY Times and Wash Post only published months and months later. Hopefully, their upcoming book, America Betrayed, will be even more prescient and revealing"
3,common desrves more credit along with a grammy on wednesday night,common was one of the best rappers of 2005 he surpassed the game in the middle of the year and slightly to almost outdid ludacris all the joints he submitted as a music video were good my favorite song of his is testify and go because they both have to excellent unique beats but go i like slightly better than testify because his lyrics was off the tops the corner was a very good hit as well when kanye is n the mix it usually slightly helps common songs sound better a bit but in testify there was no kanye and he proved to me that he can get the job do without kanye as he did in the passed he made one of the most underexposed rab/r and b songs of 2003 it was with the queen of r and b soul mary j. blige i like that song because it had a good heaven beat to it that never left my ear in the video it was so unique common was using cards with words and pictures to express his feelings to his death girlfriend while rapping now that is talent
4,Jumpin on the bandwagon,"Looks like everybody loves Common now, cuz they heard his song on MTV. Get a life and discover your own music. I've been listening to Common, since Resurrection. This CD is well done, but let's not put it ahead of Like Water For Chocolate or Resurrection. Just because you like Kanye West, doesn't mean you are a Hip-Hop head. Common is real Hip-Hop, with a real message. Stop watching MTV and discover what Hip-Hop is about, instead of jumping on every Kanye West or Jay-Z album. Use this CD as an intro to real MCs. True hip-hop in the purest form right here, the sound of the culture. ""Clench my fist tight, holdin' the right up."""
2,This is no Ressurection,"First off, I would like to say I own a copy of Ressurection by Common, and I think it is a great album. Saying that, this album was definately a dissappointment. This was not raw enough for Common, every song is a love song. Don't get me wrong, the whole fake gangster scene, is completely played out, but if wanted a R&B cd I would of bought one."
5,Best Damn Album of the Year Hand Down,"Commons BE album is simply a breath of a fresh air for the hip hop game. this is what hip hop is all about. Be speacks to the soul. now that common got kanye to produce most of his tracks he has a album that is just fire. i could and do listen to this album every single day. my presonal favorite tracks have to be Be, The Corner, Faithful, Chi City, and the The Food."
4,Oohh!!!!!! What can I say!!!!,"Well, this album is a classic especially the way hip hop is going. I miss the true essence of hip hop. Well I guess that is a sign I am getting old school. But damn I am only 24 yrs old. Anyway, this masterpiece Kanye and Common put together is incredible. The only reason why I give it 4 stars because I wish the album had more than 11 tracks. The dvd is ok and for fans who do not know Common as a person should look at the bonus DVD. Songs like "" It's Your World"" produce by Jay Dilla (Big Ups Jay Dee love your work) is wonderful. The song just bring life into your soul. Just get the album and you will know what I am talking about. One."
1,Don't buy it,"I placed my order (and paid for the full subscription) in July. It is now mid December and I never received any magazines. I wrote Amazon, but they said I have to write the Magazine Express folks <customerservice@magazine-subscriptions-amazon.com. After three emails to Magazine Express I finally got a response saying they would cancel my order and refund my $22.95 in one or two billing cycles (months) on my credit card. They said they'd send me a confirmation email in a week. It's been two more weeks, and I received no confirmation, and no refund. You'd be better off buying the magazine straight from the Equine Wellness site. It's been 6 months these folks have had my money, and I am still fighting to get it back. By the way, Magazine Express never apologized for the mistake - makes me wonder."
5,i like android lust's last ones but ...,... i need someone to upload this to kazaa so i can check it out!
3,MSCE review,"Ok guys.....Let me begin by saying. I am working on my MSCA, and just purchased a simliar book. I have read all of the reviews on all of the MSCA or MSCE preparation books and have yet to read a good one. It seems that no one has written anything to help you pass the MSCE OR MSCA...but somehow people seem pass these exams?I just recently just pass my A+ exam. Neither Jean Andrews or Mike Myers ( after reading them both) gave me actual preparation for either the hardware or software test... but still passed the A+ .Before going and forming a conclusion based on what someone else thinks. Think about this... Bottom line is people want to be spoon feed the information, and go pass a test. IF that were the case, the test would be easy, and then everyone would be certified. Then the being MSCA or MSCE would be useless and crap."
1,"Bad, bad and bad",If it would be possible then I would give this book a 'no star' rate.The reason why I am so hard with my judgment is that the book does not cover the topics deep enough so you will pass the exam. Some of the topics are even completely missing like for example VBScript. The topic Terminal Services is completed with 20 pages which way to less.If you rely on this book and you will go to the exam you will experience a huge surprise what questions are waiting for you. With this book there is no chance in my opinion that that you pass the exam the first time.Another reason why I gave this book one star is that it is from the manufacturer of the software itself and it is more than a shame that Microsoft published such a book.My recommendation is ... don't waste you time with this book ....look some where else. I put this book away and bought one from Syngess and I passed the exam at the first attempt and believe me it was not because I read this book first.
2,disappointment,"I've yet to find this book to be any help. It makes it sound simple and easy but there are a lot of easy examples and a lot of filler. I've done the real test twice, making worse the second time even after buying Measure-Up practice tests and re reading the books I have. Microsoft makes the test even harder the second time and have the nerve to claim that they don't. The manager at the testing center admitted that they do but he doesn't know why.I'm beginning to understand why a lot of people don't really like Microsoft.I'm disappointed in much of the so called training material that is being offered for this test and am beginning to think that it's all a big plot to relieve poor slobs of their money, me included.Read and use this book at your own risk."
3,sugar free licorice,"it was a great produce, the only problem that i had with it was that i did not think that it had any calories in it but it did,"
3,Cute,"My 22 month old daughter likes this book, but it is not the first one she pulls off the shelf at reading time. The illustrations are beautiful though, and the pull out ""map"" is fun and interesting for children."
1,"These are NOT the songs from ""susan"" movie!!",I have watched this show at least 15 times so I know the tunes by heart. The songs listed on this page are NOT the songs from the movie Desp. seeking susan.Can someone get these changed????I did go to freeMP3.com and heard the same tittled tracks and THOSE ONES are the real deal. I LOVE the tunes from this movie!!
3,Not Bad,"For an insturmental album, it's not bad.It's too bad that none of the other songs from the movie like ""Into the Groove"" are on the album. Why are we stuck with the ""Making Mr. Right"" soundtrack? They have should have included the other songs instead. How about the song that is playing in the background when Rossana and Aidian are in the diner ordering blueberry pancakes? They dropped the ball on this one. I still like it though. The best part is the theme Madonna struts to whenever she is on screen. I'm not sure the name of that song, but you'll be able to pick it out and say, ""Oh yeah, that's Madonna strutting down the street."" And may I add, Rosanna Arquette and Aidian Quinn rule! Madonna's pretty good too. If you are a big fan of any of these people, get it. Otherwise, save your pennies. Take care."
2,Grat Book,This book is written really well. All info is understandable and written to where any one can understand it on a first read.
1,Didn't work,"The multifunction ""joystick"" central button was faulty. Sometimes I could get it to change the volume setting, but its play function never once worked, no matter what I tried. After consulting with Lexar's customer service, I returned the unit.Many owners of MP3 players have complained that their units would freeze and they had to take the battery out to get them to work again. I had to do the same thing several times with this unit.This was my first purchase of a portable MP3 player. I was attracted to the Lexar because I liked the idea of using removable SD cards. However, now that I've seen firsthand how flimsily these things are constructed, plus having read many folks' complaints regarding how easily they break, and considering how expensive they are, I've decided to give up on buying a portable MP3 player."
4,Must have accessory for your digital camera,You will be amazed to see the difference in clarity between a photo shot without a tripod and with a tripod. A tripod is a must. This cute little tripod from Sony makes the job easier to carry it around along with your camera. I gave it a 4 star because sometimes the tripod is not able to hold the weight of the camera and tends to fall. I have a Sony DSC-P200 camera which is very light-weight. This tripod is not able to hold the weight of such a light camera. You can't use it for your heavier cameras or camcorders...
3,Hooked on Classics,"It's ok, too much of the first one in it. I was hoping for something different, maybe a little newer. Not the same thing over and over."
3,classics in a new light,"I had always liked this album, from way back when it was on a casette. As nobody these days has a casette player, I wanted to find out if the album was now on a CD.Luckily Amazon had it! Now I enjoy listening to my favorite album..."
5,Stunning operatic performance and composition,I heard a review of this opera on NPR and was hooked. I bought it completely on a whim. I'm thrilled with what I got. Golijov blends several different musical tradtions to create stunning new music. Hwang's libretto beautfully illustrates the characters' passion. The opera is about an actress who worked with Spanish playwright Federico Lorca before his death at the hands of the facsist party. The opera illustrates how she made peace with her actions since his death. A beautiful story that will hopefully remind us how important freedoms of pen and speech really are.
1,Ainadamar disc,Disc was imperfect. It stuck in several places. very inferior.You should not send such damaged discs to people when they order them.
1,Not a complete add-on kit,"I had purchased the basic set of Tarifold Display Pockets and wanted another set of the pockets to expand the whole system. What I received didn't include a mounting bracket for the sleeves, however, and as a result I returned the add-on pockets since there's no way to attach them without the mount."
1,Not at all what I expected,"Junque music. Sorry I bought it. There are two songs off of the Raising Arizona tracks that I do like, however... I'm really not happy with this one at all. Maybe I can go up to a pawn shop and trade it for something listenable. Sorry Carter."
1,ITEM DESCRIBED WAS NOT THE ITEM RECEIVED!!!!,"Just as the previous reviewer said, I too ordered this organizer (for my son) and instead I received a pink and white organizer. This will NOT work for a boy. Nowhere in this listing does it say 'pink'. It doesn't even give you an option to choose a color. Disappointed..."
1,ds lite organizer,This was very misleading because they show a picture of a black one and no where on the order does it state that the color can very. I ordered what I thought was 2 black organizers for my twin boys and got 1 black and 1 pink I wrote to complain and they assured me they would send me another black one and then I could return the pink one. When I received the second shipment it also contained a pink one. So since I didn't have time to keep getting and returning packages I had to return all three of them and now I have to go to the store to get them.
5,DS Lite owners ~ MUST HAVE !!!!!!,I purchased 3 of these cases for my kids. One pink and two gray/black/white ones. These are super! My kids haven't lost or misplaced a game since. This is the best case and organizer. There is a place for everything.
1,Talk about painting a turd Yellow,"I am a DeWalt fan and may well own %50 of their product line, but I won't own this. If you want the same thing buy the $69 grinder and a can of yellow paint (Frequently bought together)and you will have the same quality of tool.I set it on the work bench plugged it in and turned it on, and Immediately the entire work bench began to vibrate. My Dewalt 20 volt charger with battery in it nearly walked off the bench along with other things.Even Walmart laughs at this thing, talk about cheap Chinese junk with an explanation point!!I returned it and bought the Metabo, it may be twice as much in cost, but it will grid anything to precision, unlike the DeWalt which with unbalanced wheels will only be good for lawn mower blades."
2,Grinder review,One of the wheels wobbled. Bad QA. I returned it. Amazon's return policy is excellent.
5,Superb Balance,"Out of the box, it was perfect, takes a little time to stop, so I would not walk away and leave small children near it, but shop safety is always a must. The balance is fantastic, a great tool for the money."
5,Perfect Gift,Reading many product reviews convinced me to buy this Bench Grinder.It was exactly what my husband wanted in a gift and I was happy to find it for such a good price and it arrived in time for Christmas.
5,Great Product,Works great has plenty of power well built.I bought a wire wheel to use with it.recommend it to anyone needing a larger grinder.
2,DW758,I have numerous Dewalt products and they are all very good. This bench grinder is very good after I completely took it apart and installed the missing and damaged parts. The parts were sent to me by Dewalt. The unit appeared to have been assembled by a kid.
2,RCB Design - Roy's Shop,"I'm very disappointed in the grinder, it vibrates quite a bit due to the out of round, balance,and wobble of the wheels."
5,Real Numbers = Real World Applications,Real Numbers touched on everything that we are learning in lean accounting training. An excellent resource toback up the training as it gives real world examples of lean accounting applied in two companies that have truly embraced lean: Lantech and Wiremold are both featured.Todd KunzeDivision Lean Manager for O-RingParker Hannifin Corporation
1,not what i expected,the sound level on the first side of the cassette goes up an down and was not easily heard in my car. I have not had time to listen to it at home.
3,world industries skate board,"very happy with the service and skate board, just one bad thing the grip tape on top of the deck is coming off like a sheet of wall paper. looks like it was pulled too tight when first put on. i am contacting the manufacturer."
2,Disappointing,This is a solid but rather introductory book on sales and persuasion. It is disappointing because for this high price you expect at least textbook quality. Or a revolutionary new approach.
4,"Good quality, but raising prices???",Good basic tape. Came back a year later to buy more and the price has gone up like 20% since then. Seems like older technology shouldn't go up in price so much--I don't know.
2,Soft-core java for weekend programmers,"Don't believe the cover. This book is not useful for professional programmers. I hadn't really used Java since JDK 1.02, and thought this book could get me up to speed. Now it just collects dust and occassionally gets further defaced when I'm feeling spiteful.It probably would be good for somebody learning Java from Visual Basic -- it includes lots of VB-specific notes. But if you already know anything about Java or OO you will find this book very slow and hard to use. It makes a terrible reference as its description of both the language and the libraries are far from complete, hoping that you can infer the general ideas from their simple over-explained examples. Serious programmers will be bored or even insulted by the windy, condescending prose.Keep looking. There's got to be better out there. I wish I had."
3,OK - liked others more,"I got this book, and the ""Just Java 1.2"" book. I learned more from ""Just Java"" and liked it more. Core Java jumps all over the place and the layout is hard to read. Little Swing info."
2,"if you are new to java,don't buy this book!","This book is very poorly organized. After 70 pages,it even didn't tell you how to input data. It just gave you some examples but gave very little explanation. if you are new to java,you are going to ask,""what the hell is the author trying to tell me?"""
1,"sadly, a complete waste of time","I bought this book - both vols - and wasted 3 months reading Vol 1.If you really want to learn Java, buy a good Java 2 Programmer Certification book (eg. Mughal and Rasmussen is excellent) and write the exam. That is all you need.This book has backing from all those that matter - Sun Press, and all these rave reviews - so it does not matter if I tell you the sad truth; ""Skip This Book"". There is too much fluff and the book does not really teach you the nitty gritty and important details of the language. This book served a purpose when there were no other books, but not today when there are some great books.Why do authors and publishers think that they have to produce a 735 page tome just to cover ""Java Fundamentals""???Spend your money elsewhere. The money you spend is not really so important as the time you waste reading it and yet not gaining mastery over Java."
3,A mixed [and small] Bag,"This CD is truly a mixed bag. It is a re-release of a ""Somerset Stereo"" 99 cent bin record of the early 60's... I know, I grew up with the vinyl! There is some interesting and sometimes ""muscular"" playing that has something going for it, and the music is treated purely on its own, thus played often slower than the soundtrack, and sometimes actually differing greatly from the soundtrack. The playing is good, but not great, the chorus is very ""wobbly"" in their vibrato and tone, and the engineering: above-average 60's analog stereo, but far short of Mercury Living Presence or RCA's Living Stereo. If you're a fan of epic soundtracks, this could be an interesting addition to your collection, but I do question why a $.99 bargain LP from 1962 with less then 45 minutes of music should now cost $17??? With superb alternatives now available from Kunzel on Telarc and others, this is definitely a ""curiousity"" rather than a must have."
5,Outstanding!,"I was searching for music to King of Kings and stumbled upon this. It is an outstanding CD. I would recommend it highly. Beautiful choral music, organ to make you weep and such majesty to the numbers! GET IT!"
3,"Real masterpieces, but poor performances",All music here great. But the performances are very poor. Recorded sound is fine nonetheless.
3,they work fine for me,"I got my camera (Sony V-1) about 3 years ago. I have two of these batteries, one that came with the camera and one I bought later. They both still work fine for me. I dont use this camera daily, but when I go on trips I take enough pictures that I usually drain at least one of the batteries totally each day.My complaint is that they are too expensive. I tried a cheaper no-name replacement battery, but something was wrong with the contacts and I had to send it back. I have used batteries from that company for my camcorder and they worked fine.I think the whole ""info-lithum"" thing is stupid. The camera is supposed to show how many minutes the battery has left. It is totally inaccurate and pointless. But that is just as much the cameras fault as it is the battery. It is just one of Sonys gimmicks."
4,Power in the Hands of the Trio,"Recorded in 1987 and released a year later, TD captures the qualities of this horror movie in the soundscapes, which is paced by a shorter track (3:20), Caleb's Blues.Edgar Froese, Christopher Franke and Paul Haslinger deliver nearly 47 minutes of power, that is strongly developed in the longer works - Bus Station (including Mae's Theme), 8:42, She's My Sister (Resurrection I), 7:22 - and a pair of numbers flow together at one tick over nine minutes, Fight at Dawn and Mae's Transformation.The 1980s was an incredibly hectic time for TD - considering the number of side projects - and this is one of the underrated efforts."
3,Word fun,"I found the book full of interesting information, and a place to start, but not always complete or definitive.For example, in the entry for ""gaffer"", at the end of the entry is says ""A gaffer is also the chief lighting technician on a movie or TV set,"" That is great as a definition, but it gives us absolutely no information as to why the word came to be used, the etymology of the the word in this context.In other words, it doesn't live up to its title all the time.Overall, though, I do enjoy the book, as I am a word junkie. (A map junkie too, but that doesn't apply to this book,)"
1,Reviewers are Correct Doesn't Work,"I tried this to power a modem and router. When the power is removed the unit shuts off within 15 seconds. I tested the battery and it will put out 9+ amps so the battery is not the issue. I feel this is poorly designed and doesn't work as a UPS should. I am not using ANY USB software so that's not the issue. When it does kick on, the line voltage drops to under 90VAC and remains at 100VAC.This would explain why devices connected to it shut down.I am thinking of removing the battery and throwing the rest of this away in the junk where it belongs. Shame on you energizer for putting product out like this."
2,One star for each of the songs worth listening to on this album,"Songs ""Oh Yeah!"" & ""Still Fly"" are definitely the stand-outs having both been in heavy rotation on MTV back in 2002 when they first came out.A bit confused as to why they allowed an Atlanta Dj (Greg Street) to do a few skits and then name them all after him... ""Greg Street Countdown,"" ""Greg Street Stuntin,"" ""Greg Street Radio."" Who's cd is this anyway? The Dj's name is on it more than the artists themselves.Other than the two singles mentioned earlier, the remainder of this cd is filler."
3,Hood Rich,"This was a very different approach from the Big Tymers on this album. They gave us a different style of rap on this album that was very odd but refreshing at the same time. But at the same time they kinda disappointed me. Don't get me wrong this is a decent CD, if you like the Big Tymers then i suggest that you pick up this album but don't expect the same type of music that they have been giving us for years.The reason I give this album 3 stars is only because its not as good as any of their other CDs. This was their worst but its still not that bad. Big Tymers fans..... go pick this up, If you werent a fan before this album, I think you should pick it up and see how you like their new style."
2,Big Tymers moving in wrong direction,"Im a 21 year old college student and the first rap cd I ever bought was the Big Tymers ""I got that work"". The lyrics and beats were great. I've listend to Hood Rich a couple times through and I must say that I am extremely disapointed with the Big Tymers latest effort. These guys are not singers, they are rappes, and in Hood Rich their songs are far too melodic. I liked ""I got that work"" because of the bling bling lyrics, tight beats, and bumpin bass. It was fun to drive around with my friends pretending to be Big Tymers and hollering at chicks and throwing pennies out the window. You can't do that with ""Hood Rich"", some songs are borderline R&Bish, especially the choruses. Still Fly, Big, and Sunny Day are good songs. Some tracks are worthless to the album (slick talkin, pretty pimp). I wouldn't recomend purchasing this album."
3,"They fell off Big Tyme, but it was awight.","They fell off big tyme with this album. If the Hot Boy$ & Mack 10 was on here, it will be *****stars, since they ain't on here, they messed up! I like some of the new people like:Mikkey, Christina she shoulda been on here, she can't spit on the mic, I also like Lac & Stone. But this album was awight, but not better than none of other albums in Cash Money. If Cash Money keep making joints like this, they gone end up like No Limit. Cash Money still is fly, and my favorite record label. I hope everybody still together, and go back to their old hot boy style."
1,This a Blatant Rip Off of the Ipevo USB Phone,"I got a little confused and ordered this phone thinking it was a mislabeled IPEVO Free-1 UCB Skype Phone. It looks like the real thing, same dimensions, even comes in a faked Skype box, but it ain't real. It is a cheap Chinese reproduction of the phone. Good news is it still works, but the buttons on my phone don't work. This was an unfortunate $17 mistake. I wish I hadn't bought it.[...]"
4,Sony Flash HVLF32x,The product is what I expected and the release of the merchandise was excellent I have no type of complaint ... thanks
2,Still don't get it............,"The only thing that I consider poor design is the battery compartment lid which is constantly opening. Think a better design could have been incorporated so that this would not happen. Even a screw that locked the lid could have been much better, but then again you have the cost of a small screw that would affect the bottom line.Other than that, it was in the 4 star area............."
4,"Good grinder, but they stopped thinking a little too soon","I just got this unit from Amazon (a GREAT store)and put it together. I am very pleased with the smoothness of operation (inifinetly better than my old Craftsman grinder), but less than pleased with the not very well thought out scheme for attaching the plastic vision safety guards and and the aluminum pedestals for supporting the piece you are grinding. The former attach to steel brackets that can easily come in contact with the grinding wheels (not good) and the latter are only supported on one side and as such can tilt when you apply pressure to a piece being ground (not good, either).The instructions are also quite poor in showing how to assemble the accesories. It reads like it was written by someone for whom English is a second language.Also, wish it had a brake as the grinding wheels spin a LONG time after you power off.Overall, a good tool, but one whose designers stopped thinking too soon when designing it."
4,Dealt bench grinder,I bought this for my hubby and he was thrilled. He uses it to sharpen all sorts of things! He is very satisfied with the product. Recommended indeed.
2,Strong Grinder With Bad Wobble,"The grinder seemed to be built strongly. After mounting to my bench and turning on, the grinder had a terrible vibration, enough to make tools vibrate off my work bench. After looking closely, I found that the course wheel was close to an 1/8"" out of balance. When I tried to remove the wheel, I found that it was impossible to remove the wheel cover with first unbolting the grinder from my bench due to it having 2 screws that go in from the bottom. I decided to return it and look for a better, more user friendly alternative.Pros: Seems like a very strong unit. Good tool rests.Cons: Very bad wheel wobble. Unnecessarily hard to remove/replace the wheels due to the design of the wheel covers."
5,Took Me Off the Rez but Cant take the Rez Outta Me,"This Is a GREAT Movie Written by Greg Sarris who is a local Santa Rosa Native,This film was Filmed in Santa Rosa and used many Sonoma County residents as extras{Myself and my Mother included}This brings todays Native Americans into the reality of life off the Rez and those who try to keep their traditions alive in a white world"

4,Classic garage-punk compilation,"It's a good compilation of garage-punk bands from USA.If you like Pebbles or Nuggets, it's good for you !Recommended !"
2,Horner's Best Racket,"It is one Horner's best put-together performances with elegant LSO playing. The much-fetishized score itself is the usual collection of rewrites of familiar repertoire, from Goldsmith's original 1979 progenitor score to Kachaturian and Leonard Bernstein. It all mostly is effective in the flic but resonates more as a lot of orchestral effects-- crash-clang-trill-- simplifying and making literal the qualities which the original film and score left mysterious and threatening."
2,I thought it would work on my camera,The product was fine but would not work with the camera. The connection for the camera was not for my camera. I returned the product and resceived credit. Thank you.
4,Works as advertised,We were given the camera for free but there was no charging cord. This one is just like the original. Works well. No issues and the price listed here is unbeatable.
1,Not Genuine Sony!,"I ordered this item because it is listed as Sony brand - I received some ""Wasabi Power"" brick from china, which is generic. I refuse to connect this non-OEM adapter to my $600 Sony Camera. I have asked for a return / refund."
3,This book is good and Only good (sorry george),I found this book hard to follow and the sample code was to big to learn from. If you are looking to learn JDBC programming you will learn a small amount from this one !
3,Not what I expected,"I am not new to database programming, but I am new to JAVA. I was looking for concise code examples of how to accomplish inserts, deletes, and updates using JDBC and JAVA. I am one of those individuals that learn best from examples. Updates are covered in the example code, but the non-trivial items of inserts and deletes are not. The book is more about three tier client/server and RMI than it is about fully useful database programming using JDBC and JAVA."
4,vital viewing for all Americans,"If you have watched several documentaries on the war of Iraq such as ""Hidden Wars of Desert Storm"", and ""Uncovered: The War on Iraq"", you will already know much of what is presented in this documentary as the material in the film is not new. Still, even though I have watched many of the available documentaries about our war on Iraq and closely related topics -- as well as read several books on these topics -- I still learned some things by watching this DVD. Considering that we do not get in-depth journalism from our mainstream news media, and that many Americans still believe that we are fighting a war on terrorism, I feel this DVD is vital viewing for Americans."
3,A disappointment,"The Baldor arrived with a cracked wheel so the honeymoon was very short lived. Since sparks fly out the rear unabated (along with bits of wheel and tool) I bolted the grinder to a small plywood box I built to contain the sparks and other detritus that spins off any grinder and set it on a non skid mat.My main problem is with the tool rests. For this money I expect they should be solid and easy to adjust. They are neither. Unless I really crank them down, they will shift when pressing a tool down. Adjusting them with a wrench is difficult on a good day since the bolts are tucked down in between the wheels and the motor. I finally exchanged their bolts for some small plastic jig handles, so at least I can adjust them a little easier.Otherwise, the Baldor runs smoothly and quietly, now that I have unbroken wheels mounted. For such an otherwise well made machine, it was disappointing to find it such a pain to use."
2,poorly made legs fall off,"Toy has a large crack on the body between the legs, legs break off within minutes of basic use and benwolf now has to stand on his tail.Great idea , poorly made. I was warned by previous review of the crack but within minutes of opening it legs were off didn't get a chance to see if it was cracked in pkg....suspect it was. Dont pump his back too hard or DNA slime sticks to the front of the chest cavity"
2,"Decent, but requires work","The leather is so new when you get it, that's it's too tight to operate the Zen through the leather until it stretches out. I've been keeping my Zen in the leather case for about a month now, and I still have to take it out to push the play, menu, back and shortcut buttons. The beltclip is nice, but when I was walking with it clipped on, it flopped around a lot, and wouldn't be good for jogging or exercising. Also, the 'kick stand' didn't work very well; it kept folding itself back up, causing the player to fall over. Lastly, the black leather is leaving stains on the white parts of my Zen, so that when it's not in the case, it looks really dirty. I don't recommend it, but I'm not planning on sending it back."
3,Creative Zen Leather Case,"I bought this case for my personnal Creative Zen. While the case is made well and has a protective clear cover over the display screen, it isn't very functional when being used. On the Zen there are buttons around the touch mouse. With the leather case on, I have a very difficult time using these buttons. Most of the time, I just slip the Zen out of the case just to fast forward through a song. Not what I had visioned when purchasing this case."
1,"Good for large distribution systems, Terrible for isolated power and distribution systems","If your applications are mostly isolated power systems such as marine systems that have no connection to a public utility, this manual is virtually useless. All definitions, limits, and procedures are geared for utility systems that utilize heavy motor or sinusoidal loads with little or no harmonic distortion generated that are the sigificant majority of the power system loading. For isolated power systems where the large power consumers such as solid state motor drives, electronic equipment, etc. are 80-90% of the total load, this standard is rendered virtually useless in those applications because the Point of Common Coupling is the entire power grid. This makes this standard very difficult to meet without costly draconian measures that sometimes make projects economically unfeasible."
2,This batteries do not last,"I used several Sony batteries for my cammera, and only after some recharges, their capacity is notably reduced. Also, despite the fact I discharged all the battery before the next re-charge.Of the 10 sony batteries that i have, i throwed away 7 because they do not re-charge anymore, and the other three last only for a few photos after they are recharged.I purchased cheeper generic re-chargeable batteries with better duration."
5,Grace Like A River - Christopher Parkening,A summary of Christopher Parkening's recording career. Good selection of material.
4,gibraltar has strong aftermarket products!,Recently purchased bass drum spurs from gibraltar and was happy to note they make professional stage quality hardware you can depend on long term for your needs. often better than the factory option!
1,No merit or originality to this book,"This book has no original ideas in it. It's just another one of those: 1) think positive and everything will magically be alright 2) God loves you and jesus will save you if you have faith. Bunch of BS. There is no good information or techniques, there are no original thoughts and there is no ""how to"" information. Interesting title, horrible read. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Average at best,The belt clip fell off in 13 days - 10 days of use!! I contacted AccessoryOne for a replacement but the best they'll do is replace it and shipping each way is my responsibility. A poor product backed by poor service! Not a very happy customer.
2,DID NOT WORK,"NO AFFECT AT ALL...WASTE OF $15. EASY TO USE, BUT ABSOLUTLY NO AFFECT AFTER USING HALF THE BOTTLE..AND NO RETURNS"
1,too much trouble,I am a grandmother who buys whatever by grandson wants (with in reason) and wish I had skipped this one Spent better part of a Saturday trying to put together and still not done Tried to add new sections and the previous would come together Use to love Lego type systems with my son but wish this were still in store
3,artists review,"The product and theory are good as color transparency is contrasted with similar color that is opaque or partly so. Also, the color mixtures are of interest. Finding the color green you would like to use is demonstrated, for example. The size of the publication is disappointing as it is quite small, desirable to some as it could fit in a pocket, but not to me as the color swatches are too small for analysis without a magnifying glass, in my opinion."
5,Must have for every artist,"Must have for every artist, it is so easy to understand!I let my daughter (an artist) use it and now I'll have to order another one for myself!"
3,"OK for the price, but...","I received my new set bits two weeks ago. The case could be sturdier: I had to bend the interior bit holders a little to get some of the bits out. I have only used them on wood so far and have broken one (due to mild abuse in a powerful drill press). A few bits were not straight before I even used them. They seem to stay sharp for an average length of time. I know that if I want a real nice 115 bit machinist's set I could pay over $400, so I consider this product an OK deal for the price. It is ""discount"" quality, though. If you are bothered by opening a new set and finding some bits bent, save your money for a better set."
1,"the uninportance of ""The Being""","any movie that starts in the middle can't be oscar worthery the lead actor's voice is dubed by James Keach (not sure if spelling is right), brother of Stachy Keach (see above),husband of ""Dr. Quinn"", and producer of ""Walk the Line"". I did enjoy ruth buzzi's death scene tho!!! Still i did find it very funny and great for a bad movie night with friends!!! (talk back to the screen as much as you like)"
3,"""The Green Death"" Review correction:","I would like to point out an error in my review. ""The Green Death"" was written by Robert Sloman, and not Malcolm Hulke."
5,Curious George Helps Baby Boy Go To Sleep,This sweet stuffie has aided in the transition from crib to bed... and it's adorable to boot!
4,Curious George,I purchased this toy for my two year old granddaughter as a gift. She just loves it and pretends its her baby pet.
5,Bedtime buddy!,My son loves Curious George & this one sleeps with him! He loves his pajamas and squeezes him tight every night for bed. So happy we found him!
4,"Rigid 18"" wrench","What's to say if you work with wrenches daily like I do you need a quality light weight wrench. Rigid is the best, Reed is a close second then you move down to Lenox and store brands. You can count on a Rigid aluminum wrench to last for years of daily abuse. Normally if I'm buying a new wrench I've misplaced my old one."
5,good job,"good product, packaged and shipped properly. I like doing business with this company. I will do it again. yes. yes."
1,not widescreen as advertised,"This DVD was advertised as having a widescreen aspect ratio, but it wasn't. I've had to file a complaint against the seller because I haven't heard back from him on returning the movie for a refund."
5,Oldie but a goodie,"We watched Grumpy Old Men, and had too watch the its sequel, Grumpier Old Men. The acting is superb! It's Lemon and Matthau at their absolute best. How greatly missed these two colossal giants of Hollywood are. They really don't make um like this anymore.Absolute treat to snuggle up on the couch on a cold night and watch these two comedic giants do their absolute best work. Truly a treat."
4,Just about as good as the money you put into it.,"This software is pretty good. It's a bit more complicated than Apple's iMovie and a little clunky, but does everything you could want for a good price. I'm quite put off myself that you have to pay extra to make video CD's, but overall it is a good product."
2,They want your Money!,"I bought this product because the box says ""Burn your videos onto CDs for playback in most DVD players."" When tried to do this, a window pops up telling me I have to buy a ... plug-in for MPEG1 or MPEG2. I am very upset. The box also advertises downloading free video clips. If you try to do tis, you are solicited to buy more software. There is nothing ""free"" about his product."
3,Too Salty,"I am very fond of Gustaf's licorice Cats, and licorice Buttons, and have had a subscription for about two years. Today I recieved the coins to try for the first time, and I must say I found them a bit salty to enjoy. My rating reflects my palate and personal taste, not the quality of the product, which is extremely good."
3,Good candy but too tough,"These are much more palatable for the uninitiated thanGustaf's Dutch Licorice, Double Salt, the flavor is right in-between, neither too sweet nor too salty. However, I have to say I like the others better, the coins are much too chewy for my taste and don't really dissolve very well; little bits often get stuck in my teeth instead. Think of chewing a stale tootsie roll. I'm not sure if mine are getting stale or if they're just made that way, I don't think I'll order more for a while. I'd love to have a variant of these with a little bit stronger licorice flavor and less tough chewiness. Maybe I'll try the cats next."
5,Fits my new HandHeld Garmin GPS76Csx Perfectly,The product arrived on time with no problems. A great product for the price. I would only suggest to Garmin to pad the product better which would protect my GPS from shock and possible damage. It should be toughened and suitable for rugged terrain and marine use. I am very with my case though.Thanks
2,Does not fit Rino 655t,Purchased the Rino 655t & this showed up as an add-on Item to purchase. The case is to short for the Rino 655t & does not zip all the way closed! It is a nice case but just does not work for my Item. It should not be advertised as such!
2,don't fit 655T,the case doesn't fit the Rino 655T. other than that it's ok. should have been checked before it was offered.
3,Mildly disappointed.,"As a longtime admirer of Lesley Gore's work, it's nice to have all these oddball singles collected in one place. Through no fault of the compilers, it really doesn't hold together as a listen, even the cancelled ""Magic Colors"" album part. It's a bumpy mishmash of songwriting styles and producers, and overall a bit sad watching Mercury drop the ball as it tries to define a new niche for Ms. Gore by dragging her all over the musical map. She deserved better. Notes and packaging are up to Ace's exemplary standards, but this is really a gift to completists (like me)."
5,Best Soap Ever,This is by far the best hand soap made.. I work on cars and my hands get covered in grease and dirt.. This stuff takes it off better then any other hand cleaner on the market.. I will never use anything else..
5,This IS INDEED A COMPLETE CONFESSIONS!,"The Catholic Book Publishing edition (448p) is a complete edition of the Confessions. The negative reviews here must be referring to a different edition. And not only is this edition complete, it is really wonderful as well. The translations is excellent, fluid and beautiful. This is my favorite Confessions."
4,"Hey, part of it is missing!!!","The Augustine part is fine and the translator did a wonderful job, but why were the parts edited out? Saint Augustine was just like us in his struggles to not only come to Christianity but also to live the Christian life after his conversion. He writes about his screw-ups, failures, and triumphs in such a humble, heart rendering manner I wish I had articulated it that way first. All Christians should have this book in their library to be read and re-read often. PAX, bb"
1,Misleading advertisement,"This advertisement is completely misleading. It states that it will fit a Sony P93. In fact, it does not. It is too small for a P93. I brought one based on the ad and now I have a useless item. Don't buy this if you have aSony P93. I don't know if it will fit any of the other it claims since I don't have those cameras."
4,The only game in town,"I have used the Bosch hinge template for 10 years in a market where most doors are 8ft and can range any where from 6.8 to 10ft, in this market this is the standard tool for hanging doors, it is flexible, simple and easily modified for custom applications (we cut wood spreaders for custom hieghts), the engineering meets the mail, but the newest version of this product is poorly constructed, I have a problem with parts falling off of the jig, parts that should not fall and in older versions fell with great reluctance. If the competition did not have this problem I would not recomend this product, but they do so I must say it is the best in its field. If you hang custom doors this tool is your best bet."
4,up close,"Such a great movie. Filled with all the right drama.....happiness, sadness and perseverence. Michelle Pfeiffer couldn't have given a more perfect performance and Robert Redford was right behind her giving it back. Great love story..."
2,In the Year of the Boar and Jackie Robinson,"This book In The Year Of The Boar And Jackie Robinson by Bette Bao Lord is meant for children about 12 or 13 years. The story starts in China but most of it happens in Brooklyn, New York in America. The author's descriptions are so good that I can picture most of it in my mind. I think the main character Shirley seems like a real person because she has the same problems as most of us would have. The book is a story about friendship and sport. This type of book is ""coming of age"" (teen years). At the beginning of the book we learn about Shirley life in China but then she had to move to America and everything was new to her an d she felt lonely. Same than me, when I came to New Delhi, India, from Austria I felt very lonely, too. In the beginning she didn't have any friends. I didn't like the book because there is no adventure, it's all about a girl's life."
4,"Loved the poster, but...","It arrived damaged. I contacted the seller immediately and did not hear back for months. Long story short, I still have a damaged poster."
3,Not Worth the Money!,"Probably not a good book for trained accountants. And, the price is just outrageous. If you don't know much about accounting, or how unearned income works you could benefit from this book. But, it's actually worth about $20.00."
4,A gem of an album,"Ex-Thrush Hermit frontman and his new trio offer an album that gushes with 70s power pop and blues, with a strong dash of country.""This is a Message"" evokes memories of Elvis Costello while ""Maybe We Should Just Go Home"" brings into mind Big Star, and ""Waiting to be Discovered"" sounds like a Neil Young b-side.. However, Plaskett weaves his influences into songs that still sound fresh and unique. Not a single weak track is to be found.If there's anything bad about the album, it's the underproduced sound that leaves some of the songs lacking in noise and power. ""True Patriot Love,"" especially, suffers because it's got the riffs and introspective lyrics that should have made it a radio staple. Kudos for finding something to rhyme with 'Saskatchewan.' Otherwise, this is a fantastic CD that won't leave your CD player for weeks."
4,It works,"This is a great filter for use in B&W photography, it really punches up blue skys in images."
5,Learning Arabic the effective way-at last!,"This course is excellent.The picture-clues help commiting this difficult language to memory. One can start using what one has learnt straight away and the amount of vocabulary and grammar is just right to take in and begin to consolidate in 15 minutes as well as to remember and rehash during the day.As opposed to many other language methods, each day's content is just right to commit to memory permanently, making this a very efficient and encouraging course. I have tried to learn Arabic 4 times now, either through courses or selfstudy, but have never succeeded. Now I am.This method should be used in schools to help children gain enough knowledge of a language fast enough to make them feel it is worth to learn a language well."
4,Good travel book,"I bought this book for an interview trip. It fits nicely in your coat pocket and is durable. This book is a good review of the best of American and Japanese management ideas for motivating people. As promised on the backcover, the presentation is excellent. The text is a good review no new material is presented. That is why I give it only 4 stars.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
2,poca luz,"Funciona bien, pero la luz que emite es igual de débil que los pequeños led que trae la cámara: sólo ilumina escasamente 1 metro o metro y medio"
4,"Nice hardware, but...","Everything is solid as you would expect, but plan on buying extra router bits, collars, and jamb gauges depending on the size of hinges and the corner radius of the hinges."
4,Great tool!,I use this butt template when I have to install a new slab door that is not made to fit an eisting door jam in a house. You get to cut the new door the exact same as the old door to make it easier to install.
5,Great jig,"I found this jig to be very robust and quite simple to use. Don't get to caught up in the instructions.Just use a little common sense, and you will be fine. The set up takes a little time, but the results are well worth the effort. Glad I bought it!!!"
5,Great Film!,"Considering this film was released in 1965, the special effects WERE cutting-edge at the time. Despite what others have written, there IS a plot to this film. And as far as the acting goes, take it from a naive Japanese speaker -- the acting was just fine. All-in-all, I'd say this was a well done Japanese scifi film."
5,A kaiju classic getting upgrade..............,"Most of the time I prefer the a.i.p., or the English dubbed version of these films. But in the case of the first Gamera movie I have to go with the original Japanese print. The original Japanese print is sorter, and the story gets more involve about a boy with his pet turtle. The a.i.p. version adds American actors with a running time 87mins. Which makes the movie boring. The Japanese print gets rigt to the point. I strongly recommend picking this up."
2,Gamera in black and white?,"I am not a big Gamera fan (I am a Godzilla fan, but I'm putting him aside of this review so I give Gamera a fair trial). This movie had many problems with it.1. Gamera's fire. Sure it looked real if you ignored the disturbingly visable tube that it is coming from.2. The cartoonie flying effects. Enuff said.3. The lousy plot. A giant flying turtle who likes little kids? C'mon!4. The little kid. Someone finally found a kid more annoying than Ichiro (notice I said Ichiro not Godzilla) from Godzilla's Revenge (even though he was not as annoying as the Pepsi girl).5. (Which probably bugs me most) It's in Black and White! This film was made in 1965, Toho started using color in the late 50's with Rodan (notice I said Rodan, not Godzilla). Now I don't have anything against black and white movies, but this fact just bothered me!I'm not saying that no one should watch this movie, I'm just saying it's not for me."
5,Finally! The Flying Turtle Gets Respect!,"After many years and cheap, SLP-mode speed video re-releases of various titles from the ""Gamera"" movie series, someone gives the giant, flying turtle the respect he deserves. This video is the original Japanese film, letterboxed with English subtitles. The print of the film is superb and the story tells a slightly different story than the American cut. While not the terrible monster that Godzilla started out to be, Gamera was a fast favorite of Japanese children. This movie, with its surprising ending, will be a great film for kids and for parents to relive their memories of the flying turtle."
3,Southern Humor with a Twist,"If you are not from the South , you won't understand or appreciate this, if you are....well get it!! Ever listened to the John Boy and Billy Show? If so, you may have heard Tim, he is a regular. His song about Garth is great, as is Ricky Tidwell's Mama"" . The ""Redneck 12 days of Christmas and Clean Underwear will have you rolling..Plug this one in at your next party...lots of fun"
5,The ones who know it best,"I suppose it's a tad bit ethnocentric to assume that because Fischer and the Haydn Orchestra are Hungarian they'd be able to play Haydn better than anyone else, but in this case I feel it's true. Aside from having a high level of technical skill, the orchestra puts real verve and life into their performances. (You will never listen to another recording of the ""Military"" symphony again.) This is coupled with Fischer's flair for the dramatic; endings are rallentandoed appropriately, and each piece shines with the sense that it is being thoroughly interpreted, not just perfunctorily played through. A rather muffled-sounding recording of the ""Clock"" symphony and some blurriness in the first movement of the ""Military"" does not detract from the overall greatness of these interpretations. Ethnocentric or not, these players know what they're doing."
1,Abbie was a publicity-hound and a snitch,"As Emmitt Grogan of the Diggers said, Abbie Hoffman was a snitch. Fink, rat, stool pigeon, whichever word you prefer. For example: as soon as someone told him about them, he wrote about all the ways to get free food in NYC, which of course meant the authorities shut them all down. But Abbie got his momentary publicity buzz. Typical of how he operated his entire ""career."""
3,Lots of information with some open ended information,"I would agree with the other reviewer that this is not a ""how to"" book. The book approaches the subject from an academic viewpoint. The reader is expected to fill in between the lines with previous experience. It appears that the authors, professors as U of C, supplement the text with worked out examples for their students. I would recomend it to people already versed in the subject and want more information.I found it for half price and this makes it worth buying as a reference."
2,Very limited in phone mode,"I was quite disappointed in the phone aspect of this toy (the hippo game is fine for a 3-year-old). The entire number pad presses as a single unit and makes a random tone with each press (you cannot press different numbers individually). Also, when you close the flip phone, it doesn't hang up like a real phone would, rather it keeps dialing/talking until it finishes its conversation. And the buttons on the outside of the phone are merely decorative (other than the phone to game switch). Also it is a bit large for a child's hand. On to the positive: the voices are fairly realistic, and not too annoying. And the hinge seems pretty sturdy, I expect it will withstand quite a bit of abuse from a child."
3,good tool...........btu a little rough,i am a cabinet installer and counter top fabricator. i bought this shear for trimming laminates......the trimmer head does chip out a little when trimming p/lam. it does trim well but i cannot say that it is top notch..it will do the job for you......and is great for metal.....btu with all p/lam be careful
2,A Few Diamonds In The Rough,"Billy Idol's DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND features three of the best songs he's ever recorded--""Scream,"" ""Body Snatcher,"" and ""Summer Running."" The first two are thrilling rockers; the last is an eloquent, disarming ballad with a bomb thrown in. All three sound like natural 21st-century extensions of Idol's distinctive and spectacular ""80s sound."" Too much of the rest of DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND sounds like Green Day, and that was as surprising as it was disappointing for this fan of Idol, guitarist Steve Stevens, and drummer Brian Tichy."
3,Billy is showing his age,"As a one-time Billy Idol fan who kind of lost track of him, I was interested to see what his current output is like. Well, it's still the same kind of material, but he sounds older and tireder. A lot of the vocals sound ""mushy,"" and the lyrics lack the cutting edge of his earlier albums. I got it here on Amazon for six bucks, so I""m not really disappointed, but I'd have to say this album is kinda marginal."
4,Still Growling after all these years!,"If you liked him with ""White Wedding"", the fist-pumping ""Rebel Yell"", the fun ""Mony"" and the eery ""Dancing With Myself"" (only eerie if you've seen the video. Zombies rock!!), then you will pump your fist to this new round of grinding, crunchy, raw-edge rock. What a breath of fresh metal air!Check out the particularly edgy 'Body Snatcher' and the kooky 'Plastic Jesus', along with 'Super Overdrive' and 'Scream'!Rock on, Billy!"
4,Oh man... Billy is BACK!,"Who knew? Billy Idol practically disappears for 12 years after making Cyberpunk, and now he's back with this kickass rock'n'roll disc.All of Billy's previous efforts followed the same pattern... a couple of knock-you-down great tunes, a couple of so-so tracks and a bunch of filler. Not this time. This one rocks from beginning to end, slowing down only for a couple of acoustic-but-still-rockin' ballads and one countryish song. Don't laugh - the song, ""Plastic Jesus,"" brings to mind the Stones at their country best - somewhere between ""Dead Flowers"" and ""Faraway Eyes.""All told, there are more great riffs, hooks and lyrics on this disc than you'll find on all of his previous solo efforts. If you're a fan of any kind of hard rock (well, except maybe you nü-metal dorks), then check this out. You won't be disappointed."
4,Big Anthony: His Story,"This story in the ""Strega Nona"" series tells of the ""origin"" of Big Anthony- from his birth to his joining up with Strega Nona. On his journey to find his fortune (his family kicked him out because he did everything wrong and wouldn't listen :) ), he straightens up the leaning tower of Pisa, he visits Firenze and Roma, where he disrespected the cardinal, and Napoli, where he witnessed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.This is a wonderful picture book, and a really great edition to the incomparable Strega Nona series!"
2,"Crapy, but Well Dressed album cover is the Best thing about this mess.","First, this sounds NOTHING like Warrant. The singer is all upper register, like Lizzy Borden without the range. Guitars are the chunka-chunka-whamy bar that just truges along. Drums is all pounding on one snare. Second, the Love Potion remake is barely recognizable as the original song, it is done so poorly. This is a CBS jumping on the hair metal bandwagon circa 1989. Formula by the numbers first song an anthem, fourth and ninth song ballads predictable formula that killed music like this. But my Amazon used copy is autographed by the band members..woo-hoo. Wonder what car wash these guys are working in today."
2,weird.,"Okay so i bought it. And then when i looked on the back it said it worked for Windows XP. So i thought yeah, it will work on our computer! So i brought it home and i put the batteries in. While i was putting them in i noticed that the back part where you put them in was not very durable very flimsy. But i thought if it was fun who cares about the back part where you put in the batteries. So then i filmed a little bit and decided to install the editing software unto our computer. Well i tryed and tryed and tryed my older brother (who knows alot about electronics) tryed and it didn't work on XP, which is false advirtising because it simply stated on the back that it should work great for XP. And then we couldn't even get the camera part to work. It made very annoying little sounds, and the picture was very fuzzy and small. If i were you i would not by this product."
1,The Fun Hardly Lasts,So I ordered one of these and I couldn't wait to play with it . After I got it I started to play with it. The memory is hardly TWO MINUTES. This is only for if your making short movies. If your not buy something else!
3,Good toy but needs tweeking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a great toy to me. me and my friends always try and make little movies. However, there are a few things they could of added to make it even better! Like create your own backgrounds for your movie, or lengthen the time of a movie because it only records up to about 2 minutes. They should of added more sound effects and more special effects(the little characters and objects you can put in your movie) This to me would of made it a better toy. But like it states, its a toy, so its not goings to be like the real things the real movie directors would use anyway!But good toy!"
4,Cartoon Animations with Sound can also be created,"My son at 9 1/2 received Digital Blue and learned to use it immediately with kid understandable directions. However, what became most exciting and captivated him for hours at a time all summer (he's now 11) was his ability to draw cartoon images on a ""Paint"" program, ""save"" all the individual drawings and then import them to Digital Blue. He would also add special effect images and sounds from the Digital Blue or his own speaking into the included microphone to create an animation with fun backgrounds, noises and talking. This adds so much to the final, fairly-professional animated cartoon for a youth. The Digital Blue has really opened up his creativity! He has even taught his 6 yr. old brother the simple computer commands required that allowed him to be his own ""Car Crash Cartoon Creator"". We have really got our money's worth out of this creative ""toy"" and enjoy ""Movie Night"" with our sons, the Directors!"
1,Fell apart quickly,"Mine worked okay, but the stitching on the little band (that holds the gauge) broke after 20-30 uses."
5,A Page Turner,"Murder on Old Mission is a thoughtful, well-layered story with beautifully drawn characters and a suspensful plot line. There is something for everyone here: courtroom drama, a love triangle, a tragic loss of life, even racial tension. This book is a 'period piece' loosely based upon an actual event. Mr. Lewis successfully takes the reader on a journey into the past with rich, descriptive language. This is a great escape read!"
3,Honesty is the best quality,"Our book club enjoyed the discussion on politics which this feminist autobiography evoked, but shared no empathy with the author whose justification for being a member of the Sandanistas was unconvincing, allowing her to be judged as a promiscous, star-struck, thrill seeker motivated by the desire to shock and gain attention from her family by causing scandal within the upper echelons of Nicaraguan society. Honesty is the best quality of the writing style which used a journalistic approach rather than any poetic language."
2,Didn't feel truthful at all.,I didn't feel that this movie was being very honest with the story of Marilyn Monroe. It was just a showcase for some pretty nice bodies.
2,Pure entertainment.,"Anyone wanting to know anything about Marilyn Monroe's life, would steer clear of this movie. Not only does it depict Marilyn in a negative light, but the facts are just all wrong. If you're watching just for pure entertainment, then you will enjoy this."
4,Norma Jean and Marilyn DVD Review,An entertaining HBO film about the life of Marilyn Monroe. Lindsay Crouse has a good role as Marilyn's coach and is fine as usual. Good picture and sound.
5,Kett KD-440 metal shears,Kett KD-440 cuts 20ga stainless sheet like paper! Received item in California in just three days. Highly recommend. Excellent purchase.
3,Mistaken iDVDdentity,"I recently purchased this DVD, although the movie lacks some action , The ending fight scene is one of the best I have seen before. It is however a good DVD to own and shows the work of Yuen woo ping and how it all started. I read a review on this DVD and found the version I ordered Showing the two men fighting on the cover to be free of defect and well dubbed (for a kung fu flick) I looked back at the previos reviewers and found the version they possibly purchased was a older version which showed a sitting Monk instead."
3,Common Weeds of the United States,"It may be an arcane subject; but I wanted to know about these seemingly untamed natural ""flowers."" They have been here since our ancestors brought the majority of them in from their motherlands. Many came in the bags and cracked leather shows of the first Mayflower passengers to stepoff the boat. I wanted to know the names and habits of these seemingly uninvited guests.And now my neighbor has borrowed the book, I fear I must buy a second copy."
2,Weedy,"Ok, but not enough detail for me. Probably good for beginning plant lovers. I donated it to my local library book sale."
5,An important glimpse into the world of children living with aspergers,"If you want to understand what a child with asperger's might act like, this is the video for you! I was very impressed with the story of three boys living with asperger's. Each one had his own unique fixation and their openess and honesty about their disability was refreshing to watch!I would recommend this video to anyone wanting to know more about what asperger's really is like. Kudos to the kids!"
5,Great Book,"Jonathan Kellerman never disappoints! Loved the book, as all of her books are awesome! Must read! Don't miss out! Get it now!"
1,So disappointed,"I have listened to nearly all of Jonathan Kellerman's books and this by far was my least favorite. It was slow, but I also thought it wasn't nearly as well researched as others. I am married to a school administrator in Southern Cal and some of the assumptions the author made were not just a stretch, they just flat out would never happen. In addition I HATE the new voice. He makes Kellerman's writing sound bad! What happened to the other guy? His voice was believable and kind of ""disappeared"" so it didn't take away from the story or the writing.Go back to mystery solving and avoid the political stuff. And bring back the old voice!"
3,"Audiobook review: good Kellerman, BAD narrator","(audiobook, unabridged version) Seemed like another good one by Kellerman. It's been years since i read it in print, but this narrator is so criminally bad that it's difficult to fairly judge the merits of the book itself. Milo often sounds like a vary bad imitation of Michael Keaton's ""Betelgeuse,"" & the voices of other characters vary wildly. The women are cringeworthy. The only character who sounded 1/2way decent (the rabbi) was a minor one. The reader's voice often sounds so strained I kept getting a vision of him with fold of skin being twisted in a pair of vice-grips. And his pronunciation of many words was...well, creative (but annoying). VERY unfortunate that 'Alexander Adams' (a.k.a. Grover Gardner) didn't do all the Alex Delaware books. This reader's performance are about middle school level at best. Rather a coincidence that the word ""bomb"" is in the title."
5,Good book for EFL teachers,I am a student teacher in Hong Kong and I have used this books several times. It is easy to modify the content to suit students from different culture! The activities can really arouse the interest of students too! It is a good book for speaking activities~!
3,"Fine choice of tunes, but lacking heart","Some proven tunes are included here--classic standards, latin jazz, ""So What."" The arrangements are tightly harmonized. But there isn't enough of a jazz feel to the presentation. It sounded ""antiseptic"" to an ear attuned to jazz. Because the lead singers are mainly female, the tunes are sung mainly in the higher registers. I would have preferred more of a range in the performance. Because ""Have You Met Miss Jones"" is sung by a female, ""Miss Jones"" was sung as ""Ole Jones."" Hmm.Better than this would be ""The Real Group"" and ""Singers Unlimited."" ""The King Sisters"" executed some great jazz harmony in the middle registers, and it swung."
4,Unique & needed book for infertile AND their family/friends,"I have been searching for a book like this for a long time. Not one that is full of Christianity or medical help or help choosing a path, just one to read so I don't feel so alone, confused, and hopeless. This book let me say ""yes-that's EXACTLY how I felt/feel"" and get some emotion out as well.It's not the most eloquent or best-edited of books, but it really doesn't matter, because it fills a need in the market that is so lacking. IT IS ESPECIALLY GREAT FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. Because, let's face it, they usually just don't get it...the pain of IF is so complex and hard to explain to the fertile world, and this really does it.My appreciation to the author for putting herself out there on this one. I think it will make a lot of IF women/couples feel a lot less crazy and alone."
2,Silly,"I did not finish reading the book, although I own it. The topic could have been quite interesting, but I don't think the author has a great analysis. The first few chapters combine too much information that doesn't really fit together or contribute to a point. Near the end of the book, the author dedicates a whole chapter to BANANAS. I have no idea why this topic would be covered in this book, and the chapter seemed forced and silly. Overall, the problem with this book is that it wasn't specific enough in its intentions. The author should have been more careful about which subjects to include because she seems to go on and on without getting anywhere. Please take into consideration while reading this review that I did not finish the book."
4,"Finally, he's not the bad guy....",Saw this some years ago and had to own it .Father Gigory is such an enigma to those who have studied some of the testimonials and the history written about him. Follow this up with some good books about him like THe Rasputin Files.
1,Vastly Inferior Battery,"Power outages are infrequent in my area so I consider my use to be light duty. The batteries pretty much spend their life in the floating charge mode. The APC batteries that came with the APC Back-UPS Pro 1000 have a claimed lifetime of 3-5 years. In my case, the original batteries lasted 7 years. After 7 years use, the spent battery cases were like new.These Helios batteries only lasted 2.5 years. When they gave out and I opened the UPS to replace them, I discovered they had swollen so much that they could not be removed except with a great deal of force."
4,where are they now?,"easily the best of the no wave groups from new york circa 1979, dna is best on the seldom seen 9-minute ""a taste of dna"". but this will suffice a great performance from extremely talented non-player arto lindsey, throbbing drummer ikue mori, and beautiful bass ex-pere ubu tim wright. this could have been five star had they been able to tack on the four ""no new york"" tracks, the ""ants"" single, & ""a taste of dna"" (the disc runs about 29 minutes), but take what you can get, sporgs."
3,Not an original novel,"What no one has noted here, is that this is not an original novel. It is merely an adaptation of the film. So, you get what you ask for...if you are looking for a play-by-play of the movie on paper, this is it. If you want original fiction written by someone with fresh ideas and the desire to make you ""see"" them in your head, try Clive Barker, Anne Rice, etc. :)"
2,Disappointing,"I have read David McCullough's book on Truman twice and when I saw this video with Gary Sinise I was excited to get it. Gary did a great job acting but the story itself was too choppy. It just flitted from one highlight to the next with very little substance. Rent this one, don't buy."
4,Fine film,"Based on McCullough's excellent bio, this HBO film suffers from one thing - its only two hours long. It needed to be a TV series like John Adams. Still, they work well with what they've got and Sinise delivers a fine performance as the 33rd president, even if the make-up is a bit on the dodgy side."
4,Sinise's crowning jewel,"Brilliant made for cable film about the life of President Harry Truman. Although not a complete account of his life, this film nevertheless covers all the major events that helped shape the man. There is no better casting choice than Sinise. In one of his rare occasions as THE MAIN star of a film, his talents are brought to the surface brilliantly.HBO dvds up to this time have never been known to have many supplements on them, and unfortunately this is no exception. The live action menus are a refreshing addition. However, there are countless extras you can add when it comes to historical figures like these. There are no trailers, no documentaries. Certainly a disappointment there. Tne film itself is worth getting however. Truly a milestone for a great actor."
4,Good Movie !!,"I enjoyed ""Truman"" . I thought Gary Sinise was great as Harry S. Truman . Sometimes portraying an historical figure can be a challenge ; to be able to look , sound , and capture the personality and then be able to do it convincingly takes a talented actor / actress . Good supporting cast also . Highly recommended !!"
3,"This was very brief, I expected more","This was a very very short material, and not what you can expect from the title How-to, just not explain so much, however could say it is a good introduction if you are considering a multi-dog environment, but bad title, it is not going to tell you ""how to enjoy your multi-dog Household"". Animal Planet has more interesting material. This also for the quality of the printing feel like overpriced."
2,Not What I Expected,"I have to say that I was disappointed with this booklet. I think I should have read the description better as I was expecting a book and got a 38 page booklet.I didn't find the information all that helpful in dealing with my three-dog household. I felt most of it was in umbrella terms and there were very few specifics. Also many topics on things to do with your dogs, but for more details or the how-to's you were referred to a book-list in the back of the book.Most of the information was common sense.Probably good for beginning owners of multiple dogs but if you have owned multiples for awhile, I don't think this information will be new."
2,Disappointed...,"I too should have read the description more thoroughly. Some good advice but expensive for 38 pages. I thought I was getting a book, not a bookLET. Definitely don't feel I got a bang for my bucks."
1,Bulb dies once a month,"The original bulb in my lava lamp had lasted over 10 years. It was getting dim and not so lavaey so I decided to replace it with this. It died within a month. I replaced that. It died within a month. I replaced it again and guess what? Yep, dead within a month. This bulb is a POS. Avoid."
4,Finally found you,Couldn't find one of these around anywhere for my lava lamp. Mine works most efficiently with this particular lightbulb so I guess I can't complain about the high price.
3,Good for the money,This product does the job but the ports are a little to close together (I can't put two jump drives next to each other) and it is a little hard to put in/take out the usb devices. The product description says it comes with a 3 ft cord and the unopened box I got did not contain any.
1,It Had Potential,"The film had decent production values and a not half bad cast, but they had so little to do. As the interest in and more frequent production of Gay themed films increases, I suspect that the realism will catch up. I fear we are still being presented with one dimensional plots, characters, and productions."
5,Short and Sweet,"I'll keep this short and to the point-this movie had to have been THE best gay movies in terms of what most gay people go through when coming out. It was something about how the story was told, the sex, the facial expressions,the story line, the characters, the realness of it all. A lot was said during the movie, but it was during those times when nothing was said that made the movie stand out. The body language spoke where words couldn't. The hard hitting and bluntness of the movie made it stand out where others have failed. As one of the lines go ""So much unhappiness for such little reason"" or something like that. It was so true. Worth a purchase for sure."
5,A WINNER!,"This is a wonderful story , a well made French movie with good solid, believable performances. This movie is an ideal DVD for a ""sexually mixed"" audience , as the story sympathetically shows both sides of the ""struggle"" to accept and live with homosexuality. But please note that it's not heavy and depressing... no, it's an uplifting movie, and thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended. (By the way - it's an insult that EATING OUT is recommended together with this movie-- I don't know what criteria is used to ascertain this match, but rest assured - this movie is ART, while ""EATING OUT"" is garbage)"
2,poor quality,"The internal gears broke twice in the first few months. The first time it was fixed under warranty. I haven't bothered the second time. Previously I owned a 3/8 drive right angle sioux from the mid-80s. It was a great drill, but I needed the half inch chuck. Since then, snap on tools bought sioux and cheapened the internals of the drill. I'm a Buy American nut and I feel incredibly ripped off. Also, this same drill is sold under the Milwaukee label."
2,"Amazing guitar, but shoddy attempt at a story","It pains me to have to give any Buckethead album such a low score as this, but I feel that I simply have to. While this CD does contain some amazing guitar playing and a few very strong pieces, but I think that the attempt to make the whole follow a story-line was, put mildly, rather unsuccessful--a lot of the intermission pieces seem to have no point at all. That isn't to say that this album is all-bad--quite the contrary. The opening theme is amazing, the long track ""Computer Master"" shows Buckhead's versatility, and the ""Home Run Derby"" main theme is easily Buckethead's best.It has its great moments, but only moments."
3,Sacred Geometry,"A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday. I read it every morning for several months in DC. Having researched this topic before, I was delighted to have this edition to my library.For those who still live on another planet, there is sacred geometry of Washington, D.C. It goes way way back! One just needs to do a little research to support this.The book at times is very detailed, but incredible insightful. Nicholas R. Mann did his homework and offers great insight into Pierre Charles L`Enfant, the architect who had a great vision and had the initial plans for the new democratic republic. But, over the centuries, imbalances and other roadblocks crept into this plan. And this is what the books is all about.From the Masons, to the Founding Fathers, and throw in a little ancient Egypt too - you will be satisfied if this is your topic! The book also has several diagrams and charts that are useful.I recommend it."
5,Wonderful Series,I loved it. Excellent and uplifting stories amid a hard time period. It gives the viewer a good feeling about human nature and about the sincerity and unselfishness of many. Quality quality quality!
5,Perfect,"Great music, costumes, characters, content and fantastic acting. Another great job from the BBC. Please keep quality story telling coming."
5,Call The Midwife....great series!,"Love this series, funny, sad...great watch! The character development is wonderful. Makes me want to watch more. I highly recommend it."
4,Very Entertaining,Terrific acting and compelling characters. Interesting view of London and medical technology in the '50s. Reminds me somewhat of the Bramwell series.
5,"If you like Downton Abbey, you might like this, too","Captivating and often emotional. Had characters you cared about and gave you a real glimpse into the world then. I watched this while doing chores (Christmas cards, wrapping, etc.) and it made the time just fly by."
4,"Fun, relaxing viewing","""Call the Midwife"" lacks the depth of a show like ""Downton Abbey"" but made for fun light viewing. It's surprisingly lighthearted, given the subject matter - good for a lot of laughs."
4,Call the Midwife,Very poignant and great sets and acting. I'm a nurse and find this series to be a wonderful testimony to the power of good healthcare providers.
3,Call the Midwife DVD,"I did not realize it was not compatible with my DVD player and that there were different formats. My fault for not understanding this I guess but unless I can determine how to play it, it's not useful."
3,Double-check that the version you order contains The Vatican episode,"The Frys Electronics near Seattle actually had this on the shelves for sale on May 1st. The DVD available for early-sale did not include ""The Vatican"" episode. Full disclosure was evident, as the back cover clearly stated that the Vatican Episode was not included. At the same time, the top cover also stated that the DVD was ""The Complete Seventh Season"" which, on it's face, did not appear completely accurate. I ended up putting the DVD back on the shelf, and will wait for P&T to release the REAL Complete Seventh Season DVD that contains all 10 episodes. Again, this review is based on an early-sale copy from a merchant who made the DVD available for general sale a few days before its official release."
1,didn't buy due to lost vatican episode,"I was going to buy this video as a gift, but refuse now due to them editing out the vatican episode. Here is my dollar vote show time!"
3,A bigger bag,This is a nice bag that easily holds my Canon Powershot AND an older Pentax SLR camera. It is definitely larger than I expected. More like a mini-pack size. This is not the bag for just protecting your digital camera but useful if you need to carry multiple cameras or other equipment.
5,Get your glow sticks out because this is awesome!,"Balanced with killer drum cadences, sound samples, orchestrations, and a fast rythem you will be firing up the dance floor or your own living room!Topmodelz keeps the song comming fresh and alive with a new beat around every corner. I've added it to my music shelf and you should too! DJ's...play this song at the hight of the dance floor's excitement!"
4,"Sioux 8005S 3/8"" Variable Speed Reversing Drill","This unorthodox shaped drill is intended for ""close quarter drilling"" applications and suits this purpose beautifully. As a woodturner, I was prompted to buy one to facilitate power sanding in small vessels that was impossible with a conventional drill. It also proved ergonomically well designed for routine drilling, and the variable speed feature allowed accurate starting position. The higher speed range (2500rpm compared to 1300rpm for the 8000S) permits faster, cooler drilling, and the high power was demonstrated by boring a 3/8"" hole in 2"" thick hard oak in just a few seconds. This tool can be used at low speed to drive screws, but lacking a clutch, care must be taken, The instruction sheet recommends returning the drill annually to a Sioux service center, but a list of locations of these centers isn't included."
1,ABC News UpClose: Tiger Woods,"I hope that I am the only one to write a review- why? Because I hope nobody is DAFT enough to pay $15.00 for 22 mins of anything! I can remember when you could get S*X for that!Seriously, paying for a DVD that gives 60-90 mins of some great golf tournement is OK- but this is ridiculous."
4,Semper Fi,"I think what I like is there is no BS in this book. Mr. Culbertson tells the story like it happened. War is never a good thing, but the Marines serve proudly where ever they are.Semper Fi Marine!!!"
1,"really bad, [let down]","I have read ALL the books on sniping in Vietnam and this one is without equal when it comes to being a lousy read. It has so little about actual sniping the title should be A GRUNT IN ARIZONA! I feel I have been seriously [let down] by buying this, and it's difficult for me to say the word 'book'. There are so many trully good sniping books out there, don't waste your time and money on this joke. I hope Culbertson was a better Marine than writer. If not, he surelly must have gotten many a good Marine killed. I recommend ONE SHOT, ONE KILL and THE LONG RANGE WAR over this piece of garbage."
2,Miss Leading Title,"The book contains very little about snipers, even though it talks about a sniper assigned to a grunt unit. There is little sniping recounted in it. It's mostly about marine grunts, and their experiences there."
1,Waste of money!,"There are so many good books about Marine sniping and Vietnam there's no need to waste your money on this book. I agree with a couple other reviewers, the title would suggest this book is about snipers and there is virtually nothing there in that respect. Shy away from this one!"
2,Suckered in by the Title.,I cant believe I paid good money for this excuse for a book. I was like a few others I suspect..suckered in by the title. Some of this authors ? comments concerning himself and what he thinks of some of our special forces have to be seen to be belived. I dont doubt he was a decent marine. I do however think there is way to much fluff and filler in this book. It was so boring I couln't finish it. Semper Fi.
4,Good picture all the way...,"Bought this HD-Ready TV 2 years ago. Excellent picture for regular cable TV. DVD movies on this TV are awesome. Sound is good, but could be better. In my opinion CRT TVs show better pictures quality for high def then LCDs or plasma. Some day that will change, I am sure, but for now CRT HD-Ready is excellent, and affordable, if you can find one it stores now days!!."
2,"Lengthy, boring and lack of focus","Compared with the first volume, this one is really boring and lengthy. And for those extra pages, few seems to be useful. The examples are not very helpful."
4,DO bother with this book,"In the three months I've been programming Java I've gotten a decent handle on the basics, and even on some more advanced concepts (inner classes, design patterns, etc.). So if you're at that level, I think that like me you will find this book to be helpful.For instance, it took me just an hour or two going over this book's section on Advanced Swing, and I was creating a tree view of files/folders for my current work project. Like Flanagan's ""Java Examples in a Nutshell"", it's a good intermediate book with lots of code, but with more explanations."
1,Don't bother buying Fushitsusha's cd,This is diffenitly one of the worst cd's I have heard in my entire life. I downloading the mp3 and could not beleave that this group could even get a record deal! If I where you spend your money on anything besides this.
5,Great Product - others that write bad reviews - just don't seem to pay attention ..,"This product is wonderful. The reason why some of the other people have had a hard time with this adapter is that the powertip system sticks out a bit from the back of the Mac. If you are not careful with how you handle your laptop with the power connected - it can easily break the tip or the power connector to your Mac. The stock power connector has a very small head and it is rounded. The Kensington smartip system has what I would call a very ""normal"" type of connector. The downside to this mobile power freedom - is that you have to watch how the plug is resting on whatever surface you happen to be computing on.Otherwise - great device, power my mac anywhere and charge my ipod to boot! Comes with the three tips listed in the tech details.The tips are not poorly made and do their job as designed - just watch the connector !!"
2,Maintaining connection is tricky,"I bought this unit when my other travel adapter would not maintain a connection. I still have the problem with this unit, though it is not quite so extreme. The tip will make a connection only when it is in precisely the proper position. I have to secure the cord under my Al PowerBook so it doesn't move, then rotate the tip and bend the cord until a connection is made--and watch for several seconds to be sure the connection is maintained. Without an indicator light on the tip, the only way I can be sure I still have a connection is by continually looking at the battery indicator on the menu bar. Many times I don't notice I have lost the connection until I get a low battery warning. Never a problem with the original Apple adapter. I use this adapter only because my setup makes it very inconvenient to take the Apple adapter with me."
2,Low quality DVD,"I see this match before on my HD net work TV, and I think the match was very excited. How ever I am very disappoint for the quality of the British DVD. I mean if you want to record and sale the best match like this at less create a professional recording system. The picture quality is very poor. I think it below 480p.My VCR picture is better. There are no chapter section options. The commentary is the British which is not good. I wish he is John McEnroe. If you want to sale the DVD like this, let American Net work record them!!"
2,Bob Wall: A Legend In His Own Mind,"The best thing about this dvd is the old black & white footage of Chuck Norris, Joe Lewis, Benny Urquidez & other prominent karate champs of the 60s & 70s in tournament competitions, but there's not enough here to justify the price. As for the ""star"", Mr. Wall, listen to the title song once (I think it's repeated at least 3 times throughout the main program) & see if you don't agree this guy's a legend in his own mind. Most of the dvd consists of him & his buddies talking about what a great guy he is & his apparently invaluable contributions to martial arts in America.I would recommend this only for diehard Bob Wall fans, but I can't actually imagine there being any. What's his claim to fame other than spending some time with such genuinely famous & influential people as Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, & Elvis Presley? If you're still curious enough to buy this, don't say you weren't warned."
5,One of the best cookbooks I ever used,"This is a great cookbook, particularly for its meatless recipes which don't require you to spend the whole day in the kitchen.Some of its information is a little out-of-date, such as saying it is necessary to combine plant proteins (i.e. beans and rice) at each meal, but overall it is a highly responsible wonderful cookbook."
5,I've used this book for almost 30 years,"This was my ""bible"" for cooking for the first decade of my adult life, and I still use many of the recipes frequently. I have bought it as a bridal shower gift several times."
5,cooking,if you like the cookbook simply in season you will like this cookbook. good wholesome recipes to feed a good amount of people

Please try to buy it. ATB mixed really good. Make sure you get the U.S.single because it has more mixes & remixes then the UK single. Ciao!!!!"
1,Not good!,"The slightly salty licorice has little licorice flavor, but a very unpleasant ammonia taste! Don't expect a slight salt tang, its an overpowering awful ammonia flavor."
2,DVD,Item bought for the 1966 Benny Goodman content which was non existent. The Benny Goodman content was actually 1958 which I already had.
4,16 month old loves the swing.,"Our 16 month old grandson loves to come to our house and swing. Even on cold, rainy days he wants to swing. The swing creates 2 elements, laughter and relaxation. As the Grandmother in charge, I like the safety factor. I do not worry about him falling out. Also he cannot release the safety straps. Great swing!"
4,Big lists for such a small book.,"While the title is close to the truth, some parts of these lists are incomplete. E.G. When one is getting a weight or measure there are no metric listings and for those of us who use metric primarily the concept of an ounce is a bit confusing as there is more than one form and all have no underlying principle of a standard. For what the book does cover it is a very good reference material."
4,Chasing the Dragon,"You can't keep a good girl down, and Modesty's the best. Lose her in the middle of the ocean, alone on a yacht and you can bet she'll find trouble. This time round a rescue at sea pitches Modesty into the hands of some daring Art Thieves. Who is their mysterious backer, and where is the loot being stored? Leave it to Modesty and Willie to turn the tables on the bad guys and come out (relatively) unscathed. They even have time to practise their latest hobby in the middle of a fight for survival. That takes dedication. Dragon's Claw is hard to find, harder than most Modesty titles, but go find it: you'll be glad you did."
3,"Just OK ... too larger for 13"" Dell XPS and pocket is too small for power cords","This thing wants to be a slip laptop sleeve but it is too big. But then it's too small to fit in accessories. It works for my store while charging at home use, but it is not real practical for use on the move."

1,Not worth the money,"The book was poorly writen, often repeating the same idea multiple times within a paragraph, making the material harder to understand due to sentice structure and unrelated tangents. While this book is required for some classes, if you can get by without it, do so. Perhaps they will write a better one soon."
