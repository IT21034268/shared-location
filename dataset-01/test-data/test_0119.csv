3,Memoirs of an Ex Prom Queen,"Fun read with some interesting insights about love, loss, adventure, regret and freedom. Fast paced, with the flavor of some of the previously written books on women making their way in what is still a 'man's world'."
2,Not impressed,I don't think this is at all a feminist work or even that interesting at all. It seemed very disjointed and frankly depressing.
2,"Well written, but depressing","My ""stars"" are for overall enjoyability. If I were rating on technical/artistic merit alone, I'd probably rate it higher. It's well written, and it's a different kind of writing than a lot of what is out there these days. It's also a unique perspective -- really about a woman born before her time. She's a fairly sympathetic character, despite being breathtakingly selfish and self-absorbed.My overall low rating is because of the way the book ends. It simply...ends. It doesn't wrap anything up. I don't need a book to have a happily-ever-after, rainbows-and-unicorns ending, but this was abrupt. And depressing. And therefore not the entertainment I'm looking for when I read."
2,Got through it...barely.,"The author's writing skills lacked in developing how the main character's desire to be independent came about other than to infer she didn't want to be dependent on a man like her mother and friends. Taking up with undesirable men and living in dangerous situations just to get by for a time didn't make for an interesting story and were more disgusting than entertaining. She eventually ""settled"" for marriage and children... true for many womens lives, but certainly not a cathartic journey for the reader. Needed more feeling and insight into her psyche as to how and why she made the decisions she made which seemed to go against everything she set out to accomplish after high school. It didn't feel like the usual ""love conquers all""; felt like she gave up on her goals. Guess I just didn't like the story or the way it was presented."
3,Hilarious,"Through and through- this movie was entertaining. Typical story of revenge, but with hilarious, unconnecting (dare I say, senseless?) violence. Clever altogether, not exactly a box-office hit, but definitely worth purchasing on DVD."
2,worst special fx ever!,ok its a gorefest but common! those effect look very cheap and in one shot u can see the hose spittng blood hahahahah! the machine girl is hot n thats great but some of the actors need a lot of training or the director needs a crash curse on directing! it has great shots n nice photography but the effects were very very cheap
1,Machine Girl dissapointment,Machine girl ...the best parts are in the trailer. Not recommended. Loved the trailer.Cheers.
1,Not what I expected,"I expected this was going to be a video game like I would get for a Gameboy with video screen and all that, but it turned out to be a bunch of ink-drawn characters that look so stupid it wasn't even fun to play. I will re-wrap the thing and give it to Toys for Tots. The seller should have been more specific as to the graphics on the game because they totally suck. This gets a big fat F review."
5,A truly fantastic album...,"While working at the American Embassy in London in the mid to late 70s, I attended a Supertramp concert and Chris de Burgh was back up. I had never heard of him, but when the entire audience at Earls Court sang every word to every song, I felt in awe. I have been a devout Chris de Burgh fan since..."
2,mama not remembered,I first saw this remarkable film on the big screen and found it quite unforgettable with the warmth of the family surrounded by the centerpiece of a mama who was there for everyone. I was glad to purchase the VHS tape when it came out and found the tape transfer quite equal to the theater presentation. I thought the film presentation would be even better on DVD; HOWEVER in the DVD VERSION MAMA AND HER FAMILY AND SAN FRANCISCO ARE LOST IN MUDDY IMAGES that comes between the viewer and the story. What a great disappointment.
4,I Remember Mama,"It was a bit long! It is, however, a true classic. Irene Dunne is a superb actress. Good family movie."
4,It really was a 5.....,I remember Mama was one of those movies that bring back a time your parents talked about...like they walked 5 miles to school everyday...kind of memory....and in this way it brought me closer to my roots....I think that this movie helped me see why my Mom did things the way she did...that may have always baffled me..And the story being told as a first person narrative..the little girl speaking...was wonderful...this is a movie for those who love nostalgia...old movies....Others that evoke a similar feeling are It's a wonderful life...A tree grows in Brooklyn...Life with Father...and to some extent...Little Women...I am thinking here of the first person narrative...which is similar to I remember Mama and the overall feel of the book
5,Soft for Children but Great for Dogs,"A great frisbee. Easy to control and flies true. It evens withstands gusts of wind that try to take it off course. However, the best reaction is from my Polish Lowland Sheepdog, Wilby. He gives it a 5 Paw rating. It is easy to catch,soft in the mouth and able to withstand assaults by strong teeth. It is his favotite without a doubt. His other two frisbees lay in the grass untouched since the Superdisc arrived."
3,Wrong listings,"""On this CD"" is a completely wrong list of 21 show tune tracks from something else. Samples are apparently correct."
3,"Great Singing, So-So Songs","Joi wrote and produced this album herself. She sounds divine. Nearly every song, however, is a wafer-thin ballad. The album would have benefited from more instruments and energy. The arrangements are heavy on numbing R&B percussion. But oh, that voice! ""Superstar,"" a cover of The Carpenters hit, is a pleasure. ""Be My Baby"" is lovely too, although it sounds like a buildup to some full-fledged anthem that never appears. Maybe Joi will remix it for her club audience; it's aching for a trance treatment. Speaking of remixing, the album's last track, ""Last Chance for Love,"" gets an excellent remix on the maxisingle (also available on Logic Pride Vol. 2)."
3,A quick start,"This isn't a great book, but it's not that bad either. If you are new to Microsoft Project Server, I recommend this book. The author steps the reader ""step-by-step"" through how to evaluate and install Project Server 2002 in an enterprise environment. The book recommends to start with a pilot installation-a smart way to get started.The book covered SharePoint Team Services but it also indicates SharePoint Team Services is not a full-blown powerful enterprise document library. It suggests some alternatives as full-blown document library.I think the book has covered most basics about Project Server 2002. It doesn't have much information on advance topics such as SOAP with Project Server."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've seen enough negative reviews on this book that it should have been enough for me, but I bought the book anyway. Most of what's covered in the book is available on the install CD, or at MS's Knowledge Base. I had trouble with all of the configuration and communication between PWA, Sharepoint, and IIS - how to set these up, what to do to make them communicate, what some of the basic error messages mean and how to resolve them. None of that was in the book. Everything else the book covers is either self-explanatory (in the software), or on the CD. This book is a complete waste of money."
2,I Shouldn't Have Expected Too Much,"Because it was really cheap, I shouldn't have expected it to last very long, and it didn't. It's flimsy, and one of the latches on one of the legs didn't last long before it stopped being functional and I had to tape it up with electrical tape to get the tripod to stay upright."
1,Not wrth buying,"I was suckered into this purchase by the overall ratings. It is so flimsy that I am almost afraid to use it. I won't return it, though, because the cost of return shipping would be nearly what I paid for it."
3,Not bad but does not hold over 2.5lbs,"Used it both with a Nikon camera and an Acer projector (weighing far less than the stated 7lbs. capacity). Very light weight and reasonable build for the price. Worked well with the camera, however, I could not lock the tripod so that the projector remains level. Therefore, from my experience consider this unit good for devices up to 2.5lbs."
3,Tradeoff... Price for Quality,This product came with an enticing price. Do not get this product if you want a tripod that is actually durable and sturdy. Purchase this if you want an affordable flimsy tripod.
1,cheap and it shows,"Granted the item didn't cost much but even at that it's not worth it. Frail, wobbly, and appears that it will fall apart with any use. My biggest beef was the shipping. It was shipped in a huge box that absolutly was not necessary with all the packing materials. No need for that and the shipping cost was reflected in what I paid for. Save yourself the time and money and don't order this."
3,Cheap starter tripod.,"Bought this for my sister for Christmas. i figured for the price how could i pass it up. i knew it would be cheaply made, but i didn't know how fast it would break. granted she might have been a bit rough. still works just does not raise to the max height. i recommend it to any starter photographer or film maker. being one my self it was ok, just dont toss it around."
3,"Good for the price,but too short...","I recieved the tripod a few days ago.It took a little while to figure out but its quite easy to use.I went to do some photography work,and i realized that it really isnt quite that tall,i think its more of 46 inches maybe.I mean it says 53 inches but i was trying to do a self portrait and of course i knew the tripod was going to be too short so i had put a tall box under the tripod even and it was still way too short.Im only 5'.But other than that its a very good tripod for that price.it works great and it is sturdy and easy to use.It didnt come with instructions so make sure to read up on how to use a tripod before messing with it.The mount is great for any digital camera,i bought one from wal mart and it fits perfectly onto the tripod."
2,Decent tripod for stills,"I bought this tripod to use for both still photograpy as well as for my video camera. It works fine for photograpy, but is rather poor for videography. The adjustments are adequate and you can set it to many different angles and positions, however the motion smoothness is terrible. If you are looking for a tripod to set up, press record and forget it, this should do the trick, but do not plan on panning with this tripod. The motion is extremely jerky and you can actually hear a noticable clicking sound when turning from side to side.I would have to believe there are better options out there."
1,"Item does not match description, poorly put together.","I know this is a cheap item so my expectations are aligned with the price. However whatever the price, the item should match the description. The description says ""59"" full size professional tripod for any camera or camcorder"" however at maximum height the tripod is only 51 inches tall. That may not seem like much but it's the difference between recording at head height or chest height.The over all build quality isn't great but it's cheap so I can live with that. But I can't get the camera level which is a deal breaker. To fix this I would have to file away part of the mount to allow it to move to the level.I'm going to return the item it isn't up to my $6 expectations."
1,Complete Garbage,"I used it once, then the head snapped off. The legs were wobbly to begin with, and well, now its completely broken. Not even worth $10. I paid $15. STAY AWAY, far better tripods, for just a little bit more."
1,Not good enough,The 53-Inch Camera Tripod with Bubble Level (Silver) is like a childs toy that you would except not to last very long.If one was to use this tripod in the house only it mybe OK.There is other tripods for a couple of dollars more that are the real thing.4 thumbs DOWN
3,Love Hate Relationship,"Yes, I know that this tripod is cheap. Yes, I know that you pay what you get for but I didn't expect that my 11-month-old would be able to bend one of the legs out of true. I also didn't expect that when trying to get the leg straightened out that I would rip off the bottom section therefore limiting the height that I am able to use the tripod. No, we are not freakishly strong or related to the incredible hulk. I hate this thing but it does work and I am able to get the shots that I need for my food photography."
1,do not buy this!,I bought this item for a photography road trip. Sadly the tripod broke on the second day while I wanted to put it up.
1,Arrived Broken,53-Inch Camera Tripod with Bubble Level (Silver)Product arrived broken. Two of the clips that hold the legs were broken.
3,so so...,"This product is so so, compares to the one I got years ago and about the same price. I would not recommend it, if you are looking for a slightly higher quality product. It will still work, just not that great looking."
3,This edition uses Americanised English,"C.S. Lewis has written outstanding works, including Surprised by Joy, but the publisher of this edition had the book written in American English, which I found to be a departure from Lewis' style. When I say American English, I mean the word spellings are the American forms. Lewis was not American, and as far as I know, did not write using uniquely American spellings. Good book, but I recommend finding this same title from another publisher that keeps the British English spelling of words."
5,Price matched condition of the book,"The book was a little worn, but it did not bother me because the price was so low. I found learning about the life of C.S. Lewis, who is a great leader in my eyes, was enlightening."
3,Not Lewis at his Best,"Do not expect to find here the profound insights of ""Mere Christianity"" nor the moving remarks of ""A Grief Observed."" ""Surprised by Joy"" is a good account of C.S. Lewis's travel to believing in God. The style, though, is less vigorous than that of other works, and during the first chapters there is a sense of subjectivism and not knowing why the author is discussing some details about his life. Chapters such as those related to Lewis' years in public and boarding schools are hard to understand, unless you have lived in England and are acquainted with the educational system there."
2,Deceptive item condition,"The item i ordered was said to be in ""good"" condition, but describing the item i received as ""acceptable"" would be very generous. The book i received had stained and folded pages with some writing inside. The cover looks like it has taken significant damage over the years as well. Be wary of anything you buy from -Books in the Balance-"
5,Don't even hesitate,"This book features like 40 paintings of Dave Hartman and lots of doodles which are helpful for the aspiring painters. If you are into zombies, monsters and such this bok is the right choice for you!After reading the book you'll understand that Dave Hartman is a kick a** artist!"
1,Superwoman,"This was the last Kay Scarpetta mystery I've read. Scarpetta as superwoman and the outlandish, totally implausible ending were the reasons I stopped reading Cornwell's books. After this one, I decided that, with Kay Scarpetta around, who needs a department of law enforcement, or even a criminal justice system? She can singlehandedly gather any evidence at any crimescene, process it, and catch, try, and convict the perpetrators (I may be wrong, but I believe she also has a law degree to go with her medical degree.) Then, at midnight, after a full day of crimefighting, she can whip up a full, multi-course Italian meal from scratch - probably with homemade pasta and produce from her own garden! The early books were great, but, as I said, I won't read another one!"
4,KAY IS LOSING IT AND THIS BOOK JUST PROVES IM RIGHT.,I like patricia cornwell's novels. Ive read all of them and the first couple are good but in recent years kay as gone from medical examiner for virginia and aunt to super woman. This book isint all bad there are moments of taught suspense and some very gruesome details. Marino and lucy are the only credible characters. Lucy espicially. Miss cornwell here's a tip try a book without kay but still with lucy.
2,Eh.,"Normally I like this author's stuff, but this was not one of her better efforts. Maybe next time."
2,dissapointing,"I was very dissapointed in this book. I generally feel that Cornwell writes resonably well with a plot that provides enough twists and turns to keep things interesting for a entertaining read. There was no tense build-up to a surprising or exciting ending, which is what I want in a crime novel. Her writing is generally not bad, but her editor must have been asleep for this one. I don't require perfect writing from the authors I read, but in this book, there were enough instances of awkward sentences and bad grammar that it became distracting. In addition, her characters are becoming thin and tiresome. Elizabeth George is an example of a mystery writer whose characters actually grow from book to book and when I pick up a new book of hers, I'm interested in what will become of the characters next. Ms. Cornwell's characters have become way too predictable and one-dimensional."
3,Just doesn't seem quite right...,"Dr. Kay Scarpetto seeks the answer to the death of a close aquantaince.But the answers are not easy, our doctor scuba dives and does some footworkon her own in this story. But this book starts to pull you in and you get to knowthe characters, then it drops off and you lose the suspence. Seems thatPatricia Cornwell struggled to come up with this part of the book and in thestruggle lost. The book ends as well as it started. I would never tell you not toread this author, but there is no need to rush. And Pat if you read this we don'twant you to rush either, we love your books, and the wait is worth it."
1,Don't waste your money,"This isn't one of Cornwell's better Scarpetta mysteries. The plot takes a sharp turn three-quarters of the way through into the realm of the truly unbelievable, and I lost interest. I finished the book only because I had nothing else to read in the house.Don't bother buying this book. Fortunately, I got it for free, so no great loss there.Oh, and I agree with one of the other reviewers -- the dialogue coming out of Scarpetta's mouth was stilted. And the ending? Blech."
2,"Love Scarpetta, but this was disappointing","I have been sucked into the Scarpetta series with a passion. I've furiously burned through all of the books before this one. I really wanted to like Cause of Death, but there were several problems.1. It started out really well, with all of the suspense and mystery that the rest of the books had. However, that fizzled out toward the middle of the book.2. The plot was all over the place as if Cornwell didn't know who or what to focus on. It just never made sense.3. This is the first time Scarpetta has been after terrorists and I didn't buy it or enjoy it. I don't read murder mysteries to read about terrorism.4. The traits of the great characters: Lucy, Marino, Wesley and Scarpetta herself seemed stifled and boring. There was no life to it.Overall, this is the worst book of the series so far and I actually found myself skipping pages just to get through it, which is normally a big no-no to me."
2,Not nearly as good as Patricia Cornwell's previous books.,"I was eagerly waiting for the release of ""Cause Of Death"". I am captivated by Patricia Cornwell's writing, however this book was no match for her previous. I think she did a wonderful job on ""From Potter's Field"" and that book held my attention, and gave me chills all the way through. I can usually finish a Cornwell book in a weekend, this one took me a couple of weeks. Not an easy book to get into. I look forward to reading more of her books, and can't wait until she writes another"
1,Cause of Death? Complete and Utter BOREDOM,"To quote from the book...""Don't talk to me in riddles,I'm not in the mood."" With many tedious abbreviations like the following it's easy to see why - FEMA,HRT,MCV,RV,IV,SEALS,UVA,CD-ROM,DOS,FBI,ERF,CRT,CNN,CAIN,BC,CPTL ETC. This is definitly the final PC book I shall read.PLEDGE."
2,Goodbye Cornwell!!,"It seems Patricia Cornwell might be writing her books with Hollywood in mind -how else to explain the silly, 'boys own' chase through the nuclear reactor? It starts off well enough with the usual Scarpetta/Marino ambience but becomes a completely different book by three quarter time (hello Wilbur Smith). Even though I've read every other Scarpetta novel, I couldn't even be bothered to read the last chapter. I feel like I've lost something interesting in my life that aint gonna come back"
1,Disappointing,"The title of the book is misleading and the book is disappointing. It it the other way round. If you want to find out the tricks of using Inventor or to discover the ""tops"" of Inventor, don't buy this book. It is simply of replica of the help menu found from the application"
5,Couldn't stop reading!,"All of these stories were great! I'm glad I bought the bound collection so I didn't have to stop reading at the end of each story. You really get to know the characters and their personalities throughout the series and are eager to find out what will happen between them next. Texas! Sage was by far my FAVORITE, then Texas! Lucky. Texas! Chase wasn't as gripping, but still very good. I plan to read them all again, and maybe again..."
2,not the same joey,"the only reason i give this show two stars is because of its star matt leblanc. as far as the show goes, i give it zero stars. this show had big potential not just because of matt, but because it had the same writers and producers as friends. i guess they all lost heart. yes it would have been nice to bring the friends gang on the show to guest star, but if this show was what it should have been which is well plotted and produced, they wouldnt need them. they should have have kept joey in new york, had him get a new roommate, and kept some of his same story lines as they had in friends. instead they completely changed his life. i could go on and on but i think you get my drift. if your just a huge friends fan then youll probably want this dvd, but if your just looking for good entertainment then this is not the way to go. im a huge friends fan but this is a completely different joey."
1,JOEY sucks.,"Honestly, why would anyone buy this piece of crap? JOEY is not funny, and it definitely compare to FRIENDS.It just proves, in my opinion, that JOEY may have been great in an ensemble sitcom like FRIENDS, but by himself it just doesn't work.Save your money and buy a FRIENDS DVD."
4,"Don't compare it to Friends, it's different, but great!","If you go into Joey expecting the same Friends feeling, you ain't gonna get it, a la Frazier from Cheers.However, Joey holds it's own (or rather it did before the jerks cancelled it) and is WELL worth buying. Hilarious stuff, quirky and fun supporting cast."
5,korn-issues,"issues is korn's best cd yet. they have every type of music that they have played in the past, from the slower more electronics and instruments to the fast loud moshpit stuff. the only let down to this album is that they didn't have any guest singers, which on the other cd's were the best songs. But, jonathan does a lot of the drums on this cd and it adds a lot to the songs. overall this is by far my favorite cd I own."
1,Not a Chance,"This new album is a disappointment. By the end of it, the same old riffs and tone get somewhat tiresome.Any band (Korn, Metallica) that has to issue a ""clean version"" alongside its ""explicit lyrics"" version just needs to go away. And why do record companies force the public to pay a premium for the clean version?"
5,ESTA POCA MADRE!,"EN ESTE DISCO SE REFLEJA QUE KoRn HA MADURADO DEMASIADO COMO BANDA DE HARD CORE Y SUENA BASTANTE CHIDO. Y LO QUE HICIERON CON EL VIDEO DE ""FALLIN AWAY FROM ME"" ES GENIAL."
4,It works!!!,"For this price, You cannot beat it! I think it sounds pretty clear and for this price, It's the best mic. BUY THIS BEFORE IT GOES OUT OF STOCK! Make sure you plug in BOTH plugs, green and pink or it will not work, also Make sure you talk pretty close to the mic, almost touching the mic. My friends find it sounds better when the foam is off the mic. BUY TODAY!"
4,The Extras are Cool,"This public domain title gets very little respect. Yes its cheesy but it has a weird charm. The transfer for blu-ray is good but not great. The right side of the picture flashes off and on. I think the credit sequence should be scraped for any future release. The sequence could be easily remade using the same graphics. The print here is very scratchy however the picture improves as the film goes along. What is sad is that for very little money the transfer could of been improved. Anybody with a good computer program could easily digitally fix the scratches.Now the extras are a hoot. They are Christmas/Holiday Related and are a time capsule that will bring a smile to every ""Grinch and Scrooge""I hope one day someone will foot the bill for a restoration of this film, This film still holds a soft spot in the hearts of millions who grew up watching this on annual television showings. This was years before cable tv, vcrs, and dvrs."
1,8th day of christmas review,"For the 8th day of christmas I'm going to review...Santa Claus Conquers the Martians. The only good thing about this film is the Santa Claus played by John Call. The rest stink. The story is almost as dumb as the one from Avatar. If not more so. The Martians don't even look like Martians,they look like Gumby rejects. The Robot looks like it was made by a drunk 4-year-old. The effects are soo bad,it makes the effects in Superman 4 look like the effects in The Dark Knight. The acting is third-rate. The worst part is the laughing Santa scene. It's just soo creepy like Beetlejuice. The settings are childish. Overall,it stinks like 3-year-old-pizza. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."
3,Bag this Backpack,"The JanSport Air Cisco, while a nice-looking and comfortable sling pack, is entirely impractical for student use. We were unable to zip the pack closed once we'd put a standard 3-inch binder and a math textbook inside. If the only cargo you're interested in packing is a CD player, lunch, and a few file folders, this may be the pack for you. The strap is well-padded and adjustable, the color is sharp and stylish, and there are some nifty pockets. But the triangular shape of the main compartment prevents practical storage. Students: Bag this backpack!"
2,Queer Old Music,"This music isn't really all that great, it's weird. There are way better Dance albums out there. This isn't one of them."
4,All you can ask for $$$,"This is an excellent home laser printer. Price is right, output quality & speed is good enough, and it is easy to set up. It is small, quiet, and inoffensive. If you print alot of text you will save money long term buying a laser and just add on an inexpensive color inkjet for photos. Overall, I love the printer, but Samsung's customer service is not up to par."
2,Paper feeder stopped working ...,I have the same problem as the people above said. The paper feeder stopped working after less than 3 years. Guess it's a common problem for this model. Which you won't know until 2-3 years later.
2,Beware,"The Samsung ML-1210 prints ok...when it prints. An error message kept coming up saying I was out of paper. What a hassle. Spend more and get better quality. Their service phone line kept me on hold and then cut off the call. I tried again and was on hold for an hour only to be told ""goodbye."" Their web site is primitive and hard to navigate using email with messages disappearing off the screen. And can they get someone to write in ENGLISH on their Website?????"
4,"Great printer, just needs some maintenance","I have had the same problem after printing around 4000 pages, the rubber paper feed stopped working. After a Google search, I was able to solve the problem on my own. (...)All in all, the printer just needs a cleaning after awhile and now my paper feed works perfectly. Printer is great for text but could be better on graphics. For the price I originally paid, it is a great printer."
5,My pick for home laser printer,"I've been using the ML1210 for quite some time, some 700 sheets later no problems to report yet (that's 700 sheets on the toner cartridge that came with it). I keep the toner saver on all the time or a quick press of a clearly lit button turns it off as needed. For 10pt or larger text hard to tell the difference. It hadles thick rough paper, good copier, and labels all well. Though the bypass feed for envelopes does tend to make them go sideways a bit. If you MUST constantly swap paper and envelopes it not the best pick. If USB connected and printing out simple documents it really does keep up with 10-12 pages a minute. The lights on front are clear, setup is a breeze. One nice point, a new catridge give a NEW drum and toner. It's a rock bottom price printer I'd recommend if you just need laser printing."
5,A great little laser printer,"Even though my ink jet printer at home could print in color,I usually enjoyed printing on the laser printer at work more,because it was faster and the text sharper. The laser wasalso cheaper per page, though my employer pays for that.Now I've got my own little laser printer -- and I love it.It's cheaper, faster and sharper. Some old reams of paperthat were starting to jam on my other ink jet printer runthrough this Laser Printer just fine (I'm a real penny pincher).The top feed and top exit let me use it in a confined space.Or there's front exit, at the slide of a little door. All thelittle details and mechanicals work fine.And it works fine with all three of my systems: Win98, WinXP andLinux (Mandrake 8.0, presently).So far, no complaints."
4,compelling for a kangeroo trial,"The writers do a great job in presenting clear evidence as to why the trial of Jesus Christ was a complete travesty and injustice. Dwawing upon the Old Testament, Jewish authoratative writings and the Sanhedrin's own legal proceedings, they show how the trial of Jesus should have been thrown out of court many time over. This book is a must for any serious student of trial evidence, especially how it relates to the gospel accounts of Jesus."
1,This book is extremely useless,"We bought this book in summer 2002 for our trip down the ICW that fall. We bought it based on the fact it was a ""Fourth Edition"" ! It is SO out of date it is not funny, and in fact could be dangerous to rely on it, or at least an inconvenience. It might be somewhat useful if they updated it. After using Skipper Bob's Anchorages book, and his Marina guide, (which combined, cost less than the Moeller book) I would say these are the bible of ICW travel. They provide mile by mile anchorage info and rankings, and marina info such as types of fuel, price, slip prices, etc. VERY USEFUL and up to date info. They are updated every year, with changes to anchoranges/marina info submitted by the author, as well as the readers."
4,mi posse es su posse !!,"back in the Day!ronnie,at his best but no airplay, classic,i liked it very much,but 'Every Generation', ""says it all"" as does,all his "" Friends and Strangers"". definetly a collectors dream."
4,"Functional, good bang for your buck","I'm living on campus this fall, and I needed something convenient to carry the copious amounts of stuff I use in the shower. I'm pleased to say that this caddy is nice and roomy, so it holds my big bottles of shampoo and conditioner, Dr. Bronner's soap, face cleanser, bar soap, wash cloth, razor, comb, shower puff, and foot scrubber. However, the appearance wasn't what I was expecting. The picture shows a light gray caddy, but the one they sent me is an ugly lime green. I don't particularly care what it looks like as long as it's functional, but I definitely wouldn't have chosen that color."
3,not what i expected,"This shower caddy works fine, but I got it because I thought the bottom was mesh like the sides. Instead it only has a small hole in the bottom for drainage. Otherwise it's just fine."
5,Its about time!,"I am so happy to see this wonderful film finally make it to dvd! ""Petulia"" is such a rich, poignant, mesmerizing film. I have watched it many times on tv and it never fails to cast a spell on me. Like many other people have remarked, you must see it more than once to get the full depth of it, due to the innovative editing and time line manipulation. George C. Scott is at his all-time best and Julie Christie is stupendous. I would have rather seen her win an Oscar for her haunting performance here than for ""Darling"", but of course the Academy did not even nominate her, in their infinite wisdom (or Scott either). Now if only they would go ahead and put out ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" and ""The Go-Between"" on dvd, I would truly be a happy camper!"
2,This band is way overrated,"Ok.. They've got some degree of talent but there's 2 types of talent when it comes to music; Song-writing and playing. These guys only seem to have the later since they can't bring it together consistantly enough. Everyone raves about this singer and he's got good vocal range but horrible technique. He scoops nearly every note he sings and sounds like he's singing through his nose. Just pure crap.Helloween at least did some justice w/ ""funny"" songs but Edguy's attempts to be funny come off as crude, silly, and infantile. ""Lucifer in Love"" is just stupidity at it's finest. ""Lavatory Love Machine""??? Y'ok Edguy... You guys are cool! Riiiiight! Sorry... There's better metal in this genre to support. You don't need to buy every garbage can of notes that's released."
3,Edguy's best? Then Edguy=not worth my $$,"What first strikes me about this album is that edguy is trying waaay too hard to be a classic metal band. Honestly it's out of control here and i find it almost unlistenable. Not because its bad, but because its incredibly generic and other bands do it much better. This album is a wannabe operation mindcrime except much less enjoyable. The lead singer (i'm not going to waste my time seeing who it is) tries ridiculously hard to be dickinson or tate. I feel like i've wasted money hearing something that sounds like everything on the classic rock station my mom listens to. In contrast to such gleaming reviews, nothing special here folks. Look elsewhere for your metal."
3,"Funny, but not funny enough","I was ready for Bender's Game to be over about 40 to 45 minutes in. There just isn't enough comedy, certainly not enough laugh out loud comedy, in the DVD for me. The production value of Bender's Game is great as the film looks and sounds wonderful. But looks and sound just aren't enough to carry a Futurama movie 80+ minutes without substantial jokes.Overall, Bender's Game isn't something that I'll need to watch again. Mind you, I'm not saying it was bad, rather that it is more forgettable and didn't grab my attention like the first movie did."
4,Closer to the TV series than the last one,"If you like Futurama and Lord of the Rings, you will probably like the latest movie. Much better than the previous one (beast with a million backs) and closer to irreverent humor and weird plot tangents seen in the original series. Looking forward to the next movie."
2,Nuking the Fridge,"If there was ever an example of ""Nuking the Fridge"" or ""Jumping the Shark"" this would be it. I am sitting around enjoying this movie then they decide to dump all the characters into a Lord of the Rings spoof with a paper thin explanation. Last time I checked, this was a Science Fiction series. The worst part is the first 20 minutes of the show is probably some of the best pacing and writing out of the 3 DVD releases so far. If you watched the first 20 minutes of this movie then skipped to the last 5 minutes to complete the storyline; it would probably be one of the best episodes of Futurama. Instead, we are stuck with a Lord of the Rings parody that no one asked for or wanted to see."
3,amazon shipping boooooo,my copy arrived smashed up so boo to amazon shipping. .. .. .. .but the movie was ok. i have never played Dungeons and dragons.. so maybe if i did i would of enjoyed it more.. i am the hugest futurama fan so to give this less then 4 stars hurts....i think this movie was thrown together a little to fast and the writing wasnt as good as the series.hopefully the next one will be better
5,The unmistakable stench of dwarf urine!,"The first two Futurama movies were ok (well, to be honest, Beast with a Billion Backs was terrible), but this third installment is a winner. It has all the sly humor from the classic Futurama seasons that you've missed, and then some. I enjoyed the greater inclusion of Dr. Zoidberg.The premise is quite true to life; the Planet Express crew must deal with the increase in dark matter fuel prices. This somehow segues into a Lord of the Rings plot which I won't spoil, but it actually works out quite well. We have an interesting tie-in between Mom and Professor Farnsworth.All the old favorite characters are here too, including Morbo the Annihilator, Nibbler, Sal, Scruffy the Janitor, and George Takei. I didn't see Zapp Brannigan or Kif, but they weren't missed, and would've detracted from the story, or rather, the semblance of a story.In conclusion, I think it's the unmistakable stench of dwarf urine that makes this Futurama movie a winner!"
4,All three movies,"I have casually watched the series in the past. Recently, I casually watched a few reruns and started really getting into Futurama. I saw some of Bender's Big Score on TV and then watched the whole movie on DVD.Of the three, I loved BBS the best. There were a lot of funny jokes and I love how they complexly interwove time travel into the movie. Couldn't watch the whole Hypnotoad episode. Zzzzzz. 5 stars.The Beast of a Billion Backs was an interesting story but I personally didn't think it was that funny. 3 and half stars.Bender's Game was funnier than BBB but I'm not crazy about parodies because if you've missed the parodied movie.... In this case, it was the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy. 4 stars.Still, I am great fan and will purchase the 4 season episodes."
3,Paranoid,Just ok.I am a HUGE Sabbath Fan and Found This a Little Bit Borning.It was Nice to Hear the Boys Talking About the Record and Hear The Tracks Broke Down and isolated but there was no new classic footage of any kind etc..............Just thought it could have been better.Rent Dont Buy.
4,Fun vacation read,I really enjoyed reading this book. It took me back to Nancy Drew and other mysteries of my adolesence. It was enjoyable by the pool on my recent vacation.
1,low visibility,"Because I didn't quite believe other reviews about the inability to see the clock face at certain angles (I have a dresser next to my bed, instead of a traditional night table), I figured I'd try this clock-radio that seemed to have all the features I wanted. I have returned it, since it was impossible to see the time from my bed. Next time I'll know better."
3,This book is only an administrative business planner.,This book focuses primarily on the administrative aspect of a photography business. It does go into any in depth photography techniques what so ever. It does not go into any kind of photography equipement to use. The entire book is basically a business plan geared toward the aspect of photography.
4,Present for my photographer son,"I gave the book to my son, a recent college graduate, who really likes it."
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, Block lives in a ""what if"" fantasy. Politics is a ""real world"" subject."
4,What do you say about a wall bracket?,"I purchased this wall bracket for my Flowtron bug light. It is durable. It provides theft security by means of a screw/bolt that prevents removal without removing the screw. It is also nice in that if it is windy, it keeps the light from falling off of the bracket."
2,Not great,"This timer is generally 30 sec to 1 minute off from the time I wanted- which can make a big difference when broiling, for example. Another complaint is the ringer rings for a set amount of time (like 10 seconds?), and you can't get it to stop until it's wants to! Very irritating when the baby falls asleep and I try to turn the timer off, but it has to sit there and alarm (for what seems like forever when holding a sleeping baby!) and wake him up! But I give it 2 stars because it feels substantial, not cheap, and it's way better than the Polder one!"
3,Worth the trip,"Novel hasn't the power of THE GLASS CELL or STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. A little too cute perhaps, but the story never falters for long. Does become a little tiresome due to over-explanatory passages and grocery lists of questions Sudney and Alicia are in habit of asking themselves. Lighter fare certainly than THE TREMOR OF FORGERY or THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY, both frought with the kind of angst-producing state Highsmith is master at evoking in a reader."
2,patchy,It's ok- hasta manana is brilliant. But 'suzy hang around' has some very off ey singing. 'Waterloo' was never great in my book and 'the king kong song' is definitely the worst song ever by ABBA.The gorgeous melodies were yet to arrive.
4,A First,Seventy Times Seven was my first order and read of a gay novel. I could not have selected a better first book. Am looking forward to more reads from the author.
2,An Interesting Study At Best,"I love Christopher Marlowe, and I am happy that this play did not discourage me from reading his ""Dido Queen of Carthage,"" ""Faustus,"" ""Edward II,"" or ""Massacre At Paris."" In my opinion, ""1 Tamburlaine"" and ""2 Tamburlaine"" are interesting studies at best. I feel that too much of Marlowe's genious takes a back seat to bad humour. Furthermore, Tamburlaine himself lacks the malignant charm of Faustus. He also does not play on our sympathy like Edward II. Nor does he have chilling passages like Guise. The only possible reason I would give for reading this is that it was Marlowe's first effort. Also, the bad humour allows us to see the mentally disturbed side of Marlowe. My best advice to anyone who reads this is don't let this discourage you from reading his great works like ""Dido Queen of Carthage,"" ""Faustus,"" ""Massacre At Paris,"" or ""Edwatd II."""
3,Not so great bag though,"I am somewhat disappointed with this bag. The computer compartment is ok. But the bottom camera compartment is too small for a decent DSLR and any accessories. It is difficult to reach and get the camera in and out. You have to put the bag down, open the zip completely and get the camera out. You need to be careful how to position the camera in the bag also since the padding is kind of weak at the bottom too. The top compartment can only fit some clothing or books since it has no padding at all. Maybe it is ok for some day trip in the cities."
4,Almost perfect,"I bought this bag to house my 17"" HP Pavillion laptop, Canon XTi, 3 lenses, a flash and various personal items for my upcoming travels.Everything fits perfectly, even the laptop!There has been some chatter on the reviews on this, that 17"" laptops dont fit. This is true if you don't remove the foam insert from the bottom of the laptop compartment. I was struggling to get my lappy to fit until I realized it was there; once removed, everything fit easily.My only gripes about this bag are the single zipper on the main compartment, and a lack of places on the bag to attach carabiners to. Other than that, it's perfect."
4,"fantastic price, quality product","I've to carry both my camera and notebook around everyday, so this product is perfect. Has ample room for my bulky 15"" widescreen dell and my canon rebel xti with two extra lenses.The only issue I have with the bag is that the straps tend to shift up and down a little, so you'd have to readjust every time you put it on, which annoys me a little.Other than that, it's a worthwhile purchase and I'm plenty pleased with it."
5,Deborah shines on this album!,"Deborah's ability to write lyrically satisfying ballads is the main reason why I love this album. ""You Don't Have to See"" is written well and her voice is perfect for the story unfolding in your mind. A person who loves someone and won't allow others to discourage them. ""Think with Your Heart"" is also one of my favorites on the CD. If you enjoy Deborah's ballads then you won't be disappointed. Her writing style has never been matched or surpassed in my music collection and I personally think this is her best album."
2,Good concept but very poorly done,"The plot has so much potential, it's a pity they ended up producing such a dull movie. Really the only things that kept me watching it was the hope that it would get better (hope springs eternal) and the fact that I have found so many times in the past that what starts out as a dull, slow-paced movie often ends up to be a gem. This is NOT the case with this movie. Only for a few minutes in the movie does it pick up beyond a snail's pace. It's difficult to sympathize with any of the characters when the overall feeling they give you is one of annoyance. I hope you have better luck with this movie than I did."
4,Whiskey a Go Go,"I love Johnny Rivers, I was at the club back in the sixites when he performed many of these hits. The first half of the CD I thought was great. It brought back so many memories of the music that night when it was live. Towards the end of the Cd I didn't care for some of the songs. But in all I still think it's a good CD of his music to listen to."
4,tailgate protector,The item arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. It installed very easily and was able to cut to fit. Was concerned there was no hardware to affix to tailgate but so far so good.
5,An emotional and energetic masterpiece,"I first saw John Hiatt play ""Sessions"" on PBS. After watching him play live I went online to see what albums he had. I selected this album because it had ""Cry Love"", a song I remembered from the show. Not only is almost every song a classic, it is a very emotional album. Although some songs may follow a dark theme, many about love lost, it is very energetic. The mix of electric/acoustic elements and the gritty, almost country feel of the album makes this one you will want to listen to over and over. I would give it 5+ stars if I could. I highly recommend this album."
2,A surprise and disappointment,I read the reviews of this book on Amazon and ordered it. I was surprised that there was so much anti-abortion moralizing and born again Christian diaglogue. I expected more of a mystery-thriller. I found the writing to be simplistic and was generally disappointed in the book.
3,Adorable,These look as cute as can be on our Chihuahua... but she hates them. I think it is because her eyes are bulbous and it is almost impossible to adjust the nose pads enough to keep them from poking her in the eyes.
4,Does the job,The replacement bulb is not as bright as the original but it does the job of zapping the bugs.
3,This is for the bulbs in general,"My original lasted a few months and I had to get a replacement. So far this one has held up good but I am concerned at how long it will last. Time will tell but for the price, they should last for more then just a couple months."
1,unsatisfied,"I purchased the Flowtron BF-190 Replacement bulb on May 12, 2012. It must have been defective because it burned out after 1 month.The original bulb lasted for years. Anna S. Hurst"
2,as cheap as it is,"To prevent the mirror from vibrating, I had to put a lot of foam around and in behind. I wouldn't buy it a second time. Pay more and go for the real stuff!"
5,A Writer's Model; A Reader's Dream,"Ms. Waters has created a novel that is a curiously satisfying mixture of Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, and Toni Morrison. The narrative style and empathetic female characters are of Bronte; the description and carefully drawn settings and character names are truly Dickensian; and the craftwork of the plot and language are reminiscent of Morrison. The story's framework, told by the journals of both Selina and Margaret, is skillful and well-suited to the plot. I felt immersed in the life of Millbank and the inner turmoil of Margaret. As soon as I finished this book, I recommended it to friends and began to read it again, looking for subtle clues and shadings that were adeptly woven into the story, leading to its conclusion. This book was, without a doubt, the best current fiction I have read in quite some time."
5,Unbelievable,"When I first started reading, I wasn't sure how I would enjoy it. The progression was a little slow at first; but the by the middle, I was completely captivated in Waters' world. The foreshadowing is placed so excellently, and the characters so real, as to make the book quite wonderful. The ending actually made me cry; which I never do. I still don't know whether I want to scream at it or just cry more."
3,hated it...,"Will admit I was entranced by the book - although a bit slow-moving - until the ending...which was absolutely horrible! Left me depressed for days, and who the Hell needs that?! God knows, we get enough nasty betrayals in real life without getting blasted with it in a book whose ending seemed, until the last 20pages, to promise what would have been a satisfying closure on so many levels. I don't know if I have the emotional fortitude to read another of Ms. Waters' books..."
4,Another winner from Sarah Waters,Well worth the read -- interesting story line with surprise ending. I am a new Sarah Waters' fan!
4,Hauntingly good,"After being entirely pleased with TIPPING THE VELVET, I was eager to read Affinity. Waters widened my scope of appreciation for stories like Affinity because although it evoked immense sadness and haunting disappointment, I found myself enamored with, and awed by its delivery. I was compelled to know more about its heart, and read into the late, late hours of night, which hasn't happened in a long time."
3,It's no Fingersmith,"I read this book on the strength of Fingersmith, and was disappointed. It takes FOREVER to really get into - and while the end is very good and ties everything together, I'm not sure it was worth the wade required."
4,A Tale Reminiscent of Classic Gothic Literature,"Water's tale of a lonely London spinster and a mysterious spirit medium is a beautiful, compelling visit into a dark yet mesmerizing world of ghosts, lovers, and avid believers in the afterlife. Her vivid descriptions--from a dank women's prison to a proper Victorian home--are rich in sensory details and poetic prose. The story is reminiscent of gothic tales of the past, slowly, carefully reeling the reader inside an engrossing and ultimately tragic plot that would have made the Bronte sisters proud. As a historical fiction writer and amateur researcher of 19th- and 20th-century mediums, I commend Waters on her ability to weave a captivating mystery out of the once-fashionable trend of seances and spiritualism."
3,Affinity,"Margaret Prior is a lady visitor to the grim Millbank Prison - her role is to encourage the inmates to reflect on their misdeeds. But her encounters with the spiritualist Selina Dawes, convicted of fraud and assault, turn into something more, dot dot dot. This is Sarah Waters so of course we have the two vital elements: lesbianism and Victorianism. She writes beautifully and atmospherically, although I think this suffers from being all in first person - she's not too good at differentiating voices, and it's so limiting in terms of what she tries to achieve in plot and suspense. I enjoyed this mostly until the final sections, partly because the plot becomes rather contrived, and partly because it's so depressing."
2,Great Expectations Unmet,"I had great expectations for Waters' latest novel after reading Tipping The Velvet. But unlike ""Velvet"" ""Affinity"" seemed to limp and drag. One reviewer has suggested that the slowness was neccessary for the build up to the final denoument.I was disappointed that Waters let so much ride on the final chapter,it reminded me more of a short story which had been stretched to breaking point than a novel.I can't help wondering whether this was Waters' first novel only published after her second work's success. It certainly lacked the dimension and character development so wonderful in ""Tipping The Velvet."" While I agree that a novel written by a lesbian does not have to be a lesbian novel I found Waters' coyness with the subject irritating. After waiting so long to read this book I was very disappointed."
3,Ring out those bells tonight,"When one considers that the backing band on this album are the same musicians who performed on the excellent 'Street Hassle' and 'Take No Prisoners' albums, and also, that it was, after all, Lou Reed who was putting pen to paper in preparation for 'The Bells', you would be forgiven for wondering why this recording is lacking in both lyrical and musical creative imagination.At the time, Lou was experimenting with an inherent jazz interest and mixing same with some rather uninspiring rock grooves. This project would have been spurned on by his backing band at the time (Suchorsky, Fogel, etc), who by default, are jazz musicians, (check out The Everyman Band on ECM records). Nevertheless, the songs provided by Reed to the band for working on were somewhat ill-conceived to begin with. Having said that though, 'Stupid Man', 'Families' and the title track itself (an edgy dramatic little epic) are worth listening to."
3,I Wish The Radio Station Music Was Used,"In the movie, there was some great music being played at the lighthouse radio station. It was mostly darker rock music. I can't seem to find out the names of the songs played, and the soundtrack does not seem to contain any of those tunes. Disappointing!"
3,its alright...,"Issues installing into a car that has larger seats (Chevy Impala). Hard to read the controller at night, nothing lights up until a button is pushed. Massage function itself is ok, though a kneading function wouldve been nice."
5,Works well in the car,This product came on time (even earlier than stated) and works well in the car for those long or short trips. Can't really feel the heat with a winter jacket on but that is minor. Each massage button does the trick for my problems with sciatica and herniated discs. I just leave mine in the car as I have one in my home already. Highly recommend this product.
4,"More motors, less price","I had just bought a chair cushion and saw this one for a lower price with more motors so I returned the one I bought and this one came just a couple of days later,so I didn't have to wait long for it.When I first used it I was quite surprised at the relief I got and the warm spots were just where I needed them!"
1,should have listened to the reviews,Not very happy with this item. Used it once and put it back in the box. I should have listened to the reviews.
1,Had for 41 days,"Bought this 41 days ago, I should have returned it earlier as the returns were only good for 30 days. Some of the buttons on the controls don't work anymore. So, I can no longer change the timer, the speed or the intensity of the pad. So, every 9 minutes I have to turn it on and change the rest of the settings. It's really annoying."
2,not so good,"I have had it about 3 weeks the straps broke, the controls stick,and the power stays on untill you unplug it.Not as good as the old one which lasted about 12 yrs."
2,"Not much heat, if any","I was very disappointed with this item. The various vibration points seem to be effective, but the hand-held controller is not very user friendly: it's just clumsy the way the buttons are set up. The size of the entire cushion is a bit on the small size and it really does not reach the neck and misses key parts of the back. Finally, and worse of all, is the small heat pad surface (only about 6x10 in) with the unexpected and very disappointing feature that the heating is pressure activated. While I would expect that meant that one has to sit against the pad to draw some localized heat, I could never feel any heat coming from the pad (with the controller asking for heat). While the price is good, the performance and its not meeting my expectations led me to return the item immediately."
1,Battery Replacment is very expensive,"Battery replacement is crazy, after 3 years I had to send it in to Movado and the replacement for the battery is $204 dlls. I paid $227 which was a great deal, so I'm almost paying for another watch just to replace the battery. Don't get me wrong the watch looks great, it isn't as big as mosth watches and since I have small wrists this is perfect for me. But the Battery Replacment is very expensive"
5,Great Watch,"I bought this watch as a gift, and he loved it. I was worried when I read other reviews that said that it is too small for a man(he is a very tall one) but it looks great. It is not like those oversized watches that are popular these days, but for someone who is looking for a classic look, it is great."
2,too dainty for a man,This was bought as a gift for a male friend and I returned it to them because it was much too dainty for a man. It is a beautiful watch and I think it would make a great gift for a woman too.
4,great looking watch just alittle small,the watch looks amazing but size wise it is alittle small. The size actually seems to work out well though for business casual its not to much for a nice shirt and kakis like some of the watchs some people try to wear. My advice to anyone purchasing this watch just look closely at the size comparison pictures and make sure its right for you.
5,Another British gem.,"A Midwinter's taleOne of those little gems that the British film industry produces from time to time.A black and white film about a group of 'resting' actors who rehearse and stage a no-budget production of Hamlet in a gloomy abandoned church, over Christmas.Doesn't sound promising, but the result is a gently humorous film about the parts actors (and people) play. The interaction between the characters, on and off the stage, is a delight to watch.Richard Briers is excellent, as always, playing Polonius in a somewhat eccentric prequel to his performance in Branagh's Hamlet. There's a sly dig at Hollywood, too, with Jennifer Saunders playing a wonderfully bovine Hollywood producer, and Joan Collins playing a glossy theatrical agent.Altogether a splendid little film."
3,Good but didn't have all that was needed,I purchased this book in the hopes that I could find back roads to navigate quicker ways to my destinations. It wasn't as detailed as I had hoped but it was sent in a timely fashion....
4,Useful Road atlas,Great Atlas. A must for those who still like to know where they are going the old fashioned way - maps.
5,i still love these songs,"this recording was labeled a ""sellout"" when it was released--some things never change. if catchy tunes imbued with that great 80's synth sound and velvety vocals are a ""sellout,"" then so be it! i found, and still find, this to be a great collection of songs--well-crafted, full of atmosphere, drum and synth heavy tunes that stick around, begging to be played and played again. glenn gregory has an incredible voice that brings a smooth, sophisticated vibe to the party. i still enjoy every song on here! if you long for the 80's AND sophistication (yes, it is possible) then check this one out."
3,Its ok,I thought this book was OK. It is a large book but doesn't contain many specifics to volleyball. There are a lot of good general sports principles but when it come to actual drills and plays this book is slightly lacking.
4,One of Henty's best!,"The story takes place during time period of the War of the Roses in England. The House of York and The House of Lancaster were clashing for power. Gervais, the main character, leaves England during that time to become a knight of the White Cross and defend the fortress of Rhodes from the Turks. Great insight into the knights and what their functions were during that time period and the causes which they fight for! Gervais is a very engaging character and represents the best characteristics of a knight - a man of honesty, integrity and bravery. He is a ""good man"" worth cheering for to the end of the story!"
2,Disappointing,"The description of this massager is a bit misleading.The 6 motors in the back portion cover 6 rather small areas (more like being hit with small mallets than the sides of hands) and the only motion from side to side or up to down refers to the sequence that the motors thump. There is quite a bit of adjustment to the strength and character of the thumps, but I found the effect neither therapeutic nor relaxing, just curious.I could get the kneading to cover the upper part of my neck or the lower part by turning the control knob, but for someone taller or shorter, the coverage would be limited. The speed control for the kneading doesn't really change the speed that much. The neck kneading nodes are made of rather hard plastic, and in my case they seemed too narrow apart (and there is no adjustment for width), so after just a few minutes it was more painful than relaxing. Then it started squeaking intermittently.Within an hour of receiving the massager I decided to return it."
3,Book Has Value,"I'm not entirely certain why people are giving this book 1 star reviews- it's *not* a 5 star book, but in my opinion, it's *not* a 1 star book. I think the books tracks fairly well to the exam (I just sat the XP exam), and if you know the book really well, it *will* help you as you take the test. Believe me, you also have to have hands on with Citrix XP in order to pass."
2,Book Has Some Worth But...,"I passed 220 today. This book has some worth. It follows the Citrix Guidelines as outlined on citrix.com. However, this box is filled with typos. Questions at the end of the chapters have many errors. Portions of chapters seem to be talking about MetaFrame 1.8. Furthermore, there were some questions on the exam mentioning Citrix subsystems, which were nowhere in this book. I used this book and the PDF's from Citrix's web site. This book is good for granular details like how much hard drive space, RAM, and color resolution you need for MF components. If you have never used MF XP, you will not pass with this book. Furthermore, I would seriously check out the Sybex book to compare it with this before purchasing. This is OK as a reference but only if you have the experience with the product to identify all of the typos (and there are lots!)"
2,You won't pass using this book alone!,"I scored only a 68 on the exam using this book. I scored consistently in the 90's on the practice tests from this book, but if only about %60 of the material on the test was actually in the book it makes it hard to get a 72 to pass."
4,Great Improv Primer,This is a great little book for newbies to the improv comedy world. It is easy to use and the games are fun. It gives great ideas on how to use them and is helpful for anyone wanting to take up improv or teach a beginner class.
2,Very Uncomfortable,I bought this for my husband because he drives a lot during the day. He said it is very akward to lean back on and just makes your back hurt more because of the position you have to sit in. I wouldn't recommend it.
4,Heating pad works well - somewhat like Wahl of the past,"After looking in vain for something to replace the brilliantly-designed Wahl heated/massage back pad (no longer made - BUT WHY NOT??), I came across this ""Comfort Products 60-2802"" pad. It works as described. I only wish it had the ""leather"" (simulated) cover the Wahl had. Otherwise, it provides what most other do not: Support. I've bought & eBayed/tag-saled a bunch of others with that useless, annoying ""buzz"" built-in. This buzz is no better, but the pad has the substance for your lower back.(2008) I bought this back in 2005 and have been using it while at the computer. The vibrator is pretty much useless because of its noise, but the lumbar and heat features are great. I was about to buy another and I see that the cushion is now $4 more than I paid, so it's rising in price by over a buck a year. It's still a good deal if the quality is still there."
2,!Ay Caramba!,"Many articles say American comedies don't do well abroad, unlike action films. Comedy is culturally-specific. I can relate now. This work was supposed to be funny, but I just wasn't feeling it.At first, this reminded me of ""Forest Gump"" in that important world events coincided with events for the main character. But really this may be a Spanish ""Amelie."" The visuals, characters, and facial expressions will remind you of that film greatly.The film has an important message that you never know what life is going to throw at you. However, the main character does two things here that are highly unethical. It's not really a laughing matter.This work was hard for me to embrace, though I'm sure the makers had good intentions."
5,Great Witchking!,"This toy is awesome.It has an incredible stabbing action.It's sword is very accurate, but it's Morgul blade.........But,it stills to be a good toy."
2,Large Dog Crates,"The description of the product says LARGE dog crates, but our normal-sized Shelties did not have much more room to stand up in. Their sizing is off. Good sturdy crates, but the sizing is misleading."
4,Not industrial - best for animals under 20 lbs,"I have an assortment of kennels by different manufacturers. Recently, I picked up one of these Petmate kennels. It was my first Petmate purchase and the kennel was a little different than others I had purchased. First, the plastic was thinner and a bit more flexible. As the pets I place in kennels are all under 20 lbs, this is not such a big deal. The kennel can accommodate that weight. One of the biggest differences is that the Petmate kennel uses multiple plastic body fasteners that function as twist screws to hold the kennel halves together. On other kennels I have used, plastic 3-4 inch long latches hold the halves together. The twist screws and the latches are equally sturdy. I like the twist screws because there are more of them and if one falls off, the halves are still combined. I like this carrier. I put two of my cats inside and it works well for taking them to the vet. While the not the sturdiest, it suits my needs.3.5-4 stars"
1,Not for the bedroom!,"We bought this for our master bedroom. Ours had a ""convenient"" testing function -- you could use your TV remote control to ensure the alarm was still operational. Unfortunately, it was pretty easy for us to set off the alarm by mistake using the remote...not so pleasant during late night TV viewing! I'm not sure if the fault was the alarm's or the remote's, but certainly our combination was dreadful."
4,gas leak detector,"It is working fine; it is for the peace of mind to have it, especially when you have kids in and around the kitchen."
1,A lot of false alarms,"I have received a lot of false alarms with this product. The first time the carbon monoxide alarm went off, I had the fire department out here within minutes thinking we had a big problem. They found nothing in the house. Since then, the alarm sounds about 4 times a week, all false alarms. I've moved the placement of the monitor several times as per the instructions, but it still gives a lot of false alarms."
2,Not that great,"I purchased this item locally on clearance. It works, but that is about all I can say for it.Tuning the channels is very difficult. You have to be very nimble to turn the knob just right to get your channel. The reception, even with the antenna cord, is not that great.All that aside the worst part is once you actually get a channel, the speaker is so terrible you can barely hear the station.I would definitely say save your money if you want an actual functioning shower radio. For cuteness it certainly is, but that doesn't do anything for the functionality of the item.I have not had much luck with the ""cheap"" shower radios and will be purchasing a more expensive one in the future to see if it helps."
1,Fire Hazard! Beware!,"When the timer goes off, the oven does NOT shut off! If you are forgetful, it could be four hours before this unit shuts itself off. Plenty of time for it to burn your food, your kitchen or your home. Buyer beware. Major consumer testing agency fails to note this safety flaw."
3,BIG,This toaster takes up a lot of counter space. It seems to be well made but it is bulky. We also have difficulty with toast. The directions on where to place the rack are confusing.
3,Big and questionablle,"Isn't this thing awfully big? ""20.2 x 18.8 x 12.8 inches ; 9 pounds""And the light weight suggests chinzy quality. Must be the plastic one reviewer reported as cracking ...."
4,"great toaster, good oven","This toaster oven works great if a little slow on toasting. Very even browning and consistent. Oven beeps when reaches set degree mark, timer beeps when expired, but oven does not shut off! If it turned itself off I would rate higher. (toaster turns off !!!; why not oven????)"
5,The Definitive work of Educational Psychology,"This is by far the best work of psychology I have read. Although I have been familiar with the works of Vygotsky, Luria and Co. for a long time, Cole takes these ideas to a new level. It is utterly convincing, practical and engaging. The book is structured like a mystery novel. It begins with the author being sent to Liberia to help diagnose the reasons for the failure of the new school system introduced as part of the country's modernisation plans. Each new turn solves one mystery but throws up a new mystery, and we are drawn along with this puzzle - how do people learn? Every teacher should read this book. Compulsory reading!"
5,Great Artist,"This is a great CD! Recently I have been really getting into O'Bryan and I must say that he is awesome. I hope that Capitol Records will one day release his albums on CD. My fav album is ""Be My Lover."" Best wishes O'Bryan!!!"
3,You Have To Wonder,"What the folks at The Right Stuff were smoking when they released 'The Best Of Obryan' 10 years ago. Like most folks, I was shocked to find songs as edited versions, and a few key tracks that were just ignored when there was more than enough space on the CD for inclusion. Well, I had to remaster this CD, and include 'Soul Train's A Comin' & 'Together Always', in addition to the FULL LENGTH versions of 'You & I' & 'I'm Freaky'. The CD NOW clocks in at over 75 minutes!Peace, SD(fr.'Chaka's World')"
3,REALLY A ONE HIT WONDER WITH A TUNE BY STEVIE WONDER!,"I THINK THE BEST SONG HE EVER DID BESIDES...""STILL WATERS""-ORIGINALLY DONE BY STEVIE WONDER.... -""NOW THAT LOVE HAS FOUND IT'S WAY"" WRITTEN W/ AN UNKNOWN ARTIST ""KEVIN FLEMING""... LISTEN TO THE ARRANGEMENT FOR YOUR SELVES.EVERY THING ELSE WAS BUBBLE GUM AND THAT DOES HAVE IT'S MARKET.... ANYWAY IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HEAR FROM THIS ARTIST AGAIN.....HE HAD GOOD CHOPS....HE IS IN THE ARIZONA AREA."
3,"Yeah, this definitely could have been better","O'Bryan was one of my favorite acts as a teen-ager in the '80s. Since none of his four albums have been issued on CD, this is the only thing keeping this compilation from receiving one star. While it's great to hear his songs in some fashion in the digital age, it's certainly disappointing to hear edited versions of some of his hit songs (like ""Lovelite,"" ""You and I"" and ""I'm Freaky"") while songs like ""Is This for Real"" and ""Together Always"" were omitted.While it certainly looks his his albums will never see the light of day again as far as getting the CD treatment, I'm hoping for a better one-disc compilation."
3,Compilation of this CD is kind of lame!!,The compilation could have been done better. Trax are missing that should have been added! Some songs cut 2 short! :-(
4,beautiful CD,"I love the cd very much but I would love to have seen, and heard (Is This For Real)it's a pretty song just like Maria. Hopefully it will become a part of the Best of O'Bryan Cd collection. That song sounds very personal yet nice. O'Bryan has a beautiful voice, I wish he would return to the business. I know he has done back up singing for others But he is really missed a whole lot. Miss you much O'Bryan, God Bless."
4,Good story line,"Always enjoy each of the Roy Grace series as they are all quiet different and yet the underlying Roy Grace character as he evolves and his own life, good compelling series.... PJ is a fine writer.."
3,Bad ending.,"The book was good 3/4 of the way through but if you're looking for a good endind forget it. I'm glad I got it by way of gift card. Again it was good but if your looking for a ending to match no way, buy it used."
5,Must have!,"This is a must have! I've you're considering to explore the music of Pino Daniele, this is the one to start with. It's a great 'unplugged' overview of his music and will give you an idea of his abilities both as a songwriter and a guitarist. This is a good one to start with. After this one you'll probably want the others aswell. I did anyway!"
4,All it needs is a lid,"Picked this item up as a birthday gift for my daughter along with the marker tower. Great selection of colors and added bonus of glitter crayons. I don't know why I'd assumed there was a lid, but looking at the design, they could have so easily made a lid that not only covered, but locked on to the base so we don't have 150-crayon accidents to pick up or make it easier to put away in a drawer without it coloring everything it touches. I love that it makes the colors easier to see and am fighting the urge to arrange it by color after having a rainbow birthday party. Giving it a 4-star durability review as it seems as if the telescoping ability may fail with prolonged or frequent use. I guess we'll see."
2,Crayon Tower,"Despite the Crayola name, this was a very poorly made product. My 6 and 3 year olds are not able to get the tower to open and stay up without help, and even with that if they slightly tap it while putting a crayon away it falls. The cover should have been more then just a throw away plastic piece."
2,Disappointed in the colors....,"I was very disappointed. There were 2, sometimes 3 of the same colors in this. So although we got 150 crayons, they were not 150 DIFFERENT crayons."
5,Perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, I would recommend this item. It arrived as advertised, on time, safely packaged, and I had no issues at all.I would def do business with this company again.Excellent product !! -Jim :-)"
4,My kids love this!,My 2 year old and 6 year old love to color. The tower is a great way to store crayons. My 6 year old loves the sparkle and metallic crayons! The only thing is that the top of the crayons break too easily. But with the sharpener they can still have some stubbies to use. I recommend this for supervised play or else that's a lot of crayons strung around the house!
4,Okay,Agian these cam with some other Items shipped in the same box. other peices were scatterd and the pakageing was torn on one corner. I am using these as a giveaway in an art contest for small children. I had to tape the box backtogeather to make it look somewhat like it was new. Also some of the crayon tip were broken.
1,Title Song Not On CD......Nutz,"This is a strange situation. Humperdinck has a hit single in 1968 which is the title of this CD. It is nutz that this CD carries the same name as the single Through the Eyes Of Love, yet that song does not appear on the CD. The tracks are are same old tracks that appaers on CD after CD."
2,"Support may be great, but very uncomfortable","I bought this for my son who is constantly rolling his ankle. He won't wear it because he says the brace digs into his ankle (despite the padding). He also had difficulty fitting this inside his baseball cleat, so maybe it's good for hightops and court shoes, but not cleats?"
2,Horrible grammar,"I didn't have high hopes for this book, but I don't think a little proofreading would be asking too much..."
1,Spelling Nightmare,"The plot wasn't too bad, but the spelling was awful. Don't books go through an editing process any more?? It was really distracting and ruined the book for me."
5,inhumane,"hmmm... no reviews yet... if you have any pycho-inclinations or punkaproclivities you oughta locate a copy. it will make the world a better place, cure cancer and end silly wars. ok, maybe not all that, but it's damn good, I haven't been able to stop listening to it. this is one of those bands that makes all other sounds obsolete. pace yourself though, they only have three albums."
5,"Loud, arrogant, and utterly catchy, toked-up fun","I stopped dead in my tracks the first time I heard ""Caught By the Fuzz."" It's so different, yet so familiar--an addictive blend of the best hooks, arrangements and early lyrics of the Who, Beatles (""Sofa [of My Lethargy]), and the Rolling Stones (""Sitting Up Straight""), and you have Supergrass. Unadulterated fun at full distortion, by 3 remarkably accomplished musicians. A real revelation."
5,Elton John At His Finest!,"To put it simply, this is a fantastic album. Elton John puts raw enthusiasm into each song. This isn't exactly a 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' album because of the absence of rockish songs but this is the kind of music one can easily get into. A few of my personal favourites from this CD are: 'Turn Out The Lights When You Leave', 'My Elusive Drug' and 'Freaks In Love'.This album is necessary for any Elton John fan."
4,Best album since made in england,"I like elton john when he dips into all different styles of music and he does that very well on this album. Taupin's lyrics are incredible, almost as if elton were talking. I don't think the single should be track 3, i think the single is track 8, ""All that I'm allowed"". I thought track 3 ""Answer in the sky"" is actually one of my least favorites. Track 1 is great, track 2 is good, track 3 not so good. track 4 is boring but well done. track 5 is fantastic and unique. track 6 is could be better. track so is ok. track 8 is and excellent song. And the rest of the album sounds alike. All in all it is much much better than west coast and big pic and probably as good or maybe even a little better then made in england but a little short of the one."
4,Im a new fan so maybe im wrong,"I have only been a fan of Elton John for about a year or so and i only have Goodbye Yellowbrick Road and Dont shoot me I am only the piano player. Which in both i am very pleased. This album is a little awkward to me in Elton's position for it seems he switches a revolution of music genres to country. It is based on a place in Georgia which I am from, but it's odd how he captures the southern comfort. Im not a big fan of country but his is bittersweet something you can listen to. All in all the album is very good the opener is a good resolution song and Porch swing in Tupelo is just odd but in a good way. After they call her the cat the songs are just mediocore, but I mean after 40+ albums I am not exactly dissapointed.Highlights: Weight of the world, Porch Swing in Tupelo, Too many tears, they call her the cat"
2,"wow, I thought I hated his earlier stuff","Never having been a fan of ""Sir John"", I was as shocked as anyone to have his latest recording in my greasy little hands. None the less, what crap. My earlier disdain for Elton's music has blossomed into true hatred. Jejune and derivative? Banal and insipid? Yes!!! Yes!!! He should go back to wearing big sunglasses. [...] I will say Elton John is brilliant on the piano, but he sucks on the organ."
3,Wrong Book,"Bought this by mistake, thought it was a diffewrent one. Will read it sometime in the futre or donate it to local library."
5,MUST READ for GULF WAR HISTORIANS,"The General's War is an excellent account of the planning and implementation of the Gulf War. In short, it shows why the United States is a great nation. One of the main reasons we were so successful was because we DID argue on how to fight this war. Both the Military and Washington worked together to come up w/ the best possible plan. No war is ever conducted perfectly, but the Gulf War comes pretty close. Don't forget...it is the men and women who fought the war that won it, but the planning phases were crucial to putting our soldiers in the position to win. A little luck in some area never hurts as well. The best part of tis book is that it questions specific decisions from the war. This critcal analysis not only brings awareness, but helps our military and polititians plan future military operations.Don't forget to read ""Bravo Two Zero"" about the British SAS in the Gulf. Great book!"
4,The Treacherous Three- top 5 MC group of all time,"""Special K, Sunshine, Kool Moe Dee...on time."" Funny thing I though homie's name was ""Q Mo D."" Anyway, they are the reason why I MC. PEACE. PS. Moe Dee's rhymes on this project, are very good. I also like the LA Sunshine solo record. And, the posse joint..when Big Daddy Kane said in his rhyme...""I ain't fu@#king with that Nigga."" DOPE."
2,"""A sad day for the TRUE-SKOOL"".","This is the T3 at it's worst moment. True Hip-Hop legends, with poor production and cheesey topics. the only decent track in here is the posse cut ""WE WIT' IT!"" feat: Big Daddy Kane, Grand Master Caz, Melle me & Devastating Tito (Fearless Four). The track ""FEEL THE NEW HEART-BEAT"" is nothing but a re-make of their 1981 classic ""FEEL THE HEART-BEAT"". The re-make of this classic record (and any other Rap classic for that matter) sucks! A huge dissapointment for the True-Skool Hip-Hop heads."
1,Bull,"If you want to read a good book, do not read this. All James Bond does in it is walk around Russia wearing Mukluks. The book could have been made a lot better if it had some decent action scenes in it to sustain it, but all it has is a part where James Bond rolls over the bonnet of a car and stuffs up his shoulder, a short gun battle at a chalet in Russia which is hardly worth mentioning and a final skirmish in my home town of Baku, which is at least some violent relief for us. The plot makes no sense, as do some characters that change sides later on in the story. Why? Why?"
3,Scapegoats of the Empire,"Interesting read- the author is not a gifted writer and this shows. But the story itself is worth reading. Interestingly, Amazon sent me an invitation to look at the movie Breaker Morant which is sort of the movie of this book- but they could not ship it to the same address they shipped the book to. Pity."
5,Bug Zapper Light,"This bulb was exactly the one needed and it works great. I priced them at other stores and they were very high priced, Only the bugs have regrets for the purchase.Robert Everett"
1,Broken light bulbs,I received the two light bulbs that I ordered for my backyard bug light zapper. There was no padding in the envelope and both lamps were shattered. Would be better to use a stiff cardboard box. How do I get my money back.
1,Does not work - too cheap,I just received this and plugged it in and nada!. The part that plugs into the wall is not a snug fit or the actual charger has a short in it. I guess there was a reason it was so cheap
1,BROKEN,"I bought this for my son for his DS Lite and after a week, it was no longer charging his DS. Product is garbage."
2,"Faulty Item, But Easily Repaired","First of all, the charger did not work at all after taking it out of the box. I took out the screws, opened the casing, and found that the source of the problem was a loose wire. After gluing the wire back into its proper place, the charger worked perfectly fine.Also of note, the cord is not nearly as long as it appears in the product picture. ""Official"" Nintendo DS Lite chargers have a cord that is 6 or 7 feet long, but the cord on this one is barely 4 feet long."
2,intendo ds wire,It doesn't fit my Ds all the way but im just happy it charges it even tho it doesn't completely fit.
5,Awesome!,"I ordered this Nintendo DS charger on Saturday (October 3) and it was delivered to me today (October 8) so the service was really really fast. And future buyers of this product, don't think that you get what's in the picture, it's even better!!! It's a beautiful black charger and when you plug it in, it lights up red. It looks like a $25 charger, so for this price you will definetely not be disappointed one bit."
3,"Works, but is a knock-off!","NOT AS DISPLAYED! This is not a genuine Nintendo product, it's a cheap-but-functional knock-off. The prongs on the plug do not fold away. It does work, however."
4,Short but works,A little short cord but it works and that's all i need it for. Charges the Nintendo Ds Lite on U.S. outlets
5,Nintendo DS Lite AC Adapter Charger (replacement) NEW,Excellent in ordering and receiving the item from the seller!!!!!!!!!! Came in the mail quickly!!!!!!!! Works great!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Disappointed,The reason why I'm giving this product only one star is because I ordered two chargers for my daughters and only one of them worked! Also the cable is very short and doesn't stretch so far so be cautious when buying!
4,What can I say? it's a charger...,it works and is built like any other charger...now if only someone didn't steal the DS from my 3 year old and this charger was useful :(
1,Don't buy this product,This product craps out with in about 10 charges not worth your money or time this item is awful. It makes no sense to buy this item or once yu should just go to gamestop and buy there over priced stuff because this is not worth anything
3,"Cheap plastic, but as expected","This is essentially what I expected, and what you paid for. It is relatively cheap plastic, and the fold out wall plug doesn't really stay in place, but at least it fits firmly into the wall and actually charges. I guess it's a cheap replacement if you need it. If I have time I'll update this after some extended use with how well it lasts and such.."
4,Wall charger,I ordered this for a friend but did not see it was for the DS lite. So I'm stuck with a charger I cannot use.
5,Live perfection,"This is quite possibly the best live album ever recorded. Raitt is superb, as is the production. The US version, unfortunately, arranges the songs in an order which isn't quite as balanced as the non-US version, but it's still terrific.If you like Bonnie Raitt, this is an absolutely essential album for your collection."
4,Take the negative reviews with a grain of salt,"This is a very, very good movie: intelligent, compelling and very well written, acted and produced. At first I did not understand all the negative and mediocre reviews it got. When I reread them I noticed two things: Many of those reviews complained that it was too much like a filmed play and that so much dialog was hard to keep up with; and many of those same reviews contained numerous spelling and punctuation errors. Those two observations suggest that some of the people who do not like this movie may have trouble with the English language and would probably be happier watching an action movie or a physical comedy than a dialog-heavy character study like this.So I am writing this in case anyone who prefers character to action is considering watching Nine Lives: you may like it very much more than most of the reviews here would lead you to expect. I certainly did."
5,Very Nice,"Got the first set and one was broken. I called Amazon and they complimentary overnighted another one to me. Got the second set and they were fine. Took about 30 minutes to install them. They look absolutely great, and I was really surprised at how well they keep the rain out. I've seen other deflectors that are the stick on type that go outside the window and they look horrible. These are sleek and fit right into the window channels. Highly recommended if you're looking for deflectors."
5,"Funky, funky, funky!",This is must have album for the retro-funk enthusiasts! The Beastie Boys truly show they have skills to pay the bills with this excellent album. This is the perfect CD to play in the background of a party or anywhere you want to lay down the funk! The sound quality is awesome and you're sure to be tappin' your toe and bobbing your head throughout most of the album. What are you waiting for? Get it! Trust me.. it's worth every penny.
5,"Loved it so much, I've bought it three times!","This is the third time I've purchased this album. I can say that about one other album in my life. (Pearl Jam's Ten) This amazing collection of Beastie Boy jams still burns a hole in my CD player. It's the best chill album I've come across. It's great for road trips, or those times at home when you just want some ambient sound while you're tooling around the house. One of the best albums of all time, and to think, it was an import bootleg. It garnered such a cult following, that the Beastie Boys ended up trying to duplicate the effort recently (which falls far short of this one!). Even if you don't like the Beastie Boys, you should check out this album. I once played it for someone who HATES the Beastie Boys, not telling her who this was. Once I saw her tapping her toes and getting into it, I asked her if she knew who this was. When I told her, she looked like I just sneaked up on her and splashed her in the face with ice water."
4,meh. I like it but...,"...I may have gotten a little too excited about buying it. I used to own it and it was lost long ago. Every so often I'll remember it and want it back and, finally, I picked it up. It's nice to have it back but, until I break it out for a party, I'm not apt to listen to it a lot.I do love What it is: the Boys showing skill, talent, and depth even beyond what their most ardent fans would ever give them credit for ... and so, yeah, I guess I'm glad I bought it again."
1,Had to be returned since Seasons 1-3 were defective,"I eagerly purchased both sets of Seasons 1-3 along with Season 4. Seasons 1-3 were extremely glitchy and un-watchable. I returned both DVD sets back to Amazon since season 4 would be useless without seasons 1-3.I have found in the past that usually if a series is glitchy and you get a second one to replace it right away, the next set is usually also glitchy. I think it has to do with the fact that so many discs are produced at one time that they would all be defective from that production run."
3,"Good stuff, but not their best work","This is a good collection of music by The Call. If you are a big fan of the band, it's a ""must buy"" CD. If not, there are other CDs by the band, like ""Into the Woods"" or ""Let the Day Begin"", that I would recommend before this one."
5,Great band all around.,"Every song on this disc is good. This might be alternative or to some it might be rock. Guitar has a taste of the Hendrix sound and bluesy but not overwhelming and better. The bass player and the drummer on top of the percussionist, round out the band perfectly. Edwin's voice is fantastic, it was hard to top him, he left after this disc. These guys sure are talented. To bad it ended so soon."
5,7 Years later it is still a great album,"When I purchased this album in 96 it immedietly became my favorite and it still is today. Very few oher albums can compare to the instumental complexity with which each song is written. Because of this there are no annoying repitious beats that cause listeners to quickly get sick of songs. This record has staying power with 12 songs that add up to over 60 minutes of listening pleasure, it is well worth your buck."
2,Decent but the characters are annoying,"I'll skip the background. Coben's book ""Tell No One"" was very, very good. The problem with this book is that Myron Bolitar is very annoying. His demeanor in front of the FBI and security guards is annoying and not funny or entertaining. Do yourself a favor and buy Tell No One if you want to read a Coben book."
3,Mediocre. Three and a half stars.,"Cradle of Filth's early days. Well, this album isnt too bad....but it isnt the best either. I'm not a big fan of COF'S early days. Dusk and Her Embrace was really good...but Dani's vocals are almost intolerable after awhile. But this doesnt quite touch me in the way Dusk did. Dani's vocals are still pretty intolerable, if not more than in Dusk, and the instrumentals and orchestral passages don't quite rise up to meet those of Dusk's. I don't know...just not a huge fan of this CD."
5,show boat (book),"outstanding book by outstanding writer, Edna Ferber. Sharply drawn characters, each one comes to life. Same author later wrote blockbuster novel ""Giant"". This book was made into the musical ""Show Boat"", which showed bigotry in the South (and along the Mississippi River) in earlier days."
5,remains a classic best,"Years have gone by since I've heard Seawind live, but the news of a possible new album and concerts in LA and Japan have left me excited. This particular collection remains some of the classic best Seawind, and put together in the days on vinyl when you really did appreciate the artistry of how tempo and themes were put together in an artistic order. I won't be flying to LA or Japan soon, but plan to add this CD to my collection, right here in the middle of the old USA. ""Remember"" is a great one but this has all the essential Seawind sounds in my opinion!"
4,If You Really Want This Disc,"I guess it pays off knowing one of the members of the Seawind horn section. These albums are re-released (""Seawind"" (the 1st album) and ""Window Of A Child""), and are being directly sold on Seawind's websight (seawindjazz.com). Both of the albums should be in any jazz, or contemporary christian music library."
2,Could there be too many examples?,"Maybe I'm too used to the theorem-proof structure of other mathematics textbooks. This one leaves me cold: too little is made of the exposition, while the author leans too much on the copious amounts of examples as a crutch. The examples, alas, aren't terribly good; the author pulls ideas from god only knows where, without explanation, often stopping me short in the middle of reading the answer to what should be a simple problem.I don't recommend this textbook. Sadly, I don't know of any better ones. The textbook recommended for the first actuarial exam - _Probability: The Science of Uncertainty_ - is a better book overall, but lacks the requisite depth for a really thorough treatment of the subject."
2,An Intoduction to the Building Architect's Profession.,The author laments the lack of a well defined practice of Software Architecture. The book starts out citing two failed software projects which could have used a software architect.After that it delves into the history of architecture from ancient times to day. An entire chapter is devoted to how the building architect I.M. Pei sucessfully rearchitected the Louvre in Paris in the face of many challenges. So what's that got to do with software architects? While the authors claim that there are parallels between s/w architects and architects of the traditional kind they fail to establish a clear link.An informative and brief read about architects (not the s/w kind) and their profession. If you are looking to be a s/w architect look elsewhere.
3,Useful glossary,"Honestly, I could not have read this book without the useful glossary in the back. Here are a few sample lines sans interpretation: ""I am supposed to be thinking about makeup and my nunga-nungas.... And egg babies....I only just snogged someone a few months ago and now I'm practically married and have an egg child. Jas hasn't got red-bottomosity, so it's all very well for her to be boring. But my bottom demands to be heard."" Yes. Of course. Sometimes I didn't have the slightest clue what Georgia was blathering about, but she was nevertheless terribly fun and clever. Always stays just inside the approved-for-preteens boundary."
4,YA brain candy.,"Rennison continues to amuse and entertain with the latest volume of Georgia Nicolson's confessions. Georgia is an incredibly genuine young lady, and so much fun to identify with. Even for a much older lady, these books are fantastically wonderful to read."
3,What do I think?,"The confessions of Gorgia Nicolson books are great. They are about a girl who has extreme teenage problems, from her fat and flirting cat, to boys and school. I really enjoyed reading the first two books, but this one didnt appeal to me as much. It still had the same mischevious characters, yet Gorgias story just wasnt as full of problems, or as funny as Rennison's other books. I continued reading it, but it felt like things were repeating themselves, and the book kind of draged on. On the other hand, some parts of the book were more fun to read, and I was laughing out loud. I love this authors stlye, and I will keep reading her books, even though this one may not have been as good."
4,Brecht's Alienation,"The book is a good guide on tracing the evolution of the notion of alienation in theater. A different route from the naturalistic theater tradition, alienation aims at ""extracting"" emotions in theater and sticking with the message and aim of a play. Peter Thompson's work indirectly traces the idea of showing that acting is just plain ""acting"". He does this by reviewing the various experiences of staging Brecht's classic ""Mother Courage and Her Children"". For actors dreaming to just plainly ""act"" in theater (acting a character and not being a character), the good is a good guide. For those dreaming to be the mother in Mother Courage and The Mother, Shente in The Good Person of Setzuan, and St. Joan in St. Joan of the Stockyards--learn from this book."
5,getting away with murder...,"i love it, there best album in my opinion, catchy and powerful. good rock alternative album, a long way from their last."
2,not a kid,this album is okay...there are really no standout tracks because they all sound similar. the music is blaring loud and so is the lyrics. there are only 2 sonds that i can sau i liked and that is notlistening and getting away with murder.
4,pretty good stuff.,"I must say, I'm not a huge fan of P.Roach but Scars and Getting Away with Murder are quite good songs, The rest is average with a few other above average songs.Recomended at the price it is available at in this site (10$)"
5,Comments on Papa Roaach cd,This cd was in perfect order. It plays wonderful and my best friend was so happy to get it for Christmas. We both love Papa Roach and we will both be checking this seller for similar items.
2,"Hmmpf... well, there's one sorta good song.","I regret buying this CD. I wish I could grow to like it, but it's just not happening for me. The lyrics are very simplistic, boring and quite cheesy if you ask me, same with the guitar licks. I sorta like the song ""Getting Away With Murder"" because it has a pretty catchy guitar riff, but that's about it.I have tried and tried to let this album grow on me, but in the end I just skip most of the songs and take it out of my CD player.Sorry if this isn't helpful."
3,sounds like theyre trying to get on the warped tour,"ok, i was a fan when i picked up infest and found the hidden track tightrope (keep playing track 11, it'll come up about a minute after the music ends) but this album is a lot poppier than the previous two. it sounds a little too much like dashboard confessional to me, but it may grow on me."
2,shOULD have quit after Infest,"This CD is not good by any means. It gets 2 stars because it has one catchy song, i think #4. If you enjoy Papa Roach-maybe you can suffer through this CD but I was a Papa Roach fan when the Infest album dropped. Infest had a great sound that Papa Roach never seemed to go back to. They are meddling with different styles right now and are unsuccessful in my opinion. Your average junk rock CD-save your money and buy Infest."
5,Papa Roach Rock!!!,"I heard the whole cd and i think its definetly worth buying, if your a papa roach fan then its a must buy i have also purchased Infest which i thought rocked most of the tracks on this album are top notch s$$t!"
5,Papa Roach fans will not be disapointed,"Papa Roach came out with a bang with their first album ""infest"", with such hardcore tracks on it like ""dead cell"" and ""thrown away"". In their second album ""lovehatetragedy"", they showed more of a more mellow, sensative side to their music, with such tracks as ""life is a bullet"" and ""decompression period."" But their new album ""getting away with murder"", they show signs of both previous albums blending together. If you like more mellow papa roach, then tracks like ""scars"" and ""done with you"" are well... for you, if your a hard rocker, then you will like tracks like ""getting away with murder"" and my favorite ""tyranny of normality."" all and all, a must have for papa roach fans, i can't wait for the next one."
2,A dissappointment at best,"Compared with Infest and Lovehatetragedy, this cd can be described as no better than a dissappointment. The lyrics and music both stray so far from the first two cds that got them where they are."
2,NO GOOD FOR SNOWBIRDS,"The book is nice, with accurate information and reviews of the campgrounds with good information on how to find them.However, it's of no use for snowbirds and winter campers, due to a total lack of information on all-year camps and winter activities. Also, the book points usually just one campground in each location, not giving you room for alternatives.Anyway, if you plan a trip from March through October, it's a good buy."
2,Dont Waste Your Money,"I found this book to be big waste of money. It is huge, but big print and with relatively very few campsites reviewed. If you want to take the same trip the author's took, maybe you can use it. but if you want a comprehensive list of campsites in each country with recommendations, this is NOT it. Maps are poor and infrequent and information is generally sparse. Check out Michelin guides for more comprehensive info."
1,"Not what I orded,","The ad was for a AUDIO CD, and I recieved a music book. Not happy. Good thing my boyfriend plays guitar saved me from having to send it back."
4,A Good Introduction to the Power of the Stones,"Although I recommend buying the studio albums rather than collections of hits, this CD is an excellent introductory compilation for those unfortunate souls who are unfamiliar with the power and awesome diversity of the Stones' music. You'll get the classics on this one, and no one should deprive himself of these essential tunes. But after you've listened to this compilation, you'll want to get into the old classics, from Aftermath up through Exile on Main Street. Also, I suggest that you listen to the lyrics to appreciate the panache in the Jagger/Richards songwriting style. They were young lads when they wrote some of their most provocative songs. Great material here for the uninitiated. I've almost forgotten what it was like to hear this stuff for the first time. I yearn for that feeling again."
1,Hot rocks cd is good stones music but the quality of the cd very poor. The cd will not play in my vehicle cd player but will,play in my home cd player. Research as shown this is due to poor cd quality due to the poor reflective quality of the cd. No more purchases for me from this vendor which is megahit records. RP
4,"Like most doubles, this woulda made a great single disk","Most RT albums have 6 or 7 good songs and 3 great ones. This double cd seems like two of those albums, even to having rather different production and bands. I liked the songs better when I mixed them all together on a comp tape.Cold Kisses and Woods of Darney are two of my favorite Thompson songs ever, and there's not a bad track here. This is very near the perfection of Pour Down like Silver, Daring Adventures and Mirror Blue."
3,Not as good as it looks,"This mobile looks great, however the sound quality is horrible and the fluttering birds squeak too much. It catches my son's attention for about 3 minutes and doesnt put him to sleep at all."
3,Cute birds...awkward design,This mobile won't attach to our Davinci Emily crib or any other crib that has top railings that are wider (top to botton) than about 2.25 inches. This was pretty dissappointing because the mobile also doesn't work well as a stand alone item. When not attached to the crib the birds spin alomst directly over the base which makes it impossible to have the baby under the birds.All in all this mobile is still cute and the music and sounds are soothing. We're still waiting for our baby to arrive so I don't know if our kiddo will enjoy watching a mobile that's *next* to his crib yet. If this fits on your crib and if you're careful putting it together to make sure the birds get clicked in correctly I think this would be a great mobile.
1,Does Not Work,"I absolutely love the look of this mobile and bought it for my baby. I put it together and it did not work - no music, no movement, no lights. I took it back to the store and got another one, I figured it was just a fluke. But, again after I put it together it did not work!! I was so frustrated, I tried everything to get it to work, I tried different batteries, I took it apart and put it back together, I read other reviews and tried those suggestions, I called Fisher Price (they told me to exchange it again!), but nothing worked. I can understand one faulty mobile but to get another just proves that this particular mobile is of poor quality. I love Fisher Price, too bad they can't get their act together with this mobile."
4,great novel,"I'm a big fan of Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. She's written fantastic works, and this is her latest addition. I had thought the story of Kiesha'ra was complete with the second book, so I was surprised with this one coming out. I figured it wouldn't be as good because it would be continuing a story that was done. I was wrong. This book takes the series in a whole new direction by introducing a clearer picture of the world of the falcons. I'm not going to give away any of the novel, but I will say it was a great read. I gave it four out of five stars because the ending seemed like she just cut off. It's very obvious there is another book coming. For me, the ending of a novel is one of the most important parts of it. I was disappointed by this ending, so I gave it 4 stars. I look forward to reading the next book."
2,Nice picture if it weren't for the dead pixel,"I was really hopeful when I ordered this DVD player, but it just didn't meet my expectations. The very first time I played a DVD I noticed a dead pixel on the screen. That just isn't acceptable to me. Straight out of the box, I believe there shouldn't be any problems. Other than the dead pixel, the picture was very good. I actually haven't seen any DVD players with a better picture and I've looked at Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Insignia, Zenith, and Audiovox.The sound out of the speakers is pretty decent. However, if you wear headphones, you'll hear a chirping/squeaking noise from the spinning of the DVD. It is pretty annoying to be honest.Also, when you put the DVD in the player, you can feel how cheap the lid is. If you aren't careful, it seems as though you could easily snap the lid off."
4,Great!,I have had the cover for about a month now and it as been working great! It still is snug on my Nexus One!
4,I LOVE OLD GOSPEL,"I can remember my parents playing artist like The Truthettes, James Cleveland, Shirley Ceaser and many more. The Truthettes have wonderful voices mixed with a timeless message!"
3,Very Fragile Item !!!,"I bought four of this item so I can complete my walk-in closet. They were delivered promptly and it was very easy to assemble. The only bad side is that it is very fragile, you can't put any heavy stuff over or in it, you cannot exercise too much preasure or the hardboard will break. The other bad side is that I had to buy extensions separetly so I can fis them to the walls...I think it should have been provided in the box... and the sipping of the extension is a ripp off : a single tiny long piece of metal in a very large box that could contain 20 of those pieces... WHY ????? ?????"
4,I tried it on one foot and it ...,I tried it on one foot and it worked great! I have really rough feet and it made them soft and smooth. I've tried other lotions that work well but that are too thick. This lotion was just right and it worked great!
2,Action Jackson,"A maverick cop (Carl Weathers) is on the trail of a corrupt auto tycoon (Craig T. Nelson). Unfortunately, Action Jackson is a gabfest punctuated by not-so-hot sex scenes. Even with all the talk, screenwriter Robert Reneau has to introduce a character in the last 20 minutes to explain what is happening. There are a couple of good stunt scenes, through. Rated R for violence, drug use, simulted sex, nudity, and profanity. 1988; 95m."
3,"""Maybe this wasn't such a damned good idea after all.""","A great film when it came out, Action Jackson has lost some of its punch since 1988, but it's still watchable. Vanity's performance wasn't that great and hasn't aged well, neither has some of the humor. The action sequences are still great and I still wish they had made a sequel."
4,Cabrel est formidable!,"I have enjoyed this CD ever since my French teacher played it for us in class. Cabrel has a unique style which is a sort of modern folk sound. Many songs have such rich chords and are so expressive that it's hard to stop listening. ""La Cabane du Pecheur"" and ""Je t'aimais, je t'aime, et je t'aimerai"" are my favorites."
2,A Bit Disappointed!,"Being a Lifelong Rodney Fan, I was disappointed with this Box Set. A lot of the time goes to other comedians. Not Enough Rodney. I Didn't Hate It, I just didn't think it was worth the money (Even on Sale!)."
2,Disappointed at best...,"The only reason I didn't give this package a one star, is because there is a couple minutes of ""funny"" on each disc. But it's just the same ol' same ol'. With each passing year, his jokes get more off-color, and he jokes about his wife in a way that's offensive.We've heard some of his stuff via the airplane comedy channels, as my husband and I travel quite a bit. We thought it would be great, because we both love a good laugh. We should've known better: they clean stuff up on the airplanes, for family listening/viewing. We didn't even watch the whole thing, before we turned right around and relisted it here on Amazon.A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY, IN MY OPINION. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CLEAN OR FAMILY VIEWING."
2,not so great,This does not do as much as the description says it will - it only popped up once in 45 minutes of play. It makes no noise at all. One might as well put several items in a brown paper bag and have the kids reach in and try to pull out certain items. Waste of money!
4,ARZ,Like all BEST OF CDs this one has a few non best hits. CDs are not dead close but no cigar Sally
2,Boring Recipes Galore,"This book had very few recipes that I really want to try out. And the pictures leave little to be desired. When you see the finished product of a recipe in picture form, it should make you want to make it and eat it. Mostly, all I wanted to do was turn the page...quickly. I should have kept my money in my pocket or spent it on something else."
3,"Motivation Good, Recipes Bland","We made the spaghetti with meatballs and the walnut brownies over the weekend. The meatballs were good, just a bit bland. The walnut brownies were downright wretched; I literally had to spit them out. I really wanted to like this book but I'm finding the six meals a day too difficult to manage given I have a desk job (can't exactly bring my blender into my office to make the shakes). I do believe that Bill Phillips is a great motivator, and if you have the time, the resources, and the dedication, this plan will work."
3,Written for the US market,This book was ok and gave me a few ideas but I think it is mainly for the US market as some of the foods are unavailable in Australia. We mainly try to stick to unprocessed fresh foods in our diet.
1,Not My Taste.,"I honestly do not recommend this book, unless you have socialist sympathies and enjoy reading about low lifes behaving badly. I suppose the feminist aspect might appeal to female readers, however, in any historical period one can find women working behind the political scene; unfortunately in this novel the women so chosen do not represent anything worth admiration or interest."
2,Lots of promise but what went wrong?,"I have read every Piercey I can find and have seldom been disapppointed. Her writing always takes me into interesting contexts with credible characters. I bought the hard cover of City of Darkness, read it once and then gave it away. The other Piercey's are battered prized possessions I regularly re-read. I guess I did not find the characters convincing and the whole thing was rather forced. But given Piercey's amazing output one book like that can be regarded as an experiment. Perhaps she is more comfortable in the present with those fascinating women who just don't ever give up!"
1,MONEY GRAB,THE ORIGINAL RECORD OF THIS TITLE WAS A 2 CD SET WITH 33 SONGS. IT WAS A GREAT CD 2 PACK. IT WOULD BE WELL WORTH AMAZON.COM'S TIME TO REMIND DISTRIBUTERS NOT TO RIP OFF THIER CUSTOMERS. THIS 1 CD IS MISSING TO MANY GREAT SONGS FOUND ON THE 2 CD SET TO MAKE IT A GOOD BUY
3,Good for the price,The paper is nice and white but it doesn't tear at the micro-perorations easily. The spiral wire holes are stuck together so that the pages often are hard to turn the first time.
5,Ofcourse America can never relase such a box set,"Now this is a BOX set! It's actually the 2nd box set released by bear records in Germany on Waylon. More hopefully on the way. Each CD is PACKED with songs! You get extra Demos and Alternate versions as well. It's sad that a company from Germany is the only one that has the balls to put this out, along with the other box set (Detiny's child). America does everything Fast, Skimpy and cheap! That sound like a Waylon song almost....Fast, Skimpy and Cheap!"
4,Zulu Warfare!,"Zulu Warfare!""The Washing of the Spears: The Rise and Fall of the Zulu Nation"" by Donald Morris describes the Zulu nation from its rise, with the combining of the native clans led by Shaka, to its fall under the guns of the British Army by 1878. The Zulus produced a formidable military force, and this excellent account studies all aspects of the Zulus and the defeat they inflicted on the British at Isandhlwana. Brilliantly done is Morris' explanation of British heroism at Rorke's Drift, where defenders received the most Victoria Crosses ever awarded for a single engagement."
3,Not their best,"I like the Foo Fighters. I LOVE their other two albums, but sadly, this one doesn't quite compare. This is their debut album, their first attempt, which may explain why it isn't as good as their more recent work. I would suggest that you buy ""There is Nothing Left to Lose"" or ""The Colour and the Shape"" first, and if you still want more Foo Fighters, then go for this one, but only then. Don't get me wrong: it is a good CD, and I like it, just not as much as their other 2 albums."
3,"Two great songs, nine good ones, one bad song","""Foo Fighters"" explodes with ""This Is A Call"" and ""I'll Stick Around"", then most of the rest are pretty good, except for ""X-Static"" which is annoying. The Foo Fighter sound is muscular poppy rock. Dave plays mean chords (in fact, he played almost everything on this album) and occasionally simple leads.It's a good sound, real good in concert, and this CD was a fine start to a new group. It definitely helped get him out from under Kurt's shadow."
4,Definately a great album.,"I have to listening to Dave Grohl since Scream. Like many other people, I didn't expect much to ever come from a group fronted by Dave. However, one day I bought the Nirvana single ""Heart-Shaped Box"" which came with a b-side called ""Marigold."" Being a big Nirvana fan, I noticed the absence of Kurt's vocals. I found out that Dave wrote and sang the song himself. This is just a sample of what was to come. ""Foo Fighters"" fulfilled every expectation I had of Dave Grohl and Pat Smear. The entire album is excellent from ""This Is a Call"" to ""Exhausted."" I'm not one to compare one artist to another, so I'll just say that you will not be let down if you purchase this album. If you like it, also try ""The Color and the Shape"""
5,ROCK AND ROLL AT ITS FINEST,"I was a little hesitant about buying this album in 1995, but im so glad i did. As a pure rock and roll fan this album delivers all the way. Most people dont realize that when they listen to this album, that Dave Grohl wrote the lyrics, played both bass, and guitar as well as the drums. This only proves that he is multi talented artist, who doesnt have to live in the shadow of kurt cobain anymore. This album is 44 minutes of pure 100% rock and roll dynamite!"
3,Nothing Special,"Counting out Big Me and For All The Cows, this album is average at best. The ebbing prosody that fetters down the musical horizons of so many people is implicity illustrated by this lack-luster album. By all means, I'm not trying to truncheon the Foo Fighters, they've made many catchy songs that I like, but this album is really porous. There's nothing to it, yet somehow this catapulted the Foo Fighters into bigtime celebrity status. Tepid rock albums continually abetted by the domineering music industry tend to shape the populace's opinion of good music so beguilingly that the average music fan can't find an alternative to forced satisfaction. Sadly, there are millions of great records that these people will never unearth because of their musical ignorance and unintentional adherence to pop-culture standards. Basically all I'm saying is that people should broaden their horizons and look beyond the mediocre albums, because I guarantee there is much more to be found."
5,"Great, deep album","This is a solid album put forth by Foo Fighters, the lyrics are thoughtful and cryptic. From the heavy rockers like 'Weenie Beenie' and 'Wattershed' to the quieter songs like 'X-Static' and 'Big Me,' it's great all around, with an amazing ending - 'Exhausted.'One of their best."
1,"G'dammit, amazon!","WTF, I ordered this thing weeks ago and no further word...now I check things out myself, I find that this product has been discontinued!!! What the hell they offered it for sale in the first place, then! I don't suppose I would've ever been informed had I not checked back my darned self to find out what's with the hold-up!amazon customer service has really gone down!!!!"
3,"Remember, it is a text book.","I bought this book for an environmental geology course at Idaho State University as part of my interdisciplinary studies in the environment. Keller's book is informative and comprehensive providing both wide coverage and indepth calculations and examples of how to measure environmental events quantitatively. The professor of the course used the book's material in class; however, he was often critical of the simplicity of the illustrations and graphs. I will keep the book as a reference for environmental processes and human impact on the environment. I will not read the book for pleasure, though. It is a text book and can put a reader to sleep quickly."
4,Real Love!!,"This book was different. It was not like most stories I have read. A story of young love, trials, and tribulations. Going through life's journey trying to find your way. Trying to do the best with the hand you've been dealt.The book is about a young girl name Natasha and a young boy name Antonio. The book opens ""Babe the first thing I need to know from you is do you believed I killed my father?"" That caught my attention right away and I was immediately drawn into the story line. I started this book yesterday and I could not put it down. It was a great and emotional read. Eloquently written and easy to understand, where both of the main characters were coming from.This is the authors 1st novel. Having read Conception (2nd novel) a few weeks ago I knew she would not disappoint!"
5,Wonderful,"This is a crushing love story between Natasha and Antonio, both from Harlem. Antonio is sent to jail at 17 when he is accused of murdering his violent and abusive father. Natasha hasn't been dealt an easy hand either, but she is a focused, driven and ambitious young woman who does her best to become the best she can and help those around her. Through letters between the two we see their relationship develop and how each of them grows and deals with what they're going through. They are deeply attaching and moving characters who show you the possibilities of what you can achieve in life. Buckhanon is a talented author and through these letters she addresses many different social issues about education, race etc. This story made me smile and cry, and there are a lot of things that make it unforgettable. I cannot recommend it enough."
3,Not an academic book,"I was looking for something more meaty and this book is written on an 8th grade reading level, which gives me little faith in it's target audience - day care employees. That being said, its a decent overview of the theorists and can be read in one Sunday afternoon. Kind of like a 'Day Care for Dummies.' You'll know roughly when the scholars lived and a very general outline of their ideas. Perfect for a teen or middle-schooler who baby sits and has some intellectual curiosity about what's going on in the mind of her neighbor's rug rats. Great for a new mom that is not a huge reader. But not an academic book."
5,Perfect!!,Every childhood/education major should have this book. I have used this book for countless papers with great success. It is basic and very easy to read and understand but has lots of useful information.
2,SAME AS MOST CONSUMMERS,"I FOUND THEM, TO BE WHAT MOST OTHERS STATED. YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET. I DID FIND THEM CHEAPER AT SMART BARGAINS, BUT BOUGHT HERE ANWAY. THEY ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE WORK SITE. I WOULDN'T PUT THEM OUT FOR GUEST'S."
4,Well made DVD,"I was worried that the age of the movie would show on this DVD. That is it would show the deterioration of the age of the movie. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was done.The only thing that could have made it better was to colorize it. One teen son enjoyed this with me. The other hates to watch B/W. And for the sake of a wider audience, colorizing would help this film.I must have grown a lot since I saw this on TV years ago. I didn't cry this time."
4,"If You're New to the Stones, Read This.","You don't want to buy this album if you're not familiar with the Stones. This is a collection of pre-Sticky Fingers outtakes that didn't make the cut on the original early London albums. Don't get me wrong - this is a great bunch of songs, but they are probably only appreciated by people already very familiar with the early Stones. Buy Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, and maybe Aftermath before venturing here."
4,An essential track....,"..For sure it's an album of outtakes but ""I'm going down"" deserves to beamongst the essential tracks by Keith..awesome..."
4,TERRIFIC!!!,"It seems like only yesterday. This was my fifth ever trance CD and I was completely bowled over by it. My enjoyment of it has never changed, except that in the first year I loved the first CD (he grabs you right away from the first note...and I was a novice) but, over the years, the one that has stayed with me is the second. It is hard to get out of my system. Several hundred CD's later I can drop this in the player and it's like the first time. I'm playing it now. I've become a total fan and I just don't question him at all. Like Sasha or Paul Oakenfold, if his name is on it, I buy it... and I have never been disappointed. This album is great, creative, varied... and it kicks! He's amazing. Four stars (one short) because I waver... a little... on the first disc now."
4,"Not Bad, Too Disco.","global underground's 2000 release of dave seaman's time spent in buenos aires is exactly what dom phillips says on the back cover of the cd: ""gelatinous glitterball grooves"". i would give it three and a half stars if i could, but i won't humiliate it with a three. so GU:012, well, it's a little too ""discoteque"" for my taste. several tracks work into a very good rhythm where the bass lines are firm and you can't keep your head from bobbing. others get a little too flitty and many vocals don't have any angelic feel to them, which i like. in any case, it's a very nice addition to anyone's trance collection. if you're looking for your first experience with trance, however, then sasha (GU: Ibiza) or oakenfold (another world or GU: NY), and oakenfold more so , would be better."
4,refreshingly light sounds and grooves of prog house/trance,"Whew, after the onslaught of trance DJ's who have decided to play ""darker and deeper"", this is such a breath of fresh air, blending house and light grooves with the sounds of trance. The CD casing actually gets it right by calling it glitterball grooves.Now for more traditional trance lovers, some tracks may not agree; Jumbo, So Damn Beautiful, and One of the People are vocal-led progressive house pieces that are excellent but maybe not what you are looking for. I say they fit just right in the set, and strengthen the discs.This set, along with his Renaissance America (and just about anything Global Underground) comes highly recomended."
5,Exploading with Greatness,"From beginning to end this album will move you. With exception to maybe ""Transport"" by Oakenfold this album flows together better then any trance/dj/whatever recording out there. I highly recomend this album if you are looking to get into the whole trance scene, or if you just need a great album. Check it out, and especially enjoy the last song."
1,DO NOT BUT IT. PERIOD!,"This is really ""throw your money in garbage"" book! Not worth a penny. (I took other decipline. I don't know about ""other"" deciplines!) Its like you want to go to London from New York. This book will take you to Timbuktu!! Its amazing how the same author has two very different books! Where the FE review manual from Lindeburg is so great, every page of that book is worth reading, this one, the entire book is garbage. Not worth a penny!"
4,"Good, quick meal","Stir fry some green beans with your noodles and you have a quick, somewhat healthy meal. I don't find it particularly spicy, but I happen to like hot food. I mix in a bit of Sriracha, which is a Thai chili-garlic sauce for a bit of extra kick. I just wish this product had less sodium."
4,rich and spicey,"Most Asian-food-in-a-box kits are kind of bland, but this one is rich and flavorful and spicy. If you don't like spicy food, maybe you should skip this one or add lots of vegetables to dilute it."
2,"Arwen on card, just what collectors want!","1st let me say that I didn't open this figure so I gave it the middle durability rating. This could only be determined after opening it, so don't go by my estimate. I don't expect kids to have much fun playing with it since Arwen had no action scenes in the movie. From a collector's point of view it is a great toy. A good likeness of the actress with great detail to the outfit featuring cloth as well as the usual plastic. Even includes her sword. Allthough not seen in the movie, it is modled after Arwen's sword as issued by the official replica swords released in the past year or so. The figure features a light up ""Evenstar"" necklace which is activated by a button on the figures back. Packaged on new skinny, green Fellowship Of The Rings card back."
5,The Goddess of the Rings,"Arwen is cool.Too cool to be exact.Toys r us im gonna go ahead and be honest...you've truly out done yourselves this time.Arwen is my all-time favorite action figure of the the new trilogy assortment line so if you wanna make more sells and make more custumers happy, you better keep his item in-stock for as long as you can.At least until this summer when they start releasing new trilogy figures.I've been trying to get my hands on five of these Arwen dolls and let me tell ya' it ain't easy.She's very valuable."
2,basic stroker info,"Much of the tech in this book is general Winsor engine related...maybe 10 pages are stroker specific, very basic.The rest of the book is filled with magazine like projects, meaningless pics of pistons and crank being assembled in various speed shop and endless list of mail order kits.Bad buy..."
2,wierd sizing,"I'm not sure what others see in this pant. It is not women's sizing like the caption says. I ordered an XL which is the size I wear, and no part of it fit me. The waist was the right size, but the hips were too big and the inseam too long. And the leg length! I could have cut off 10 inches and it still would have been long enough. I was going to return it but had my husband try them on and they fit him! He is 6'2"" and 240 lbs and they were too long on him! They are definitely cut for a man's shape."
4,Petite pants would be better.,It would be nice if the pants came in short or petite sizes. The pants were a little long. I had to hem them. Otherwise they are very comfy.
1,Yuck!,"I thought they were like the regular adidas pants but they are not. I hate how the bottom is cut, its like a flare kid of cut ."
5,Beautiful voice,"Kate writes good, she sounds good, and it's only a matter of time before she hits right on the perfect song. She has a great music video out that is from this cd as well. It's a bit hard to find but I'm glad I found her."
1,Broken off with in a Month,Though I thought this would be a nice cover. The clips that hold it on to the top portion of the phone cracked and broke off within the first month.
3,Good.,"I like The Caspar The Friendy ghost cartoons, I watched them when I was little and I saw this live action movie on viedo tape and though I prefer the cartoons this is good too and I like the cast, especially Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci and I liked the Caspar character."
3,Decent,"These came in handy in a pinch for work, since we weren't allowed to wear any visible piercings. The backing is poor, however. It's just a little clear elastic on the back, so they pops off really easily and get lost. They're hard to see when they fall out because they are clear.Good for very temporary occasions when needed, but I don't recommend this for long term use."
5,Tiger Flower,"I recently purchased the book ""Tiger Flower"" for my grandson's 5th birthday. It is out of print so a new one cost $143.00, so I bought a used one. It was in perfect shape and my grandson loves it."
2,Not real Chris Ledoux,"I've been a Chris fan for more than 25 years, he's my favorite singer, and I have all his CDs. This is not one of his better albums. ""Stampede"" and ""Take Me to the Rodeo"" are classic Chris songs about rodeo and the West, but the rest is pretty weak. Some record honcho must have decided Chris had to sing non-Western/sappy love songs to broaden his appeal, and songs like ""Gravitational Pull"" and others just aren't real Chris tunes. This CD and ""Haywire"" are his weakest Cds."
5,"Terrific intro to simile, metaphor, hyperbole, etc","We are using this for homeschool language arts, and I was afraid it would be over kiddo's head, but the writer has a real knack for communicating with children. The art didn't distract and the examples were interesting and ample. My son was all ears and caught on to more than I thought he would on the first read. Go for it!"
4,Pretty and light,These earrings are exactly as pictured; they are lightweight and easy to wear. One thing that may not be clear from the picture is that the earwire is attached directly to the heart; there is no dangle or movement to these earrings.
1,Yikes.,"I love low budget cheesy B Sci-Fi movies. I really do. The campier the better. So i got this assuming that the negative reviews were people expecting a blockbuster, but this was just awful. I can't even think of anything constructive to say about this one....."
4,Economical and practical flatware,I have used Oneida Emery and have found it very practical and long lasting. Price is also very reasonable and affordable....
4,Mobile Rack,This works great and is well constructed; however I only use the rack to backup data. I do not trust these units to keep a high speed drive cool.
3,Helps move potted plants around,"I bought 2 of these. Very nice, except one wheel broke off the very first week. Now it's stationary with a brick under it. Not much help now."
2,Be Careful,Worked fine for a couple of uses and then the moter burned out on my trimmer. I think the trimmer wasn't designed to power anything heavier than the plastic line that are in the spools. And these blades are definitely heavier than the line and required more power to run them.
3,decent for the price,"As soon as I got this, I couldn't wait to put it on. But then I noticed that it didn't fit my grass hog weed trimmer the way it was suppose to. I had to make some modifications to the actual weed trimmer before I could put it on. Once I put it on, it worked like a charm for the first few times. Last week was my third time using it and one of the blades completely snapped off at the hinge, which made it useless. I guess that's what I get for purchasing cheap plastic. I returned my electric grass hog for a gas powered Homelite weed trimmer and bought another, much more sturdy, attachment."
1,Unsafe,Second time I used this item it broke and flew off across the yard - just lucky it didn't come back at me.
4,Grass Gator Trimmer Head,"Head would not fit my Weed Eater Electric Trimmer Model EL-13TNE. After much struggling to try to get the head to fit, I ended up forcing the head on the Weed Eater and then drilling several holes so that I could secure the head in place with screws. After all that effort fortunately it turned out to be much better at trimming and is much faster than the original string trimmer head."
5,This man is amazing,He writes with such passion and he is truly an inspiration. I picked up this book not knowing what it would be about. It has brought me back to church and I can honestly say that I am now closer to God because of this book. I read it all the way through and it makes you not want to put the book down. This is bar far one of the best psychic books on the market today. It is great to see the energy that was put into this book. Psychic Stephen Piperno is truly an inspiration.
5,Piperno Prophet is an all star writer,"Piperno is by far one of the greatest writers of our day. I truly appreciate his book now after reading it and it ministered to my heart. I found this book to be inspiring and easy for me to absorb. He comes across as being very much down to earth and having so much wisdom at the same time. Truthfully, I loved this book and I would definetely buy it all over it again. My prayers are with Stephen Piperno and his ministry. Great website by the way and video."
3,A decent modern western nothing more or less,"In a genre as cliched as the western the staple revenge turn of the story is almost a given. So while Shadowheart doesn't exactly blow the doors off your preconceptions, those open to a good yarn told at a solid pace will find something to enjoy. The cast of young fresh faces is peppered with some authenticity by Sadler, Howard, Napier in their small roles. While the production design could use a few more pounds of dirt and there are moments where the music just doesn't fit, I found myself engaged and fairly wrapped up in this tale of the wild west. The authentic Navajo spoken by the Native Americans was a nice touch, and this movie serves up a ""cartoon"" classic bad guy in a good way as well. Great rental for western fans as they will get mostly what they came for. Not exactly the epic the box states but still light years better than the likes of SILVERADO."
1,Boring,"I am sorry but this movie is boring, pointless, and a waste of time. I have to agree with many other reviewers here ... 2 over 10."
2,"get ""Open Range"" instead.","This is going to be my shortest review ever. The movie Open Range, with Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner, does what this movie tries to do, but does it ten times better. Just skip this one and get Open Range - a truly great Western. You'll thank me later."
1,A real disapointment,"This beautifully shot movie has some great acting and beautiful scenery, but the mixed messages of revenge/retribution/stopping evil/forgiveness are never fully explored or explained. It could have a really good movie, but it seemed like the director was torn between shooting it as a morality tale or as a quasi-Clint Eastwood western. My family was left looking at each other like...""What?"" Great potential, but not realized."
2,Poor effort,"I could almost hear Don LaFontaine's voice over trailer in my head ""Starring no-one, you've ever heard of"" as I began this movie, but thought I would give it a chance, as I love the Western movie genre.Trouble is that it's been done infinitely better than this, and as good an idea of trying to revive the western (again) this is a dry, and boring flick.The script is actually not that bad, predictable but still OK, it just never gets going. Everyone seems to be spending so much time being laconic and ""in character"" they forget to actually act.Not too much else to say really. Cowboy with closet full of skeletons much face evil land baron (and his own inner demons) to save the day, win the girl, rescue the town blah de blah blah.Where's Randolph Scott when you need him?2 stars."
3,Nice little Western...,Nothing new with this one. Obviously little money spent here and it shows. No sprawling vistas as seen in the the classics. Some good acting but it's not sufficient for me to recommend this.
3,Lots of Extras needed if you had income in multiple states,"I was pretty disappointed to find out I had to pay twice as much to be able to file in two states. No one ever tells you this when you buy it, but only after you have it do you realize you need Turbo Tax State program as well."
1,Yuch!,"Don't do it! Most likely it won't install correctly. Many people this year, including me, simply cannot run Turbo Tax. I spent hours on tech support TWICE, tried the ""fixes"" on the message boards at their web site, and still nothing. It simply will NOT run.Intuit used to be a good company with good products and good customer service and tech support. But that was 10 years ago. Now? Lousy everything. I know more about their products than their tech support people. They seem to have been pulled off the street and given one hour of training.I may try Tax Cut but I'm bummed about the review below that says TT is better than Tax Cut. If that's true, TC must REALLY be lousy! But what else can I do? TT won't work on my computer."
1,Don't buy it if you have ESPP or stock option,Can't believe that the company is so deceived when stripping out the ESSP features from the deluxe version. The 2003 deluxe version was fine. My wife spent hours trying to figure out why her return did not sound right and finally found out that you had to buy the premier version for additional $30. The hassle and frustration overweighted the benefit using the turbotax.This kind of company should die.
2,"Security risks and a ""bait and switch""","None of the downloads or other Web-enabled features work through the firewall, and (unlike every other piece of SW in existence) it didn't even try. If it had tried, I could have told the firewall to allow it through. So I have to leave my computer unprotected while I am working on my finances, very bad. I told it to download one state but it downloaded another instead, and now wants me to pay $30 for the state I asked for in the first place. Customer service fixed that for me, thankfully. The program itself is easy to use, like all such programs, but in some combinations of filing status and income, makes huge errors in calculations. The explanations are a bit more helpful than in the past."
1,TurboTax - a terrible product from a terrible company,"I purchased TurboTax 2004 Deluxe directly from Intuit. After 20 days of waiting and several hours with customer service agent who I could barely understood, I finally got the disk. I proceed with the installation process and it failed. The InstallShield Wizard closes when it gets to the ""Searching for Installed components"" screen. It does not generate error message. I get the chat support and the tech could not resolve it and tried to give me a pay support phone line, which costs $9.99 per incident? After more research, multiple problems with update and State download. Back to my problem, I found a work around from a user forum. Intuit has posted a work around. So Intuit knew about the problem and still ship the product to customers. If you paid for a product, should you be expect to use a work around that requires you to delete the InstallShield from your computer? I think not. get a refund and buy Tax Cut."
3,What happened to the State tax ??,"Hi,There is no mention in the Product Description of State Taxes.Did they leave this out this year????Good Luck,roy"
2,Bad platform label from Intuit,"Apparently they've dumped support for NT but didn't label their product properly, listing NT on boxes I saw at the store. It is very difficult to figure it out on their support site. If you're getting an error in install ""Could not load CustControlls.dll"" this could be why."
2,Stock Options and Stock Purchase No Longer Supported,"I've used Turbo Tax for the last 5 years, and found it to be excellent. For some ridiculous reason, though, this year the company decided to not include support for ISOs and ESPP sales in TT Deluxe. They expect you to pay an extra 30 bucks to have them calculate those. I guess they figure that it's OK for them to rip you off if you benefitted from either of these. Ridiculous!! This may be my last year using TT."
2,WARNING to Macintosh Users...,"It is impossible to install TurboTax State 2004 on Macs. None of the keys for installing the State version work on the Mac, according to Intuit. Replacement Mac CDs will not be available until ""late January or February."" Obviously, this also thwarts the use of TurboTax Federal since state tax liability is deductible from federal taxes. The ""solution"" is to buy the minimal TurboTax Basic which does federal taxes only and calculate state tax manually, or pay a preparer to do it. This sort of thing is an ongoing problem for Mac users with Intuit products."
3,Good basic functionality but...,"...each year it gets a little more cluttered with advertising, & licensing garbage. Also, there are too many different products making it difficult to choose the right one each year -- wish they would just sell one product that did the job!! The software also seems a little less helpful each year. The ""Deluxe"" , ""basic"" & ""Premier"" software should be replaced by a single product -- this wasteful marketing (including various mail-in offers, etc.) just makes extra pointless work for all of us. The Deluxe verion is a little overpriced."
1,TURBOFRAUD 2004,"I purchased this product for a VERY SPECIFIC NEED. The product arrived within 3 weeks, which was good. I was GREATLY looking forward to using it. I have had so much success with my other TURBO TAX Products. I went to install it and start my use. I received a message reading THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE. I was stuck with a blank, unuseable, wasted disc. I have tried several times to contact the seller and the company, but get brick walled. Now, facing a time limit. I have to search for another product. No more TURBO TAX for me."
1,Do not bother with this software,"Last year I had problems with downloading the state forms. This year they sent me the disk but I cannot even purchase it, their web page keeps locking up. Called their personal assistance line and was told to try later. With all the time spent trying to get the software to work It may be cheaper to go to a tax preparer"
3,LOL India,Just strikes me as funny that we have a company that makes US Tax filing software and they outsource all the support to India. Then again it might have been made there.Now I wonder if it is processed there yet?
1,Stick to TaxCut if you are on the Mac,"TurboTax for Mac does not import TaxCut data. It says that it does on the box, but it doesn't. Intuit's website confirms this. Beware the false advertising. I'm sending this back and using TaxCut again."
1,Last year for TurboTax,"As a 7+ year TT user, I've got to say that 2004 will be my last year. After collecting $40 for Deluxe, they fleeced me for $30 more so that I could complete the ESPP section of my taxes. This was previously included in Deluxe, but no warning was given that they made this change (fewer features for the same price). Plus I'm tired of the terrible support and the annual rebate game they force me to play to get my $10 or $30 back. Will check out TaxAct and TaxCut next year."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"Confusing, buggy software (example: clicking on ""go to where I left off"" takes you to the very beginning every time, forcing you to search through the ""interview"" steps to find your place.)Terrible customer service (wait on hold forever, get an unhelpful person with an accent I can't even understand, then get cut off, repeat)An almost impossible-to-follow rebate process (enter all of your information online, only to reach a page that tells you that you now have to print everything out and mail it in with supporting documents. It never tells you what those documents are.)I have used other tax preparation programs before that have worked much better."
1,BUGGY SOFTWARE!!,"I agree with some previous reviewers. This software is BUGGY. Installation itself is not a problem, but excution is. When I ran it for the first time, to my surprise, on many pages different texts were overlaped. It really should not happen to a program that has been sold for so many years. I decide to wait for a while before running it again and hopefully there will be some patches or any sorts that could resolve the problem. It seems that they rushed to get it out before other tax reporting softwares this time."
3,It's only ok,"I bought this CD with the expectation of the usual quatity of Global Underground and Pappa, but I was disappointed. The beat never picks up, only teasing you and disappearing quickly. Most of the other tracks just drone on. On the brighter side, I can fall asleep with it."
4,It's a dark and unpredictable ride...but Pappa's in control,"This CD will definitely transform your mood. It has a very futuristic, underground, cellar-type sound. CD1 flows smoothly on a dark edge, and CD2 is more a bit more uplifting, but the dark edge is still very apparent; although a not as smooth flowing as CD1, but I think it's more meant to make you move. If you do let your imagination run wild, it has that sort of ""Matrix"" air to it. Basically, if you like your trance and house dark (but not evil) then this could be an essential. I think it's a good buy because it definitely has the quaility of GU and that it's definitely a different flavor for the GU syndicate. Seeing him live would be interesting."
4,Great Set....with a minor(?) flaw,"Just received my set. On Disc(2), Chattanooga Choo Choo, is really Ellington's,""In My Solitude"", if I'm not mistaken. I am very disappointed, I have heard the BBC rendition of Choo Choo, and was looking forward to owning it."
1,sucktacular,"Not only was this movie not even the least bit frightening, the plot was convoluted, boring, and well...it just plain sucked. Take it from a horror movie aficionado and skip this one, or at the very least rent it first."
4,Just a good Horror movie,"Now this is how good horror movies are done! Korean, American, doesn't matter. Doesn't matter that there are subtitles. This is just hand's down a creepy-fun movie! FANTASTIC cast. The little girl is so good. Excellent unique twist on a common horror theme. I really enjoyed Phone."
3,Mankells Wallander,"Very Interesting interpretation of books! This version of Wallander is not as like able as Branagh's interpretation, but they are both equally as interesting programs."
2,Would not recommend,"They looked great out of the package, but are completely pilled up now that they've been washed three times. I would not recommend them."
4,Shining Album~,Congratulations to Mr. Percy Sledge on keeping the soul and spirit of his soulful stylings alive and well. A job VERY well done!!!This man just keeps on getting better! Try this Album if you want to feel the soul!JR~
4,Great American rock & roll. A passionate voice w/medium grit,"Memory in the Making is very spirited with songs like Green, yellow and Red and Red Blue Jeans. Hooray for Dream Queen. The slide on Give Me a Highway makes this Eastern Carolina country fool head west for the Rockies. Great vocal on the title tract as well as Heart and Soul. I liked this one as well as Mellencamp's Whenever We Wanted and much better than Human Wheels. Much better than anything Tom Petty put out during the Eighties. I play this one on weekend mornings when I write. I've known Memories in the making for just 3 years now, but I rank it definitely in my ten favorite albums of the nineties."
1,"What, no added tracks?","Why is it that David Bowie can come up with some extra music for all his CD re-issues, as most artists can, but the Stones can't. I know the stones have tons of demos and even intramentals (cause I have many on bootlegs). This is just another money making attempt by LSE Mick. Com'on guys, give us some value for our money, throw a few old tracks of something at us. Would it hurt so much?"
5,The Best.................,"""Let it Bleed"" is the album I remember the most. It played at every party I attended during the 70's. I love the music on it. And I listen to it at least once a day."
5,Pure Enjoyment,"From opening track of ""Gimmie Shelter"" to the last track of ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and everyting in between, this is a solid Stones recording that is pure enjoyment and one of their best..."
4,Go Charlie Go!,"What truly drew me to album was not the singles, Keith or even Mick but Charlie Watts drumming on ""you can't always get what you want""! Listen to this man pound on the skins and you can feel all the urgency and hopefulness that envelopes the closing of this album. Truly one of the most outstanding albums ever released. If you only want to own a few Stones albums then this should be at the top of your list!"
2,The album is brilliant - the advertising false,"I do want to clarify that this review is not of the album Let it Bleed, which is one of the all time greats in rock history, but of the misrepresentation given by Universal Music Group about the release.This album was released advertised as an SACD Hybrid disc. I see that it no longer is. The inference is that the audio is 5.1. It is not. If you purchase this or any of the ABKCO re-release discs expecting 5.1 audio you will be disappointed."
3,Buyer Beware: Won't Play in All Machines!,"In my car, on my computer, and in my Sony Discman, the sound quality jumps out--truly amazing. But buyer beware, this cd will not play in all machines. For my home stereo system, I use a Panasonic DVD/CD Player; Model DVD-RP 56. This cd will not play--very frustrating!I wrote to ABKCO about this problem nearly a month ago--no response to date...."
1,The songs are in the wrong order!,"This is the first record I ever bought, and it is one of my favorites. Part of what makes the record so great (and the CD awful) is the order in which the songs appear. This CD seems to be some second rate re-issue. The songs do not appear on the CD in the order they do on the original record or in the order that amazon lists them in their description."
2,"FACTS,NOT FANTASY!","I'M NOT SURE WHAT FANTASY WORLD YOUR LIVING IN,BUT ""HONKY TONK WOMAN"" WAS NO 1 FOR 4 WEEKS,NOT 14! FURTHER,""COME TOGETHER"" WAS THE FLIP SIDE OF ""SOMETHING"",WHICH OF COURSE GOT TO NO 1. PERHAPS SOMETHING/COME TOGETHER WAS NOT A NO 1 SINGLE FOR 7 OR 8 WEEKS BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS BUYING ABBEY ROAD AT THE TIME WHICH CONTAINED THESE TWO SONGS! LET IT BLEED HAD A COUPLE GOOD SONGS ON IT ,AND A BUNCH OF FILLER."
3,"DARN GOOD IN SPOTS,NOT SO GOOD IN OTHERS","SOME OF THE BEST STONES MUSIC IS HERE,LIKE GIMME SHELTER AND YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT. SOME HORRORS ARE ALSO HERE,LIKE MONKEY MAN AND COUNTRY HONK(WHAT OH WHAT WERE THEY THINKING OF WITH THESE?). SOME OF THE REST IS OKAY,LIKE MIDNIGHT RAMBLER AND LET IT BLEED. LOVE IN VAIN IS FAIR,AS IS YOU GOT THE SILVER.DESPITE THESE INCONSISTENCIES,THE HIGH POINTS ARE THERE,JUST PROGRAM OUT THE LOWS."
5,Love this product,I chose this product because it was recommended to me and I find that it lives up to its advertised purpose. i received the item before the allotted time and was pleased with the safe packaging. i would order from this seller again.
2,Contradictory Information,"The author does have some good points, but not everything he says is entirely accurate. Some of the pharaohs names are not exactly accurate and some information such as that on Nefertiti is not up to date."
2,"Overpriced, ad misrepresents","The cork mat is good quality, but the ad misrepresents the item. I received one cork mat. I thought I was receiving 12 based upon CM12-12 12"" Cork Mat and the photo. With shipping, one mat cost $12.00. With restocking fee and shipping, it is not worth returning, but I feel mislead by seller. I won't buy from them again."
4,Not a flashlight. But great as a lantern,Your supposed to be pull up the side so that the light will point to one direction but it doesn't work good enough to use to point to something to see it more directly. I felt deceived because it said flashlight so I thought you could pull all the sides up and use it as a regular flashlight. Perhaps they should call it a spot light/flashlight combo. It only works great as a lantern. The light it bright and lights up rooms well.
5,A Must for Bluegrass Fans,The highlight of the box set was the concert of Lester Flatt and Bill Monroe. This was culminated in their being reunited again and singing together in the concert at Vanderbilt University on disc 6. This was my favorite part of the whole collection. Their singing together reminded me of the manner in which they sang together in the mid-1940s before they began performing separately. This set is a must for bluegrass fans and especially for the fan who enjoys hearing Lester Flatt and Bill Monroe sing together.
3,wish it was brighter,"The light casing is high quality, but the bulbs are not very bright. I have tried new batteries twice but no change."
4,"Very bright, but UV seems moderate","The white light is very bright compared to mags and the sort. When using the Black light portion I have to use the second setting using all the LEDs, for the 3-Led setting just isn't very effective for my purposes. Overall decent multi use light source for cheaper than forensic stores."
4,I Am What I Am...,"The Great Shirley Bassey (a.k.a ""I Am What I Am) was officially released in 1984. The album includes re-recorded versions of her most loved songs, ""Goldfinger"", ""Big Spender"", ""Never, Never, Never""...Highlights: ""I AM WHAT I AM"" & ""I YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND"". A Super dynamic Voice accompanied by a rich Orchestra."
2,Exceptions,Make sure you visit Grass Gator's website to see if this unit fits your trimmer and even then be careful. It did not fit my Stihl FS46 (and the FS46 is not on the exception list) even with the FS45 adapter. I had to modify the adapter to make it work so if you are not handy make sure it fits the trimmer you have.
5,to the point Power pop,yeah- this Cd is great and I'm glad I bought it- a great band- seen them live and they're even better than the disc- anyway- get this Cd if you like rock/pop or anything in between- their website is cool too - jelbait.com -=and so it goes-get too much imagination!!!! will turn2
5,Great silverware,"I purchased this set to add to the set I purchased 15 years ago. I don't know how, but silverware apparently disappears over time. Anyway, the set showed up and the only difference I noticed was in the knives, the new knives are solid and heavier. I contacted Oneida and they told me that they would exchange my old knives for the new knives for free just so my set would match. Thanks Oneida!"
5,"Durable, everyday flatware",I received a set of this flatware 10 years ago when I moved out on my own. I'm now married and our family is expanding. I am in the process of purchasing more of this same style to add to our collection.
4,Oneida Flight vs Flight II,"I've owned the Oneida Flight pattern (originally called ""Reliance"") for years and loved the silverware. However, in trying to buy more I've learned that not only do they make the regular version but they also they did make a cheaper version of this pattern since it was one of their most popular looks. There is a huge difference in quality between the Flight peices and the ultra-inexpensive version called Flight II. I've seen them side by side in person and it's easy to tell, but online it's hard to tell which you are buying. If you like the look and want a quality but still relatively inexpensive set just make sure you don't get the Flight II sets."
4,Maybe Their Best,"After the release of their disappointing sophomore effort ""This Is the Modern World"", The Jam bounced back in a major way a year later with this razor sharp collection of pop-punk gems. Weller, while still in his early-twenties at the time, ably demonstrates his growth as a songwriter, lyricist, and guitarist on this album. Perhaps their strongest set of songs."
2,"Very cute, but arrived damaged","The Memory Box itself is very cute and a good size to contain all those little newborn keepsakes. The two inserts on the front have glass covering them up and then reversible blue/pink inserts. However, mine arrived today from Amazon and was damaged. The wood had a stress crack at the corner of the frame cutout and the upper right portion of the box and lid had a dent/scratch in it. The box is packed in a cardboard outer box where all but the front of the Memory Box is protected. This damage must have occurred before it was shipped out to me as my UPS box was in good shape."
4,Great Christmas present,"Gave to my 7 year old niece for Christmas. It was the hit of the presents. She loved to pull the rope and make the dog bark. Not sure of the long term play value once the rope pulling wears off, but for a few weeks it'll be her best friend."
5,momofteenboys,"Love this book -- kept my 17-year-old busy for day! Educational and fun. It made a great gift and would be a good supplement to home-school flight or physics curriculum. Go for it, mate!"
4,Memories...all except one!,"Ahh... Enchantment! There's something about hearing their music that just seems to capture the moment. I believe I can remember exactly where I was when I first heard ""Sunshine"" on the old AM station KGFJ back in L.A. ""It's You That I Need"" takes me straight back to the first girl I dated in college. But there was one gem that was surprisingly missing here -- what happened to ""Any Way You Want It"", from 1979? Sure, it wasn't quite a monster hit, and is just a tad disco-tinged, but it has the catchiest tune of all their singles and is actually my favorite Enchantment song of all. Fortunately I still have the original vinyl 45 single, but it would have been great to hear it remastered on CD. For this reason only, I've rated this album 4 stars, rather than 5. Other than that, this is a fantastic set of songs!"
5,Talented Singers,I grew up listening to this group of talented men and their voices are wonderful. My mother owns either 3 or 4 of their LPs and they sound good to this day. Enchantment has been underrated for years and I do not know why. They need more classy men and love songs like that today.
5,"Awesome for leather seats, plastic car door panels and walls.","I love these pads for cleaning the leather and plastic surfaces in my car. In my experience, nothing else gets out the ground in grime or stains like these. The microfiber of the sponge gets into surface textures like nothing else can. I also use them to get handprints and other dirt off wall surfaces. A real game changer! They are a little pricey and wear out fairly quickly but when compared to the other forms of labor and materials to get inferior results, it's well worth paying."
5,Amazing,"I finally found some things it does not clean but count is under 3.Most amazing--after scrubbing with everything possible including using full strength bleach and ever scrubber I own, I could not remove what I have learned to be artillery fungi that makes black round dots on vinyl siding. Magic eraser was fast, little scrubbing. First read this tip from a teen in ny state posting online about magic eraser.Kitchen floor that was made with thousands of textured depression. Scrubbing with every known brush, solvent and brush...etc always looked dirty. After discovering siding, got on my hands and knees and amazingly the pad is able to clean even all the depressions. I had even tried comet, zud, barkeep that had not worked. Floor looks great at 17 yrs old. I later found they make it mop size.My next application, grout in kitchen floor will post at a later date."
4,Works well even on counter tops.,Takes the finger prints and greasy spots off appliances. It worked pretty well getting my glass top stove clean. The only draw back is that they fall apart after a few uses.I have used them for several years and am happy with the cleaning results.
3,Mr. Clean eraser,"I wasn't impressed with the quality of this product. It seems (to me) to fall apart too easily on difficult jobs like burned on food in an oven. Works, and that's the only reason I would recommend."
4,The good gets better,"Fresh off the success of their last hit album, ""Beatles For Sale,"" The Beatles are back in the studio producing ""Help!,"" ""Revolver,"" and ""Rubber Soul."" We hear various rehearsals from the ""Help!"" era, all of which are very good, especially the talking at the beginning about the song (the greatest moments in the set are when George asks Paul, ""What key is it in?"" before ""Yesterday"" and John's ""Sugar plum fairy, sugar plum fairy"" before ""A Day In The Life."") The live songs on disc 1 show evidence of the dying Beatlemania, and with new sounds and styles such as ""Norweigan Wood"" and ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" touring became boring for the Beatles. In 1966 they decided enough is enough, and we can hear on this album the bordom of the 1966 concerts. With tourin out of their way, they created ""Sgt. Pepper"" and ""Magical Mystery Tour,"" and we hear very early takes of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and ""A Day In The Life."" These are all very good and well-presented."
4,From 1965-1967-Better than Anthology 1!,"The first CD is great. ""Real Love"" is much better than ""Free As A Bird."" ""Tommorow Never Knows"",""I'm Looking Through You"",and ""I'm Only Sleeping"" sound wonderful. The second CD loses some energy. The three versions of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" are all pretty bad.""You Know My Name"" is much better (and funnier)! ""I Am The Walrus"" sounds stupid without the orchesta et al. The ""Sgt. Pepper"" outakes are okay. Buy it for the first CD"
1,Dangerous,"I fitted the Heavy Duty Grass Gator to my line trimmer. Started cutting some grass and hit a small rock. One of the plastic blades, along with its pin, broke away. Fortunately these parts flung out and away from me (and didn't hit anyone else)! In my opinion, this is a dangerous product! Not recommended!"
5,A High Quality Action Figure,"This is a highly detailed action figure. I purchased it as a collectible, because of its high quality and detail.It is exactly as advertised, if not better."
5,"um, wow. why am i the first person to review this?","well, probably because everyone already has it. i have the vinyl, i need the disc. it's beautiful in its complexity. treat yourself right, buy this."
5,Art and War,I used the book to help with a project for a Holocaust Memorial Project. It was invaluable in communicating what needs to be communicated in this most difficult subject.
2,Tis Pity She's a Whore,"I was reluctant to pick up this book because of the title, but I decided to read it because it was around. I was mildly entertained and finished the book very quickly due to the short length. It is a tragedy in which almost all are killed in the end. I did not care much for the plot, which involves an incestuous relationship between brother and sister. After reading the beginning, it was rather easy to predict the ending. It is not tremendously detailed or emotional. I'm not sure if this is a title that would often come up in conversations between friends or colleagues, but avid readers might want to pick up the title to have read it."
5,A Truly Great Devotional!,My husband and I have really enjoyed this book. The topics are relevant and thought provoking and there is a lot of scripture backing it up. One of the best things about it is that it really does take about 15 minutes to get through instead of those 3 minute devotionals that are so common. It means that you have to take that time to spend with each other and listen to what's being said and take time to reflect on it and talk about it. Just setting aside that time out of a busy day to concentrate on the Lord and each other has been invaluable to our marriage. I'm now buying the book to give a a wedding present!
2,Big Daddy Is Alright.,"These are the five matches on the tape: Diesel vs Bret Hart, vs Jeff Jarrett, vs King Kong Bundy, vs Owen Hart, and vs Shawn Micheals . The best match of the tape is Diesel against Bret Hart, would have been better if there was a winner and if the match wasn't edited twice throughout the match. This match was from, ""Royal Rumble '95"". Jeff Jarrett and the late Owen Hart are okay matches, nothing special except seeing Owen wrestle. The King Kong Bundy match was a dud. It would of been awesome if Diesel would of use his jackknife powerbomb to finish him off, but what a lame ending and its a very short match. The Shawn Micheals match is a pretty good match even though the match is edited once throughout the match. This match is from, ""WrestleMania10"". For those of you wondering who is Big Daddy Cool Diesel, he is Big Sexy Kevin Nash. This was a okay tape but it wasn't a good tape."
3,Helmet Noise Rock,"I heard a Deftones cover of ""Sinatra"", and I thought I would check out this album that came out before ""Meantime"", which is a great album. Their next album ""Betty"" is also a must-have. But this album is not very good, except for ""Blacktop"", and perhaps a couple other decent tracks. Page Hamilton's voice and the noise-rock factor can work against them sometimes, but Helmet is very capable of delivering some great heavy music."
5,Remastered Classic,"ORG did a tremendous job with this vinyl release. Already a classic, ""Strap It On"" has unfortunately suffered from a lackluster recording. Everything has been adjusted accordingly as Page's vocals and riffs along with the rhythm of John, Pete, and Henry now all shine through tightly during the nine tracks.It's loud, it's ugly, it's Helmet. And now their debut album sounds better than ever."
5,a highly underrated masterpiece,"wow. this album hits like a sledgehammer. the incredible, and very innovative riffing and screaming by helmet-frontman and mastermind page hamilton are quite impressive. while the cd doesn't seem very well produced but this just adds to the raw and aggressive sound. one of the greatest metal albums of the nineties. it's a shame that real great bands like helmet never get the attention they deserve"
2,Turn it off,"Shame to know the group was essentially a one trick pony from the get go, with only a few later releases able to do anything with what the rough debut attempts to lay down."
2,Cheap version,This turned out to be 18/0 weight flatware. This means that it feels like the cheap flatware available at discount stores all over the place. Disappointed as I bought it to add to the 18/8 flatware I already have. Quite a quality difference between the two versions.I'm keeping it as it costs a lot to ship back. The price I paid for this was much too high for the low quality. I wish I had known what I was getting. I would not have bought it.
3,oneida silverware,"Heavy and durable. Nice looking, but a little disappointed with the size of the larger spoons and forks. Hard to tell the larger ones from the smaller ones."
3,Don't waste your money,"I needed 32 lb. paper for creating tri-fold brochures on my color laser printer and had used Hammermill paper in the past. The Bowie-area Office Depot or Staples did not carry this specific brand, so I ordred it online. The shipping cost and the 7-day wait was a killer. The Hammermill paper is good, but I'll get another brand of 32 lb. paper locally from now on and save my money."
2,Lack of clear focus - not helpful after my miscarriage,The book contained a lot of information that I didn't need or want to hear about. The author goes into great detail about pregnancy and abortion but spends little time on spontaneous abortion. Some of the subjects were not comforting to me in the weeks following my miscarriage.
3,"As a Hadcore Fan 5 Stars, But Not For The Casual Fan","If you want to hear outakes and rare tracks by The Beatles because you are a big fan this will be great(like it was for me). But if you only casually listen to the band you would probably be better off with 1. And if you want to find out more about the bands history I would recomend the Anthology dvd's which is actually better than the cds in my opinion.And I would also like to state that I love Free As A Bird. I think people are to hard on it. I think it is a great song and even though John's voice isn't the clearest I like the way it sounds(very haughnting). After all let's not forget it cracked the top 20 on billboard, not bad for three old guys and someone who had died almost 15 years earlier."
5,Anthology 1-The Beatles,"The Beatles from their beginnings to around the ""Hard Day's Night"" period. It is great to hear some of their early, rare recordings. Their musical skills are evident from the start and this collection demonstrates their growth as song writers. That ""skiffle"" beat is nearly always present, if you listen closely, and what makes the music so infectious. ""Free As A Bird"" is the first song in the Anthology set and a powerful way of opening the series."
1,Great way to steal our money,"Don't get suckered into buying this. If these recordings had been previously rejected, it was for a good reason (yes, even if they are by the Fab Four!). Free As A Bird is a weak song and doesn't make purchasing an entire double album worthwhile. At the end of the day, it's just a way of squeezing money from unsuspecting beatlemaniacs."
3,Anthology 1,It's not the best thing. there's a lot of fuzzy songs and short speeches it wasn't that good... a lot of short songs
5,Anthology,"Well, I give 5 stars ONLY and ONLY for Free as a Bird, which stands along with Dear Prudence, Come Together and other great masterpieces... it is just amazing how they managed to create such a great song having just an old tape with Lennon singing!... Also Leave My Kitten Alone deserves some attention... surprising it wasn't on Please Please Me or With THe Beatles... the problem is that without these two songs the Anthology isn't worth a penny, for it is a compilation of early performances, some of them even featuring Pete Best, so if you feel like spending 30$ on some history, go ahead, for those who expect something new and of good quality, better find Free as a bird single and you wouldn't be dissapointed..."
3,More compilation than rare versions,"This album is a lovely compliation of the early Beatles but really the songs haven't been changed much. There are live versions, which just have a bit of audience noise on them, demos and early takes which have John changing some lyrics and if your lucky a few different arrangements. Apart from the very first bit with recordings before they became big this doesn't really have anything new. Free as a Bird is nice but if you want it get the single."
4,"Not for the casual fan, but a real treat for diehards","The Beatles' Anthology 1 is not a greatest hits collection, let me get that out of the way right now, the essence of Anthology is that you basically have a front row seat in the beatles' story of going from a rag tag boy band sensation to the greatest artists in rock music. Anthology 1 is not ear candy, but it shows the Beatles's on their way to success with some pretty good live performances. Free As a Bird is also quite a good song, if you're a beatles fan, you'll love this record, if you're just getting into the Beatles, go with 1962-1966 and 1967-1970, those are their greatest hits collections and are great ones at that. A1 is good, but for diehards only."
5,"A far cry from the Duran Duran we know and love, but GREAT","I'd say only two of the songs on this album are god-awful (which is a pretty good ""good song ratio""). The best ones of the CD are ""Big Bang Generation,"" ""Electric Barbarella,"" ""Be My Icon,"" ""So Long Suicide,"" ""Midnight Sun"" and ""Meddazaland."" The rest are either Okay or GOD-AWFUL. These songs listed here are great, and it's great to see Duran Duran still keeping 'em coming. A good CD...a bit strange, but good...."
4,good enough 4 me,"well,i think duran are a very talented group,and therefore i gave 4 stars. butnot all the songs on here are that great like silva halo,& midnight sun. i do however find myself singing along to great songs like big bang generation,electric barbarella,and even undergoing treatment! so it's worth the dough pick up a copy today!"
3,I missed John Taylor...,"This album is pretty good, but DD just don't sound the way they used to since John Taylor left. Some of the songs on this album just left me feeling, well, kinda confused. I do like Electric Barbarella and Out of My Mind. The first time I heard Out Of My Mind on the radio, I knew it was DD even though I didn't even know they had a new album out. I guess I just like the more ""vintage"" sound..."
4,good,I am happy with the flatware. However when they say big they mean big. I'm not used to it yet. Some pieces were scratched prob. from shipping. All in all a great value.
5,One of the greatest childrens books ever.,My mom must have read this book a 1000 times. I am 24 and my brother and I have some of our best memorys in that book. It sparked a desire to read that hasnt stoped yet. Funny and creative and pleanty of charecters delight even those who are TOO MATURE to read childrens books
4,Pretty good and worth the buck.,"This is the fourth book I've read now on my chess defense quest. The first three being ""The Art of Defense in Chess"" by Soltis and the same title by Poluevsky and the third ""How to Defend in Chess"" by Colin Crouch. The first one by Soltis is the best in my opinion, followed by the reviewed book by Marin and then Poluevsky. Save your money on Crouch's book, it's not about defense at all, it is just a collection of Lasker and Petrosian's games where most the time they are attacking! Anyway, to the book at hand.As another reviewer mentioned the biblical quotes to start sections is really cheesy, lame, and kind of stupid, but the book content itself is good. A few chapters like the last two on Endings and Resigning early are more about not quitting than defensive themes, but all the other chapters on defensive sacrifices, using the king, etc are pretty good and easy to read. I don't regret the purchase and it is hard to do that with Mihail Marin."
2,Much better than what is already out there,"James Chace does a great job in listing all kinds of facts and anecdotes about Dean Acheson and his contributions to American Cold War policy. (I think that his book is the only true comprehensive biography on Mr. Acheson out there, too.)"
1,Give your back a rest,"Not only did I have to read large portions of this book for a class, but I also had to carry it around (which gave my back an unnecessary workout). The beginning of the book was interesting. But then it became complicated and boring. There were too many details."
4,"Great book, though not quite up to par with the first","This sequel to ""I, Claudius"" goes into depth about the actual reign of Claudius, as opposed to the reigns of his familial predecessors and his eventual ""rise"" to power. If you did not enjoy the first book, don't bother with this one. It is only interesting to those who want to learn more about Claudius. For those who do, you will not be disappointed."
5,Claudius the idiot - warning - spoiler alert in review,"I'm writing this review because I'm completely baffled by this otherwise excellent novel's ending.At the end of this novel (SPOILER ALERT) Claudius decides to let Messelina put Lucius (aka Nero) next in line for the next emperor. Claudius/Graves rationalizes that Nero will be such a bad emperor that the people will have no choice but to reinstate the republic.This is the most idiotic logic imaginable, and it is out of character. All through the novel Claudius has shown himself brisk and firm in decision making. Claudius was perfectly capable of retiring and re-instating the republic, and yet he (according to Graves) chose not to do so because he felt that Rome needed a really bad emperor first!So, the novel was spoilt for me.Can someone please explain why Claudius behaved so uncharacteristically and bizarrely at the end of this novel? Otherwise, this masterpiece novel is ruined for me."
1,Don't buy this copy,"On recieving the copy of SUNFLOWER,from AMAZON.COM, produced by ""New Star Video"" I immediatly felt that I am in for a surprise, as the cover intrigued me. [...] It is also a shame that the photography of a great artist the like of Giuseppe Rotunna ASC found itself so degraded that I could not even keep watching it. The film is also jumpy. I am sure it is either a pirate copy or if it is a legal copy, such quality should not be be put on the market. Do we know enough about New Star Video. [...]"
2,Poor Reception,"I replace an old ""1970s"" Wards clock radio with this Sony Dream Machine expecting great things. I live out in the country about 40 miles from my favorite AM stations. The Wards received the AM stations loud and clear, the Sony barely gets one station. The Wards received 5 FM stations fairly well, the Sony none. I will say the speakers produce much better sound that the Wards, but the constant on lighted display gets annoying at night, especially if you like a dark room but still want to see the time."
4,Three alarms in ONE,"I am glad they I was able to find an alarm clock that coordinated with my scuedule. I work full time night and go to school full time in the day. I really needed a reliable alarm clock. Not only is this alarm clock reliable it is easy to change the time on the alarm; you don't have to scroll through, you can change the hour and then the minutes. WORKS GREAT!! Would recommend for an active, time demated lifestyle."
4,I like it,"The item is quite good. It only lacks the ability to distinguish week days from weekends, I have waken up on a saturday because I forgot to turn the alarm of. The CD is good, the radio also, and the buzzer. I like very much the individual alarms with every mode of the clock (one alarm for the CD, one for the radio and one for the buzzer)."
2,"Sensitive machine, worked for only a year","We used this in a room with a humidifier and it often stopped working b/c it was affected by the humidity in the room. (We were surprised by this b/c the humidifier wasn't all that strong.) Unfortunately, the dream machine CD player part recently quit working - it only lasted for about a year and a half."
1,Clock Dial Disappears When you Lie Down,"Aside from the somewhat bulky styling, my only complaint about this product is that the digital LCD display becomes invisible as your viewpoint lowers to eye-level. Visibility is fine as long as the unit is below your vantage point. My bedside table is almost as high as my bed, and with the added height of this radio, the digital readout totally disappears when I put my head on the pillow! To check the time, I have to lift my head UP out of the pillow in order to see the readout. This is the case on all three brightness settings. BTW, even the lowest brightness setting is still rather bright, which might be an annoyance for some.I was happy with this unit in all other respects, though. As it is, I can't use it. It's going back to BestBuy."
2,Unreadable display from the bed!,"This is a decent Sony product in terms of features, but they missed the boat on this one completely. This is an alarm clock that is supposed to sit by the bedside. Given that, one would expect the time to be readable from the bed. Not so. If your nightstand is even slightly higher than the bed, as many are, you cannot read the time without lifting up you're head. Bad R&D from Sony! Just terrible."
2,Not for kids,Did everything you would want but stand up to the daily use of a two year old. In short order he broke it so that very few of the buttons or clock worked.
5,Dracula Doesn`t Drink Lemonde By Nicholle,"Do you like mysteries because you will like this one! The name of the book is Dracula Doesn`t Drink Lemonade. The author is Debbie Dadey and Marcia Thornton Jones. The characters are Liza, Melody, Eddie, Ben, Huey, Howie, Mr.Drake, and Principal Davis. The mystery takes place at Bailey School. Liza and Melody really told Ben to stop fighting with Huey. What partly happens is their principal tells them to go to the nurse's office. Liza and Melody are in shock because Ben is faking he is sick! Do you think Mr.Drake is really a Dracula? Do you think Mr. Drake really pushed Ben? Read the book to find out."
4,cool gun,This a good light gun. the shotgun reload at the bottom is really cool. The downside is it seems like it's made a little cheep. However it seems to work just fine. bottom line how many light gun games are there 4 mabey only to I can think of house of the dead and silent scope so considering that how much are you really going to be using it. Great buy works just fine shotgun reload is awesome. some your your self some money and just get this one...o yeah there isn't really a laser sight like in the picture.
3,"OK, but not great.",Cameta Camera service was great.Bag is well made. Could use a little more padding.Strap is too narrow and bag is difficult to open and close.Very balky.
5,Aaron Neville,Great CD. I always enjoy listening to his music. I did get a chance to see him live some years back and have always enjoyed his music.
5,True Soul,"Nothing beats the voice of Aaron Neville, These songs are absolute classics and Aaron has made them his own. This album just lifts you off your chair."
4,"In no way educational, but FUN nevertheless!","I bought this for my 3.5 year old daughter and 9.5 year old niece, and the game was a hit! It's really funny to see their reactions when they draw a card!There's gross pieces that you stick inside Ned's Head, such as a dirty diaper, bird poop with a worm, different insects, 'smelly' sock, vomit, etc... and theirs cards that match the pieces. You draw a card and have to search for THAT piece inside Ned's Head... either via his ears or his nose. It's pretty funny to see the kids' reactions and makes for lots of laughs!Although this game isn't educational at all, it's still a lot of fun. I enjoy educational games as much as the next person, but sometimes you need those ""pointless"" games :)"
4,Really Fun Game,"My 4 year old loves this game. He asked for it for his birthday, and we couldn't find it anywhere in department stores. Of course, it was on Amazon, and he just loves it."
5,"Very Fun, Very Different Game for boys and girls","This game is so cool my kids will not put it down. I have a 4 yr old boy, 5 yr old girl, and 7 year old boy that just love to play this game together. The kids stick their hands in Ned's ears and nose and pull out weird things like fake barf, aliens, all sorts of stuff. The soft head makes it safe to play with and my kids like to wear it on their heads. This game is easy to store- Everything gets folded up and put right back in the box. I love this game because it gives all of my kids something to do together that isn't too challenging for my young one but cool enough for my oldest. Your kids will have fun with it too! It's on my shopping list for my nieces and nephews!"
3,Package had been opened.,"I'm hoping that this product will be alright. The package on arrival had been opened, the box was not square as if the contents had been repacked and taped back up. I didn't open again because it was a gift that I was sending off right away. When purchasing products in stores I alway avoid things that have been repackaged but had no choice with this. I would have returned it unopened but there wasn't enough time to select another gift."
4,You Have Neither The Technology Nor Steady Hands...,"I went into this movie with less than zero expectations. I admit, I typically run screaming from movies of this genre. They are usually stupid to the point of missing comedy entirety (ex: any of the American PIe schlock). Superbad, however, turned out to be surprisingly funny. This film redeemed the ""teenage comedy"" genre. With a message that reaches beyond the enormity of its sophomoric humor, Superbad will leave the viewer with a good feeling of entertainment. I wish this movie had been marketed differently and perhaps it would have reached an even wider audience. Let us not downplay the rampant profanity and sexual innuendo that pervades this film. But come on, it's about three, not-so-cool, high school seniors. And oh yeah, it's called FICTION for a reason. Watch it for what it is and ENJOY!"
4,"Superbad, super funny, super raunchy, super innocent","The Judd Apatow comedy machine scores again! There's just something innocent and fresh about this very raunchy comedy about the eternal teen quest for sex. Innocent and raunchy? Yes. Face it teen boys are obsessed with sex in a way that everything around them is a reminder of what they aren't getting. This movie captures that youthful obsession and the naive fumblings of the frankly geeky heroes. Where other comedies of this ilk wear their raunchiness as a kind of creepy perverted badge worn by popular jocks and rich boys whose deflowering is so inevitable as to have no mystery or tension, these boys seem destined to be virgins. How can they possibly attain their goal? Their adventure is all the more human because of it, and as such the raunch factor becomes an extension of their innocence.Jonah Hill and Michael Cera give star making performances!"
5,great comedy for Guys,I bought this for my husband. He saw it on cable and wanted to own it. It is a funny movie but once was enough for me. More guy humor I guess.
1,This Is One Stinky Movie,"After hearing all the hype, I decided to buy the Blu-ray version of Superbad without seeing it in the theater first. It was on sale so I figured, what the heck? Big mistake! This movie really stinks! I was expecting something more like Revenge Of The Nerds and all I got was this unfunny piece of garbage. Save your money on this one."
4,"Supergood. Ho ho, has anyone said that yet?","Those cops were funny, weren't they? I mean, really funny. This film is a sad indictment of the archaic alcohol laws you have there in the Land of the Free. Here in Ireland, the milkman brings around liquor(or ""drink"" as we call it here) and delivers it to your door (if you pay in advance). Have you learned nothing in the last 300 years? Sigh."
1,"STUPID, STUPID.",THIS IS A STUPID VULGER MOVIE. THE PRODUCER MUST HAVE TAKEN FILM MAKING CLASSES FROM KEVIN SMITH OR MAYBE ROGER CORMAN. IT IS STUPID AND VULGER AND SHOULD BE BANNED FROM THEATERS.
1,never got it,even after sending them an e-mail confirming my cancelation they told me it was already sent. even after canceling it through amazon. still never got my DVD even after sending them the correct address.
2,it was allllllright.,the fat guy got annoying quick.he had some lines and bits but after a while i just wished hed die.the plot is basic ''virgin male nerds attempting to bang dream girl before shipping out to college'' movie with a ton of cursing tossed in (thank you annoying fat guy !!!!!!).im sure the ''unrated'' version will be snapped up by those who can relate.
5,Excellent investment!,"Oneida brings the same lovely design and balance of its silverware to its stainless patterns. The set I've used for more than 30 years still looks great; the traditional pattern has harmonized with a wide assortment of dinnerware. The size of each piece is ideal: nice long knife blade; good distinction between dinner and salad forks; rounded edges that feel good in the hand. (After using these you start to notice that some other stainless utensils don't have as nice a feel, size, or color.) This set will retain beauty and quality the you can enjoy ""everyday"" for years to come.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
4,CNJ,"Oneida True Rose is a constant good value. I have gone through many sets. It is not the higher quality you buy by the placesetting but for my family and its rough and tumble use, it is perfect. I heard from a department store in my area it is no longer being made. Looks like Amazon is selling the last of their sets. Timing is everything..I'm buying 2 sets when it ismarked for One day sales or Friday Sales...it is a great buy for the money...buy don't expect it to last forever, get a clue, see the price..its a value not something you put in your will for your grandchildren."
5,Masterpieces,"Doris Day's most outstanding two albums (and that's saying something for a singer who was and is a perfectionist) on one C.D. The songs, arrangements, sound quality and Doris' performances rank among the best album achievements of all time. Both albums were sensational successes when they were released and remain as starry-shiny as ever. You'll listen to them over and over and over and over."
5,handy little things,"Just recently, We had planted vines in our office building and as the plants grew, they weren't attaching themselves to the walls so I found these on amazon. I received the package fast and started sticking these on the walls and sure enough, the vines started clinging."
5,Super cd,This is a great cd. It has three versions of Story To Tell including the instrumental and a cappella (vocals only) versions. You can tell Kurupt and Snoop had fun recording this. This cd also has four versions of the song Xchange performed by rapper Typhoon. One is a rock/rap with the hard rock band Fencekiller that completely blows away the Fred Dirsch/Method Man song. The rap version of Xchange takes you on tour thru L.A. A definite hit. I recommend this.
3,A bit more imagination would be nice...,I've been a regular with this serie and got most of the previous albums and was usually quite pleased with them - it sort of renewed classical house with a funk approach. But this latest album is a bit stale and shows redundancy. Still there are still a few tracks that make it work. I bought the album in France and it had a bonus cd (mixed tracks) but it didn't had much to the compilation. Recommanded if your new to urban music or looking for a nice substitute to overcooked lounge...
4,Read this book before going to Cambodia!,"The safety tips are outstanding. In depth coverage of every region of the country. The only reason I didn't take it with me to Cambodia was that Lonely Planet had more phone numbers of places to stay and I lost the included map of Cambodia that comes with this book. If this book had had printed in it a map of the entire country, then this would have been the book I would have taken. Great read before going however!"
1,"Out of date, not all that great.","The book I received in July, 2006 was published in 2004 - NOT 2005, as indicated. It doesn't contain contain any information that you can't get from other guidebooks - and the information on specific sites is sketchy. Maybe it is useful if you plan on touring on a motorcycle, but otherwise, there are more current guidebooks covering the same places more effectively."
1,Not a great book for beginers.,"Even though the title says teach yourself Arabic, I personally found resources on the internet that were more helpful and clearer to understand than in this book. No phonetics are used, and most is just in Arabic with English next to it, How would one know how to pronounce these words without some idea of how they sound. ""Phonetics"" I was not crazy about this one, more for advanced than beginners in Arabic."
1,It's not what it claims to be.,My first attempt using this tool ended in failure. The blade snapped off while I was cutting a hedge branch no larger than 1.5 inches. This aside the tool probably performs adequately if it were not for the flimsy cutting blade
3,Great fit and sound but poor weather resistance.,These headphones fit well and have a good sound sensitivity so you don't have to turn the volume up very high on your mp3 player like you do with other units. My problem with them is that they don't hold up well if you expose them to moisture. I wear them when mowing or working in the yard and after a few weeks the volume starts decreasing and will eventually go out all together until they are allowed to dry out. I'm going to try a set of the Panasonics from Amazon and see if they hold up better.
1,"Horrible fit, terrible sound, not a great design...","I was very hopeful that these would be the sports headphones for me, but was sad to find that they did not stay in place on my ears or offer the quality sound I was looking for. As a female, I found the ear pieces too large to hook my ear sufficiently, and they just couldn't stay put on my ears. Every time I moved my head from side to side (even minimally) the inner bud would slip out of my ears or the hook would slip completely off my ear - not good for those long walking/jogging sessions. Also, in my opinion, the sound was really quite ""tinny"" and not as clear/rich as I had hoped it would be. And the sad excuse for a ""clip"" would not even stay on my thinnest t-shirt - total waste! I really expected better from Sony, but I find myself still searching for those perfect headphones."
4,Best Headphones I've Found For Working Out,"At the outset, these headphones do not have outstanding sound quality. If you were sitting at your desk listening to music, you would probably want more comfortable headphones that deliver better sound. With that being said though, these are the best headphones that I've found for working out. I actually prefer the foldable over the head style headphones, but they unfortunately seem to break too often. I've had my pair of these guys for many months now though, and they've held up great. I have no problem with them staying in my ears when I'm working out either, and I have rather large ears. I don't know if women would have a harder time keeping these in because of their hair, but I don't see why these shouldn't do the trick for guys. The cord is also a good length - not too long, not to short. All in all, if you're looking for a good pair of headphones for the gym, its definitely worth trying these out."
1,Too small for large ears,"I have large ears, so maybe I should have expected headphones designed like this to probably not fit. So bottom line... if you have large ears, don't get these."
3,Average Over-Ear Headphones,"These Sony 'Sport' Over-Ear Headphones are your average headphones. I use them primarily for my 5th Gen iPod when I work out and go on a run. I purchased these as a cheap replacement because I had lost my original iPod earbuds. First, they do not sound spectacular, in fact, they sound a little muffled when compared to the stock iPod earbuds. They do not come with any foamy cushions and its just a hard plastic earbud connected to an over-the-ear 'hook'. I have a medium sized ear and ear canal and the sony earpiece fit just right into the entrance of my ear canal, but the over-the-ear hook piece was too big for my ear. The portion that was supposed to hook over my ear wasn't very secure. When jumping around during a workout they would come lose. Unfortunately, that piece of the headphone is hardplastic and I could not flex it into a more secure fit.They're cheap and they get the job done."
1,Durability,"If you want headphones that will last you longer, this is a bad one. After a while, one of the earbuds would stop working and then the other will stop working. I am on my third one and am surprised at how quickly it breaks."
2,"Great songs, BUT...","Every longtime Chris LeDoux fan knows and loves these great songs, but this CD is just another in a too-long line of Chris collections issued by Capitol/Liberty: best of, greatest hits (as much as I love Chris LeDoux, he didn't have any hits), early years, box sets, etc. A year and a half after Chris' death, the record company is still putting out more compilations (""Anthology"" and the forthcoming ""Ultimate Collection""). What about some unreleased material?!"
5,Wood Working,"The book I purchased provides simple plans and details to enable the average ""hobby"" enthusiast to produce reasonable quality wooden toys, the type which is fairly hard to find and if found the purchase prices are some what ""exquisite"" to say the least.This is a great little book well worth the investment amount paid"
4,woodwn toys,"I have used this book for 5 years and have made most of the toys in this book and have been selling them at craft shows and they sell very good. but the best thing is I learned alot about how to build other toys. I would recommend this book to anyone. I have made them out of pine, oak, mahonany, black walnut and birch."
4,excellent,"This is the kind of book that can be a mentor to women young and not so young. ""Mama"" in the story is the kind of woman eveyone wants to know and be like. Very good book."
5,One of the Best Dog Books I Own,"This book is a very good book to own. My favorite things about it are the list of breeds, the questions to ask breeders/shelters, the winning dogs, and the dog careers. It only has around 250 dog breeds, and I know there are more then 3,000, but it still is a must buy for people who will own dogs (are getting them) and people who want advice."
5,"""Definitive"" indeed!",You do not need any other book but this one for all your dog-related queries and concerns. It was a great book before I got my dog and it continues to be a vital source of information as my dog ages. A must-have for dog owners and fanciers!
4,First read it in junior high,"I was about twelve when I first read this book. At the time it was very confusing and seemed really stupid to me. Now, I'm in college and I've read it again and again. I never figured out why it was essential to the Tillerman series, but it was good to learn about Dicey's grandmother when she had her family. Now, a reader can see that there was someone who knew about Liza and Dicey living on Cape Cod. I was proud of Bullet for not telling his brutal father about Liza's whereabouts. Like I said, it seemed really stupid when I was twelve, but now that I'm older, I really appreciate it."
2,the runner that listens to no one,"Bullet is a runner on the school track team. Infact, he's the best runner of them all. He doesn't give in to anyone's orders. Not his father or his coach. When Bullet is asked to train Tamer Shipp, he says no. Later, he befriends him. Back home, his father always tries to box him in and Bullet's mother is also boxed in by his father. Bullet has tried ways to jump out. And now he's finally 18. Bullet decides to drop out of school to go to war leaving his mother with a red boat and 100 dollars."
2,"Not that great, I'm afraid...","Their first album is a glossy-pop classic, full of hooks and interesting production twists. Unfortunately for all, the new one is a shallower version of that. Certainly, the first album was used as a formula for this, but all the clever inventiveness is gone.Even more damaging, there are no amazing catchy songs as on the first record. Hooks and melodies are in evidence, but nothing as universally appealing as the first.Their sexual attitudes were a help/hindrance before, now it's no real issue. They still HAVE an attitude, but it's less well-produced than before. Get the first record!"
1,Not Good by a Long Shot,"I bought this album because the first one was interesting. This one sucks. What is worse is that you can't take an album back once you've opened it. I would not recommend this to anyone. There was one song that drove me bananas, Cosmos. What were they thinking. Fortunately for them, the only song I liked was No. 2. The only song written by The Veronica's. Maybe this group should go about getting The Veronica's to write all their songs because those girls are more talented than anything out right now. T.A.T.U does not write their own music, maybe they should start because their writers are screwing their career. They can't afford to make another album like this, they will be a thing of the distant past, if remembered at all."
2,does not reach its potential,"After their gleaming cross over success with ""200 km/h in the Wrong Lane"" Tatu comes back and delivers a much weaker sophomore album. If you have been hooked on the first CD, chances are you will appreciate some of the stuff on this one too. ""All About Us"", ""Loves Me Not"", ""We Shout"", ""Obezyanka Nol"" and ""Dangerous and Moving"" strike a familiar cord, but the rest of the tracks are nothing more than forgetable, pop-striving junk. I guess I expected more innovation from Tatu, but why should I even be disappointed; these are the very same girls who have lied about their sexuality to boost and promote album sales.....(how disappointing)....I wish them well; I just hope they are more honest and original next time - you can't keep on fooling your fans and expect to get away with it....Overall, this does not reach its potential...."
5,Finally....a Practical Book for Classroom Use!!,"I've read a lot of books for perfecting classroom practice but there are few that provide teachers with the actual ""nuts and bolts"" practicality that new teachers need. Literacy teachers who need a handle on the workshop model (both reading and writing) need look no further than ""Workshops that Work"". Having had the privilege to work alongside both these teachers and see them in action, I can tell you firsthand that they've managed to capture their classroom magic on the printed page- this is a tome that can stand proudly next to books by Calkins, Fletcher, Robb and other experts in the field!"
4,ANOTHER FORGOTTON WINNER FROM SECADA !!!!!!!!!!,"Here's another overlooked and underated joy by one of the most talented singers of our time. JON SECADA'S AMOR is a romantic journey of sound that is really quite gorgeous to the ears; much like JON is to the eyes. His lush multi-textured voice soulfully croons through these thoughtful songs that would be ideal to enjoy for numerous occasions; especially a long intimate evening with someone that you truely love. The songs are beautifully constructed and are hauntingly emotive in the residue of feelings that they will inspire in your listening experience. AMORE'S another fine work from JON SECADA, and due yourself a favor and be blessed by this man's amazing voice."
3,"Good, but they can do better.","It would not be a good idea to acquire this album if you are only beginning to know the early works of the Bee Gees. Go and buy Horizontal or Idea instead. I find this album to be more for completists who love the music of the Bee Gees and want more, even if they are risking to buy a record where only four or five songs are worth listening more than a couple of times.It starts with ""How can you mend a broken heart"", but that #1 song - and ""Dont wanna live inside myself"", the other single from the record - can be found in any decent compilation. Without those two, three gems remain in Trafalgar: the title song, a solid song with Maurice in vocals, Going back to waterloo, the closing song, and the EXCELLENT ""Lion in winter"". The rest of the album is too soft and sugary. They can do better."
4,"Bravo, Satoshi Kon!","I have loved and enjoyed anime for many years. Rarely does an anime film come along that breaks all the rules and shows you what true craftsmanship and creativity are. This is one of those rare gems.I had no expectations when I bought this other than it won a big award in Japan. The blending of history and drama was flawless, the characters equally so. It is a story within a story within a story. The animation is superb. I would not at all be surprised if this is being pushed into a live action movie it is that good.Another example that Disney does not own the market on animated films. I cant wait to buy ""Perfect Blue."""
5,excellent anime,"Definitely the best anime I've seen in a while. Good on the first view and the more you watch it the more subtlties you pick up, the use of black and white for certain scenes, what is in fact real and what's not. Really worth a look and definitely comparable to the likes of Ghost in the Shell and Spirited Away."
3,Blades stick,"We bought 2 Corona Clipper 1-inch capacity Bypass Pruners #BP 3180, and at first were very happy with the pruners. The problem with both of the pruners is that after a bit of use the blades get somewhat sticky and the spring is not strong enough to automatically re-open the blades. This becomes quite time consuming to have to either manually re-open the blades or to constantly have to remove the sticky from the blades and re-oil them. This greatly increases the maintenance required for the pruners compared to other pruners we have used. I will probably try to return both pruners."
3,Fine translation: Extremely Annoying Notes,"This book's translation is fine. However, I would not recommend this book to people with excellent French who would like to read Lacan in the original. Nor would I especially recommend it to women who are annoyed with Lacan and have had affairs with French literary critics. I find the Notes condescending."
1,Shockingly Poor Translation of Seminar XX,"Shockingly poor translation of Seminar XX. Fink seems to be so indecisive in making simple translation options that he burdens the text with almost arbitrary options (including making up new words!). Lacan already has a bad reputation for being obscure, why Fink thought it would do him justice by making him more obscure is incomprehensible. Better to learn French than bother to slog through this terrible translation. Jacqueline Rose's older translation of key passages in ""Feminine Sexuality"" (Norton, 1982) is far better."
2,Mattel could put out whatever it wants and it still sells...,regardless of how poorly made. The hair is horrible and the clothes are shabby. (It) could be better made.
4,No Problems...,My Daughter BEGGED for this last Christmas and I had already bought most of her gifts and was hesitant to pay full price after reading the durablility reivew...but it went on Clearance around her bday in May and I got it for her- Other than the hair being snarled (a problem with ALL Barbies) she is in great shape- nothing has broken... the only other issue is the stockings are VERY hard to get on- but my daughter still likes her... doesn't use the stand much (she is 4).. but still very pretty.
2,BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!,"I should caveat this review with the fact that I am a big heavy metal fan, and was also extremely pleased with Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven, but Pantera's latest offering with the exception of a few songs is an extreme dissapointment, while the energy is still there the creativity and song essence is not. If your looking for great new heavy metal with a lot of aggresive power, creativity, and fantastic songs...check out bands like Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, and Emperor...you wont be dissapointed ! These bands blow away Pantera!"
2,Reinventing nothing as usual,"Well alright Pantera still has this massive elephant stomping sound. Ok, guitars are crunching, vocals are ripping. But where are the songs ? Everything on this album is so in your face that it gets boring after the first three songs. It is just unbelievable that the stuff displayed here is the only music that those guys could write within 2 years. At least ""Trendkill"" showed some blues influences which were very welcomed... Is this band completly dumb or do they think that their fans just need to hear the same thing over and over again."
5,THE BEAST IS UNLEASHED,"For the ignorant a-holes who gave this cd 1 star and were talkinsh** about it can go to hell.The Cowboy's From Hell have neverbeen so hell like and redneck as on this.This cd is brutal andkicks Vulgar Display Of Power's ass.Revolution is my name,GoddamnEllectric,We'll that axe for a long time,Uplift,It makes them di-sappear,and I'll cast a shadow hold their own with classics like5 min alone,Becoming,Pshyco Holiday,Theros of rejection,Walk,ThisLove,e.t.c.So if you don't like this great,raw assault of southbred heavy metal than you can kiss my ass.Pantera are the def ofeverything that are good."
1,dont buy from this seller,Never received the item i purchased. Luckily amazon reimbursed me for the full amount of the sale. Don't but from this seller!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointing,"I got this album during a college prize giveaway, and all I can say is that I'm glad I didn't go out and buy it. I think Pantera is a talented metal band and their Cowboys from Hell and Vulgar Display of Power albums are timeless metal masterpieces...but this album does not impress me in the least. I've actually tried selling this album at some used CD stores, and none of them will buy it because they have too many copies of it. Apparently, not many people cared for this album, either. So, for the time being, I'm stuck with it. For great Pantera albums, this is not the one to check out. Check out anything before this one."
2,Huh?,"I LOVED Cowboys From Hell and Vulger Display Of Power, but this alblum was missing something, I'm not sure what, but something. It just wasn't as exciting or interesting to listen to as thier last two releases."
3,"HEAVY, but not very ""sticky"" . . .","Every Pantera record rams you in the gut, and this one is no exception. But ""Reinventing the Steel"" lacks the memorable solos and chunky riffs that punctuated ""Vulgar"" and ""Driven."" Those records are what I call ""sticky"" -- with every listen, more subtleties rise to the surface and the songs imbed themselves in your psyche. ""Reinventing the Steel"" doesn't have the same stickiness. The riffs and rhythms assault you without burying you, and that's a major flaw -- Pantera fans ultimately want the avalanche to bury them, not just wash over them.Pantera self-produced this disc, and perhaps the lack of an impartial ear in the studio hurt the band's ability to discern between great songs and songs that merely rock. Maybe ""Steel"" merely needs more time to brew and percolate, but you know when a record is the sh**, and this just ain't it."
2,The Decline Continues,"I've been listening to these guys for ten years now and it's been painful to watch the slow death of a band. Darrell totally limits himself to feedback and distorted solos that pale in comparison to the earlier solos that made you stare at your stereo in amazement (i.e.- a new level). pantera's best moments have always been when darrell and vinnie plow through everything in their path. but on this album they never really open the songs up. it's like somebody told them ""you can't go five seconds without having vocals. the only improvement is phil, who doesn't make the cd uninintelligible and unlistenable by screaming endlessly like on TGSTK. As a whole, all the years off have done one thing, and that's put the other foot in the grave. Pantera's done."
3,If you can buy only one Pantera disc....,"...uh, don't buy this one. This CD isn't necessarily bad, but it's not Pantera's best work in my opinion. If you want heavy, RTS has it in spades, with no letup. There are some interesting moments, but after about the fourth or fifth time through all the songs sound the same. Best moments: ""Goddamn Electric,"" ""Revolution Is My Name,"" ""Hellbound,"" and ""We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time."" In about that order.As for that one Pantera disc, if it has to be only one, get Vulgar Display of Power."
3,Just fine,"It works great for most games. Only problem I had was with the Tiger Woods golf games. It's hard to hit straighy shots, too much play in lever, and sometimes the zooming out doesm""t work right, but for other games it works fine."
2,The Intimate Jim Reeves,This MP3 download has only 3 songs by Jim Reeves. The other song aren't even the songs listed. They sound like they are sung by Doris Day. Don't waste your money.
5,SWEET EDGE,"I've never heard of them until lately.If you like catchy melodies, sweet music and some edge to your music... this is the blonde redhead album to buy. Their earlier albums are raw, less friendly, and less catchy. This album fits into the Cocteau Twins/Sugar Cubes category.If you're looking for harder stuff like Artic Monkeys, don't buy this album.Gems: Dr Strangeluv, S.W., 23, Silently, My Impure Hair."
3,I love you...less,"Known for their jagged No Wave rock, Blonde Redhead has transformed (like a butterfly) into something else entirely. The rough (innovative) edges have been replaced by something satiny smooth and overproduced. ""Pretty"" songs have taken the place of the type of interesting, challenging and quirky material found on ""Damaged Lemons"" and other early albums."
3,FACES FOCUSES ON BERRY'S STRONG VOICE,"FACES is a pleasant foray into nineties contemporary country, distinguished by Berry's strong vocals. While up-tempo tunes like ""She's Taken a Shine"" and ""Love is Everything' are certainly noteworthy, it's the ballads that most utilize Berry's voice: CHANGE OF MIND, I WILL IF YOU WILL (with Patty Loveless), FAITHFULLY, 40 AGAIN and I GIVE MY HEART. Production is clean and supportive...recommended for Berry fans and country music lovers who appreciate good singers."
4,don't kiss my a$$ then,"We never asked for the attention that we have received from everybody. I guess just some people have come to realize how challenging our job really is. But we do not expect a pat on the back for it, Because we do realize that is our job. Just remember that one day you might need one of us to come in and save your a$$, then one day you might appreciate what we do. but know worry I will not expect you to kiss my a$$ at all, because I can speak for all fireman, police, & E.M.S we are not that type of people we are just ""doing our job""."
5,SUPER BOOK!,"As an Events Planner, there are a great deal of information in this book. I really love it and have highly recommended!"
1,B-Sides,"I got this in a package with all the other ""Sedated in the 80s"" volumes. For explanation, the liner notes of the CD says that these are all B-sides of otherwise famous songs.They are B-sides for good reason. Growing up in the 80s, I can safely say I never heard any of these songs, save the original version of Berlin's ""No More Words"". This one has the extended dance remix... which is for serious Berlin fans only, all 2 of you out there."
4,Great movie but massively edited for DVD,"I first watched this powerful movie on two VHS cassettes five years ago. Since then, it's come out on DVD. Unfortunately, there were, in my view, many significant editing cuts to get the film on one disc that really take away from some of the subtle scenes that make the movie great. The DVD is still good, but loses some steam from the original version...It would be nice to see movies this special reproduced in their entirety."
2,Disappointed.,This book reads like one long advertisment for Montgomery and her Sports balm to which she dedicated several pages.It is awkward to read a text where the author refers to herself in the 3rd person: The montgomery method this and The montgomery method that over and over again.Her 12 step program is covered in very few pages is very insubstancial (although it might actually work. I have not tried it yet).Too much Ego.AGL
4,Goodness,"This album is definately what I would term a grower. Magnetic fields was always one of those groups I meant to check out but for whatever reason didn't until last April. Then, while browsing the racks at my local CD store, I noticed a copy of this for about 8 dollars, so I thought, eh, why not? The album is very poppy, in an almost smarmy manner. The lyrics are just this side of sappy, "" I'm taking a ride to somewhere inside, where you never left and I never cried"" which can get old. On the other hand, the guy can be quite funny "" On a ferris wheel, looking out on Coney Island, under more stars than there are prostitutes in Thailand."" Clever, no? People say his voice takes some getting use to, but it doesn't bother me, in fact, I like his voice. Kind of like a cross between Calvin Johnson and Ian Curtis. But ultimately, its the songs, the catchy songs, that matter. You will be humming these for weeks, and for that I say buy it."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I was very excited to find another book by Ms. Murphy, having enjoyed her ""Stories in another language"" years ago. Sea of Trees is a story told by a young lady while she is asleep and while she is awake. Sometimes it's hard to tell which is which. This is what makes the book hard to put down. I know I've made a good choice when I read a book that makes me keep asking what will happen now, will they survive, will she be alright? Ms. Murphy has yet to show all her writing talents. Can't wait for the next book"
4,Excellence continues,Foyle was one of the best British Mysteries series ever. This one is slightly different but the high quality remains in place. very enjoyable.
5,A must read for all ages,I got this book because of a bully in my daughters pre-school class (5 years old). I think it is great and will help everybody in all aspects. It has helped me deal with people at work and neighbors. I wish everybody would read this book.
5,Galadriel rocks,"I'm a girl, and Galadriel is my fav. chick. She looks WAY better in real life than in this picture. Her cloak is cool looking when you make it look like a train on wedding gown.. experiment, you'll see what I mean. As for the pitcher, it's... kinda dumb. But you gotta get her, I got mine off ebay, try it since it's not available here. A word of caution: Be wary of the hair. Same with the other chicks. What? Let's just say Arwen's ruined because I kept picking."
4,Great Face Powder,My only complaint with this face powder is that the powder puff thing that comes with it ALWAYS starts falling apart long before the powder is running out. I've purchased this close to a dozen times and the cheap powder applicator never fails to fall apart on me... Love this powder though - it's great for a matte finish over foundation and not too heavy.
4,Good clipper,"This clipper did the job I bought it for, pruning bushes. My only quibble is that the switch for keeping the blades closed is very stiff and hard to move."
2,Better than nothing (barely),"Absolutely do not try to use this thing for heavy duty work (eg. do not use with a high torque drill), don't try to drill wide holes through thick stock, it is extremely unsafe due to the poor quality of materials (plastic and cheap pot-cast metal). It can break while in use and send parts flying or break your wrists. Beware!Other than that, it is also too wobbly and imprecise for very fine work, such as making holes for bookcase shelves or other furniture work.If you are hoping you can just use this instead of buying a drill press - don't. Save your money and buy a drill press instead, you will be much better off.It does, however, have its uses, for work that is neither heavy duty nor very precise, and can't be done on the drill press, such as the usual homeowner jobs like putting up curtains."
3,Good value,"I needed to drill some 3/4"" holes in a workbench top and this tool worked fine. It helped position my hand-held drill perpendicular to the bench top as desired. This is a fairly lightweight tool so I would not expect it to hold up to heavy/industrial usage, but it worked well for my purposes."
3,CARVER,"The first unit I received took me almost 1/2 hour before I realized that it was defective. I returned it to Amazon, and almost by return mail received another. this one went together in less than 5 minutes. The item is not a precision instrument, but it is not supposed to be. It seems to do as advertised."
3,So So,"There is some play and it is a little difficult to use. The results are fair. For the price, it is worth a try. It might work better under different circumstances."
4,DAP Collar helped our Schnauzer,"We have a Schnauzer that has separation anxiety and, in general, is a hyper dog. He has had the collar on for one month today and during this month he has only peed on the floor three times and has settled down considerably. The times that he did mess on the floor we noted that the collar had worked loose around his neck. I have just purchased a second collar and hope that this one will be the one to break him of his separation problems."
5,Adaptil Collar,The collar works a treat. It has calmed our dog when out walking and makes it much easier to regain his attention. Walking him is now a much more pleasant outing.
2,CLASSIC RETELLING,When I ordered this book I should have asked about what a CLASSIC RETELLING meant. I expected that I would receive the complete book not a children's type of edition.I should have known when the shipping charges were more that the price of the product that something was not right. Live and learn! I thought that by now ( 81 y.o.) I should have known!?Great Expectations (Classic Retelling)
2,Not a good fit,I thought this would replace the foam insert for my plug headphone. When I put them in they did not fit the headphones and they all tore so then they did not did not fit anymore. THey do have a assortment of different ones to use but the ones that comes with it did not fit.
5,A Daily Bible for Retailers,"First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day. It has found a home in my purse. My husband also loved this book. He is a network engineer and helps out my business every day. He didn't know anything about retail until we married six years ago. One Saturday I tossed the book on the bed when rushing to work and he started to read it. I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides! Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check. After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world."
2,"Mr. Kirkpatrick, please hire an editor","Once again, this book comes out with more repetitious chapters. This book can be a resource for some new material, but it is not to be read straight through. Self-publishing has its downside, and this book demonstrates that. Kirkpatrick is a nice old newspaperman, and he has written several scores of short articles and collected them into his idea of a book. It must pay very well, emotionally if not monetarily, becuse he keeps doing it, but it does not serve anyone who values their time."
4,B-Movie Musical of the 1930s,"Not to be confused with ""Top Hat"", this is a b-movie musical from the 1930s made by a minor studio. It's a pleasant movie with some catchy music and some decent comedy. It's not a great movie by any means, but it's fairly enjoyable. Picture quality is fairly lacking, though."
3,User unfriendly but that material is still quite good,"This is yet another of the very good early years Monty Python albums that has been put onto CD and no track listing added nor have the tracks been separated, you get two tracks, the equivalent of side one and side two of the original LP release from the 70's.That gripe aside there is some pretty darn excellent skits on here such as Travel Agent which has gone down as not only one of the great Python sketches but really should be in every comedy fans collection somewhere. Elsewhere while I found plenty of guffaws on this as a teenager it's the early album I reach for least out of them all. After all with a couple of albums already under their belts at this point much of their best material had already been released onto audio by this point.Still, Python fans are nothing if not committed and really given the price most of these albums are available for there is no reason not to get the whole lot."
4,"Yes, this CD!","While not as good as, say, ""Another Monty Python CD,"" this one definitely amuses. ""Argument Clinic,"" ""1972 Eclipse of the Sun,"" ""Dennis Moore,"" and the various radio quiz-game segments are hilarious. ""The Brontasaurus Sketch"" will either annoy or delight you, and doesn't hold up well under repeated listenings, nor does the fairy tale bit at the end. However, if you're a Python fan, you'll want this CD, and if you're not, you should get it anyway, because the good parts definitely outway the bad parts."
4,Intellectual gross jokes.,"Duchovny skewers his own image, Orland Jones rolls his eyes and howls...a giant space alien gets a shampoo enema.What's not to love?Not the best comedy but better than most."
2,OK if it's your first time,"Plainly re-hashing too many movies, you can almost see the whole crew getting sick of it towards the end, as we all were. I don't think there's any point in it, except to make a bit of money, which no-one can actually object to; but nobody laughed much at the cinema where I saw it, except maybe at David Duchovny's arse."
4,Evolution,Possibly too hip for the room. Duchovny shows comedic spark as does Julianne Moore. Lots of inside jokes. Good fun. I'll never think of a fruit basket in the same way again.
1,I must be missing something ...,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, hands down. It's odd, though -- I like all the actors involved, I like the director, and I like the subject matter, yet I still fell asleep less than an hour into it. I missed about 10 minutes but, alas, really missed nothing.I will give the film credit, though, for being a perfect cross between an 80s college/party flick (example: the equally terrible ""Revenge of the Nerds II,"" III, etc.) and an imaginary X-Files episode where David Duchovny is drunk, high, or both. He is so terrible it's almost as if Agent Mulder has taken the weekend off, and has gone to play ""goofy scientist"" in a movie filmed on Fantasy Island. Julianne Moore is slumming big-time.There are elements of many Ivan Reitman vehicles here, too, including ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Stripes,"" but without the laughs. The non-funniness is sometimes so painful you keep expecting the actors to crack up and say ""Can we do that over again??"""
4,A Good Time with Sci-Fi comedy,This is an fun way to enjoy alien invasion and the possible destruction of humanity. You can tell that everyone had fun being involved with this film. This is what the fun side of the X-Files looks like. The truth is out there.
4,Oldy But Goody,Last time I watched this I was 12. It is still as funny and as awsome as before. Worth a buy.
2,AlienBusters - Not!,Parts of this film were like forcing a square block through a round hole... what was up with the writing!? Great actors with nothing but a few base jokes and visual effects. If you liked Ghostbusters rent that or buy the DVD and leave this one for HBO.
3,Average.,"Watchable, if only for the novelty of seeing Fox Mulder not being Fox Mulder.I vaguely enjoyed the concept but found myself in the second half just waiting for it to end."
5,great movie with exellent special effects!,"this is a very funny movie with exellent creature designsby phil tippet and a good plot with good performances. If all movies had special effects like this, I'd be in heaven!"
1,You can skip this one,"Boy, this one is just not funny. I'm not sure I ever even cracked a smile. Ridiculous."
4,"Hey, it's good entertainment","I actually enjoyed this movie very much. I know all the science may be off-putting, but I did get a kick out of all the action, humor, and CGI. All of the actors (Duchovny, Moore, Jones, William Scott, and Ackyroyd) give out great performances. The alien designs look very unrealistic, but very unique. The visual humor not that excessive, but numerous enough to keep the laughs coming.Overall, this is a silly Sci-Fi film that's VERY fun to watch. B+"
3,"Not a brilliant comedy, but great visual effects","If you're over 13, and not a shill working for the movie studio, you're not going to think this movie is funny. However, if you're into 3D animation, or admire the visual effects work of Tippett Studio, then you should definately get the DVD, and you'll want to study some sequences frame by frame. Once it gets going (after the first 20 minutes or so), this movie really is a great showcase of computer-animated creatures and effects, which would have received more acclaim from the industry if they hadn't appeared in a bad comedy. It seemed when it came out that nobody wanted to talk about the great sequences in this film, just because they didn't want to act as though they were into laim comedies with lots of fart jokes and david duchovny mooning the camera, but if you just watch the whole thing in director-commentary mode from the beginning, you'll be really glad to have this disc."
3,Fun flick,"Back in 1999 I read the spec script when Evolution was originally written as a serious horror science fiction film, two years later the film was released and was totally changed.Evolution is meant to be nothing but a fun flick and that what is. The film is in the vein of Ghostbusters and has very funny moments. Seann William Scott makes this movie for me though and it's a shame he still hasn't got that break through role. The action sequences and direction also make this a good film. Check it out for a good time."
3,Common Sense Recommendations,"This book is a general guide to the graduate admission process. It does not give you any edge besides telling you what is the procedure to apply to graduate school. It gives you many common sense recommendations aimed at preventing you from choosing your school, or applying to your schools at the last minute... Common sense advices on the graduate admissions procedure. You could independently derive many of the recommendations featured in this guide by thinking methodically and reading the admissions page of Average University.

2,What happened to Joshua Kadison?,"I loved ""Painted Desert Serenade."" I thought it was a great album. All the songs were great.Then I listened to ""Delilah Blue."" Some of the songs were way too long. ""Take it on Faith"" and John Steinbeck's ""The Pearl"" were the only songs worth listening to. The background gospel singers sound like nails across a chalkboard.My question is: What happened to J.K. after his first album? Also, his new album is an import album, but sounds great, much like ""Desert."" That album should be available in the USA at a regular price, not an import price.Josh, keep up the good music, but forget the gospel singers, please!Also, I enjoyed his book a lot ""17 Ways to eat a mango."" Check it out!"
2,Very Poor Quality and Customer Service...,"I bought this unit from Park & Sun last Christmas (2005) for my kids. Installation was easy enough and we were having fun with it for the first few weeks. At that point the electronic scoring stopped working, and I called Park & Sun for a replacement unit. They were out of stock but promised to get me a new unit. It never arrived after months of additional calls, so I finally gave up. In the meantime, the rest of the unit fell apart with normal use. The unit is all plastic parts, velcro, and nylong cord/netting, so over time the side netting broke loose, the connection of the net to the backboard tore away, and all that still worked was the metal rim. I finally took it down and threw it away.It may be that my experience with the product and company was isolated, but I wanted to post this review so that others were at least aware of the potential issues."
1,money wasted,"bought this piece of junk last year; it didn't even last 1 day of use at a kids party! The rim/hoop wouldn't stay up, so 1 of the kids had to stand on a chair to hold it up for the other kids to have some small measure of fun!!money wasted. i'm an international purchaser so it wouldn't even be worth the while (in terms of shipping)to return this item. Totally disappointed!"
2,Great Concept-Poor Quality,"Great idea for our basement with low ceilings (7 ft. ) Installation was easy enough (although 2 of the 6 screws provided broke (but we were able to use some of our own screws to replace). After less than 24 hours of use the PVC frame cracked and now it makes it difficult to play and fold up to put away. I called the manufacturer to ask for a replacement frame. The parts were not in, but I was promised to receive them in a few weeks. I hope that the replacement parts hold up longer than the original??!! My kids absolutely love the game 5 yr. old and 2 yr. old. I actually replaced the original balls with softer ones (for safety indoors). We will see if the manufacturer comes though with the parts and if they can hold up better this time. I hope they do."
4,Park n Sun fold up basketball game,"Great space saver. Pretty sturdy. Comes with 3 balls to blow up, Looks very nice on the wall. Drawers fold shut to appear as a cabinet. Would recommend for younger kids. May not be sturdy enough for teenagers, Great for my 11 year old and his friends,"
1,TERRIBLE SERVICE,It is now a month past the day I ordered it and still have not received the book. Ordered another book from another company and received their book within 7 days. Very frustrating - WON'T EVER ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN.
4,Lovely,These books were exactly what I needed. I thank you for the price and quality that I received.
1,Wrong Product,Seller would not accept return or even respond when informed about it being the wrong product.
4,THE BEST,"This is the best protein powder that I have tried and I love it. Using it in a fruit shake for either breakfast or lunch works well. especially when you are always busy and on the go, none better. Try it you will not be disappointed."
5,Corona pruner,This is my favorite pruner and I use it for everything. This is the third one of this sort that I've had. I was happy to find it online since my local garden center didn't carry it.
5,Interior Plantscaping,"I use these shears to maintain indoor plants. They can trim leaf edges and tips, as sharp as scissors, and cut stems up to 5/8"" very easily. I even use them on thin dead wood. I carry these in a Corona nylon scabbard which is very handy. I have Corona bypass pruner for the big stuff, but seldom have to take them out. I have not sharpened these yet; I believe they will be as good as new when I do. If they get sticky they clean right up with oil and greenie. Years ago, I had the smaller version but these do it all."
3,Overall very cool but...,The overall making of this toy was very durable but the sword broke immediately. It was much too flimsy for something that is supposed to be used for slashing and stabbing. We really liked this guy but were forced to return it due to the defective sword.
3,"Worth my money, for sure...","I scored this little treasure for $1 in the bargain bin, new. Nothing really ground breaking, just good, straight forward death metal with a few variations. It may grow on me the more I listen to it, but I haven't given it a chance yet. For the price here on Amazon, it's probably worth it for you, but check out some sound bites first to make sure."
5,Helped a Friend,"One of my dearest frinds has had a terrible time through the years and did not realize the issue in his health was gluten. I read this book and gave it to him and after three monts he told me""I love this book.It has been an enormous aid in controling my symptoms. The recipes are fairly simple and though I know the triggers it was helpful to see them spelled out.""S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest"
1,Unusable and web fluid is flammable,"My 6 year old son had to have this toy because of the tv commercials and he's spiderman's number one fan.Opening the battery compartment was difficult. I had to try 4 different phillips head screwdrivers and then resorted to prying the compartment open.When I put the fluid cannister in, at first it would not discharge. When I moved it around some, I got it to discharge but rather than spray a ""spinning web"" it released a growing blob of sticky, toxic smelling goo which stuck to the front of the ""blaster"". I had to tell my son that one of his key christmas gifts did not work. I felt really bad for a family that could only afford one gift for their child and this was it.Because the goo smelled toxic and because it came from China, I took some outside and tried to light it with a match (the box says it is not flammable and not toxic). The goo immediately went up in flames. I suggest that Habro recall this sorry P.O.S. before someone burns their house down with it."
3,No joy in the grip,"Blessed are they whose tools fit comfortably in the hand, not only at first, but as they continue to use them.This, for me, is NOT that tool.Maybe because I have small hands for a man? Whatever: the curved shape, the swollen hard rubber, the plentiful hard rubber nubbins on the handle's underside -- like a diseased pig's swollen teats -- all conspire to remind me of the downside of mail order.Hey, I am glad that the other people are happy with it. The thing IS strong enough. But no pleasure in it."
1,Really disappointing,"I was looking for the New York Times large atlas and it continues to be out of print. But I love the DK eyewitness guides to Paris and London so I thought I'd find the same high standards here, but not so. Even if you look up something so mainstream as New York State you only get a 9 state regional map with so little detail as to be virtually useless. It was as expensive as a big atlas and I expected more for the money."
5,Terrific Atlas for grade school,"I bought this atlas for my third grade son. Unlike atlases for adults, which are mostly pages of maps with a summary for each section, there is something to read about each region on every page. The maps have callouts to little tidbits on each area. He can learn something about any area he opens the page to. Highly recommended for independent readers from third or fourth grade on."
4,Philosophical gem,"This is an ultimate classic for those that love Kafka, mathematical games and philosophy. In a series of fantastic stories Lem shows to be a master in crafting compelling stories, all vivid and laden with simple yet deep wisdom. All stories do leave philosophical traces that may positively linger on in your head for days.The translation is outstanding. Originally written in Polish, yet the translation of Michael Kandel is perfect. If you wouldn't know better, you'd think the book was natively written in English."
5,My favorite book ...,Get this book and give a copy to all of your friends. Period. It's that good. At times it leaves you breathlessly enlightened. Lem should be granted immortality (supposing that's a good thing.) Michael Kandel's translation is magical. Email me if you want to discuss the book.
5,Marvellous,An excellent travel in space and mind by the most brilliant science fiction author of our days!
2,Be careful what you expect,"I agree with Shadowfire below about many things. Those who come to this from Solaris, expect something different. These are cybernetic pseudo-scientific fairy tales... amazing translation job, but I can't help thinking that the stories are a bit too dull."
4,I wish I could read Polish,"I loved this book, although I'm unwilling to give a full 5 star rating because I didn't really like the characters, although they were often funny and Lem used them perfectly in the stories.I am amazed that the book is actually translated from Polish. The language is so clever and well used that I'm sure that the translator probably deservers almost as much credit as Lem does.My favorite is the Electronic Bard who is asked to write a poem: ""This is a poem about a haircut! But lofty, nobel, tragic, timeless, full of love, treachery, retribution, quiet heroism in the face of certain doom! Six lines, cleverly rhymed, and every word beginning with the letter ""s""!""and the bard came out with:Seduced, shaggy Samson snored.She scissored short. Sorely shorn,etc...read the rest, it's well worth your time."
5,Fractured Fables,"The Cyberiad is the type of book worth reading over and over again, since there's just so much to get out of it. On one level, there's the simple humor of the stories, with the antics of Trurl and the pragmatism of Klapacius; on another level there's a deep moral message that runs throughout all the stories. As always, the Michael Kandel translation is beautiful; I had to wonder just how he reproduced some of the poems and clever wordings in such perfect clarity. Definitely worth buying."
2,Drycleaning,This book is good if you want to write a business plan for your business. It doesn't talk much about actually running a plant and it does not mention anything about aberage profit and expenses involved in this type of business.
2,Good for hero storage,"My son rarely plays with this thing. He mainly uses it for a convenient place to store his heroes and vehicles. Assembly was easy and the thing is tougher than boot leather. My son (3 yrs old - 30lbs) uses it as a step stool. The review by ""a toy enthusiast"" pretty much echoes my feelings on this item."
1,Was not a big hit for our 5 year old who is a big RH fan!,"My five year old got this for Christmas a year ago. Him and his friends play with the rescue heroes for hours and loved the space station. However, this thing is NEVER played with. They are still playing with the space station and I would recomend getting that if it's still sold. Problem is a family member got aqua center for him so I don't want to get rid of it yet. It's very big and takes up a lot of room. However, I gave it 5 stars for durability since it's only use is when my 2 year old uses it as a step stool to get to the toys on the shelf!"
4,A composer of note (4+ stars).,"This is a terrific film score that works tremendously well with the visuals on screen. If Steven Spielberg reads this, I hope he will strongly consider the versatile and musically-sensitive Ms. Tyson-Chew for ""Jurassic Park 4."" NTC has the tools and the talent...all she needs now is that major film to move her career into high gear. I have no doubt it will soon happen. For another side of Nerida Tyson-Chew, check out the DVD of the Australian film ""Under The Light House Dancing."""
3,Brief excitement,"For a soundtrack CD with 20 tracks and over an hour of music, Nerida Tyson-Chew's score for Anacondas often fails to come to life. The only tracks of note are the more gentler cues, which are really quite nice. But I bought this CD expecting non-stop action music. That ain't what I got.Only the last 2 tracks contain any excitement, the rest are just boring with no melody or theme. Quite a disappointment I must say, but still better than Randy Edelman's score for the first film. In fact the Anacondas score more resembles Graeme Revell's score for Freddy vs Jason in regards to the dark but generic horror sound and sparse moments of action.There are about 5 good tracks on this CD (2,5,6,19,20) but the rest is an unlistenable waste of time. A missed opportunity but a loud thrilling score no doubt."
4,Great For Printing Game Materials,I'm an avid board gamer and often want to print supplements for my boardgames. I bought this paper to use for this purpose. This paper worked great to print out cards (I sleeved them to protect them as they may have been a little thinner than I would have liked) as well as play-mats. I have an Epson Stylus Rx595 and the images come out looking great on this paper. The one thing this paper didn't do well was work for tuck boxes. As soon as I opened the paper I could tell it wasn't going to be ideal for tuck boxes as it wasn't nearly thick enough. With that said the tuck boxes served their purpose and the paper folded easily making construction a breeze. The only downside is I don't expect them to last very long.All in all for lighter projects you cant beat this paper. It looks great and is fairly thick without getting into the card stock territory. However if you need a thick heavy card stock I suggest looking elsewhere!
2,Great book; horrible formatting,"A superb noir novel, tight and surprise filled, is damaged by shoddy proofreading with tons of typographical errors.This was the first of 100+ Kindle purchases I've made that actually froze frequently on my Kindle reader despite a second download."
4,The primacy of Peter from a Protestant.,"I had the pleasure of accompanying the author on a street evangelism field trip to Lexington, KY in 1973. He graciously gave me a copy of his book.Mr. Coleman manages to identify how methodical and intentional Jesus was in putting together his band of Apostles and sending them out to be His witnesses. He even makes a strong case for the primacy of Peter without using that kind of language. But the author stops short when going down this road because it unavoidably leads to Rome and the ancient church Christ founded on Peter, the twelve and the prophets with Jesus Himself as the chief capstone. In that his otherwise helpful book paints a truncated view of ""church""."
3,worked OK for awhile on smaller branches,"1.5"" capacity is a stretch. Sometimes branches are caught between the blades requiring tightening of the nut. On mine, after 3 years, the bracket for the bumper broke. It was made of cheaper diecast metal and broke right by the attachment rivets. Looking for a replacement now and will attempt the warranty route. I liked the loppers at first but I think I will move up to the corona professional grade instead."
1,A film with no redemption,"This movie was described by the Chicago Tribune as ""Hilarious and Rowdy! Lurid and Sexy"" The New York Times called it ""An Amusing Comedy"". Wouldn't you think that means it should be funny? Instead, it is a horrid tragedy with not a single character having any redeeming value. They are all full of greed, lust and lies. The language was horrible, and quite frankly, I've never found arson and incest to be that humorous."
1,Green Hornet Set,This set contains pirated material recorded off of television. Quality is average. The TV network logos pop up every once in a while.
3,Good set - this is definitely a bootleg,"Overall the set is okay for the fans of the Green Hornet. However there is one episode missing from the 1966-1967 series, Episode 15 ""May the Best Man Lose"". Also note that these episodes were copied off of the STARZ Action Channel as noticed in the closing credits of each episode the stations logo is visible."
4,Young kids love Coach Coz,Coach Coz knows how to get the little one's up and dancing. My kids talk about him ALOT! He is more popular in house then any other character on video right now. I only wish there were more music videos included--the best part of the DVD! After seeing Coach Coz wash a car--my kids ran outside and washed mine!!Good clean fun for everyone!
4,Science Teacher,This book has two really fun activities to do with children in grades 4-6. The children will be involved in solving a crime. The supplies you will need to do these activities can usually be found in your own home.
2,cute toy but a piece of crap,"Our son is crazy about the Cars movie, so we picked up a few of the pullback vehicles for Christmas as stocking stuffers/advent calendar presents. The Mater and Lightning toys' pullback features broke within minutes of gentle play. Would have expected better from Disney/Pixar merchandise. If you want to avoid tears on Christmas avoid these disappointing pieces of junk."
3,Not a Six Sigma Strategy Text!,"I expected the book to address the organizational and strategic issues related to implementing Six Sigma in a healthcare organization. Instead, the book has some nice case studies on applying statistical analysis to process problems and a general discussion of quality systems. This isn't the book for someone looking to implement a process improvement program but may be a useful reference for non-statisticians looking to strengthen their statistical toolkit."
4,So Cute!,"I'm pretty excited about using this cookie cutter, I only wished it was a bit bigger. I work in a pet store and plan on making these for my co-workers, I think they will love them."
5,Practical Bruner,"What I enjoyed most about Bruner's practical and insightful collection of essays collected in this book is his wisdom. Bruner's contribution to education, after years researching and engineering much of the Cognitive Revolution in psychology, has to be acknowledged.Specifically, I enjoyed his emphasis on ""intersubjectivity,"" a term used to described the process of learning using cultural, social stimuli in collusion with internal cognitive processes. Bruner repeatedly stresses the balance needed to sustain the view that individuals learn within their environment as well as through their biological background.Keep this book in your library; it will be one that you underline and refer to frequently."
5,Good Road Bicycle Tube,"Pros:1) 48 mm stem length allows ease to hold stem with fingerswhile mounting and dismounting a pump so as to avoid breakingthe tubes presta head.2) Sturdy tube wears well on road bicycles.3) Smooth stem (rather than threaded) remains clean.Cons:1) Should be more widely available, it's a good tube."
2,"money , money, money","rough mixes, demo recording, studio chats.....die hard fans will be happy with this release. Unfortunately I'm not a huge fan !the last album let it be, abbey road, white album were okay,.....but the next re-release would be done because of the money maker.If u love this cd then buy it! and send your money to the record company, and especially ringo starr and Paul mc cartney are surely happy if they get the money from the buyers!"
5,PICKS UP WHERE VOLUME 2 LEFT OFF,"AS GREAT AS VOLUME 2 WAS,THIS IS JUST AS GOOD! A SMASHING VERSION OF OB-LA-DI,OB-LA-DA, A PROTOTYPE OF HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN, A EARLY VERSION OF LET IT BE,ABBEY ROAD OUTTAKES,AND A INCREDIBLE ACOUSTIC VERSION OF WHILE MY GUITAR MAKES THIS 5 STAR ALL THE WAY.EVEN A LOT OF THERE WORKING TITLES WHERE FANTASTIC!"
2,They Shoulda Stopped With Anthology Two,"This is painful to listen to (and not in a good way like say, ""Cold Turkey""). Two stars only because it's the ""Fab Four""."
1,Garbage,What can you say about a band that is supposedly brilliant and legendary that writes a song 'Happiness Is a Warm Gun'.Take away the hype and aura of the Beatles and what are you left with? No talent.
4,Now for the Get Back album,"This album is complementary to the others in the series, it doesn't stand alone. However some of the selections are puzzling, particularly the versions of Two of Us and Teddy Boy. Both are outtakes which never made it onto the aborted Get Back albums. Teddy Boy in particular is disappointing. In its original form it went for over five minutes and appeared on the first Get Back album. In edited form it appeared on the second version of Get Back. On this particular album we get a different version which breaks down halfway through. Surely the original unedited Get Back version could have been included? The same goes for Two of Us - a limp outtake which pales into insignificance when compared with the Get Back version. The only solution is to release the original Get Back album to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Let It Be's release. Beatles fans have been demanding this for many years and EMI and Apple shouldn't hold back any longer."
3,Corona Ratchet Clipper RP3230...Good news...Bad news,"When the Corona clipper arrived...we put it right to work. We have arthritis and the ratchet feature made it a breeze to cut branches from many bushes on our 5 acres. After about a month; the clipper broke. One of the rivets broke just when we were taking it to our neighbors to show them how great it was.*Smile* The neighbor fixed it; and we have been using it. We were disappointed that it broke so quickly...although, we were able to do alot of pruning...without hurting our hands trying to manually push the prunner to cut through tough branches of bushes. I would only recommend using a ratchet pruner...however, this one did not hold up."
4,Works as advertised,I really liked using these when I tried them out. I bought them for my grandmother. She loves them. She has no trouble cutting through things that she wasnt able to before having the ratchet action. They work exactly as advertised and designed. I'd reccommend these to anyone.
3,The last riders,"What can I say? It's just one of those 'bikerflicks' with a lot of shooting and violence. It's still amusing though, but not very believable, especcialy the fact that the main character stays alive when his whole trailer is filled with lead! But there are much worse movies."
1,this is a huge waste of money,I sit in an office that will reach over 75 in the summer so I thought this would be perfect. It would be perfect except it is so cheaply constructed that the fan continuously malfunctions. Do not buy this! The fan will stop spinning within a month. You are better off with a regular fan.
2,not exactly what I expected,"Perhaps my expectations were to high, the product is good as long as you have an endless supply of ""C"" batteries, or an endless supply of pre-frozen water bottles to insert. A little bit too much work."
4,Desktop Air Conditioner,"It is a small, narrow fan unless you use iced water. Then it will feel more like an a/c. It will not help in direct sunlight. It will only cool your upper body, not a cubicle or ""closet""."
3,Author against the world,"I loved his book, First You Must Row. In it I saw a humble man, a gentle man, an introspective man. As a child he found himself alone, but through the kindness of others and his own open heart, he forged an honorable path. His insight into that was a gift.In THIS book he comes across as a closed minded angry old man. Instead of stories that give insight into how to integrate with a sometimes cold world, the stories center on the failings of others.. as compared to his high and noble path. Abour one third of the way in I just gave up.As a child it seems Richard found the road to a happy, contented, and meaningful life through the gentle hand of caring relatives and strangers. If he has chosen to repay the gift by taking his turn giving to others, it doesn't come through in the first third of this book."
4,Delightful,"Richard Bode yet again gives the reader a unique outlook on life and its events with this book. I really enjoyed ""First You Have to Row a Little Boat,"" and this book comes very close to capturing that same magic. If you don't have either, get both - I've read both books several times over, and I will continue to do so. I get something new and refreshing from them with each reading."
1,A concept album that falls flat,"Plat du Jour is proof that even brilliant, talented, creative people like Matthew Herbert can have an off day. What was he thinking? Herbert gets so wrapped up in the message that he is trying to convey that the music, and I use that term loosely to describe this disc, is prententious, self-absorbed and self-righteous. Having 100 people bite into 100 different types of apples is just stupid, unless you're doing it live as a performance piece. Playing water bottles filled with different brands of water is pointless.This is a concept album that would have worked better as a live performance piece or a video. It's only worth listening to for the awesome track Celebrity, the only real song on here.I will stick to Around the House or Bodily Functions."
4,don't miss this,"With all the twists and turns of the plot in I Know What You Did Last Summer the book was almost impossible to put down. Though the book starts out a little slow , all the remarkably developed characters make up for it. Also, there is a surprise ending that will leave anyone shocked. Even if you have seen the movie you will still love the book because it is drastically different of the movie. In conclusion, anyone will adore this combination of friendship, romance, and horror."
4,I Know What You Did Last Summer,"I Know What You Did Last Summer was an excellent and exciting book. The author, Lois Duncan, was very descriptive. Every once in awhile, she carried a scene on to long. However, that did not stop me from reading this book. I also enjoyed the characters' profiles. They were interesting because regardless of their different lifestyles and personalities, everyone fit well into the story plot. I would suggest this book to anyone, especially if you enjoy mystery and adventure."
2,Disappointing,"....i rated this book average because it is like ANY other scary book you would read about. This book is about these kids who are being stalked by an unknown killer seeking revenge (a unique story line isn't it?...sarcasm). This is an average book. If this was the only horror book ever to be released in the world, it would have been rated a 10. However, it wasnt. So based on every other horror book iv'e read/ watched, this book is a 3."
3,I knowwhat you did last summer,julie got up wonmarring and it wasover the summer and she had 1 letter by her bowl on he tabe it was a small white letter and in dark black letters it said her name juile. she opened it up and on the endside in said I Now what You Did last summer.See the summer befour that her and 3 othe friend of hers had been driving home and it was dark they didnt see the man walking in the middle of the road and they hit hem. They didnt know what to do so they tried to cover it up and they all said that they wouldnt tel anyone ever no matter what. Well the secret was out some how because someone know and was wanting reving. They looked for clues and tried to come up with an idea on who could know. All they found was that it was getting wors and in the end the only ones left alive was Julie and Berry you will have to read the store and find out what happens next but it is a really good book and you should read it.
1,The boring book,I did not like this book because it was boring.I do not recomend it.It was not scary and less killing.I think the movie is better.
4,"Despite the New Cover, Not the Movie","Lois Duncan is a skilled writer of children's suspense tales and I Know What You Did Last Summer is one of her best or certainly, because of the successful movie and sequal, one of her most famous. I originally read it in the seventies and was thrilled with it and became a fan of Lois Duncan and have since read it in the wake of seeing the movie and the book still holds up in the category of suspense. The lead character is well developed and very strongly written while the supporting characters add nice window dressing to the whole endeavor. People expecting the horror, gore, and death toll of the movie will be dissappointed. This is teen suspense of the old school variety."
3,Totally Different,"Ok, this movie had a whole different plot than the book. In the book they kept driving and they were at a party and they were a little high and they hit a small boy on a bike. The ending was a little predictable, but overall a fair book."
2,Not what I expected,I was really excited about reading this book. After reading many other of Lois Duncan's books and seeing the movie I was sure this book would be an instant favorite....I was wrong! I found this book boring and unexciting! I couldnt pay attention to anything that was happening. I really thought she could have done better.
3,4 teens night of the 4th of july hit a child and hit and run,"This about 4 teens drinking having fun and driving. They hit a child and are afraid to confess. A year later one gets a not saying "" I know what you did last summer"". So now some one knows and is stalking them in a dedly game they can run but they cant hide. I thought it was alright but the movie was better."
5,The book was very different from the movie!!!!!!!!,I finished the book about a month before I heard about the movie. I really loved the book and couldn't wait to see the movie. I was kinda dissappointed to find out that the movie was completely different from the book. I loved them both though.
5,Summer Revenge,"This book had such a suspenseful twist that the last five chapters kept you holding on for breath. Although the books didn't resemble the movie at all, I enjoyed the book much better for no one died, and the killer is involved in the story. There is a killer though, and someone wants revenge for the horrible crime that they committed.In the book, instead of hitting a fisherman on the road, they ran over a little boy on his bicycle, and they didn't go back to make their apologies, instead they bury past and never mention it to anyone, and this mistake may cause them the biggest price of a lifetime."
4,Not A Bad Book!!,"This book is a very good book. But if you are going to read it JUST because of the movie, you might be disapointed because some things are different. The plot is almost the same: four drunk teenagers accidently kill a boy on his bycicle. They decide to make a pact: No one will ever know what they did. So they don't see each other anymore until someone sends to one of the teens, a note saying: I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. They become desparate and start investigating who is blackmailing them. The story has a great suspense climax and the end is very good. Still, in this book there are no deaths and I think that would of made me give this book five stars."
2,Not Nearly As Good As The Movie!!,I read the book about a year ago and felt that it was not very suspenseful or entertaing. With the movie I could relate to the characters but not with them in the book. I thought it was a little lame that the stalker tried to kill the teens but was unsecessful. I also didn't like how he/she toyed with them. Were as the movie they toyed with the teens very well and scared the... out of them.
1,Predictable and boring,"I knew instantly exactly who the stalker was and had to drag myself through this book. The ending was awful and the characters annoying. Please, ignore the book and go rent the movie instead."
3,Not quite like the movie...,"I am a great fan of horrors, terrors, slashers .etc. I have seen I know what you did last Summer, which was not as good as SCREAM, but very good, and a very smart story. But I have to say that the book is on the same direction as the movie, but almost all the parts are different(Ex: Instead of hitting a fisherman, they hit someone on a bicycle) This confused me and many friends, but it was still smartly layed- out, and entertaining. You should read it!"
4,My Book Review,I liked the book because has action and the move is same because Ihas idea of he.I has the book in may house and is very good.the move has much pictures and action. I recommend read.
4,I Know What You Did Last Summer,"Last summer four terrified friends named Barry, Helen, Julie, and Ray make a desperate pact to conceal a shocking secret.Unfortunately now someone has found out about their secret and is out to kill them. They thought he was dead until they find out that death is back again. I think that this is the perfect book for somebody under thirteen or older to read."
1,decieving,"Compared to the other books by this author, which I have also read it was the worst one yet. I am extremely surprised that a movie producer was so desperate as to have it acted out. Had I been able to, I would not have given it any stars whatsoever!"
2,"Different, fast paced, unique... but not good.","Not good. I bought this book to read it cause it was a top choice of many reviewers, but I didn't like it. Neither the style (short phrases, too much dialog, kind of fast-paced, very short chapters) nor the characters (single-sided and totally unlikable). The story once again features an Aztec demon guest star straight from Mictlan. One or two nice ideas but other than that not good at all..."
3,I agree with Kurt,that this is his worst books and i have read nine of them. This book is not as good as The Sirens of Titans or Mother Night but a weaker effort is still better then most authors best works. Vonnegut was one of the few author who's prologues are worth reading i usually skip over them if the first page does not catch my interest. This has one of his best because it is more personal it is sad but not too sad just like the majority of his novels. So in short if you are a fan already then it would not hurt for you to read this book but if you are just starting out i suggest Cat's Cradle or his most famous but not best book Slaughter House Five.
4,Vonnegut's downhome Dadaist look at 1 of many USA futures.,Vonnegut's downhome Dadaist look at 1 of many USA futures is engrossing entertaining and like a Model-A cruising in Outerspace.
3,Superficial and repetitive,"As the other reviewers have already pointed out, there were a number of typos in this book, ""chidren"" being the worst I found. Shays's Rebellion is referred to as both Shays Rebellion and Shays' Rebellion.I thought this book might more appropriately have been marketed to the young adult market. Its lack of specific detail and its repetition diminished its interest for me. We are told that Abigail managed the farm while John was away, but what exactly did she do in managing the farm? We are told that she taught her children at home for a time, but what did she teach them? Perhaps such details are not available, but that doesn't excuse the repetition. How many times do we need to be told that Abigail missed John when he was away from home? Once or twice would do it for me.I'm afraid I admired Abigail Adams more before I read this book than I do now. This is not a biography that makes you feel as if you're living with the subject, and the writing is pedestrian."
2,covenant of the forge,i didnt really care for the story line it didnt take me long to put it down and forget it
3,This tweezer worked just like all other tweezers. ...,"This tweezer worked just like all other tweezers. I didn't really see a big difference. I hate tweezing my eyebrows and this didn't make it any easier. Maybe I'm bad at tweezing, but this didn't make the process any less painful. I think this tweezer is sharper at the ends -- that might make it easier for those who are good at plucking eyebrows. Overall, it's an average product -- maybe a little above average."
2,Hard to figure out and DOES NOT include HRM,"I ordered this based on the review that proceeded me. I had done a search for a heart rate chronograph and this was one of many choices. I had ordered it for the HRM and the chronography. There was no HRM as believed and the ability to program the watch was very difficult to a ""beginner"" like me. The buttons were very small and it almost took a hammer to get them to move. Although the band was water-resistant, to me it felt flimsy and like it could break at any time. Perhaps others have better figured this watch out, though for me, it was not. I have decided to look for something more practical and not so ""up-to-date""."
2,A lot shorter than 400 minutes,"The Amazon info clearly indicates a running time of 400 minutes. If that were so don't you think more than one dvd would have been required? And wouldn't that have been plenty of time to show all the music videos, not just 16? It is a huge, immensely glaring mis-representation. IMDB more accurately states the running time as 30 minutes. That's only 370 minutes less, while Netflix claims a running time of 333 minutes. Did someone just stutter? Otherwise, the videos are great and Spike Jonze deserves a lot of recognition."
1,unreliable,I purchased this device mainly for the digital compass which turned out to be completely unreliable.
3,More suited for specialst.,This book seems too difficult for an elementary teacher candidate. Seems more appropriate for a reading specialist. I am struggling with it.
4,teaching reading in today's elemetary schools,this is agreat book and should be a part of every elementary school teachers' library.
3,Small Frie!!,"I received the DVD as promised. The comedian Small Frie is hilarious. I would buy any DVD she is a part of. However, the other comedians gave a good effort, but their material was dry!"
3,"The seasons in Provence, as seen by a retiring couple.",This is a delighful movie that is very entertaining in a very intelectually enriching manner. The movie shows the beautiful country side of Provence while telling wonderful stories of the experiances of a couple trying to retire from England. The two face troubles with the leisurly pace of the country side and their coping with the change provides a very relaxing and enriching movie session.
4,scenery brings back memories,A group of friends rented a home in Provence last year and this video brought back so many memories of our visit. The movie was clever and it helped me practice my limited French.
2,Hmmm...???,"Poor and inaccurate history gets in the way of the material this author tries to present. In addition, the culturally related material is seriously flawed when we compare this with what we know from anthropological and historical sources. I think what we have in this book is another ""Witchcraft the way I wish it was/is"" type of work.As to the rites and spells contained in this book, they appear to be the general mediocre variety common to most books published today, and are relatively harmless enough for the masses to enjoy. However, I believe the author's apparent misunderstanding of such things as the Rede, the Charge, the Witches' Rune, and the ""Fivefold and Sevenfold Blessing"" may cause further confusion by adding to the misinformation that has become the standard for books on the Craft today."
4,Good Wiccan Essential,"This was the second guide to the craft I purchased and I think that it is a great resource for those in solitary practice. The most interesting thing (and perhaps unexpected)that I found in the book was the history located in the back of the book. Good detailed descriptions as well as loose suggestions on how to celebrate the 8 holidays on the witches calender were appreciated. I particularly ejoy Aoumiel's personal background and her insistence on freedom of options when it comes to choosing your rituals and reiterating the standard idea that you don't have to do anything rigid to feel confident in your practice. I also love her comparisons of traditional Wiccan holidays to those borrowed dates of Christian holidays, you know, just for a giggle and not written in a way to be superior. Most do not realize that each different religion in the world celebrates the same holidays, we just have different names for them! Good book if you are building your library on witchcraft..."
1,Not historically accurate... at all,"She makes several referances to norse paganism and is completely wrong on it. I think she's just another author with her head in the clouds writing things that sell to ignorant people. If you like fiction, by all means, read it. If you want something with some spiritual substance and historical accuracy, look somewhere else.. needless to say, I gave this book to a Wiccan friend of mine."
2,Eh,"It;s alright but ot really worth buying at full price, buy it used. The information presented is alright at best but the author really dosent touch on all the subjects proclaimed in the title, One the cover part of the subtitle reads Fairy Lore, theres hardly any of this present. If you are seeking an excelent book on the green craft then I reccomend HEALING WISE BY SUSUN WEED"
3,Ok.....,Its kinda cakey under my foundation and doesn't blend well... its water proof to a point. i am not a fan. i gave it to my mom. she likes it.
2,Disappointment,"I watched Arabian Nights on television and I loved it. I loved everything about it: the storyline, the acting, the scenery, the costumes, everything. I was so looking forward to getting this video. I was so disappointed when I realized that the editors of this movie cut out crucial scenes that were included in the televised movie. It's basically a choppy mess. Some of the edited out portions were subtle but I knew where the cuts were. A good movie should flow smoothly. For example, the story about Amin the beggar and Abrashield were entirely cut out. That's a crucial part of the movie. It's when the sultan realizes what his brother is doing to him. Without that part, the scene doesn't make sense. Two stars for this video, no stars for the editor."
3,botched culture nights,"Did anyone else find the glaring cultural mixups distracting? Interesting how they mixed Indian dance, Indian clothing, inauthentic clothing, English accents into this movie."
5,really fabulous story,"The stories are told in a really enchanting way, the atmosphere is extremely well rendered and the suspense is omnipresent. The intrigue is classic, but still you will be enchanted by the setting and the humour."
2,Dubious compilation - commercial attempt,"There are a lot of mistakes and unlikely phrases that lead me to believe that this publication was made for commercial purposes only. Students do not camp out for UVA-Duke football games - it's basketball (and I believe that there is a mail-in lottery now). No one calls UVA, U of V. Most of the student quotes are honest enough but were not all fact-checked. It looks like the researchers spent only a couple of days which is not enough for a school that is full of traditions and not routines. Maybe they only talked to the guides or college newspapers. Of course, no one is the complete expert of UVA! It is still a somewhat shameful reflection on Mr. Jefferson's University."
4,Very Useful,This book was VERY helpful in putting together my first science fair. If you need a resource with Wonderful and Useful information this is your book!
3,Cheaply made,Funny but could have chosen a more interesting plot. Storyline doesn't fit the age line of the characters. Just bad acting.
4,Does the Job,"We print pin fed post cards and labels for our newspaper. The printer was easy to set up but the instruction manual was a little vague is some areas and it is not 100% supported by Windows 7 as of this date. You do not want to use the installation disk that comes with the printer. You must just plug it in then start your computer and then let windows 7 find the driver that it has and wants to use. There are some directions that tell you to go to the EPSON site and download the other features for Epson Status Monitor for windows 7 , but you will find that those do not exist on the Epson site, so don't waste your time looking for it. The printer has operated as I expected and did the job I wanted it to do, so I am satisfied with it."
1,"Only headlight, No taillight as in the picture! Do not buy!!!","The picture is saying that this item includes a taillight, I set an order because of the picture, but I received only the headlight which is too big size for my bike. I contacted the seller, but reply from customer service of amazon says they don't have nothing to do with the picture. They wanted me to send it back in the original package, but I can't do it 'cause I threw them away, I thought they could send the taillight in a seperate package.Do not buy this headlight, it's huge and came in was a different color also."
5,Her First Was Always Her Best!,"This Album is just a work of art. Randy Crawford is always her best self...because she is always authenic. Her voice and style of music is to be savored. thank you Amazon. I've only been trying to get my hands of this...FOREVER. Now if you can just please help me get the Roberta Flack CD featuring Donny Hathaway (the one where she sings ""God Don't Like Ugly"") at a decent price...you'd make my year."
3,this product,"i purchased it for my 9 year old.it's an okay tambourine. the FIRST in the name is crucial to the buy.it's an alright beginner instrument, doesn't necessarily produce the sound that your ears want to hear."
2,Stupid design.,"This comes with two pads - permanent and semi-permanent. The semi-permanent pad has a goo on the back and leaves residue when removed. What is worse is when you put it aside dust and other stuff in the car sticks to it. The manufacturer warns the permanent pad is permanent so I have not used it.Update - I gave up using it. In really cold weather your saliva freezes and the whole unit falls onto your dash board. What a pile of junk.I bought the sandbag, which is 50 state legal, and love it."
4,A must for using Nuvi in many cars,"I bought this so that I can use my Nuvi in my cars and rental cars. Although the matching bean bag holder is pretty heavy, it was very convenient to use in a rental car in Europe and never slid or fell. Note that it must be used with the ""bean bag holder"" (to be bought separately and quite hard to find). The set up could be improved. The charger must be plugged at the back and the plug is hard to access on the mount. Also, I fear the mount is fragile if trying to remove it when its lock or lock it when its not properly inserted."
4,Garmin Mount for Nuvi,Designed for permanent or semi-permanent mounting - This mount is much less bulky than the window mount that comes with the Nuvi. Two adhesive pads come with the mount. One for semi-permanent and the other has a caution that it is very permanent. I started with the semi-perm but the mount fell off after a few hot days in Georgia. The permanent has been doing fine for weeks now and I have no problem recommending this mount. I have the Nuvi mounted low on my center console not on the top of my dash. It picks up a signal well and is out of obvious view
5,She loves it,My daughter loves her Disney Movies. Now we all get to hear her singing and dance around the house with her earbuds in.
5,fascinating,"220 x 160 mm, 352 pp, 205 illustrations: small, but of good quality. Brilliant text: lots of information and easy to read."
2,Falls down,When rolled in from the top the cans turn sideways and fall through the oversized slot on the top shelf. Place them through the bottom and some turn sideways and have to be repositioned.
2,Cans get stuck too easily.,Too much space for cans to get out of shape and stick in the back. Too much give side to side.
3,Plastic not the best choice,"I decided to get both a plastic dispenser and a wire dispenser. This being highly rated, was hoping for a really good performance. Here is what I noted1) The unit is tall, very tall when stacked, as it is designed to do. Stacking is really not an option for most refrigerators unless it is specific for drinks.2) They don't stack very well, difficult to get them to align and they will unstack very easy.3) When the volume gets low, the cans begin to hang up on the sides and twist in the track, effectively stopping them. Minor nuisance, easily corrected but still it happensOverall, my review is that you can do better. The metal one that I got is significantly better, lower in profile and cleaner in the delivery but cannot be stacked. Unless you really need to stack, stick with the wire one."
1,"Inspirational story, bad role model","Elisabeth Eliot's story is an uncritical, glamorous account of mission work and martyrdom in South America. Her admirable devotion to her young husband however leads to shaky theology and bad relationship advice (especially to young women). Elisabeth sees Jim as the template for Christian masculinity. She paints an impressive (but inaccurate) picture of him, and then implies to that the Eliot route to marriage and vocation is the only valid christian one. Eliot counsels against dating, and yet dated Jim. Jim committed to marriage and fatherhood -- a commitment higher than missionary work -- and then, in my view, failed his family by living the Pauline life of a single missionary man.By all means, read her books. But remember that they are not the Bible. Read them prayerfully and critically."
3,When a Believer Marries a Nonbeliever,"The point made for living a joy-filled life as a Christian. Also, the part about self-esteem is good coming from a Christian perspective versus a world view.The Kindle version, a lot of words running together, but I am becoming very good at pulling the words apart. I have encountered this before but not to the degree in this download. Any suggestions?"
5,Enviro fireplace plug worked great.,"I have a very small brick fireplace and I was able to manage to use this plug, which appears to be sized for a much larger chimney, without any problems. It was easy to set up and I no longer have any draft coming down the fireplace. After a day I can already tell that the furnace is turning on less often. I ended up buying this through ace hardware's website since there i have the option to have it delivered to my nearest ace hardware for free delivery. Also, I ordered it online Thursday night and i got a call from ace hardware the following Saturday that it was there ready for pickup. One more thing, It is really easy to take down and put back in when you want to use your fireplace.Anyhew this is a great product and if you have a drafty fireplace I would really recommend it."
1,poor design and build quality,"This plug seemed like such a great idea, but the product's poor design makes it only marginally useful. The poles supporting the plug do not fit together well and do a poor job of positioning and stabilizing the balloon in the firebox. And the end caps that are supposed to cap the poles do not remotely fit. Even when you can get it positioned in the right spot after a long period of adjusting it, the balloon's design tends to make it twist in upon itself, creating gaps along the sides. So, it does block some airflow, but sticking anything up the chimney would stop some airflow too. This design needs another generation or two to work the bugs out."
4,Pretty good product,"This product effectively reduces drafts caused by open fire place flues. I use in a fire place that I have removed the gas burning element and replaced with an electric element. It works well, it does not create a perfect seal, at least not in my case. However, it is a huge improvement. It also reduces the air-traffic noise from the airport. All in all, a very good investment."
1,Stay away from this one,"When I played this CD I was hugely disappointed to learn that the songs are NOT SUNG BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS. And the songs are not as good, and the recording quality poor. There was no way to find out that the songs were not sung by the original artists until I actually opened the CD.[....] Stay away!!!"
5,"People of the Wolf (The First North Americans series, Book 1)",I've loved everything I've read by the Gears and I've read just about everything they have published. Wonderful interposing of fiction onto the facts! They use their expertise as anthropologists and as story tellers to combine what really has been found about North American Indians and interpose a very believable story onto it. They really make the past come alive! The inclusion of what has really been found by anthropologists adds tremendously to the books!
3,Hard to start -- Well worth the effort!,Started with Jean Auel series. Wanted to read something similar. This was very interesting and the characters were brought to life. Can't wait to read the next in the series.
1,"Cofee Filter ""gimmick","Having been a user of this type of kitchen gadget and not being able to find it anymore I was thrilled to find it available and purchased two of them. However they are not what I had before, that ws very usefull. ThThese were complete junk and skimmed over the top of the filers. My husband tried to adjust and finally we put them in the garbage and were will never order them again obviously!"
2,I'm very disappointed...,"When I think of a classic then I think of something that holds true regardless of time. This book is a bit outdated (it was written in 1930). A third of the book is concerning the analysis of mining and railroad companies.Plus the book was very rudimentary in its writings. Not really a book on speculation as an introductary book for a 1930's investor. In my opinion not worthy of the term ""Classic""If you want a true classic read ""Reminences of a Stock Operator"" This is a true classic with truths that hold true today as well as 1923 when it was written."
3,Why is this a classic? Please help...,"There are good bits and bad bits to Phillip Caret's classic. The bits on balance sheets, P&Ls and what makes the difference between investment and speculation are very good. His style is tight and unambiguous. The message is clear. The bad side is that I found it boring and not at all the 24-carat prose that is claimed in the introduction.Wiley has many great books in its Investment Classics series. This isn't one of them."
1,Horrible! and won't even tune!,"The favorable reviews on this guitar must be from the manufacturer, independent seller or from buyers who don't know how to play guitar. I've been playing guitar for over 10 years. We got this one for our niece for x-mas and i spent 30 minutes trying to tune it to no avail.do not buy this junker! Spend about 30 or 40 more dollars and by a Squier or a Johnson."
2,Not satisfied,"When i ordered it i was very excited to get it. It came the day after the estimated day and when i recieved it wasnt very impressed. I had issues tuning it so i brought it in to get tuned when the store tuner said it wasnt even a real guitar right away i sent an e-mail to return it back and get a refund. I was over all disapointed in this item. The gig bag was awful, the guitar itself was okay but the strings were too high off the guitar and because of that i could not play any of the chords."
4,great for starters,"This guitar is priced great for someone just trying get familiar with a guitar, When I received it, I took it to get restrung with high quality chords and had it tuned. My daughter loves it specially the color. The vendor did an awesome job on getting the order out so quick."
3,not very sturdy,"had never purchased any hotwheels playsets before and probally won't for a few more years. bought this for my four year olds birthday, does not seem too safe due to the fact that it zips these metal cars around and if the head is not pointed straight they just fly everywhere,and if the plastic ramp is not held up when his mouth gets full he won't open his mouth and spit the toys out because the car has to be pointed in a certain way to make a lever release and his mouth open, has alot of small parts for a four year old to remember where they go, definetly a toy that would require constant supervision with a young child, were taking it back today and buying something more sturdier"
5,Excellent!!!,"For those who have read the Twilight Series you will love the story of Jameson, who you've read about so often! For those who haven't get them all. This is the best vampire romance series I have ever read. This book held me captive as all Maggie Shayne's do. I urge everyone to read this as well as the rest of the books! You won't regret it!!!! If you're looking for the others I found mine at a used bookstore."
3,Born in Twilight,"Born in Twilight tells the story of Jameson. The little boy we first met in Twilight Phantasies (Wings in the Night #1), is all grown up and not sure if he wants to be turned or not. Angelica is a newly turned vampire on her own with no one to teach her. She takes Jameson without realizing what she is doing and leaves him for dead. Now, as you can tell from the blurb on the book - Angelica ends up pregnant with Jameson's child, but I don't want to give away too many of the specifics - let's just say that the bad guys have a hand in the whole thing.This was not my favorite of the series so far. Jameson got on my nerves with his super macho attitude and the religious symbolism was a little over the top. I did love to see how all the characters from the past books played their own role in the story without taking away from the romance budding between Angelica and Jameson. I also enjoyed seeing how the little boy I grew to love in Twilight Phantasies turned out all grown up."
5,4:50 from Lehigh,It's quite a shame that the yanks haven't got better public transport. Imagine witnessing a murder on the way to Sebring on passing cars in the night.
3,Thumbs down on editing!,"I have to agree with reviewer John Prentice's attitude on editing. I hate it! I have some old VHS tapes that I made from PBS when they first aired Miss Marple. They were my old friends. Then when A&E started showing the series, you could tell that they had been cut. Bummer! Sometimes the scenes that were cut were important to the continuity of the plot. Another one that was edited that really griped me was ANNE OF GREEN GABLES. I ask WHY????"
2,"Great series, but...","The BBC's MISS MARPLE series is at last getting a DVD release, but A&E aren't giving it the launch that it deserves. The picture quality of these four discs vary greatly, and no clean-up work appears to have been done, (some sections of the films are full of dirt and specs). Although all the MISS MARPLE stories are available in both episodic and feature-length formats, only one of these adventures is as originally braodcast on the BBC, (THE MIRROR CRACK'D): the other three seem to have been compiled from their respective two-part versions - leading to new, video-generated captions for the story titles, (which rather ruin the effect of the wonderful opening sequence). Further more, 4.50 FROM PADDINGTON lacks about three minutes of footage, (nothing very important, but irritating).Surely A&E could spend just that little bit extra, get some new transfers from the BBC and release programmes properly???"
5,Wonderful,"This series of movies were very entertaining! Good ""Who Done Its"". Hours of entertainment at a reasonable price. DVD's arrived in very good condition and were shipped promptly."
4,a perfect Miss Marple,"Joan Hickson was a very fine Miss Marple, seemingly fragile, but possessed of a keen intelligence & great powers of observation! As with a number of older BBC productions, however, the audio was not always the best, making it difficult to hear & understand the dialog without having the volume turned way up. You would think this issue would be addressed by whoever puts out these programs on DVD."
3,Quality seems uneven,"Good selections of stories, with fine entertainment value. Not all are equally crisp and clear. We were disappointed in not having captions. I'll pay more attention to that in descriptions from now on!"
3,Zydeco Virgin,I have heard Zydeco here and there and have enjoyed it's sound. This CD is not what I expected ... but worth a listen! It's kind of a mix between traditional and updated Zydeco.
5,The Real Deal,"I had (and well used) this book for years and then lost it in during a series of moves I had to make a couple years ago. Can't wait to have it back on my shelf again.I love Chinese food, and have read and sampled from dozens of Chinese cookbooks over the years, but this is still my favorite. How To Cook And Eat In Chinese is the real deal.It is chock full of simple, no nonsense, homestyle Chinese cooking with the most basic of ingredients you can find anywhere. Almost all the recipes have variations noted, where different vegetables or ingredients can be substituted in the technique. Results have been invariably superb.Forget the fancy, restaurant or holiday banquet style stuff other cookbooks seem addicted to. Simplify your Chinese cooking, and your life. Your pocketbook, taste buds and your stomach will thank you for it."
4,"Didn't fit exactly, but...","Really didn't fit well... or actually at all. With the proper application of a bench grinder and a little measuring, I was able to modify it to fit. I have these on a Land Rover and they popped in and fit great right out of the box, but this set required modification. To make it work required cutting about 1.5"" off the lower end and reshaping it."
4,An excellent place to start,"Sheldrake's ideas, while controverial are an excellent place to add to anyone's ongoing exploration of Metaphysics. I agree with a previous reviewer in that these ideas can be interpreted using old terminology. Instead I have found it better to synthesize Sheldrake's excellent works with David Bohm, and any other relevant source I can find. Where do these Morphic fields come from? That is the truly interesting question."
3,"Good the first time, not a second","The first time I read this book I thought that it was great. I loved how it was tragic and romantic and I thought the hero was great in a dark brooding kind of way. The second time was not so good. I picked it up not realizing I had read it a long time ago and even though I realized it pretty early on, I kept reading it anyway. I wouldn't recommend doing that. It didn't hit me with any emotional impact at all. The sex scenes were the only reason I actully finished it."
3,okay,"It was okay, not her best work, I don't like her historical works that much thought this would be good, but it was just okay"
5,"Liza with a ""Z"" DVD review",Was so happy that this item is now available on DVD. What a great show. I especially enjoyed the commentary provided on the disc.
5,Oh wow!,Amazing... I was born 5 years after this aired on TV and had not really heard too much about it. This was a fabulous surprise! As a fan of Fosse and Liza this was a visual dream. I would absolutely have to agree that she is a perfect interpreter of all the signature Fosse moves and mannerisms. Sonically this was restored to perfection and her voice is so clear and dynamic. I would highly recommend this to her fans (obviously) and to people who are not very familiar with Liza and her whole scene as so many theatrical elements were executed to the 9's.
5,All Liza,This DVD was great. It arrived in my mailbox very quickly and was exactly as described. Liza is a living legend and seeing her as she was 30 years ago was a big treat. I recently saw her in concert and she still puts on a wonderful show! I enjoyed this immensely.
5,Quilts for Chocolate Lovers,"The author was our guest at a Quilt Guild meeting in September and we did a project out of this book...loved the author, class and the project. Great book, well detailed."
1,Do I live by the airport?,"This fan is load. When my water cooler had a leak I stuck this fan in. I like water cooling but its not worth the up keep, and this fan is way to load for a living room computer.I'm ditching the BTX and buying a ATX with the V1. I'm sure glad I thought ahead and originally bought a case that can be used with either ATX or BTX form-factors."
5,Green City in the Sun,"The first Barbara Woods book I read, and became hooked with her and in love with Kenya. Its a great read!!!!!!"
1,Didn't work.,"This was the first Cinemax movie I ever watched when I was a teen, so I was very excited when I saw I could buy this. But I have three DVD players and it didnt work in any of them. I'm not going to return it because for seven bucks it's not worth the time. Very dissapointed."
4,WORTH CHECKING OUT,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD AND REALLY ENJOYED IT, IT HAS A BASIC PLOT BUT PLENTY OF NUDITY AND SOFT-CORE SEX WHICH IS THE REASON YOU BUY A STRIPPER MOVIE TO BEGIN WITH WHILE THE ACTING LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED, THE GIRLS ARE SEXY AND SHOW JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO SEERAZORBACK FAN"
4,super julia takes the big easy,"the bad news is: the premise is ludicrous, the government opperatives are idiots and if the cia really hires bad guys like these, we're doomed. the good news is, i have every bad habit known to movie lovers and can still enjoy the fast pace, likeable characters and overall entertainment value of this yarn. sure, cub scout investigators don't trip over the biggest murder conspiracy since hoffa, but hey! it's julia roberts at her sickly sweet best. perversion has it's rewards."
3,Pelican Brief,"The movie is good, but the setup for DVD is ridiculous. It's two sided and you have to flip over everytime. It's not in the 21st Century."
3,The book!,The book was far better than the movie. To fast without understanding. I enjoyed reading it much more than the movie.
2,Quality of DVD is extremely poor.,"The quality of this DVD, The Pelican Brief, is very, very poor. The vast majority of the film is so dark that neither the characters nor the scenes can be viewed...the screen is practically pitch black, with no images.I will not be buying anymore DVDs from Amazon, due to the extremely poor quality of this single DVD, which I had so looked forward to receiving."
1,ripoff,"Bought the first and it only had half the movie recorded. Like an idiot I bought another ... Same damn thing*!!! Screw me once shame on you, screw ma twice shame on me. I will buy nothing more from Amazon till this is fixed!!!!"
2,not for me,"I know a lot of people enjoy this movie. And it is suppose to be a big movie. But I don't understand it. The reason I don't understand it is because the beginning bores me right away. I've tried watching this movie four times from the binning till the middle I start it over. When the movie starts and there is nothing but talk, I lose interest. So I have know Idea what this movie is about."
1,Bought and Returned,"I bought this, but deleted from my Kindle books because I could not readily find the Table of Contents. What a disappointment!"
2,Hard to follow,Always heard about the man and the book but it was difficult trying to follow and understand. Gave up three quarters of the way through. Did learn a little something though.
1,Not worth purchasing,"Very poor video content - skip this one. Limited footage keeps repeating. Missed lots of opportunities for a great video. Seems to be a ""green"" promotion only and not even very good at that."
5,Overlooked masterpiece,"I wasn't expecting much from this. Ho hum, I thought, yet another math/noise/chaoti-core band. I was right, in a way, since they are very similar to a lot of other Dillinger-worshipping bands of late. But, wow, do they do it well. I'm not as awed but this as I am by DEP, but I like it better, and will probably listen to it a lot more. Maybe my eardrums are warped, but I actually find it very catchy. They understand the importance of tone--I think I can hear a lot of Voivod influence in there. They seem to use some of the same weird chords, with even an occasional spacey moment here and there, and this is what makes this album for me. Such a great sound! And they vary the pace--one moment super fast, the next slower and more contemplative--something you don't see very much in music of this kind. Their sound reminds me a lot of the Swiss band Knut, except I think these guys are a little better. Another great band from Relapse."
2,Lengthy and irritating,"This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either. Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess."
2,complain,"The technical information states that Subtitles in English were available. The set I got has no such specification. The contents, however, are very good"
3,Frodo,"A nice looking figure and a good face sculpt, but disappointing in some ways. Foremost is that it does not stand up on its own, as the legs are oddly formed in a sort of ""action"" pose that, despite bending the joints, never lend themselves to both feet flat at once. Thus the figure ends up bent forward oddly or some such by the time it quits tipping over. Still and all, a nice addition to a collection if you just have something to sort of prop him a bit. I'd not recommend this for a lot of active play, but rather a display piece."
4,All and all a winner,"Great movie, highly recommend.The only caution that I can think of is language. It was much stronger than I had anticipated, and would caution you if that is something you have trouble with, beware.Make sure to watch the historical documentary in the DVD extras section."
4,A Great Story that had to be told.,"A great cast - Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, Tobey Maguire and Elizabeth Banks just soar in this well told story. It'll tug at your heart strings, and you'll thank them for it."
1,Horrible Movie,"Though many may say this movie is good I must resent them because this movie was horrible. The plot didn't make sense and Toby McGuire didn't put on a beliving act and don't get me started on the horse...! The other people though we barely saw them made me laugh at their bad acting. I hope you people out there put this review in consideration, so you won't spend so much money on a movie that makes you want to want Pokemon! Yes, the movie was the bad. Don't bother with this movie unless you want a good sleep. This movie [stinks] on ice.Thank You for taking the time out of your busy schedule."
4,Great Uplifting Drama,"Toby Maguire and Jeff Bridges star in this factually based picture about a financially struggling racehorse owner and unknown jockey who battle all odds with and old neglected nag and end up winning the Kentucky Derby. I don't mind giving that tidbit away because the ending is a plain as can be from about 2 minutes into the movie. However, that's where the complaints end - it's well acted, very enjoyable, and impressively filmed in all senses, and although it won't I'm sure set anyone's world ablaze, it is one of the better offerings on DVD of late. The widescreen is a must for the racing scenes, and one or two nice extra's on the DVD, outweigh the VHS option. Enjoy"
1,DVD that does not work,"I ordered this film to show in March. When I finally got around to watching it, it did not work in any DVD I tried."
2,Not very exciting or acurate,"Toby McGuire was not impressive in this movie. As far as I can remember, the acting was okay, but Toby just doesn't fit the charector of a jockey.I am a huge lover of horses and at first couldn't wait to see it, but when I did I was dissapointed. Not only was it relatively dull and boring, but my cousin and I started laughing out loud when we saw two horses being put in a stall together. Anyone who knows horses would know this is absolutely disasterous. This just goes to show that the movie was innacurate and made by someone who doesn't know equines.There is nothing outstanding about this movie, don't waste your time."
2,"Not really a movie, but that's not the worst of it","I hope this doesn't signal Jeff Bridge's ride into the sunset. There is surprisingly little dialog in this movie - mostly just history-channel style narration between TV-commercial quality moments of action. The cinematogrophy is excellent on the track, it's way too artifical off it. Better rented than owned."
5,Seabisquit,Bought this movie for my granddaughter to watch....It arrived very fast and she loved it....She has watched it several times..........
2,Seabiscuit,"The Movie is off quite a lot. first, war admril is not that tall only about four inches tall than seabiscuit. second, Seabiscuit's jockey was smaller and war admirls was bigger. third seabiscuit is not a great race horse, he only one 3 races war admirl was undefeted otherwise then when him and Seabiscuit raced. this movie is not very accurete. There is more about the people than the horses in this movie"
3,"He was hot, she was not","I read this book based on the reviews on this site and I don't think it was as fantastic as they are making it out to be.The storyline itself was predictable and there were few surprises. However, I did fall in love with Captain Sutherland. I liked how he was such a brute, but took good care of Nicole. Nicole, on the other hand, was annoying as hell. She was a spoiled brat and didn't have much regard for anyone's feelings accept her own. I hated how she couldn't trust Sutherland. Even toward the end! It drove me bananas!This wasn't the best romance I have ever read, but considering it only took me one day to read, I'd recommend it to the average sap. :P"
4,looking forward to more,"This was a good book. Now that I have read several of Kresley Cole's books I can say I just like her style and LOVE her sex scenes. She's the best when it comes to that. I could use just a bit more humor in her books but overall this is a good book if you like sexual tension, possessive men and steamy love scenes."
5,With a Little Surprise!,"There is more than one version of this cd. When I got the cd, there were TWO in the jewel case. The other is DVD. All the rest I have seen have just one disc. I sure lucked out! I am late coming to Blackmore's Night, but I like the ones I have heard so far. I came across 3 of the songs used for Robin of Sherwood videos on Youtube. I am so pleased at finding this wonderful sound. Ritchie had come a long way from Rainbow, and I do believe that Claire brings out the best in him. I highly recommend this version of cd with two discs!"
3,Good,"Strangely, although this CD is helpful, I find the doctor's voice very irritating so it interferes with the relaxation benefit."
2,A comparative waste of time,"Readable adolescent sci-fi from an author who has done much better work. There are good ideas here and some likeable characters, but most of the good stuff is is insufficiently developed and subordinated to the rather psychotic, stunted viewpoints of a couple of main characters. We sort-of care about the characters - but not as much as we could. Meanwhile, the conflicts seem increasingly shallow as we learn more about them. Many events seem unnecessarily contrived, and the final resolution is unsatisfactory.If I sound disgruntled, it's because I really like this author and felt let down by Kingdom. This novel doesn't measure up to her earlier rough-but-thought-provoking Reclamation, her excellent Fool's War and Playing God, or (my favorite) Quiet Invasion. By comparison, this one is a waste of time."
3,Reasonable book but you can probably get this info with less expense,"I am a professional admissions counselor [...] and have used this book to keep myself abreast of the latest in medical school admissions. The information is accurate and organized, and it is a good basic summary. If you are willing to do a little work on your own, however, you can acquire this broad-based information less expensively using the internet, the AMCAS web site and other free sources. Also, portions of the book are interesting but may be inconsequential to most applicants.M. Finkel, Insider Medical Admissions"
2,Meh.,"This book is supposed to be so great, but as the parent of a newborn, it's not helpful at all. I have no idea what's accurate and what information should have been updated. For example, my daughter had a tongue tie that was preventing her from latching correctly, and the lactation doctor's snipping it a few days ago has made SUCH a difference. Yet Penelope Leach says that tongue ties can be ignored for the first year. Also Leach says stools are very different colors for the first month and just to relax, but we've been told elsewhere that violent green frothy poop explosions mean that the baby is just getting foremilk, not hindmilk, and could explain why she wants the breast >20 times a day. These are important things to include!I was given this book by someone whom I really respect, and I've heard the child development stuff is good, so I'l give it 2 starts for that, but right now I wish I'd used my limited awake/not-doing-baby-laundry-time to read something more useful."
3,Wordy and refences too many case studies from 1983,"For a book that I thought would be organized by what to expect at each stage of infancy, I found it much too wordy - skipping alot of paragraphs that refer to case studies and other psychologists - there are many other books by Penelope Leach that are easier reading...especially parents who don't have alot of time to read!"
2,Wordy Rambler,"While Penelope Leach's other book was refreshing with new common sense insights onto my little one's behavior, this book is much to wordy. I suspect it was written as a PhD thesis as it reads about as exciting as one. It is very wordy and seems to ramble. I lose interest long before I discover any new useful info."
3,"""We Are Going to Be Kicking a Monolithic Habit""","The Grid's debut album is atmospheric yet uneven techno-pop. Long out of print, ""Electric Head"" (1990) contains a few Hits That Never Were: the immensely danceable ""A Beat Called Love,"" ""This Must Be Heaven"" and ""Floatation."" Amidst the erratic experimentation are hidden gems such as ""Driving Instructor,"" ""Strange Electric Sun"" and ""Intergalactica."" Never released in America, this British import has attracted a cult following in recent years."
4,Loved it! Can't wait for the next one!,This was sooooo awesome! I think that anyone who hasn't read it yet and is a Thoroughbred fan has definately got to read it!
1,Disappointing,I am great fan of Sherlock Holmes and of Christopher Lee. I regret buying this DVD - th B&W; movie looks all washed out - the dubbing is comically bad and the voices - to rob Christopher Lee of his voice - borders on the criminal.I could not even finish watching it - its that bad!Don't buy this - even if you are a fan of the Great Detective.
4,I love Dar's music!,Dar's music is one of the best things I have ever heard. She knows how to epitomize life in her lyrics. Everything that she sings about is as true as it can ever get
5,A wish fulfilled,... I'm the proud owner of set1 of this video which keepsme glued to the telly whenever the video is played.The thememusic is thrilling and sets the pace for a fast paced episode.Patrick Mcgoohan aptly fits into the title role.I could only wishthat the full 48 episodes are published and the danger man fanshave a larger collection to play over and over rather than risking damage to their cherished single set.
4,Good enough for me!,"This music stand is flimsy and wobbly, fragile and difficult to adjust. But it does the job, and it's cheap, too. If you need a portable stand to hold some music, hey, it ain't bad. If you need something more fancy, look elsewhere."
4,One of its few samples,"Considering how largely populated the Spanish-speaking world is, the Spanish translation of Koran, the Holy Book of Islam, a fundamental religion in the world, is essential. Spanish Koran is very hard to find, though, which makes a majority of the world unable to acquire the information contained within. The contents and verses of Koran are unchanged and original throughout its history. This Spanish translation is a gift to Spanish-speaking people. I congratulate the translator, the publishers, and Amazon.com."
2,Caution: Not Their Arrangements!,"This is a good songbook if you don't know these songs at all, but what I was hoping for was Manhattan Transfer arrangements of them. For instance, their recorded cool version of ""Body & Soul"" in which they sing Coleman Hawkins's famous solo, has not only notes but words; the original version, the ""head"", isn't what they sing. I was hoping to see what they sang in print, hence, I thought, the title of this songbook; however, this book only has the original refrains of all of 'em! So if you were hoping to see what they actually sing, forget it; hope I just saved you money (that I spent.)"
2,Rushed-to-lame?,I don't think the facts support the movie. A bank break-in like this one should not be as corney/lame as this flick goes... 'The Cops are Robbers' is a very good read and true as it was written by one of the more interesting members of the bunch. Get the book.
5,Loved the entire series,Only problem I had with this entire series of books is that the series ends. Loved the history and the story teller. Using the books to plan my trip to Egypt in the not to distant future....
3,boromir is good and bad,"boromir is good and bad.he has great detial and all his joints work well after my brother and i have played with him for most of the day after we got him. his face is pretty close to the actual actor. he also has a few problems: first,it is very hard to make him stand properly and he can't sit right at all. another bad thing about him is that the button on his back doesn't make him do anything. and finally, no matter how hard i push, i can't get his sword to fit in his hand. it is just to big.i hope my reiew was helpful!"
2,What happened to copy editing?,Not sure who edited or published this version of the book but it is filled to the gills with messed up sentences and typos. So much so that I had to quit reading it.. and I was actually really interested in finishing.
5,My All Time Favorite Book,"This book is on my laptop and my Kindle and I read it over and over again. I dip in and out on a regular basis. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) is the best pure writer in my personal experience and while I read this book, I have to stop now and then and try to absorb what I just read. It makes me want to go there and the sweep of history is so visible in this book. I love the part where he says that once you have seen the landscapes, you understand why three of the world's great religions started there. I read this book over and over and recommend it every chance I get."
5,seven pillars of wisdom,"Product arrived on time,in mint condition. I especially liked the books large readable size. As I child I saw ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and enjoyed the action and cinematic action of the film. Now I enjoyed the book for its philosophy and poetic literary style.It is especially relevant today to understand the Eastern Mindset in a word where our relations with the Middle East are pivotal."
1,A complaint from a customer,"HEY! How about taking out any reviews that give away keys parts of the plot, such as which central characters die? Why would I want to see a movie once I know this?"
3,not too bad,"First of all, I'd just like to say that it angers me that skinheads are constantly portrayed as racists in movies. Being an anti-racist skinhead, and knowing that the vast majority of skinheads aren't racist, this fact upsets me. That being said, I still thought this was a good movie. I hadn't seen any Russell Crowe films before, and I was very impressed with his performance in this one. The movie has very little plot though, it mostly just shows a few days in the life of a gang of boneheads, and the violence and hatred that is their existence. Believe me, it's not an easy movie to watch, but if you want something different, and in the vein of A Clockwork Orange, you may want to check this out."
4,GREAT flick!,"A great film that shows the reality of racial violence from both sides of the spectrum! ""Brutally"" entertaining. Unfortunately, too many consider movies such as this as promoting prejudice & violence."
3,no better than average,"There's never really been a comprehensively good movie about skinheads. There'sAmerican History X, of course, but the movie has an unsatisfying finale. As does this movie, Russell Crowe's breakthrough film about a gang of skinheads in Australia.Though it gets off to a great and shocking start and begins to capably explore the Gabrielle's background, by the final third the movie has degenerated into nothing more than a garden-variety love-triangle flick. This director really had the chance to say something meaningful about his characters and what drove them to their high-velocity lifestyles, but I don't think he was able to come up with anything coherent."
3,"moments of brilliance/ overall, nothing amazing","There are moments of brilliance in this film - the editing, the music, and the action sequences are often beautifully pieced together. Those moments show a lot of promise for this director. However, with that said, there's not much to this film.I never once became emotionally involved with any of the characters. Without the emotional connection, the scenes of violence are just that, scenes - two dimensional visions of a brutal subject, racism of the utmost extreme.I really don't understand all the hype about Crowe's acting; there just wasn't anything engaging.""Mississippi Burning"" is a far more powerful exploration of racism."
3,worked okay for morning sickness.,The product worked okay for morning sickness. not sure I would purchase again except for placebo effect.
4,pseudo-symphonic-weird-dorkestration,"My personal favorite residents release... NOT AVAILABLE is the ultimate in pseudo-symphonic-weird-dorkestration (you can quote me on that one)... there are only 5 tracks clocking in at 35:31 minutes... which should give you the accurate impression that the pieces are long and winding (at times, nearly incoherent)... consisting of multiple twists and turns within each track drawing the listener further away from reality into a bizarro world with cut-and-paste composition... like most residents albums, this one includes a multitude of feelings and emotions, etc (humor, darkness, touching melodies, over-all strangeness)... NOT AVAILABLE is not for those whom expect the short COMMERCIAL ALBUM/DUCK STAB version of the residents avant-pop... this album leans more toward extended avant-classical-jazz (with a touch of nursery rhyme for good measure)..."
3,"Blue Seed, worthwile, but not necessary","While not a title i was initially looking forward to, Blue Seed has earned itself a spot in my anime collection. Still its not a title I hang for come it's release date, it serves as adequete padding when I need just one more item to complete an order. The story thus far is proving rather episodic but it has some good characters that helps to keep ones attention. I cant say i really love this series, but it does make for an entertaining nights viewing. The Omake (bomus extras) segments are hilarious and make for even better value when conisdering this order. Video quality is grainy and washed out, but this due to the age of this series (coming on close to 8years now). The animation quality on the whole however is great and very pleasing to the eye. With 6 episodes on this release it's a bargin for sure, and a worthwhile addition to anyones anime collection."
5,Fearless on Everest,"Julie Summers sensitive telling of the story of Sandy Irvine is not only a great read, but is written with intelligence, grace and wit. Irvine's personality looms large in the book, and the reader is easily captivated by his infectious personality. Explorer, lover, adventurer, journalist -- one can easily imagine Summer's Irvine on the silver sceen, portrayed by Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson. This wonderful book will be enjoyed by climbers, mountaineers, armchair explorers and laypeople alike. A real tour de force, the only question that arises after reading is: who is going to option it, and when is the movie coming out?"
2,There's something missing!,"I'm afraid this collection lacks one of the best songs this group has ever made, ""Different Seasons"". It's a relief that ""Foolish Heart"" made it! I wished they didn't add those two remix versions ... it makes the collection cheap."
5,my little pirate is happy,My daughter wanted to be a pirate for Halloween... & I wanted something simple to put on yet doesn't look cheap... she's 4 years old & the small size jut fit perfectly... I think it will still fit her for next year too... it's cute & I drew an eye patch with facial colors & it turned out perfect! i just wish it would've come with a sward!!!
4,Pull no punches....,What can you say...this album is great. It has gotten me through many a long drive. If your going to buy any Big Black this is the one.
3,Good Movie to supplement Geology unit in Middle School!!!,I bought this product to show to my 8th grade science class. They were learning information about the Earth's layers and the Earth's magnetic field. The movie gave them a lot of information and it was interesting to them. After the movie I had them discuss whether this all could actually happen which connected the information and the movie to real life nicely. Movie takes about 4 40 minute periods to complete.
1,Wish I could give this zero stars,"This movie is awful on every level. Diologue, acting, special effects, direction, what else is there? It isn't even suspensful. I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen"
2,HuH ??,"ahhh what did i watch? i felt like i was eating bad takeout. deep impact had a better story than this one , but the wonderful grace that saved this film from being a total bomb is the special effects in it. if you're curious then rent it, you'll be glad you save some money then paying dearly later on. they should've made this into a comedy it would've been better."
2,How dumb is this movie?,"How dumb is this movie? Let me count the ways. No, wait. I cannot count that high. But let me try anyway. This movie is so dumb I almost stopped watching it (more than once). This movie is so dumb I regretted spending nearly 4 dollars to rent it. This movie is so dumb the dialog reads like it was written in a high school drama class. This movie is so dumb the acting appears to be taken from a Saturday afternoon 1950s Sci-Fi movie convention. I could go on and on. But won't. Simply avoid this movie like the plague."
1,"Tepid, campy actioner","""The Core"" is a cinematic nightmare, remniscent of such classics as....Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon""? The film screams bad plotting and a ridiculous premise to boot. Unfortunately for those looking for a revitalizing thriller within the canon of new action releases, this film does not suffice by any means. Utterly unrealistic, taudry, and unbearably long. Do not waste your time."
5,I enjoy scifi movies and great actors. This had both. The core had a story line that you could follow.,"I loved the story line. I really love all the actors, too. I'm not a techi but I could understand some of the things they were doing."
2,Really poor,"This film is a great example of an awful Hollywood blockbuster. Its hangs together on the worst kind of cliches, and as previous reviewers have said, has no scientific basis at all. At the start its not that bad. The crew of a space shuttle have to land in the middle of L.A. because of the start of the Earths core slowing down, which leads the Shuttles guidance systems astray. This is done quite well although the CGI special effects aren't that great. From there its a rapid decent, excuse the pun.The film is reminisent of Armageddon in style, and amazingly probably not as good, because its even more scientifically unlikely. Quite why Hilary Swank decided to do this film is beyond me. However she and Bruce Greenwood (so good in Thirteen Days as JFK) are the only redeeming features. If you loved Armegeddon you will probably love this, so if in doubt rent it first!"
1,Unrecognizable.,"This movie shipped with 3 other movies. The other movies worked just fine, however this disc had several scratches and is unrecognized by my disc player (xbox 360). The disc was securely fastened in the dvd case so it did not get damaged during shipment. I realize that there is an inherent risk in buying used dvds but I wish that the description was either reduced to less than good condition or that the disc be inspected and sent in the ""Very Good"" condition that was expected. The amount it cost me wouldn't be worth sending back but for all intensive purposes this disc is useless garbage to me."
4,Entertaining,"We watched this with the whole family as a New Years Eve actitvity while waiting for midnight to roll around. Intersting premise, but the story leaves a few holes as far as believablity goes, but hey, that's why it's called science fiction. Good acting and special effects, decent story, very little offensive language makes this a very watchable movie."
1,Just Plain Horrible,"I couldn't even finish this movie. There is nothing good to say about it. The scene where the main character is explaining the basic geological structure of the Earth and is talking about the ""Inner core and outer core"" and then asks if everyone is following him epitomizes the ridiculous nature of this flick. A first grader could have been following him. The writing is horrible, the acting worse and the special effects are just plain poor. Avoid this one at all costs."
1,The Core too stupid to believe............,"Worse movie ever. It actually started off pretty good but I lost interest as soon as they hatched the ridiculous plan to get to the core.The plot got dumber from there. I can't handle movies where they re-write science to fit the movie makers vision.I don't even remember how it ended but I remember being relieved that it did.The Core was a bore and it's science was poor, no less, no more..."
4,Fun Movie,"This movie was panned by the critics which immediately gave it credibility as good entertainment. Critics don't care if a movie is fun for the audience - they only care if it was a challenge for the actors. Hilary Swank wasn't going to win another academy award for this move but it was 10 times the fun to watch this movie then the movie she did win one for. Great special effects, Action, comibined with a science fiction theme and a great supporting cast make this a fun flick. The only downer was a lack of solid romance and humor. Those two ingredients would have put this movie over the top. If you like action science fiction - this is the movie for you."
1,I want my 134 minutes of life Back!,"No really,If I would of died a minute after watching this film, I would of been so pissed that my last 2 hours of life was wasted watching THIS!"
1,The Bore,"YAWN!!! What a ridiculous insult of a movie!!! If you enjoyed this, you probably either collect Pokemon cards, or you think Limp Bizkit is the ""koolest"" guy on Earth. This is convulted and contrived."
3,The Core,"After first seeing trailers of the movie for the first time, I thought that it could turn out to be a very interesting movie. I didn't really care about how it could never happen, or how the science didn't make sense, or how everyone else judged it based on science, not the movie itself. I saw the movie, ready for a silly story about the core not spinning and the world being in chaos. Walking out of the theater, I said, ""Ehh, I've seen better."" Overall, the movie was interesting, but not one I would want to see over and over. Therefore, rent the movie if you haven't seen it already, but don't waste your money on this movie."
3,A run-of-the-mill legal thriller.,"""A Jury of Her Peers"" is a mediocre legal thriller about a dedicated public defender named Sybylla Muldoon. Sybylla devotes her life to helping her indigent clients, even though she receives very little appreciation for her efforts. While defending a homeless client who has slashed and maimed a nine-year-old girl, Sybylla learns of a nefarious right-wing plot to undermine the jury system. While investigating this plot, Sybylla places her life in jeopardy and she uncovers some horrible secrets concerning her parents. Does this sound impossibly complicated and far-fetched? Well, it is. Although the author gets credit for creating Sybylla, who is an attractive and witty individual, the mystery gets more and more preposterous as the book wears on. Ultimately, the sometimes witty dialogue and the compelling courtroom scenes do not make up for the weak and implausible story."
3,Raw energy,If your looking for the trade mark Pogue style from SRL and Grace you won't find it here. What you will find is the raw talent and energy that made the Pogues a great band. If you like pub music this is a must. The sound enginering is a bit off but the performances more than make up for it.
5,Red Roses For Me,A great CD with lots of good drinking music. It has some of the best Pogues songs on it. A must for any collection
3,Decent Compilation,"Where the hell is ""The Wanton Song""? I mean, this is one of their hardest rocking songs, off of Physical Graffiti. I also think ""Houses of the Holy"" should have been taken off, and instead, they should have had ""In My Time of Dying"". Track listings:1. The Song Remains the Same-8/102. No Quarter-7/103. Houses of the Holy-6/104. Trampled Underfoot-10/105. Kashmir-10/106. Ten Years Gone-4/107. Achilles Last Stand-9/108. Nobody's Fault But Mine-7/109. All My Love-8/1010. In the Evening-9/10"
4,"good,but the same sound",vol.2 is a good album but is same than 1973-1979.But is good for a new zeppelin-man
3,"Defintely not the ""Greatest""",I'm not gonna moan and complain like most do. But where is dancing days or over the hills...! Come on! They could've at least tried.
2,Physical Graffiti repackeged,"Save your money on this one and just step up and buy Physical Graffiti, you won't regret it."
5,"Great CD, ""Die Hard"" Fans should close their mouths","This CD is great, but I keep hearing all these ""Big Time, Mega Zeppelin Fans"" complaining that the CD doesn't have the right songs or is missing some. ATLANTIC RECORDS DOESN'T CATER TO YOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. It is just your opinions that No Quarter or Trampled Underfoot should be removed, I personally think all the songs are great. And also, Atlantic can't fit to many songs on the CD because you wouldn't buy the other albums. If you ""Die Hard"" fans want the perfect ""LATTER DAYS"", go out and buy a CD Burner. Just don't write about it here."
5,A very Beautiful CD,"This is Andy Statman's new CD that presents Instrumental interpretations of Niggunim of the Habad Hasidic movement. Andy uses either a trio or quartet here. On a majority of the material plays clarinet and a few of the latter cuts he plays mandolin. There is a very powefull emotion in Andy's clairinet playing and of course he is technically excellent. This CD has the same power as his last two CDs. I wish he would have stretched out more on some of the material as he is an exellent inproviser. Most importantly, I am very grateful that Andy has contributed his immense talent and creativity to the world of Jewish music. This is very spiritual moving music. Get this CD and be inspired."
2,A mixed bag,"This CD contains only 10 songs - presumably what was on the original vinyl.The song selection is a mixed bag. I bought it to check out its suitability for my grandchildren. My own selection of songs would be rather different. Old MacDonald really sells Elvis short, as do some of the other silly songs from his movies. The exceptions are ""Teddy Bear"", ""Wooden Heart"" and ""Puppet On A String"".Don't underestimate children. They like music with a beat and they love dancing to Elvis music. My grandchildren like ""Burning Love"" and ""Steamroller Blues"".The CD has apparently been discontinued by the manufacturers. Used CDs are available for purchase fairly cheaply, but all the songs are available on other CDs."
4,all the who,"The one good thing about this DVD is that all members are present. The sound quailty is good, but the camra work is of poor quality. All in all it has a good selection of songs,tempoand raw energy. For Who fans it is a must, as the latest Who material has a great big void, no John, as he was the driving force of the band and he will be missed along with Keith."
3,I Still Don't Get It,"The Who are an acquired taste, which I haven't yet acquired. Keith Moon was an original, but he was a basher who seldom left any space. The real revelation here is the bass playing of John Entwistle. Quite good. Jaco Pastorious may have stolen something from him. Who songs all tend to sound the same to me. This energetic live recording, from 37 years ago now, does little to dispel my opinion. Still, it's an interesting artifact, and one can see why the band has its fans."
5,A Classic Must-Have CD,My 12 year old saw Sting perform live and commented that he had a pretty great voice for an old guy. Bought the CD version of the album to give her a glimpse into Sting's musical past and a sense of the band's influence on modern artists. If you only have one Police CD this should be it.
3,When Your Ideas Are Running Down.....,"The Police were a little short on fresh ideas on this one it seems. While there are enough quality cuts (""Dont Stand So Close To Me, Driven To Tears, When The World Is Running Down, and Canary In A Coalmine"") There are plenty of sub par (""De Doo Doo Doo, De Da Da Da, Bombs Away, Man In A Suitcase"") and woeful (""The Other Way of Stopping and Behind My Camel""). A mixed bag on this one"
3,Not Bad For The Money,"Good CD's. They represent the era well. However, some of the music seems to be a bit obscure. Overall, if you're looking to add to your collection, it's worth the money."
3,This series is OK,"""The Prisoner"" series I bought with Patrick McGoohan is just O.K. I loved the plots but the graphics and ""reality"" of it was just O.K. compared to today's series, starring James Cavaziel (I think that's how you spell his name), which kept me interested and looking forward to the next episodes."
4,Great--except bonus features disc,"I am a 40+ year Prisoner fan and have watched the complete series many times over. This blu ray version is worth purchasing even if you have the earlier DVD edition. However, the disc with bonus features will not play on my Panasonic blu ray player. I get the menu but cannot select any of the options. Do a Google search and you'll discover that this is a well known problem. It's an excellent transfer that substantially improves the viewing experience, but be aware that the bonus disc does not play on many blu ray players."
4,Same transfers as the UK Network title!,"I was so pleased to find these are the same transfers as the UK Network set. I actually purchased that set last month and was disappointed to find it was locked for region B players only.I HIGHLY recommend this set. I've watched the 17 episodes of the Prisoner numerous times and even owned it first on the MPL laserdiscs and then the prior A&E; DVD set.The blu ray version blows any prior release out of the water! Colors are marvelously saturated, and the picture quality so good, I noticed details that I had previously overlooked. The picture is so good, it almost looked 3-D at times.I am so pleased with this set, and even the bonus features are marvelous. My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is the packaging. It is rather bland and I would have prefered something more along the lines of the UK Network set (nice box, great book, pictures etc.)If you are even a minor fan of the Prisoner or vintage television, this is a MUST buy!"
2,Disappointed,I am sorely disappointed in this product. I have been a fan of the Prisoner since the beginning but this product did not endear me to its creator.The video is marginal and the sound simply horrible. I spent the entire tiem fo the first 2 episodes with the volume control in hand trying to hear.The video is obviously drawn from the original 30 year old film with out correction or adjustment.It is simply a poor product.
3,This set is NOT newly remastered or restored!,"Yes, this series is wonderful and the DVD set is enjoyable, but be forewarned that this is not the newly restored/remastered edition that was released in the UK by Network last year. This is the same set that was released by A&E back in 2001 but with new packaging. I have not yet seen the new set, but apparently, the difference in quality is like day and night!"
3,Do not watch the ending,"The Prisoner is quite cheesy with its special effects in today's time but the psychological aspect is interesting. Each episode the viewer is introduced to a new number two with a brand new method of extracting information from number six. Of course number six always managed to survive the ordeal. As you watch this very good quality dvd transfer, you will get more interested until you watch the ending. Don't watch the last episode on volume10 because it is disappointing. This could be a 5 star dvd collection but a bad ending ruined it. Get it anyway and stay away from the ending."
1,"Beware, missing map!",Had to return it due to missing map of town. The replacement however was complete.
3,Rolls Royce,"Rolls Royce was good, but not as outstanding as I remebered them back in the day. I still like a few cuts on this concert a lot, Wishing on a Star for instance."
4,Good for basic information,"I use this cookbook for its clear, useful information about techniques, timing, and ingredients of slow cooking. It's a good investment for that function. But for the most part, the recipes are useless for me. Most of them involve multi-step stovetop cooking in addition to the slow cooker. I don't use a slow cooker to add cooking steps or prep time to my cooking. To each their own; if you have the time and interest to do so, you'll probably use the recipes. Even if you don't, you can easily create your own recipes by using the information about slow cooker equipment and techniques."
1,Don't waste your money,"The thing that I love about slow cookers is, you throw everything into the pot, turn it on and at dinner time you have a meal. It's simple, easy and tastes GREAT. Unless you like to cook, then put it into the crockpot, i would not recomend this book. You might as well cook the whole meal, you are already doing half of the cooking anyhow. Also.....the recipes in here have a LOT of ingredients, not very practicle for my family. We can't afford to cook gourmet meals."
4,If it weren't for this book I wouldn't be slow cooking,"This is the best vegetarian slow cooker cookbook that I've found, though there really aren't many others. I own two vegetarian slow cooker cookbooks and this is the only one I use. In the year that I've owned this book I've made close to 30 of the recipes. The photos in the book are enticing and the recipes are easy to follow and for the most part have been flavorful and popular with my family. I especially like the spicy recipes like Caribbean Pepper Pot Soup and Red Lentil and Carrot Soup with Coconut. There have been a few duds- Cannelloni with Tomato Eggplant Sauce didn't turn out well from my slow cooker. I have come to really embrace the technique of precooking the vegetables as suggested by Finlayson since this lends much better flavor and texture to the finished dishes. I am back today to purchase a copy for my sister, also a vegetarian and soon to be a regular slow cooker."
2,Music Good but Missing Action Cues from Movie,I bought this specifically for the action cue which plays in the movie when the doctor/police convoy drive over the bridge into the town (Seedercreek) for the first time. Sadly that along with a great deal other action cues are nowhere to be found on this album. However the music that is present is fantastic. But leaves much to be desired from the film.
1,Highly inaccurate,"As some of the mistakes in this book have been listed, I will just deal with the Hollywood stuff, which is TOTALLY INCORRECT:- Errol Flynn was NOT an accomplished swordsman- Tyrone Power was an EXPERT swordsman who NEVER - read this - NEVER used a double. Basil Rathbone, also an expert swordsman, said ""Tyrone Power could fence Errol Flynn into a cocked hat."" Rathbone and Power's swordfight in ""The Mark of Zorro"" is considered the best ever filmed.I have no idea where Mr. Cohen got his information, but I can personally attest that it is completely inaccurate and an insult to Power to boot, whose expertise was well known."
2,Glorifies Bullying,"At first glance, this bumpersticker is a humorous rejoinder to all those ""My child is an honor student"" bumperstickers. The second star is for the humor, sick though it is.BUT this sticker also glorifies bullying. Bullying is a serious, non-laughing matter in schools all over the U.S. Had bullying been taken seriously, the Columbine massacre and others likely would have never happened. Also, if you have a child and buy this sticker, think of the message this message send to him (or her): that he's not that bright and that bullying has tacit parental approval. Don't we have enough violence in our culture without have to minimize it and laugh about it with this sticker?Also, in many schools, academic success and intelligence are not particularly valued. This further sends the message that academic success and intelligence are not valued by the society at large."
2,so-so,"I guess the biggest problem is that if you are used to the quality of the ipod, products like this GE accessory are destined to feel cheap and shoddy. My real disappointment was with the FM transmitter. I can't even count on having a signal the whole way on my 6 mile drive to work and back. When it's there it's so-so, static-y most of the time with small periods of clean sound. I mostly listen to audio books and it's very distracting. The stereo hook up works but you have to have the sound on the ipod all the way up and turn your stereo all the way up (way past any level I use in any other listeneing scenario) but the sound here is fine. The headphones seem good even if they feel cheap. That's as far as I have gotten with the set. It's okay for a test drive of the range of options, for example I'll keep saving up for an ipod-ready stereo instead of trying to get a better fm transmitter."
5,great recipe book.,"this is a great book for the persons that have to take Coumadin, i bought my copy in April 2008 and am still use it. it has some very good recipes in it, and the author did an excellent job researching and compiling this book for Coumadin users. I highly recommend it."
4,"Great light, hard to use pump style part of it and no way to change battery","The light is really bright and nice, but this thing about using either the built in battery or by charging by shaking does not play out well in the real world. First, it takes A LOT of shaking to get a little light. Second, the ""double click"" way of switching between manual shaking mode and built in battery mode is very confusing and hard to do. Most of the time you don't know if you are using the built-in battery or the charge you just made by shaking. Most of the time I just go with the builtin because of all the hassles I talked about above. Also, if the internal battery runs out, you are stuck with something that only works by shaking as there is no way to change the battery. Kind of stupid I think since the built in power was one big reason I bought the thing."
2,Use it and dump it!,"We bought this last winter but used it very rarely.This winter it broke down only after a month of regular usage.Very affordable and light weight.I loved it until it lasted, although I never got the heat setting right so I always left it on low.Waste of money.Had to buy a different heater this year."
4,the new Jase,"I own all of his albums, and I have to say, it's the best one. Especially while he wrote the songs himself and while it's a whole other kind of music than we are used to hear from him. I really hope he'll make a new album very soon."
1,WHAT A RIP-OFF!,"I bought this book thinking it was a follow-up to Poison Heart, which I enjoyed very much, but IT IS EXACTLY (WORD FOR WORD) THE SAME BOOK with a different cover and publishing date! Even Amazon makes it look like 2 different books.However, if you haven't read Poison Heart, then I strongly recommend you read this book for an insight to the major creative force behind one of the world's greatest bands since the Beatles.I did find the language unnecessarily vulgar at times. Does f--k even have to be on the outside jacket reviews. I think Dee Dee should stop trying to appeal to morons and realize that his audience has a brain; maybe the Ramones would have been bigger if they didn't try so hard to look stupid.I will keep the book because I am a collector and a fan, but I warn all buyers to BEWARE!"
1,Not Recommended,Bought one of these at Costco. Worked fine for a few weeks. Then it started giving erratic readings - up or down a few pounds.Too late to return it. It will soon be land fill.Absolutely not recommended.
1,3 months and failed,"This is a very accurate scale but it completely failed at 3 months. It's just another of dozens of broken Chinese made products in my home, but what else can you buy?"
3,Not as good a THINNER,"I bought this scale to replace my THINNER scale I had for 15 years. It had a 10yr warranty, and went 15yrs on the irreplaceable battery. I chose the Taylor scale because it had a similar style, and a bigger and illuminated readout. If the readout were accurate, I would be pleased. Sometimes I get on and it shows 9lbs lower than before. I wiggle it around and get back on and it's back to where it was previously.One other issue I have is that my THINNER had big round buttons/feet on the corners. I had to tap the front corners to activate it. The Taylor does not have the round corners to tap first, but it does have rather sharp pointy edges on which I had jammed my pinky toe a couple of times. Ouch."
3,Disapointed,"Such a beautiful appliance. Accuracy is my only complaint.Compared to scales in various physicians offices, I estimate it reads about 3# light and apparently there is no way to reset or re-zero."
1,Disappointed,"Scale has a great design and display. I put scale on a flat surface and set according the the instructions. However, I was disappointed in the fact that (1) the mechanism was defective (never gave the same weight twice), (2) batteries (included) were old and calcified, (3) outside and inside packaging looked as though the product was repackaged and returned before. I had no other choice but to send the item back. I've used Amazon for many years and this is the first time I was really disappointed in one of their products.Louise - NYC"
4,The 9 clon?,"I liked that book a lot, although the lack of an organized introduction leaves you confused for a while, the great part comes when you see the two stories link together, another amazing thing is how Craven gets to keep you thrilled during the whole book, although the ending of the books lets a little more to wish......The only thing i didnt like about the book is the translation to the spanish,it is very stiff..the title of the book is The 9 clon!!! can u believe that."
3,Average,"I enjoy series mysteries and I don't hold them to a high standard as far as writing, but I do get frustrated when the characters act in a way that you just can't suspend disbelief enough to accept. The author of this series can't seem to decide if her character is a strong, smart woman or a ditz. The ditz part seems like the author thought she needed a gimmick (the malapropisms or whatever that word problem the main character has is). I'd like the book better without it because then I wouldn't feel like smacking the main character."
4,Enjoyable,"I liked this mystery a lot. I think Lee is a great character. I don't find her speech impediment annoying at all like others have said. The mystery was fast paced and enjoyable. You will definitely be craving chocolate when you read it. I really appreciate that the book wasn't bogged down by endless descriptions of chocolate and chocolate-making. Its definitely a themed mystery but doesn't go overboard like the coffee mysteries by Cleo Coyle.I only had two problems with the book: 1) the ending was suspenseful but the killer was too obvious - I would have liked it to have been someone else; and 2) there was one small thread left hanging that prevented it from having a neat and tidy tie-up.But overall, I would definitely recommend this book!"
4,Read this with plenty of chocolate on hand...,"or the reader may find themselves running to 7-11 in the middle of the night for some. The Chocolate Cat Caper is all that a cozy mystery should be: Well plotted, enjoyable real-life-like characters, some devilishly tempting chocolate talk included and of course a who-done-it mystery. When cut-throat attorney Clemintine ""the Ripper"" Ripley is poisoned by chocolates from TenHuit Chocolade's it is up to newly arrived Lee McKinney to clear hers and herself Aunt Nettie (owner of TenHuit) of the crime. It doesn't help that Lee has a habit of saying the wrong word at the exact wrong time (thus causing some truly laugh out loud moments). But a second murder then makes it seem even more likely poor Lee, who just wants to get on with her life after a divorce and study for the CPA exam, will be able to do anything except that. I am planning to buy the next in the series and hope there are many more to follow."
4,Peanuts Chess Game,Peanuts Chess Game is a great way to introduce chess to your little ones.This toy is great for adults as well. The characters are colorful and make chess an interesting & fun way to play and learn.
4,Charming!,"This made-for-Tv movie is based on the myths of St. Nicholas and the Netherland's Zwarte Piet, or Black Pete. It does a charming job of explaining many of the origins of the myths associated with Santa Claus, how he came to use reindeer, how he aquired his traditional outfit, how stockings came to be used and many others.This is a charming, multi-cultural tale that leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy."
4,New blood for Mr.Big...,"With the addition of Ritchie Kotzen,Mr Big can finally afford a slight change in direction,getting a little bluesier,and even funky,while all the goodies they used to deliver are still there...bigger than ever.This is probably their most mature album to date."
5,Simply Brilliant,"Not many people know the Incredible String Band these days. But my Title says it all.If you're into acoustic eclecticism, this will work for you, I'm sure.Others have waxed eloquent enough. I'll just say it's one of my favourite, right up there with ""U""."
3,Cool idea... not so cool toy,"My 4 year old recieved this for christmas, he's a big Bat-Man fan. The car is very cool, but we have not been able to find a Robin ANYWHERE, I've looked and looked, and he was disappointed not to have a Robin to put in the removable motorcycle. So he has 2 batmans play in the car. The pieces fall off a lot, and the figures do not fit very well. The lids to the seats snap onto the car and after 1 day the clips are about to break off. This is not a durable toy, although it looks pretty cool."
3,Piece of Junk,My son received this for his 4th birthday. When we tried to put it together right out of the box it already started to fall apart. We ended up taking off all of the parts you are supposed to put on and only had the motorcycle which detaches from the car. My son plays with the motorcycle more than the car. I paid $25 for this and it wasn't worth the plastic it was molded with. My son stopped playing with it after two weeks because it was so junky and he would cry when it would fall apart.
2,Save your money and prevent disappointing your child!,"My husband purchased this toy online for our son. He was overseas so I was the one who had the task of putting it together. First of all, it was very hard to assemble. The pieces had to snap into one another which seems easy but is not. I finally took it to my neighbor who is fairly strong and he also had a hard time, but finally succeeded. Not only was it hard to put together but you had to be careful while assembling it so that you would not loose an eye. The ends are very pointed. As hard as it is to put together it is equally hard to keep together. I am continuously reassembling it, even though each time gets a little easier, it gets more annoying. My son gets frustrated every time it falls apart. I have never in my life had such an awful toy. Today I assembled the toy for the last time and hung it on the wall. Again, due to the ends being so pointed I hung it fairly high on a wall. In conclusion, SAVE YOUR MONEY."
5,"Replacement Lawn Mower Wheel for MTD # 734-1860 , 734-1871",This product is ok. It was easy to replace the broken wheel and seems to be holding up ok. The price is good so I got several just in case the original on the other side breaks. I live in the land of rocks and difficult mowing conditions. I think that this wheel will hold up just fine.
4,Is what is was pictured,"This is the correct wheel I needed to replace the one that was partially crushed during Hurricane Irene by a tree that fell on our storage shed. However, not sure there is as much material and engineering here to justify the cost. Luckily, all I needed was one of these to be back in business otherwise $40 worth of wheels...I was only $60 a way from a new mower."
5,Excellent Book,This book has been excellently written and contains a ton of information for couples facing fertility problems. It's very well designed with an easy layout and one of the best fertility books on the market. I came across it a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of information Marina has put into the book. Definitely worth a read.
1,stay away,if i wanted to see a drunk bum i would go behind the abc . no i wanted to learn a little more on the process of makeing it and about its roots . keep this in mind if you dont wanna feel cheated to
5,very happy with it,goes into detail about everything you will need to know to build a big-inch smallblock. Priceless tables and parts selection comparisons down to the actual part number are included. The big-inch theory is well explained. The book is also well written and fun to read. A great book
3,Not enough details,"I bought this after purchasing an eagle 383 stroker kit, I wanted a description of the correct way to clearance the block. It was not there..How much is needed, How to do it, What tools are recommend... nothing. so for me the book was kind of a waste of money"
4,Read it for the 13 cases,"This book is good only for the 13 cases the author profiles. Each case is given its own separate chapter. The author does an excellent job in describing childhoods, important relationships and events that lead these women to kill. She also details these womens crimes. Keep in mind this is not for the faint at heart. She doesn't go into heavy graphic details of the crimes like other authors, but none the less what is written is still disturbing. The last three chapters of the book cover things like classifying female serial killers and why women kill. I was disappointed with the last three chapters. I felt the author could of done a better job. She references other books on these subjects which might be worth checking out."
2,Leaked,Installed this valve.....leaked like there was no tomorrow. Ended up @ Home Depot....bout one which was a heck of a lot cheaper and did not leak.
1,I feel misled...,"I bought this product because it came up on the list when I searched for Fuze armbands. I have no idea what the E200 is, and have never heard of it. I thought E200 was the series of holster, not a Sansa product! I feel misled. Something about this page is making it show up in Fuze search results. The return policies are draconian (must pay own return shipping after going through onerous process to return, and 15% restocking fee). For an $8 product it isn't worth it to return it. I might as well throw it in the trash. What a waste."
3,Is this armband ok for the Sansa Fuze?,"I'm not sure, please let me know if it fits or which ones are ok for the Fuze. Thanks"
3,belkin sansa e200 series holster,good basic design. difficult to use the e200 controls while in holster. the arm band is starting to fray and it is only one month old! the case is good and can also be used on your belt but it does not lock on and can fall off.
3,"Unless you are selling your geneology services, not recommended","I got this book for my dad who is really into geneology. He does small seminars at the Public Library and such. I thought for his birthday I would get him a geneology book so he could learn a little more. The reviews for this book said that is was for professional geneologists and teachers or die-hard people who are interested in it. So I thought he fit the category. He told me that is focused more on how to charge for your services than anything, more legal garb than insider professional hints to geneology. So we are returning the book."
3,All Over The Map In a Good Way,"This is a stylistically diverse album, with different sounds, lyrical themes, and singers. The only constant is Mike Watt on bass and his songwriting sensabilities. It's a great album, though not all songs are equal, but many are excellent."
5,Earnest yet playful,"The first time I listened to this I thought it was more of the somewhat disappointing eponymous third Television album which I found a little too subdued. With the chops that Mr. Verlaine has, you can't help hoping he'll let out the rock'n'roll hounds every so often. However, the more I listened to it the more it got under my skin, with its lyricism, combination of earnestness and playfulness, and subtle yet killer guitar licks. It's still on heavy rotation on my i-pod shuffle and I keep enjoying it more and more with every listen. In other words, buy it, give it a chance, and see the glory."
3,Hit and Miss,"If you just played me the opening instrumental, and didn't tell me who it was, I would say, ""Who's the schlocky smooth jazz band?"" Tracks 2-4 just kinda sit there, wanting to be something but not sure what that something is. Tracks 5 and 6 are the album savers and are the two things that kept me from just sticking this right in my to-sell stack. From 7-14 there is nothing outstanding but nothing as bad as the opener. The overall feel is just what you'd expect from Tom Verlaine: spidery, understated art pop songs with spindly guitar, intelligent lyrics, and Verlaine's cool talking vocal style. This is a good album but what I keep thinking as I listen is he needs the rest of Television to go from okay to outstanding."
5,Joan B. is fabulous!,"This CD teaches you many different ways to meditate and that one way is not good for everyone. After each instruction, Joan leads us in that particular meditation. She uses love, humor and knowledge to teach meditations that cross the lines of religion. There is something here for everyone."
1,Her voice is annoying!,"I was expecting something better after reading the positive reviews. I found the tone of her voice phony to the point of being comical, like she was speaking to a small child. Needless to say, I couldn't get past it, making it impossible to relax (although I did giggle a few times)."
1,BAD MOVIE,"I had been trying to find a copy of this movie for a long time, when finally I spotted a used copy at my favorite used video store. Let's just say I was extremely disappointed. Bad acting, bad plot, bad directing... even the quality of my tape was bad. The movie's only redeeming quality is seeing a young and beautiful Uma Thurman in her first role."
1,Slow to Start - Difficult to Finish,"I thought this book was about a hitchhiking experience, but was suprised to find the author taking buses or riding with his photographer from New York City into PA, then from Ohio well into Wyoming. I found his writing style to be rambling and uninteresting, and was unable to keep reading after 100 pages or so. Had he truly hitchhiked, and kept to stories about hitchhiking, he probably would have written a great book."
5,Sounds like it sounds right this time..,"My rating's going by what I've read.Going by the reviuews here, they FINALLY got the right music (something I read something akin to back then)..sad the new deluxe sixe Rhino set has that bad resoundtracking.I have the older FAMILY HOME ENTERTAINMENT 1980s compilations (with original music/SFX/voices).The use of the Capitol/Seely Associates music, not neccarily ""original"" but soudning so, and the Sound FX (a huge part of the original, retained here), are in some cases heard in some other studios..The soundtrack is wonderful on the 1950s-60s..I hope to get this DVD.."
1,this is the one where Jos. A. Bank lose me as a customer. Forever,"What a load of losers Jos. A. Bank are. Treat your customers poorly. They are stupid . They'll forget.Sorry losers. We wanted to be your customers, but you screwed us. Let us show you what long memories we have. One by one by one by one."
5,"the BEST after-finals, brain-death movie!","The first time I saw this movie (waaaaay back when), I wasn't sure I liked it much. Then I saw it again right after finals... LOVE! This movie doesn't have a lot in story, but that's what makes it wonderful - You can turn off the brain for a moment & just enjoy. I've always liked Geena Davis better than Julie Brown, but can never stop singing those songs: ""The perfect man for me? Superman with a lobotomy!"" Still ROFL after all these years!"
4,COOL!,"this movie is cool! it has jim carey an damon wanyes, u cant go wrong! wacthing them together is funny. the only reason i gave this movie 4 stars is cuz it has to much singing in it. but other then that this movie ROCKED!! I MISS IN LIVING COLOR! WHEN ARE THEY GONNA BRING OUT VIDEOS OF THAT SHOW??! WE WENT IN LIVING COLOR!!"
1,Defective disc!!,Defective DVD! It was labeled as being the movie but the disc had NO video data on it. I tried it in two different dvd players. I had seen this problem once before and the retailer ended up pulling the movie from his selves after verifying the lot was defective
5,loved it,totally what i expected arrived before the date that was given.. would recommend to anyone.. this was a video my family watched when we were kids..
5,Consuming Grief: Compassionate cannibalism in an amazonian society,este articulo tuvo las tres b's bueno bonito barato este articulo tuvo las tres b's bueno bonito barato este articulo tuvo las tres b's bueno bonito barato
1,DO NOT BUY,"What a waste of 35.00. The video was shot sometime around 1985. Its a bunch of good ol boys out fishing, with one trying to push his custon made lures. Its like watching a cable access show, shot in 1985. Do not waste your money. I learned nothing."
2,Another sequel gone awry,"This watched more like an episode of the tv series ""Goof Troop"" than a real movie. Same underdeveloped plot, same predictable slapstick, and what the heck happened to Bobby? He used to be the coolest cat around, but now? Shame on you Disney. Shame."
5,A Timeless CD!,"Unlike most albums released in the mid 80's, this one is not dated. It it the perfect anytime album. The soft soothing music is a perfect fit for Chris Rea and his unique vocal presentation. It is also the best of all the Chris Rea albums. (so far) The song ""Giverny"" is a great catchy song, but my favorite is still ""Just passing through"". Simply lovely! I bought this CD for my dad for father's day a few years back and it remains one of his favorite albums in recent times. I have searched Chris Rea's entire catalog for another gem like this one. All of his albums contain a few gems (sans Tennis; what was he thinking?) But this CD is loaded with great songs."
5,Beary Awesome,"This movie is really worth watching. It has the movie,Sportcentury of Bear Bryant and interviews of the real people who were there. The movie is somewhat embellished abnd brings back memories of football camp. They believed you don't give players water also. Just remember it is camp and camp never is supposed to be fun. Camp is grulling. Truly the Bear is the best. Six national titles and only one losing season. The only ring he wore was the Junction Boys ring. He truly had such great respect for these guys. A sports film worth owning. Don't forget to buy Monday Night Mayhem."
2,Kind of a disapointment.......,"I was very excited to see that Vengaboys had a new cd out, since I liked The Party Album so much, I ordered The Platnum Album. I was pretty disapointed with this release, there were only 2 songs that I liked."
3,Really not much here,"I do not like to put down other people's hard work, but there really is not much going on with this dance album. I really like the catchy ""Shalalalala"" and the pretty ballad ""Forever As One,"" but that is it. All of the other songs sound like generic dance songs."
3,Eh..............,"The Vengaboys were THE dance act of 1999. Their new release hasn't come out in the USA yet, and I was tired of waiting for it to come out and downloading the songs so I bought the import. I was kinda disappointed with it. There are good songs on there (Kiss, Shalala, etc.) but I had already heard those. The other tracks I hadn't heard are not as good. One song called ""48 Hours"" is the SAME song as ""Everything Begins with an E"" from Alice Deejay. (It's the same people producing, mind you, but still...) And there's even a power ballad!! Imagine the Vengaboys singing a love song!! Anyway, the CD is redeemed for the ""Bonus"" video footage that you have to use your computer to see."
3,Weak...,"Sorry, but this CD just kind of showcases a band that took itself too seriously and tried to ""change sounds"" and members, thinking no one would notice that latter of those, but failing miserabley in both.This CD isn't horrible, but it's definitely a mediocre, silly, annoying, throwaway. the only truly good song on it is ""Kiss Kiss Kiss (When The Sun Don't Shine)"", which after a while, becomes rather inane...Their first album is a classic for its showcasing of the wicked-coolness of hardcore, impersonal dance-grooves...but they tried to become pop-stars here, so forget it...Who ever was really interested in ""them"" anyway?:>(sorry if i offended anyone;0-)"
2,"Aims to shatter convention, but fails to even crack it.","Gaines has written a book that starts out promising but ends up being about as deep as Jane's slave name, ""Ticey."" He does nothing to transcend the hackneyed images of former slaves. It's almost as if, for all his groundbreaking intentions, he's afraid to change public perception too much. He seems to feel that, if he challenges common doctrine to the point where people will have to reconsider their convictions, then he will be overstepping his bounds. But isn't that the point of nonconformist novels such as The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman? To contest that which is accepted, no matter the cost or means of getting there? Instead Gaines pretends to be an iconoclast with this novel, and, in doing so, leaves his characters as mere caricatures, their motives and accomplishments just meaningless accessories to their sketchiness."
3,This Book Is An Definite,"I felt that this book really tells how it was for women in the late 1800's to earliy 1900's. This autobiography was well worth reading. At times I felt like I knew what was really happening. Reading this book made me appriciate how well I am respected by men. I gave it three stars because it was kind of hard to get through. Some of the chapters had thick dialog. Meaning it was hard to understand the way they talked. It's so different from the way we talk now. But on the other hand it was really informative. Reading this book (like I said before) really made me feel like I was there washing the dishes, or out in the hot sun pulling weeds."
3,The book was Okay...,"I think this book showed a lot on the ways of a woman growing up after the times of slavery. I think it was a good example for and 7th grader to 10th grader learning about slavery. It was an okay book hat got a little to discriptive, and I kind of lot intrest at the end, becuse I started to get the idea of what would happen next. It also was a little to hard to follow, by the end. The got a little tedeous by the end also and since I felt like I knew what was going to happen next. Altough this book had it's upsides. It showed a good example of what happened during this time."
2,The was one of the worst books i have ever read!,"This book was terrible! One minute someone is teaching about equal rights, and the next minute he is dead! The book doesn't go into any detail about anything important. All the stories are also totally irrelivent to eachother! This book was terrible so i suggest that you don't read it!"
5,Must have,"This is very short review :)Everyone, who played Carcasson - must have this expansion.Make it fun!"
4,"A fun and exciting addition, but not for the faint of heart!","We tried out our new Tower Expansion and were pleasantly surprised at how simple the rules were! It added a whole new dimension to the game though, and you really need to brace yourself to have all your potential points taken away if your follower is taken prisoner off of a big city or farming area. It made the game much more intense though, and it really causes you to change your strategy to keep the towers in mind. We also like playing with the tower tiles just as an addition to the regular game, without actually building towers or using the new rules. The tile-holder that came with it was also useful and better quality than we expected. And it still leaves plenty of room to grow with future expansions!"
3,CHRISTMAS AND BIRTHDAY,Its A Good DVD But The Episode That Starts Gumby Sleeping ItsNot Called Gumbasia Like Its Says On The Episode List ItsCalled TOY JOY Which Gumbo And Gumba Let GUmby Choose A BIRTHDAYPressent They Cut Out Gumba Saying Happy Birthday Gumby.And TheEpisode A Cristmas Carol Is Called Scrooge Loose The Pigeon AndA Plumb Tree is The Real Title But The Unusial Story's Is CalledSanta Witch GT Messed Up Badly On This One But i Should Not GetSo Mad After All This Was My First Gumby DVD And It Did Make Me Hooked On Gumby And Pokey
2,Masquerading as Angels,"A good book, but not one of my favorites. I read a lot of these kinds of books and this one is just so/so."
2,probably deserves many awards,"This was the most depressing movie I have ever seen in my whole life (and I am seventy years old). My family and I racked our brains to think of a movie that was more of a downer and we came up with a few other nominations but ""House of Sand and Fog"" won hands down. The acting was superb but I wouldn't reccommend the movie to anyone. Mary Frances Brawner Seguin, Texas"
2,A different interpretation.,"Jeez, don't mean to break up the love fest over the 'victims' in the movie. I thought that the characters were well drawn and Ben was in top form. But, I could not sympathize with the girl. Hasn't she ever heard of consequences? The only thing I could see in the film was a self-absorbed girl in an unfortunate, but avoidable, circumstance being aided by a cop who should never have passed his oral boards, let alone a psych exam. Together they dismantle a strong and faithful family while being blissfully unaware of their consequences.If a movie's purpose is to evoke strong emotion, this movie does it, but for all the wrong reasons. It seems to be another case of western 'civilization' clashing with 'other' beliefs. Hopefully such 'Amero-centric' thinking will finally meet its extinction when folks realize that there are no good guys vs. bad guys. We are all interconnected and bound to the same earth by the same emotions and dreams. Step away from the mirror America."
2,So disappointing!,"I was eager to see this movie, as I greatly respect the acting talent of Ben Kingsley and thought Jennifer Connelly did a wonderful job in ""A Beautiful Mind""; however, I hated this movie. The characters were frustratingly stupid, making terrible decisions that ultimately lead to horrific tragedies. I gave it 2 stars because that acting was, despite the story line, very good."
3,"Bleak, but well-acted","I agree with parts of both positive and negative reviews of this film, which are posted here. The positive reviews seem to focus on the characters' acting abilities, and the negative seem to focus on the bleakness of the film. It's true that this film is bleak. Morose, even. If you enjoy morosely bleak things that are assembled with high-quality, then you will probably enjoy this film. While I appreciate the abilities of the actors and the lessons the movie taught about the dangers of preconceived notions, I did not enjoy this film. I don't think it's a film that's meant to be enjoyed. It bore a lot of resemblance to another highly acclaimed film ""In the Bedroom"" where the characters' lives are slowly picked apart and brought to ruin. I see few redeeming qualities in movies like this because, although they very much resemble what can, and often does happen in real life, who wants to focus on such caustic aspects of existence?"
1,Dumbest movie I've seen in ages,"A stupid, self-absorbed woman loses her house and sets off a series of events that end in tragedy. The premise of the movie is sound, and with a better screen play, it could have been great.I absolutely hated Jennifer Connelly's ""acting"" in this movie. I have no desire to see her again. In addition, the story had so many flaws that strained credibility, my husband and I were laughing at it by the end of the movie.I'm surprised Ben Kingsley would waste his time on such a turkey. Glad I didn't spend more to see it."
2,Why not follow the book?,"The actors were excellent. The book is great but this movie missed the whole concept of the book. With the right screenplay, this could have been a very good film. The movie totally missed the mark--"
5,Fifth Gear for your Soul,"This movie, nearly three days after watching the DVD, still has me in an emotional tornado, stirring with feelings of compassion, disgust, sympathy, guilt, pride ... the list goes on and on. One of the most stunning films I've ever seen, ""House"" lures the viewer into a seemingly simple melodramatic portrayal of addiction and weakness, pride and strong will, yet unravels into something so creatively, yet so believably dramatic and powerful.The acting is masterful, the score subtly brilliant, the cinematography, casting, and writing are of nothing but greatness. To watch this movie and not feel so connected, yet so alone is almost inhuman. Of course you will recognize great filmmaking has been crafted, but you also find yourself so powerfully driven to cherish and challenge you own virtues and that of others. If like me, you will feel wrecked, days later even, by the raw emotional toll this film has levied on your soul."
1,DVD-House of Sand and Fog,"I did not read the book, but this is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Having nothing to do with the actors' performances, the characters actions were completely unrealistic (mainly the officer's), and the ending was quite uselessly disturbing."
5,The Guide to Owning a Staffordshire Bull Terrier(Marion Lane,"Amongst the limited number of books available on this particular breed, most of which I own, this one stands out. Not only is it lavishly illustrated with superior quality photographs of Staffs, supplies, other recommended books and how-to-photos (say, clean the puppy's ears), but the contents is detailed enough, to the point, useful and informative. As I was reading the book what also came through was the Author's affection for this breed. Other books on the subject, either boring or too matter-of-factly, have fallen short of affording me such a bonus."
5,This movie is AWESOME!!,"I really dig movies of the 1970's my birth year, I would love to know if this movie is coming on DVD! They say that there was a R rated version of this film if anyone knows of this, let me know ASAP! These kids have the attitude of the world that I have today minus the drugs of course!! Anyway, a totally radical film!! It's why I say NEVER underestimate kids!!"
5,eolltz,"I havent seen this movie since it first came out on HBO. I was around 10 or 11 years old but I've never forgotten its relevance. To make it even more of an impact I grew up in Northport NY and was around 12 when Ricky Kasso killed Gary Lauwers which was depicted in the book ""Say you love Satan"". The book was 100% BS but ""Over the Edge"" would be so much more of an acurate dipiction of suburban youth and its fate in Northport. Over the Edge' forshadowed the real life tragedy in my town. Oddly, ""the River's Edge"" came out about a year after the incident and was a loose interpretation of the events in Northport. I havent seen it."
2,"Can you say ""Cheesy?""","I grew up in the suburbs not to long ago and can somewhat relate to the general message of this film. I do remember well the utter boredom that my friends and I would have to endure day after day which eventually led us to create our own adolecent problems: using/dealing drugs, vandalism, fights, etc. But the main problems with this film lie primarily with the writing and the atrocious acting. Because of this, this film, with its preachy and stupid message, comes off more as a silly, dated film than anything that we can learn from. Oh well, if nothing else, it was entertaining."
2,The OTHER Doug,"The VHS I bought was nice and cheap. Shipping was decent. It was true to the description that it was never opened and still wrapped, it even still had a sticker coupon on the front for like a dollar off Easy Mac or something that expired in 2001.The movie itself is not great. It REALLY IS nothing like the old Nickelodeon Doug we all love. It feels empty and the characters are different and there's really no heart.I still welcome it into my collection."
5,Barry At His Best,"For my money this is the best and bravest album Barry Manilow has ever done. Every song is outstanding, the orchestrations are lush and the performances as deep and varied as any he has ever produced. This is an album of all highlights and the closing track is a true killer. Barry came out with this one when his music career looked in trouble indeed--his quality work just couldn't compete with easy-to-digest junk which was gobbling up the charts. His response was to raise his own bar and dare the consumers to give it a try (the original issue carried that dare on the cover). I never stop listening to this album--it's what great pop is all about."
3,"Good, but not great","I ordered these wraps about a month ago, but it looks like I had them for about a year or more. The velcro straps from the wraps or the boxing gloves get caught with the material and completely shreds them. I wish the material was a little stronger or thicker. I am not a professional boxer so these will do,just need to be careful with them getting caught in the velcro."
3,Its not what I thought it was,"The item i believed this to be was the ones for the iPod earphones or and standard sized earphone, but this is more suited for headphones which i misunderstood in my haste to buy. Please read the packaging before buying as i did."
5,Worked perfectly.,"I got the Koss PortaPro headphones when they were new, I think it was 1998. They're a really nice set of phones, BTW. Not studio monitors, but I worked in a boring lab job, and needed quality sound. Those delivered.That is, until, about 8 or 9 years late when the foam started disintegrating. I saw rotten black poly in my kid's ears when he borrowed them.These pads fit perfectly. They have been in place for almost 4 years now, and they have not disintegrated.I'm speaking directly to performance and longevity, now:A single set of these pads has been in place for almost 4 years, and has not started to break down.Granted, I use these in climate-controlled conditions only... but they're lasting so long, I don't even know where the package is.And the sound quality has not deteriorated in the least since this replacement. If anything, they restored the balance that was lost when the old pads degraded.I have and will continue to recommend these to friends."
5,covers,"Good for Koss , they are still a great company even though some of their stuff is now China made , wish they would bring it back ot the USA . But they do back all their stuff for life so if any Koss headphone product ever breaks just go to their website and get a rma and they will replace it . They replaced a 20 year old pair of PRo4AA headphones without question , doesn't get any better than that ."
4,These fit my fold up Sennheiser PX 100's perfectly,These earpad cushions fit my fold up Sennheiser PX 100's perfectly. The foam texture does feel a touch rough but they're reasonably comfortable.
4,"Great, but a little pricey","These are as advertised, and make your Koss headphones just like new. They are easy to install on the Porta Pro headphones. My only issue is cost - at over 12 dollars for a 40 dollar headset can seem a little pricey, but they were needed and do the job well."
3,"Perfect earpads, but who has six ears?","I've been using my Koss PortaPros for about two years now, and I'm finally needing to replace my cushions. Last time I checked, I had two ears, but these pads only come in packages of six. Why is that the case? Two years from now, am I going to remember where I put them?Then again, headphones that have lasted two years, and are still going strong? It's a joy to need these replacements. But I don't like the wasteful packaging."
1,"Cheap, flimsy and very thin .","These cushions are worth a dollar at best. They are way too small for the Koss Portapros and look as if they are not a genuine Koss item. They are made in China. I purchased from Amazon instead of Ebay hoping for a quality product, Not! Save your money."
3,Fast delivery but the wrong size,The experience was good but the size was smaller that I expected. So I returned it.
2,looks good,This did not come with instructions - just a wood box in a cardboard shipping box. Needless to say I was a little disappointed.
5,Monheit excels again,"Admittingly, we are big Monheit fans and her latest album doesn't disappoint. We simply love most everything she does and she has become as consistently good as another of our favorites: Janis Siegel. The album was so good that I bought extra copies to give to friends."
5,My Favorite!,"I own a lot of CDs. but this one by Jane Monheit is my favorite. Turn on the water fountain, pour yourself a glass of good wine, settle back in a comfortable chair and be swept away by the magnificent voice and captivating style of a truly wonderful female vocalist. This is the CD I use to measure all the rest...LOP"
2,Better when I was younger,This movie was better when I was younger. When I watched it recently I just got bored. The pacing was bad and it seemed longer than it was. The sequel is slightly better.
2,Do you fear for your child?,"When asked by a friend if they should watch this film, I immediately replied ""No. It's really bad. The first 18 minutes are scary, and the last 18 minutes are scary. Everything in the middle is a trainwreck."" If you MUST see this film, take my word for it, after the first 18 minutes, fast forward to the last 18 minutes. What your left with is 40 minutes of great suspense. Carol Kane is about the only thing going for this turkey. The only other scary part is the three sizes too small mustard yellow polo shirt Charles Durning wears through the middle of the film."
2,Worst baseball game for PSX.,"I just got this game, and I only played it for about 15 min. The graphics are horrible, batting is hard cuz u have to put the little crosshair thingy on the ball. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is cuz it has a lot of stadiums including spring training in Arizona and Florida. If u want a good baseball game for PSX try Triple Play Baseball."
2,Studies of the Human Figure,"The book promised much, but it gave little. It was a rehash of old photos and diagrams from the 1930s. Half the book was technical jargon without accompaning illustrations for clarity. What few illustrations it had were old and too small to be of much benefit. They were also positioned too far from the text to make a connection between word and picture. A greater effort was made for the sake of modesty of models than thoughtful book design. Although, I found that the photo captions were relevent and helpful."
5,Indispensable.,For anyone that finds differential equations beautiful; for the theoretical scientist in whatever field; this is nearly as indispensable as Abromowitz and Stegun (The Big Ugly Blue Book).
5,Sound and Thorough,"This book is a sound and thorough text on the fundamentals and basic 50-package. Detailed explanations are available on linebacker reads, d-line reaction, and coverage schemes. I recommend it highly as a resource on coaching the 50 package."
5,A BIG Improvment from the other's!,"I think that this book has made a big come back from the last one's. The other book's were ok but they needed racing, the suspense of being on the track and just the plain old exitment! I have all of the Wonder's Legacy serie's and aside from Without Wonder this one is the best. i never thought I would see Christina become a jockey. Well all in all this book was awsome and I hope they stick to racing again."
4,OK,I thought this book was ok. I didn't like how Chris sold Sterling. I likes how she became a jockey. I hope she gets with Parker and gets married.
5,good set,2 for 1... good set. you can't go wrong with ernest. goes to camp and jail... 2 of the best ones he has... share them with the next generation...
1,Expensive and not worth the effort,"If you go on this week long starve your supplements alone are going to run you $100. Then you have to take 5 handfuls of pills every day. I think the author must have stock in the ""Twin Lab"" corporation because they are the only ones who carry some of the weirder things you have to take. Also, you have to go without food for 48 hours. Doesn't sound hard but if you have a family it is almost impossible. You also have to take cold/boiling showers and do something called ""dry skin brushing"". I tried it with an open mind and it did nothing for me. The friend who recommended the book tried it with the thought it was going to solve all her problems, and it helped a great deal. So why not skip the complicated starvation and stuff and just believe that you are going to be helped by something simple?"
2,Poor Quality Sound,The songs are nice and the artist is good but unfortunately they are not remastered(the songs)too bad that is not on the description album it should be but is not so the sound quality is poor directly from an lp record you can hear a lot clicks on every song of this album
3,Ok..but need non-slip feet!,"These are a great idea, but they still slip around on my plate! I almost lost a couple good tacos to the cats! I might try another taco holder gagit or try to some how make these work better...non slip feet?"
2,A Small Step For Mankind,"This is a book for ""dipping into"" for refreshmentrather than ""reading through"" for enlightenment. Theaphorisms or sophisms are not especially unique and now, I've discovered, the author is willing to send them to you from his SYNPAN website (on a permanent daily subscription basis). Some publishers would not be so generous with reprint rights, so we must assume this one is committed to getting Pappas' universal message ""out there."" Most of the other books Sparrow Hawk Press has published have considerably more substance than this one does and address matters of meditation and esoteric Christianity, dreamwork and a renewal of ritual in this age which seems intent upon shifting its paradigm from personal to collective wellness, from religiosity to spirituality, from dogma-without to divinity-within. The diligent seeker will pursue a fuller course meal than this appetizer supplies."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This coat rack wouldn't receive a passing grade in a Junior High School woodshop class! If I could give it 0 stars, I would. ALL of the pegs were loose and none could be tightened as ALL of the screws were stripped. I felt as if I just flushed my $ down the toilet. As my husband eloquently remarked, this coatrack is a piece of cr**p!"
3,Not a blanket!!!,"Please understand this is NOT a blanket! It's long and narrow (smaller than a standard bath towel), it is designed to be heated and used to relax you. I like it a lot, but had I known what it actually was, I would not have purchased it.That being said, it smells wonderful and has a nice weight to it. I use it on stressful, sleepless nights to help soothe raw nerves, but I could have saved $40 and sprinkled lavender oil on my heating pad!"
3,HEATING PROBLEMS,"I had no idea I had to heat the inside pillow in a self-turning microwave. My microwave does not turn and is small, so I have not been able to do much. I tried to return the item but it had to be in its original covers, so I till have it with me without much use..."
5,"More, more, more!","If you're looking for a book with great characters, hilarious dialogue and giddy exploits, Maddy Hunter's Passport to Peril is for you (Evanovich fans, take note). At one point, a random comment about the health hazards of Irish breakfasts turns into a game of Telephone/Chinese Whispers, culminating in a stampede on the cereal bar. This alone is worth the price of admission. My whole family loves these books."
1,Sweet sixteen-,"This was a dreadful attempt at humor or a worse attempt at a mystery. The plot (?) is highly improbable and the writing made me feel as if I were back in high school reading a ""kill an afternoon"" sort of book. I am all for humor in mysteries (Sharon Mc Crumb's humor was superb in her early books) but this was SO over the top it was almost insulting."
3,A very good reference guide for REXX,"I find that when I want to write a complex program, this book along with Writing OS/2 REXX are key. What one doesn't cover in enough detail, the other does. However, since no one is perfect, there are a few mistakes in it. Example, when you are checking for the existance of a file, the example it has shows the proper responces in reverse order(it is an if then else). Regardless, I still think it is an very good reference guide."
2,...86....,"...When i heard Project 86, i was not impressed.Their songs, though hard, are somewhat messy and are somewhat boring. Nothing extremely special, but if you got some money to waste, here you go.If you are into the whole Christian rapcore, hardcore scene, I think POD has an edge on them. POD has a little more talent and more refinement. But i do not really strongly recommend this or POD.If you want descent hardcore try: Amen, Nothingface, Full Devil Jacket, or Dope...."
4,Wish I had read this sooner,"Al's book is a refreshing breath of common sense, rare to find these days... especially rare in the complex world of finance, investments, and markets. Although the professionals may know more ""stuff"" than you do, they cannot predict the future any better than you do. This book knocks some of the bluster and hype out of the profession while returning control to you, the investor. It just makes sense. I sure wish I had read this book 5 or 10 years ago, but am I glad I finally did. This stuff works."
5,"Finally, the truth!","Al's book reveals the truth about the Mutual Fund industry. I promise you, after reading this book, you will see the light. You will realize that the buy&hold strategy benefits everyone but you the investor. This book will enlighten, encourage and give you hope for better investment returns. Al's newsletter is great too. He tells you what he invests in and why. When he buys and when he sells. If you have lost hope in investing with Mutual funds, buy Al's book. You'll LOVE IT!!"
5,The real truth and nothing but the truth.,"Al Thomas' book shows you the emotionless way to invest in the stock market, whether your thing is bonds, stock or mutual funds. Find out the truth about what and why brokers tell you the same old thing over and over, basically they don't know either what is happening, they're just reading their company script to get you to sell or buy or hold, as long they are making money. They don't care about you, don't be fooled by all those cosy, soft hearted, family ads about brokers how they build retirements one investor at a time. It's their own retirement they are talking about when they say that not yours. Anyway it's a great book, learned a lot and am using the technique from now on. People that I know are also using this technique with success."
5,"I wish ""Uncle Al"" was there when I was growing up...","I wish I had a wise, street-smart ""Uncle Al"" to advise me earlier in my investing career. His advice is timeless. While reading the book, I kept thinking why couldn't I have had this advice while I was growing up? Well, my children won't be wanting - I'm buying a copy of his book for each.I use a short-term timing system and only enhanced index funds in my trading so I don't use Al's timing and fund selection technics but, other than that, my trading practices mirror his philosophy and technics almost exactly.I give this book my highest recommendation!"
2,Not pretty,Purchased for myself for a fun piece of jewelry...not pretty. I returned it because I knew it would not be worn.
5,Quality product - great for powering Christmas lights,"I have an unused 30 amp RV outlet that I wanted to use to power my Christmas lights. The problem is that I couldin't find anyone that sells an adapter from the RV style outlet to a standard 15 amp outlet. I have a boat and there are lots of options for marine plug style conversions from 30 to 15 but nothing for the RV style. The best option I could find, although quite expensive, was to purchase this cable along with teh Conntek 14153+60411 pigtail adapter. Together the pair cost about a hundred bucks - ouch!!! On the plus side, both products are very high quality and are working great. I now have plenty of power to run my lights and the three plug outlet on the extension cord is also a bonus. It is also nice that the generator cord twists into a locked position when plugged into the adapter. I would recommend this to anyone looking to do the same or looking for standard power when camping at an RV site."
1,wrong plug for my generator,should have waited till I got my generator to order this plug supposed to be L14-30 not l5-30 plug my own fault
1,"Do not buy this to go with Champion Power Equipment 46534 4,000 Watt 4-Cycle Gas Powered RV Ready Portable Generator w Wheel Kit","I bought theChampion Power Equipment 46534 4,000 Watt 4-Cycle Gas Powered RV Ready Portable Generator With Wheel Kit (CARB Compliant)as a gift for my father. Told my brother to buy this cable to go with it since I noticed other people bought this cable who had also purchased this generator. The plug on this cable does not work with this generator. The cable's plug is only slightly off, but it's off enough that you will have to spend 22 dollars to buy the correct plug. Other than that the cable appeared to be heavy duty and of good quality."
3,Zombie movie fans will enjoy this!,"Ok, so this is no 'Dawn of the Dead' but I found it a welcome installment into the Zombie genre. I'm a fan that's endlessly searched for cool new zombie movies and I've seen the worst of the worst in my efforts. 'The Dead Pit' is not that bad. It does have some slow parts in the middle, but the last 20-25 minutes is zombie hoard city! If you're like me and have to see anything zombie, rent this! With all the garbage out there nowdays, this film looks pretty good. Also, there is an uncut version of this movie out there somewhere that is said to be much more gory. I'm sure that version would be alot better, but if you can't find it, give this copy a try. It's a good little zombie flick."
3,DOWN WITH LOVE,"""DOWN WITH LOVE"", takes us back to the early 60's and tells the story of author Barabara Novak (Zellweger) who gets into the success of her book about her own points of view on love. And at the same time, falls for Catcher Block (McGregor) who tries to convince Novak that she has the same vision about love as other women. David Hyde Pierce and Tony Randall also provide some very good performances here.I never saw any of the Doris Day movies of the 60's. But I did find this movie and the DVD features to be very cute and very enjoyable. And you too will enjoy ""DOWN WITH LOVE""."
3,"Down with Love good, but watch Pillow Talk first!","Definitely watch ""Pillow Talk"" before you view ""Down with Love"". The former is pure delight. One would think the humor in a Doris Day-Rock Hudson sex comedy would be outdated by now, but to my surprise, it was not."
2,I think we've found an alternative to the Death Penalty.,"We can wipe out crime altogether if we were to show Ewan McGregor movies in the joint. Especially oneswhere he takes his shirt off.....FOUR times!OK, I thought this movie was cute...for about 5 minutes. I love Renee Zellweger, especially when her eyesare OPEN, and I think she pretty much duplicated Doris Day's walk, but she could never duplicate her presence.Maybe this film wouldnt have been such an irritant if I hadnt just watched Pillow Talk a few weeks ago,but it's pretty irritating nonetheless. The nonstop sexual innuendo and the split screen action was abysmal,and the fauxlatio was disgraceful. An ""homage to the 50's""... I don't think so."
3,Chemistry Where Are You?,"Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two stars has gone missing. I can think of many male actors who would have sizzled in this role but Ewan is not one of them. Renee does a wonderful job and so does David Hyde Pierce. Too bad the directors didn't spend some more money and get George Clooney, it is a role right up his alley."
3,Fun if forgettable retro comedy,"The Bottom Line:Down with Love was assembled with great care and the two leads (particularly McGregor) are very good in their roles, but the film suffers the main problem endemic to almost all screwball comedies--the characters are all so ridiculous that the audience doesn't give a hoot about what happens to them--and so I can't really recommend it; it's a fun film, but it's very lightweight and an agonizingly long speech by Zellweger in the third act that slows the film down to a crawl doesn't much help matters.2.5/4"
2,Not that great,Dull dull dull. Too bad since it has such great actors in it. Disappointing. zz zz zz zz zz zz
1,Poorly made,This doll doesn't meet any standards. I don't understand how it can be sold in the US. I wouldn't let a kid play with it.
5,Absolutely Stunning,"This book will have you weeping before you finish it. Without going into any sort of doctrine or dogma, Gene Edwards presents the story of a God whose love eclipses space and time. I cannot recommend this book enough. For the Christian who may be feeling burdened, lost, or unloved, this book will remind you in a most wonderful way, of why you chose to follow Christ. For someone who is exploring Christianity, this book provides a simple and beautiful perspective of ""what it's all about,"" in a nutshell."
5,Irresstible,"Being in the book business for many years, I try not to get overly excited by a pretty cover but as I browsed through FLYING FLOWERS, it literally took my breath away. This is a dazzling, spectacularly beautiful book. I bought it for my sister as a special birthday present. Share it as a source of beauty and inspiration; buy it for yourself as a gorgeous gift for no reason and every reason."
3,Duplicated songs,"I think that the recording company should have included more songs, rather than put 2 of every song on the CD. I was a little disappointed."
5,I LOVE Revelation!,"I have read some people's comments putting down the song ""Revalation"". I, for one, love this album-side jam that so much illustrates the magic of what psychedelic rock was all about. Thankfully, everyone back then was not completely driven to produce polished ""sound bite"" music that fits into some kind of commercial mold. I guess that you had to be there to fully understand. Yes, I can remember (hazily)!"
3,full disclosure -- I'm in it,"But that shouldn't stop you from laughing and pointing at the baldheaded monkeyboy in the audience shots during the filmfest at the end. Yes, I'm an extra, so what? Plus that's my hometown of Colfax, CA standing in for the fictitious, hooker-founded Chapparral, NV... and yes, I got to meet Ginger Lynn, who plays The Mayor. She had some trouble saying the few lines that were scripted for her (and you'll see that some of her lines have music playing over them instead of voice) but that's okay. I'm pretty sure dialogue is not one of her strong points. Oh yeah, and I met Mr. Stiller, who is as sweet and funny and cool as you would guess he'd be. Same of director Steven Kessler. Same of me. Just kidding; I'm a dick."
5,Hard to find market.....,It is harder to find junior size patterns... and this book is full offashion forward.... patterns kids will enjoy wearing....The sizes are generous.... so they have life... or could be knit fora larger junior size that wants a closer fit.
3,Schematics????,I do wish more of DB's books had diagrams. Schematics are essential for gaining a quick understanding of shape and fit of a pattern. Many of her patterns feature photographs that do not adequately reveal details such as the type of sleeve join.
4,Great framework for approaching network management,Provides a good basis for starting out in network management. The theory is sound and applies well to all network management systems.
3,Love this group but sound quality not great,The songs are fun and the purpose of the African's Children Choir is terrific but I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the recordings. Someone should have tried harder.
1,Music,"I haven't seen the movie but did catch the last song with the credits at the end. I was ready to buy the soundtrack for that song but from these reviews it isn't on it. Oh well. For the guy that liked the ""stop the world"" song - It is by Modern English and is called ""Melt with you"" great song and great group."
3,TO BOB KOPP,"LUV THIS MOVIE!!! SHANE WEST IS DEAD HOT, and HEY to BOB KOPP THE LAST SONG I WAS LOOKING ALSO LOOKING FOR and its called Charm Attack by Leona Naess!!! hope I could help!"
1,Incomplete soundtrack >:(,"The song during the credits ""charmed Attack"" really goes with the movie. it's ok to leave off a bad song but not the good ones. a good example- the movie the professional with Jean Reno and Nat Portman the song at the end Sting ""shape of my heart"" was left of the soundtrack what's deal with that. all soundtracks that leave off the good song get a FAT ZERO!! from me."
3,Alechia James - awesome voice,"I watched this movie by chance and immediately decided to purchase the soundtrack. Glad I did. When I heard ""Holding Back the years"", I remembered I loved this singer (even though remake of song). She sang a song in the movie ""Moonlight Over Valentino"" with Bon Jovi, Whoopi Goldberg, Gwenyth Paltrow, Kathleen Turner and more (awesome movie - more on a female level). Her voice is unique. Going to look if she has own CD. ""Play that funky Music"" is always good."
1,Doesn't work with Motorola RAZR V3M,"As far as FM Transmitters go, this one probably works as good as any of them out there. This unit shuts off after 60 sec. of no radio signal. According to Belkin tech support, there is no way to override this timeout. Because the RAZR uses a mini USB headphone jack, the user has to use the headset adapter (supplied with the phone or bought separately), an adapter to convert from 2.5 to 3.5, and then you can plug in to the FM transmitter. Because of all of these adapters, it doesn't see a radio signal therefore will only remain powered on for 1 minute at a time. Pretty darn useless for RAZR owners."
2,It decreased the loudness!!,"I bought these SRS-P7 Sony speakers for about 9 dollars and knew it was going to be nothing special. When I plugged them into my laptop, I expected the speakers to amplify a louder volume of music compared to the stock laptop speakers and it turned out...the laptop won by a wide margin. I tuned the volume up to max on the laptop and the sound was just too low coming out from the speakers. The product is just sad in every way in terms of quality and highly recommend that you do not waste your hard earned money on this."
1,Doesn't do anything,this speaker doesn't do anything...It's not as loud as my laptop's internal speaker...
1,Should have read these reviews first.,"I should have checked reviews before I purchased these worthless Sony emblems,,, they certainly are not speakers. Can't hear them hooked to laptop, iPod or anything else I have tried. If I set them on my shoulders and listen very closely, I can almost hear them. Total garbage,,, if I could give them a ZERO I would."
3,Not really worth for 10$,"I too bought this speaker for my mp3 player and its not really good. Even with the maximum volume i can hardly hear anything.I suggest if people want to buy speakers for usb mp3player, please go for some good ones which has a inbuilt or external amplification with sound controls in it..."
2,Not good,"First off. I didnt buy these on Amazon, bought at Walgreens. Only 5 bucks. I hookup to my laptop and can barely hear anything with the volume of my computer all the way up. Hooked them up with iPod a little better but not much better. I'm not gonna complain to much because its only 5 bucks but they're garbage in my opinion."
1,it's cheap and you don't get what you paid for.,"I was looking for speakers that i did not need an a/c adaptor for so that I could let other people hear my music and listen to it without being connected to the player by wires.<br /><br />the pros:<br />-cheap<br />-very portable<br /><br />the cons:<br />-too cheap<br />-volume roughly reaches voice level<br />-no bass (but what did you expect)<br />-poor sound quality (a didn't expect great sound quality, but no matter what volume i play at the sound has an echo sound like it's coming from within a tube or down a tunnel.<br /><br />I opened them with a little hesitation thinking I'd only lose $10, but the minute i heard sound come from them i realized that was a quick $10 to drop. I wasn't looking for good speakers, but but i was hoping for passable ones."
2,Not Powered Speakers...,This speakers are a waste of money. You can barely hear the sound out of them and the sound quality is terrible. I would recomend some powered (bateries or external) speakers.
1,Worse than a tin can,"I got these speakers as a gift and I plugged them into my iBook G4, hoping they would bring a little bit more sound quality than the itty bitty ones on the laptop. They sounded worse than if the sound was coming from a can, and they are very quiet."
3,Quite good,"That's difficult finding Amy Foster and A Personal Record together, and they're so interesting. But the book has no introduction, index or table of contents. In addition it hasn't the author's not to A Personal Record. Anyway you should read that if you like Conrad. You'll understand better his oeuvre."
5,The Best Greatest Hits CD Ever!,"Even if you aren't yet a fan of John Berry's, you will be after listening to his greatest hits. This is an excellent cd, and it will make you wonder why he isn't currently on top of the country charts."
1,Lifestyles.................,"30 minutes into this movie, I pondered a very significant question: Why the the heck am I watching this movie......Then, I proceeded to nearest exit shaking my head.Cuba Gooding Jr is a great actor, no doubt. This movie (the 30 minutes, that I could tolerate) left me feeling as if this was just a homsexual comedy and geared to people of that particular ""lifestyle"". This made the movie exremely unappealing. I don't consider myself homophobic. I and several other males simply got up and left to never comeback. If you aren't very tolerant or fond of this particular ""lifestyle"", don't waste your hard earned money. Much better off going to watch ""Dream Catcher""."
1,Oh ... My ... God ...,"Wow! This movie is something - I'm not sure what, but it is something. Gay men, straight men, and women are all stereotyped and lampooned - but it is never funny. At the same time, it is never really offensive either. Some raunchy, supposedly comedic sex and nudity scenes are neither really comedic nor sexy. Even in that teenage-boy-wants-to-see-some-boobs way. It is so weird.I can't even really describe how awful it is, but I couldn't turn it offer either because I had to keep watching to somehow justify it's existence. Why did Cuba Gooding do this? Has Roger Moore blown through all his cash? With all the scripts floating around, who read this and said - yes, this is the one, let's make it!I haven't asked myself so many questions since Philosophy 101."
3,Funny,"The comedy in this film wasn't really that great, the funny bits were mostly one liners and the plot wasn't too deep. After buying and watching the DVD I must say it didn't live up to the expectations I had to begin with but it was funny in it's own way.It's a movie that can make anyone laugh, regardless of what your comedic preferences are, and so I give this 3 stars, its a fun movie and anyone who likes movies will find this worth watching."
3,could have been better,"A few wonderful sauce recipes, however it definitely is a buy I wish I could take back. The sauce recipes included seem to be written out in complex formulas...when they can easily be simplified and still be just as wonderful. I found my other cookbooks are often of much more use when it comes to learning the basics of sauces. This book is very out-dated."
1,Not what I expected.,I was very disappointed with this cookbook.I was a gift for my grandson who is working as a chef and really wanted this book very much. I was embarassed to give it the way it was. It came without a dust cover and it also was dented on the binder. Not Happy.
1,almost SILENT - useless!,"I ordered this because of the complaints about the 'old fashioned' mechanical timers. This is almost silent. YES as you let time go by the beeps increase in frequency...going from ""beep...beep...beep"" to beepbeepbeepbeep.But heaven help you if you are in another room or even across the room. I had this timer set on a shelf less than 2 feet away from me, the tv news is on and the TV drowned out the timer. I may well return this, even though the packaging was shredded in the effort to extract it. I want my 15 year old mechanical back!!!!"
4,Very pretty but does not work!!!,"Came quickly, but poorly packaged & without instructions. UPS damaged & was not able to deliver the first one. Can't get the second one to work; looked at the on-line customer instructions & tips. I gave it 4 stars in the hope that my review would be posted. Amazon is only posting good reviews on all items at this time."
3,"Works well, but...","I've had this timer for almost a year now. While it works well & keeps time well, the most maddening thing about this timer is that you can't tell when it's set! The blinking light is so hard to see, and it doesn't tick, so I have to cup my hand over the light to make sure it's blinking and therefore timing. Poor design."
2,Loud ring? Not hardly...,"I purchased this timer because it was described as having a ""loud ring,"" and I need a timer that I can hear from 30 feet away.I'd like to meet the person for whom this timer is ""loud."" I can hear it in the same room, but not from the room down the hall.I wish rings would be described in decibels. Meanwhile, I guess I'll keep looking, but now for a timer with a ""deafening ring.""Otherwise, it works as advertised."
1,no good,"do not buy, it is no good. keep your money and buy it at a dept store.I will try to return it,if I can."
1,Worked twice then quit . . .,During the two times it worked the alarm was too soft and could not be heard from the next room. Complete waste of money.
3,Great content...but...,"I bought the book for presenting some of Gods' word to those in my congregation brave enough to endure a quarter with me on Wednesday nights. I found it to be the best lesson book regarding fellowship available. At least the content is the best. The printing leaves much to be desired. One of our older members had trouble reading it. In one case, the auther mentioned some important words in a passage were in bold, but I could not distinquish bold from regular text. The print is awful, the font a poor choice. I think the publisher did not do the auther justice.But, if you can get passed the printing, it is a pretty good book.A servant, Jim"
4,Same UPC number DIFFERENT song listing:,"I have this cd single whose UPC number is 0 7502-12375-2 0 which matches with Amazon but yet the track listing differes.Firstly this is a LIVE version of the hit song which appears in the 1980s movie The Breakfast Club. According to the linear notes, this version was recorded live at the Ahoy Rotterdam on December 3rd of 1985. While there was an extended 12"" version of this song, the version that appears here is a live version, but it IS longer at 9:02Secondly there are 3 songs on this cd single including the title song.Finally the second track is not called ""Brass Band in African Chimes"" but ""Bass Line"" and the third song which is not mentioned on Amazon is called The American.Here are the songs:1. Don't You (Forget About Me)(Live) 9:022. Bass Line 4:373. The American 3:33"
1,bring a high I.Q.!!!,"I am an avid toy collector. In my opinion, this game is too challenging. It is for ages 8+ I am an intelligent 28 yr old and cannot clear puzzle 3 of 1000. You might want to try before you buy, or it could become another useless plastic dust collector. hope this helps!"
2,No updates!,Last update: Monday.Today: Wednesday.This isn't a great way to get your news. It is a great way to see what happened two days ago though.
5,A great second newspaper!,"I wouldn't get this as my only daily newspaper. But it's a great, economical addition to my commuter train and subway rides. I read my own city's daily and don't have the time or budget to read the full NYT. This provides 12-20 stories updated throughout the day. Good mix of news and features. No columnists, editorials. Few business and sports articles. But that's not what I want."
5,Perfect!,"This is beyond exceptional in comparison to any other subscription I've reviewed. Pictures, frequent updates, plenty of news stories. Several hours of stories to scan through and read at your leisure, for two bucks a month. After seeing several that create two crummy updates every couple months, this should be a mandatory subscription if you want news."
2,"Good news, Not relable","It is a good summary of what's going on, well written, etc. However, I haven't received an update in four days, not the first time this has happened. I do get 5 bars on 3G connectivity, so something else is going on. I just canceled."
2,Not shareable to family kindles,"I am disappointed to find out that my subscription to this blog does not extend to the kindles which I just gifted to our children. Only one kindle may be selected to receive the blog and it does not even show up in the archive for our others to access. Upon exploring this problem with Amazon, I learned this is not a mistake, but at the design of NYTimes. The NYTimes should update their delivery design as often families now have multiple kindles.If I were a print subscriber to this newspaper, all members of the household would be able to freely view the material. To limit family access like this makes no sense and defeats the purpose of our family kindle experience and lessens the educational value of this subscription. I will have to rethink whether to continue with this one or not.So heads up, this will ONLY WORK on ONE kindle if you are looking...."
4,Great content--but a little bit of a hassle to use.,"The subscription gives you the meat of the New York Times--no potatoes, no salad, and no dessert. The top two or three national and international stories of the day are covered, and then there are a couple of feature articles about some interesting topic. These are ""New York Times"" quality articles--well written and well researched.For the modest cost, obviously there is a trade-off. There is no regular business or sports coverage. This will not replace your local newspaper. But, for the cost of less than $.10 a day, this is a steal.The only complaint is about getting updates. You have to ""restart"" the system (i.e., you have to go into the menu and do a system restart. The ""slider bar"" off/on switch doesn't work.) Come on Amazon...you can do better than that."
4,SKX031,"Arrived in good time, packaged well. A fantastic watch, my first submariner homage and I'm very pleased with it. Yes, the bracelet is cheap looking and a bit ""rattly"" but the watch itself is first class."
1,Barely made it to page eighteen.,"Persevered to page 18. If you have adolescent children; no, pre-adolescent children, and love to listen to them talk with each other in a stunted vocabulary full of misogyny, off-color language and gross descriptions of bodily fluids, guts, brains oozing out of ears you'll love this book. If you don't stick, with Steven Saylor and John Maddox Roberts."
3,Decent Historical Noir,"As a lover of historical mystery novels (particularly those set in classical Rome) and Ovidian poetry, I was quite excited to find this novel.That lasted until I began reading, at which point I received quite a jolt. The language was coarse and concise, and left me feeling as though I'd inadvertently been dropped into a poor imitation of a Phillip Dick novel.I persisted through that and found the novel improved as it progressed, but I felt the storyline--while meant to be suspenseful bordering on horror--felt forced and flat while the narrator had such a modern sensibility that most of the feel of the classical environment of the novel felt supressed.If read with different expectations, as primarily a noir mystery novel as opposed to novel about the life and times of Ovid, I feel the book is probably decent, though not particularly brilliant."
3,funny,The story is Ok but it is kind of corny- with the modern talk. I am not finished but I have not stopped reading so I guess its not too bad.
5,Gift,"Bought for a gift, so I haven't listened to it yet, but looks awesome. No cracks in case, very nice."
1,Disappointing,"Billy Preston was certainly a great talent. I purchased this CD because of the duet with Syreeta ""With You I'm Born Again"" as it is such a beautiful song. I was hoping to hear some other great performances by Billy but, unfortunately, I was disappointed with the rest of the CD."
5,Understanding the Future of War,"Hy Rothstein has written one of the great books on modern warfare. It is a well written and thoroughly researched evaluation of the US Military's ability to wage unconventional warfare in the modern age, through the lens of the Afghan campaign in Operation Enduring Freedom.What began as a stunning example of modern unconventional warfare using special forces partnering with local forces and precision air power was replaced with conventional troops conducting major ""cordon and sweep"" operations. The result can be seen in the news every day, as a resurgent Taliban has swept back in from the Pakistani tribal areas to wreak havoc on Afghanistan.This book is a critical read for modern policy makers, military professionals, and anyone looking to understand warfare in the modern world."
4,Great item,"A great item. I bought two, and the quality far surpasses the one it replaces from a certain shack chain of stores. a little pricey though."
4,"Some Great Live Blues from B.B. King, 4 and 1/4 stars.","I've read some incredible reviews for this album and don't get me wrong this album is fantastic. But there's a little to much singing and not enough classic b.b. guitar work, espically on the second half of the album. The first half of the album cranks out some great classics and the second half has some moments but the first five songs are the best. If you love more jazzy blues (like some of b.b.'s stuff) this album is your nirvana. Although I do like b.b.'s style like that, with a little touch of jazz, I expected some more incredible blues pouring from lucille. This album still remains fantastic and has some incredible music. Best songs: ""Everyday I Have the Blues"", ""Sweet Little Angel"", ""It's My Own Fault"" and ""How Blue Can You Get?"""
4,Have You read The Clue in the diary yet?,Titan blonde Nancy Drew has a real nak for getting involved in a mystery. When Foxy Felix's expensive estate explodes into a huge fire Nancy and her friends Bess and George naturally go and check out the burning house. When Nancy goes ahead around the other side of the burning estate looking for survivors she spots a strange and mysterious figure running away from the scene of the crime. She finds two clues at the scene one including a diary that is completely written in Sweedish. She gets in some real trouble and the only people who can help her are three friends and her dad.I liked the Nancy Drew book The Clue in the Diary because it was a little slow in the begining but then got gradually into a real page turning book. I would stay up till 11:00 pm just reading this book it was so good. It really taught you the lesson what goes around comes around. I really reccomend this wonderful mystery to all!
3,eh,"A couple of songs worth listening to, but not very many I could actually play at my 80s party. Wouldn't have bought if I had been more careful about what songs were on it."
2,Bought for a specific song,"I bought this mainly for the Solieri Version of Rock Me Amadeus. It is the version but shorter, over a minute, than the original. I wish I could find where to download/buy the exact version that came on Falco 3 released in the US back in 1985. Anyway, with 18 songs on this CD, if you like 9 or more of the songs ... it's worth buying. If you only like a couple of the songs, you would probably be better off buying them from downloads."
3,the first one was better,"More Pure 80's is a great album, but it has mediocre content. The first album was much better and it included better songs. The song that I am really disappointed with is the song from the Eurythmics. Why was ""Would I like to you"" featured on this? ""Here Comes The Rain Again"" was a bigger hit than that."
3,Better than you,"People are way too quick to diss the new album by the Dandy Warhols. The Warhols needed to do Odditorium to break through the catharsis of their slicked-out image, fueled by their recent Monkey House campaign. Odditorium is the album the Dandys had to put out to give themselves a chance to reinvent themselves. What people should be saying instead of ""..not as good as their older records.."" is ""..can't wait to hear what they'll do next!.."" Now that, true believers, is an exciting prospect. This album tosses aside all preconceptions of what is a great album, and tests your ears, and that is the bravest thing a musician can do nowadays."
2,what happened?,"I think Courtney Taylor-Taylor took too many drugs before making this album... I saw him on telly in Australia today and he couldn't string a sentence together, which is the best analogy I can think of for this album- pointless, meandering. Admittedly, Smoke It is a really good song."
2,Welcome to the Boring House,"What a shame... After four good records, onde of USA's more promising indie bands delivers an album that really fails to impress. The Dandy Warhols have always been a bit pretensious and self-indulgent, but this time they haven't enough strong songs to make up for that and the result is a mess. Overlong, unininspired and poorly written, most of the tracks here wouldn't be good enough as b-sides, and even the better ones show little staying power. I like experimentation, but this is almost unlistenable."
5,This is how it is...,"This album is completely amazing. There are people who don't get it. Well, they don't get it. Anyone complaining about the length of any song needs to be listening to Incubus or Hillary Duff because they don't know good music when they hear it. This entire record is amazing and blows away everything they have ever done. This album is like every great moment from the last record rolled into one and stretched over the course of an hour. Listening to this was the greatest 62 minutes of my life and I am being completely serious. Halfway through this album I was thinking, man I am so glad to be alive. My friend was listening to it with me and he said, I wish I could be in a band like this! Any other rock band really interested in making awesome music has to be in cold sweats after hearing this because this is just amazing stuff and that's the end of it. That's the end of it, everybody with taste go out and buy it because it is worth every penny."
4,Hard days 4 DW,"Ja sam jako veliki fan benda i tesko mi je da priznam ali ovo je jako veliki minus za Dandy Warhols, tri koraka nazad. Album zvuci nedovrseno bez forme, cak se ne moze svrstati ni u formu eksperimentalnog. Nije bas sve tako crno, ima i svetlih momenata kao recimo Love Is The New Feel Awful, Smoke It i Down Like Disco, ali bojim se da to nije dovoljno.Album zasluzuje 3, ali kao veliki fan poklanjam 4."
4,...,"Not the BEST Dandy's album. But still a good one. It's not full of hits, and I'm sure that was intentional. It's different than ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" and anything before that. But definitely still The Dandy Warhols, and definitely worth it."
2,"""Cynic"" is right!","This is not quite what I expected. It is written from a cynic's perspective, so in that regard it is amusing. However, it is also written in an affirmation format, so if one were to really use this book as an affirmation guide, it could easily generate a very dark and angry perspective. Therefore, I suggest you read it, have a few laughs, take it with a grain of salt, then put it aside."
5,"a scary, suspenseful ride of a book","I have just finished reading ""After"" and find myself feeling much the same way as the first time I saw Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Tristram does with language what Hitchcook did with film. She cooks up a suspenseful, scary ride that leaves you totally wrung out at the end, and unable to shake the experience you just had. The prose is as good as any ""literary"" novel but it reads as easily as the latest Michael Crichton thriller. This book is not for those who just want mild entertainment in their reading. The author breaks more than one ""taboo"" and that's part of the book's power. I am still thinking about it."
3,Duplicate spices,"Got this as a Christmas gift. Pretty neat set, but I did get 5 duplicate spices. I'll call/email the company and see if they will send the correct ones. (To match the names on the lids.)The ""free"" spices are a pretty good deal, even with the s&h.; It comes out to about $1 per spice on refill bags based on what I've found on other sites."
3,Buyer Beware!!!,"I just received this today and I have to say I'm fairly disappointed!! The rack is nice, the glass jars are nice....receiving 8 of the same spices, not so nice! I was expecting 16 different spices not 8 that are the same!! I got two each of the pizza seasoning, coriander, marjoram and crushed mint. The rest were not duplicated. Otherwise, its a good buy. Eventually I will fill the jars with different spices and make my own labels for them."
5,Spice rack,"After taking a few cooking classes ( now that I'm single again), I was looking for a spice rack like my class had. This spice rack worked out good for the price"
3,JojoThese,"I give this 3 stars, the spices are one's you won't use much, like pizza seasoning.. I thought it would Been ones that are more used"
2,not impressed,"Not impressed, the rack it self it put together poorly and looks bad.Luckily I have it back in a corner and you can not see all the flawsI would not recommend this spice rack"
2,"As Feared, Broken Product... would be nice otherwise","Well I took a risk, despite the reviews saying ordering online will result in a broken product. Sure enough, mine was broken as well. The wood part was clearly snapped before it was packaged, and a piece of the broken wood isn't even in the box (thus can not be glued). Two screws were laying in the bottom of the box, and clearly had never even been screwed in. The packaging was well done, but the product was disappointing. It might have been nice if it wasn't. The spices I received included chives, gourmet sea salt, italian seasoning, bay leaves, season salt, parsley, marjoram, celery salt, basil, pizza seasoning, rosemary, herbes de provence, oregano, fennel seed, coriander, and crushed mint. They are not common, which I expected, based on other reviews but I planned to replace the majority of them anyway. I am being offered a product exchange, without paying the shipping or return shipping, so hopefully the next box won't hold any surprises."
5,Go Mary!!!,"I've read this book already, and am reading it again for battle of the books at my school, and I thought it was going to be annoying, because I already know the plot, but it was just as exciting as the first time I read it."
5,Deadlands the Weird West Revised,"Far better than the d20 version of this game (and I happen to like d20). This version of the game makes good use of the poker game and poker chips mechanics that makes it feel like Deadlands instead of some generic weird tales game that happens to be set in the old West.For my money, this is the best version of Deadlands out there."
5,Outstanding and refreshing,"This album is fun, inspiring and a joy to listen to. I love dc Talk's version of ""Spirit in the Sky"" and Edwin McCain's soulful, ""Jesus, He loves me"" will always be a favorite. The best thing is to hear a collection of positive songs being sung by so many popular artists. Thanks to the record producers, Sparrow Records, Capital Records and CBS for this gem. I'm telling everyone about it."
5,Is DVD afraid of 'The Fog'?,"I only have one comment. Why is this film, (John Carpenter's 2nd best film - Halloween is #1 of course), NOT available on DVD? PLEASE! We are officially asking the powers that be - give this great film the DVD treatment it deserves..."
3,The Fog is a horror movie classic,John Carpenter's The Fog is probably one of the most original horror movies I have ever seen. The element of surprise is truly one of Carpenter's gifts in his movies. The Fog is one of those movies you tend to think about after viewing it. It is truly a classic
3,One of Carpenter's better movies,"This is John Carpenter's follow-up to Halloween (one of the best movies ever). This movie doesn't quite measure-up. It's scary, but it does not have memorable characters. It's a creepy and in-your-face horror movie.The extras on the DVD, like on The Thing, tell you everything you'd want to know about the movie, and TOO MUCH MORE. A huge problem with DVD extras is that it tends to treat every film as if it were Citizen Kane. It could use a lot of editing. Listening to the principals talk about the film, it's difficult to tell if they think it is a success or not. Unfortunately, every time I've seen John Carpenter lately (in person or on TV) he seems like he's smoked a few too many doobies to ever form a coherent thought again. It's a shame because he had so much talent."
3,"3 1/2 stars - moves a little slow, but very suspenseful","Here's a great story with a cool looking fog effect. The acting and directing are gtreat in this film, but it just moves along too slowly, and it felt a little predictable. The cinematography is outstanding and the eeriness of the fog encroaching on land is captured very well. Overall a nice suspense film with little gore, but some very classic imagery.Check out ""The Thing""... another of Carpenter's great horror films."
5,As Good As Horror Movies Get,"All I can say is watch the final scene with the priest, it just keeps getting funnier"
4,A Spooky Classic,"John Carpenter's 'The Fog' has all the elements of a great ghost story, and is one of his best films. I have seen the advanced copy of this DVD (perhaps it is a Region 2 version), and the transfer was very solid. My American Carpenter coterie should really enjoy this DVD- that is, when it is actually realeased in the USA. For those exposed to modern horror films only- take a look at this film- its a true classic 'ghost story', unlike anything recent. Read the rest of the reviews for this film, and you will see how desperately this film needs to be released on Region 1 DVD. Its really a good film."
2,The Fog,"This is a disappointing follow up for John Carpenter after the exceptional ""Halloween"". Jamie Lee Curtis stars in this early 80s horror romp (what a surprise) about nineteenth-century colonists back from the dead who terrorize a modern-day fishing village. ""The Fog"" lacks any real thrills and no major plot developments, as well as wasting the talents of Curtis and Barbeau. Look for Janet Leigh (""Psycho"") who is actually Jamie Lee Curtis's real life mother. Certainly not one of the better Carpenter efforts. Director: John Carpenter. Cast: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau, John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Janet Leigh. Rated R for violence and profanity. 91 minutes."
1,The Most Boring Movie EVAH!!!!,"My sister invited me over to watch this movie. I love scary movies and such so I was initially really happy to see this. The concept was a good one. The basic underlying plot was good. The story, however, was SOOOOOOO boring and drawn out. I mean, hardly anything even happened and the scenes of them freaking out in the water just felt idiotic and overacted.JUST when the movie started to get awesomely interesting...the credits began to roll! Yeah, the GOOD stuff happens at the absolute very end. Just when you get interested, you get cut off. It was a waste of my time and just boring all around. I can enjoy a good crappy movie like The Nun, or Tiki, or some other cheesy cult classic, but this was an extremely CRAPPY crappy movie."
3,"very useful, if you like a japanese - style house","very practical,my house has plenty of stuff inside, it gave me the force of throwing away a lot.It is written for women with many children, which in North Italy are now rare.I personally am single.Neat statements, useful advice. For me, their ideal rooms are too much empty."
4,DVD is very good quality...,Coming from DK3(that's the copy I have)...the movie is one of their best ones (if you know anything about DK3). Picture is clear. Sound is clear. This is a great movie. Quality is excellent for such an old movie.
2,ROMANCE AND WESTERNS JUST DON'T MIX,"A GUNFIGHTER [JOHN WAYNE] TRYS TO LIVE A STRAIGHT LIFE AFTER FALLING FOR A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN [GAIL RUSSELL]. BUT BEFORE HE CAN, HE MUST TAKE CARE OF SOME RIVALS FIRST. JUST LIKE WESTERNS DON'T WORK WELL AS MUSICALS, THEY DON'T WORK WELL AS ROMANCE MOVIES EITHER. IT SIMPLY MOVES TOO SLOW AND IT FOCUSES TOO MUCH ON ITS LOVE STORY. BUT, JOHN WAYNE IS QUITE CONVINCING AND THE FEW ACTION SCENES THAT'RE IN THIS MOVIE, ARE ALL GOOD. IF THERE WAS MORE ACTION, THIS WOULD'VE BEEN A GREAT MOVIE."
1,Stay away.,"Kevin Hart is one of the funniest and most charismatic comedians out there today, but you'll never get through this one because the audio quality is so subpar. It's almost like it was shot on somebody's VHS-C camcorder and released as an afterthought. It was filmed at the LAFF HOUSE in Philly, my hometown, so I'm reluctant to come off as a hater but save your money. But Kevin tells a lot of the same jokes on his Comedy Central special, which isn't yet on DVD (TiVo it). And he comes off much, much better on his GROWN LITTLE MAN DVD from Image."
1,This phone is a piece of junk!! I was so diappointed in GE!,"My other phone was getting old and I needed a replacement. I thought the idea of the extra handset was great. I bought the phone and set it up. I was not that pleased with the reception but lost the receipt so I figured I'd keep using it. Well, the distance stunk, couldn't get more than 20 feet away from the base and the static and crackle was horrible. Then the buttons on one handset would not work properly. I was down to one handset because the first one was junk. I will never buy another General Electric cordless phone as I feel like I threw away $80.00! I have since replaced this phone with a Vtech which is wonderful! Difference of night and day! Don't buy this GE phone unless you want to waste your money!"
3,"Useful, but not complete","This 400 page guide covers eight lower level DSST examinations: Business Mathematics, Ethics in America, Human Resource Management, Introduction to Business, Organizational Behavior, Personal Finance, Principles of Financial Accounting, and Principles of Supervision. By taking these exams, you could possibly earn 24 credit hours.While this is a great study guide, it was useless for what I purchased it for - upper level credit examinations. I was misled into thinking it contained more exams than it does.If you are preparing for those eight exams, it contains a pretest, presents the material and then has a sample examination, and would be a very useful resource in my opinion. Just not useful for me."
4,Good starting point for using college credit exams,This book gives a good introduction to dsst and college credit exams. I just finished my degree and have earned over 80 credits using exams. (...)
2,JUST TOOK EXAM TODAY!!!!!!!!,"DO NOT USE THIS BOOK AS YOUR ONLY SOURCE FOR STUDY FOR ANY OF THESE EXAMS. I REPEAT DO NOT DO IT. I TOOK HR MANAGEMENT TODAY AND HERES TO YOUR HEALTH DSST EXAMS. I THOUGHT HR MANG. WAS GOING TO BE SO EASY, MAN WAS I WRONG THAT REVIEW DIDNT EVEN COME CLOSE TO 15 OUT OF 99 QUESTIONS IT WILL BE A MIRACLE IF I PASSED THAT ONE.(...) HOPE THIS HELPS."
4,Highly Recommend,"After a great deal of online searching for a tow behind broadcast spreader, I purchased the Precision Product 6-series 130 pound tow behind bradcast spreader and have nothing but praise for the product. Only short coming would be trying to determine the proper setting for spreading Scott's Turfbuilder Lawn Fertilizer-- trial and error. If precision did a study and provided a chart for application of such products, it would have been 5 stars."
4,She still ugly...,Don't get me wrong TAMAR IS A GOOD SINGER AND ALL BUT SHE UGLY. SHE LOOK LIKE A FROG.
4,"Good Job, Tamar","This album was not one that I rushed out and bought initially. Maybe, I should have because after I did, I really liked it. Next to her big sister, Toni's album, I listen to it a lot. It was a well put together album. I'm a fan of the Braxton family. I have all of Toni's albums, Tamar's and the one put out by the Braxton sisters, which I enjoyed as well. Thanks for providing good, quality, work. Hang in there and I think sales will go up in future. This album would make a good gift. Treat yourself or someone else. I believe that they will be surprised ... In a Good Way!"
4,TAMAR TAMAR TAMAR,"I think tamar has a great debut ive been waiting for this album for awhile.1 thing i dont understand is why is everyone saying if you dont wnna love me is her first single its her second assholes get none was her first and she ha a video with jd and amil my favorite songs are no disrespect, your room, money cant buy you love, words, get mine and tonite"

3,kvalitet -men inte mer.,bra kvalitetsmusik detta..dock inte deras bästa. Är ngot som saknas p denna ang. ltar/energi.Som helhet en trevlig skiva.
4,Strong early American novel,"""Edgar Huntly"" represents the early American epistolary novel at its finest. It provides the opportunity to give historical and cultural insight and at the same time, does so in language that does not alienate the 21st century reader. A relatable and adventurous narrator keeps the rich plot moving through a cast of exciting characters, intriguing turns, and vast and thrilling adventure.Some may be displeased with recurring incidences of sexism and racism, and while they are certainly noteworthy, the context of the book ought to be considered; it was first published in 1799, an era where such ideas were the norm (while this does not necessarily make them ""good"" or ""acceptable"", it does shed insight on the thoughts of the times). This aside, the text has much to offer, and we as readers have much to learn from it. Depictions of a still-wild American landscape excite the heart and tense drama pulls the mind along."
1,junior g-men (alpha video),poor rating is for poor quality of this video. i love the dead end kids but this is sadly unwatchable
5,Love it!,We buy this every year for xmas gifts and save some for us to enjoy also! Wish they still would sale them in town so I wouldn't have to order them! Yummy!
5,Simply Divine!,"While I was not at all happy with the packing materials used to ship this little beauty, I must say this watch is STUNNING! It is even better than described and for the price----absolutely amazing! My girlfriend loved it. Thanks AMAZON!"
5,"N-Toon, The next phenomenon?","N-Toon,is a great group! They have voices that are great,and they sing about real life stuff! They show their versatility in singing by doing both slow love songs to fast rap songs. They sing about stuff kids want to know about. I truly brlieve they'll be making history,and a new fad just being who they are!"
1,Not quite a z-movie,"El Chupacabra is by far, the worst movie I have seen in the last few years. Imagine a horror film where the ""monster"" looks like a retarded chimp that's been punched in the face a few too many times, and has fallen into a vat of green dye. In spite of the fact that it's less than 3 feet tall and moves like it's doing the potty dance in slow motion, it manages to kill several stupid humans that aren't smart enough to just kick it like a football and beat it with a stick. Sadly, the monster being on-screen is the highlight of this movie, as the acting is horrible. I rented this movie expecting a really bad, d-movie, and it exceeded my expectations by far."
