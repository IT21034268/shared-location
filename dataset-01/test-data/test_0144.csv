5,Best study Bible!,"I love this Bible - I make sure this is the Bible our church gets for our graduation gifts for the seniors every year - it's also the Bible I bought my wife. The print is clear, and it's a durable Bible with lots of accurate notes."
4,Bleak and beautifull,"Drake's third album is free of the orchestral texturing of 'Five Leaves Left', and the sacherine tunesmithery of 'Bryter Layter', both fine albums, but neither approaching the stark emotional honesty of the tale from a brocken soul that is 'Pink Moon'. It's beauty lies in it's directness and the way in which the combination of Drake's voice and guitar are able to sounds infinitely sad whilst remaining heart-breakingly poetic. A genuinely lovely record."
5,25 Minutes To Heaven,"It's impossible listen to Pink Moon without tears in the eyes. Drake's would be dead months later and music would be in the listeners minds forever. But the sound made by that 25 years-old englishman with his words and single guitar remains stronger than poetry, than VW commercials (that I didn't and I won't see here in Brazil), than all the simple things. This disc is a statement of life and how big it can be, Drake is saying death is possible. And only someone who knew the life can say it."
3,Pleasant Listening,"This album was recommended by Jeff Tweedy in a WSJ ""Hit List"" column and sounded interesting. I was not disappointed by what I heard but obviously do not appreciate it as much as Mr. Tweedy. I believe that someone who is into the finer points of acoustic guitar playing would really enjoy this album."
5,Unspeakably lovely,"Yes, I'm here thanks to VW. And thank you VW! One has to marvel at advertisers who could capture in video the stunning, quiet beauty of this CD. ""Pink Moon"" is just the intro to a rich world you'll want to return to over and over again. I'd say buy it now, but I think you'll want Drake's box set after hearing this. I do. And if you like this, I'd recommend Elliott Smith and Sarah Dougher, both sensitive savvy singer/songwriters who also happen to be alive."
5,Relaxing and wonderful,"I didn't get into the album at first; mostly listened to the title track. But one day I listened to it while stressed out over a test, and kept listening over and over. The songs are lovely, simple, and always leave you wanting more. Nick Drake has a fantastic voice perfectly matched to his songs, which are best heard in a car with the windows down at night, looking at the stars through the moonroof.My favorite tracks besides Pink Moon are Road, Which Will, and Things Behind the Sun, but all are excellent."
5,Sharp and user friendly,"I bought this knife for my husband as a Christmas gift, and surprisingly he also bought one for me! We laughed it off and intended on returning one until we actually used one of them. We quickly concluded that we each needed one. It is fantastic! The handle is comfortable and the design of the knife offers great range of motion. After a few years of use (I think 4+)the knives are still razor sharp needing no maintenance. It is a little large for a paring knife but I quickly got used to the difference in size. I highly recommend this knife!"
4,Bleed your brakes the easy way,"No more waiting on another person to help you pump the brakes -- this power bleeder makes bleeding brakes a one person job. Be careful to not exceed 20 PSI, or the brake fluid may leak from the reservoir (all you really need is 15-17 PSI). One nit: I wish the drain tube included was longer."
1,Stay away,"If you're looking for some of the old school music you heard in the movie, then keep on going. You won't find it here."
1,Absolutely Useless! So is CSCI477.,"This book is absolutely useless. The methodology taught is not ""extreme"", but rather ridiculous...His techniques will never be applied in actual software engineering, as they are completely impractical. For half of the ideas that are practical, they are simply common sense. Such as the 4 values: communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. Every decent software engineer practices these values. In addition, the author fills up pages by telling stories of his childhood and other needless tales in an attempt to convince the reader that the techniques explained, truely work.Don't waste your time or money. You'll only be aggravated once you open this book"
2,Disappointing,"I don't recommend this book for someone on a real OO project of any size. While there are parts of the book that might be useful, many of the suggestions are downright wrong IMO from the many OO projects I've been on. CRC cards are all well and good, but they don't scale to significant commercial projects. Open group areas with desks pushed together is a bad thing, not a good thing. As much as the author wants everything to center around programming, it doesn't. Some thought in analysis and design and refactoring @ that level is more powerful. Programmer pairs is an interesting idea to try (though I think it's taken too far in the book). There are much better books out there (e.g. Larman's OOA/D book; Fowler's UML book) - get them and leave this one on the bookstore's shelf!"
3,"Well, duh !","To summarize :A lot can be accomplished with a small hand-picked group of people who are emotionally stable, secure, honest, and communicate well who have a nice work environment, lots of feedback, and a diligent but benevolent boss.Well, ""duh!"" Under those conditions *anything* would work. The author pretty explicitly rules out most real life situations at the end of the book.If these principles of XP are a revelation to a manager, that manager is so far in the hole that they'd better stick with traditional management structures before they do real damage. Consultants can look for business restoring traditional structure to many groups in 2002 ....."
4,Not a band jam from the summer of 86,"I remember this from the summer of 1986. Pretty popular among the teeenagers at the time, but was overshadowed by Run DMC's ""Raising Hell."" This is almost as good as the first UTFO CD. Funny stories in ""Split Personality"" and ""Bad Luck Barry"". ""Kangol and Doc"" contains some really nice harmony as well as syncopated raps. The Educated Rapper is missing from this one, but his absence is not really felt. Overall, good old school rap that is sadly forgotten today."
3,Excellent effort,Altogether this is an excellent effort made by Chowdhary. The starting is owesome. I think at some places the author failed to convey the thought which was in his mind. Due to this sometime the reader gets bored and looses intrest. Also way too much mentioning of his native country which is not really a bad idea but it made the said topic irrelavant. I would say the Book returned 50% of what it was intended to do.
4,Bob's Red Mill Buckwheat Cereal,Bob's Red Mill Buckwheat Cereal is very healthy for you and also lower in calories than McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal which I appreciate.
2,As of 12/09 this is NOT Gluten-Free,"I contacted Bob's Red Mill by telephone after noticing that the packaging no longer shows Gluten Free. I was told the buckwheat is sourced from one company, and that enough contamination has started occuring that Bob's Red Mill Creamy Buckwheat can NO LONGER be considered Gluten-Free.The non-GF status is also listed in capital letters on Bob's Red Mill website.Very disappointing to me because I had grown to really appreciate the taste of this cereal--even more so than oatmeal."
4,A nice change from oatmeal,"The serving size is 1/4 cup which sounds a bit small, but after cooking you'll find a bowl full of creamy goodness. For my tastes, as I like things spicy, this cereal lends itself to plenty of pepper and hot sauce for a kicked up breakfast. Fresh fruit is a good option as well. I also add flax seed meal for added omega 3's. The Amazon subscription option is a no brainer....price discounts and free shipping! Delicious and nutritious."
3,Candian version,"This is not the english version. If you want the actuall Wrestlemania x-8 DVD, click on the item entitled ""Wrestlemania 18"". The one entitled ""Wrestlemania x-8 Icon vs. Icon"" is a candian version with french commentary."
4,"A sweet, nicely drawn St Pat's tale","We get our daughter a book about all the holidays that make up her cultural heritage and community. This is a beautiful book about St. Pat's day, but also about overcoming low expectations and self-empowerment -- but it's never preachy. My 3 yo daughter loves this book well after St. Pat's day, and we love to read it to her. Jann Brett has another winner! Although these illustrations lack the colorful details she's known for, the complexity of the mostly black/white drawings keep it engaging."
3,Realistic,"I bought this book because I was considering getting a Great Dane. I wanted to study up on the breed before committing to having one. It was good because it did bring up both good and bad things about the breed. Danes are not for everyone. However, I wish it would have had more info on everyday living with a Dane and not so much on breeding. And yes, I did get a Dane."
1,Bad TV plus poor customer service,"I definately would not buy this TV again. An entire column of pixels failed on the screen and I now have to live with a permanent verticle black line on my screen (panel). Of course this defect occured one month after the 1 year mfg. warranty ended! I contacted westinghouse customer support and they essentially said that I'm on my own. They suggested that I contact their authorized repair company in Denver ( I live in california) about repairs. The repair company said that Westinghouse will not supply new panels to be used for repairs (something about it's not cost effective for older models). I contacted westinghouse again and presented them with my dillema: for $700, I got a TV that went bad in 13 months. On one hand you won't repair the TV because the warranty has lapsed by one month. On the other hand I can't repair the TV becuase you no longer supply the the part (screen) I need. Needless to say, Westinghouse did nothing to help me out..."
2,Was great for four days....,"but on the fifth day, it started acting up. First many bars down the canter. After I unplugged it to try and re-boot it, I got ""only"" one bar. Talked to Best Buy, and they said ""it happens"", and that I was lucky it was w/in the 14-day exchange period. Lucky me. What will happen with the next one on day 15, I wonder?"
2,Really pretty tedious.,"NG manages to make even Beowulf and Sutton Hoo tiresome, and that takes some doing. The WWI battle scenes are endless; by halfway through, unless you have a serious fetish for old newsreel clips, you'll be shouting ""Yes, okay, WWI, I get it already!"" at the TV screen. Hardly anything about any of Tolkien's actual influences, and not enough footage from the movie to make it worthwhile. Not recommended."
1,"National Geographic own interpretation, not accurate","I do believe that NG has a great deal of experience in producing background information for our social-political-ecological problems, but the video ignores totally the fact that a world can be created out of sheer imagination.Anyone who is familiarized with J.R.R. Tolkien's life should know that his intention was to create a world of fantasy for children and adults as well. He specifically denied any relationship with actual real conflicts or characters of our history. Surely he is influenced by the nordic myths, traditions, legends and landscapes but if you get to read his own introduction to ""The Lord of the Rings"" you will find an aversion to the specific line of thinking used in the production by National Geografic.I do not recomend this product. It is educational but has nothing to do with the real background of J.R.R.T. and his idea of creating the longest story ever written."
1,Shameless Marketing,The marketer should be ashamed at the attempt to lure people to buy this DVD under the guise that it is the actual movie. I came very close to purchasing this film before I realized that this was not the movie but some commentary. I'm sure others fell for the poorly worded advertisement.
1,Pinnacle Embarrassment to User Community,Potential buyer beware. After several support calls to Pinnacle and hours of following their instructions this product will not even install. I have tried it on 3 different computers with the same results. I would highly recommend not purchasing this product or returning it to the store before you open the box. During the failed installs it also changes several of your registry keys and doesn't clean up after itself. There should be something lower than 1 star for this failed attempt at a product.
2,Crash and Burn!,"I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., 10.0, and this one. And they've all had two things in common:1. When the program works, it's superb.2. The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out. Studio Plus v10.5 is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price. At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice? Shop around. Google the competition. But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle."
1,Pinnacle,"I was not very satisfied with this product. I could not get the software installed, so I called tech support and they informed me to uninstall the software, and then reinstall it, but to uninstall it I would have to download a uninstall utility to do this. I did this and it wiped some of my Windows software out. I had the 10.6 version I think. I sent it back and asked for my money back. Amazon informed me they would, but have not received yet.My son came over and helped me with this program, but he could not get it to install either. He is a Computer Science graduate."
1,Downgrade from Studio 9!!,"Studio 9 worked but would occasionally crash. Thought I'd upgrade to 10.6. Installed the program, which took forever. Then installed the patch. Then installed the new driver. Now it will not show transition thumbnails, so it is like playing ""Concentration"" trying to remember which blank square holds which transition. Then, it refused to remove clips from the timeline, despite the fact that they were deleted from playback. It just made a frameshift, so that the timeline no longer matched playback. Then, it would not show any thumbnails in the timeline except those originally visible.Don't waste your money. I may re-install Studio 9 or just bite the bullet and learn to use the more difficult but more predictable interface of Premiere Elements. Studio 10 is a very disappointing product."
5,Aerosmith At Their Greatest...,"Many people rag on Aerosmith for ""selling out"" and not playing the music they started with. Their latest album Honkin' On Bobo was just that. A re-vamped version of their 70's style music. The album rocked and the tour was one of the greatest I have seen Aerosmith on. After seeing You Gotta Move on TV, it rocked. Defiantly one of the best Music DVD's I have seen in a long time. This is their first ""live"" Dvd since the 70's and they didn't miss a beat. They obviously play their old songs like it is the last time they are ever going to play them. Plus Aerosmith gets better each and every tour. This is a must have for any fan or anybody that has respect for real music as it will blow your mind."
3,talking or playing?,"Jeez, you would think that a band that kicks awesome butt live wouldn't talk over the beginnings of LOTS of songs on this DVD. We already have heard ad nauseum about how they broke up over drugs, got back together, blah, blah, blah. Do we have to hear them talk over the intros into songs, or worse, DURING a song (Draw The Line"")? I want to hear either or, not both. It REALLY is annoying. This could have been a great DVD. People buy in concert DVD's to hear and see the concert, not talking. Tons of other in concert DVD's have interviews with band members IN BETWEEN SONGS !"
5,"Great sound, exciting edits, hot girls . . . Rock on!","Yes this was an ultra-slick product but how many times have we bought concert DVD's that just didn't sound that good. The opening music on almost all music DVDs sounds great, but once the ""Play DVD"" button is pressed the sound oftentimes degenerates considerably. The sound on this DVD is superb! People complain about fast edits, but that's the way movies are made these days. People seem to like the Bourne movies, don't they? Fast edits are only annoying to me when they are done haphazardly. Not the case here. The band's energy permeates throughout. As does the audience's. And I love the hot stripper-type models in the front row. Rock on, boys!"
4,Excellent Printer,"I purchased a Lexmark All-In-One Printer-X5150. I also have a Dell A920 printer made by Lexmark. One thing people should know about Dell printer they have modified the original Lexmark so only Dell printer cartridges fit in it. That means you would have to buy ink cartridges directly from Dell. The X5150 is a much faster printer than the Dell. The quality of the printing is about the same. I have printer color pictures without any lines what so ever. The printing is clear, bright and outstanding. I highly recommend this printer it does a fine job and the software even talks to you. Two cons for the printer 1.The cost of the print cartridges is slightly high 2. No internal modem in the printer. To fax you have to use the modem in your computer. This isn't a real problem with the software that is included with the printer. Faxing is simple and a breeze."
2,Exegetical excess,"Mr. Bernasconi, in a far flung attempt to trace the problem of twentieth century racism to certain nineteenth century theological positions, has taken highly selective and controversial studies done in that century, in what appears to be a backhanded attempt under the guise of objective scholarly inquiry to paint with a broad brush the entire religious community of that era with a simplistic and in many cases unfair portrayal. He has unfortunately overreached himself in this endeavor, taking on a task fit for a more philosphically objective personality."
4,Mounting brackets.,"They worked perfect! I used the bracket as a template. It's not totally obvious, but I gave it some thought, put the bracket against the wall and drew my cut lines. The final product is very sturdy, functional and looks great."
4,works great,these brackets work great with double gang face plates when you need to install them in an existing wall and not a new construction. they didnt come with a pattern stensil however so my suggestion would be to start with a small hole and keep making it bigger until the bracket fits in the wall
5,awesome game,"This game is so realistic. You get to assemble your own strike team, select different weapons, and complete a number of very realistic missions. I found this game to be hours of fun. Once I started playing, I found it hard to stop. You'll love it if you love realistic action adventure games."
1,Not good.......,The controlability stincks. You die in one shot. And it gets boring without much of a story line.
4,"Blood, Gore, Action, RAINBOW SIX","Rainbow Six is a great game. If you don't like the blood you can turn it off in the main menu. The only thing wrong is that the controls are really hard to figure out. Once I figured out the controls I spent a whole day on it. It's really addictive. The best way to play is with ANALOG on and using the second control setting. You have a wide variety of guns, explosives, and uniforms."
2,Do not buy,"I bought this game probably 4 or 5 months ago. I wanted a game that was more of a military shooters type game. After reading the reviews and asking the clerk about the game I decided to purchase this game. The controls are way to difficult. If I am leading a team against terriosts, I do not have time to look at the manuel to determine what the X button was for again when I am in a dog fight with terrorist. I thought this game would be something like Syphon Filter. But this game does not even come close. But the one thing I did like about the game is the opening to this video game and the music. Only if they could have made the game for gamer friendly and have an option of first person shooter and third person shooter, this game would have been a great shooting game. I traded this game in for Madden 2001. I was very disappointed with how complicated the buttons were."
2,sounds better than it plays,"I heard nothing but good reviews about this game from friends, so I picked it up. With the exception of the 11th mission it was pretty basic & easy. It's done nothing new with the 1st person shooter scenario. Graphics are poor, movement is irratic, controls are difficult to use, and it only has 13 missions. You might as well just re-play a 1st person shooter that you already have rather than waste money on this product."
2,Good thought but bad implementation,"This game solves the flaw that you can send one man in to save the world (Syphon Filter, Metal Gear, etc.) The fact that you choose your team, their gear, their insertion points into the mission, what color gear they wear, etc. is great. If you want realism the planning part of the mission is fun. Unfortunately when the planning is over and the mission begins the trouble starts. It's awkward even moving let alone shooting a gun at a target. The worst thing is that you must normally press 2-3 buttons to do common tasks. Overall good realism and idea - but little attention to smooth gameplay like with Syphon Filter."
3,So you want to know about Rainbow Six?,"Ok lets get down to the facts, your a army dude trying to fight off bad guys to save some helpless hostages. It fun running around shooting peeps, i wouldnt say it's the greatest game but its great for a rainy dayGRAPHICS: GOODPLOT: GOODCONTROLS: HARDGame overall: Great Game to play and Have fun with!"
5,Frustrated Mulgrew fan from England.....,"I've been trying to get a copy of this video and another ""The Manions of America, staring Pierce Brosnan & Kate Mulgrew. But alas they seem only to sell it in US and Canadian formats, so I can't watch them over here. I guess I'll just have to settle for reading about how good they are........However if anyone can prove me wrong and know's where I can get a copy in UK format, I'd love to find out."
4,A Stranger is a Stranger No More,"With talents such as Kate Mulgrew and Rip Torn ""A Stranger is Watching"" is an intense thriller of kidnapping and ransom. Considered a ""slasher-flick"" by some critics, it is too benign by today's standards. This is a thriller that will allow its viewers to go to sleep at night, but it will make them wary of vans without windows."
4,Great Read,"If you are interested in this issue, I highly recommend the book. This book is extremely thorough, so thorough it could be used as a textbook on an astrobiology class. It was written in the sixties so yes its out of date here and there, but much of the information is surprisingly current. You also get a great early taste of Sagan's writing style."
5,STUNNING,Love this pillbox - I would like to purchase another of these in different colors - but forgot from whom I purchased it....brand new - and I love it...thank you to the seller
4,"Lovely outside, but a bit wonky on the inside","I love this pill case and use it frequently, because the cover is just so attractive. It's beautiful without being gaudy, especially as the design is done all in blues, silvers, and subtly shiny small stones.However, the plastic dish on the inside has given me frequent, recurring problems, because it has a tendency to pop up slightly and not stay attached to the bottom of the inside of the case. Eventually, with some investigation, I figured out that the adhesive substance under the plastic dish just didn't last very long, and so it had hardened or become less sticky or less elastic or something, and so the dish would pop up slightly and the case would -- as a result -- no longer close securely, and so was unusable. However, I simply replaced the adhesive with something else that stuck more securely, and now the case works perfectly fine."
2,Could be better,Cover not aligned to close properly. Pills keep falling out into my pocket. Sure looks nice but i think it was not worth it.
2,Well,It's a compilation of videos. Non 16x9. Standard stereo. It's good for a view. I bought it for King Diamond video and sold it promptly.Don't waste your time!
1,Inaccurate,"As A Catholic, I can tell you this is nonsense.Unfortunately this does not even get what Catholics really believe correct. I'm fine with my Christian brothers and sisters disagree with what I bleieve, but I certainly don't want them to be exposed to something that isn't what Catholics believe, and is completely inaccurate.If you wnat to know what a Catholic believes, I would suggest asking a knowledgable Catholic or checking out this book.http://www.amazon.com/Nuts-Bolts-Practical-Explaining-Defending/dp/0964261022/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1332796759&sr;=8-1God Bless. ""But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect."" (1 Peter 3:15)"
3,silliness abounds,"Fortunately for the viewer, Sammo Hung is able to just barely rescue this film from oblivion. His always interesting martial arts is the highlight of this piecs of fluff."
5,The best of its kind !,"Funny, exciting. This 1980 movie really changed the HK movie industry which up to that year had never combined horror with kungfu comedy. This movie spawned numerous imitations and the successful Mr. Vampire and Chinese Ghost Story series. Samo Hung still looks young and in a good shape really shines. The plot is about a man framed for murder of his wife because his wife has an affair with a rich man. The rich man hired a sorcerer to kill Samo Hung. Samo got helped by another sorcerer. The fight scenes are terrific and the DVD is quite good as well. Highly recommended. This movie along with the first Mr. Vampire are really the best of the genre. For you who never experienced HK horror, comedy, kungfu movie this is the one to start with."
5,Sammo at his Magical best!,"This film is one of the best Magical Kung Fu films I have ever seen, and let me tell you I have seen them all! From start to finish you will not be able to take you eyes off the screen as he takes you on a spooky adventure with quite stunning fight scenes, magical effects and very comical dialogue.A must buy for the open minded kung Fu loving viewer!"
3,The original in mysteries with one drawback,This is the first time I have read sherlock holmes and I do like the stories although some are very easy to figure out. The only sour point I have with these stories is that they were written in a racist era by a seemimgly very racist man which is quite sad.
5,sherlock Holmes,Always a surprise as you read how Holmes untangles a mystery. The old english writing is great and sometimes hard to follow but it is a charming way they said things back then. The suuspense leads up to a great ending.
4,Great Stories,"This is an excellent collection of the Holmes stories for an excellent price. Only criticism is that there are quite a few spelling errors, some format problems with some of the italicised text and two of the chapters with different titles and different stories have exactly the same starting section which I don't think Conan Doyle would have done. Apart from that was a most enjoyable read and a good addition to my collection."
2,Sherlock Holmes,"Really thought this would have been in better shape. The book is marked up and the jacket torn. I think that should be part of the description when trying to sell books, as I ordered this as a Christmas gift. I didn't expect it to be in the greatest shape, but in good shape as the description said."
5,The POD bible and then some,"Virtually any question you can think to ask about print-on-demand (POD) publishing, John F. Harnish has anticipated--and answered. His massive research over many months comes together in this uniquely useful book about the emerging technology and process of POD publishing. If you, like many thousands of other would-be published writers have concluded that you will grow old before the traditional publishers will agree to publish your work, you should consider doing it yourself. Harnish demystifies the process and debunks the notion that this technology is nothing more that dressed up vanity publishing. No POD is much much more than that. It's more rewarding, more legitimate, more promising, and more lucrative. Think I'm wrong? Invest in this book and see for yourself. This is the most useful book you can have to launch your writing career--if you're serious about it."
4,nice light,"I use the light on my stand in a poorly lit sanctuary. Works fairly well, and doesn't interfere with page turning. Looks a little silly, and could double for antenna in a Halloween costume."
4,almost perfect,"Great design, just wish it were brighter. It is the best thing available for lighting music on a wire stand I've found."
3,Mighty Bright Duet Music Stand Light,"I was somewhat disappointed that this light wasn't brighter. I like the way it clips to the stand and has duel lights, but they aren't bright enough for playing at night outdoors. They were better than no lights, but disappointing. Maybe a bigger bulb would help."
3,A light...but no cigar.,"A friend who owns a studio got several of these and said they worked great. I also used them at the studio and thought they would work in my booth at home (I'm a voiceover talent). I have a small booth (4x4) and a normal reading light actually throws off a lot of heat. I purchased two. First off I found that while it claims to have 2 settings, only one worked. Fortunately, it was the brighter one so it does the trick. Having one switch for both would be a help, but it's a small thing. I have used the second unit for book reading, and it seems one light is concentrated and brighter, while the other scatters the light and is not nearly so bright. So...two bought, both only had one setting, and frankly I would like a bit more brightness to really be a value. It beats the tar out of a RocketFish I purchased previously, but needs improvement."
5,Avril's baaack!,"i highly recommend this CD to anyone who liked her first one...personally i think it's miles better than Let Go, because I can relate to it more.. this cd is awesome. The songs are deeper and not so focused on relationships..The last song Slipped Away, for example is dedicated to her grandfather. The guitar is harder, but some of her vocals could be nastier. All in all, this was a very well written album and props to Avril. I don't think she'll be leaving the music scene anytime soon..."
1,A good album if you're a 10 yr old,otherwise wait for avril to grow up and buy something more mature and meaningful
1,No.,"I believe that in this day and age, the term ""genius"" is being used far too loosely. Since when did this apply to a would-be-McDonalds worker, whose greatest artistic acheivement is breaking the record for the thickest makeup ever worn, and the baggiest clothing? I am appauled. I haven't even touched on the ""music"" yet.The ""music""? Well, if you believe that many painful minutes of jangly acoustic guitars, combined with simple rhyme patterns, combined with bitter lyrics about how ""I've been mistreated by boys"" is genius, well than maybe YOU need to take a look in the mirror, and ask yourself...WHY? Is it because I""M even dumber than my idol?""Rock on!"" ""DDDUUUUHHHH!"""
2,2.5 Actually,"Avril has only gone up a half a notch since last time and that's only because she's getting to the part where she writes/co-writes most of her songs, on the second album, instead of on the third or fourth. She's learning that it takes more than flashy studio work and having two older guys pen the songs to make a good album.Still, even though her lyrics are more personal, the music doesn't really appeal to me; though it is slightly less annoying than on ""Let Go"". If you didn't like that album, I'd suggest this one instead and maybe she'll keep learning as time goes buy and turn into a decent artist someday.One can only hope."
1,Wow..this is called Music?,Its sad because some people thinks this is music. This is the biggest load of so called music ever. Punk sucks. It died before it even started. This CD is not even worth throwing at your friends to make them bleed. Don't buy it..not worth it.
1,"All hype, no talent","Ah, Avril Lavigne. There is no better example of how bad popular cuture has become in the 21st century than Avril Lavigne. 10 years ago, or maybe even only 5 years ago, Avril Lavigne would have been handed a bar of soap, a washcloth, and some prozac, then laughed off the stage. Today she is a ""rock star"". The fact that this CD has sold 6 million copies is meaningless. Big record sales don't prove that a performer has musical talent. All they prove is that people will buy anything if it is hyped and marketed enough. If you want to be Lemming #6,000,001, than by all means, go ahead and buy this sensationalized piece of garbage. Keep following the flock you bratty little sheep of the burbs. This is the freaking truth."
3,Avril - Alanis,"Like Alanis Morisette? Then you'll like Avril Lavigne. She's a Alanis wannabe(which theres nothing wrong with). But unlike Alanis she gets very annoying after you've had her Cd for awhile and hear My Happy Ending frequently on the radio and the lyrics are in peoples profiles for AIM. Now that Avril's Cd has been out for a while and the songs are played rarely i can finally start listening to her Cd again.Now, comparing to her old Cd, she's totally different. Hersongs have matured and her songs are a lot more Rock than rock pop. So if you think you can handle all the things i've said then buy this Cd, but if you can not then leave it alone."
1,crazy and bad yehhaaa,this girl is so crazy and bad I want to be like her her songs make me sad and happy at the same time is like i can handle the world and give a punch to it oh god it feel so good she is so sk8er and bad.Totally crazy. JAJAJAJAAJAJAJAJAJA THIS ALBUM SUCK YOU LITTLE GIRLS WHO HEARD IT MAJOR SUCK PRODUCTION SHE IS JUST A POSER AND WANNABE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT
4,I just can't get the songs out of my head,"This album is generally far better than 'Let Go' cos all the songs are equally so much nicer than those previous ones. Wanna highlight two generic songs 'Don't Tell me' and 'Happy Ending', they are really really 2 of the best songs I've ever heard. Thank u Avril for bringing us such a well-explained emotion out this album.Besides, 'How Does It Feel' is stunning, too. Don't you guyz think the ending part can only be performed by Avril with her unique voice and she's been shouting out loud just great to touch everybody's heart.Hope to see her third single coming out as this song and I wonder what the video would look like. She's too cool to resist."
1,Overrated,"This album is really mediocre. A lot of the lyrics, vocals, and composition are laughable. ""Let Go"" was MUCH better, you're better off buying that. The loss of the Matrix producers is definitely apparent on this album. Lots of bad songs and just a big disappointment overall."
5,"Finally, Some Talent!","Avril Lavigne, though not the absolute cleanest of singers, may be what music lovers have been wanting. Her voice isn't doctored, it's the real thing. She writes her own songs, and plays them on her guitar (She can play piano, too). I can't say enough about how much talent she has!This CD is made up of hard rock songs, slow songs, and more upbeat pop songs. The perfect mix, if you ask me. My favorite songs are ""Don't Tell Me"", ""My Happy Ending"", ""Forgotten"", and ""Freak Out"". You may find others that you enjoy on this album, though. Avril has really changed, and for the better, in Under My Skin, which truly talks about Avril, and all the things on her mind.I recommend this album to any rock music lover, any Avril Lavigne fan, and anyone who's sick of cheesy pop! Go, Avril!(...)"
5,Love ya,This Canda person can sure rock harder than any person. Her songs are from herself. Nothing can put a stop to that. My favorite song is Nobodys Home. And Slipped Away. All her videos are very good. Nobodys Home is very sad. I never knew Avril went through stuff like that Enjoy this cd for yourself
5,Avril Lavigne Rocks Again,"Avril did it again; she brought out another new CD that will take her to the top.Her music skills are the best, how many other female singers write their own music to every song and then play a musical instrument,Avril is so talented and her voice makes her music what it is.This CD is surely the best CD to buy today, I recommend this CD to everyone to buy.You won't regret it.Avril as you say in your song ""Don't Tell Me"" get out of my way or I'll have to kick your #_ _ and make you never forget.You kick #_ _ anyways.Keep doing what you are doing, cause you are awesome."
5,Avril Is DaBOMB!,"I loved Avril since I heard her first album ""Let Go"". She is different, has a great voice, and an excellent sense of individuality. My favorites from her first album were: I'm With You, Anything but Ordinary, Losing Grip, Tomorrow, and Complicated. I have been waiting for ""Under My Skin"" for a while now and got it a few days ago. It is a lot darker and deeper than her first album but I still like it. Esp. Take me Away, My Happy Ending, Together, Nobody's Home, and Fall to Pieces. I think the lyrics are easy to relate too, and listening to Avril provides me with a sense of calmness. I love Avril Lavigne, she is truly the BEST! =)"
5,Avril's Back!,"I've waited for avrils second album for ages and when it finally came out i bought it straight away. Its different from thwe first album. its a lot more grown up and you can relate to the songs. It includes a bonus track in the uk and it is great. the guitar in the album is great and it is perfect for air guitar (!!!!!)great album avril, can't wait 4 the next!"
1,......,"First off, I never ever EVER want to hear ANY avril song referred to as punk. This girl is as poppy and fake as all the people she critisizes. If you do think this is punk then you plain and simple have never heard punk. Avrils songwriting hasn't ""grown"" or ""matured."" The few songs she actually writes are still the same old stuff from the last cd. Its rediculous that this girl sells any records period. It proves single-handedly that all record companies do these days is snatch up someone with a little talent, give them a whole new band, and throw 14 songs their way. Then they leave it to MTV to shove it down peoples throats and they start buying the cds. Music is sad these days and people like avril lavigne are the reason why."
2,avril no longer an idol,u noe i used 2 like avril b/c she proved that u didn't have 2 use sex 2 get attention. but this album is dissapointing she wore mak-up in her videos. and then i heard her sing live and was like wats up with her voice. i also heard her voice in her 1st album and it was alanis morsitte. its also dissapointing because this album songs are about the same thing w/ the exception of don't tell me. and she says its a rock album and its so not a rock album its a alternate rock/ pop album
1,Such a hypocrite,"Its so sad that this girl sells albums. Really, think about it. She claims to be the ""anti-Britney"" or whatever, yet writes songs that are just as poppy, and basically aimed at the same audience. She isn't ""punk""...she's corporate pop, and poor pop at that. If you want to hear decent pop music, listen to something like U2, or even No Doubt...at least they are good songwriters, with music that will stand the test of time."
3,Actually Not Bad,"I have to say I was indeed a little surprised by Avril's sophomore album. I've never been an outright fan of Avril's, but I think 'Under My Skin' is quite an improvement from the first; 'Let Go' was all about reinforcing the image of an underage punk girl filled with angst and horomones. 'Skin' rounds out Avril's personality, proving she does have something more to sing about than skater boys. ""Slipped Away,"" the last track, in my opinion is the standout track. It's not as bad as Izzy would have you believe. If it were an option, I would give 3 & 3/4 stars"
1,Avril Lavigne...a great talent and sexy too!,"Avril Lavigne is a wonderfully sophisticated, erudite lady of the old school whose continental charms and gentle, poignent lyrics (especially those aboout kicking her boyfriend's @$$) add so much musically, culturally, and morally to our civilisation. Furthermore, she's also incredibly sexy, sort of in a supermodel like way don't you think? What a romantic...so lovely and ladylike. Classically beautiful: move over Cindy Crawford, get lost Christy Turlington, forget it Linda Evangilista! Here's a REAL babe of a woman...Avril! A real charmer! Hey, has she beaten anybody this week?"
1,The worse music...Ever ?!,"Yes. Avril Lavigne is by far the worse music to ever be created and also ? She cannot sing to save her pathetic loser life. Whats so appealing about a stupid,nerdy,skinng,ugly,white girl ?Another thing...She looks sick too. Mtv is the worse music channel ever and dont know good music if it was fed to them.Avril lavigne's ""under my skin"" is a waste of plastic in every sentence of the word. Dont support trash."
1,what a pen0r!,"i hope this whiny bich gets taught a lesson by some TROO punk musicians sometime! justin sane from anti-flag could kic her ass any time of the day. please let her get an STD and leave real punk people alone, the whor. i hope she gets a kick in the ovaris at least so she cant have kids and spread her bich jenes all over the world! she's a whor!"
1,No. Just...no. Its horrible.,"Ok, I didn't listen to the whole album. I didn't even buy it. Why? Cause I knew if I did, it would be a waste of my money. I heard ""Don't Tell Me"" a million times on MTV cause thats what MTV does: they replay everything till you go insane. I thought it sucked. Then when the album came out I heard it was harder music than first album. So, I downloaded ""He Wasn't"". Bad idea. Avril's vocals are horrible. Her voice is annoying. She's also a horrible writer...thats if she even WRITES her own music.I hate it. I knew that if I heard only one song from the album and I hated it...I would hate the rest of the album too."
1,OMFG HOW THE HELL DID THIS GET LABELED 'PUNK'?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"i know i migh tcrush some dumbass 10 year olds heart when i say THIS IS NOT PUNK DAMMIT! real punk is the Clash, the Ramones, not this pile of sh|t. i probably wouldn't be ranting and raving if she would simply stop being a mojor poser. dont waste your money on this and check out some good REAL punk bands such as: Anti-flag, Bad Religion, Jello Biafra, NOFX, Rise Against, Social Distortion or, hell, maybe even Greenday (finally went punkish) please listen to me. im done ranting"
5,My Happy Ending,"The best song on this CD is My Happy Ending. Here's a little partof it...And all of the memories so close to meJust fade awayAll this time you were pretendingSo Much for my happy ending!... It was the best part in the song.Avril Lavigne is the best. To see an animation about the song,go to:http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view.php?id=205029=) Enjoy! ( I didn't make it, but it's good, anyway )"
2,Good production but...,"The only reason I know of this CD is because my little sister bought it and left it in my CD player, so really I listened to it by mistake. Anyways...Avril Lavigne took over the writing of the songs, and really she isn't that great of a lyricist. While you're listening to these songs you can guess what she's gonna say next. It usually goes like ""something something thoughts inside my head / I regret all those things I said"" and so on. The most ""unique"" thing she says is ""get off of my bed"" which is supposedly rebellious for a girl her age.The production is well done for her style though. I find it boring and it gets old through one listen.Overall I guess this is something my little sister could enjoy but anybody who isn't 10 years old and says she is a mature, experienced lyricist is just ignorant."
1,Avril a Genius??? She wishes!,"Avril should really go into a ditch and just stay there. She comes across all tuff and ""bad ass"" but really she jusr does what the record execs tell her to do. IF Brody of the Distillers and Avril were to fight. Brody would take avril down in a second. No doubt about it. And she has no lyrical talents."
5,Go Avril!,"I thought she was an amzing artist when she came out with 'Let Go'... she has out-done herself! Every song on this album songs like it belongs, it makes a perfect mix! Every song is written well and easy to sing along to. Mature lyrics like 'Nobody's Home' and 'Fall to pieces' make this cd amaing... it still has its chatchy Hits...."" My Happy Ending"" and ""Freak Out"". I have soo much respect for this girl!! She proves that a girl can be B E A U T I F U L without being a skank! Go Avril! You really are all grown up! I love you! Keep Rocking with GOOD CHARLOTTE, baby! haha Im done."
1,More useless music from the music industry's biggest poser.,"Avril's first album was horrible enough. Poppy ballads claiming to be coming from a ""hardcore punk rocker"" (and by the way,did I never saw Joey Ramone, Kurt Cobain, or Matt Skiba on the cover of Teen People?...No.) These lyrics or tunes are no less pop than Brittney or Christina. In fact I think i can handle those two better than Avril. At least they are not pretending to be ""Hard Rockers"". But ,anyway, for the review part...it's a horrible Cd filled with pop ballads written by a bunch of 40 year old fat man, it's Avril's voice put through a bunch of machines to make it sound better, and has her face on the cover. All you need to know. Go find someone better. WAIT, THERE IS NO GOOD MUSIC TODAY! I guess you guys are screwed."
1,lets just say avril sucks,okay...so i have never liked avril at all..not one tincy bit...but i decided to give her another chance. i borrowed her new album from a friend...and the verdict is..she still sucks. her lyrics are about boys and stupid little people..and she still can't sing or play the guitar. she is just a sad poser.
2,"Got ""Under My Skin"" with this...","The only song I really thought was worth listening to on this cd, was the smash hit from the radio ""Don't Tell Me"". Otherwise I thought it was a waste of $12. Definetly not as good as the first cd, I was very disappointed as I am a big Avril fan! Goes to prove the first ones are always the best!!"
4,A Solid Sophomore Effort,"I am sure most of the people who wrote the review that hate this album didn't even went through listen the whole album, my be just couple of radio hits. And some people here are just personal attack rather just don't like the music. Okay..Honestly, This album compare to ""Let Go"", I have to say the tune is not as popish and catchy as the first one, but i still think some of the songs is rather melodic, i never thought her music is anywhere near punk, maybe just her image gave people the impression. This album compare to the first one, is a bit more angry, the selection of music is more mature, is it worth a listen? YES. Definitely an above average sophomore effort for a young pop singer.P.S. Bad Music? Go to buy the William Hung album and listen to it, his ""I Believe I Can Fly"" still couldn't get out from my head.."
1,One song out of twelve.,"In this album, there is only one song out of all twelve of them which I actually like (""Take Me Away""). I like that one, and actually listen to it. The rest of them?... uh. Rather listen to Hounds of Love, thanks.Some of them are just ""blah"". Others are downright unlistenable."
1,BEWARE IT SUX!!!,"this CD i a very bad waste of money i cant believe this album it is sooooooo bad. But if you want to here some good music listen 2 GOOD CHARLOTTE, SIMPLE PLAN, SUGARCULT, MEST, BLINK 182, or NEW FOUND GLORY!!!!!!!! rawk on yall!!From MEPS avril is a poser!!!!!!"
1,.............................,i love let go....but not this albumher vocal is extremely WEAKespecically in the first 2 tracksi regret that i made a decision on buying this album
5,THE SIREN SINGS,"Walk This World with Heather Nova! Heather's 2nd US release is a collection of music and lyrics that touch the soul. The sound of ""London Rain"" captures the feeling of this CD. From the warming ""Heart And Shoulder"" and the rocking ""I'm The Girl"" the dreaminess of ""Widescreen"" and ""Avalanche"" to the hauntingly moving ""Winterblue"" Heather captures many a multitude of emotion in her music and words. She has evolved into one of the premier singer/songwriters in music today. She is definitely a star in her own right."
4,One of the funnest albums of the year,"I took a chance in purchasing this album - I'd only heard one track on NPR a few weeks ago. It had a great, understated head-bopping groove that stayed with me. I like world music when it isn't over-produced or over-synthesized, and the track I heard (Limon En La Cabeza) had just the right feel.I just got done listening to the whole album, and I was really impressed - score! Every track has that same understated groove. It has a popular, hip sound, but doesn't go over the top or veer into Ricky Martin territory.Gecko Turner has a great voice and delivery, and each song seamlessly incorporates 70's funk guitars, reggae beats, bebop horns, toe-tapping percussion and an overall attitude that gets your body movin'.If you're looking for some fun music that won't rot your teeth but keeps your booty shakin', and keeps you engaged with its inventive sound, do yourself a favor and get this album!"
1,Useful to hold up an air-conditioner,"This book is really disappointing. While it looks massive, and weighs a ton, MUSIC HOUND's WORLD is missing so many essential figures. Look at Brazil, they have a section on DAUDE (a relatively minor artist), but have NOTHING on giants of Samba such as PAULINHO DA VIOLA and MARTINHO DA VILA. ANNA VISSI (Greece), VLADIMIR VYSOTSKY (Russia), and countless others are omitted, while an equal number of bizarre names such as VINX are here. They seem more interested in people like Linda Ronstadt and Shakira's contribution to world music that actually putting together a guide about the movers and shakers. Even the bios that they do feature are for the most part, re-hashed press releases. This guide is useless, and a waste of paper."
4,Minstrel Ben Tankard,"I received this Cd in Great Condition, No Skipping,Scratches on the CD when playing it. The songs are wonderfulI would recommend to purchase again. I Love This Artist and enjoy his music when I play this CD. I will enjoy it over and over and listing to all the instruments loud and clear. I am a satisfied customer!"
4,Witches of Worm,What to know what a witches cat is like? Read the Witches of Worm. It is about a girl who finds a cat and it changes her life
3,An entertaining but 'one-note' story,"I found this book to be entertaining, and it was a very quick read. I thought the mix of the semi-supernatural elements in with mainly realistic fiction elements made for a good story. The writing was pretty strong as well. However, I thought the story lacked depth...it just seemed a little 'one-note' to me. I also had a hard time deciding whether I liked the main character or not. I wavered back and forth (nearly through the whole book!) between feeling slightly sorry for her and feeling disdain for her actions--ended up feeling mildly sympathetic towards her in the end. Overall though, I did like this Newbery Honor book, but it will definitely not be included in my top picks for children's novels."
3,"good, but not perfect replica of a classic book","one of the first and most important books to influence European and US architecture by detailed drawings of ancient Greek temples and buildings in the 18th centuryalso lots of perfect drawings of statues, reliefs, pillars and capitalswording not really perfectly reprinted - quality of typing partly of lesser quality; drawings are perfectworth to have and to look at if ancient Greece or history or the development of architecture are of interest"
5,Great deal for 2009....,"The previous reviews below on Amazon were written in 2005/2006. Sirius is now running clearance on this radio/speakers for a very low price. I just got my S50 w/executive speakers and both items far exceeded my expectations. The speakers are not 'tinny' in the slightest; in fact, they are full and strong. The player is light and easy to use. And the music is the best part. If you are new to satellite radio, this is a great product to buy (especially at the current prices!)"
4,Innovation,Madan Birla successfully described the innovation and the role of the employee at the company's performance by giving real life examples from the history of FedEx.
3,"Slow, but interesting","I recently read the novel named ""I, Juan de Pareja"" and found it to be very, very slow but interesting. This might seem like a contradiction, but there was no real action in the book and it also provoked a lot of thought in my mind. However, it seemed like the thought lingered in my mind for a fleeting moment and then went down slowly along with all the other words in the book. I do recommend this book who wants to sit down and read a long, slow book but not to someone who wants to be thrilled and excitied."
2,Comprehensive but Basic & Boring,"A good book for beginners, but not for anyone with at least a few months of marketing experience. All chapters have good summaries and occasional case studies. I've been doing marketing for about 2 years and find some of the general strategies helpful. For example, he advises using call-to-action strategies, but doesn't go into details about the tricks of the implementation. Also, the first chapter on direct marketing is excellent in that it ties in well conceptually with internet marketing. Overall, I would say not worth your time if you're a professional, skim it if you've had some experience, and a good buy if you're an absolute beginner."
4,Very practical and up-to-date (1999),"Barry Silverstein gives practical and proven tips and tricks of the online direct marketing trade in combination with usefull business cases. The first two chapters are a bit basic, but you may skip them if you know it allready. You can read the book randomly and search for topics of interest. I enjoyed it a very much and found only two drawbacks: It is all Americain (examples and reference sites) and there is not much figure material to back up the theories.To conclude: If you're a marketing professional and want to have full use of the internet this is an eye opener!"
4,Good condition as promised,Preston's quote acrostics are becoming scarce. It was good to find one that had not been filled in.
2,Less-than-first-rate Vidal,"Gore Vidal is a national treasure and one of my favorite authors, but this is the most disappointing of his novels that I have read. The first hundred pages or so consist of Washington cocktail-party chatter circa 1940, and it doesn't get much better as it goes along. The characters seem oddly detached from the epochal events unfolding around them, and as a result the reader cares little about them. There is much to be said about the machinations of the ruling powers during the period covered in this book; perhaps a work of fiction, although based on fact, is not the proper forum to explore them, as master essayist Vidal must himself have known before finishing this dramatically unsatisfying work. Perhaps he needed the advance to pay the mortgage on his Italian villa? Authors have to eat, too."
2,...,"If the General Lee was this hard to drive in the show life Bo and Luke deserve a medal. I could not control the general at all, and Rosco kept running me off the road. This is only fun if you like destruction derbys not racing."
2,Poorly written,I got a used one so don't feel that bad. The explanation and the code samples are very poor. I would not recommend buying this one.
1,Terrible,"I've read the first 4 chapters twice and started reading part of chapter 5 before I gave up. The writing style is terrible. Do not get this book if you are a total beginner to ASP. Actually, do not even get this book at all. I have taken classes in C++, VB, and Java and it was still difficult for me to follow this book. The author goes into some really unnecessary details and there are many lines of code that he should not even be mentioning in this type of book. Lastly, this book was written with a pre-release version of Visual Studio .NET, so you'll just confuse yourself more. I wanted to learn how to build a web-based database application and figured that using ASP.NET would be the way to go. I think I'll try a book on PHP and MySQL next."
1,Worst textbook I've used..,"This textbook is really bad. Not very informative at all comparing it to other financial accounting books. It gives very broad descriptions and definitions that make it feel more like a grammar school book than a college-level. I was very unhappy that my professor assigned my class with this book. If you do not need to buy it, please don't, it's horrible."
4,Hot!,"Yes, this is obviously the technology that led to the internal combustion engine and vapor carburetor. Gives good light and is better made the Vermont offerings, I also ordered a gimbal for the sailboat. Really, everything! gets hot and takes 20 minutes to cool down so make sure you have enough fuel in the tank for the evening so as not to break the mood by turning on the ol' lights to refill. I can't recommend this however, the fuel is expensive, so is the lamp and when these were developed Light Emitting Diodes did not exist. So ask yourself if you want an oil lamp, or illumination. My 3xAAA headlamp is brighter and safer to handle."
4,Review for Eforcity Customer service,This review is mainly for the Eforcity customer service. I placed an order and got the item in a timely manner but apparently i got a lemon as the battery died out on me rather quickly (wont hold a charge). I contacted Eforcity for a return and replacement. They responded promptly and arranged for the replacement right away. I hope every seller on amazon would be as efficient as these guys.------The replacement battery still works ----- so far.
5,Great Battery,"I was thinking .99 for a battery..OK I'll give it a try. I ordered 3 hoping I would get one good one, but all 3 worked great!!! I charged them up put one in the camera and went to the Zoo (I took a extra one with me just in case) The battery lasted all day..Never had to use my back-up. just as good as the Canon battery and only .99 Can't beat the price!!!!"
1,absolutely useless,"I bought two of these, having not learned my lesson in the past with OEM cheap batteries. Brand new, out of the box, they don't hold a charge for 30 minutes. Two more things bound for the trash - I'm going to buy a Canon one right now."
5,Definitely Worth the Money!!,"I was leaving in a few weeks for a cruise, and I almost paid full price for a Canon battery. I needed a back up battery because I was going to be off the ship for 8 hours at a time. I finally decided to buy 3 of these, just in case they were garbage, and if 1 or more could not hold a charge.To my surprise, they worked just as well as my Canon battery! I've charged them many times since, and they hold a charge just as long as my Canon battery ever did. I was very impressed. I use my camera all the time, and I highly recommend these batteries.I didn't write my review for about 6 months after I had bought them, because I wanted to give them the true test of time. They passed, and are all still working great to this day!I hope this helps!"
5,"Works great, super price!","I'm extremely happy with this battery. I've had no problems with it, and it keeps its charge just as well as the Canon battery would. Great price and fast shipping, too."
4,Delightful series,The relationships between the main characters begin to deepen as Captain Lacey tackles the murder of a second-rate actress. Gardner will keep you guessing.
3,For Die Hard Cure Fans Only,This is an interesting look at the early days of The Cure. This recording of an 18 year old Robert Smith may sound different to later Cure fans but it gives you an idea of how their music evolved from a garage band to a goth supergroup
4,"The FIRST, The Original.","I hate to say it, but I'm old enough to recall searching racks and racks of vinyl albums for this one!This album was The Cure's first. (Their Peel session EP doesn't contain enough tracks to make it a real album....but it has a fantastic version of Boys Don't Cry.) Any semi-serious Cure fan will quickly realize that most of the tracks on ""Three Imaginary Boys"" made it onto their U.S. Debut album: ""Boys Don't Cry"".While moody and quirky, this album is not a showcase for The Cure. This early work shows Robert Smith's attempts at defining a sound for the group before they knew what they were doing. Its heavy Punk influence overshadows the dark and sad mood of the words of most of the songs.This album does contain a few gems like Meathook, Plastic Passion, and 10:15 Saturday Night, and it MUST be part of any Cure fan's collection... but if you like the layered, synth-heavy tones of ""Disintegration"", or the angry and loud ""Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me"", then this one is NOT for you."
5,An artist who loves his subject,"This small-format lavishly-illustrated book accomplishes everything it attempts. The posters are reproduced nicely, although in postcard size. To readers with questions about the actual canine work of a race, this book explains quite a lot. Siberian huskies are the stars of ""the last great race,"" and there are many modern-day improvements to their lot - food-warmers, airlifted straw drops (for their sleeping comfort) and more. The Van Zyles' dogs are varied and gorgeous. Jon Van Zyle is a handsome bearded man who appears - with great success - in some of the posters. Jona Van Zyle offers a wealth of information. The drawings are romantic and even heroic - without being kitschy. For example, the piercing blue eyes of a Siberian husky are actually hauntingly beautiful in real life - and a Van Zyle painting might confirms that. A great look at beautiful, hardworking dogs by two people who love them."
5,Another wonderful book by Jean Marzollo,"We love Jean Marzollo's books, and this one is a favorite of my son (two years old). He loves to hear the rhymes and follow the rhythym of the book, as well as watch the eggs turn into birds.Thumbs up. :)"
3,A book for total change and mind purification.,"I came to know about this book from my brother, who is in India having good number of books. Last month I have booked a copy through my book shop and I got it three days before. I have read it and my experience is beautiful. We have five friends here doing meditation and collecting good books and we have a web site too. What I felt during the reading [small stone in the good food ] was repeated ` I `. May be because of my thinking that we have to reduce using 'I'. Otherwise direct talking style and other details are fantastic. We pray for Dr.Wayne W.Dyer to think more positively and write more good books. No writer will be satisfied with his works till he can think. He always thinks that NEXT will be the best. With the help of Dr Wayne and others the world will become heaven. No war No fight! With LOVE, EM Hashim"
4,"It was decent but lacked real ""futuristic"" action","It was decent but lacked real ""futuristic"" action. It was not very detaled but an interesting read. P.S. This is not from a Star Wars Hater's"" point of view!"
2,"Good Idea, bad follow-through","K.W. Jeters did have a good idea when he thought of making a story in which Boba Fett was the main character. That being said, may I say that that was all that was good about it. First of all, it is inconsistant with the Star Wars Universe, most prominently Tales of the Bounty Hunters and Tales of Jabba's Palace. Zuckuss is not a sniveling wimp, but a cool and composed bounty hunter, and NOT a member of the guild. His partner, 4-LOM, is nowhere to be found either. Bossk, also is NOT a member of the guild, mush less the son of its leader. He is not a spoiled brat, but also a cool, composed bounty hunter with all the moves. IG-88 did not even exist during that period, so I won't go there. The Dengar plot had no point that I could determine, and was not a large part of the book. Lastly, this was a pointless book with a few badly-executed ideas."
4,i think this book was very good,i think that anyone who loves the star wars books should read it the only problem with this book is that they dont tell you more about some of the main characters
2,Not a very good book,"I gave this book ""Two Stars"" because I have reserved ""One Star"" for the even worse ""Slave Ship"" (and ""Splinter of the Mind's Eye"", should I ever review that)There are some interesting parts in the book. I liked the spider being and the parts with Dengar, but on the whole, I found myself saying every few pages, ""Has this author ever read any of the other books? Doesn't he know that.... (fill in what ever inconsistency I had just read)?"" The plot was lame, the characters better suited for a comic book, and the inconsistencies with the rest of the SWU just too much to overlook. Read this book only if you are determined to read EVERY Star Wars book (and if you managed to read Dark Saber and Crystal Star, you'll make it thru this one)"
3,"A good read, made even better if your a Boba Fett fan","A book worth reading if you are a Star Wars or Boba Fett fan, I do say it could have been better, but overall, not bad."
3,"interesting, yet disappointing","I was very excited when I saw the book in the store. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and am always on the lookout for more Star Wars books (I have 33, and have read 36). But this one probably has one of the worst storylines I have encountered so far. What's with the ""then"" and ""now"" thing? Have you forgotten that Star Wars happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away? Duh!!!! Also, they made Zuckuss into a wimp, 4-LOM wasn't there, and didn't you forget about his injuries!! And remember, Mr. Jeter, that Dengar had that super-human strength. I hate to be repititive, but, duh!! Oh, yeah, would you please stop saying ""barve"". I can practically hear that word in my sleep, and I am sick of it. And PLEASE tell us who Neelah is, would you!! But, overall, it had a lot of good points, and, like all other Star Wars books, I got lost in it, and that, plus the fact that I love Star Wars, is good enough for me."
1,bait and switch,"At last the story of Bobba Fett, well not quite! I was looking forward to reading a great SW story about the most enigmatic character from the movies and what did I get? A warmed over plot about Tertiary characters, and the main character is unconscieous for half the book! My biggest gripe is that we are not even treated to the slightest history about the famed armor. Come on, it's the title of the book. I am sorry Jeter decided to phone this one in. And finally, I hate stories that jump back and forth in time every chapter, a plot mechanism best reserved for 3 out of every 4 star trek books."
3,It Could've been better.,"To date I have read and ENJOYED every one of the Star Wars novels and so far this is the only one I wasn't impressed with. The correlation w/ the characters in the other books (especially from Tales of the Bounty Hunters) was good as it is in most Star Wars novels, but it didn't make up for the overall DRAG that prevailed. I would still recomend it to anyone who reads the SW novels for the simple correlation to the other books. I also gave it a rating of 3 stars for the simple reason that it's Star Wars (every other one I would give a 4.5 to 5). On a different note, the X-Wing series and the trilogy written by Timothy Zahn (Heir to the Empire, The Last Command, Etc.) are wonderful."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this movie. I'm not used to seeing John Schneider playing that type of role. Movie makes no sense, and even the acting wasn't that great. I only bought it because John Schneider was in it. The role he played was not one I enjoyed seeing him play."
1,One of worst horror movies ever?,"This movie was horrible! I dont even know where to begain, The plot was sloppy and hard to follow, the acting was some of the worst i have ever scene in a movie, the ogre was very unrealistic and cheesy and the movie had too many in movie errors to count(Me and my friend kept noticing them and pointing them out even though we hardly paying attention to the movie after awhile)(EX: For some reason In different parts of the movie characters would randomly reappear in the town that were killed by the oger earlier)Overall id stay far away from this film if ur looking for something thrilling and good."
3,Not Exactly What I Expected.,The format isn't exactly what I hoped for. I couldn't find any of the half dozen items that I have.
1,Appalling Story REINFORCES bad behavior,"We purchased this story for our two-year-old on recommendation from a book list, and are appalled at the tact it takes in addressing the issue of sharing. There is not one positive example of sharing in the whole book! Instead, children are taught that ""sharing"" peas means shooting them at your siblings, and ""sharing"" toys means feeding your sister's teddy bear to the dog. If such behavior was shown to be corrupt at the end, one could possibly justify the story for some age groups. But alas, the best we get are two siblings ""sharing"" chicken pox because they played too closely. Don't buy this book for your kids, it sends an incredibly negative message."
5,"Great product, great service!","I was very pleased with my purchase through this company. The chain is beautiful, it was packaged nicely and arrived at my door in no time!"
2,did not work for me,I was hoping this product was more liquid. It is more like trying to use a crayon to cover the gray and was not very effective for me.
3,A TURN FOR THE UNEXPECTED !!!,"O this their 3rd studio lp,the band goes funk-dance oriented,so don't expect to find ANY of their good old HC punk here.Musically OK,but targeted at another kind of audiencee,despite their sticking to the anarcho-political lyrics."
5,classic,"i remember the first time i heard this amazing album. it was late at night and i was listening to brent bambury on cbc's ""brave new waves"" radio show. i was completely blown away by it then as i am still am today."
2,"Not worth you money, nothing life changing in the least bit","I've studied other books on Tantra and this one just doesn't compare. I'm into seduction and attraction, tantra just fits in there perfectly but this book was a waste of money."
1,if it sounds too good to be true...,"I was a little suspicious when I read all the amazing reviews. I should have followed my hunch. This book is mostly new age talk with no real advice (ie, ""feel the blue and red flame of your inner love""). What am I supposed to do with that kind of advice? If you're into that, good for you. I'm gonna go look for some more practical advice."
3,Awesome headset if...,"You only want to use it on your cell phone, the cord is only 4ft, so using it on a PC is not possible unless your tower or laptop is right next to you. Description says it includes a 6ft USB dongle, well the dongle was there, however the cord is not included."
2,Doesn't work well with my cell phone,"I ordered this to use with my computer and it does work well and is comfortable. But when I tried to plug it into my cell phone, it cuts out and is unreliable. If you are using this with a computer, it is a good buy, but it does not go between the computer and cell phone well, in my experience."
2,did not work with iPHone 4,the sound quality on my end was great but everyone i called could hear their own voice echo back in their ear piece. i tried 3 different people with 3 different cell phones and 1 land line. all people all would be calling with head set. will be returning items.
4,Okay for cordless landline--fair for Android,"Works great for my cordless land line phone, and that's the only device I'll be using it for. I have to have both hands free so I can type while I talk with clients about contract changes.It's okay for Droid X. I occasionally get dropouts but it might be the included 2.5-to-3.5mm adapter. As long as the phone/cord/connector aren't being moved, it's okay.Comfortable in the ear. It's not used like a typical ear bud and, in fact, requires you to turn the bud perpendicular to the way you'd normally use an ear bud. Although it appears funky and takes a few minutes to get used to, it's just what I was looking for."
2,Too expensive,"This is a very mediocre headset. For $10 -$15 it would be ok, but not for $30. After wearing it for a short time it becomes rather uncomfortable and the sound quality is just ok at best. From what other people have said, apparently the quality of the microphone is good. Also, the cord is very short and I wasn't able to get it to work without the USB dongle that come with it, so it makes it a pain to attach a longer cord.Overall though, just not worth the price"
5,great headset for extended use,I use this headset for work each day. I find it to be very comfortable for extended periods of time. I typically wear it for about 6 hours straight so comfort is a very important factor for me. I barely notice that I am wearing it. I like that you can wear it on either ear. I also really like the seperate controls for the ear piece volume and the microphone volume. The mute also works very well and you dont have to worry about accidentally bumping it. The cord is really long when you have the usb adapter attached & I love it! I can walk around and not worry about running out of cord! Also works great with my cell phone without the usb adapter
3,Flimsy Quality - Great Sound,Within two days of buying this headset for in-home use with Skype the earpiece broke off and I was unable to fix it. The headset provides excellent sound and the microphone is very clear. The quality of the product is VERY cheap and it is quite flimsy - not what I expect from Plantronics (I have a mobile phone headset and office cordless headset from them already and their quality is exceptional).
1,Microphone quality,"I have this headset connected to my HTC EVO 3D with a quality 2.5mm to 3.5mm Blackberry jack converter. I've done numerous tests on conference calls and with friends/family by switching between using the headset and communicating directly into the phone. The consensus is that my voice sounds thick, muffled, and generally unclear. That said, I have a fairly deep voice, but it's not like James Earl Jones or anything. Since I constantly have to repeat myself, it looks like I'll be adding this to the pile of expensive headsets with extremely disappointing microphones. I had hoped that getting away from Bluetooth headsets, which always seem to be critically flawed in one way or another, by switching to a wired headset would help. I don't know why it seems to be such a challenge to create headsets with acceptable microphone clarity..."
2,I get complaints about sound quality,"I was willing to put up with a wire in an effort to get better sound quality than a Blue Tooth product and to get away from charging every night.Sound quality is not good, everyone complains. I have an iPhone and had to buy the adaptor to connect. NO one can hear me! I drive a quiet luxury car, back to Blue Tooth."
5,Wow...One Great Headset,"Just received this headset today. Put it immediately to work. All I can say is WOW! Great mic pickup. Clear reception. Love the behind the ear design. Light, but robust. I'm impressed."
2,"Worked ok, but then the feedback started","My wife used this daily for her calls for work first with a Droid Incredible and then with the Apple iPhone. It lasted for several weeks until starting to give a feedback / echo during conference calls that other people would hear (and it disappeared as soon as she disconnected the headset). On regular calls, people said they had trouble hearing her also. She's upgraded to a more heavy-duty headset (over-head, padded earpiece) and the feedback has gone away. I'd recommend buying something with sturdier construction unless you plan to only use this occasionally."
3,Works ok but pretty fragile,"I've been using this headset for seven months now and it has worked fine from a usability perspective. However, carrying it around (in a backpack to-and-from work) has resulted in the microphone head to break off and the earbud housing has cracked a bit. The unit still functions, but I have to be very gentle with it."
3,Great product but not durable,"I love this product. When using it people can hear me clearly, I can hear them clearly, and it is comfortable compared to other products I have used.I had seen concerns from others that it breaks easily. It does. Mine was no longer usable after about 6 months. The swivel piece that goes into your ear eventually was more ""loose"" than before then shortly after I could not longer be heard by others. I used it several times a day so durability is the only reason I gave it 3 stars.But even with that flaw, I am buying another. I need a device like this for work daily. Most likely, I will order another in 3 more months as a backup since I fully anticipate this next one will also break after 5 or 6 months of use."
3,Works great for cordless home phone -- DOES NOT work with iPhone 4,"Tested out 2 of these 3-in-1 headsets with the included 2.5 -> 3.5 adapters in 2 different iPhone 4 phones (not 4S). When I was on a call, or leaving a voice recording, there was a lot of cutting out of audio and popping. It drops audio out for a half-second every few seconds. And yes, I did make sure the mute button on the headset was off, and I tried both mic amplification settings.Works great on my Panasonic cordless home phone, which is the main reason I got it. That's the reason for 3 stars.But the fact that it does not work on my iPhone is certainly disappointing."
2,constant adjustment,"i was excited when i first got this ear peice. the thing about this ear peice, i would have to constantly adjust it. i felt like the tube was always sticking out from my face. its not stable, and it has way too much curve on it that the picture doesnt show and the tube is longer then what it looks like in the pictures. i was dissapointed, the retail price of this should be $10-$15 at most, if you want to spend more then that on this, its a wast."
2,"The fit is really bad, sound quality is great","I replaced a Plantronics over-the-head mono headset with this one.The earpiece broke after only two weeks use. I could never really tell if the speaker was seated properly in my ear, so I was constantly fidgeting with it, until the ear piece finally broke. The earpiece swivels, and both the speaker half and the non-speaker half are shaped the same, so it is difficult to feel if you have the correct side pushed into your ear while you are using it. It doesn't really fit - it dangles, which often gives the sensation that it has fallen off or out. There simply is not enough there for a snug fit, and while it was far from uncomfortable, it would not be accurate to say that it was comfortable. I am returning this. The sound quality on both mic and speaker was awesome though."
3,First grade info,"The book was not one of the best. I have read 32 Hanson biography books and this one just didn't cut the trade that it needed to, to be atleast useful. I understand alot of things go around about them that aren't true, and when books write about them, it is just stupid. The book needed to get more of the right Information."
5,Great hand repair kit!,"Burt's Bees is the absolute best, especially the hand healing cream and cuticle oil! And the gloves are an added bonus. Buy it, its twice the money @ target!"
5,An engaging look at a fascinating story.,"Not being able to find ""The First Quarter"" I emailed Mr. Kent. He told me that the book he wrote being published by Prima, ""The Ultimate History of Video Games,"" was was a rewrite of ""The First Quarter"" with a little added material. (So if you're loooking for this one and can't find it there you go.) This was the most interesting book I've read in a long time. Reading the stories and history from an insider's perspective was truely fascinating. If you're a gamer I highly recommend this title."
4,Good Basic Start,"I've had this book for many years and always go back to it. The recipes are very basic and like the ones my mom cooked but never documented. Who ever wrote down family recipes to pass on? How do you measure when the recipe is in the cook's head? This year I purchased a copy for each one my children to have. They are all grown and out of the house. This way they have a starting point and can embellish on the recipes. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain photos, but I know the dishes just by the topic, descriptive receipe name and the ingredients."
2,Uninspiring!,"I got this book in the hopes that it would simplify Chinese cooking. No way. It's big, with no pictures. Not a joy to use."
1,Be careful,"These sticks are a poor quality. Several of the sticks didn't light up, and some broke and dripped fluid on the students. yuck!"
1,I thought these where the best,So the one I got will not hold a charge and is totally defective... $150-$200 batterys what a joke.. amazon is taking care of me .. but these things are not as good as when they first came out I bet they are cutting costs and it shows..
1,terrible product,this is the worst product ive ever wasted money on . and ive wasted alot of money in my life. as a matter of fact this thing cost me more money than the purchase price.
5,A timeless treasure,"William Bridges has written a timeless treasure that will help any reader realize the importance of staying the course in transition. Not to go through transition is to be stuck where you're at. We've all seen people who have not been able to make it past the loss of a job, a financial position or a relationship loss. We can't let these things define us. This book will show the path beyond......the updated 2004 audio edition is very helpful!"
2,"Reader from Reading, PA","This book was okay, but it basicaly gave me no real information on dealing with transitions. I thought it would be much more in depth than it was and came from it, not too impressed. I think a little more effort into the book and could of been really good."
5,Good product.,"I thought it was a pretty decent nail trimmer.Easy to sanitize and to use, even for me, who has small hands.This is a guillotine-style nail trimmer. Works fine for my Sharpei."
2,id rather read a clancy novel than play this again,"horrible graphics, bad controls, annoying guy in your ear saying ""no tangos in site"" It took me about 30 minutes to beat on the hard difficulty level. I bought it back when it cost 70 bucks, plus i thought i had to buy a control pack to save a game. You dont need to save a game, because if you cant beat it in one sitting you shouldnt be play video games. Go out and buy a ps2 and play some real games (n64 is dead)"
5,Very Realistic and fun filled,this game is so much fun you can choose a wide variety of weapons the game is very realistic
1,dumbed down,"If you are a member in the field, this book is not for you. It is written for persons with very general interests in memory. It distills decades of complicated (and, at times, problematic) research into 7 constructs. Very disapointing if you are fond of Dr. Schacters scientific work. If you are deeply interested in memory, the Oxford Handbook of Memory should serve you better."
1,misleading product description,"The item description of the particular one that I purchased was misleading. Reading it I thought this was the adapter to fill the small tanks from a large one. This is not the case. I have not checked to see what the description says now. The item may or may not work for its actual purpose, it has no function in my set up."
2,Keeping up with the kadashians,I recieved 2 of disc 1.... I didn't get disc 2:( it's there away you can ship it me?
5,THIS IS THE DOORS!!!,"MORRISON HOTEL is another AMAZING album by the legendary THE DOORS!!!!!!on MORRISON HOTEL, DOORS start to record with a real BASS player, and the result is a TOTAL ROCK MASTERPIECE with gens like the classic ROADHOUSE BLUES, PEACE FROG, YOU MAKE ME REAL, QUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY and MAGGIE M[GILL!!!!!!!THIS IS THE DOORS at their pinnacle rulling the ROCK world!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, DOORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It's ok.,I'm a Barry White fan since I was 17 (I'm 39 now) and I'm still dreaming about Barry producing songs as he used to do. This new cd is ok; if you are a true BW fan you definitely would ask for more !
2,Is it just me? It must be just me...,"...I think Barry has lost some of his range and the melodic nature of his voice. Sure the icon is love but I think he's ridden on his reputation on this one. Sounds like a rushed attempt to cash in on his 'sudden' fame from exposure on the sex sitcom ""Ally McBeal""..like that version of Sly's ""Thank You..""? I expect better from him. This could have been much better."
2,I really wanted to like it,"My aunt gave this to my son for his 2nd birthday today and the very first one they gave him did not work out of the box. I returned it and got another to replace it, which did work... but not well.On carpet it moves very slowly and I could tell the motor was laboring. It worked fine on the hard floors in our kitchen. The signal from the remote was very spotty- you had to have it pointed directly at the truck to make it work. Even then it would occasionally stop working for no reason. Our son also liked pushing it around by hand, but the motor made a terrible clicking sound while he was pushing it.I really wanted to like this toy- the soft body is perfect for him at this age, but this is just not a good toy."
1,Worst Remote Toy ever,We got this toy for my 2-year old since his older brother would have a remote control car. This never worked even with new batteries. It was difficult to even get to the battery pack. It was a waste of our money and our son was really sad when he didn't have a remote control car like his brother. Don't waste your money or your time on this product.
1,Fun for 10 minutes,"Got it for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It lasted about 10 minutes. In general it is what it is advertised as--easy to control, soft, and fun. It has a gear that is supposed to disengage the motor when a child pushes it like a normal toy. This gear never worked correctly in ours and caused something to bind and snap causing it to stop turning. Getting a refund!"
1,Doesnt work well and low battery life,"I bought this item brand new else where (not amazon), my experience with the item was very bad.Cons:- Very very dificult to install the batteries , to whoever designed the battery system is definitely low on usability skills :) and who ever designed the user manual is completely nuts .. no clue how to open, I had to research for 20mins,- Did not last long. After 10 mins playing the motor slowed down as though the battery died.- Doesnt work on Carpet. The truck was moving with great diffculty on carpet - the motor is not as powerful, works great on hardwood.Pros:- Really fun toy, My son was super excited for the first 10mins when it actually worked.- I think my son started to learn and think how the truck was moving with remote control ..it was interesting to see him pondering.Summary: definitely great toy idea for kids but this one doesnt meet the bar .... it sint work more than 10 mins after it was out of the box, battery dried up or motor was stuck .."
2,12 INCH range?,"This toy works - but only if you place the antenna within 12 inches of the truck. In an effort to make the antenna short, they have made this a toy which only works when you walk with it, nearly touching it the whole time! Therefore I would NOT recommend buying it. Children want to stand in one spot and be able to drive it around a bit, not have to practically touch it the whole time. If your child is under 4 years old they won't understand this concept. It simply drives a few inches then stops, and they don't understand why. It seems broken. They will be bored and frustrated with it in a minute or two. I don't recommend this product to anyone. (I will be lengthening the antenna on mine so it isn't a total waste.)"
1,the remote control refuse to work,"i put batteries in the fire truck and remote and it does not work. A manufacturing fault I think, because it does a little something if the toy is on. But after that nothing. It just doesn't work."
2,Too Lound,I bought this for a friends son and he found it way too loud and didn't like it. Even when his parents put tape over the speaker. I was so excited for him to get it and it's his least favorite toy.
2,"Super fun, but only lasted 1 month","My 2 year old son got this for Christmas, and he absolutely loved it. It was a hit! But now that it is a month later, it doesn't work correctly. He is 2, so he hasn't been super careful with it, but since it is meant for that age group, I figured it would hold up much better than it did. Really disappointed."
3,Orchid for Dummies,"This is an informative book for the treatment and care of Orchids. There are better books, and there is a site on line that gives you weekly tips. (Burdak)."
4,Very Helpful,"As a beginning Orchid grower I have found this book invaluable. It takes the mystery out of growing these beautiful plants and steers the beginner away from the most common beginners errors, like watering and feeding too much. The section on re-potting is clear, concise,and very helpful, as is the entire book.If you are just starting out as an orchid grower you could do much worse than buying this book."
5,Great Beginner Orchid Book,"As a beginning orchid grower I was a bit intimidated by the whole topic. But after reading Frowine's book, the topic seems much more approachable. I've started with a few moth orchids and they've done well, but now I'm inspired to try some oncidiums and paphiopedilums. I really would like to try some fragrant orchids as well.I like the straight forward cultural information. It's clear the temperature, humidity, and light levels needed for the various orchids. It gives me a sense of which ones to try and which to wait on. The orchid photos in the center are inspiring, though I'd love to see more!I also liked the in-depth listing of varieties for the various orchid types. There's a whole world of orchids out there to grow.A great book for anyone starting out in orchids growing. Clearly written with the usual ""dummies"" humor and lightness. A good starting point for orchid growing."
1,WHAT A WASTE,"An excellent founding idea, the lost Gospel of Judas (an authentic text that refutes the Resurrection) is lost in a self-indulgent swamp of pointless extraneous subplots. The most important thing with this idea is the world's reaction: the weakening of Chrisendom and the strengthening of Islam. Instead we get a hackneyed rendition of the adulterous priest-cliche, a pointless set of flashbacks to WWII, and a general abandonment of realism for the sake of a lazy, trite story that dribbles off into a stupid and inconclusive ending. The only reason I bothered to finish listening to this as a book on tape was to see if the ending was going to be as bad as the rest, but it was even worse. Don't buy this flaccid ineffectual screed with its pseudo-Dostoevskian airs."
4,Made for a lively discussion,"My Book Club of eleven women read this book and it certainly made for a lively discussion! I found the book to be very interesting and thought-provoking and it brought up many timely issues about religion. You have to remember that it is a work of fiction, but it was interesting to discuss the theological basis for the book. I would recommend it."
3,marred remastering,"The remastering has cleaned up each frame and made each frame that much more visually acute. Unfortunately the quality is not consistent across frames. This is especially apparent on consecutive frames with dark pictures. Some frames have perceptibly darker tones than the surrounding ones. Also the film freezes at the end of track 18, in transition to track 19, ruining the experience."
3,Kurosawa's hidden comedy,"Famous for being one of the inspirations for ""Star Wars"" (particularly R2-D2 and C-3PO) this might be Kurosawa's lightest adventure. It's a great movie and Toshiro Mifune is as fun to watch as ever, but the story is decidedly less heavy. I really enjoyed the movie, but the poor quality of the DVD and the woefully misinformed ""Engrish"" subtitles made me sad...but then you can always enjoy it for its badness, can't you. Avoid foreign imports for this one if you can."
4,"The Hidden Fortress - Criterion Collection by Toshir Mifune, Misa Uehara","""The Hidden Fortress"" is interesting primarily because it gave George Lucas ideas for ""Star Wars"". which is why I got it, the influence is obvious. An interesting combat scenes with Toshir Mifune (mounted & dismounted w/spear)."
5,"Inspired Star Wars, a Great Movie",The Hidden Fortress may have inspired Star Wars but it is a hilarious and exciting movie in its own right. 3 thumbs up!
5,Much more than your average medieval epic,"This movie is much more subtle than a lot of people give it credit for. Ostensibly, it's a typical medieval epic with knights, princesses, swordplay. But the point of view is almost completely from that of two peasants, who never think of anything except their own survival and greed, and yet who manage -- almost in spite of their best efforts -- to save the princess several times.As someone else has written, this movie is ""big fun."""
3,Fun Songs,"In times where the charts are dominated by boy bands, soppy love songs and girls who can't really sing but do look nice while attempting to, it's great to have albums and bands like this one.Sure in twenty years time none of these songs will be in music hall of fames but who cares? These songs are fun, simple and you don't have to think about them too much. Never Had So Much Fun, Summer's Here and I Don't Need Your Loving are my favourites.Lyrics are also included which is a good thing because their accents are pretty strong in some songs but once you know the words you will understand. Also photos in the cover booklet of a plastic camel in an ever emptying pint of beer. Go on, have some fun,..."
3,"Great, but no ""Meet The Family""","The new album by Frenzal Rhomb is impressive in it's own right, full of fast, punky songs, but with a good deal of melody too. However, it can't hold a candle to the band's previous release, ""Meet the Family."" While there are quite a few great songs on the album (notably tracks 1,2,5,11, and 12, among others), there are also some songs that lack that humor and riffs that made the last album spectacular. ""A Man's Not A Camel"" comes highly recommended, but given the choice, you should purchase ""Meet the Family"" first. But of course if you already have ""Family,"" you've got nothing to lose!"
3,The book vs dvd/cd product on tv,"Just in case anyone was considering trying/purchasing the dvd program on tv, the book has the same info - beware. So, you can pay the $20-30 for the book and read the info yourself or you can pay $600 for the dvds/cds, journal and 2 workbooks and basically have him read it to you. Besides that, the 30 day trial offer actually expires in just under 30 days (calculated from when you are billed not from when you receive the product as the reps tell you). So you will be billed for the first installment within 30 days. Please be aware of that.The info is decent but very little of it is something original. If you are brand new to the ""how to be successful"" quest then there is helpful info such as vision mapping and how-to's of communication. Otherwise, if you already know how to write detailed goals and communicate your ideas the material might be a good refresher for you - therefore put into practice what you already know."
4,interesting read,Interesting read...thought provoking as to how we should be doing things... Full review once i read and mull it over
4,real doggie seat belt,"Unlike most car harnesses that are just to keep your dog from crawling around the car, this one actually provides crash safety (for your dog _and_ you). It goes on pretty easily and can be used as a makeshift leash when traveling in the car.The only problem is the strap guide where the straps cross the chest slides too easily and the dog can work their way out of the harness. We sewed the straps together with some heavy nylon thread where the straps cross to prevent them from sliding and it solved the problem, noting that the harness won't fit another dog of vastly differing size (we'll buy another one of that becomes the case), and noting that the sewing may not hold in a crash (but that shouldn't be a problem because the harness wasn't designed to require the straps to hold together in that spot during a crash)."
2,Driving me NUTS trying to get a seal on Lexus,"This thing is built WELL, it looks like a GREAT solution to the problem. However, I got all ready to do this job today and can't get the universal cap squarely around the master cylinder due to the geometry. It's not as simple as it sounds, depending on what your master cylinder looks like. I tried different orientations and still can't get it to hold 5 psi, let alone 10 or 15. I don't know why they just don't come up with a pressure cap for each car manufacturer. I have 2 Toyota products - aren't there certainly enough of them on the road to warrant that???I may update this review if I can finally get it to seal. I sure don't like the geometry involved though, especially with a fragile plastic master cylinder."
5,great quality great price,this Oat Bran is hard to find in stores near me. exactly the right grain i needed and a great price! Will order more from this company.
2,No speed dial or answering machine,"The phone has excellent sound quality but I was very disappointed that it only has three speed dial numbers - It has 8 extension buttons that I will never use since it is for my home office. They should have reversed the buttons, 10 speed dials and 3 extensions.It lacks an answering machine that my last 2 line phone had. When I purchased it I just assumed that it had a built in answering machine (my mistake for not reading the features list on the box)."
1,Broke today!!,I purchased this item in July and today the display screen is just blank!! Poor quality or some sort of manufacturing defect!
3,Disappointing,"I have been using this phone for about 10 months now, and I'm in the market again for another one. It hasn't broken, but it just isn't good. As others have noted, the buttons are hard to push and the display is not backlit. The phone also has an annoying lag between the time you pick up the handset and the time it connects to the caller. On the plus side, though, the speakerphone is very good."
4,This review refers to the audiobook,"This was a nice, fast paced story of reconciliation, healing and forgiveness. The meant-to-be type of romance between soulmates appeals to my hopelessly romantic heart, and I especially like the mature way Marnie stood up against her parent's controlling manipulativeness, leaving the door open for acceptance and a loving resolution."
3,I had a hard time relating to the characters,"The books overall story is great but I had a hard time getting lost in the characters. I find that many of Delinskys books leave you a little distanced from the characters. I empathized with the characters, but it didn't hold my interest as would other novels I have read. It reminds me of jumping in the shower before taking my clothes off.. I like my books to slowly envelope my mind and take over. This did not do that."
2,Real World?,"Although I have enjoyed Barbara Delinsky's more recent novels, this one was so full of unrealistic sex that one could forget the plot!"
2,Worse Than the First One,"Two things really annoyed me about this book. One was the cut and paste from the first book when the author had to provide information about the background of the town and some of the continuing characters. Maybe it was more noticeable to me because I was reading the first and second books so close together, but it struck me as lazy writing because the language was totally the same. At least find some new way to express the same information. Yes, one character is gay and hates his first name, another one won $25,000 on Jeopardy-- but neither point is germane to this particular mystery!Second, the climax when the killer is revealed is handled in almost exactly the same way. Not that the killer is any surprise. Western Union couldn't have telegraphed it any more obviously.So, no, I don't recommend this book."
3,Nice idea... in theory,It sounds like such a cool idea! Wow! 101 songs all under :30 long.That is... until you listen to it. I'm all for nice quick punk blasts... but it gets old 30 or 40 songs into the disc.
1,Magic,"Not exactly what I was looking for. Piece was well written; however, the book itself looked to be printed on papyrus and was rough. Will still keep the book in my collection. It was worth the money."
3,Good for cheap laughs,"This album has to be one of Poonanny's finest. I say this hesitantly, seeing as I have not listened to his ""Ponyrider"" album as of yet. Poonanny's unique blend of quasi-funk/blues shows itself throughout every song, as well as constant... innuendos. ""Meat Man"" is probably my favorite song on the album, with its ribald lyrics. ""Rump Ringer,"" however, is more musically sound, and has a catchier hook."
2,Staggering Omission,"My comment is based on the 1981 edition.While the work indeed covers a lot of ground, there is a major omission concerning the history of the 20th Century. The authors have devoted a chapter to the Second World War ... that utterly fails to mention the Holocaust.Considering the education of those who authored the work, it is hard to escape the conclusion that this was a deliberate omission. That this event is not mentioned makes me wonder what the real thrust of this work is and what political agendas the authors might have. I was frankly surprised that as prestigious an institution as Columbia University would publish a work with such a staggering omission about a key event in history.I would hope that later editions have corrected this error."
3,This was also a movie,"While I haven't read the book, this same story was the plot for a 1993 movie, ""Money for Nothing"" staring John Cusack. While of course given the Hollywood treatment (no mention of drug use), the storyline seemed stretched for 100 minutes of film so I have trouble believing it could sustain an entire book (see other review on magazine possibilities). While I've enjoyed Mark Bowden's other books, I think I'll pass on this one and stick to the 100 minute version . . ."
2,Lessons on what NOT to do if this ever happens to you,"Unlike other Bowden books, this one was a little disappointing. Not because of Bowden's style but because the story is just page after page of a [person] who can't keep his mouth shut about his recent find. It is a quick read, because there is not that much to the story. Still, the story could have been summarized more or less in a lenghty magazine column. One last thing, Joey Coyle is made out to be kind of a Robin Hood for how he was giving his money out. From reading the book, I think he was more just someone seeking the attention of being ""that guy"" thus showing his generosity only to increase his fleeting moment of popularity. Ultimately I finished the book only because I paid for it, and I found myself counting the pages until it was finished."
4,1 million buck found and lost!,"What an idiot!! All through this book I was confounded by this guy's stupidity! It has been a life dream to have this sort of money faqll into my hands, and I've spent countless hours imagining how I'd manage the process of hanging onto it! He couldn't contain himself and let the cat out of the bag, almost immediately! I was cringing with desperation over the way he blew it! What an idiot!"
2,Almost Perfect - edited,"Previous one I have didn't work well with Linux, this one does. But, switching from port 3 to any other port requires me to unplug every thing except the port I want to switch to. Because this switch is transparent to Linux though, that bad 'stuck on 3' feature only costs one star. Found another port that requires me to unplug everything to get it to switch. There goes another star.After using this for a while, the refusal to switch to another port has become very annoying. I have put this one in my spare parts pile. This persistent annoyance has cost another star."
4,Works like a charm,Does exactly what it claimed and has worked without exception from day one. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I would have preferred it to have had a mechanical switching option (or instead of) the software controlled switching... just not a fan of the software option in general -- this one has worked flawlessly.
5,This book really gets you moving !,"I've read many motivational books and this is the best. One read and you'll be charging out of bed in the morning. If Scott doesn't inspire you with a zest for the adventures of life, he will shame you out of laziness and procrastination. I had trouble finding this book after borrowing it from a friend. Now I've come back to Amazon to buy other books written by Scott"
4,good book,"this is part of the dave ramsey book set that he makes his new employees read. The overall concept is great and the encouragement to take charge and win in whatever (life, business, etc.) Some items are bit immature in thought, e.g. inflation is good because you will make a million dollars sooner and a lot of sentences seemed to end ""!"".. But overall a good book to remind on how to achieve your goals."
4,CHARGE!,Alexander takes motivational and leadership literature to a whole new realm with this book. Fun and easy book to read. I loved the concept of being a rhino so much I bought a rhino mug!
5,Travis Campbell President Ensumble Records North America,"The CD Features ""friends prayer"", this inspirational song touches every aspet of human thought. It is sure to be a Universal Anthem. Trudy gives an electrifying performance in her live shows. Which captures the essence of her spirit. This song deleves a realm beyond Alan Jackson's masterpiece to become a Universal Icon, know throughout all humanity."
2,Not What They Were Live,I went and saw this group when they were near my home town...their live concert is not what their CDs are..too many horns and back up voices on the CD...they should stick with just their own sound...they seem like they want to get famous and forget the blues basics.A Southern Blues Fan
1,Adapter,"This product works for a while then just rusts and locks to the connection.This product stinks. It was delivered quickly, and I'm sure the seller is honest an well intentioned. Just didn't work for me.Skuter"
5,Great Event,All fights on main card are finished none go to decision very good card with including my two favorites; Florian and Lesnar. This is a good DVD to own even if you have seen it its a solid event overall would recommend.

3,All Weather Bird Feeder,"Excellent construction but assembly instructions vague and difficult to follow. After installing feeder found only small birds:chickadees, nuthatch and titmouse have used the feeder. Starlings try but not prevalent. Cardinals, sparrows (song, white throated and juncos haven't flown up to it after 3 weeks. Feeder has fallen three times: First and third bottom perch became unscrewed. Replaced with lock washer... If it fails again will resort to thread lock. Top attachment came loose and feeder fell to deck but didn't break. Very sound, sturdy construction. However, the top screw also""unscrewed"" causing the fall of main feeder. Recommend checking both top and bottom bolts (screws?) checked for tightness at least every 2 weeks - or sooner.I am using sunflower kernels.. Very small bits of peanuts or other shelled nuts could be used, but birds have difficulty removing seeds from feeder. I doubt if regular sunflower seeds, even black oil, would work."
5,RB: The Widow Maker--Wonderful Story,"I found this book very imaginative, easy reading. Knowing Cody as a 'sister' and a friend, I have watched this book take shape from the beginning and knew the gist of the story. Now I can't wait for book #2 to come out. I'm very proud of you for this wonderful story. Normally I don't read adventure/romance type stuff, but I enjoyed the story immensely. Congratulations to both of you. Hope you have continued success.Anna (Bearheart) Edwards"
5,"IT IS A TERRIFIC CD, DON'T WALK AROUND MAD WITHOUT IT.","SHE TALKS ABOUT TRUE CHURCH HOUSE HAPPENING'S, IT SHOULD BRING DELIVERANCE TO THE TRADITIONAL CHURCH ."
2,So so,"Prior to reading this book I read another submarine book ""take her deep"" by Galantin. The author of that book had served on a submarine the Halibut and told in a vivid way of his time on her. The book was fascinating.Bowfin by comparson was dissapointing. The writer is either a historian or journalist who simply has written a book based on some secondary sources. It makes rather dull reading. Another weakness is that the unlike ""take her deep"" there is no real effort to work out what had really happened during the combat patrols. One example of this was an encounter in which the crew of the sub thought that they sank a battleship. Galantin did a fascinating reconstruction to show that the ship sunk was probably a destroyer and illustrates in some detail why mistakes such as that were made.In Bowfin the author makes no real attempt to look at the reasons why post hostilities evaluations of sinkings were different from those claimed in the war.In sum give it a miss there are better books."
4,Morality Tale,A Japanese language subtitled film and morality tale replete with very interesting cultural features--particularly recurring ceremonial bowing and gestures that predominate. The film is over 50 years old but still conveys some universal and ageless messages about contemporary life. The characters are alternately funny and moving. Much to like here.
5,What would you do if you had less than a year to live?,"Along with ""Seven Samurai"", this is often considered to be Kurosawa's greatest film. It may move you to tears, but there's not a single moment of sentimentality or ""tear-jerking"" in the movie. A warning is in order: this is that rare thing, a work of art which may make you feel you need to change your own life. Don't see it unless you are willing to risk a painful existential wake-up call."
1,Yuck! Threw it in the trash!,"Tried Crest Pro Health Toothpaste. Seems OK as you're brushing but when you're done, it tastes like you just ate bad cheese. No fresh feeling like a good mint toothpaste. I ended up throwing what tubes we had in the trash and going out to buy regular Crest with Scope -- much better! This stuff is awful -- don't waste your money!"
5,Fresh Clean Feeling,"I love this toothpaste. The taste is great, I usually don't like cinnamon. But this tastes good. I don't have that film feeling in my mouth like the other people say they do. although I do when I wake up in the morning (no matter what toothpaste I used the night before). It does foam up alot but I LIKE that, and its good for you. I am an RN and all that foam better gets between teeth to kill plauqe causing bacteria. I have NEVER even heard of red streaks/stains. It sounds like lies or people being drama queens. I mean the ADA says this is the best toothpaste right now. I recommend this stuff highly, you feel cleaner."
1,I'll never use pro heath again!!!!,"After using the whitening version of this product for two weeks by cheeks and inside of lower lip became red and rough. The next day white ""canker sore"" eruptions occurred throughout my mouth. I have never had more than one canker sore in my mouth at a time in my life. My dentist said it could have been an a reaction to a new toothpaste, and bingo, I knew it was this stuff. HORRIBLE! I haven't been able to eat anything more than vanilla ice cream, milk, and white bread for 4 days now. The pain is horrible and unrelenting. No over the counter remedies are helping, and I've purchased them all. Similar reports are all over the internet. Be careful!!!!"
2,It aint that good of a movie.............,"the movie had poor production, poor sound effects, stupid story line, and bad acting!!!"
5,It doesn't get much more entertaining than this.,"What can I say. I was rolling on the floor. And then when I read the review by mattimusthegreek@hotmail.com, I rolled on the floor again, this time at work, trying to figure out the foot stabbing myself. The ninjas on kite's are hilarious. On a serious note the acrobatics and fight scenes are very entertaining. I caught this movie on a cable channel, but I plan to get my own copy very soon. It was very fun to watch."
5,5 Ninja Stars,"Any movie that features lots and lots of Ninjas in it is worth buying. This movie has armies of ninjas.Movies like the Godfather, for example, are classics....but if they had ninja assassins in it, it would be 10 times better...you all know what I'm getting at."
3,adequate,Phone opearation is fine but I do not underdstand why an electronic device that must be plugged in to operate properly does not have a lighted screen. It negates many features if the room is not lit.
3,A Disjointed Book,"This book is an odd mixed bag: The sections dealing strictly with the Rogers murder are informative and well-done. However, the intersecting Poe biography is full of blatant factual errors and, like so much writing about Poe, is tiresomely tabloid-like in its approach. Also, the effort to juxtapose Poe's life with Rogers' simply doesn't work. The effect or these dual ""plotlines"" is jarring, and makes it difficult to fully get into either of their stories.In short, it's worthwhile to read this book if you're interested in true crime in general or the Rogers case in particular. If you want to learn about Poe, however, you should look elsewhere."
3,Interesting read,"Truth, fiction, and what the papers report are three sides of one story. This books examines all of these different parts of a story. At times, some facts and stories are repeated like the reader can't remember what was previously read, but it's easy enough to scan and skip the bits. It is a good insight into Poe, literature, history, and early nineteenth century newspapers. Read, be informed, and discover the mystery."
3,Red Stable Set OK,Breyer Stablebates Red Stable SetI wish I had read the reviews before I bought the item. There was no time to get something different. GOOD suggestion to glue the stable together. It IS flimsy. It looks much more sturdy in the picture than it is. We opted like another reviewer to not glue on the roof making it easy for my granddaughter to get horses in and out. The little horses are brittle instead of soft plastic. HorsesBreyer Stablemates Gift Set 4 Piecedon't stand very well. My granddaughter is happy - but I don't think the toy will stand the test of time. I agree - this is more a display item than a toy to be played with. Recommend Schleich or Safari plastic horses instead.
3,Falls apart easily but allows for creative play,"Santa brought this for my animal-loving daughter last year and her frustration with the toy lead to its collecting dust. It falls apart if you so much as bump it and she enjoys moving toys from room to room. I used Superglue to hold it together, which worked reasonably well. The roof doesn't stay on at all. Since she needs to remove it for play, that's a problem, since without the roof, the structure is very weak (Superglue & all).It's about what you'd expect for the money. I would recommend searching for a one-piece set with no assembly or a sturdier one, maybe made of wood.I know Breyer is a classic name so I took a chance that the toy would be a better quality than it is. My daughter plays with the horses and the fence but I think after a year of ""My stable broke again!"" it's time to take my own advice and find something better."
2,Nice to look at. Not so nice to play with.,The barn is too smakl. It is difficult to put the horses in and out. The doors are difficult to snap in securely. The barn needs to be a bit roomier. The horses are nice - much nicer than those that come with the Melissa & Doug mini fold and go. But the Melissa & Doug barn is significantly better constructed for plsy. Buy the Melissa & Doug mini fold and go barn and then by Breyer stablemates horses for best play experience.
1,Stable falls apart,The stable literally falls apart when my granddaughter plays with it. The roof falls off. It was a Christmas present and was hard for my son-in-law to get it to stay together.
5,What an adventure!,"Katherine easely moved up to the top of my best books ever read list. It has it all . . . history, romance, maidens, knights, heroes and villains. This is one of those books you just can't put down! Enjoy it!"
4,Katherine,like this book & reading another of Anya Setons books also recommending to a friend who also likes English Lit.
3,"Good, but not as great as I thought it would be","Several of my friends raved about this book. I liked it okay. And I love to read so much; I'm not that hard to please. There were several kind of raunchy parts that I didn't expect, as well as numerous bawdy references. But there is a theme of redemption in the end that I liked quite a lot that makes the story more...well, redeeming. The last 150 pages or so were the best, I think. It wasn't riveting for me, but the history was really interesting, and I learned a lot."
5,Wonderful Story,I had purchased this book after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon and I was not sure if it would live up to all the talk. Well it was really a wonderful story and I loved it. I loved reading this historical fiction tale and I would highly recommend it. Anyone who loved The Other Boleyn Girl will also love this book. I also think that a few of the reviewers were critical of John and that they do not get that he was just a product of his time and was a good man and very good to Katherine. I thought he was very sexy!
3,Great book -- terrible Kindle edition,Katherine is one of my favorite books of all time. I bought it for my Kindle for a late summer re-read. I'm sorely disappointed in the Kindle version. It was scanned badly from an original and was not proofread. It is riddled with scanning errors. It's so bad that I'm going to try to find a way to get a refund. Very disappointed in Amazon/Kindle for this one.
5,So glad I trusted the reviews and read this book!,"In an effort to find excellent historical fiction I have come across ""Katherine"" many times on Amazon and for some reason or another passed it by. However, the five-star review kept coming up and after reading it I thoroughly agree. The book was nearly 600 pages, small print, and I could not put it down until it was finished. It was long enough to develop the characters and the plot and the landscape so beautifully and thoroughly that I almost felt as though I had experienced an entire lifetime with Katherine. Seton did a spectacular job of giving you enough information to really understand the political side of the story without being wordy or boring, and I came away feeling as though I had a much better grasp of this period in history. As far as historical fiction goes, this book is definitely one of the best I've ever read. The fact that it was based on truth just makes it that much more impacting. Enjoy!"
5,Love Story,"I already had an older copy of this book which I had read so many times over the years that the pages were coming loose. While I understand that it is fiction, I still appreciate the beautiful, if illicit, love between a powerful noble and a commoner in a time when marriage between two such people was unheard of."
2,Typos,"Under normal circumstances, I'd give this book 5 stars because the writing and story are brilliant. However, the number of absolutely ridiculous and unwarranted typos in the text was so irritating I seriously thought about calling to complain and ask for my money back. What a disgrace."
4,Good Love Story,"Since this was written in the fifties you don't get the raunch that love stories nowadays have, but it was good none the less. The story, for me, began too slow and ended too fast, with so much time passing inbetween that you had to be caught up with nearly every chapter, or every ""part"" so that sometimes you were left confused and wondering. That was why I gave it four stars. The writing is great, however, very discriptive and enjoyable. The characters themselves are very in depth and realistic, and the time spent with each one is appropriate. I did love the ending, with Katherine finally marrying her long time lover, and discovering the fate of her daughter who had disappeared years ago, something I correctly predicted before it happened. I'll recommend this book to all my friends, and to anyone who reads this review."
5,A wonderful read,"I found at first this book was hard to get into, and hard to read and understand at first. However I would say that around page 100 I was so into this book and could not put it down. It was such a wonderful story, and based on a true one. This book was for me a lot better than even Forever Amber or Through the glass darkley. I would recommend to all, it is a clean book with no 'dirty' parts."
2,Had to send it back,This wonderful historical novel showed up on my Kindle like it had been copied from a secondhand paperback which had fallen in the bathtub a couple of times. Every page had miscopied words and names. What a disappointment. Amazon wants Kindle readers to have a seamless reading experience....this wasn't it. I will buy it again IF they clean up the text.
1,Akai TV Sucks,This piece of junk lasted 2.5 years. After about a year the screen quality degraded with black smears in various places. At 2.5 years it quit working completely. Since I paid about $750 for the piece of junk that's a cost of $300/year. What a deal.
3,"Great TV, mediocre DVD player","This is the second AKAI LCT2721AD television I purchased, because the DVD player went out on the first one. Had this one less than six months, and the DVD player went out again. Good television, bad DVD player! Spend a little more for a better one. I should have (twice!)."
5,Awesome Chop-Socky Shaw Brothers Movie,"Awesome movie from the Kung Fu Masters, The Shaw Brother. Great action, cool storyline, everything a kung fu film should be. Definitley a worthwhile film."
5,No Doubt About It The Best Kung Fu Flick #1,"This is the #1 one Kung Fu film out. The Five Deadly Venoms combines all the elements that make up a great Kung Fu Movie. The idea of a school where you wear masks to conceal your identity while you are learning the deadliest forms of Kung Fu: 1=Centipede, 2=Snake, 3=Scorpion, 4=Lizard and 5=Toad to later go out into to the world and never know who your classmates were. They could be the bum on the corner or the richest man in town. When the time comes to use your skills only then shall the truth come out."
1,IT AIN'T A CELESTIAL PICTURES RELEASE !!!,"THIS DVD LIKE SO MANY RELATED TO THE SHAW BROTHERS COLLECTION, THAT ARE NOT RELEASED BY CELESTIAL PICTURES ARE A SHAM !!! I WILL NOT SUPPORT SOME LOW DOWN PIRATES LOOKING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK !! IF IT AIN'T RELEASED BY CELESTIAL IT AIN'T WORTH A DIME !!!"
5,great,"the product arrived within the estimated ship date. The movie was dub in english, so it was very understandable. thanks"
1,Clive Barker is a sick man,"At first I had some hopes for this story, but as the book went on it became stanger and stranger and then sicker and sicker. Clive Barker must be warped to even imagine such demoralizing sexual acts and views. If ""Old Hollywood or New Hollywood"" even faintly resembles the goings on in this novel we should burn the whole place down."
3,MAYBE IT'S ME...,"I'm new to Clive Barker. I've read plenty of fabu reviews of his talent. THE NEXT STEPHEN KING!!! I read his short story HUMAN REMAINS and was impressed, indeed.Then I tried to read 3 of his novels, including this one. I dont get it, where's the beef? He write's better than SK but his story deflates, after a page or two, into bland nuthin.I think his inner florist had a terminal eruption of hubris after his early success."
1,Yeuck!,If you've ever suffered from depression - give this one a miss.Maybe if you like nasty horror and pointless sex you might find it's plot appealing - if you can find a plot that is.
1,A Real Teroraea of a Novel,"A formulaic combination of the author's tired world-hidden-in-something-innocuous device, and a profusion of dialog and sexuality of the most trivial kind -- which I can only guess is there to meet some kind contractual length obligation. The rest is made up of syrupy coprafluences about Los Angeles, its people, and the author's wanderings about the world in general.The 50-plus page cathardic epilog might have been necessary if the story were in the least bit frightening."
2,Blech.,"Well...I've been a Barker fan for years and years. And until this point, not a thing has come out that I have not enjoyed. Until now. I have defended his work in the past maybe sometimes when I should not have. I will not defend this. It was garbage. It seemed like just an excuse to put as much sex as you could in a novel without the novel going anywhere. It just kind of ended...and poorly. There was no emotion or feeling for me. The only reason why I give it two stars is because...well...I'm retarded and I like him too much not to."
3,"Quick Interesting Read, but not scary","This was the first Clive Barker novel I have read. I got the title from a list of scary ghost stories. I can not complain too much about a book that is almost 700 pages and I read in three days. It was entertaining and interesting, just not scary. I was hoping for a good ghost story that might make me check under the bed, but did not get it. Not a bad book, just not scary."
2,Nice but not what I was looking for,"These boots where nice. I liked the shaft part and how it went over the knee. The part I didn't like was the actual shoe part. It looked like it had a hidden platform sole, which is not my style; so I returned them. If you like platform shoes, then this is the boot for you."
2,doesn't fit right,"The boot only comes in whole sizes you can't get it in a 6 1/2 or a 7 1/2 it has to be a 6 or a 7 well one size is to small & they other size is to big & the heal doesn't feel right, it feels like it's to far forward it doesn't feel like a very comfortable boot."
2,Hmmmm,"The Mpio is a so-so player that can be extremely costly if you want to hold more than 2 hours of music. Its a very sleek and cool looking device with many different options and modes to keep anyone entertained, such as the radio, and voice recorder amoung other things. The real downside to this player is its lack of memory, and upgradability. It costs me nearly 75 bucks for a new sd card. :(. I also own a sony NE-410 minidisc player (also $100) and it has been much better in many cases. It holds 5 hours of music on one 1.50 minidisc. It has served me better than the mpio."
1,peice-o-junk,Ok so here is the story: i was so exited to get an mp3 players ya well when i got this my excitment went down. it didnt work so i got a new one from comp*usa that had 2 the memory and the same features
2,wow! a product made for everyone but people in America!,"You will undoubtedly want an MP3 player some day. If and whenthis day comes, you will undoubtedly be taken by the size andbeauty of the MPIO players from Digitalway. Hopefully, at this point, you realize you will some day want to purchase mp3 music to place inside your new mp3 player. Unfortunately, you will not be able to find any music that the MPIO will play, as nthe music on apple's hugely successful itunes cannot be read by this mp3 player. When you go to the website to request a firmware upgrade be written for your new MPIO, you will realize without much effort that the company, in Denmark or somewhere, has no idea what you're talking about. You will then undoubtedly heave this hunk of wasted technology and by an ipod."
1,I had such high hopes,"I had great hopes for this player. There is even a free after market software for it. There is a Yahoo owner's site which does help. The player has good memory. It looks good and it is light. BUT, it is a pain to download music into it. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it is not only slow, but sometimes the downloading process freezes. Also,it is hard to connect it to other software like Musicmatch or Windows etc. One night prior to going on vacation I tried to remove an old playlist and fill it up with new music and I was unsuccesful. I have wasted hours upon hours trying to get my play lists into this machine. Now the problem has worsened. Ughh!"
3,"So far, Not sooo good","I recieved this mpio mp3 player for my birthday a couple days ago.....i love all the features on it w/ the voice recorder..etc...when i got it i was excited to try it out, i read the instructions, then put the installation disc in the comp. and it wouldnt bring up anything to install the program...i know its compattable wiht my comp, because its a windows ME......well i hope it works, otherwise it is good"
3,Good Sound Quality but BEWARE,"I bought this MP3 player for a friend. It has great sound quality, easy set up, easy use, and it's great for working out. However, after only three weeks of use the face plate on it cracked. It was not due to dropping or mistreatment - it just cracked after a workout! It still plays music but you have to work a little harder at the buttons. I would recommend buying the extended warranty for it."
1,end of life span,"Product is no longer supported. Can't transfer music using Windows media player or Real Networks player. Shame, I liked it."
3,It's not THAT great!,"Everyone gives this top marks - I'm not sure why. I found the sound, particularly the bass, lacking - especially when compared to my run of the mill basic Sony FM/CD portable (I tested each with the same the radio station and the same headphones).I also noticed that the tone settings (which are very flexible, including a 5 band Eq.) didn't seem to work on the radio receiver- I just got the same tinny sound.The manual is really poorly translated, however you can just about figure it out.The Support site is usable but not great - e.g. there are several firmware updates available but no indication is given as to what they actually do... (the english on the site is also very poor.)emails to their support site have all gone unanswered.While the software will run on a Mac (Sys 9+) and iTunes software is included, the player will NOT play songs in the new AAC format that Apple now sells them in from their website (several others"
2,Less than mediocre,"If all you are trying to do is play a couple of CD's on here, you should be ok. I say should because the documentation is somewhat lacking, and is obviously a bad translation job. The web site also sufferes from the same problem. The manager program is exceeding slow to copy music to the device, and there are frequent issues if you simple copy to it using it as a removable disk. Also, it can only access another 512mb of external memory, which is not shown anywhere in any documentation."
3,Poor Service,"I purhased this player in August '03 and after 7 months the unit ""froze"" and would not display or play any files. I called Digitalway Inc tech support and was told to ship to San Diego for service. I waited 2 days for them to email an RMA# and I promptly shipped it on Mar 24, 2004. They asked me to leave inserted my 128MB memory card to aid with diagnosing problem. It is now June 12,2004 and I have not heard from them since mid April when an email reply was answered indicating they would need more time. Another month had passed and I have been trying to reach them both by phone and email since mid May. Their voice prompts say ""Sorry there is no one available to take the call please leave a message"". Several messages left also sent numerous email and have received no reply.At this point I would take the broken player back just to retrieve my memory card. I don't recommend this one. It may freeze after 6 months use. Think I will look into the Apple Ipods."
2,The worst customer service ever.,"I purchased my FL100 a few months ago. The performance was fine, I downloaded a debugged version of their software off the internet.However, I recently went on a business trip and neglected to take along the USB cable that comes with the player. Unfortunately MPIO uses a proprietary cable that I can't seem to find anywhere.When I contacted MPIO Customer Service about ordering a replacement cable, they never got back to me."
3,TV Tale Of Tragedy,"I have to say that this version is interesting, with the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis (the ""Scream Queen""), one of my favorite actresses as Dorothy, although she doesn't bear much of a resemblance. Although I think that Bob Fosse's ""STAR 80"" is better, this version has something good going for it - the inner strength that Dorothy discovers, but she is still unable to save herself. (Maybe the fact that a woman directed it had some influence). Bruce Weitz is overbearing as Snider, but he seems a bit too old. Remember, Paul Snider was 29 when he died. This film's version of events leading up to the crime doesn't quite feel right, but no matter. It's a cut above a lot of other TV movies. But if you want something closer to the real story, watch ""STAR 80"". This one will do, though."
4,You should be payin me...,"...or THEM rather.Dolemite, in it's purest form, is certainly a movie worthy of anyone's attention. Whether you watch it for the ""skull splitting, brain blasting action"" or for its intellegent and insightful look into the life of a classy pimp in today's cutting-edge empire of prostitution, Dolemite is of a calibur that hasn't been matched since Max Julien's brilliant interpretation of the ""Pimp of the Year"" himself, Goldie ""The Mack"". While Dolemite may not have the finesse of an 80's action hero, such as Malone (played by Burt Reynolds in the brilliant epic directed by Harry Cokliss), without a doubt, his actions illustrate the raw charisma and leadership demanded of a first-class pimp. The fact that Burt Reynolds did not appear in the movie seriously decreased the value of the film. However, as it is highly unlikely that Burt Reynolds would appear in a blaxploitation film, I will bear this in mind while rating this movie."
2,"OK, but didn't last long","My kids liked the toy. We replaced the batteries once. When it quit working again, new batteries didn't solve the problem. It's just... dead. So, I'd say that it's cute and fun, but not very durable."
4,"fun and easy, a little loud","The remote is large and durable. It has two buttons, forward and spin, that are labeled with arrows. I bought it for my daughter, who is not quite 3. She is able to control it easily and her older brother (5) has had some fun with it as well. My only complaint is that it is a little louder than it needs to be. It makes motor and horn sounds constantly, which is okay since the kids like it, but the one controlling the bus is always close enough to watch it and you can hear the sound effects three rooms away. The bus takes 3 AA batteries and the remote one 9V."
4,bus,"2 yr old loves it's holding up well, since their favorite thing is to watch it ride off the coffee tableit's soft plastic, not hard so it's nice for little ones"
1,Horrible customer service,"Not worth the hassle!! I bought this juicer and less than a month later the motor blew....when I called cutomer service the guy told me to THROW IT OUT...and he would send me another one. Lucky for me Im not stupid! I called 15 days later, after never recieving ANYTHING from them, and here the guy never put another replacement order through! The second customer service rep. told me I had to ship the dead juicer back for a refund and she sent me a return slip, I waited another 15 days and again, nothing showed up at my door. Just got off the phone again, with a very unfriendly woman who put yet ANOTHER return slip in the mail to me, and here I sit. So please ladies and gent's, save yourself the hassle!!"
4,juicing,"I bought this for my parents because of gastrointestinal health problems. I've used mine for the last 6 months. I lost alot of weight and feel great. Because the mouth is big, don't have to spend alot of time cutting veggies to fit as all the old juicers require."
3,"Well, you do get juice","I purchased this item at the local discount store as it was the same price as on Amazon. This is my first juicer, and I did not want to spend a lot of money, but did not want to buy a piece of junk either.My biggest complaint is cleaning the juicer--there is no way I will make juice more than once a day after taking the entire juicer apart and cleaning all of the pulp out of this thing! It does clean fairly easy, with the exception of the screen, but is just a bit cumbersome.I find that alternating softer fruits with harder ones seems to prevent clogging. I make my juice about two times a week in large amounts just to avoid dealing with the clean-up as I just don't have the time. The unit does do well in the dishwasher."
1,Breaks and then breaks again,"The motor is supposed to have a lifetime warranty.... but the company makes you pay $40 for shipping, which is too much. It could even be ok if it did not keep breaking, but within a year I have had to pay more than the juicer. On top of that, they sent me the wrong model, and the experience has been awful. I do not recommend this product because of the terrible after sale customer service."
1,cracked plastic screw,"I too have a worthless juicer from this company, it was used maybe 50 times in the year and a half I have owned it. I have several juicers in my basement, that were used a 1000 times or so and still work. I bought this juicer because of the larger feed tube which my old juicer didn't have. The warranty is a joke because at $30 plus shipping they are making a fortune on a part that cost them less then a dollar! If that screw on the LaLanne juicer hasn't cracked yet don't worry it will, that's part of the built in failure they have designed in a plastic fitting which holds the spinning blade. I will inspect the next juicer I buy to make sure it is made for more than 50 uses!"
3,Not as strong as Jack,"Although this is a reasonably priced machine, it is wimpy. It bogs down easily and the pulp is still very wet after juicing has occurred. The hopper is designed for large pieces, but the machine itself needs small pieces and slow feeding to be at its best."
1,FLAWED BY DESIGN!,"I have owned this piece of garbage for a few years now. The reason I had it for so long is that I haven't used it much, since it is a nightmare.The machine was poorly designed to begin with. The grinding plate brings everything to its center, where the speed is much lower and there are are just a few grinding teeth. You have to really struggle to get some juice.The feeding tube should guide the fruits/vegetables toward the outer part of the plate, and prevent them from accessing the center, which should not be visible through the feeding tube.It is practically impossible to get juice out of a carrot, celery stick, or anything of similar shape.Just watch this YouTube video and see for yourself. They cut short the part where the woman tries to run a carrot through the juicer, guess why?[...]"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUICER !!!,"Four hours after I bought this Juicer from Target, it burn't out while I was blending blueberries. It is cheap and contains alot of plastic parts. So I took it back and bought a Hamilton Beach Juicer from Wal-Mart - this juicer was Not Only more powerful and is made of stronger materials but only cost me $60 dollars, so it saved me money too. Check out this blender. Hamilton really knew what they were doing when they made there blender. The Jack La Lane one is all Hype don't believe the advertisements...."
2,Product doesn't last!!!,"When the juicer is working, it does make great juice. We are on our second juicer is less than two years. The first juicer the piece that the blade screws on broke, once that breaks you are done. Went out and bought another juicer that night and not even a year later the same piece broke on our second machine. Very frustrating because everything is made of plastic. Have to screw on blade tightly for top of juicer to fit properly. Love the concept of juicing fresh fruit, but won't buy another Jake Lalanne juicer, not worth the time or money!!"
4,You CAN get what you pay for!,"When I bought this juicer I thought to myself.....""you get what you pay for..."" However, I was surprised! This juicer works like it claims it would and makes delicious juice. The price is right, it is user friendly, AND it makes juice without having to remove skin. Cleanup, if done immediately, is simple with warm water. Small pieces get stuck so cutting larger pieces saves time. I would recommend this juicer to anyone who does NOT want to spend a lot of money but wants delicious juices.J.R. Eastsound, WA."
4,Great Item if you have a family,"I found the juicer easy to use and easy to take apart. BUT I am single and did not find it worth my time to make juice. It took 3 regular size oranges to make 12 oz of juice. To use it daily you have to let it set out, it is a big bulky item that takes up counter space. I do however recommend the use of the machine for a family of 2 or more. Just plan on stocking up on a ton of fruits and veggies to get few glasses of juice."
1,Let me tell you bluntly....,"It sucks...it juices apples and oranges fairly well. HOWEVER, it leaks, it does not juice leafy greens, forget trying to juice any of those. It doesnt juice like they claim, the pulp is DRIPPING wet, and I just wasted my time with it."
1,Broken plastic screww,"I received this juicer as a gift. The fourth time I used it, the plastic(??!) screw that holds the blase cracked and now it is useless. I would expect better quality for the price. This seems to be a common problem and a design flaw that hasn't yet been fixed.I am better off using my old, cheapy juicer that I bought for $2 at a garage sale and have used for the past 6 years. I'm so glad I didn't get rid of it."
3,Jack LaLanne Power Juicer,"I'm a bit disappointed. I had not been aware that you must drink the juice immediately. Also, it didn't completely pulverize the apples. While it is very easy to clean and assemble, it just seems quite a bit of trouble and expense for one glass that must be drunk immediately."
1,Don't Buy It - Potential to Explode,"This juicer works well for the price, but recent research has shown that it can explode...if overworked. I use it every day and will get rid of immediately. There are many others in the same price range that are safer. I am not sure if this has to do with new manufacturing off land. I know that when you call the company you can reach someone in India. Also, their email address is invalid so any concerns can not be sent via email. Don't bother, this thing is dangerous."
4,"Great juicer, but SO many parts!","I've had one of these for a couple of years.I like it and love the juice it makes, but I don't like all the parts. Don't lose any of them or you're screwed, especially that blade unlock tool. And clean all the parts (10-15 of them) before enjoying your juice or there will be lots of dried on messes. Then WAIT don't enjoy the juice yet. First re-assemble all the parts of the juicer NOW while you remember where everything goes otherwise you might not be able to get the thing back together later. It's almost not worth all the clean up trouble unless you are making a lot of juice. For one glass? No.But yeah you can throw whole fruits and veggies down that big opening and it grinds 'em right up. I line the pulp bucket poop-chute thing with a plastic bag so it can be tossed out without washing the chute. That HELPS with the clean up."
1,VERY BAD,WHEN I CONNECT IT TO THE POWER IT BURN immediatly. IT SEEMS IT DOES NOT HAVE AN AUTO VOLTAGE SELLECTOR INSIDE IT WHICH MEAN IT IS A VERY BAD QUALITY I LOST MY MONEY LIKE ANY THING
3,OK Jack..........,"It is quiet. It can juice well. It is not fun to clean.You have to buy the recipe book, shame on you Jack.3 out of 5 stars, and that is being nice."
2,"motor runs randomly, can't figure out what's wrong","I will give it 5 stars for juicer functionality, but two start for motor operation. This juicer ran fine first year. Now when I try to assemble all the fruits and ready to juice, the motor does not run fast. I can hear the sligt noise like the motor is trying to run, but it can't run fast to the full speed. After some manouvering, disassembling, assembling, then on/off, the juicer will run and do it's job. But, I am very disappointed, then when I want to make juice, the motor just doesn't run. It ruins my excitement of making the juice. I would say that the machine is very good when it runs, but it is highly unreliable."
1,Jack Lalanne Juicer,"I purchased the juicer based on information obtained in an informercial. After 3 weeks the motor died and I assumed that I would get satisfaction from the life time warranty they advertised. Upon reading the fine I discoverd it was very misleading. In order to enforce the warranty you must pack the juicer and ship it accross country at your expense. You must also include a $29.00 check with returned product and the recipient would notify you how they will proceed. In essence, this so-called life time warranty requires that you spend over 30% of the purchase price of the item without guarantee that they will either provide you a new juicer. I thus proceeded to place the juicer where it belongs, in the garbage. I have been a big fan of Jack Lalanne since I was a child. I was very disappointed to find that he has allowed his name to be used by scam artists. I purchased a new juicer at a much lower price and better quality. Needless to say, I do not recommend the Jack Lalanne juicer."
1,Crap,"Wastes most of your fruit. Claims to leave very little pulp because it gets more juice than other machines. What it actually does is keep the pulp - much of it not even pulverized - inside the juicing area instead of throwing it out into the handy pulp bin that comes with it. This way you get to clean it so much more often. There is always more pulp inside the juicing area than in the waste pulp bin - WAY more. And it's very wet, juicy pulp, which means maybe half the juice got extracted."
2,Broke after the first use; company has poor communication,"I had been wanting this juicer for a long time. When I finally bought it, I used it once and it worked great. The next time I tried to use it, the blade wouldn't spin. It was almost like it was stuck. I then sent it to the company under the warranty; however, they haven't communicated with me regarding the repair. I had to send them a check for the repair work, which they immediately cashed. It has now been two months since they cashed the check and I haven't received my repaired item or heard about the status of my juicer. I am frustrated.When it did work, it was great. However, there are a lot of parts to clean between each use (even if you only use it once!)."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was a little worried about what the condition of this book would actually be like, but it was better than I had expected.I am very happy with my purchase and I saved over $50 compared to other classmates who bought used."
4,Ok for the money,"The picture is very good with cable hd and dvd (both progressive scan and analog component hooked up to AV1). Only one digital input allowed. This is a problem if you have two devices, such as cable box and dvd. However, the digital input only accepts vga or hdmi, so all component feeds must be converted to vga with cable supplied by manufacturer. I think that one could get an analog switcher with video component input and outputs for not too much money. The picture quality degrades with analog signals, even over digital cable. On middle brightness settings, shading and details in dark areas are lost. Correction by increasing the brightness helps to a limited degree, however, you start to lose the deepness of the black and get graying/hazing. There are better LCD TV's out there with better pitcures and two digital inputs, however, they cost a lot more."
5,Just gets better with time.,"Aaaah, the Whispers. What can one say? This has all the best Whispers cuts--from the ultra dramatic ""Only Meant to Wet My Feet"" to the Playa's Anthem, ""Olivia (Lost And Turned Out), to the sentimental favorite, ""Lady""--and so much more. Get it for you and your lady today."
3,Please get a decent piano,"The beautiful playing is marred by an out-of-tune piano with half the dampers not working. The studio should hang its head in shame. Joan, do yourself a favour, you deserve better!"
2,Lingo Voyager 3 Talking Translator (TTV-3),I would not recommned to buy the Lingo if you are selecting it because it has speaking capability. It is very hard to understand the person speaking the translation. Recently I went to Brazil and used it to translate English to Portuguese. When I played thr translation I desitred I could not understand the translation. So I let the local people I work with in Brazil listen to it and they could not understand it.Otherwise the word translations worked fine.
1,Organic? May be. Safe? No!,"They package their product in plastic containers while boiling hot. Does ""organic"" make sense after that?"
1,Horiible,"Recieved this product today and it was not like the picture. Instead of being solid gold it was replaced blues,purples,green and even burnt brown. I cant believe this is what i purchased. When i called to explain they were not even sorry for sending something so different from the above pictures. Never again will i order from Palm Beach Jewlery."
3,Classic book,This is an important book of archaeology that defies lies about the history of Palestine. Any shortsighted approach based on falsifying history for the sake of cheap political gains can easily be rebuffed by scientific books of this nature.
5,works great,was able to use this fora ll my stuff at track and only had to bring 1 tank awsome piece.
5,Excellent cookbook!,"This book has lots of totally simple yet unbelievably low-fat recipes that are delicious. It's full of useful information about nutrition and diet as well. It's so easy to get the actual brand name items mentioned. She compares the fat in the finished meal to the traditional version of that same meal. The difference of fat grams is amazing, yet the food tastes absolutely delicious"
1,BlowHard,"Egomanical, self-centered old man discusses how he lies to other lawyers and tries to get an edge by serving papers on opponents when he knows that they are suffering personal problems. Had he simply reprinted the cover page ... a photo of himself ... on every page in the inside I suspect that the book would have been as useful to both him and to the rest of us as it is in its present state."
1,The Romans Do What???,"Having lived in Rome for several years as an American expat, I am constantly being asked about guide books and have read all of them. And Rick Steves is really the worst ever! It is the perfect guidebook for the single digit IQ teen on the ""Do Europe"" thang, but when I actually lived there after having bought this wretched tome and studied classics and art there, I realised how much of this book is just American stereotypes of a few days spent in tourist traps in the Eternal City. And Rome does not have good food? Rick, either your palate is as dumb as stone or you need to live with the Romans for a while and get nice and fat like those of us who came as skinny American kids and matured into solid young men under the Roman sun."
4,A user......,"A passionate writer and her passages on discovering her erotic nature are moving and insightfull. This is the best of the reissue of her diaries...although there are times when Nin doth protest too much about her desire to love. Check out the next book ""Incest"" or any of the biographies to see her real never faced fears......"
5,my favorite book,"this reads like really good fiction...Anais opens up and analyzes everyday life to death....expresses emotions that everyone can relate to...as well as daring, very strange, and exciting situations in her life. very sensual....very deep views of relationships...very optimistic..never EVER DULL...always at maximum pitch"
5,A comprehensive and sane look at law school,"This book provides a realistic look at all things law school: the application process, LSAT, rankings, finances, acceptance, rejection, and what to expect for the three years of law school. While targeted to non-trads, it seems like it would also be helpful for the traditional student who wants a no-nonsense view of law school and the profession."
1,Virtually useless book,"This book is so generic in its advice that it is all but useless. It tries to be all things to all cameras, and therefore says nothing specific about anything. Add to this the way it tries to tout Kodak film, and you realize Kodak should be paying people to read this book. But they still wouldn't know how to work their cameras."
3,Its all about the fit,I used this product with the 3-tab Ford adapter on a E150 van and it worked perfectly. I tried to use it on my 2010 Ford Fusion and the adapter would not fit. No clear explanation was given although website and customer service tried. It just does not fit the Fusion master cylinder. This is a popular car and so I hope they make an adapter to fit it in the near future.
5,The Best Of The Darling Boys,"If you were an Andy Griffith fan you knew that the music was great, but I was really surprised over this cd. It is wonderful, the music, the vocal and the songs are A+. I am so glad I ordered it and will order the others that are out also. You will not be disappointed."
5,Top achievers speak from the heart,Take a Lesson is a great book for people of all ages. It is a collection of advice from all the people I have grown to admire. In this book they are not putting on a professional face. They are telling the truth about how they struggled in their lives and businesses; and how they won out. I read one every day for inspiration.
2,Asking Too Much,"I read this book when it came out. I found it boring, flat, and not believable in any way. The premise was unoriginal, the execution blah. I skimmed it just to finish it. Such a disappointment after Levin's fantastic ""A Kiss Before Dying."""
2,It wasn't very good.,"Although the book was intriguing at times, the story deteriorated into absurdity with the ending and denouement. However, everyone else seems to like it, so if one likes horror, one would probably enjoy this book or if one is a from a Western religion, he may find more horror in it."
3,disappointing return to a 60's read,I recall reading this in the 60's. I remember it as fresh and the book was a fast read. Today it boringly prods along and the end was welcome.
5,Rosemary's Baby,I loved the book. I saw the movie years ago when it came out but had forgotten a lot of it. The book was good reading and kept me on the edge of my chair. I was very surprised at the ending--I didn't remember it from the movie!!!
3,"Ifthenoveltoldthetruth,IraLevinwouldfailasanauthor","There's no doubt about the excitement the book creates. Whilst reading the novel you'll get certain ""clues"" about what's going to happen, which indeed make the reader curious! Honestly, I enjoyed reading the book 'cause the novel provokes the reader and it's hard to put it down. Still after having read the whole book I was dissapointed. It wasn't scary at all. If you compare this novel with a novel written by Edgar A. Poe or Mary Higgins Clark, you won't think Rosemary's baby is creepy nor realistic! And Rosemary's character doesn't develop at all! What pisses me off a bit is that her character is so extremely silly and naive! How goofy & wrong can one person be? So I guess the theme must be: NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF HUMAN STUPIDITY!!! Advice: if you like spiritualism, read the book! You'll learn a lot!!!"
2,completely anticlimactic!,"For so many years, I have heard references to Rosemary's Baby. Not knowing exactly what the ""baby"" was, I finally decided to read the book. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Not only was it poorly written, but it isn't very suspenseful. You know what's going to happen from the beginning. I won't ruin it for those of you who haven't read it, but don't expect much."
5,A Creepy Novel,"As soon as I opened the novel, I didn't want to stop reading. Levin's choice of words makes it easy for the reader to get caught up in the story and also feel like one of the characters. Levin's work is packed with darkness and mystery in an ambiguous world of an expectant mother, so this might not be your best choice of literature if you are pregnant. The novel is infused with a great deal of suspense and as the story unveils, the reader gets a better sense of who might be using her and why. It is very descriptive and it provides the reader with a great vivid visual from Rosemary's perspective. This novel would be perfect for someone who enjoys horror and suspense, without all the blood. Rosemary's Baby, is by far one of the best horror novels I've ever read."
4,REALLY GOOD!,"I think the reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because I thought it was going to be scary....it wasnt. However it was polished just enough to where you COULDN'T put it down! It was very easy to follow and most of the time as you went along, you start to visualize what is happening! It isnt scary...but it is very creepy...you just want to leap out and say ""Rosemary, get it through that thick head of yours, YOUR IN DEEP TROUBLE!!"" This is a perfect book for reading when your in a mellow mood because it created a creepy little twist, but not to the point where your parinoid. Very good!"
2,Herky- jerky reading,Unfortuantely the book isn't as good as it's catchy title. As with most books in this category the ideas could have been expressed in 1/2 the pages. The writing is herky-jerky in both structure and concepts. The editor should have provided a little more guidance on how to structure sentences.
3,Plate Tectonics,"This book discusses the theory of plate tectonics and how it connects to volcanic and earthquake activity. It gives the history of how the plate tectonic theory evolved and includes many small pictures and diagrams. Relevant and interesting examples are provided in boxed areas, but a few boxed areas that appear in the middle of pages are distracting. At times I was wishing for diagrams of things being discussed in the text while the page included a diagram or photo of something else. Overall, an informative discussion."
2,"Unless you seriously need the features, get an iPod or Zen Touch","I do have to say the sound quality is good, the FM tuner, FM recording, and voice recording features are nice. But there are a few bad issues that weren't mentioned. This players freezes like crazy, and I had returned two units for freezing problems (one during saving a recording and one for displaying the artist names in Chinese and then freezing). The firmware, even with the newest, is somewhat buggy. Windows Media Player 10 is a bad software to use for this player, it is slow, freezes, and syncs slowly. Overall unless you desperately need an FM tuner I would get an iPod or a Touch."
1,3 of 3 I've seen are garbage.,"I own this, and 2 of my friends own them. They seemed like a great deal 2 years ago, better than the ipod of the time. 3 out of 3 are now almost useless. huge problems uploading files. huge problems with hardware. huge problems with sound and playback.Buy an ipod. apple knows what they are doing"
1,Horrible - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have had this product for 9 months and it has not worked properly for 8 months. I have had one ""return to company and they will fix it"" and it came back worse than when it started. It would not play half of the songs I downloaded, even with the suggested low bit rate change per the company. I have to reset it to switch songs, to turn it off, to turn it on - basically to perform any function. I can only get customer service via their website, and it has been a never ending ""have you tried....."" despite the blatant fact that it should work the first time, simply, without a lot of reformatting and resetting.I bought this product for sound quality as well as being anti-Ipod. Now I will spend the money for an Ipod and count the cash I lost as a lesson - products don't sell by the millions if they don't work (Ipod vs. Iriver)."
1,"Problems, problems---why didn't I buy an iPod?","I am on my second one of these. The first locked up after a couple of weeks; now this one refuses to communicate with my computer, and songs are frequently distorting by their second half. I have a two year replacement warranty on this little lemon; hopefully I can replace it with an iPod.I have to strongly suggest avoiding this unit."
3,Slow !,"It takes too long to load songs into this product.It took me all of two months to load 500 songs into this device as opposed to 2 days on a new Sansa MP3 player I purchased recently.About 2yrs after purchase,the battery lost its' capacity to hold charge.When fully charged,it lasted 90 minutes as opposed to 9hrs when new.Other than these problems,this MP3 player is very durable.I remember it falling to the ground from about 4ft twice without malfunctioning.It finally died completely when it accidentally came in contact with water that got sprayed on the strip on its' front.Overall,I give this product a B-."
3,Not for Mix CDs,"I accidentally purchased this without inquiring how large the silence gaps between songs were. Unfortunately, if you like to listen to mix CDs (mixed by DJs) you should steer clear of the iRiver H10. I'll admit that the break will vary-- sometimes its only a fraction of a second, but other times it can be 2-3 seconds. The interruption in mix CDs can be uncomfortable.Unfortunately most companies do not list ""gapless playback"" as a feature so you have to find out by word of mouth.For the record, my old Creative Zen Touch 20GB had almost perfectly gapless playback; the gaps were only a fraction of a second all the time. This would leave me to believe that later units from Creative are similar, but I can't say for sure.Other than the gaps between songs, I found this device to sound excellent, I love the style, design, & controls, and it is quite light."
1,Compatability issues,I'm an experienced techie and was unable to get this device to be detected by my laptop or Windows Media Player. Research brought me to an iRiver enthusiasts site where I found approximately 20 other people were having the exact same problem and giving up and returning the devices.
4,Scared but Happy,"When I decided that I was going to buy an MP3 player, it took a lot of thought and consideration. I'm a poor college kid, so the fact that this player was so reasonably priced was definitely what initially drew me to this one. But once I started reading the reviews, I started getting a little freaked out. I decided that I would get it anyways, and I love it! It has frozen on me once, but that's a complete human error. I haven't had any other problems than that, and I think I did really good by purchasing this!"
4,Iriver H10,"i've had this for a little over a year now, and i love it. the 1st 1 i got broke, and it was a pain trying 2 understand the people in tech support or w/e. but i finally got a guy that i could understand, and they replaced it no questions asked. the 2nd 1 i got works like a charm. i've only got about 1500 songs, but i plan on using all the storage space, lol. but when it says 20GB, it means it. i would give this a 5, but i try carrying this around at school, and teachers always think i have a pack of cigarettes, in other words, its bulky. but i really like it, and i plan on buying some more stuff from this company if need be. other than tech sepport, its a good company. and 2 all the ppl who give this bad reviews, just go get a damn ipod and shut up"
1,Disappointing,Does not have the flavour or ambiance of the Babar books written by the original author.
1,Written for C++ developers.,I wish one reviewer would have stated the obvious:This book is written for C++ developers (the author states this on page 92). If you are trying to write a program using anything like Visual Basic this book might as well have been written in Japanese. The main example developed throughout the book is in C++. 99% of the book is C++. VB is only mentioned as an afterthought and developing using VB as a primary platform is not explained AT ALL! It looks like it could be a good book for C++ developers but I wouldn't know since I am not one. If you want to learn to develop programs for handheld devices using VB forget this book or learn C++ before you buy it.
2,The content shouldn't be for children.,"If you don't mind your children reading a book that contains nudists or contains children, in essence, worshipping a sea creature, and so on... then this book is for you. Otherwise, just find another book."
2,leaves sharp nails,"The clipper cuts quickly and my morkie didn't complain too much, however, I found that he was left with REALLY sharp nails - so sharp that he drew blood when he jumped up on my 6 yr old and drew blood. I had to go and file his nails down after that - not a pleasant task., for me or the dog.Also, it has a nail guard, supposedly to prevent overclipping, but you can't see it when you;re cutting, so you're still guestimating. I should have saved my money and dug out my dremel."
5,new fan,"I saw Dave Hawkins perform at the Queen's University Festival in Belfast November 2001. He was on Tommy Sands' Country Ceili radio show. After hearing him perform his song ""O'Reilly"" with his Fiddler Peg O'Callan I bought his Celtic Core Live CD. I've just received my copy of HOTEL DEVILLE and am thrilled! From the opening track ""Celtic to the Core"" to the final cut ""Seems Like A Long Time"" (with the kids choir). I can understand why everyone from Sam Bush to Joanie Madden wants to work with him... HE'S GREAT!"
4,Great Product,"My Border Collie mix 7 month old puppy loved these treats. I used them for training and playing games with my puppy like ""find the treat"". I would order these again but I've switched my pup to Pup Corn treats made locally, cheaper and healthier too but still eats milk bone biscuits. The free I.d tag is promotional is a pretty good deal and I plan to order Oreo one."
1,HAVE NOT RECEIVED ITEM AFTER BEING CHARGED FOR IT!!!!,"I was charged for the Anchor Hocking bakeware set in October, and have yet to receive it, over a month after the payment was processed. PLEASE confirm shipment immediately, or refund my payment.Thank you,Leslie Fraser"
2,"Not a ""truthful"" representation of the story","I bought this book to teach my children about honesty since Pinocchio's nose grows every time he lies.... Or so I thought. There is not one mention of lying or his nose growing anywhere in the book, so the purpose of my purchase was lost. Instead, it goes on about other parts of the pinocchio story. A nice story, but if you are looking to teach children about values, honesty and lying, this is not the right book for you."
3,not my favorite,"this book, although i liked the movie, i didnt really care for the book, because it doesnt interest me as much as the movie, although the characters are the same, and the book is told the same,it just doesnt help me picture the action, like the movie does"
2,Let's be real. This album is pretty below average.,"Don't get me wrong.. I got sucked in by Daylight too.. but the fact is.. Aesop Rock is NOT Canibus. His lyrics DO NOT make sense.. his lyrics have never made any cohesive sense for more than two bars at a time.The only songs even remotely worth keeping on this album are No Regrets, which is actually surprisingly well written, the excellent Daylight, and 9-5er's Anthem which is also average.Check out Bazooka Tooth, it's Aesop's most well-produced and written album."
4,"So far, so good!",I only rated this a 4 because the baby is not born yet (3 weeks to go!). My rating is based on observations so far. My husband and I spent weeks researching and picking out a stroller and car seat. We both agreed that this stroller along with the Peg Perego car seat were the way to go. One of the selling points was ease of opening and closing and how light it is. I have seen several people with this stroller and all have agreed how wonderful it is. We also had no problem assembling the product when it came. Directions were easy to follow and Pegs Customer Service department is very helpful with any questions. Car seat locks in perfectly with this system.
3,Nice Read,"When Nick and Lisa's infant daughter dies, their marriage collapses. Years later, Lisa's about to remarry when her best friend (and Nick's sister) begs Lisa to come home and keep her children. Maggie thinks her husband is alive and needs time to chase down her suspicions.Lisa owes Maggie and Maggie assures her she's tried Nick and he's out of town. So for the weekend, Lisa babysits.Of course Nick shows up and the embers blaze up. Still, Lisa hangs on because Maggie'll be back soon. Only Maggie's search for her maybe-not-dead husband is taking her longer than she expected. And she's picked up a gallant helper who happens to be pretty darned cute.Very nice writing and a good story."
5,Beautiful book,"I usually prefer family centered books rather than full on romance novels, but this book I have to say was wonderful. It was very moving and made me cry, which I rarely do when reading a novel. This is a beautiful novel and would highly recommend it. I got it for free but would have gladly paid money for it, if I had to do it again. Barbara Freethy is becoming one of my favorite authors!"
5,Excellent book,"What a great love story this was to read....couldn't put the book down. And when I did, was anxious to continue reading it. You know what she needs to do, but she is so scared, after what she has been through. Loved the book, did have some typo errors though, no big deal!"
4,~ Barbara Freethy always writes an interesting story ~,You can count on Barbara for creating a beautiful story which emotionally involves the reader from the very first page. Her ability to maintain a storyline that keeps the reader guessing is remarkable.
3,Okay for the price,I was not a big fan of this book until the end. I had to force myself to keep reading it. This book was just not that great. It starts off very slow and stays slow until the last 2 chapters.
4,Great Read!,...Except for the numerous typos in the Kindle version...so many that it was very distracting. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and will purchase other titles by this author. I hope the editing/typesetting is better though!!!
3,Sweet story but nothing special,"I enjoyed the story but was sooo drawn out, especially near the end. I truly felt for their pain and cannot imagine the heartbreak of losing a child. However, I just had a hard time with the continuous back and forth between the couple - spoiler alert - they're practically having sex and then seconds later, she is going back to her fiance...got a little old after it continued to happen. Also, the whole story line with the sister was not believable - I understand being an overwhelmed mother but to disappear for a week, etc, etc and happen to have a man (an extremely handsome one at that), fall madly in love with you - yeah, right. So, it was a nice easy read but nothing that I'll remember for any length of time...just OK."
1,Used this hose for 1 year then it quit working..,"We used this hose on our Roadmate grill about 12 times over the past year. It worked just fine but then it just quit passing gas. Took it to a local gas shop and they say it is not fixable, must replace the end fittings due to corroded safety device or buy a new one. using it 12 times is not a good value..Note of caution for other owners. Make sure to always bring along a portable tank so you will be able to continue cooking when the hose fails.."
2,2yrs and failed,"Purchased this item in 2007 and all was great. Used for tailgating at football games, BBQ's, camping etc. One time and during a football game, the flame would not stay lit. As if there was something clogging the hose. When disconnecting after it failed, there was pressure built into the hose. I called the manufacturer and they did not help.Happen to anyone else?"
5,Works with Coleman products too.,I bought this so I wouldn't have to keep buying the throw away 1lb propane containers. I use this with my 5lb refillable propane tank which gives me hours upon hours of burn time. It will of course work with 20lb propane containers but those are just too heavy and bulky for a long weekend trip. Go for it.
1,Non-scientists Pontificate About Science,"This book is the result of a non-scientist, unencumbered by the requisite knowledge of the nature of scientific truth, pontificating about the details of a complex biological phenomenon--Darwinian evolution. It would be no less absurd for me--as a biological scientist--to write a book on constitutional law or astrophysics. Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory, and this fact is not changed no matter how many people claim that it is. As a committed, liberal Christian, I find it very sad that the Intelligent Design crowd spends so much time, energy, and money trying to prove the existence of God, while countless numbers of their fellow humans remain hungry, naked, and homeless. Jesus must weep at the sorry spectacle."
3,Cool book,Its a nice book to read. Has some interesting facts but most of these are stuff i knew already so it was not too captivating
1,Digital Flatus,Morse code transduced computer synthesized jerks and seizures on a bed of groaning digital flatus. . No part ambient. . No part experimental. . Not minimalism. . Not interesting. . An utter failure in all regards.
1,Piece of Junk,"I only had this humidifier for a few weeks when the tank cracked while I was filling it up with water. I called Holmes and they said they didn't have the replacement part but said they would be happy to sell me a new one, of the same model for a discount. Don't waste your money!"
2,Very discouraging,"First, let me say that the content of this book is very good and in-depth. However, it is written from a point of view that is highly discouraging of you doing any of it yourself. Basically, if you want a patent, here are the steps, but you better hire a patent attorney to do it or it will be messed up. This is not the case - someone who does not do patents for a living, but is willing to do the research and make the effort, can file a patent that will provide all the protection available to their invention. That being said, if the point of view does not matter to you, this is a very good overview and introduction to the patent process."
3,Great start limps to conclusion,"I reviewed the first book on this site and had great hope for Laura Resnick but commented on her lack of character development.The last two books that could have just as easily been one volume if they had done some serious editing, did not correct that first volume deficiency.It could be a great movie if all three volumes are used as a single script but they will still have to hire a screen writer with character building expertise."
5,This is Alan Watts in his prime.,"That's all you need to know. If the forces of the universe brought your attention to this book then buy it, enough said.Enjoy :)"
5,what they said and more,"rubbermaid hit the mark with this cart. i work maintanance, this is my work cart. the raised handle is a back saver if your tall (over 6 ft). sturdy, solid wheels, pockets for small tools and such. the V grove is great for steading things that need to be cut. worth every cent."
4,"""La más sureña"" never ceases to evolve","Great, modern album by the Sonora! ""Fea"", No Vale la Pena"" and ""Percusión"" are definitely an example of where ""La Ponceña"" are headed in the next years. Pure Salsa sophistication. Since the 1970's this group has never ceased to amaze me. However, it's not a set of non-stop fascinating tracks like their previous albums had."
4,Spiritual Technology of the Highest Degree,"An amazing book that describes all the possible scenarios earth has been through, and will go through, according to each individual's choice: do we choose to own our feelings and emotions and rise above negativity in order to help earth shift, and evolve with it? Or do we continue to refuse to change when change is unavoidable, then choosing the path of ""devolution""? Powerful book; it will shake your foundations by making you think ""multidimensionally.It takes a very special mind to read through the whole book, including the updates, and stay with it. The technical words alone are really quite out there, although intuitively you know that it makes sense!I personally have highlighted lots of terms, which I intend to google and research further, because one can't simply read this book superficially and hope to have grasped the inmensity of the historical records that it describes."
5,Excellent Source Of Information!!!,"As a fellow contactee I have found this to be some of the most valuable, clearest, and concise information in current literature.It's understandable that most will find her books hard to comprehend if you don't have actual experience in these fields.But I can honestly tell you based upon my own personal experiences and comparing it with various other comprehensive sources that this book rings true in brilliantly detailed ways.This book has really helped me with a number of issues. I can't wait to read Voyagers II!!!"
3,Same Problem Here,"I like the liner, and it really does stay on all day -- love that! -- but the sharpening issue is a mystery to me too. I've used it only three times now, and already it seems to need some kind of resurfacing/sharpening, but I don't know how to do that. The packaging kind of concealed the fact that this would be a problem, as you don't know an ordinary sharpener won't work until the liner has been unwrapped. I don't want to have to buy a special sharpener I wasn't told about beforehand, either!"
3,Sturdy but NOT worth the money,"I, like others, registered for this item because it had everything I needed in 1 convenient, STURDY, package. My son is now 4 months old and I've discovered that the only items in this case worth having are the hairbrush, comb, nail clippers, and tooth brush. Thermometer is WORTHLESS, doesn't beep, and is hard to read. The magnifying glasses distort and actually make it harder to see, NOT easier. Pulling the stopper on the medicine dispenser is like pulling teeth. I don't have any problem opening the case one handed, but it's really hard to close it because several of the items continuously fall out of their slots. Save your money and buy your favorite items seperately and buy a little travel makeup bag to hold them in."
3,Entertaining but didn't knock my socks off,"I must admit, the story line, the characters were entertaining. Some surprises thrown in from time to time. But overall, I'd wait until you can get a second hand copy. It's ok but not as captivating as a Madeline Baker or Katherine Kincaid book."
2,One hit wonder CD,"Sorry to be the dissenting opinion here, but this CD is very contradicting. The title cut, as everyone else has stated, is fabulous. But the nicest thing I can say about the rest of the CD is that it is very ordinary. Nothing else is going to jump out at you. So, if the title cut alone is worth the purchase price to you, as it was to me, go for it and have a merry Christmas!"
3,a mixed bag,"When I first heard ""all I want for Christmas is you"" I stopped what I was doing, I could not get over that voice. A friend called the radio station, i got the album name, to buy it. I contacted vince vance & the valiants web page to find out who sang the song ""lisa layne"". four songs on the cd is to my liking, but the cd is worth the money. We all know how great the song ""all I want for Christmas is you"" is, but you guys should compare it to lisa layne's cd ""shades of blue"". vince vance & the valiants cd may have the best cut between cd's but ""shades of blue"" is the better cd overall. you need both. I listen to ""shades of blue"" and finish with her two songs from the v,v&v cd. Just amazing. How is it, someone with that voice isn't a big name in country music."
5,awesome,really love the cd.was fortunate enough to see lisa layne do all i want for c-mas in person in branson mo.
1,Warped bowl,The packaging was intact but the bowl was oval. It had been warped at some point so it had a crease in it. I had to return it the next day.
1,What a piece of JUNK!!,"Gads. This thing looks way cool, and it sounds way cool, but IT'S NOT. The pieces started falling off while taking it out of the package. I snapped legs back on and the head fell off. Put the head on and the arms fell off. It is so flimsy we couldn't get it into any other shape without losing parts. Within two days it was in the trash. What a waste of money!"
5,Great product!,"I choose this rating, because of the age of the figure, and how well it has been taken care of. I recommend this product to all action figure collectors."
4,Decent,Arrrived early and was in good shape.The top has to be put on which was a little tough but a bit of elbow grease got it in.Its being holding wine just fine all week.Note: If you have wine in the lower rack theres not enough room to have standing bottles of alcohol on the bottom shelf.
4,4 Stars! Very Solid Album From Dallas Rappers!,"As others have stated PPT are three rappers representing for Dallas, Texas. They present a nice balance for the heavy street rap that has been coming out of Dallas lately. I dig street rap too, but having a nice balance is good too.This CD is a concept album really with the crew talking about women and love and love problems throughout the CD. There really isn't a single bad beat on here - everything is funky, soulful, and dope. The crew stays on point throughout, jumping from humor to seriousness with ease. They also keep things interesting even though they rap about relationships throughout. The one-sidedness of the music ends up costing them a little though as this is one of those albums you have to be in the mood to play. I still will definitely peep their 2008 release and hope they do a regular album so I can hear these guys address different topics."
2,fake,this movie dont make any sense at all one of dumb segal action movie where he never get hurt when he is shot at 115 times. the only good part its the credit where they show that fat comdeian in a talk show but thats only 4 mins this movie aint worth it.
1,Don't buy it.,"I am a fan of Steven Segal, however, his movies are getting tired. The opening scene of a politician ranting against guns in the hands of children highlights Segal's liberal bent. This is followed by a silly ""rescue"" of this politician from a group of ""gun nuts"" who are more professional than the Secret Service. Of course, Segal kills them all and even downs a helicopter with a small 9mm that suddenly converts to full auto. The movie goes down hill from there with all the usual fodder from Hollywood; crooked cops, honest drug dealers and corrupt officials. Even his martial arts skills have gone down hill. Not worth the rental cost, much less a purchase."
3,Worth the rental money,"After last couple of Seagal flops like Fire Down Below and The Patriot this movie is quite a relief. Very entertaining with some good humor and a lot of bullets and explosions. The story is not something you will follow, its really all about the action. Will be all very familiar to those who saw Romeo Must Die, but not quite as good though.Steven Seagal plays the same character he played in all his other movies and will most likely play in the ones to come as well. This is a typical cop story where a hero cop gets demoted and the bad guy is never who you think it is. There is really not much else to say. Good fight scenes, colorful environment, matrix like stunts (wirework), and quite a few car chases.Good old dumb fun."
1,Has Steven lost his touch,"This film started off with great promise but then suffered a stream of badly filmed 'one-man-hero-saves-all' cliches. Can you really take seriously the thankless police commander who demoted our man when he saved the day on the bridge at the start of the movie, or the woman boss who would not have looked out of place in a shampoo advertisement or modelling clothes?? The fight action scenes were reasonable. As a biker, I loved the Ducati but why the wheelie? It slows you down when you have three vehicles of bad guys and auto weapons chasing after you while you only have a never ending supply of bullets in your one and only handgun. I know we should not take this seriously and I am very fond of films where you can just watch and not believe all that you see, but this was a poor attempt at revitalising Stevens career and would fit better in the 'film spoof' category. Come on Joel... give us another Matrix."
2,Seen Better Days to my Regret,This film starts out so well that I thought it was going to be one of Steven Seagal's better outings. Unfortunately as the film unfolds it loses focus on the Seagal character in a plot that wanders all over the place and is totally ridiculous even for this genre. Numerous press reports had stated that Seagal was way out of shape and he had to lose quite a bit of weight to get back in shape for this role. Unfortunately he still looked out of shape and actually sympathetic for it. This film is a big disappointment.
2,Exit Wounds dissapoints in many ways.,"This movie was terriable. There is a terriable story surrounded by terriable acting. Steven Segal is, once again, a loan renegade cop with a bad attitude. DMX, in his second movie still seems very unconvincing in his sceens where he is to display any emotion - or lack there of. This movie is filled with mindless plot twist, and pointless fights that end with a sputter rahter than a bang. The most notable happens right before..yet another plot twist. There is killings of characters that in a good movie would effect the characters in some way, however seem to be forgotten about in this movie. If you are going to get Exit Wounds, i suggest you Exit before you are stuck with this mediocare movie."
2,Not the same,"I bought this one because I was fooled by the ""classic"" written on the bottle and the ""made in Germany"". If you are used to the wonderful smell of Badedas, you'll find this formula much messed with! The maker is now ""Unilever"". I have a bottle I bought in the UK (also made in the UK) which smells like the true ""classic"" one, but it doesn't advertise it on the bottle. I compared the two formulas and they are different. This one smells different, as if it were made with cheaper ingredients. That characteristic strong pine-horse chestnut smell is gone. Even the colour has been messed with. It dilutes into a cheap, artificial, almost urinous yellowish-green that makes you want to run away from the bathtub."
5,GREAT for pain!,"This is almost ""magical"" in joint and pain relief. It kind of turns you into mush! When I can't sleep? THIS is what I use...the fragrance is liked by some and not liked by some. It's ""personal"". It IS a different smell. FANTASTIC bubbles!!"
5,"pleasant and bubbly, great for relaxation.","It's very bubbly and the bubbles stay for a long time. Very pleasantly fragrant and relaxing, I wouldn't describe it as woodsy, but it does have a natural and clean type of smell. My boyfriend doesn't like scents and cologne, but he's totally fine with it. It does turn the water into a bright yellow/green color."
3,Disappointing,"I don't care if Guided By Voices want to abandon lo-fi and make a professional-sounding recording, but Ric Ocasek wasn't the guy to help them do it. This CD sounds like the Cars. That would be bad enough except that it also sounds like Weezer, which is downright irritating. If you're new to GBV, try ""Bee Thousand"" or ""Under The Bushes Under The Stars"" instead."
4,"A wonderful Album, but not the best GBV out there","Do the Collapse is a wonderful album, but it is not quite the same as the past Guided by Voices work. I find both the lyrics anthe music to be less complicated and thought provoking than all the previous albums. But this is not necissarily a bad thing. I can listen to this music while working and still get something out of it- unlike past albums that require one's full attention (and often written out lyrics) Overall, I think this is a wonderful album but not GBV's best work."
3,go to itunes,"i'll tell you what. i can't speak for this movie; haven't seen it and won't, but on itunes they have the music soundtrack and you have to hear/download/buy jon burrows (as 'Elvis Presley') sing michael jackson's 'Wanna be startin' something' and the Police's 'Every breath you take'. 'Elvis' singing Michael's 'Wanna be startin' something' had me laughing for hours. they're both sung as if Elvis were alive today and it's a hoot !!!!!!Eric Alver"
1,Joel Gilbert shouldn't have quit his day job!,"This is a complete waste of money!! Joel Gilbert is delusional if he thinks people are gullible enough to believe his fake ""documentary"". Before you even watch the DVD, you only have to listen to ""Jon Burrows a.k.a. Elvis'"" audio cd to know it's got B.S. written all over it!!! Mr. Gilbert, you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to mislead true Elvis fans into believing your fairytale story. Classifying your fantasy of hunting down Elvis a ""documentary"" is an outright lie."
3,Native American Cultures are not the Same!,"Bonvillain, Nancy. The Cheyennes: People of the Plains. Native Americans The Millbrook Press, Brookfield, CT, 1996. ISBN 0-7613-0015-5. 64p. Juvenile Literature. (age 8 and up)This informational book on the Cheyennes is a good resource for any student. Included are a recipe, a glossary, a bibliography, photos, and drawings of the Cheyenne culture. The information rages from life on the reservation a long time ago to Cheyennes today. This book is one in a series of different books about Native American people and their culture. Bonvillain does a brilliant job of communicating that each Native American culture has its own personality. The stereotypical term ""Indian"" is long gone with Bonvillain's brilliant research.Cindy Hopp 07/02/00"
5,Takeshi's most bittersweet cinematic poetry,"I've seen many, perhaps most, of Kitano's films and enjoyed this one the most. The film works rhythmically and musically better than Firworks (hanabi) and Boiling Point (3-4 x 10gatsu), and addresses the same themes (the isolation, futility and entrapments of yakuza life and violence, the beauty of the ocean, loyalty, revenge, desperation, etc.) much more succinctly and poignantly. Particularly the second half of the film, that takes place by the ocean, is full of bittersweet humor and a beautiful simplicity, which are a nice contrast to the violence of the yakuza underworld. This film also manages to escape the nauseating sentimentality of Kikujiro, yet remain true to its poetic heart."
1,make sure you know what you're getting into,"I got almost nothing out of this movie. I'd like to believe the guy who suggests that it's because I don't speak Japanese, but I don't think that's the problem. I've enjoyed lots of foreign films, including Zatoichi by the same director. This movie, however, I did not enjoy. All of the comparisons to The Godfather and Goodfellas are totally unwarranted, and I must say I wonder if the people making them are truly genuine, or just plants of some kind. There are parts of Sonatine that I enjoyed, but on the whole I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I will say that some of the acting is good, but as a whole the movie does not succeed."
3,Good Carafe,"I bought this red carafe as an extra to go with my Red Hamilton Beach Automatic Drip Coffee Maker (43253H). Apparently Hamilton Beach is no longer making replacement carafes for their model and I heard a rumor from a reviewer elsewhere that this one would suit. I wanted an extra on hand just in case the one that came with it breaks so I took a chance and bought this one. It fits the Hamilton Beach machine well. It's pretty no nonsense: it's a carafe, it holds coffee, it does the job. This urn won't win any design awards but it's comparable in quality to the one that came with the HB machine. The lid snaps on though which makes it easier to deal with in my opinion. I'm a little salty about the cost of the carafe but it will do fine."
2,It could have been so much better but unfortunately.......,"I really thought this movie might be something from watching the trailers but it was a great disappointment! The ending especially was awful, no sense at all!"
4,Better then you think.,"This Movie is a bit better then you think. A bit bloody. But fun and the ending is a real kick...i got it a Target. glad I did. With everyone saying how bad it was. it is better then you think...If you got the time, watch it..."
4,"For the First Times, the Aliens Actually Won!","I thought this movie was great!!I didn't like Alien movies where they come here and then guys like Will Smith would punch the alien in the head and knock him out in ""Independence Day""!! This kind of childish humor makes the movie lose all its power. Or other movies where humans are able to defend themselves from aliens, but birds save humans by defeating the aliens themselves in ""War Of The Worlds"". If aliens were checking on and studying humans all these years and decided to come and occupy their planet, they would be well prepared.This movie was good because the aliens actually kicked our butts. Humans were no match to them, and they actually lost the war fair and square. The only thing I didn't like was that we never got to see the actual aliens. We saw their vehicles but not the aliens themselves.Good movie! One of my favorites."
1,Save your money,"I hate movies that don't actually end. This movie was made just to show off unique FX. The plot was shallow, the acting mediocre the ending non-existant. I watched this on Netflix, what a waste of two hours of my life."
1,Not very thought through,"The movie trailers made this movie look very interesting to me but after reviews I watched it not expecting very much. Just to keep this simple, the acting was poor, the story line I feel was not thought through. They would say one thing like it was important but left you hanging wondering why they said it in the first place. The ending was one of those that leaves you hanging yet disapointed. I do see how some may like the way this movie ended but it was not for me."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Skyline was the worst reviewed movie of 2010 and not without cause. Basically it's a different version of War of The Worlds, with less of a storyline, and a ridiculous ending. The sad part of this whole thing is that the movie started out really good. After the event, I was on the edge of my seat, and then it all goes downhill from there. Eric Balfour is such a good actor, but he's constantly being cast in these subpar movies. I don't understand why nobody wants to offer him a role in a major motion picture. Once again he's very good and engaging in a movie that just crashes and burns. The special effects were cool, the acting wasn't bad, but the story stinks and the further into it you get, the more you keep asking yourself, why am I still watching this?"
1,Horrible,Stupid storyline. Poor acting. Just flat out disappointing and horrible. I really hate looking forward to a good alien invasion movie and then end up disgusted.
1,Skyline the worst,"This has to be the WORST movie I have ever seen in many many years, it's not even worth to be free."
4,Difference of opinion,"Ok the movie starts off with action I'm into the movie than goes back to the begining before all hell breaks loose. Once the movie gets to the opening scene your on the edge of your seat no time to worry why they came, if your not blind you can clearly see they are abducting humans and later on if your smart you see they are all probably organic metal(whatever) so they use our brains to function. This movie is intense and I think I can speak For other Sci-fi fans who liked the movie, would like to see another movie(part 2) or something cause the end was just the begining. what if their were more people like the guy at the end or just him alone or the aliens go to more planets. a little mini series thats all I'm saying."
2,it wasn't THAT bad,"There are some aspects of this movie that I like: the acting is OK, the special effects are generally pretty good (even though certain parts are a little unrealistic), and I was always wondering what was going to happen.To me, the problem with this movie is that some important movie elements---character development, storyline logic, realism, and the ending---are all lacking. I don't think any particular one of those elements are especially terrible, it's just that none of them really work all that well here and all these sub par elements combined make this a sub par movie that had lots of unfulfilled potential.Nevertheless, it kept me entertained, and I honestly don't think it's as bad as everyone else seems to think it is. If you decide to watch it, my advice is don't set your expectations too high and don't take it too seriously, and you might enjoy it despite its flaws.2 and a half stars"
2,"Horrible, horrible ending","At least two third of this movie is fun, teasing us with the prospects of an alien invasion and allowing us to imagine what is happening once a person is sucked by the light into an alien ship.But, lord in heaven, what were they thinking with the ending? Did they not do any audience testing? At the least, they could have left the conclusion open ended. Instead, we got the height of silliness."
2,Hilarious Unintentional Parody,"I rarely watch SciFi movies because in general they can be counted on to be trite, unimaginative, and deathly dull. This movie is no exception save for the special effects, which are really good CGI. But the plot is, well, entirely vacant and the acting is wooden and the script was apparently written by an eight-year-old who clearly enjoyed highly caffeinated soda more than literature of any kind. Pretty much no cliche is left unturned, but the funniest moment for me was when the terrifying alien invader - that has resisted all manner of hi-tech weaponry so far - is vanquished by one angry young dude's fists of fury. This is very much a case of ""use the farce, Luke, use the farce"" and if you're a fan of time-wasting empty trash then this is absolutely the movie for you."
2,Confused,"I found myself wondering if this film were based on a video game. Lame acting--main character seems to be on drugs. More action than character development. Unrealistic reactions from some characters. For this type of movie, didn't like the flashback style of the beginning. No need to see the first few minutes again.However, most of the movie was better than I expected. This movie received terrible reviews and was only in theaters where I live for a very short time. Didn't expect much, so wasn't disappointed.Except with the ending. Very abrupt and left me going HUH?? Pretty obvious what would eventually happen, but interesting that the creators avoided explicit violence at the very end, unlike throughout the earlier film. I think they were hoping the film would be a hit so they could justify a sequel that would pick up at this point. Probably not, unless it goes straight to video."
1,I really wanted to see this movie.......then I did! TERRIBLE!,"I can't possibly say anything more then the other 100+ people who gave this a terrible review. Other then the solid cast of Eric Balfour, David Zayas and that guy from Scrubs it had very little to offer. OK so it had pretty good effects well that's great, but they sure don't make up for PLOT HOLES and a bad script. The ending, how depressing was that?! Watch Battle for L.A. which was a much better film.Recommend this DVD to someone you really wanna piss off! LOL"
1,Not supposed to be funny... but it is!,"This movie is TERRIBLE! If you're the kind of person who likes to watch bad movies and make fun of them - this one's for you. The ""acting"" WILL make you laugh at times. The problem is - it's not supposed to be funny. Stay away from this movie if you value your time at all (94 minutes I'll never get back)."
2,"No plot, no intelligent ending, terrible sci fi with good effects","I have been watching and reading sci fi for about 55 years. I have seen all the good movies starting from The Day the Earth Stood Still to Five Million Years to Earth, and I have to say this was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. There was no real plot. The invaders come, they take over the earth, the main characters get taken aboard the ship and five minutes later the movie is over. No explanation, no understanding and you are left hanging with the thought "" Why did they cut off the movie in the middle?"" Maybe they want to sell a sequel? I think that is the only possibility. The only things that were good were the special effects. But what good is a movie if there is no plot resolution and it stops abruptly? These directors have to go back to school and learn how to finish something they started. Save your money."
4,Too slow to start,Starts slow. Not as good as anticipated. Could have had more substance to the story. It looks like a lead in to a possible follow up movie.
1,Worse movie ever! to the Nth degree,"-273 Abosolute Zero rating is too high for this movie. A wannabe ""War of the Worlds' movie that fails miserably with storyline and execution. Even the special effects aren't so special. The $0.99 cents I paid to watch this movie was a waste of money and for sure a major waste of time!!"
2,but seriously ...,"Yes - Wesley Willis has something to say. No - this is not music. For those of you ultra-bohemian (or perhaps simply misinformed) listeners who liken Wesley Willis to the next Sex Pistols, you are gravely mistaken. Punk rock, and indeed all good music, has been about inspiring an audience through lyrics and music. While Willis provides a certain jarring form of entertainment (which could explain the identification with punk), I refuse to believe that anyone could actually be inspired by a single one of his songs. Listening to his droning Casio inspires a sickness a la Clockwork Orange, while his lyrics do little but recount the nominal details of his admittedly odd existence. If, somehow, his music truly moves you, or his lyrics about mullets or birdman change your outlook on life, by all means buy this album - then quickly check yourself into to some sort of institution."
4,Good for the fan of the movie,"If you're a fan of the movie Weird Science and you enjoy the quintessential '80s music that formed its soundtrack, then this album is for you. The songs on the record are a pleasant reminder of the scenes they were featured in, usually as background music, and they also stand well on their own as a compilation of nice tunes. If that's what you like, go ahead and buy this record. It's just too bad that it is out of production, as this seems to be one of the only ways to buy it.I do have one small complaint about the description on the product page: In the song listing, it says that there is one at the end of the album called ""Weird Romance,"" which, as it turns out, is not on the album. I hope someone can correct this."
2,"Great editor, lousy to use for anything else","While VED is a great editor, trying to save the files in anything but VED's proprietary format has been nothing but a pain. Nova technical support has been no help either. I've spent over $200 and several days' work getting advanced technical support and buying new RAM, all of which were supposed to clear up the errors I was getting. No luck yet.I met a former Project Manager from Nova who told me VED was probably the least favorite product they've ever produced. I can see why. I'm moving on to an Adobe product from now on."
3,Body butter,"The body butter flavor tasted a little funny. It wasn't what I thought it would taste like, but it works because I used to avoid another kind of taste..so I was satisfied and so was she."
2,Lid cracked,"The bowls arrived as promised and look good have a good weight to them and the lids seal nicely ...but I just used the 5"" bowl and lid washed them and the lid is cracked in two places ...first time using it and cracked already doesnt bode well for the lids as I use them more often"
3,Pink Bowls - How to keep the boys from using your bowls!,"Love it they stack easily, taking up minimal space and best of all the guys in my house prefer to use other bowls!!"
2,"Cute idea, but ...","While I have covered this item in my blog, it has had mostly performance and battery problems; sent back 3 times for repair. Great idea with depth and fish size monitor, but when it ""worked"", it gave false positives and missed many fish; can't say depth finder was accurate. Most of the time the monitor was blank -- no fish, no depth."
1,Very disappointed,"I don't like writing negative reviews, but I'd like to save someone else the hassle I had and money lost.The lamp arrived with a broken bulb. I replaced the bulb and plugged the lamp in for several hours. The colored ""goo"" never separated - just sat in a lump at the bottom of the glass. The glass got quite hot, so I feel the lamp was very old. I spent nearly $10 to return it and was reimbursed the original cost of the lamp with the shipping, but it still cost me $10 for nothing."
5,Great resource for the new upholsterer!,"This book was clear and concise in it's instructions for upholstering most anything. Good illustrattions and easy, step-by-step guide. It gave me the confidence to tackle a loveseat for my very first project. It turned out great. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn how to upholster furniture."
1,"Dated sound, maybe next record will be better...","Just the fact that they got Teri Nunn on one song and do a cover of Gary Numan's ""Cars"" gives you an idea where these guys hearts are at. Older guys trying to speak to my generation! Plus I hear they just replaced their millionth member! If you like this style music your better off with Rage, Marilyn or even FatBoySlim for that matter. Where's the heart?"
5,Great Record!,I think the record rocks from top to bottom.All my freinds own there own copy.I hear they're amazing live and i can't wait to see for myself.
5,Nourishing The Caregiver,Fred Hersch's music is so beautifully arranged and calming that it has quickly become our favorite CD. In a dental practice it really helps to restore balance to an anxious patient or a team member under stress. Music in a dental office is always tricky. This is one of our best means of creating a healthier environment.
5,Devil of Nanking,I found this book very intriguing and most enjoyable. It is well written and a Wonderful story of very tragic times
1,Terrible Waste of Time,"A terrible book. I gave up and abandoned it after 150 pages of its 400+ pages.Most disappointed because I have read many good things about Mo Hayder and she was recommended by friends. But I just couldn't get into this book at all. A very boring read. The font size was also very small and difficult to read. That's why I love my Kindle -- you can increase the font size. If I'd got the KIndle version perhaps my opinion would be different, but I doubt it. Skip this one.I will give her another try, but maybe one of the Jack Caffery series for which she is most famous. Hope it is better."
4,good book,"The drawings in this book are amazing. I think the book would be better with photographs of the finished shoe next to each drawing. Also, the about Manolo section is too small, it could have given a longer biography."
4,Objects of Desire,"I bought this title as a small treat for myself, and it didn't disappoint. It's a gorgeous little package, and the perfect small gift for a girlfriend who likes shoes. The pictures really are works of art, and the descriptions of the materials used in each shoe in the index are amazing!"
5,Excellent,"The book was a little more worn that I expected, but still in good condition, especially for the price I paid for it. Very quick shipping, thanks a bunch!"
4,"Great overview, quick read",Easy reading on the plane to immediately get smart on how the American government and the different branches work.
5,GREAT REFERENCE. WELL ORGANIZED,"I doubt if this is the only book that you will ever need on this subject, but it is certainly one that you should not be without. I frequently use it as a quick reference/refresher before ""going on a shoot."" The topics are organized into 2-4 pages each that provide a lot of explanation without getting bogged down in chemistry and physics. Lots of great photos to illustrate the major points."
3,This is NOT a Silvio Rodriguez recording,"For those of you who are disappointed for this recording, and say that Silvio did not made a good job on this one, you should know that this record, even tought that has Silvio's name on it, is a recording from a Cuban gropu named ""Sintesis"", in this recording they borrow some Silvio's songs and made all the musical arrengements. Silvio's participation (Singing) is only on ""El hombre extraño"", which, by te way, was recorded live by Silvio on his Chile concert (1990). So, don't feel disappointed with Silvio on this one, because i didn't really recorded it."
4,Great remote.,"Love this remote. Finally a remote that can control everything! I had mixed success with previous universal remotes. The primary problem was finding one that controlled my DishNetwork DVR without breaking the bank. The only real draw back to this remote is lack of some sort of tactile response for the keys on the screen. With larger fingers, sometimes it is difficult to hit the words correctly, but that is not too big a deal. Follow the instructions and use the thing for a while before launching into programming it and you'll do fine. It is a bit of a hassle to program (can't edit macros), but heck, once you have it right, your done! It does take a little patience to figure out how to get everything in there and working, but it just takes a little time. I basically did one macro at a time, used it for a while, figured out what tweaks would make it perfect and then re-did it. A truly universal remote for a great price!"
3,Misleading Capabilities,"My Dish HDTV receiver operates with an RF remote. I bought the URC300 remote because it claims RF ability. This is misleading. It sends RF to an optional expander ($50.00) which then sends IR signals to your components. If you have an RF component like I do, this remote will not control it.It also claims 15 component capability. It will control 15 DIFFERENT components, but if you have a DVD recorder and a DVD player; you have to choose which one to program, this remote will not operate two different DVD models.Long story = short. I still needed two remotes besides this one to operate my system.I returned the URC300 for a Harmony model. I'll still need a remote just to turn on the Dish HDTV receiver, but the Harmony will run every other component flawslessly. Which is more than I could say about URC300."
4,Solid Remote,"This remote is a solid performer. However, there are some cons that would make this remote a hands-down 5 star winner.1) No PC interface. It would be nice to setup / edit remote settings via a PC interface which would also allow real-time access to the latest device codes.2) No ability to edit macros. Macros can be very powerful and can contain up to 190 lines (commands). However, there is no way to edit your existing macro. The options are erase and rerecord (start over). A PC interface could fix this issue.3) No way to turn off the remote. It continues to display data on the screen 7 x 24. Would be a nice battery saving feature.4) No way to set a device as a default. As a result, you must select the device (TV or Cable) every time to operate your preferred device (e.g. TV).5) Documentation could provide more details and examples. The website does not provide any additional help and the FAQ page on the site is still under construction. No user forum available either."
5,Superb account of the war in North Africa,"One of the better WWII books I have read (there have been hundreds over the last fifty odd years). Splendid research, packed with all sorts of interesting facts and footnotes. Plenty of small stories within the larger frame of the epic battles against Rommel and his much-vaunted 'Afrikans'.The writers captured the 'live and let live' feeling the combatants had in the harsh desert regions, many times risking their own lives to save wounded enemies. Lots of info about the armored aspects of the battles as well as the troops on each side with plenty of detail about the Italian troops, armor etc and lots of unique stories about actions where VCs were awarded.Highly recommend this book for anyone tired of the usual run of the mill WWII histories as this sheds light on the more human side of war.You won't regret reading this and the last few pages are terrific."
4,Great Textbook,"This is a great textbook for those who do not really understand statistics, but want to learn. It is easy to read and follow along with."
3,"Very clearly written for beginner, but incorrect end-of-chapter answers","I bought a printed version of this book from Amazon for a statistics course that I'm taking. The book provides clear explanations of concepts, and plenty of example formulas. It gets an A for writing style and concept coverage.But the end-of-chapter odd numbered answers provided in the back of the book are incorrect. It's not just one or two answers, it is the majority of them. Our instructor provided us with the even numbered answers (likely provided in the instructor resources) and those answers are incorrect as well. See Chapters 5 & 6 if you want to check for yourself. For a book that costs over $136 on Amazon, and $177 from the publisher (Pearson), it could at least be accurate so students can verify their answers.Pearson and the author need to publish errata on the Pearson website and provide the correct solutions to the end-of chapter problems."
3,World Aflame,The book was an older copy but aside from being a little discolored it was great. I am 2/3 through reading it and it is a good read. I would recomend it to anyone who is triing to improve their Christian walk.
3,Sarah Brightman In Concert,"Wonderful, talented, beautiful, loving Sarah Brightman deserves better than this video has to offer. While the music and Sarah are overwhelming in beauty, the POOR QUALITY OF THE VIDEO REPRODUCTION is unforgivable. All through the concert the static sounds diminish greatly the enjoyment of music. The static distracts and ruins the moment. During all events of applause the skips in sound are horrible. It sounds as if the microphone was being turned off and on all during applause. It prevents one from even enjoying the applause given to the artists. In the last song with Andrea Bocelli the skips in sound and static was at its worst. I regret paying the price for this video. I respect Sarah far too much to allow this junky video on the market. Edsol Crowder"
3,"Sarah is lovely and sweet, but why the lip-synching?","Sarah starts off kind of wooden but always smiles disarmingly at the audience; she gets somewhat better as the concert continues but the reality of this concert is marred by her lipsynching ""Tu Quieres Volver"" from her ""Time to Say Goodbye"" album (recorded 11/96-3/97; this concert dated 9/97) and ""Who Wants to Live Forever"" from the same album (she also lip-synchs the same track on her EDEN video!) There are, however, some lovely moments."
1,Too slow and drowsy,"After seeing her performance on PBS in Eden, we ordered this video. Unfortunately this is nothing like that concert and should probably be avoided if you do not want be put asleep. No change in tempo or tone for the performance."
4,"Sarah Brightman in Concert, Royal Albert Hall, 1998","I am a relative newcomer to the Sarah Brightman faithful, my first real eperience with the Angel was ""One Night in Eden"". That concert/video/DVD has set a standard that will be extremely difficult to match.""Sarah Brighman in Concert"" preceeded ""Eden"" by at least a year, however I have just recently purchased the video. ""In Concert"" is not ""Eden"", it gets off to a rather slow start, but it has a dynamite finish.I am now scouring the net attemptiing to find any other Sarah Brightman videos."
4,"""See How They Grow; Tree Animals""","Like all of the ""See How They Grow"" books and videos, ""Tree Animals"" is full of colorful photos of live animals in as ""natural"" an habitate as one can acheive in a white background studio. The photography is crisp and most of the writing is accurate. It was a bit andropomorphic, assumably for the purpose of helping young reader's to empathize to the animals. My only complaint would be the use of the word, ""Buzzard"" as the name for the ""Buzzard Hawk"" shown in the book. If one needed to be chosen from it's proper name, I wish they'd have used, ""Hawk"", so as not to confuse young minds who are just learning about catagorizing the bird family. My four year old now insists all hawks in the wild or zoos are, ""buzzards"". Thanks Sony. Otherwise, a lovely addition to any child's reference library. END"
4,Not quite as good as the previous one....,"I was so excited to see a new Goldstone book about book collecting out. I loved ""Used and Rare"" and reread it several times (and I'm not a rereader). While ""Slightly Chipped"" is quite good, and I would recommend it to book lovers, it doesn't quite have the excitement and thrill of discovery conveyed in ""Used and Rare"". There are some long digressions (one about Bloomsbury, one about mystery novels, one about the Southeby's auction of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's stuff) and less on the thrill of hunting down books and the excitement of discovering something new. There are also fewer descriptions of the eccentric book dealers (maybe the Goldstones have become wary of offending their booksellers?). It's a good book, an enjoyable book, but I just don't think it's quite as good or enjoyable as ""Used and Rare""."
5,I THINK IT IS GREAT! What are people expecting?,"This is a great little book about the Goldstone's personal explorations into the book world and the people they meet there. Their descriptions of the people they meet, the Duke and Duchess, book dealers and their shops, fairs, auctions, etc., are exactly in keeping with the tone of the first book and I enjoyed it quite as much. One of the things that impressed me the most was the thoughts, pro, con, and speculative, about the internet and where it may or may not be going and possible ramifications of this. It is important, but nobody can truly answer that question yet. I loved it. I use the internet (obviously). I live in small town USA and love books, but cannot always get my hands on them without long distances and elaborate plans. Bibliofind is worth a lot to me all on its own. Helpful or not, I just enjoyed reading the book. It wouldn't even be the same without the menus. The mood is all part of the book. I can't wait for the next one."
2,A disappointment after their first effort,"While I found their first book about books compelling and even inspirational, this book was sadly lacking in detail and didn't talk about books very much at all. It reeked of a project done to fulfill a contract and justify an advance--there's more filler than real content, by a LONG chalk."
3,monk season 2,this is fine but the the box was in terrible condition and smashed corners. idk about u but i know monk would't find this exceptabe
1,Page Turner?,"This book will keep you turning the first 50 pages in the hope that something might actually happen. It doesn't. This is one of the slowest moving, boring, beginnings I've ever read. Wondering how it ever got published is the only excitement you'll receive."
2,Needs a non rubber handle,Love the brush but hate the rubber handle. My hair sticks to it and it gets wrapped around the handle. Very annoying when I am using it trying to blow dry my hair.
3,Glove oil or conditioner needed.,"I bought this glove on Amazon. It was my 3th glove. I have one from Rawlings, Easton and now Mizuno.The ""Slider"" series from Mizuno is like their other ""Franchise"" serie. The leather is not the best you can have for this price (60$) but still good. Be warned, this glove is not easy to break. You can't play right after you got him. You must be patient and have some glove oil or conditioner. Mizuno is a very good brand, but their low cost glove not match with those of Easton ""Natural Elite Series"" for example.I can not fully recommend this glove.If you want to play right after your purchase, buy the series ""Natural Elite"" (NE) glove from Easton. To me and after a comparaison, it's clear that this Mizuno glove can't match with my Easton glove.The inside of the glove is comfortable. Adult hand size is ok.PS: Mizuno first price glove is like Rawlings first price glove. The leather still similar."
5,"A fun, frothy romp","Looking for a fast and sassy read, full of laughs and good cheer? ""On Picking Fruit"" delivers all this, and more, as the lead character searches for love in NY, only to encounter everyones worst dating nightmares. Whether you are a romantic or the most cynical of readers, ""On Picking Fruit"" will leave you with a smile on your face and hope in your heart."
2,poor quality control?,Hemmed sleeves are already coming apart. Either poor product or poor quality control. Be aware that you might need to return it.
1,Not what was expected at all!,"This Santa Suit was a total dissapointment. First of all, the actual suit we received has nothing to do with the one portrayed in the picture. Even though the description states there's no actual jacket (wich is what looks like when you see the photo) it has a pullover wich is not fit for large men acting as Santa, buth rather for a slim one. If you're Santa-like at all, this pullover will look like a girlish nightie on you! Not a good idea if you want to act/work as Santa for family, friends and others. Also, the fabric is sort of seethrough, to make things even worst...On the other hand, we paid $69.98 for this suit. But if you search for a Rubie's Santa Suit (which is the manufacturer) you'll get it for as low as $32.00 (Economy Flannel Santa Suit Adult Halloween Costume (One-Size (Standard))) wich is the product we received.Avoid this item as you would avoid the plague!"
1,The Ultimate POS,"The worst of both worlds: unscientific and boring.Read Osler's WebOsler's Web: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic, Hope and Help for CFS & Fibromyalgia or Fatigued to Fantastic instead"
4,Excellent Introduction to Islam,"I really learned a lot by reading this book about Islamic and Jewish relations. The book introduced me to positive images of Muslims and how they practice Islam. It was great to see how important their community in Long Island is to the people of the Islamic Center of Long Island and how they have worked with groups of different faiths for intercultural exchanges. I am a teacher, and this year I started to develop a unit on the foundations of Islam. Now I want to incorporate some of this book into my lessons. I especially want to include the chapters on women in the mosque and Friday afternoon services. For somebody who new nothing but the stereotypes when it comes to Islam, this book was a terrific introduction to the facts on this powerful religion and culture."
2,About this book,"I read this book,Its a good book cuz there is a lot if work done to collect the data. In my view this book has alot to with public relations skills. I couldn't tell what was the goal of the aurthur wheather he wanted to look good in the eyes of the community or in the eyes of the creator . I think authur should have talked more about the role of Ideal Mosque which is Masjid e Nabawi. I admit by his efforts Mosque is popular in the non muslims and in the community but I think there should more efferts be done on the muslims so that they can be regular in the Mosque"
4,Islamic-American citizens - misinformation corrected,"Dr. Kahn describes the establishing of the Islamic Center of Long Island (ICLI), a process started during the 1980's and continuing to the present. The main contribution of this book is the addressing of the misinformation and other half-truths (many of them malicious in intent) as to how the Islamic community is seen by its non-Islamic neighbors. Dr. Kahn outlines many aspects of the as-practiced Islamic faith, including the message that this is a peace-loving faith that has a lot of compassion for others. He also addresses many hard questions, including Islamic-Jewish interactions and recent terrorist activities. Most readers should find this book to be very educational. In an increasingly diverse society, the Islamic community should be a welcome component of the religious spectrum."
3,Texas Reader,"This book is typical Ogden Nash. Great light-hearted poetry, but with a message (usually). Especially if you're from New England, you'll enjoy the references to New York City. You should know, however, that this book was later published under the title ""Candy is Dandy."" Don't do what I did, and order both, thinking the content would be different."
5,A most gogeous and interesting skating book!,"I found this book to be absolutely wonderful! The photos are gorgeous, and the text is very interesting and informative. For books on skating, this one's in a class by itself! By the way, this book was never promoted as an expose (as the review prior to this one stated) inasmuch as it was published by the juvenile division of Simon and Schuster and meant for readers ages 8 and up!"
2,A book for a beginning fan,"I felt this book, was just ok. I trully expected more when i bought the book. However, I was shoked to find that it really gave no new information. As an avid skating fan for many years, I felt that it could have been much better, I dont recomend it if you have been watching figure skating for more than a month."
2,If you love Time Out...,"You probably will not like this one. Much banging of piano. Fine sax player, but not Desmond. Take five lacks the immortal drum solo and substitutes piano and sax. Leave this one on the shelf, I wish I had."
4,"Simple, yet mature poetry","As with most high school students, I was required to read and analyze ""To An Athlete Dying Young."" Its simple structure, elementary language and subject matter to which I could relate all made it one of my favorite poems at the time. Now, years later, it remains very interesting and drew me into A Shropshire Lad. I was curious to see the other material Housman published and was thrilled to find that all of his work shared similar attractive qualities. His poetry is accessible to even the most novice poetry readers (like myself) and clearly expresses complicated thoughts with beatiful language. Housman's empasis on the brevity of life, death and war are not happy topics, but they are realistic and it is valuable to consider his concise thoughts. I think this book, which essentially follows the life cycle, is full of fascinating poetry that anyone will enjoy, no matter what level you wish to analyze the material. It is a terrific collection."
5,music is life,"In listening to NPR, I selected this artist's CD. I hadn't heard of Gary Moore before. It was money well spent. His blues guitar is what I was looking for. If an updated guitar sound along with old time blues [like the Muddy Waters era] is what you're looking for, this artist & ALB will do just fine."
4,final patrol,"Couldn't put it down. A very exciting, educational read. It is intereresting to know where these pieces of history are now and where I can visit them."
3,Fluff piece,"Some parts are interesting, but there is no new information here and very little substance."
4,Alber Brooks in a mellow key,"Albert Brooks is one of my favorites. But ""Looking for Comedy..."" is one of his more mellow films; he doesn't go for big laughs this time, even though there's plenty of humor. This is a good one for the serious Albert Brooks fan, but for everyone else, it's worth it to watch at least once."
3,"If you Like Albert Brooks, you'll like this film","There are some baseline criteria for liking this film (note: this also applies to Woody Allen cinema).1) You must like Albert Brooks' nebishness (corollary: you should understand a bit about Jewish fatalism)2) You must understand and appreciate sarcasm at its finest3) You must not be offended by vanity scripts-- yes, alot of this is about Albert Brooks, see item #14) You must not be embarrassed by laughing out loud when your intellect is tickledI would have given this a higher rating, but not everyone can meet the above criteria"
1,Totally Humorless,"What in the hell was this? We sat through it, wondering if even a single joke would appear. It didn't.Written by Albert Brooks. Produced by Albert Brooks. Starring Albert Brooks. I sincerely hope Albert Brooks had a good time, because nobody else did.I will be very generous here, and hope he had a point, and that it was that of the oblivious American traveller. He goes to India, which isn't Muslim, and manages to find an alternate reality version of the place so sanitized and Americanized that he could've easily filmed the entire movie on the studio back lot in Hollywood. But if that's the joke, it misfired horribly. If that's not the joke, then my opinion of Albert Brooks must go way down.I really don't want to jump on a ""I've lived in Asia since 1999"" high horse. I just want to say the movie sucks and don't waste your time, so I can go type more words about a more worthy film. And really, all films are more worthy. This is bad."
2,Will the Funny Bits please stand up?,"Saw this at the Dubai Film Festival. Massive hype surrounding the movie with the director and actors present.I waited for the funny parts but there are none. Problem is that it tryies too hard to make you laugh...and falls flat.Ironically, Brooks is looking for comedy in the muslim world while shooting it in India!! A country where muslims are a minority!!His brand of humor is not for me."
1,Winding Through Life ON PROZAC,"Doyle Lawson and his band of very talented musicians obviously visited the drug store before going to the studio to cut this CD. A more dreary set of gospel numbers I've never heard. This effort does not live up to this group's potential. Notwithstanding Bluegrass Unlimited Magazine's adulation of Mr. Lawson in a recent issue, he really needs to get back to bluegrass gospel basics and choose some more spirited arrangements. I wish I had my money back."
5,fantastic sounds,i have listened to many cds over the years.in 38 years in the music buisness i thought that the sound i heard was easy to the ears and very well put together.my wife and i listened to all 5 songs and loved them.sammie lee marler
1,Worked for less than a single page.,"Literally, printed a half-page, with gaps all over the page, and then stopped printing completely. Had to go get my other ones refilled at Costco before being able to return it. I do not recommend."
1,"Mindless story, ecologically offensive message","I don't know what's worse about this book, the lame story or the message that it sends about global warming. The story describes a mindless, pointless, and ultimately unsuccessful quest by a group of animals to tell a polar bear that the polar ice cap is melting. The message of the story is that concerns over global warming are pretty much the same as chicken little's rantings that the sky is falling."
1,"Fell apart, seller won't replace","I bought these scrimmage vests in 3 colors, black, orange and purple. The orange fell apart at the seems. The shoulder seems were not properly stitched and unraveled after two wearings. I contacted the seller and because I was outside the 30 day return policy, they refused to replace them. It was clearly a manufacturing defect. The purple and black did not fall apart, just the orange. Poor quality and even worse customer service."
4,"Not very efficient, but they rock nonetheless","Yamaha takes natural sound seriously and these speakers deliver the kind of fidelity for which you could expect to pay much more. That's not to say they can fairly compete with any high end system, but if you're not ready to lay out $1000, these speakers are entirely adequate and will get the job done for much less. One caveat: They're rated at 6 ohms impedance and are best complemented by a decent active subwoofer. 6 ohms doesn't seem like a big deal until you put power to them. Expect to drive them harder than speakers with 4 ohms impedance or less, but after that it's all good."
5,Very good!,The seller did what they had said. The content of the book is hard to understand because of the writing style.
5,Great Album From One of the Best,"Naugty By Nature really put together a great album in Poverty's Paradise. This is one album that can be listened to the whole way through. Many of their favorites are found on this album such as Feel Me Flow, Craziest, and Clap Yo Hands. Treach is energetic and engaging as usual and Kay Gee's tracks provide him with some incredible instrumentals to complement Naughty By Nature's anthem type music. Even the skits are good; unlike skits on many artists' music these days, the skits on Poverty's Paradise do not detract from the flow of the album and are actually quite nice. This is a must buy for any Naughty By Nature fan and I think it is by far their most complete work to date."
3,"Good starter home, but.....","Pros:1. translucent colors- clear enough to see through, dark enough to give your pet privacy2. adequate ventilation3. solid bottom keeps bedding in4. enough portals to add multiple accessories5. some parts available as replacementsCons:1. plastic pieces break easily(I'm gentle & they still broke)2. parts available online(if they were tough enough in the first place...) not in stores3. have to disassemble for cleaningBottom line, good for a starter home , but eh."
2,Wheel is annoying,"The wheel does not attach properly so when the hamster is running at night, the wheel scrapes on the side of the cage. We have had to put it in a separate room with the door shut at night and we can still hear the scraping. I would not buy another one."
3,Michael Vartan is the best reason to see this movie...,"Too many characters dilute what could have been a moving exploration of the family dynamic. Julianne Moore spent the entire movie lashing out and being hostile to any family member, neighbor or community member who acknowledged her presence and the film never explained why. Also, I found the relationship between the youngest sister and Moore's husband creepy and bordering on pedophilia. Noah Wyle, Blythe Danner, and Roy Scheider turned in excellent performances, but I was most drawn to the fresh faced and intriguing Michael Vartan."
2,"Great acting, but over-the-top angst","I was very impressed by a the acting in this film, particularly Schieder and Wyle, but frankly it lacked a real plot (other than portraying one of the most dysfunctional families around). It was overly depressing and pointless."
5,"Very well directed, acted, written, and thought out film","I find this an amazing piece of reality, and it's a pleasure to watch. An enveloping story."
3,Disappointing,"I recommend buying ""Foundations of Organic Chemistry"" (same publisher) instead. This book is way to brief to be very helpful. There are lots of things missing. I do not recommend. The best book on mechanisms, however, is ""The Art of Writing Reasonable Reaction Mechanisms""."
3,#10 blades,"These are individually wrapped, nicely stacked in the box shipping was fairly quick. I was not charged s&h for the product so I have no complaints there. Don't be confused by the picture, you are getting a single box of #10 blades 100 count."
3,bought for a camcorder,"This box was purchased for a sony camcorder. It fit well, the foam rubber inserts can be cutout to form fit whatever you use it for. The box came in with a little damage to the exterior of the case, I didn't return as I should have."
1,Don't Buy,"If I could pick no stars I would, the whole side of the case around the hinge is coming OFF. The top is coming off.If you care about your Item spend the extra moneyVERY VERY BAD BUY..."
1,It was awesome until it stopped working,I bought the TV new.Pros:1) Best picture I have ever had.2) Amazing experience watching TV.3) Loved this TV and everyone who came by the house commented on how good the picture was.4) Best 18 months of watching TV everCons1) Used the warranty after the first 6 months when the TV stopped working.2) One year later TV not working again ( won't turn on) Samsung 1-800 technician tells me it is out of warranty protection.3) Most expensive TV I have ever owned.4) 18 months later need a new tv.....can I borrow some money!
4,Finally,"I ordered this tv on Dec 29. It arrived with a cracked screen on Jan 8. I wasn't upset about the time it took, but the fact that it looked like someone dropped something directly on the tv. I immediately called Amazon, and an order to have a replacement was created that instant. It is now Jan 15 and I am happy to say the tv looks great. I don't have any HD compnents connected to it yet, but the upgrade from what i had previously is huge. I do hear the buzz that every post seems to include. But i like my sound pretty loud, so we'll see if it gets annoying enough. Great looking tv. A friend of mine is looking to buy the same exact model."
3,Balto III - Wings of Change,"It was all right, unfortunately for fans of the original Balto, voice actors have been changed, so it doesn't deliver the nostalgia needed. Still a decent movie, good morals and such. Original Balto was by far the best of the three though."
1,Not very good,"Bought this thing back on September 15, 2010 and it has already fried. The front 4 ports went out on me about 2 weeks ago and the last ones just crapped out today(11/23/2010). Not good since I use this device to run all my external hardware for work. Would not suggest this product. Not worth the price. If you open it up and look at it it is a circuit board that is supposed to be held by brackets on the metal casing. The board itself is not big enough to fit into the brackets so the card fell into the casing and shorted out the components. The concept is good but I think they need to spend more time on quality control. Not worth the money."
3,Works okay but tastes REALLY bad,"I tried the more milk plus alcohol free initially and was warned that it tasted bad. It was bad, but I could swallow it without gagging. I did not try to put it in OJ or apple juice and just got used to the taste eventually. Then I ran out and wanted to try the special blend with the goats rue. I did not get alcohol free (which I hear generally tastes better). I've tried it twice now and I definitely need to put this in something to hide the taste. It tastes as bad as the poly-vi-sol w/ iron drops, which up until this special blend, was the only med that had ever induced my gag reflex. On the upside, the more milk plus does work. I don't think it was drastic for me, but I did feel like it helped. I assume this will work just as well, but we'll see. I would recommend looking for the alcohol free version for taste purposes."
2,"Not recommended for those with stomach troubles, but easy to return","I tried this product for 3 days, and the stomach troubles became too much. I contacted the company and they are allowing me to return it with no questions, which is the reason for the 2-star rating."
1,Motorola phone dies an early death....,"We've had our phone for about six months. We just wanted a phone with no bells and whistles and were very happy with this one until it just stopped working one day. Keys froze up and nothing we tried, including replacing the battery, fixed it. Our experience sounds comparable to some of the other reviews here. It's inexpensive enough that I don't want to mess with the warranty and judging by others comments, it's doubtful we'd get any satisfaction. We just purchased an ATT model to replace it. I won't be buying any other Motorola phones!"
2,"Like style of phone, but quality stinks","This phone has awful problems with static. I can't figure it out because from time to time I will get static wherever I am in my house and even changing the channel does not help. Another VERY AGGRAVATING problem is that I CAN NOT have my microwave running without horrific static blasting in my ear -- this is absurd. However, I give it a rating of 2 because I really like the caller id, the glowing buttons feature, and the soft buttons.The rings are also a little strange -- only one rings loud enough and the other is too off the wall."
2,A waste of money...,"I purchased this phone in December as a present to myself, and I was dismally disappointed with it. Thinking that the 2.4GHz would have a great reception, I was surprised to find that this phone is little more than a static-noise device. So much so, that I use it for nothing more than a decoration on my desk. Changing the channel does absolutely no good, not even a slight difference can be noticed in reception after doing this. It has some other minor flaws as well, but it's useless to point them out, as what good is this crappy phone if you can't even hear on it?! Best thing about this phone is the appearance of it, nothing more."
1,TERRIBLE!,"I have owned many cordless phones. When I purchased this phone, I figured Motorola was a safe brand to choose. Who knows phones like Motorola right? WRONG! Broke within a week of normal use. BEWARE!"
1,What a let down,"Terrible phone: ringer is very low, no way to control ringer or earpiece volume, terrible reception. Don't waste your money."
3,"Kind of ""old school""",I have to laugh because I have been looking at this DVD for a least 2 years and wanting to view it. I tracked it down in my local library only to find it hadn't been returned and I STILL couldn't watch it....after lots of anticipation waiting to see it I purchased it....it is old school stuff. Basic turns and leaps. Nothing special. The filming is low budget also. The dancers are okay- he is a jumping machine...her leotard is from 1980...but who notices that anyway?....I recommend you try to rent it from the library- it is just a reference and not a really good one at that....
5,Loved them like crazy!,"I always loved Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. They're never die from myheart. I loved to see them together in the film. Of course, I've got lotsof such films in my hand now and definitely only from this Amazon.com,my DVD shopping heaven.I loved you too, Amazon.com, for a really great service and keepingthem Alive!."
5,Of course I liked it #2,"If I did not like this old movie, why do you think I ordered it?Getting DUMBER by the day!"
5,Great gloves for the money!,"These gloves are light years better than the MMA Everlast gloves. Real leather, finger padding that extends down far enough to protect the second knuckle. Even with chewed up knuckles from my Everlast experience, these protected them so much that I didn't even break anything open!Note: There was a slight chemical smell to mine (leather or the dye used), but that seemed to go away with a workout, some Febreeze and Odor Eater powder.Durability seems good, although I just had one use.I would probably still recommend using wraps with the gloves, just to get extra support and protection. The gloves were a little tight with my hands in wraps. I would err on 1 size up if you use wraps. A medium was barely big enough for me."
4,Great Sub!!!!!,I have had these subwoofers for a year now and they still hit very strong. They sound great and they last long. I highly suggest getting a set of these baby's.
4,Great collection of past games!,This is a great collection for those who can remember the old 2600 games. Keeping the high scores and including graphics of the patches and original manuals is great as well. Younger players might not get as much from it though. Its a great collection for the price for sure!
4,Pretty good,"Most of the games in this anthology of Activision's golden age are little more than bizarre curiosities, but the sheer fact that there are 55 of them (complete with some unreleased prototypes and ""alternate"" versions of games involving *gasp* human blood) sure does make up for a lot. Some graphic muddiness due to the GBA screen aside, the video and sound emulation is right on. Most of the good 'uns (River Raid, Pitfall) still hold up surprisingly well, though Kaboom is totally unplayable without the paddle controller. And while you may never actually figure out what the hell is going on with Kabobber or the NASA-licensed Space Shuttle, you're bound to enjoy the minutes trying"
2,Unhappy,"I purchased this Medela manual pump after being dissatisfied with the First Years electric pump. It worked great for a while but after only a couple of months it has begun to lose suction. I used to be able to express at least 5 ounces with ease (in about 15 - 20 minutes) and now I am pumping for 30 -45 minutes and barely getting 2 ounces from each side. There seems to be a leak in the suction and I can hear air escaping each time I pump. Now I am shopping around trying to find another pump to use, without a large cost since I have already purchased 2 types and not had any luck."
1,I should've read the reviews,"I bought this pump based on the Medela name, however, this pump is worthless! I end up hand expressing into the cup which is more effective than this pump. When I finally do get a couple of ounces, it leaks from the seal by the bottle. I ended up purchasing the Isis and am very happy with it! I should've just spent the money on the Pump In Style!"
4,If you decide on a hand pump this one is good,"I decided before having my son - first child - that since I was going to be an at home mom and occasionally pump before leaving the house I would go with a hand pump. After my son was born I used an electric pump at the hospital and rented it for a week at home. That one week turned into 3 or 4. I have used my Harmony hand pump and it works, is easy to clean and is definately comfortable but I was spoiled with the electric double pump. Now the manual pumping seems so tedious & my hands cramp. I have a few times had a problem with the pump popping out of place and not creating the suction but it's been easy to fix for the most part."
4,"interesting, but no depth","This book was fascinating, but I wish more thought had been given to the whys of private life, not just the whats."
4,Five-Eight is worth looking for,"I've been a fan of Five-Eight for a couple of years now and if you've never heard of them, I suggest that you look for any of their cd's. I first encountered this album under the title ""The Angriest Man"". The album is fairly short, straight-forward and to the point, however it never feels rushed. The music and lryics are haunting, even violently more so on ""Depressed All The Time"". This album and the band's ""Weirdo"" should be manditory listening for any true music fan."
4,Jorge Luis Borges meets National Lampoon?,"I was expecting your standard, sophisticated detective stories, but this author has one wacky sense of humor! His detective Baseheart shifts, in the wink of an eye, from a Borges-like intellectual conundrum to Monty Python style silliness. I do wish that his stories were longer, and fleshed out his crazy characters and ideas to a greater degree; but overall, I find Arthur Crowley to be a very entertaining writer. NOTE: I have a couple of kids who were great fans of his children's books, but these Baseheart stories are strictly for older readers."
4,Not Just for Kids,"This book in many ways reminded me of Lynne Withey's biography of Abigail Adams. The writing was forthright and easy to understand. However, sometimes the subject matter seemed more appropriate to an older audience and I often wondered why the book was aimed at a youth audience. Certainly, as an adult reading this book, I took great enjoyment from and interest in it. The inclusion of Abigail's letters certainly indicate the complexity of the woman and of the times she lived in, and there were many times where I felt my heart break for this woman who so loved her family, but outlived 2 of her children. Bober's attention to detail added much interest -- how many trunks of tea were tossed overboard during the Boston Tea Party, why Boston's streets were paved with cobblestones, etc.Bottom line: This is not just a youth book. If you love American history, pick it up."
3,okay for its intended use. lightweight but still durable,"Lightweight but still durable. I got this to hold magazines in the bathroom, it's fine, nothing fancy but suitable for its intended use."
2,Boring score - Buy the soundtrack record instead!,"There's nothing original whatsoever about this score. Buy the soundtrack and feast your ears on zooey deschanel's ""Baby, its cold outside"". Its the best holiday music compilation in years."
2,Title doesn't reflect content,"I agree with the first reviewer; there is much information here, but not specifically about these women as individuals. More of a general treatise about females in this era than detailed portraits. Good but disappointingly misleading because of this discrepancy."
3,No accessories.,"I would have given this a 5 star review for quality, price and super cheap 2 day shipping but it came with no accessories. I have to go buy a bulb and a bolt. Wish I could have just put it in right when I got it :(."
4,a little disappointed,"i havent installed the lights yet but i just opened them just to find out they dont have any of the assembly parts so now i have to go buy the screws needed to install them. maybe, they expect you to use your old screws...and i would have but my car came with no turn signal for me to use the old ones. dang it."
1,This is a waste of time,"I find it hilarious that books like this come into print when some fanatical pastor decides that he must ""set his flock straight.""The Davinci Code is FICTION! Said it with me again. FICTION!It may take some of it's background from history but at it's coreit is nothing but literary entertainment.And anyone who feels compelled to change his/her religious beliefsbecause of it or has to get the ""truth"" from a Davinci Basher bookis a f**king moron!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"Starts with the obvious, buying a home for yourself. Progresses to buying single family homes for rental properties to hold. Does a good job with the numbers which is good as he prescribes some no-money-down techniques. Most authors dont bother you with the numbers, usually just tell you to ""Get that property!"" with no money down and dont bother to teach you if the property will make you any cash flow or not. He tells you how to find partners, and one good idea of how to assume loans with due on sale clauses. Progresses through note buying and ends with a chapter on buying multi-family property.Solid beginners book with a good job on making the numbers work."
3,Smaller than I thought,This is not bad but the size is small. If you are looking for something simple to hold lipstick on vanity this is perfect.
4,"It's nice, the company just needs to make a taller one now.","I liked this so much that I did purchase a second one. Yes, I have a lot of lipstick. It would be nice if these could be made a little taller, so they can hold longer lipstick tubes better. My shorter tubes like Revlon, Maybelline, etc fit nicely, but the my WNW matte longer tubes do not sit in the holder good. It is so nice to have my lipstick standing up right so I can view the colors better."
4,Finally can see all my lipstcks,"Organization of lipstcks has always been an issue for me. This tray is perfect. Would recommend, I bought 2"
5,I love this book!,I keep going back to this wonderful book for the stories and the recipes. But I always photocopy the recipes so I won't mess up the book -- it's too beautiful. I have given it several times as a gift and it's always been gratefully received. I'm glad it's in paperback now.
4,Interesting.,"This book is very good, allthough, is pretty perverted at times. If you can go through the first two chapters without being scared off, you are good for the rest of the book.It is a very good story, which made me think a lot about life and tragedy, and understanding of such. A more advanced read."
2,"Sorry to break it to you guys, but the reviews are out.","First of all, I have no opinion. I have never played the first one and was never planning to get the second. I am merely here to lay down the facts. I got an issue of a game magazine and there was a review of this game- they normally get it prereleased. The game, apparently, was a true disappointment. Not only was it exactly like the last one, but it was apparently very repetitive and exactly like the last game. I heard the first one was great, but supposedly the second one is kind of a bummer. Hey, they could be wrong, but considering that three professionals reviewed it, I wouldn't really think so. For people who maybe played the first one, they could give this a look. Sorry, I have no opinion here, but I'm just laying down the facts for all of you to see."
4,"Quick, Quiet, Quality","Would have like it better if it came with fittings for some common hose sizes (i.e. 1"" to 1.5"") I had to buy these at a hardware store myself. Otherwise, it appears to run quietly and unnoticed."
2,Comfortable but breaks!,"I shopped around before buying and found this to be the most comfortable and portable of all the choices. I took it on a 12 hour (each way) airplane flight and was very happy, packing it in my carry on bag when not in use. As I was preparing to deplane my last flight, my husband put his thumb (NOT a sharp nail) through the pillow and beads flew everywhere! The fabric needs to be more sturdy before I would buy again."
3,Slightly above average Elvis vehicle,"While certainly not as good as any of his 50s pictures (or even BLUE HAWAII), DOUBLE TROUBLE is certainly more watchable than TICKLE ME or HARUM SCARUM.The plot is typical: Elvis falls for two women (that's certainly been done before), and gets into some sort of conflict. This time it's trying to save his girlfriend from her Uncle Gerald, who is after her inheritance.OK, the plot isn't much, but Elvis looks good in some of the outfits he wears in this picture. The songs are not much either, especially the horrid rendition of ""Old MacDonald"". The best songs are ""Long Legged Girl"" and ""City By Night"".At least this is a picture in which I didn't cringe. The dialogue isn't quite as corny as some of the other pictures, and it doesn't get too boring either.A marginal ""thumbs up"" from me."
5,We lost fthe first copy so we HAD to buy it again- It's that good.,"the kids just love the letters. As I said before, we lost our 1st copy somewhere in the house. We searched and searched and searched. The boys have already stated that they wished that we had found the book, ""Christmas just isn't the same without it."" Our first book was a hardcover. It was even better, the letters are actually individual peices of paper that came out of evelopes on the page to be read. Hardcover or paperback this book is Great to sit by the fire and read as a family."
4,Touching Story every body can see it,"It is very fantastic hear touching move, but as far as concerened of sound it is only 2.1 sound output."
3,Yuck!,"This movie is disgusting.I can`t belive i lived through it.It was funny,but gross.I want to see Ace Ventura,when nature calls.I`ll compare it to the first 1."
4,Funny,This was a great movie for Jim Carrey's break through film. He is very funny in this movie. There is some well time humor in this movie. I suggest this movie to anyone who likes movies. one of the better comedies of the 1990's.
3,"Fun Movie, so-so DVD","The movie is a comedic classic now. Jim Carrey's exaggerated physical comedy is great, and the story of ""Ace Ventura"" is a perfect fit for those talents. I laugh a lot when I watch this movie. Ok, 'nuf said about the movie itself.The DVD is sparse on features. The traditional ""Special Features"" section actually doesn't have any special features. It's just a few lines of text, blurbing nothing really interesting. There's the also the traditional commentary audio track, and subtitles in English and French. Oh, and the Trailers for both Ace movies. That's pretty much everything on the DVD.I'm the kind of person that doesn't really care about a DVD being loaded with special features, and even I was disappointed by this DVD."
4,JIM CARREY'S BREAKTHROUGH MOVIE,"THIS SLEEPER HIT IS ABOUT A DIMWITTED GUY NAMED ACE VENTURA [JIM CARREY] WHO SPECIALIZES IN FINDING MISSING ANIMALS AND HELPING EXPLOITED ANIMALS. AFTER THE MIAMI DOLPHINS SHARK IS STOLEN, ACE VENTURA IMMEDIATELY GETS ON THE CASE. THIS MOVIE WAS HILLARIOUS AND HAS SOME MEMORABLE MOMENTS. JIM CARREY STEALS THE SHOW IN THIS MOVIE AND IN THIS MOVIE, HE DEFINITELY PROVED THAT HE HAS TALENT. THIS MOVIE WAS COOL AND ALL JIM CARREY FANS SHOULD REALLY LIKE THIS ONE. FOLLOWED BY ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS AND A SHORT-LIVED ANIMATED SERIES."
4,Early signs of comic genius 4 Stars,"It's interesting to look back on this movie that is now 10 years old, but demonstrates Carrey's range and comic talent in almost seedling form. A simple and funny pastiche on the private detective genre finds Carrey as Ace Ventura, a pet detective (as the title suggests) who's big break appears to be coming in the case of the kidnapping of the Miami Dolphins mascot. A better than average script with some excellent gags ensues, with some nice cameos for Sean Young as the tyrannical police chief, and not least Dan Marino playing himself in slapstick fashion. But this is Carrey's vehicle from start to finish, his wacky and bawdy character almost explodes across the film, and ultimately steals the show. Often very silly, but consistently funny, this movie should now begin to attract a second generation of viewers, which it will accomplish well, being neither dated, or too topical for the year of production. Enjoy"
3,"good, but I'd like a director's cut, please!!!","Ace Ventura, for the most part, is a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. I was pleased with the film the first time I saw it. I have, however, seen it on network TV, and have found out that there are many more scenes present in the TV version not shown on the DVD. These scenes not only make the film better, but also more undestandable.If at all possible, could we see a WIDESCREEN EXTENDED CUT, Mr. Shadyac???Thank you very much."
1,Pan & Scan DVD!,"I thought that I'd hate this movie and had very low expectations; however, I warmed up to this movie quickly and it had me laughing uproariously. So I'd give the MOVIE four or five stars. And, I would love to buy it on DVD, but I can't. Why? Because, at least as of right now (3/26/00), the movie is only available in PAN & SCAN format. It was filmed in widescreen, I want it in widescreen when I buy it on DVD. Check the technical specifications as this may have changed (they're re-releasing Caddyshack in widescreen, so it's possible)."
2,A BIG DISAPOINTMENT,"Being from Canada, I remember I waited a long time for this album to be released here. And when I got it I was deeply disapointed. After Holidays in Eden, this is their worst album. I really liked their last two albums, Brave and AoS, but this one really sucked. The lyrics are corny [""how many of people (my fans) can a guy love"" (or something like that,... please ... give me a break!!)] and there is no catching melody. The songs even sound boring when heard live. The only song that caught my ear was the pop-sounding 'accidental man' and that got boring really quickly. Any ways the CD is sitting on my shelf collecting dust. But in any case, I know I'll buy their next CD, out of a sense of duty more than anything else, but I won't be rushing out the door to get it."
2,This Strange Engine,"If it were'nt for the songs Man of a Thousand Faces or 80 Days, This album would be in the clunker.After all the other good albums they made, they should not have put forth the effort in making this disaster. One Fine Day is horrible and Memory of Water is pitiful. Estonia is not that badbut could have better.i really wish they could have made a better album. I've been a fan since 1984 and Have never been this disappointed by the band."
4,A good date for Concord,"This 1989 recording is Bickert's best for Concord since his very first session for the label back in 1983 (that one a real humdinger with Scott Hamilton and Warren Vache added--and not on CD yet, to my knowledge--a real shame). The two-guitar front line of Bickert and Lofsky works very well, each man complimenting the other perfectly. ""Twisted blues"" and Bird's ""Ah-leu-cha"" are particularly fine. Worth getting."
4,First novel is riveting,"Reading someone's first novel can be a chore, but this was a hard to put down book. It reminded me of David Baldacci books- intricately woven plots, lots of Washington insider information and large number of characters. Sometimes it gets a little hard to follow the people, but it's worth the effort."
5,This book is the best in its class.,This book has the quality of a one year course in finance and accounting. Even if you have only a high school diploma you can understand it. Don't let this comment fool you. The authors of this book have made complex concepts seem simple.
5,author never lets me down,"I read the negative reviews on this book and it only shows the obvious that we all have different opinions of what makes good or bad reading. I found this story heart warming, original with good chacter development. I felt that part of the story was necessary for good plot development. I read late into the night and picked up again in am. I highly recommend this book to any reader who likes a story with depth of emotion. When you read romance,its a given a happy ending will result. With this story it mattered. My time was not wasted."
2,Fluff,"I'm not really into hot, steamy romance novels so was disappointed in this. I'm sure there is a huge audience for it, just not me."
2,A bit TOO sweet for me,"I don't usually read romances especially ones with supernatural themes so maybe I am not the best person to review this. Having said that, I did find this quite readable and enjoyable and thought it was good that Freethy took a few risks and stretched the romance genre by exploring family dynamics in an interesting way (ie, not just the Porters adn the Carrigans but also the two protagonist's upbringings). I found the supernatural elements a bit silly but might be more to other people's tastes. I also noticed that she made numerous references to people wearing knitted clothes. Is it really that cold in San Francisco?"
3,The Sweetest Thing,For the most part it was interesting reading and the characters were believable but a little too much fantasy for me. The romance was too explicit for me as well.
4,"Smooth ink flow, cheap refills","I quite like these italic pens:- cheap refills- smooth ink flow- 3 different nib widths- easily see ink remaining- comfy, round grip (unlike the Lamy Safari)I'm using it in conjunction with the book ""The Italic Way to Beautiful Handwriting"" by Fred Eager - a good match.==========Update 2007-08-26I'd like to knock this down to 3 stars. The lines become inconsistent (i.e, rather thin) on certain pages of my Moleskine notebook. In contrast, my Lamy Safari pen is perfectly consistent.So I'd get both - the Sheaffers with its variety of nibs, for calligraphy practice, and the more expensive Lamy Safari (1.1-mm nib) for writing for pleasure."
3,1 of 2 sticks was DOA!,"I was extremely inconvenienced by having to troubleshoot the problems I was having following installation, butsimple memory tests revealed that 1 out of the 2 new sticks of memory was actually dead upon arrival. Being a 20-year, military trained technician who always uses proper ESD / handling protocols, I am certain I did everything possible to protect the memory during removal from its packaging and subsequent installation into the PC. Unfortunately, this was a minor setback over the holiday. Due to being extremely ill the past week, I have not had the opportunity to return the bad memory, nor discuss the matter with seller. I will update once I've done this."
5,Great value to contemporary women,"While many can and do play at this game, Ms. Resnick does it better than most. The male dominated world she has come to move in so well can be counted upon to throw a few brickbats her way, especially when Ms. Resnick chooses to publicly demystify the arcana of finance and investment. This type of information, engagingly told, is of great value to all contemporary women. Thank you."
1,Does not fit a 99 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS,"I don't understand how a dash kit made especially for the 99 eclipse does not fit the eclipse. I tried shoving it in and it was crooked and stuck out. I went over to a local car shop that does radios and they said there is no way that its going in. However, a universal dash kit from Walmart worked 3x better. Piece of junk. Don't buy."
4,Rigorous explanation of why enlightened selfishness is GOOD,"This book does an incredible job of reviewing the failings of most contemporary explanations of morality and why ""one should be moral"". It then builds a solid case of why a ""should"" must be based on an ""if"". For example, *if* one wants to do well in a course, then one *should* study. The book then shows why one *should* be moral *if* one wants to live, provided that morality is a life-furthering morality.The content in this book is excellent. My only complaint is that the writing is very challenging to read."
5,Best Perfume,Product as described. The price is reasonable.The perfume smells so good. Beautiful Bottle it came in.I will be buying again. Thanks Amazon
5,Love it,I have ordered this on-line and in the stores and couldn't believe the difference in the price on amazon. It is my perfume of choice and will order it again. And now with the great price I don't have to save it for special occasions anymore and can afford to wear it everyday.
4,"Double the Paul, double the pleasure!","Fans of Paul Rodgers' work with Bad Company and especially Free will absolutely love the Live cd of this set. Recorded in Germany, this disc contains some classic Free material that really showcase Paul's magnificent voice. The set opens with Little Bit of Love and keeps soaring from there, with Paul giving an inspired rendition of Be My Friend, in my opinion, Free's most underrated song. The middle section has a definite blues vibe with stirring takes of Louisiana Blues, Muddy Water Blues, Rolling Stone and I'm Ready. The first cd, Now, of original material has some really nice songs. Soul of Love, which was a minor hit, starts it off nicely. Other gems include Heart of Fire, Saving Grace, All I Want is You and I Lost It All. Really, if you appreciate the vocal talents of Paul Rodgers, anything he sings sounds pretty damn good. All in all, this is a definite worthy addition to your collection."
3,an interesting book,"I find it unusual but fitting that this book is categorized...as general fiction and also true crime nonfiction. This duality certainly describes my feelings while reading it. The exploration of the century old murders was very interesting, as were the strange experiences and coincidences that surrounded the authors. One thing that nagged at me though is how much they present their final assumptions as pure fact. Without spoiling the suspense, I will just say that things such as the identity of the veiled woman and the leap they make from that are pure conjecture. Yes, their answers fit the puzzle, but other solutions might have also. I found their narrative quite melodramatic at times. To sum up, I suppose I would say their journey and pursuit of facts was interesting, but I think the reader has to keep an open mind regarding what they present as gospel."
3,Not a Spyderco!,"I would suggest save your money and get a real Spyderco. The screw already fell out with in the first few weeks of having it that holds the clip. It is a really sharp knife, but cheaply made."
5,Hilarious tales from the trenches,"This book is not only funny but the characters are real and likable, even with all of their flaws. You really feel for each one as they endure constant abuse and humuliation in order to please their impossible bosses. It's fast paced, very entertaining, and an overall great summer read!And to the reviewer who said there were glaring errors on page 34.....it's obvious to anyone that has read the rest of the book that the mistakes are intentional and one of many quirks that the Rachel character possesses."
5,An excellent in-depth overview of legal precedents,"Christopher Waldrep's Racial Violence On Trial: A Handbook With Cases, Laws, And Documents isn't just another history of civil rights efforts, but a casebook of laws, documents, and events which uses the experiences of Afro-Americans as a case study to examine legal efforts to combat racism. From court decisions and transcripts to personal accounts, this provides an excellent in-depth overview of legal precedents."
3,"Not so much hidden, as missing","I ordered this DVD as I plan to visit Hawaii in November, and wanted to see what I could look foward to. This DVD did not deliver however. It's very cinematic (thanks to the Imax filming) and the music/commentary is good, but don't expect shots of mainland Hawaii or the islands. The DVD is good if you want to know about the botanical and geological aspects of the islands, but not if you are looking for a traveller's guide. The smart money (IMHO) is with the Lonely Planet guide to Hawaii - much more insightful, and more useful. And it lasts considerably longer than 30 minutes!"
3,Not the picture quality I was expecting,"I am a huge fan of IMAX films on DVD because they all seem to produce a picture quality next to High Definition. This was not the caase with this DVD.Out of all the IMAX films I have seen I have never written about poor picture quality and never expected to. However, this is absoultly the worst transfer to DVD that I have seen for any IMAX fi. It is grainy and blurred at times, and comes nowhere close to the quality I am use to with IMAX DVD. This is the ONLY IMAX DVD I have seen that in my opion is not up to standaard with IMAX film-to-DVD transfer. I am not into the techcal aspects of film transfers but all I can say is I was completly surprised to find grain on this one.Also, the technical aspects states that this is available in ""widescreen"" and it is not.Regardles of widescreen or not, ALL IMAX films (besides Hidden Hawaii) have a high deffinition quality to them and are the best looking picture quality on DVD available."
4,Walkman DNF430,"I have already written an interim report on this item, which I was obliged to send---at my own expense---to Sony's Texas repair facility, on the telephone advice of one of Sony's tech support persons. I liked the device's quality of sound very much, but the controls were too small to work easily and, eventually, the device failed to call up one of its own programs. Sony tech support was unable to help, and advised sending it off to Texas---which I did, and am still waiting for its return plus any comments from that facility on why the device wouldn't call up one of its own programs. Once the device comes back and I have a chance to explore its functioning, I'll provide another report."
5,A Good Buy,"I have had this product for a month now and have used it a lot.Still on the same AA battery!I have tried all sorts of CD's with it and all play fine. (CD-R, CD-RW, MP3...)The tuner seems to be just fine.I get the local TV stations, AM, FM stations just fine.The weather channel I think depends on where you live.It doesn't come through for me unless I'm outdoors. Then just barely. I would suggest adding a case for this product. It has a remote that you can clip to your belt buckle that I find very handy. You need to wear cargo pants though to store the CD player while just using the remote. (The remote keeps you from having to pull out the CD player every time you want to adjust the volume, change stations, change input...TV, AM, FM, Weather.) It's a handy device, not just a gimmick!"
3,You need to get familiar with it,"The sound quality is really good, but the controls are tiny and take some getting used to. I'm glad I've had laser eye surgery so I can see them! You need a 3 V power adapter, NOT a 4.5 V, which is what I bought mistakenly because they were recommended together on Amazon. Also, I was freaking out at first when this loud BEEP would indicate every function (play, pause, etc.) I thought ""Why on earth would Sony think music lovers want to hear beeps?!? Don't we get enough of that with microwave ovens, car alarms, and trucks backing up?!?"" So I called Sony support and someone led me through the steps to turn the beep function off. I'm sure I will need to do a little homework with the manual for all the functions, but it is a very cool, lightweight, multi-functional product."
4,Great CD Player,"It is a great CD/MP3/Radio walkman. No doubt it is the best one of similar products. The CD playing is of best quality. It is possible to adjust sound effect by applying preset or user defined equilizers. Have own the player for some months, two disavantages annoy me: no backlight for LCD on the player. The 4 in 1 radio is really great. However the background noise can not be eliminated. It is can not be ignored if a hi-end headphone is used.If you love enjoying CD replay, choose it. If you are a radio maniac, be prepared not be bothered by the background noise which you can do nothing about it."
1,Over-designed failure,"The main negative issue was volume control. These itty-bitty buttons that access the control took 10 or more seconds to activate the control panel items. The volume on radio was not equal to the CD volume so switching playback from CD to radio was a lesson in frustration to a point I thought the product was defective and returned it to Amazon for an exchange. The new one came and it was the same design flaw. I returned it and bought a similar product at Walgreens for one-third the price. The rating is a zero star. Amazon's customer support was so superb, it was almost worth the trouble."
2,not so great,"I bought this player for my elderly dad, however, the buttons on this player are so small that my dad cannot use it without help. The antenna for the radio is not very strong - I was hoping he could listen to am radio but it gets no reception. Very disappointing for the price."
2,Not one of Sony's most user friendly products,"I bought this just to use as a CD player at the gym. Sound is fine but display is only adequate, and controls are very small. I always need to wear my glasses to change any settings. Would not buy again."
2,Flat,"I enjoyed Hannah's style but none of the stories were particularly memorable. My favorite was the Civil War story, ""Knowing He Was Not My Kind Yet I Followed."" Overall, solid just not to my tastes."
4,Good product!,"My pharmacy carried this product for a while, but when it stopped I was delighted to find it on Amazon. It's easy to use, not messy, great for the nails. It usually has a great scent, too, though the last jar I got didn't--that's why I deducted a star. Much better than other nail creams I have tried."
3,hoof intensive protein,The product did not help my nails to be any stronger as I expected that it would.
1,The title misled me to beleive that it has number of stories,I have read Panchatantra stories since my child hood. The title of this book misled me to believe that it contains all the important stories of panchatantra. To my surprise I found that this book contains only three minor stories from Panchatantra. I recommend that the readership age group the books are structured should be listed along with the book to avoid erroneous ordering
2,Gizmo - stuffing coming out!,"I purchased this Gizmo, which is really cute, but it was not sewn very well. At the top of the leg the stuffing was coming out. I had purchased Gizmo as a gift and was rushed for time, so I stiched it up myself instead of using the return process."
3,Good...for the money,"This screen is exactly as advertised, and if your primary motivation is a home theater with a very small budget; this will probably suit you. It is very easy to mount (I installed a couple of screw hooks into the ceiling and hung the screen from them in about 10 minutes). The surface is very bright and contrasty. The negatives are: uneven surface (of course, this might be different from screen to screen but mine has some subtle ""bulges"" across the surface). If your room has much air current at all, the screen will move and the picture will get ""wavy"". The retractor is very finicky, I have to pul the screen all the way down and keep trying until I get the speed just right between not fast enough to go all the way back into the case, or so fast that it bounces off the mounting hooks. I think if you intend to mount this on a wall instead of a ceiling, these two problems would be eliminated or greatly diminished."
4,I Like This Book... My 4yr old is bored by it,"I agree this may indeed be a book for slightly older children. My daughter does not like this book nearly as much as I do. The drawings are wonderful, and I plan to buy more from this series when she is a bit older."
4,Great Story,"I am a homeschooling mother and is therefore always on the look out for educational books. I love this book even though the focus is not so much on Degas' other works, it tells the story of the little dancer beautifully. The book also paints a clear image of who Degas was and why he, in the end, became a sculptor. Books like these open the eyes of children to the world of arts and they end up having such a great appreciation for art works."
5,Still nead to put it to the test,"Great product, easy to install, awesome performance, though I haven't given it much of a challenge yet. I'm looking forward to when we'll have more applications using the full power of a quad-core.I was lucky to get the one with the new stepping, so maybe I'll do some overclocking when the time is right. No point now; 4 core processors at 2.4GHz is more than enough at the moment."
2,Q6600,"Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 Quad-Core Processor, 2.40 GHz, 8M L2 Cache, LGA 775CAN NOT TELL A LOT ABOUT THIS, HEARD ITS GREAT FOR OVERCLOCKING AND VALUE TO PERFORMANCE, AMAZON SHIPPED RIGHT AWAY EVEN THE GO STEPPING. THE ONE I ORDER WAS VERY UNSTABLE AND ONLY SHOWED 2.3 MHZ HAD TO RETURN IT AND DECIDED TO GO WITH THE Q9550. THIS CHIP IS VERY NICE!!"
4,My Thoughts On This Book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I would definately recommend it to anyone who is curious about Derek Jeter. It gave out a lot of new and interesting facts about him that I didn't know. Whenever I read a chapter, I thought that the book was so good that I had to keep on reading it.I am 11 and I do not think it was my age level though. It was a little confusing, but very interesting!"
4,Awesome,"In the beginning when I heard the Elements *radio mix* i thought it was okay because it was a male voice. However the music got better and there was a female voice. personally, i think female voices are more compaitable with trance than males =[ sorry. Anyway, I give it 4 stars because the beginning didn't really attract me. however towards the middle and the ending were AWESOME! *too bad neo cortex is not that popular* If you like Dj MAngoo, Kate Ryan, Orion too, Lasgo, Becca, Foggy, well.. Neo Cortex is perfect for you then =]"
3,Paint Palette,Keeps paint fresh. Small enough not to get in the way too. Many layers of paper to mix on as well.
3,will work well,quick delivery the only thing is I thought it was sectioned for different pain colors. Even though it isn't it will work well
1,Make it with the DVD cut and I'll buy it!,"When my wife found out about this she was really excited then I told her that it will be the edited for time/content versions that were broadcasted and then she picked up the money she threw at my computer monitor. Sorry but a high quality picture doesn't make up for the lost content.It still boggles the mind that companies continue to F' up Blu-Ray sets, this will be a repeat of the attack of the 1 Stars like the Star Wars set got. Congrats on joining the club in Blu-Ray set fails."
1,Rip off,"The dvds sets are great with lots of bonus materians and extended episodes, this bluray release just sucks. i will keep my dvds sets for now"
1,Was going to buy...now I'm not. Broadcast versions...bahhh,"Could this BE any lamer? Broadcast versions of the episodes? I really wanted to buy this, but now I wont. Vafanapoli!!!"
1,NOT EXTENDED EPISODES,"AGAIN, just like everyone one is saying, Where are the extended editions on blu-ray? Will it eventually be released? Any one know?"
1,"Should have all ""Friends"" giving the finger as cover.","Could Warner Brothers BE more lame? I am SO not buying this. I was so happy when my email inbox read ""Friends blu-ray now available"". Then I looked at the product only to realize it is an inferior product passed on to a new format. I laugh so hard with the DVDs, I really don't want to miss a joke. I can live with the relatively bad image quality of the fist few seasons... When WB retracts from selling an incomplete product, I will be more than happy to lay down the cash for a complete one."
1,Not worth it,"I was really looking forward to an HD version of the series, but I am now cancelling my pre-order since the blu-ray is missing a lot of footage already found on the DVD set."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"Oh ... my ... GOD! Linkin Park?!? Andy, dude, you have GOT to be kidding? I can't waste any more time on you. If you think that these guys are good, then you must lost your manhood long ago. Stinkin Park epitimize the bottom of the ""numetal"" barrel, and this song is one of the biggest stinkers of them all."
4,Nice for storing children's DVDs,I use this to store my daughter's DVDs. I was sick of getting them in and out of the cases so I decided to use this. It does the job.
5,Work great,This is light weight and compact. Actually got this to store our DVD's to make room on the shelfs instead of all the DVD cases.
4,It's a durable CD case.,"It's a durable CD case. The construction quality isn't great but it does its job. I use this case in my car. I usually have surfboards, golf clubs thrown around in my car, i needed a case that could take the punishment."
1,Dangerous and Cheap,Mine SNAPPED after a week in the middle of my back workout. Luckily I wasn't hurt. It's not even repairable. the whole tube ripped near the bottom of the handle.
1,cheap crapie suckish gun,This gun is as crap as they get. When you first get it it is realy good but after one week it feel apart on me. It is realy acrurat but it is crap. I hate it. Not worth 10 dollars or 10 cents i dont recormented it. so just dont get it.
3,Good for a kid,"I ordered this gun for my son to shoot, when I received package and unboxed the rifle it looked pretty cool. I assembled the rear stock and the laser light that mounts on the top rear of the gun, there is also a blue flashlight that mounts under the barrel in front of the pistol grip that is detachable. The only flaw is the magazine, I loaded the 50pk of bb's it came with and slide the feeding pin down and tried to load a series of bb's to fire but noticed where the hole (behind the spring near the bottom)) was became stuck in the hole that the bb's come out from. I contacted Airsplat the next day and they emailed later that day, they are going to take care of it and I don't need to send the gun or mag in before I get a replacement. So, as the rifle goes it is good for a kid, but be careful when loading the mag. As for the Customer Support they get 2 thumbs up, I would do business in the future."
2,please save your money,"this gun is an extremly low quality japenese hunk of plastic the laser goes way of target (just like the shot) the cocking device feels like it will fall right off the scope isnt real the accuracy and distance are horrible the stock on mine broke after 2 weeks use the gun didnt even come with the addvertised hanle grip on the front of the gun the olny good thing about the gun is the little plastic led light on the front is pretty bright so i took it of and gave the gun to my freind.Long story short, i whouldent buy this again if some1 was selling it for 50 cents."
1,this gun sucks,all i have to say.. the worst gun man kind has ever made. last week the price was 20 and today the price is 5? whats up with that? the gun has no accuracy? at all. this is BS. i dont recommend it
5,"A ""Must Buy"" For Anyone Trying to Improve Thier Property","This is an excellent book written specifically to helps ordinary folks improve their property's deer hunting potential. Not only does it asssist in improving deer habitat, it is an excellent tool for overall property management, regardless if you own 10 acres or a thousand. A definate book to buy your deer hunting freind or relative who owns a peice of ground."
5,"Ray Brown, Gene Harris and Jeff Hamilton - Live at the LOA","It belongs quite some time to my record collection and I can say it is one of my favored recordings made by the Ray Brown Trio. You can hear and feel the pleasure they have playing together and the quality of this live recording is absolutely fantastic. It has nothing to do with Monty Alexander. This must be a type error made by Amazon. Don't even listen to it when buying it, just let it send to your home and I garantee you, you have a great time! Jannes A. Scholten"
1,Inaccurate and disappointing,"This book is poorly constructed, poorly written, and poorly researched. It does not follow any real logic. The first 1/3 of this book is about old west outlaws, the remainder is about Hollywood actors who ""play"" old west outlaws. I can speak to the inaccuracies of the Frank and Jesse James chapter. It's highly inaccurate with old ""facts' that were disproven decades ago (such as Cole Younger was a cousin of the James brothers). It's also highly judgemental and has hints of anti-southern, anti-confederate attitudes. There is a lot of information on Jesse James, the James-Younger gang, and the later james gang, if you care to read a few books and do some research, apparently ""Doc"" did not. Spend your hard earned money on better books."
2,Not that good. you will feel the absence of the three HEROS,"Lets be honest, Roger failed to resurrect the old PINK FLOYD songs. For example, Just listen to these songs , The Happiest Days Of Our Lives , Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2 ,Mother ,Comfortably numb and all the songs from the DARK SIDE OF THE MOON album, they are completely ruined , feels like a Pink Floyd tribute band is playing. Listen to that funny voice of that guy who is trying to imitates Dave Gilmour voice in MONEY , or to the guitar player who completely destroyed Comfortably numb ........and more .... SO the album is not a PINK FLOYD live show. But the other solo works of Roger were nicely executed such as Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert , Southhampton Dock from (FINAL CUT which is consider it as Roger's Solo album), Amused To Death . So if want to buy this album to listen to the old Pink Floyd songs .... I tell you this ..DON'T BUY IT But if you like to listen to Roger's solo works then, OK BUY THE ALBUM."
5,Waters at his best,"Listening to this CD, I felt I was at a live show. Light some candles, burn the incense, and crank it up! A must have for Floyd fans. Most excellent!"
2,"Oh, Roger ! Roger what have you done ?!","I like this guy a lot , but I don't know why his overproduction reach as far as to play the mimic of his own , throwing chill water over his fan's neck.Good for a light amusing hour,but it wasn't what Waters used to be. Does God want it?"
5,Amazing,"My license plate reads, ""RWATERS"" because of the endless supply of geniune perfection provided by Roger Waters. Brilliant were his 1999 and 2000 tours, as his concerts stand out as some of the best experiences of my life. The sound quality on ""In the Flesh"" is absolutely phenomenal. Every song is inspirational and uplifting. THIS is the way Roger wanted it to be. [On a darker note, it appears that the editors of Rolling Stone have a serious case of genius envy. Maybe if Roger was wearing the latest in fashion (a-la-Backstreet Boys) would RS have given ""In the Flesh"" a halfway decent review.] Magnificent!"
2,"Does Not Include Smaller Tote and Extra Ice Pack, As Described","I order this set and when I got it, I only received one tote and one ice pack. So, I returned it since it explicitly states you get two ice packs, a large tote and a single bottle tote. Once again, I received just the larger tote and one ice pack. If you are fine with just the one tote and ice pack you will probably like this product, but I really wanted the set so I was not pleased. I do hope that they fix the wording on the product to reflect the set is the tote and ice pack alone. I was very disappointed to not receive the product as described - twice no less - even though Amazon was quick to ship the replacement. Again, hopefully they will change the wording - I don't think I'll be trying to order this one a third time!"
4,Good transport bag,"Although this says it is a 4 bottle cooler, we have never fit that many in it. If you have skinny bottles, maybe 4 would fit, but only 3 Nuk bottles will fit in this bag at a time. WIth a thin ice pack this bag is perfect for transporting milk to/from home/daycare/etc. The side pocket is nice for slipping a bib, spin, pacifier, etc into."
5,Very handy for baby and others.,"Bought this to carry baby bottles and now I use it for lunch. Excellent, slim pack."
4,"Great for daycare, but not 4 bottles","We use the Playtex Dropin Nursers and can really only fit 3 large bottles in this bag. Which is fine because that's all I need for my son in daycare. But I don't know about 4 bottles. Works great though, just small, keeps them cool & easy to carry - that's all you need!"
3,Potential Lost,"Audio not clear, story line good but execution poor. Should have been made clear at the beginning that the girl had a sour relationship with the various boys before the movie starts. Viewer has to guess too much in this type of movie in which guessing is a NO-NO. Silverstone and several of the other actors are good, but some scenes, such as Silverstone taking a bath while on duty, seem awkward, not believable, just to fit the busy plot objective.Photography is very good."
4,Too Much Talking to the Other-selves,"A good trilogy with very interesting mix of characters. However, characters talk too much to their (other)-selves, and that gets annoying after 500 pages. And, that (thing) happened to reborn is just plain stupid. Oh well... a good read non-the-less if you could withstand some disappointments in the storyline."
2,Overall quality,"Produces text in very good quality and images are clear, but it does a poor job of mixing colors. Navy blues, sometimes came out as a baby blue. Contacted Lexmark, and they were not very helpful, very poor support. It's being sent back for a refund. If all you want is a printer for text it's good, but the ink costs are quite expensive."
1,Horrible,"I bought this printer in hopes it would print goood digital camera prints from my Vivitar 2.1MP digital. When I went to install the printer, nothing. I called tech support 3 times!!!! Then i found out that it kicked my digital camera off the computer!!! Now my camera won't load onto the computer. I took it back and bought a hp deskjet 3620. I would recommend this printer to anyone. It was an easy installation (just as Lexmark claimed but this printer actually worked!!!) I printed some great shots I took on my camera before my Lexmark came along. I am going to go buy a HP digital camera. Overall, the Lexmark Z605 Printer is a hoax!"
5,One of the best novels of the 20th century,"This heart-rending novel bleeds. It sweats. It screams. It is so vividly written that you truly feel each character's pain in this most dysfuntional of families. Every character, from the deluded patriarch to his betrayed son, is well drawn and distinct. The plot tightens the screws continually until the climax which is amazing in intensity. I read the last 200 pages of this book in one sitting and was wrung out by the end (the first time a book has ever done that to me!)I note above the criticism that this book has characters offering long baroque speeches. This is probably true. It's also probably too long. Regardless, you will never read a book as vivid, terrifying, painful yet life affirming as this one. It should be read by everyone who loves great literature."
3,Excellent for those on the Path,"Not all of these tracks are great but Dar Williams definitely ranks #1. If you're following the Path of the Wise, check out this CD."
2,Log Rolls,Fits well just don't walk in it. The legs roll up if you do. It's great for sitting around the house though.
1,I wish it would work!,This product is really just a game. A teeze all the way. It will never work. All of the answers to the game are on the Adaptec Support site if you can find them.....the game you know....the game.
3,pretty good map,"this seems to be a thourough map,only one problem it does not have a city or town index....they are listed on the map but you have to look a bit to find them which kinda sux if your not sure of the general area"
1,Cheap at 20 times the price,"Come on Bill, just cut to the chase and make the book $1,000 a pop. It'll save us a lot of landfill and help you with the defense fund."
5,"A favorite, from a favorite author.","The Faded Sun Trilogy is about personal freedom, commitment and responsibilities. It's also about hierarchies and bureaucracies. And there's just a hint of Zen."
5,amazing,I'm so glad that amazon made an online-viewing version of this movie because it's only sold on VHS. Will someone please change the movie description though (what the heck)? Not many people seem to know about this movie but it is very touching with a little bit of humor. <3
1,Book,"Not overly impressed with this one I have bought other dummies books without a lot of problems, this book is to general in it nature and really does nothing to help in the preparation of the test as noted I should have asked for a refund"
3,Too broad based for specific state exams,"I was looking for help in preparing for the NJ state exam and bought this book. I've bought ""Dummy"" books on other subjects before (no wisecracks invited) and was usually pleased. Just re-reading my course book was more helpful than this. This subject has too many specifics for each state to get much help from a generic reference book."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining Although Not Purist,"I must agree with the other reviewers that this performance is not purely Gilbert and Sullivan but it was purely fun and entertaining to me!It can stand on its own as a joyous fun time of laughter and entertainment. I watched it again last night and by the time it was over I was laughing and refreshed by the experience. Yes, it does have some flaws but these are easily overlooked in my opinion as an evening of first class entertainment unfolds.Some of the inside jokes went completely over my head, but this again did not present any insurmountable obstacles for me. I thought the dance with the dolls in Act 2 was hilarious.If you are a Gilbert and Sullivan purist then this production may offend you, as it does some of the reviewers; if you are looking for a well produced and performed evening of musical fun then this may well provide it for you!"
3,decent,"This is one of my MANY led flashlights, I have over a dozen.the good, it is bright, brighter than most of the 3AAA tiny, 9led, flashlights.It gives off a good focused white light.the bad, I've had it for months now, and use it mostly in the house. I don't think I've even gotten it wet, but it started giving off a metal smell and even handling it for 10 minutes will leave my hands smelling like metal for hours. I believe it is starting to rust or erode.also, mush like the cheaper built led flashlights, it suffers from weak contacts. meaning: even when fully tightened, it may not make good contact, so it may not light."
4,"Works well, took a little fiddling with the O-rings","Product works well. This is not made by Waterpik but is listed as a compatible replacement filter. The only issue I had was I had to be very careful seating the O-rings and tightening the connectors very firmly by hand. Threads look a little different from the original model. Anyway, once that was addressed, the filter works quite well."
4,Defintely a keep in my library,This is the second of Dr. Weiss' books that I have read. I have been a consultant for over 20 years and this book provided me with some insights I had not thought of before. Have already taken some of the pointers in the book and included them within my practice.
4,O.K.,"When I bought this it took 8 days to get here, and im in the same time zone as the seller.... When I recieved this it looked slightly used and the pin valve was all grinded down. Scratches were everywhere. Other then this, this tank worked perfectly and it lasted about 3 hours of paintball. And it looks cool! :=)"
5,Thermostat Guard,This Thermostat Guard was very easy to install and absolutely does the trick. It's made of a very heavy and high quality plastic.
3,Be careful with Dimensions,"I purchased this and does not fit even though I checked the dimesions. The dimensions are for the outside of the case and do not account for almost 1 inch on each side for the inner guard. Make sure to deduct almost 2"" in your dimensions if you want to fit."
4,Works as it should,"I purchased the thermostat cover for our Honeywell RTH7500D and it fits - just barely. The proportions are off. The thermostat is rectangular and the cover is closer to square - resulting in about 1/8"" clearance on either side of the thermostat and probably an inch on the top and bottom of the thermostat. I would have preferred a shape which more closely resembled the thermostat but oh well, it works.Other reviewers have recommended that you measure, very carefully, the thermostat and the actual opening on the cover to be sure it suits your needs. I recommend that as well.It does what it's supposed to do - keeps wandering, well-meaning fingers from fiddling with the settings. Our system was constantly being turned off which is silly because it's programmed to turn off when not needed and on when the space will be occupied.Amazon's price on this cover was about 1/2 to 1/3 what I'd seen in local big box home centers...a savings even if you have to pay for shipping."
5,Used to cover fire alarm,"I bought this to cover fire alarms in our apartment since my son kept reaching for them. Normal covers for the alarm were upwards of $90+ ! This works perfectly, safely, and efficiently."
4,Jackanory with Papa Nez,"Forget the high concept or reading the accompanying story every time you play it (your not the boss of me Mike Nesmith!)Just enjoy listening an amazingly crafted record.Great songs, great melodies & a nice laid back pace then never breaks into a trot.I always find it works better listening to the album on a winter's night, no distractions; you can really lose yourself in it for an hour."
4,Informative,"Informative and interesting, giving a range of perspectives of many different writers critiquing Beckett's work."
1,Thought it would work for my short haired cat...,"One of our (many cats) has difficult to comb fur; his fur is too short to use a bristle brush, too silky to use a comb or pin brush (slips right through). Thought a curry brush would be the answer because a curry brush for our short haired, no undercoat dog, worked so well. Alas, it does not work at all. The pins are too close which seems to work against picking up the hair. And it's nearly impossible to clean the hair out if you do manage to pick up some hair. And kitty HATED the rubber brush, but that of course is just my psycho cat."
4,Why not one whole show?,"Why not one whole show? The sound quality is good, but why can't record labels just put one whole show instead of a collage of shows. I get really upset about this."
2,Not what I expected,I expected a natural product. They have different fragrances.Instead this is a scented salt with chemicals.May be the company changed the original natural formula of the old days long time ago.No thanks.
2,This is a Childrens Book,This is a book for children. I had no idea of that. It was not clearly marked as such. I would not have bought it had I known.
4,I've got a gun in my hand and I feel like a man...,"This is certainly one of the loudest and most furocious movie soundtracks that I've ever heard. It's both dark and energetic at the same time. My favorite songs are ""Bloodline"" ""Heads Explode"" ""Break You Down"" Swan Dive"" and ""Blind World"". The only reason I give this soundtrack four stars is because of ""One step Closer"" by Linkin Park. It sounds too teenage for this sort of CD. Otherwise, play this in your stereo, pump up the volume, and get ready to be blown away by Pantera, Powerman 5000, System of a Down, Godhead, etc.Grade: A-"
2,Missing song,What's the song that plays in the background when Dracula walks into the Virgin Record Store looking for Mary?
2,Brother MFC-8220 Laser Multifunction Center - used,"LOTS of paper jams - my old 4550 worked better. I like the paper tray beneath, it collects less dust, none the less I think that might have something to do with my paper jams.If I needed to use it a lot I would not want it at all.The front door would not open, when given extra effort it broke off the half moon part, seems to work better without it. Did I mention LOTS of paper jams? Eats lots of paper.When it came the plastic on the back was broke - does not seem to bother operation.I am James Elmer :-)"
4,Crosscurrent,"Artist is magnificent, BUT, after while all the songs begin to sound the same. Not too bad"
1,What will you get,Product title does not match description. Who knows what you will get. I wouldn't take the risk of ordering this one.
5,Fine Collection of Largely Unheard Embrace Gems,"I simply can't praise this band enough. Song after song, Embrace deliver some of the most beautiful and memorable melodies you've ever heard. Dry Kids is a collection of Embrace B-sides too good to be forgotten and relegated to hard-to-find and expensive (especially in the U.S.) UK singles. It's quite perplexing why some of these tracks were not used as A-sides, such as the glorious ""Milk and Honey,"" the powerfully building ""Maybe I Wish,"" or the warm, uplifting album closer, ""Waterfall."" It also has a few unique and surprising tracks, such as the cover of Eminem's ""How Come?"" and the mellow, psychedelic-flavored ""Feels Like Glue."" It's a must own for Embrace fans, a real treat for fans from the U.S., who possibly haven't had the chance to hear them before."
5,Una excelente selección del trabajo de Violeta Parra,"Las canciones de Violeta Parra son la base de la música chilena, sin ella, no hay origen, no hay rescate de las raíces. Sin su final, sin su suicidio, no hay historia para su tragedia, no hay futuro sin su pasado. Violeta, nombre de flor para una belleza que murió trágicamente. Pero su canto es la base de todo, o de todos, de todos."
3,Ok but not great,I listed this Thom Yorke debut album. It's an okey album ... there are good stuff in this electric & new age album. But there aren't & original material. This sounds very familiar. This sounds like Depeche mode in a few song & other times sounds like Björk albums.Fact to lack the others members of the band. I don't see the future in a single carreer for Thom. The principal problem of this album is the structure of the songs ... the voice of Thom is great ... but the structure of this album is the same for each song. The album results repetitive. But that's the problem when you aren't composer.
1,"Better luck next time, Yorke","I'm sorry to say this, but this album has me shaking my head. I paid $9.99 for this NEW on the day it came out, with it's terrible packaging and all. ""There must be good music in here,"" I thought to myself. I popped in the CD to get droning, repetitive elevator music with random blips and blops. Where is the talent? Thom Yorke's voice sounds monotonous and whiny on nearly every track, the exception being Atoms For Peace, the album's only redeeming song, where he hits some high notes pretty well. The Radiohead fanboys will eat this album up because, you know, it's Thom Yorke, their hero. Actually, that statement might not ring true. Even Pitchfork gave this album only a decent review, who are known for their rabid Radiohead fanboyism.Donate your money to a good charity instead, or save it up and buy the new Radiohead album when it comes out."
2,"i love radiohead; this, however, is WAY self-indulgent","blips bleeps more bleeps assorted blips yawns double-yawns scratchy samples of crackling record grooves plaintive yelps blips blippingtons tones scattershot ersatz poetry bleeps bleepings blah humbuglove, hamburg"
1,Self-indulgent drivel.,"This has to be one of the most un-listenable CDs I have ever had the misfortune of owning. Whining over annoying computer generated noise may be his right as an artist, but to actually sell this junk is shameful. Anyone remember Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music?"
4,a nice dreamy electronica album with vocals ~,"I think Thom Yorke's ""Eraser"" is an electronica album more on the experimental, ambient techno side, maybe similar to the soundscape and beats of Boards of Canada or Harold Budd.In terms of singing and songwriting styles, I think of Thom Yorke as the modern day Morrisey or Robert Smith, both figures represent the unsatisfied and passive intellectual types. Gone were the guitar sounds, this time with the latest electronic beats.Thom's voice reminds me of Jeff Buckley in some ways, and the arrangement on many songs were very layered, textured and creates a dreamy atmosphere much similar to many of the works of The Church.This is to say that Thom Yorke really takes a lot of influences from some of the best musicians from diffrent genres and combined them nicely with good production and promotion. The good thing is that he also managed to paste all these good stuffs together to create something of his own distinctive style.Recommended !S.K"
4,"Not the magic you might expect, but still a must have",I am a huge fan of every thing radiohead or it members do. The clearly have a vision for the music that many other musicians lack. Every album seem to be a progressive step covering new ground for them selves and sometimes for rock music in general. For all these reasons I was a little disappointed with the Eraser Thom York's solo project because I was expecting something very new sounding. With that said this album still is incredible. It sounds very much like a variation on Kid A. Which makes sense because I understand much of the music for this record came about from samples taken from the Kid A recordings. Even if the music was just mediocre you can get around Thom voice which takes center stage in this record do in part in the minimalism in the music. The best song has got to be 'And It Rained All Night'. If you like Radiohead this is a purchase you'll be very happy with.
2,Mainly forgettable,"Thom Yorke's solo album THE ERASER sounds mostly like home demos of rejected songs written for a certain famous band that he's in. The musical material is based on electronic loops and a few piano parts. There's a certain lack of polish, and only the first three tracks are really memorable: ""The Eraser"", ""Analyze"" and ""The Clock"". That leaves the bulk of the album pretty vacuous, and I find that the song ""The Eraser"" works much better in its remix by Sasha onInvol2ver.I'd recommend THE ERASER only to Radiohead completists. As decent as the first three tracks are, there's much merit to the claim that no one would ever look at this album were Yorke not the frontman for such a famous band."
3,More computer beeps but why,That is all this cd is there are some good songs on here but they are not worth buying this cd. Thom would have been better off just playing the guitar or piano with these songs and get rid of all those leftover Kid A beeps and such. People have mention on here that this is not Radiohead and should not be compared to them but this cd would not have been released if he was not the lead singer of Radiohead. Kid A happens to be my least favorite Radiohead cd i own and the only reason i listen to it more then once is becasue i bought it and it is not worth the time to sell it. My advice even if you are a fan of Radiohead is to listen to it first before you buy it but if i did buy it i would listen to it a couple of times then it would just collect dust in my cd collection.
2,Yorke goes Bjork,But sadly it flops. The electronic music has promise but it's not strong enough to help the terrible lyrics and vocals. One or two songs are half way decent and that's it. The packaging is awful! I don't really see the need for a paper holder that folds out to a 2 foot long art project. Maybe drugs are needed to enjoy this CD. Too bad.
1,Awful,"This album did nothing for me. Frankly, I don't know what people see in Thom Yorke-he is weird, his voice is annoying, has no range and the songs on this album aren't even that musical. A lot of self absorbed droning and whining."
5,5 stars,"This album grew on me pretty quick. At first I thought ""What is this..."" then it all made sense and i love it now. Definitely has a Radiohead feel to it, but don't expect the same. Thoms vocals are out of control, well worth paying to hear. this is music."
5,Tres bon,Another excellent album by the incomparable Francoise Hardy. It makes me wish I had grown up in 60s Paris.
2,booo,"rage against the machine is one of my favorite bands, but this cd was really dissapointing for the people who like the rock side of rage then the rap side of them. this cd is mostly concentrating on zack's rap skills, which are awsome, but i really like morello's riff's. if u wanna get a rage cd, stick with thier first album, it is the best."
3,I cannot believe it,"I don't know what went wrong with Rage, i mean, what happened? Most of these songs are just covers, not very much original stuff here guys. If you are a downhard RATM fan, then you should probably just get this CD just for the songs ""Pistol Grip Pump"" and ""Renagades of Funk"", cuz those are like the only great songs. If you are only a minor RAGE fan, then don't bother buying this CD. If you even lsiten to some of these songs, you would not belive its really RATM. In short, all I have to say is that RATM'S OLD STYLE HAS DIED"
2,poorly built,"this wasn't all that bad. a little kid with a ""gift"". a mother trying to escape with the kid. someone chasing them. standard stuff. the mad/evil scientist was a little too much, i mean, really. it lacked suspence. the mother and the child was a little bit too dull for me. talking to a waiter, thinking about whether or not they could afford a burger, etc. the book didn't really peek my interest. but the worst thing was the way the story was built. a little bit from the scientist's journal, the mother, the chaser, an so on. the book jumped from one scene to another."
1,Disgrace to the gay community,"This man is a crook. The fact that he is using his homosexuality as an excuse for the unethical things that he has done and continues to do is disgraceful! What is truly sad about the whole situation is: had McGreevey not been faced with a lawsuit and possible indictment, he never would have come forward as being gay, his family never would have known, and he would have continued having ""trists"" with random gay men. I wouldn't waste the time buying this book."
1,GIVING GAY A BAD NAME,"Jim McGreevy came out on my birthday and, as a gay man and ex-New Jerseyan, it seemed like a major step forward for the movement. This biography shows it was not. The subject of his own autobiography, Mr. McGreevey comes off as self-serving, shallow and emotionally remote and as a consequence much of what he writes comes off as implausible, deceptive and, at times, outright false. Save your time and money."
5,A realistic journey,"The Path to School Leadership gives aspiring principals a condensed, yet comprehensive look at the true lives of school leaders. Bolman and Deal include real-life scenarios, as well as helpful strategies for even veterans of the job. The authors also go over the basics of school leadership in a clear, but thorough approach. For being so concise, this book covered much of what I have learned in graduate school. It should definitely accompany principals in their schools and is worth a second look."
2,"Interesting possibilities, total let down","The family dynamic and somewhat plain style piqued my curiosity originally, but that quickly passed. These vignettes are brief, unorganized (both chronologically & stylistically) and uninteresting. The details seemed haphazard, combine that with minimal text that is still overly crafted and it becomes a jumbled mess. It seemed at times there were a few stories thrown in to spice up the memoir which only amplified the flat feel for the book."
4,no ending,I really like Mr. Block's writing - especially the Scudder series. This is my first Keller book - so I will try another before I pass judgement. This book really is well written and will hold your attention. I am just not sure if someone like John Keller really exists - although I don't know why I doubt it for a moment in this world we live in. I just hope no one I love runs into this guy anytime soon. Mr. Keller sure is lucky that no one has spotted him coming or going from any of these crimes huh???
2,Funk Bass,"Hm. It's Okay. Very repetitive... if they had given a couple bars, in a key, then you just went about it the rest of the way for the other keys, you'd be better off. the book is filled with sooo many pages of the same exercises in different keys. This is not supposed to be a music reader book, nor is it supposed to be a ""you VILL memorize these via muscle memory or else"" book... it's supposed to be a funk bass book, for technique. I'd have probably been better off getting something else. No, definitely. But to each his/her own. I dont recommend this though. I never even cracked the CD.. still in the book unused. It would pain me to listen to the same exercises over and over all the way up and down the fretboard."
5,Freekin Cool,"This is a phenominal album! It's become one of my standards and hasn't left my CD changer in five months. It has a great range of styles and artists but they blend wonderfully - great for parties. Some of it is really dancible, some more along the lines of super fun dinner party music. A great introduction to 1950's style funk / latin fusion. If you like Tito Puente or Babaloo or any ska band you must buy this album. Never mind the lack of samples, buy it anyway- you'll love it."
2,Not really worth reprinting,"Van Vogt is known for his prolific output of mediocre stuff. This book is a real van Vogt as per style and per themes, but it is pretty run of the mill. Even in the classics (Slan, Isher, Null-A, The Silkie) there are weaknesses. Weaknesses abound here, not really worth reading."
1,nigel get out of the boat,you now nothing of diesel engines you must be one of those fairy english diesel engineers get a job on hms sir elton john as you do not know a spanner from youre arse
1,Strap on some balls and start living instead! Gals and Guys! Seriously.,don't buy this line of BS. Take martial arts and learn some selfrespect and how to honor yourself and others worthy of your respectand like Tom petty suggests... (on the important stuff...) don't back down!
3,Beyond Codependency,This is an interesting book and would be better if the author were not so hung up on alcoholism and drug dependency. There are other forms of codependency and I wish the author would have explored those areas. I guess she only has one area of expertise.
1,MISLEADING,"I ordred two of these girls gone wild videos thinking that it is was the usual, but I got censored copies."
3,Fine but Pricy,"Only thing wrong is the price. 16 pieces of plastic for $10? Does what it should, parts made with attention to detail but expensive. I got a 64 drawer cabinet for about $40. If I wanted to put a divider in every drawer that's an additional $40! Umm. Something wrong there.(numbers rounded)"
5,Great product,Great product and excellent ride on my 05 gmc crew cab. Only downfall is that I notice the truck height is tiny bit lower than the stock shocks. Not a problem though. Rides like new again after 99000 miles on it.
5,Excellent!,This book is a great supplement in preparing for the AP US History Exam! Most of my friends (that had taken the exam) received 4's or 5's (mostly 5's!!)
2,one of disappointment .....,"An avid Lindsey fan I was most disappointed in the tale of Sheena and Jamie.This is the first Lindsey tale that I have found hard to stomach ... this was not a page turner for me! I found the storyline (kind of tedius) and characters (most annoying) quite substandard (for a writer like Lindsey!) .... I had to push myself to finish the book! This is NOT a book I will find myself reading ever again.I expect after reading some of Lindseys other novels I am used to a much higher standard of writing: thus, in three words my comment on this tale is ""one of disappointment""."
5,Loved it!,"It's awesome, sturdy and comfortable. Read through all the reviews and I don't understand the bad ones."
2,Ripped After First Flight,"I read all the other reviews, so I knew it was possible, but this bag tore on the bottom (not near any of the handles/straps as I expected) after my very first flight. I had an infant seat and base inside."
3,Fits Britax Marathon 70 purchased 2011,"I've used this bag about four times and it is not proving very durable. The zipper sometimes comes undone and I have to unzip all the way and rezip to re-engage the zipper teeth. Also, there is already a hole in the exterior fabric. The backpack straps are useful when your hands are full and no luggage cart is readily available but I'm not really happy with the purchase."
1,"Great concept, horrible quality.","This product was great at what it was suppose to do, protect my car seat but the quality of the bag was HORRIBLE. THE MATERIAL cracked and ripped like crispy plastic after the first use. The seams around the bag and shoulder straps came apart without even using the straps. For the amount that the item cost, I really wished the quality was better. I bought it based on the great reviews but was disappointed. Should have bought the cheaper one if I knew this more expensive one would have broke slightly after the first use. Besides the the quality of the bag, everything else is good as far as keeping my car seat protected."
2,great but ripped after first use,Fit our Britax perfectly but did rip on way back from Hawaii. Maybe the multiple exchanges was too stressful for the bag.
5,Great Buy,"We physically checked out various bags before making the purchase online. This bag was definitely the highest quality of the bags we saw. The bag fit our Graco convertible car seat perfectly, and it made traveling with a car seat so much easier! So glad we bought this. Well worth the investment."
5,This makes traveling with a car seat so easy!,This car seat carrier was the best. We recently used it for a cross country flight and the car seat arrived safe and sound. It was easy to carry it through the airport with the convenient backpack as well. Would recommend this to anyone traveling with a car seat.
4,Bulky but comfortable,I bought this for my first airplane trip where I had to take my son's car seat. I wanted something that could protect the car seat because I planned to check it.The backpack worked great. Although bulky (it could be registered as a deadly weapon in 9 countries) it was surprisingly comfortable. It left my hands free for luggage and the stroller (and an escapee toddler). I was also able to load it up with the diapers and wipes prior to checking it.It did sustain a hole the first time out but the tear is small and the fabric is tough so it won't enlarge. Obviously there is rough handling when it comes to plane cargo and with the strength of the fabric I don't think this was a fabric defect. The car seat seemed to arrive in good shape.I would definitely recommend this product especially if you plan on checking the seat.
2,Bring a sewing kit!,"We thought this bag would ease our cross-country plane trip with our infant. But the strap snapped as we entered the airport. After finding a sewing kit in the terminal, we were able to sew it back together. The bag held up for the trip back."
4,"Nice case, but concerned about long tern durability.","The Recaro car seat BARELY fits in this thing, but the seat is freakin' huuuge. It seems very well made, but, and this is a big but....After one trip, there is significant wear on the bottom corners. I was planning on using this thing for at least another year, and I usually fly with the kid 2-3 times per year. It may not make it in one piece. I guess that it is sacrificing itself for the good of the seat. I will probably end up putting some reinforcement patches on the corners. The backpack straps work well, but you kind of look like an enormous hunch back walking through the airport and getting in to elevators with this thing on can be funny."
5,Great travel bag,This fits our Britax Marathon car seat (which is really big). I totally love this thing because we travel a lot. It's so nice to have it in a backpack form instead of another roller when you are trying to get through the airport. I would buy it again in a second.
3,Evenflo Momentum doesn't fit,"The bag itself is quite nice. Padded sides, strong zippers, and comfortable straps. The problem is our car seat doesn't fit. We can get it zipped most of the way, but there's about a 10"" gap where the zippers just won't go anymore. We ended up securing them as close as they could go with safety pins.The backpack straps are essential, because we sure didn't have any extra hands to pull this along on wheels or otherwise.I can't find a bigger bag that offers the straps, so I guess we'll make do."
3,"Good, but a little tight for an Evenflo Symphony 65 E3","Fits a Evenflo Symphony 65 E3, barely. Took my wife and I to squeeze it in. If there was just a little bit more room at the top, it would be perfect.Solid build, but as other people had mentioned the zippers look a bit flimsy and cheap. Why they didn't out a heavy duty metal zipper is beyond me.We haven't taken it on a plane yet to see if it can hold up to baggage handlers."
4,Great for baggage check,"Just took this out for it's maiden voyage and it was fantastic! I checked my Chicco infant car seat with base and both arrived unharmed.The backpack feature was helpful to get up and down my 3 floor walk-up. I didn't carry through the airport this time but I'm sure it will be great on our next trip this summer.Super helpful purchase for our first air travel trip, well worth the money to keep my car seat safe and secure."
4,Great for the price,"We used this for my 1yo son's 2012 Britax Marathon. We bought him a seat on the plane with us, and used the car seat on the plane as well as to get to and from the airport on either side of the flight. It worked flawlessly for us, when I used it right. I'm 6ft tall with a long back, and when I sat the car seat fully upright, the weight was reasonably well distributed (with a little more than I'd like coming from the back edge of the bottom of the seat, which is why I'm giving this 4 stars; there should have been some extra padding down there).FWIW, when I used it wrong it was terrible. The first time I loaded the seat in here, I didn't sit it all the way up, I left it in the rear-facing and reclined position I took it out of the car in. It barely fit that way, and it put all the weight of the thing on the bottom edge of the seat, sticking out nastily into the small of my back. Don't be dumb like me and you won't have that problem."
4,"A travel ""Must-Have""","I'll start out by saying, yes this is a little costly. I had thought about not making the purchase due to the price, but in the end felt it would be much easier to handle our car seat while traveling. The straps are thick and padded, easing the strain on ones shoulders. It is helpful for transport from vehicle to airport, then back again. Especially when you are dealing with suitcases and children. We checked our car seat with the airline. When I received it back, there was a large hole in the bag. This was disappointing! But, thankfully I'm not buying another car seat instead. I have a Graco Nautilus 3-In-1 car seat, which I find large and bulky. So as far as size, the travel bag should fit most car seats."
2,"Worked a while, then broke","We took this on a couple of trips and then it broke. The zipper pulled away from the fabric, the nylon frayed so it got caught, then ripped. Now it's useless because it can't close. Also, it ONLY has backpack straps, so I guess I need to use it as a backpack because that's the only option."
3,Gets the job done,"Our seat (Römer King Plus) fit snugly into the carrier. The carrier held up through the transatlantic flight just fine -- no rips or broken parts. However, I made the HUGE mistake of trying to use it as a backpack (with my baby strapped on in front, like the guy in the picture on the package). Maybe this works well for big burly guys, but for me (petite female) it was way too heavy: I totally messed up my neck doing it. The only reason I did it was that I had too much luggage to fit on the cart ... travelling alone with a baby is tough!"

4,Complete Satisfaction,"I was looking for an introduction to the railroads of New Hampshire, and this volume provided the answer."
4,DVD or iTunes - Your Choice,"It is odd to sell it on DVD now when it's been on iTunes for several months with Season 1 3 and 4 not including bonus features. But where's season 2? I only seen one episode on regular TV with a Chevy Cavalier having dead rodents in the back seat.Season 1 and 3 are good, but season 4 has rude humor and I miss the WCC style. They replaced all the actors except Mad Mike and XZibit. Everyone else was replaced in the new garage.When are they coming out with Season 5 this 2007?"
5,at long last!,"""definitive"" is a an overused adjective... but this volume is indeed just that. ulin's winning (and sometimes surprising) selection of material captures the breadth and depth of a literary milieu artfully and evenhandledly. (ulin must be uniquely well read and/or uniquely familiar with his material - some of his choices, e.g. robert towne's intro to chinatown screenplay, are fun just to consider in a potentially crusty dusty Lirbrary of America anthology). forget the heavy intellectual (and physical!) weight of this tome -- this is no door stop or boat anchor, its a joyous sojourn in the searing sun. brevity, clarity and wit!"
1,Worthless!,"This is great music but this CD is literally worthless! That is because it will not play on any CD player I tried it with; home stereo system, car, boombox and my buddy's home stereo. The fine print on the jewel case says ""The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players."" Extremely disappointing! I have no idea why Jay-doesn't-care-about-his-fans-Farrar made it this way or amazon is still selling it? At least the amazon retailer gave me a prompt refund. Don't waste your time on this junk."
3,Not a complete return to form,"But still much better than anything Farrar has done in a long time...I like the quitar textures, like the more rockin' tempos, and these melodies stick a little bitter than those proffered on his solo releases. And, the band format makes for a more cohesive record...I look forward to the next release of this configuration of SV - hope they stick together..."
2,Sony Copy Protection,"This disc will not play on my PC, can't put it on my MP3 player, basically it is uselesss for anything I'd do with it. I don't download illegaly, and don't feel I should be punished for it especially since I purchased the media.Two stars, it is most likely a good album, but I can't hear it."
1,Spare us the futuristic multimedia stuff,"So far I have not even listened to this disc. I listen to everything on my MP3 player and computer, and have not even been able to get my computer to recognize it as a CD, much less burn it into mp3s.I find this type of thing extremely annoying. I did not buy the disc to have an adventure in the future of new media, and I don't give a crap about videos and DVDs. I just wanted to listen to the music.Concern about this type of thing happening actually kept me from buying an MP3 player and ripping in a library for a couple years. It's disturbing to see Farrar, who postures as politically radical, at the forefront of some kind of corporate, consumer-screwing protection racket."
5,I love the weather!,"I love the weather, and I love the Sims now have weather to add a new challange to the game!"
3,Had some problems with it,"The game was awesome but the problem is that the walls and floor will look red,pink and black,I check if it was memory card and I add more memory to my computer but is still wont work."
5,AWSOME!,I love the sims and Seasons added so much more to the game. Instead of the weather being the same all of the time there is now all four seasons for your sims to enjoy and new activities to go along with them! I love this pack!
4,Sims 2 Seasons Rock!!!!!!!!!!,"My Bro & I are hooked on this game! It has a new neghiborhood called Riverblossom Hills! Watch Out if you sims plant or spend a lot of time in the garden your sims could turm into Plant Sims! I like buliding a snowman, seeing the peguin, thunderstroms,Snow ball fights & water bloon fights are cool also If your sims are in the hot tub during a lighting storms they will get shoocked and turn all black to get rid of the lightning dust place your sim in a bathtub or shower. THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL SIMS 2 LOVERS!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome!,"I'm an avid Sims 2 player and the one thing I missed from The Sims was gardening. Now I can do that and so much more. No longer are the ponds around your house just pretty landscaping. Now you can actually fish in them! In addition, as with all The Sims 2 games, there's lots of new furnishings and careers."
3,One of the best protein bars on the market,"This is one of the best protein bars on the market. For 420 calories, you get 32 grams of protein and a bar that doesn't have any chemical taste whatsoever. Also, if you are a vegetarian, it is a good choice because it doesn't contain gelatin which as you probably know is made from dead cows, and is in A LOT of other protein bars because it is a cheap source of protein. One other thing--this protein bar is big, so it tends to be a little more filling which is important for those of us who practically live on these things.I've tried many, many, many different bars over the years. The only bar I like better is the peanut-butter pretzel flavor, so if you're looking for variation, give that one a shot."
1,cheap,"Barely sharp enough to go through fabric. I had to push hard just to get through a shirt. When trying to get them through anything else, they just bend."
3,A special work,"The content of the book should receive 5 stars, however the copy we received is a facsimile of the original, so its production is not rated very highly. Anyway, we were grateful to receive it. At the moment the book is with our translator to be put into Portuguese and eventually published in that language. So you see how highly we think of this work.Mary Barkley"
2,badly written,"Usually when reading celebrity biographies, you don't care whether they're well-written or not. But this is SO badly written, it does interfere with your enjoyment of the book. Nonetheless, there is good gossip in here, including Jerry Hall's note to Mick that a patron at a restaurant in Barbados found at their table after they left (we should all have wives/girl friends like Jerry!!) And Mick's gay encounters are documented here. Kind of yucky and shocking when you first read about them...but then you get used to them and think, Oh, well, it's rock and roll hedonism...."
3,Good,"I have enjoyed many of Ms. Drakes books. It isn't one of her best work. However this book was exciting and worth reading. The story will keep you wondering what's going to happen next, even if we all know there will be a happy ending."
2,Different from TV,I don't like this DVD because they just presented a summary about the whole story there a lot things you don't see. I can say that because I saw almost the half by TV and I just want to finish soon the time they show it is too late for me it is at 12:00 am. It is not a good choice when you don't see the story on TV.I don't say the same for the shipping it was excellent I got the item before the time I was expecting it.
2,"boring, boring , boring.",I read this book based upon the reviews listed here and was very disappointed. What were these reviewers thinking? This book was tremendously boring. I never really got the feeling that they were in danger. Im sure they were but it didnt come across too well. And there were just too many metaphors. One after another. I never could identify with either hiker. I had no image in my mind of what they looked like. Too many flashbacks I didnt really care about their past experiences. If i wanted cop stories i would take out a cop book from the library(i dont buy books). This book cant compare to books like Into Thin Air and Skeletons across the Zahara. Please read either one. They were fantastic.
5,Good read into the lives of the characters,"A book that is hard to put down. Never jnow which way this will turn, or what fate awaits the 2 characters. Obviously based on true events. Enjoyable."
3,"A lot of fun, but....","My daughter, who is 22 months, still loves this toy that we got for her 1st birthday. It drives me nuts though. She pulled on the microphone some and after a while it got so staticky that you could barely hear the music! I exchanged it for another (would have returned it, but didn't keep the receipt) but the same thing happened with the second one. She doesn't even pull the microphone anymore, but it's still a static nightmare. I can hear her bringing it down the hall - crackle, crackle, craaaaackle, craaaaaack! This would be a great toy without the mic. Would not buy this again."
2,Annoying,"I bought this toy because I could not resist the huge smile my 9-month-old got on his face when he saw it. When we got it home, my husband was constantly annoyed by the way it would ""harass"" our son. It would chatter for a bit after he went off to play with something else (for instance it would sing ""If you want to sing a song, play with me"" a few times after he crawled away). Then the microphone broke after a couple of weeks. I can see this is a common problem by reading the other reviews. After two months the toy broke completely and it won't work at all now."
5,Its Alive,In the beggining a mad scientist named Frankenstien and his assisant steal body parts.Frankenstien then has his assisant steal a brain but turns out to be an abnormal brain.Once when Frankenstien makes it alive it goes on a killing spree.
5,James Whale 's masterpiece!,"There have been countless versions around this mythic fable with the underlying statement of man playing tobe God. I'd rather say Dr. Frankenstein is an irreverent enemy of the Status Quo. Obvioulsy he has crossed a forbidden barrier, and the violation that limit will entail him an intersting lessonof life.The fundamental inside the dramatic structure is the great influence that wisely Whale took borrowed from the German Expressionism; those marvelous lights and shadows counterpoints and the impressive performance of Boris Karloff making of the creature, initially a clumsy monster who simply ignores all about the rules of the world.On the other hand you must remind the obligated reference to The Cabinet of Dr.Caligari; here you have : both dramatic premises that eventually, will interweave to create the most expressive and by far best reading of this legend.A cult movie for a long, long time."
3,Great classic in horrible packaging,"Obviously, anyone buying Frankenstein on DVD doesn't need to read reviews about how grate of a classic it is.The packaging of these Universal Legacy Series DVDs are HORRIBLE. I have returned 4 due to the actual disc trays inside the cardboard case not being adhered to the actual case. They just fell right out when I opened them.Also, one of them had a huge round sticker on the OUTSIDE OF THE BEAUTIFUL CASE!! It ruined it when I took it off. I would have left it but it was holding on a flapping piece of paper and had to be removed.I guess I will try the ""The Legacy Collection"" next time. At least the Creature form the black Lagoon is in that collection."
1,problem after problem,ive recieved this item and returned it 3 times already and i am still not happy and its too late to exchange it again so now im stuck.everytime i recieve this dvd its been damaged.mostly to do with the casing.its been damaged i think by bad shipping tecniques or something.also bad cover design.although the cover looks cool......it always falls apart first time you open it or there are major cuts in it.the movie itself is a classic and is awesome.just wish they packaged it differently.especially for those like myself who love movies and collect them.
3,They fixed my problem.,"The shocks from Rancho fixed the problem I had with my 2001 Mercury Mountaineer. The problem I had of nearly losing control of my truck when I hit bumps while driving into a curve. The tires really hold the road well with the 5000's. It isn't as smooth as I had hoped but it's an ""All Terrain"" shock. One can't expect it to ride like a Cadillac."
3,New Balance Walking Shoes,"The shoe is a comfortable shoe and padded nicely, but the problem I had was with the width in the ankle part of the shoe. That part of the shoe is very wide and felt stretched out. I had to put a sock on to try and take up some of the space in that area."
5,Firepower the greatest death ring movie of all time,"Firepower is one of the best films in it's genre. This is a movie that has very little plot but is huge on action. It is one of the best ""Deathring"" movies of all time... The hellzone is certainly a highlight as well as the ""futuristic cop car"" aka the chevy lumina van..."
2,Little Richard vinyl,"The album is so so, not what i expected, doesent sound like the original from back in the day.Am thinking is was remastered or something, will be more dilagent next time."
3,"Excellent book, but missing some important observations","I enjoyed Bridges lofty view of God and his easy writing style. However, I came to the book looking for more and didn't get it. Bridges should have developed the most important basis for fearing God in more detail. We reap what we sow. Paul Reminds us ""do not be deceived, the wrath of God visits those who do such things."" I put this book down disappointed that the author did not develpt this important theme. I came to this book hungry to know why I should fear God, and came away partially satisfied."
4,Oriental Herbal Cook Book for Good Health,"I purchased the book for my mom for her birthday. I've never been into Chinese herb myself, but she prepared a couple dishes that I thought was pretty good. My mom seems to enjoy the cook book. She contantly tells me how this one dish is good for what part of the body. A great book for moms whom cook and are interested in Asian herbs."
2,Very disappointed,"Although I loved the color (Maldives) for summer, the texture of the multiple was dry and cakey. It went on rough and was messy in the tube. I'm sticking to powder blush from now on."
2,clay texture,"I have used Nars for years and have been happy with many of their products, this however is not one of them. The texture of the stick is very very dry which made the product go on very unevenly. I would not purchase this product again--surprised at the lack of quality."
2,Van Til: Man-Eater,"Cornelius Van Til was a modest and self-effacing man. I knew and liked him. But he was an unkind and often ferocious writer. His kind of Christian apologetics is outdated by this time, so there is not much to say--except that if you are going to believe in God by faith, no matter what, why not just say so and quit writing these interminable books which urge you to believe in God by faith?"
1,dissatisfied,"I bought this for my 2 year old grand daughter, she was not impressed when it wouldn't fit in her game. This game is for the regular Learn through Music not the Learn through Music ""touch pad"". It does not say anywhere in the description about what game this cartridge is for."
3,Dora the explorer learn through music,"My daughter recently turned two and recieved this for her Birthday. At first it was very cute, but hearing that song over and over again can get quite annoying. My daughter loves it though. It is somewhat educational."
2,Didn't care much for it,"I love baba Ghanoush, and make it from time to time and also buy it refrigerated and love it, but didn't care much for this. Very bland and you have to add garlic, lemon, and olive oil yourself. Buy it in the tub from a hippy food store."
5,Jack O,I found the quality of this cd was up to par with my expections. delivery was in a timley manor. great things happen when listining to native music!
2,The Collapse of Ancient States and Civilizations-returned the book,"this copy is small print, difficult to read. I returned the book and am still waiting to hear back from amazon.com to return my money or just give me some credit.also your suggestions are not very clear to follow (i.e. tag this product) what does it mean and how to do it?I tried calling you for customer help, no such thing, tried to email, it didn't work.Have you got too many customers to care???Agnes Denes"
4,Sideshow=Alive on the Inside,"This has more ""new"" sideshow in it than ""old."" I was hoping for more ""old"" footage, but it's O.K. If you want more ""old"" sideshow footage, buy Todd Browning's movie ""Freaks."" Old, original, and very, very cool. I can't get enough of the ""old"" sideshow. The people in the sideshows were amazing people, who weren't looking for pity or a handout. They worked hard for their money, and many of them retired together in Florida to a very comfortable life. God bless them all."
4,A good read -- but a few hiccups in the plot,"This was an enjoyable yarn, written with Foster's easy touch and sense of character.My sole complaint was with a few glaring problems with continuity that spoiled the story for me somewhat. (It's hard to give an example without giving away the storyline, but watch for references to the characters' eyes.)Despite the technical goofs, I still enjoyed the book, as I've enjoyed nearly all of Alan Dean Foster's works."
4,"Thankfully, I don't need to use it!","I hopefully won't need to assume that role again. We have an excellent receptionist AND vet tech, who I'm sure have both read to implement in my husband's practice."
5,Milo - A Colorful Character,"The author presents an ideal teaching tool for young children. Nicely illustrated, it teaches reading while instilling values at an early age. She makes interesting poetic plays on words and writes in a witty style that adults will also appreciate. Concise, clever, and insightful, it's an enhancement to any library."
5,A Great Fundamental Book on Fabric Dyeing,"This book has everything you need to begin hand-dyeing fabric to use in quilts. The instructions are complete and understandable. It has a complete list of the equipment and materials needed to begin. Color charts, formulas, dyed fabrics, finished quilts, and quilt patterns are all included. I love this book!"
5,A must have for Joe Dassin fans,"If you have just discovered the music of Joe Dassin, this disc may not be your first choice. You might want to get one with his most famous songs like ""Champs Elysees"", ""Et si tu n'existais pas"", ""L'ete Indien"", etc. On the other hand, if you want to expand your collection you will be pleased with this disc. Both sides of Joe Dassin's talent - humorous and lyric are well represented here. The song ""Que sont devennes mes amours"" is, in my opinion, one of his most beautiful ones. If your French is not very good - listen often. The clear pronounciation of Joe Dassin will soon help you understand the lyrics. Enjoy."
2,Wrong sizing,"The product would have been perfect but the sizing is about two sizes smaller than actual. I had to return all three camisoles. I didn't trust reordering the product, so I didn't. Sorry. This is the truth."
2,Time FIller,"This book is good for a time filler. Example...I read it before bed and during my breaks at work. However, I didn't find it a serious, mindblowing, fascinating read. There were some interesting parts of the story, but I was mostly bored. Maybe it's not my style, but, I'd rather not spend my time on boring poetry and an overdramatic portrayal on life."
4,Pretty good,"Raising Fences is the life story of, a the great writer Michael Datcher. A young black man trying to make it in today's society, living in bad neighborhoods, trying to find love. The part when Michael's mom battle with the white lady who knew karate, who's dog bit Michael was so funny. I wish the book would have more parts about him and his wife Jenoyne."
5,Speak My Brotha,If like me you are a woman and have always wanted to know about the thought process of a blk man then this is the book for you. M. Datcher does a great job of navigating us through his mind and life. Great read and an important read especially for the women out there playing that trifiling baby daddy game.
4,Teasing!,"I guess with all the side projects there is no time for the original band to make records. I like this album, but at 38 minutes its only a sampler. (I mean you can put twice as much on a CD! Come on guys!!) My desire to hear new music by Los Lobos is not fulfilled; just when the album is warming up it ends. What I hear is nice, what I don't hear is not worth my dollar."
1,What a waste,"This book is riddled with mistakes as if no one edited it. It is very dry and hard to read. It is muddled and the point is often lost. The authors often use strings of studies without bothering to tie them together or suggesting what real information we should be getting from it. Out teacher stopped using half way through the semester.Here's a paraphrased example from the book.Study x sort of shows y.Study c sort of shows the opposite of y.Study w shows nothing related to y, but somewhat related to x.Overall, that is how flooding works.Lets talk about PTSD for no reason for one paragraph at the end of the chapter.Oops we spelled ""comorbid"" wrong. Lets not bother to fix it. It'll make the book more interesting. God knows we're so boring we make the DMV seem like a roller coaster.The authors of this book should be ashamed."
3,Not too original,"Enjoyable, but not original. Great if you've never read a novel by an Indian author before. Well-crafted words, but the character development isn't full."
4,Interesting read,"This was an interesting read. I have taken an interest in India for many years, and this book, I think, brought to life things which wouldn't have worked for me in another story. I like the way the author weaves the tale around Vishnu, the poor porter lying dying on the staircase of a small apartment building. Although you get to see glimpses of his past life that is now coming to a close, you also get to see what is going on around him. The quarrels between the Hindu and Muslim/Sikh neighbors, the inner quarrels of marriages arranged long ago, the modern, Western ways creeping upon the youth who live there. I enjoyed this story, albeit rather sadly (it is essentially a drama), it transported me, and I think that is a mark of what all good reads should do."
5,Compelling read,"Loving all Indian literature, always looking for interesting novels, this book by author Manil Suri captures the reader from the very first page. The characters are well developed, you as the reader can comprehend the human frailties, their fears, the love & some intense dislike & anger. One can feel,through the authors use of descriptive language, the very atmosphere of life in a lower/middle class families home, the trials & tribulations of marrying your daughter well, of educating your child. The author shows us compassion for Vishnu, his awful degrading life, living between the stair well, the ; there for the grace of the divine go I. The tenants use of his services, the forced charity they offer him, in the hope that they are seen doing "" good"""
1,Dwindling patience,"Normally I am a patient person who can sit through even the most daunting of books, but not this one. The book began quite well and seemed to be turning into quite the spiritual experience (in reference to Vishnu's ""flashbacks""). Somewhere along the way the self absorbed inhumane characters began testing my patience at every turn. My anxiety increased until I decided that if I tried to read the whole book I may start believing that hitting myself over the head with it may be less frustrating than ""watching"" these people bicker over the mundane details of their hopelessly dead end lives instead of recognizing the true spirituality in life and death, as Vishnu is finally doing (in his death, which I guess is supposed to be the author's attempt at irony????). One the whole I would not recommend this book, save for the first half. (FYI I did read the whole thing just so I could write this and my worst fears became reality, it didnt get any better)"
5,Biscuit books,All Biscuit books are great and this one is great for kids with puppies/dogs and a new baby. My grandchildren love them and read them a lot.
4,Great kid's book on Kennedy,"My parents bought me most of the books in this series when I was a kid. They were one of my favorite treasures. I'd hoped to give them to my kids one day--instead, they were given to a relative and sold at a garage sale! (thanks, amazon, for making them available again!)So, I bought it for my son, but I also bought it for myself, to see again the books I once loved. This is a great introduction to Kennedy, written, I might add, not long after he was assassinated. It had almost a current news feel to it, at the time."
3,It felt like there were missing parts to the story,"This book does get into the mind of a twelve-year old girl, but doesn't always go into detail. For instance,why is Frankie afraid of the dark? Why does she hang out in her kitchen with her cook and six year old cousin? What does she do to other kids her age that made them say she was too mean? It definitely could've used more details."
1,This is not what I thought I was buying,"I got duped on this one. It's not a reading of the novel, as I'd hoped,but rather a theatrical reading. I need a refund.Rus"
1,Doesn't this girl ever shut up???,"Frankie Addams aka F, Jasmine has got some serious problems. Not only does everyone treat her like a baby but she fantasizes about traveling the world with her brother and sister-in-law. The majority of the book covers 3 days prior to the wedding, which is just a lot of talk. The wedding is covered in two pages which is a disapointment considering the other 99/100 of the book build up tension toward thus very unclimatic climax. With the exception of a couple passages (I ejoyed theare ""they we of me"") the book is full of useless mumble jumble.Don't waste your brain energy!"
1,I HATED THIS BOOK,"okay so i thought this book was going to be an easy read, since it looked so short. it was perfect for getting some end of the summer reading cramming done. i thought it'd be done with in an hour, which is usually how long it takes me to read books this length. WRONG. the story was so confusing that i read the same page over and over, it had absolutely no plot, and the whole thing was just so dull that before i could turn one page i would be falling asleep. And then, at sometimes, things are just so sudden and outrageous its like,""whoa, where did THIS come from! "" that i just wanted to throw it against a wall, and that is exactly what i did. please, please do not read this book. its not worth your time!"
1,extremly uninteresting,"The only reason I read ""The Member of the Wedding"" is because I had to write a research paper about it. I found the novel disorganized,and extremly boring. There was almost no action in the novel. The book is very difficult to read and understand. When you finish reading the novel you feel like the book is missing some pages, but it is not missing any. In ""The Member of the Wedding"" there wre some good points describing the problem of youth, but in general I think it was a poor written novel."
3,Avid Reader,This is one of those cases where the movie was better than the book. Very monotone in the series of depressing characters and events. Disappointing.
4,member of the wedding,"Keep your interest. This authur lived in Columbus, GA which is where I am from, so a lot of the book related to places in older Columbus."
2,Bush's Fault,"Alexander had more troubles in Bactria than in any other part of his empire. Most people who have a reasonable knowledge about his life will recognize this. He couldn't soulve his problems there with a single battle or siege, so he had a series of skirmishes, ambushes to finaly ""pacify"" the country.But the author's necessity to present his case against George Bush is so strong that he deliberately paints the war as hopeless from the beginning. But the truth that anyone can grasp from the book is that: Alexander remained in Bactria for just one year, and that was enough. An army of greek veterans (actually, soldiers old enough to be relieved from the main army) which represented only a small fraction of the macedonian army was able not only to control the country for 200 years, but to spend most of this time fighting against each other since other threats were not present."
2,It's a BIG dust ball...,"I really liked the concept of this item. However, from the picture provided, I was under the impression that it was a cute little dust ball that would hang from my partner's office window and subtly say ""I like dust balls."" When I received it, I was surprised to find that this ""little"" dust ball is actually quite large - roughly an 8"" diameter, much bigger than the picture indicates. I wish the seller had given some indication of this, as I most likely would not have bought it otherwise."
3,VERY PRETTY,"THE NECKLACE IS LOVELY, BUT I JUST DID NOT THE SIZE OF THE BEAD. THEY WERE TOO SMALL FOR MAY TASTE. HAD NO PROBLEM RETURNING."
3,Price,"The price is high, especially with me being a returning customer year after year. For my loyalty, I would really appreciate some price consideration. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to voice my opinion.Helen"
3,It works,Very satisfied with this replacement bulb. I hadn't noticed my picture quality deteriorated until I installed the new one.
5,AWESOME,"I purchased this product in 2010; it is now 2013 and still works as good as new. When my Sony TV's lamp stopped working I thought I would have to buy a new TV, but after reading TV manual, I decided to try replacing the lamp... it was so worth it and very easy to replace (no tools needed)."
4,Works... But you have to do a little tweaking...,"The housing that comes with this lamp is not OEM. But its ok, its the lamp itself that you need. Like everyone else pointed out you need to watch this video on youtube: [...]Oce you take out the new lamp from the housing, just follow the video to replace the lamp using your old (OEM) housing and it will work fine.Very Happy!"
4,Sony xl-2400 replacement lamp,"Lamp arrived as advertised complete with housing. Takes less than one minute to replace. Didn't even need the owner's manual for directions. Simply open access door on right side of tv, pull old housing out and replace with new housing. Only reason it didn't get five stars is because it does not seem as bright as the original when it was new."
4,My new Sony XL-2400 lamp,So far so good. Everything went well. It was easy to install. We will see if it lasts as long as the first one.
3,Short life,This lamp was shipped fairly quickly so there is no problem with the vendor. The product itself fits well and was easy to install. The only problem was the lifespan. My replacement lamp just went out last night after 8 months. The description claims 2000 hours but I think we only got about 900. Overall its an OK purchase but I am now looking for a more expensive model... maybe we will get to 1k hours
1,P.O.S.,"Wow, really poor product. I put this in my tv 2 months ago, it worked fine from the time I installed it, and with absolutely no warning it died. The screen didn't go dark or anything. I guess it's time to fork out the cash for a new tv."
3,Lamp,It seems a little slow coming on. Loved the price. This is first replacement bulb in 6 years. Great tv.
1,NOT a sony brand product,"First off this is a generic replacement, not branded by sony. Secondly, upon GENTLY attempting to insert the new lamp housing, the pin in the plug got pushed back into the housing, rendering this item 100% useless. This is a cheapo piece of garbage. Spend the extra money and buy one from SONY. Lesson learned."
1,Did not work with my Sony KDF-E42A10,"I tried and tried and tried but this item did not work with my Sony KDF-E42A10. After giving up on the housing, I put the new bulb in the original housing. The TV was not watchable during the day and very dim at night with max brightness. I purchased the original Philips bulb to resolve my issue. In comparison, if I rated the Philips bulb a 10, this one would be a 0."
2,Product worked for 6 months and 1 day- warranty for 6 months only,"We've purchased other replacement bulbs in the life of this 8 year old TV. The first one lasted two years, next one lasted a year and a half and this one- only six months and one day. We contacted the seller and were told that the warranty was only for six months. We placed the order on June 8, 2011...paid extra for shipping to expedite delivery and didn't receive it till June 14 (thanks Dynamic Lighting for reminding me of my mistake in the actual delivery date). Anyway, six months and one day- bought a new TV that doesn't require a bulb to work. This clearly isn't worth the money you pay for it if it doesn't work- yet, the price does keep coming down. Perhaps others have found the same and are no longer buying bulbs since they don't last. Good Luck!"
2,Not sure how compatible this lamp is with our TV,"I ordered this lamp assembly for our Sony WEGA 46"" LCD TV. The new lamp came on time (overnight) and very well protected by lots of bubble wrap.The install process was a breeze, though I had to struggle to get the new lamp housing seated correctly. It took several attempts but finally got alignment and we had a solid picture.Things were skipping along for about 3 or 4 days without any problems, then we would experience the set turn itself off and back on. Sometimes it threw off your viewing location within the program (if watching a recorded program). That happened a few times, then got worse on the third day of the problem. I had saved the ""old"" lamp and replaced the new lamp with the old one. We now have a stable picture again, and I'm returning the new lamp and purchasing a different one, hoping for better experience."
2,Lamp blew out in 6 months,"I purchased this replacement lamp 6 months ago and has already blown out on me. I contacted the seller, Camsdigital, and they refused to help."
2,Blub life,Got it to my house pretty fast put it into my tv as soon as I got it and turned it on message on the tv says. Lamp near end of life
3,GRAND WEGA REPLACEMENT LAMP,"I actually thought this was a OEM lamp when ordered. It turned out being a PHILIPS brand. Seems to work OK, time will tell regarding longevity & whether or not the lamp will match up to the SONY OEM. Original lamp never failed, it just started getting dark, the PHILIPS replacement is definitely brighter, colors are distinct and seem crisp. I believe PHILIPS has a good product name, I hope this replacement can live up to expectations. The seller was fast on shipping & the item was packed very well."
1,Did not work!,installed as per instructions--sound restored but no picture --for a long time only green and red lines after 2 hoursone short red line on the screen but no picture--i think the lamp was defective.
5,Sony XL-2400 Replacement Bulb,"Finding the product was easy on Amazon! Installation of the bulb was a cinch, ordered the bulb and received it in a timely manner. I was a little worried about installing the bulb, I am not very mechanically inclined but like I said no problem."
2,NOT OEM,"Title says OEM but it's not. Philips is OEM.Was a total pain to get in.It works, but for how long?"
1,Unhappy with first replacement lamp,I bought my first lamp from Amazon.com in June of 2011 and that replacement lamp only lasted about 8 months. I was not pleased with that purchase so I bought another and so for it is working. I would expect to get at least 3-5 years out of a replacement lamp as the original one lasted 6 years.
3,Not too happy,"Approx 18 months ago I purchased a Sony xl-2400 replacement lamp. I heard a loud pop on my tv and it went blank. I checked the lamp and it just exploded in the tv. I sent an e-mail to the manufacturer and of course I did not receive a response about a possible warranty. Obviously, they do not want to hear about any warranty. On my original shipment, I received no paperwork about anything.I did buy another one because of the price, but, once again no paperwork whatsoever about anything. If you buy this lamp from this manufacturer just be careful."
3,Ordered 2,"Got two of them to stock up glad I did the first one blew with in the first day (returned). The second one working fine, would have been very disapointed if not having the second one."
2,Lamp did not last as long as expected.,This replacement lamp blew out without warning in less than 2 years which is less than the expected lamp life.
2,A&JForever,"Re Sony Wega Replacement lamp.XL-2400I returned the first one because it left a streak across the top of my screen.The 2nd one,does as well.Sony XL-2400 Replacement Lamp for Grand WEGA 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV"
4,tv projection bulb,For the price this bulb met my expectations. The picture projected is a little narrower than the orginal but for the price I paid I am satisfied.
2,Faulty Housing,After purchasing and fighting with the install I see several reviews about the housing not fitting. Most of the housing is pretty much identical but the problem is with the two electrical pins on the bottom. The molded plastic around them is a little bit different than the original and are very hard to push in. I never could get it to seat all the way in so the red light would stop blinking. Went ahead and removed the bulb and placed it in the old housing. Will be buying just the bulb next time.
1,"Junk. They do not back the 6,000 hour rating","I purchased this and used it for a good week or two. After a dispute with my cable company I canceled and went to watching a movie every couple of days with as little time as I had. A month ago things slowed down and I have cable again only for this thing to burn out.They do not back the 6,000 hour rating. You would save more buying a new tv after a couple years of this."
3,Some problems with this lamp.,"This lamp is really slow as it takes 40 to 45 seconds to come on compared to about 15 seconds for the old lamp. Sometimes it will not even come on and causes a red light (lamp problem indicator) to appear on the front side of my TV. I removed the lamp and replaced it back into the television and made sure that everything was secure and a couple of days later the ""red"" light came back on again. I am not sure whether to keep it or return the lamp to the supplier. It has a 4 month warranty, but who knows if it will make it that long."
1,Did not work,Tried a phillips bulb after this one. the phillips worked fine for me. The case and some of the contacts were different which is what could have made the difference.
1,"item says by sony, it is not oem","the item description says this item is by sony, it is indeed not an oem bulb. the bulb i got was defective. it would run for about 2 minutes and the tv would shut off for 30 seconds and repeat. i even tried the suggestions of the previous reviewers and swapped to the oem housing. returned for a refund. the company i got it from had great service, they even paid shipping back. the bulb gets an F but the seller gets an A+ for service."
4,Excellent price,"IT was so great to know Amazon sold this replacement lamp as Sony's website has it for almost $200.The only negetive is that our TV takes longer to turn on/warm up, than it did with the original lamp by Sony.No big deal really but to be honest that is the only difference between lamps that we can tell so far.The price tops it all."
1,Replacement Projection Lamp,"I am thoroughly disappointed in the purchase of this item. I am writing this review exactly one year from the purchase date. Starting 7/14/2011 I began getting notices on the TV screen indicating that the projection lamp is burning out and needs to be replaced. The original Lamp bulb lasted from the purchase date of the TV(8/2006) until (7/2010), now I am having to replace it again already. What a waste of money! If you are unfortunate enough to own a TV that requires these expensive lamps, buy them directly from Sony."
1,AVOID MARGIN MART (Amazon Marketplace Seller),I purchased a tv replacement bulb. It did not work and margin Mart did not reply to my emails. It says to call them but there's no number or address. I disputed the charge with amazon who helped me get a response from the seller and an address. Then I sent it back and it's been a week since they received it and still no refund. This seller is not worth your time or effort I would not buy from them. This process has now taken over a month and I haven't got my money back.
5,DIdn't have to buy a new TV!!,"Once our TV went out, the first thing we thought was, OK, it's time for a new TV. I saw that the light blinking was for the ""lamp"" I decided to look it up on YouTube before completely giving up. There we have it, I saw how easy it was to replace the lamp. Bought it here on Amazon and had a working TV in no time. It took longer to clean off all the dust inside the TV than it did to replace it. It's a no brainer to fix and I couldn't be happier!"
1,Disappointed,"Looked like the real deal. Easily installed. TV screen prompt that projector lamp needed to replaced continues to show on the screen when tv is turned on which suggests this is not a new bulb. Also there is an orange line at the top that runs the entire width of the tv screen. Problems caused by Hurricane Isaac made me miss the deadline for returning this product. Should have bought the bulb from Sony because this one is probably reconditioned and will not last. The cost was considerably less than buying from Sony, but you get what you pay for."
1,Too good to be true!,"The bulb did not fit in my particular TV. The unit looked exactly the same, in fact identical except that this ones quality is not the same."
2,Lasted 8 months,"I bought this item from Dynamic Lighting on July 2, 2011 for my Sony KDF-50E2000. My original bulb lasted exactly 4 years, which I think is appropriate for my usage. I average approximately 6 hours a day of use (1 hour in the am, 4-5 in the pm). Eight months after purchasing this replacement bulb I am back purchasing another bulb. The first one cost me $82 and this one costs me $52. I know that the OEM bulb is $200, but I've read reviews about that one on the sonystyle.com website that indicates that that bulb doesn't last much longer either (certainly not the 4-5 years like the original bulb). I just want to post my experience so that others may be aware that their ""new"" bulbs may not last for more than a year."
1,Bogus Lamp,"The lamp I received causes my TV to stall multiple times during start up; the lamp and its box showed no evidence of being made by Sony. My best guess is that, despite having installed the lamp firmly, it does not seat itself properly.The stalling may cause the the TV to fail beyond the lamp.Do not buy; even if you get your money back, you'll still be out the money it takes to ship this bogus lamp back.This is the first time I've had bad luck in a purchase made through Amazon.Amazon should have vetted this supplier more than took place.NormanS"
1,Only WORK FOR 2 MONTHS,AT THE BEGINNING WAS PERFECT BUT RIGHT NOW I AM W/O TV AGAIN. I TOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER QUALITY BUT CHEEP COST A LOT.
1,Overheats and smells like its burning.,My tv does not work and has to shut down to cool constantly. Waste of money honestly and I don't recommend purchase.
3,Cute Chimp,"He's a cute chimp, very soft, and lives up to the Gund name. Our grandson loves to cuddle him when he is tired. We thought the chimp would be a bigger hit since our grandson loves monkeys but mostly this cute little guy sits on the bed...."
3,Book should be Crochet for Girls,"I was dissappointed but not surprised that there were only 2 - 3 patterns for boys and the rest were for girls. The patterns for GIRLS are ok. If you can , please try to get a look at the inside before you purchase."
4,Cool piece of history,"Most of the songs are a really nice representation of all the things Seeger supported. It's more tilted toward organized labor than peace. Some of the songs are less than professional versions of the songs for which he is known - I guess it is because the recordings are quite old (nearing 50 years!). If you like folk music, it's a nice buy, but get it at a cheap price because it isn't something you'll listen to over and over again."
2,"Great songs, weak production values","I purchased this CD in order to get a nice digital copy of ""Had I a Golden Thread."" I like most of the selections (heavily union songs) but just wish that the producers had taken more trouble to make excellent versions of each song. I often wondered why a track was selected because Pete Seeger sounded as if he were having a bad day or it seemed as if the studio were using bad mikes or recording equipment.On the more positive side, there are at least twenty-six songs, which is a lot for a single CD."
5,Excellent,"This is a Seven Devils book. Here is what it says on the back cover:""ONLY ONE WOMAN HAD A MARK LIKE HERSOr so Sheriff Zack Dalton had thoughts. Still, even with the promise of a long-lost family, it took all of his persuasion to convince vulnerable siren Honey Carrington to visit his mountain ranch. Only when he had her home in his arms did he admit he wasn't sure who the mysterious beauty was--or what secrets she harbored.Honey knew she wasn't the woman the Daltons had been searching for, and considering the way her heart raced whenever Zack was near, that was good! But she was desperate for a place to hide so she went along with the scheme. Still, could she really risk her life--and her heart--to keep her secret safe?"""
4,One of the great forgotten Canadian albums,"Chances are you stumbled through the musical South Pacific to finally end up here. 'Constance' rode the coatails of post-rock/orchestral soundscapes early in the decade, eg, Godspeed You Black Emperor, only to precede the likes of Broken Social Scene and Sigur Ros. South Pacific combines velvet white-noise, the techno ambience of early Aphex Twin, and breezy shoegazers Slowdive. More instrumentalists as they are musicians, one way to describe 'Constance' is atmospheric, and if you can find it, one of the brilliant albums to come from north of the border."
1,Burn 55 Dollars rather than buy this book,"When you write a text, the idea is to convey some sort of information. This text did nothing of the sort. Often the text is highly ambigious. The code the text gives is hard to understand, and if you are trying to implement a compiler while reading the text, prepare for a nightmare's worth of problems. Any type of implementation related to this text is a complete joke. Be prepared to waste a lot of time trying to figure out what the author should have said or said in a way that is very confusing. In addition to implementation part of the text being laughable, the theory portion is equally bad. Answering simple questions on the reading is very difficult due to the poor writing. I can think of no other book in which I have put so much time, and have gotten such little information."
2,Not for me!,"I started out using the Nature's Way Reishi Mushroom and decided since I take 6 per day that I would try to get a cheaper brand that had a larger quantity. Problems started right away though, my skin started breaking out within the first 3-4 days of switching to this brand, and I felt pretty nauseous. I gave it a month on these and now I am back to the Nature's Way. Maybe it was the blend of mushrooms in this one that made me feel ill, but it definitely was a poor experience compared to the others that I started with. Would definitely recommend Nature's Way with 10% Polysaccharides. They have helped my skin, hair, and joints to feel better. I am 39 years old with early arthritis symptoms and I also have severe adult onset acne. The acne is almost gone since I've been taking Reishi for 2 months now. and my general well-being has improved greatly."
2,Mandatory makeover,"2 1/2This unfulfilling combination of rougher Stereolab and Le Tigre electro-rock-pop-rap elements sounds pretty stale, if maintaining a low consistency."
1,Item only worked for a short time.,I was glad to see that I could replace my old transformed with the same make and model item which I found on Amazon. Price was fair and item was shipped and arrived promptly. The transformer worked well for a while and then began to function intermittently. Now the item has ceased to function at all. Since 60 days have passed I'm not sure how I can get a replacement for what I believe is a defective item.
5,Perfect in either language!,"I just bought this album today, and it's totally awesome! I really got into it and I think it'll help me out a lot, because I'm a second year French student. Céline Dion est très formidable!"
5,Unexpected treat,"The instrument that is central to this CD was first invented by Benjamin Franklin. It's a series of graduating glass bowls connected in the center by a rod of some kind. The whole thing turns and the edge of the bowls are played by hand. At least, that is what I understand of the instrument and it's history. Reagardless of whether you understand the mechanics of the device or not, the music is wonderfully restful, enjoyable and tranquil. I use it for my yoga sessions. I'm really pleased the insturment has been found is being played again."
1,junk,"total worthless, might be okay if you have full use of your hand and fingers. way too hard to adjust, just dont waste your cash. good concept very poorly constructed you have to apply a lot of presure to get all the strings to chord and then they buzz. i was very disappointed. [...]"
2,Legs rip off too easily,"My dog LOVED this toy. It was easy to squeak, and she loved that the legs stuck out like little party favors. However, within 2 hours, she ripped off 3 of the 6 legs. I can't buy these Premier Latex toys. They just don't last. :("
3,Maggie,This is a depressing film about a single mother sort of trying to get better. The only reason for the 3 stars is Maggie Gyllenhaal who is superb.
3,Good acting but a depressing movie of the effects of drugs,"The acting was quite good but all the wonderfully shaped cleavage and close ups of her from behind and bending cheapened her otherwise good performance. My negative feelings result from the hopelessness of her life and the only likeable character being her brother, and that took a while to develope. I was concerned why her patrol officer gave her so many breaks in the beginning that lead to her down fall. Did her father always molest her and did that lead to her inevitable down fall? Her use of her body to get a job, housing and drugs tells of the perpetual downward spiro. This along with her inability to resist re-addition tells the terrible tale all should heed. VERY GOOD movie but not a cheerful one and not even a good cry, just an over all feeling of depression. Its message is simply about the hopelessness of drugs and sex that leads to an attitude and conduct she does not really see, that would continue to drag her down."
4,Must See,"WOW i have a whole new level of respect/adoration for maggie G , this movie kept my attention and even though her character selfish and an addict you cant help but root for her and hope she gets better!"
2,Sherrybaby,Well - the acting was just okay. Not a single character really stood out as memorable. A lot of the scenes seemed forced or almost robotic in nature. The whole flow of the movie was not smooth - more like a jerky roller coaster.I am a fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal's - and that is why I gave it 2 stars. But this is far from good work. I would really like to have the 96 minutes of my life back I spent watching this.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance (and often nude body) is the only real reason to watch this mediocre film, and even she is unable to elevate the movie above the dozens of similar independent offerings out there: only make time for this one if you're a Gyllenhaalic."
4,Creating Bible Classes as Interesting as the Bible,"Blair's book places Bible teaching within a theological framework and treats both teacher and student with equal respect, reminding us the best learning experiences occur when healthy interaction is encouraged between teacher and students.Blair's ideas on how to make the study of the Bible meaningful and relevant are woven into a discussion of learning styles, models of Biblical interpretation, creating an effective learning environment, and building one's own Bible study (without using a published curriculum).Highly recommended for anyone with interest or responsibility in leading Bible studies, whether connected with a church or for private study."
2,some useful information,"The two stars are because it contains some useful information, though not enough to stop me skipping past some large chunks in the middle. The authors seem to think that a collection of anecdotes presented in sub-Tracy-Kidder journalistese and finished off with a ten point list, amount to analysis. I wonder if they have ever read a real book (as opposed to a business book) in their lives.On the other hand I suppose it is no worse than any other business book I've ever read."
4,a small masterpiece,"I buy a lot of music. Sometimes I buy a CD because I like one song and that's what it happened with this one. The first time I listened to it I thought that there must have been some kind of mistake. A CD like this should have made this people world famous. But it didn't. There are five pieces of art out of ten songs. I don't know if they will make another record, I hope they will, because this is one of the best CD's I have bumped to in many years.If you like Pulp, Suede, Blur you should get this one. If you don't like them or don't know them, well, you should start buying this one.Excellent music, smart lyrics, fresh style, and the best so far of four small genius."
2,Weak UV,"It arrived fine. I tested the batteries before I installed them. When I did I found a very low output of the flashlight. In short I didn't like it. If forced into a corner I would use it, but for the most part I would look around for a UV flashlight with a higher output. The ""switch"" is based on how far you screw down the back cap. Screw it a little and you use the momentary rubber button at the back. If you want the flashlight on for a longer time period you just screw down the back cap until it stops."
3,"Compact, solid, but a bit faint","It's hard to use this UV penlight unless the room is almost totally dark. That said, it is very solid (hey, it's a Streamlight) and seems to be well-made for the money. I bought it to check for pet urine stains, but it really doesn't do that very well. I think this was designed to check ID's and hand stamps at nightclubs and possible check currency as well."
3,great quality,"I purchased this item to facilitate my kit as an EMT.The product is very well made and durable.The only problem with it,is that is not bright enough.I replaced the batteries think that they did not have enough power left in them.This did not solve the brightness issue."
2,low lighting,"the light may be good for night use, but in my application the light was not bright enough"
3,INSTRUCTIONS NOT INCLUDED!!,"So I anxiously awaited the arrival of my rack and opened it to find no instructions. Does anyone know where I can find them online or something. I'm highly upset! It may be a great rack, but I'll never know without instruction on how to actually put it together and try it out."
4,Best of his solo albums,"Better than out of control, this is worth a spin. Destiny is a very good song that could have gotten radio play at the time if given the chance."
5,Handlebars,"Perfect, just what I needed to sit upright on my mountain bike. no more back pain....great. 5 and a half inches makes a"
3,NOT TOO BAD,"LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THESE BARS, EXCEPT THAT THE KNURLING ON THE BAR WHERE IT ATTACHES TO THE NECK IS ALMOST ALL SMOOTH. BEST BE READY TO CRANK DOWN ON THE SCREWS TO KEEP IT FROM MOVING BACK AND FORTH. THINKING ABOUT DRILLING A HOLE THROUGH THE NECK BRACKET AND BARS AND PUT A STAINLESS SELF TAPING SET SCREW IN TO HOLD THE POSITION."
5,Best pick me up in the world,S-Scape - the opening track from Sequencer - has been my get-up-and-go music for thirty years now. I think I still have the cassette I bought at Tower Records in Berkeley in 1978.
2,Transfixing,"I first heard music from this disk while returning to work in Michigan one dark night. The all-night service of WAUS played the Courante from the Partita number 6. I arrived at my destination and sat transfixed until the end, delighted with the syncopation and wittiness of this music. OK, it's not ""authentic"" but I rather think old Bach would be quite happy to see what this artist has done with his music."
2,Item received NOT item in photo - Expired date concealed,"Just like another reviewer I also did not receive the item in the photograph. I had contacted the seller asking him to ONLY send me a factory sealed package that has the date codes imprinted on the box. He said ""you will get the item exactly as pictured. I did not. I got what looked like 2 original HP cartridges. I got them in a WHITE LITTLE BOX. The box had no date codes on it. I did open one cartridge to see if it had a date code. It did and shows that the cartridge EXPIRED in September 2010. Just expired. The REAL colored original HP box would have had the expiration code on it. Thanks to the INCREDIBLY GREAT AMAZON customer service department, they will make this right for me. But until Amazon gets this situation fixed you might want to order from someone else."
3,Don't fit in my HP PSC 2355v all-in-one,They don't fit in my HP PSC 2355v all-in-one although there was nothing shown on the web said the compatibility. Guess it is a waste of money then.
4,To expensive but they work,Unsure why these cartridges are so darn expensive but they do work well. This is for my hp 7410 all-in-one.
4,Very satisfied,"I just wanted the proper cartridge for my model 7410 printer, and this product is fine."
2,If you like the getup kids....don't bother,"I made a special trip to go pick up the getup kids newest album on opening day. After my experience with the last two albums i couldn't wait to listen to the laid back tunes i have come to love. To make a long story short on my 15 minute drive home I took the album out of the CD player and put in ""On a Wire"". I have listened to this CD through several times hoping to unlock my appreciation for a song or two, but it just didn't happen. This album is 13 tracks of filler, the album lacks any kind of hook that makes you want to hum along, and it sounds like a toned down version of the getup kids. Maybe it's just me, but thats just not going to cut it."
3,"I agree, a good middle ground.","After the New Amsterdams record that came out as ""On A Wire,"" it is nice to hear the Get Up Kids come closer to their older stuff, although I find it rather odd that my favorite Guilt Show song isn't even on the album. It's ""Send Us A Saint,"" which is one of the six tracks that you get when you stick the Guilt Show cd in your computer."
5,Sleek and Beautiful,"Great toaster, looks great with my kitchen and the rest of my stainless appliances. Toasts well. Once in a while you may wonder where the toast or english muffin went :) the pop is so powerful that it shoots them out of the toaster. We have had the toaster for almost six months now and we have really enjoyed it, it is great for long slices of bread."
1,Haier TST120SS 2-Slice Long Slot Digital Toast,"do not buy:1. origional setting not brown toast, next setting burned it!2. sometimes toast not pop up all the way. 8 yr old grand daughter burned hand trying to get toast out!3 10 sec delay before start toasting is irritating when in hurry!poor design and quality control.stan"
1,"Please, do not buy this toaster!","We bought this toaster on the strength of reviews in this forum. Evidently, there is great variability in quality flowing from China. Our unit developed `quirks' almost immediately, and they never cured themselves. After 4 months of light use, the push-down-to-latch mechanism which starts the heater just wouldn't! No amount of cleaning, shaking, prayer or late night exhortation helped. It just died. Contact with the Haier Customer Service group via email was a dud. Never did get a response. I conclude there aren't any English speaking persons available to hear my plea. Oh, it did work OK for a short time, but, now its just trash."
1,God is not a Santa Claus,"Out of the 12 previous reviews, 10 of them speak of what the reader GOT instead of what they GAVE. The idea of approaching the Almighty with the hand out & the agenda outlined speaks for itself & also for the main thrust of this book's teachings. The book will indeed ""change your life"" but maybe not in the way you had planned. As my C.S. relatives used to say, ""Don't think for yourself. We'll tell you what to think."" Oh yes, all but one of them have died premature & needless deaths & that one eagerly agreed to medical care when the need came. Sorry but I've seen it all, read the book (& had it read to me) numerous times, heard the testimonies & seen the ""miraculous"" healings & I'm not impressed. The only possible ""positive"" (to some) would be it's a good way for the practitioner and/or ""teacher"" (after only a few WEEKS of training) to augment their income."
3,A very old favorite,This edition was hard fro me to understand - the way it is laid out - I think it should be better organized and have a better tab le of contents
2,The edge of disaster,"This is really not celtic music, and certainly does not measure up to their early work. When Karen Casey left Solas as the singer, you could kind of tell by The Hour Before Dawn, which lost much of their Irish influences and tended towards new age and schmarmy cheese-music, that Solas was headed downhill. This album, I think is even worse than Hour. They seem to have no energy in their performace, and the feeling I get from the album is rather apathetic. There are maybe 1 or 2 songs that are slightly redeemable, but most of the songs are to slow. If you are a fan of traditional celtic music, don't buy this. However, if you appreciate Americanized new age/vaguely irish music, then go for it. You have been warned."
1,"Pretentious, Yet Irritating","I used to love Solas, back when they were a Celtic band with some nifty jazz influences.Now they're a jazz/pop/fusion band with occasional Irish ornamentation. They've kept their sound, but rebalanced it completely, drowning out the melody line. Their current material is heavily over-produced; many of the cuts are hard to tell apart. (And almost all the instrumentals are in a minor key, which gets droningly dull after a short time.)Save your money for Altan, or another band that still has some Celtic music in its soul."
3,Good for the most part,"Getz was always good, and this is a nice collection of his mellower tunes. It's especially good if you're looking for Getz's early music. However, beware that the sound quality is somewhat uneven, especially toward the end of CD-2, and in particular ""Willow Weep for Me"" and ""Body and Soul."" These numbers were obviously taken from some pretty old records. The notes are excellent when it comes to telling Getz's story, but little help in terms of the selected music (dates, players, etc.). If you're looking for the mellow music by this great player, I recommendGetz for LoversorStan Getz's Finest Hour, both nicely priced and with better sound quality."
2,Disappointing: Not up to par with current behaviorist traine,"Unfortunately, Ms Wood doesn't offer much in-depth help, and she is not current on association/behavior trends in training. I specifically object to her recommending a collar pop for a fear-biter. I'm recycling my book to take it out of circulation, along with the Monks' and other old-fashioned books."
3,finally got it....,"Didn't quite understand the story line at first, but I finally caught on. It was more amusing than I had hope.But all in all it was a good film and a good addition to my martial arts collection."
4,Poolsport swimming hoop,"The teenagers are loving this hoop! The adults like it too, although the don't get much time to play (because of the teenagers). The only problems I have noticed is that the screws are already starting to rust."
2,MY CAPS LOCKS BUTTON ISN'T WORKING...,"WE SHOULD ALL HAVE A LOSING SEASON LIKE PAT CONROY. HE WON THE SPORTSMANSHIP TROPHY AND MVP TROPHY FOR HIS BASKETBALL SEASON. HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO GRADUATE SCHOOL AND SEVERAL OTHER AWARDS. HE'S HAD BOOKS MADE INTO MOVIES. WHY IS HE WHINING? HE HAD A TOUGH CHILDHOOD. TIME TO MOVE ON, PAT. YOUR BOOKS ARE FUN TO READ BUT WE GET THE THEME ALREADY! MAYBE YOUR DAD WANTED YOU TO FIGHT HIM BACK. MAYBE COACH THOMPSON WANTED YOUR TEAMMATES TO FIGHT HIM BACK. WHO KNOWS? WHO CARES? LET'S GO PLAY H-0-R-S-E..."
3,No one expects high literature from Conroy,"It is another journey back in time that Conroy takes us on with My Losing Season, the story of his senior basketball season at the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. The year is 1967, and Conroy's typically self-depreciating opening line tells it all: ""I was born to be a point guard, but not a very good one."" The book's success-his illuminating memories and energetic narration of that season's most exciting moments-is balanced by that most Conroyesque tendency to give in to melodramatic excess and self-absorption. Yet, for those who read Conroy, one might argue that is precisely the reason for reading the highly regarded Southern novelist in the first place. No one expects high literature from Conroy, but what they expect they get: a sympathetic, heart-wrenching portrait of a talented young man and the hard lessons he learns one season many years ago. And how that year left an indelible, emotional mark on the man Conroy was to become."
1,Stop the whining!!,"I have a message for Pat Conroy: STOP YOUR WHINING. I read the book on a recommendation from a friend - however, I wish had not wasted my time on it. Mr Conroy did a masterful job of weaving the story of his life into his expereinces at the Citadel. But, personally, I could not take his whining attitude - the tough plebe system at the Citadel, his ""Great Santini"" father, his demeaning basketball coach, the reaction from Citadel alumnists over his bashing of their school. This book seemed to infer that he was suffering some inhumane, life-long injustice. Give me a break!! I regret that Mr Conroy's reputation as a great writer and the publisher's willingness to support this project allowed the book to be published in the first place. For anyone paying attention to the rest of the world, this book is a crock...one word of advice for Pat Conroy: suck it up!! Alas, I think it's too late for Mr Conroy. One other note: You would never, ever see wrestler write a book like this!!"
5,One of the Best.,"I purchased the text in order to gain some insight into a subject I knew very little about. The book is extremely well organized and the topics are fully explained. There's a mix of history included with the technical explanations that makes this book very enjoyable reading. If your goal is to develop a clear understanding of the foundations of cryptography, look no further."
1,Glad I did not buy it,"It was the cryptography book at a course I am attending. I got the impression the authors just liked 'listening' to themselves.The instructor basically did not like the book either, but it was dictated by his higher ups.Sorry, but I would not pay for this book."
2,Why buy this version...,"When for just (lots and lots and lots) of pennies more, you can buy Myster Science Theater 3000, Volume 12, which includes an AWESOME riff on the very same movie?The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection, Vol. 12 (The Rebel Set / Secret Agent Super Dragon / The Starfighters / Parts: The Clonus Horror)It makes the movie watchable and re-watchable.BTW, Michael Bay's movie ""The Island"" was a total ripoff of ""Parts: The Clonus Horror,"" with some varying bits of other better sci-fi movies as well. Dreamworks eventually reached a 7-figure settlement with the creators of ""Parts."""
3,Not the real deal.,This was a remake of the original. This one was amateurish and did not have the impact of the original. I was disappointed.
3,Okay Product,"The product itself is made fine. I use this product as the Bostitch website said this is the correct size of nail for my siding nailer. I don't know if it's product or the nailer, but it seems to jam on a regular basis. I can get 10 jams then shoot 75 without problems."
1,JUNK,I wore these shoes for only a few weeks and the synthetic uppers beagan to tear!!! They are made of JUNK.
3,Okay,"Libana have beautiful voices, but this recording does not have the same sing-along quality as their 2 chants & rounds CDs. Best as background ambience."
1,"A lot of batteries, but little power","I appreciated the number of batteries, but even in the lowest drainage electronics, some didn't even last 30 minutes. There was no way of knowing how long they have been sitting before being purchased. By my guess, they rounded up all the expired batteries and sold them in large lots making it look like a good deal. Trust me, it wasn't! Don't buy these and save your money. No value at any price!"
2,in order to use this vaccum you need to be a weight lifter,"Product is extemely heavy - not good if you have to carry it upstairs. Carpet selector adjustment broke after just 4 weeks. Consumer Reports highly recommeded it, but I would not."
1,Love the series,I love the series. My wife and I watch them all the time. I can't wait for the new season to come out on disk. I got them at sears for $75 after shipping. Not a great price on Amazon. This is one of the few items I found a better deal elsewhere.
3,3 1/2 STARS WOULD BE THE FAIR CHOICE.,"OK,... i can manage the fact that theres is a pop feeling in the album, thats not a scary thing considering other pop albums.....and no; i'm not a dissapointed trip hop entusiast. But there's that feeling -this album lacks the originality and genius of the four or five stars bands- (lets be a little bit less permisives, in this cases, just hear ""High Life""). The tracks that i dig are (well, Not to deny) ""Life in mono"", and so ""Pengüin Freud"" and ""Slimcea girl"". In ""Hello Cleveland"" i hear the soundtrack for a clay short (it's ok i sometimes like something of them (:P) but believe me it's no surprise for me that this is the only album of this mono fellows.Lets keep the stars for the ones who deserve the honour , mmmmm...... examples? : among a bunch of others, Les Gammas (Compost records) I can just feel the full flavor of the music."
4,mood music for malcontents,"ambient noise grooves, electronic noodling and sixities mor pop melodies professionally mixed into miniture movie soundtracks. their strengths are their knack for melodic changes and the crushed velvet vocals of siobhan de mare. a consistent and skillful balance of mood, groove and lyrical hooks should propell this disc into the realm of heavy breathing classics."
3,"Fair Warning-- Two Bands Called ""Mono""","Not so much a review as a heads up... There is an (in my opinion) amazing post-rock band from Japan called Mono. This is not their music. This Mono is a Euro-house/ downtempo outfit. As the Japanese band is far more critically acclaimed, it is likely people may come here and see this album and think it is by ""the"" Mono. It isn't. If you want '90s cheese-pop with an electronic sound, this is the band far you. If you want the actual band Mono, keep searching."
3,Item was in perfect condition,"The item was in good condition, but it did take over a month to recieve."
2,Formica Music It Is!,"Mono adds a eurotrash element to their cliched chick vocaled electronica, there ain't nothing exciting here, go buy another Portishead album instead."
5,Eclectic,"Formica Blues was my first Mono purchase. The entire album was so pleasant to listen to again and again. I didn't feel I had to skip ANY tracks. While each song in the album seemed to have an underlying spooky sound, they each used unique warming innovations that were easy on the ears. Mono is comparable to Garbage's sound, but aimed at and crafted for slightly more mature listeners."
5,Better in real life than in the pictures.,Received product after a few days. When I got it I put it on my truck. It fits perfectly and works great. Thank you so much for the great prices and fast shipping. I will continue to buy from this seller.
4,Squiggly Worms,"This is a great product for some quick-play action. I always say to a student, ""How many worms can you pick up before you run out of time?"" This game helps to increase a child's processing speed and fine motor (eye/hand) coordination - needed for writing, typing, and music-playing skills. Plus, it's fun!"
2,Quick to Make,I was a little bit disappointed by this book. I only found a couple of things that I would make. The projects did not look hard. Many of these ideas and projects I have seen in other books. That being said I do have an extensive book collection so some one may find these projects new and exciting.
3,The story line is not original. Deja Vu all over again.,"A quarantined pleasure planet, a drug-induced ecstasy, and a planet controlled by a computer: Where have I seen these themes used before? Oh yes. ""Shore Leave,"" ""The Apple,"" ""The Return of the Archons,"" ""For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky (TOS)""; ""When the Bough Breaks"" (STTNG); and ""Once Upon a Planet"" (Animated series). I agree with the first review. Bypass this novel for better ones on the store shelves."
1,Boldly Going Where Everyone Has Gone Before,"Oh, no.It is hard to believe that such a big name as Theodore Sturgeon is partly responsible for this cliche-ridden soup. I don't think there was one single original idea in this book. Technology taking control over a planet? Why not rather make Captain Kirk rescue a planet whose inhabitants are going crazy because their internet connections have stopped working! Even that would be a change.The characters don't have any memorable personalities, and the Trek regulars could be replaced with anonymous paper dolls. A reader would not notice anything because he is already fast asleep.Don't waste your time with this joyless novel, not even if you otherwise have an obsession to possess all things Trek."
1,Great Movie Fair Copy,"This is a great movie and one of my favorites since my childhood. Robert Taylor and George Sanders at their finest. Elizabeth Taylor was never more beautiful. Wonderful supporting cast. A wonderful story. Downside is that this copy is less than pristine. King Solomon's Mines and Ivanhoe came out on the same day and I bought them both. King Solomon's Mines was a beautiful copy and would recommend you buying it if you are a film buff. Ivanhoe, on the other hand, is a good copy but not a great one. I am giving away the copy I bought here because it is only soso. Hopefully, MGM will issue this film at a later date made from a good print. The best I can give this copy is a B-. Its ok at best. Great film but only fair copy."
5,I wasn't sure at first...,"I wasn't sure at first whether I should buy Steve Poltz's Cd or not, but after buying a bootleg of Vh1's Unplugged with Jewel, I had to get it. Two of the songs on the bootleg included Steve and I fell in love with not only his sense of humor, but his style, voice and emotion. ""One Left Shoe"" is an awesome album and may be compared to Jewel or Sarah McLachlan's albums, but we must remember that everyone has there own style of performing and although, you may not like Sarah's or Jewel's it's impossible not to like Steve's. I give him two thumbs up and five stars!"
1,Returned for refund.,"So not worth the price. Well written, but the Kindle edition is a poorly scanned image with only rudimentary navigation. I returned it."
3,Good but...,"It certainly could've done without Vince McMahon's ego. ""Battle of the Billionaires"" with Donald Trump was downright predictable. Stone Cold of course has to make his big ""FU!"" entrance as a referee who predictably helps the victors. Even years after the cartoonish heyday of WWF in the '80s, McMahon still cannot resist a little of the influence. The entire storyline really could've been omitted.On the positive side, this DVD is worth it just to see Hardy jump fifteen feet down on top of Edge during the MITB Ladder Match. It didn't have the rhythm of some of the previous matches, but I think there's enough there to sustain interest. The remainder of the discs come down to the Benoit/MVP, Undertaker/Batista, and Cena/Michaels matches. They are all excellent or better, and like another review stated, they should've saved the Undertaker match for last. The last 10 minutes is classic edge-of-your-seat drama. If you can omit McMahon's appearance, Wrestlemania 23 is a decent buy."
4,good but not great,i like the toy rlly cool but the right foot wont fit in the hole and there is no pic of osama about to be shot its sudamn
5,Strong Magnet Clip,Great magnet clip. I bought 2 to hold a calendar on the refrigerator. With these clips I can also store the bills for the month with my calendar. Very strong. Love them
2,Disappointed.. not much good when the clip comes apart from the magnet!,"I got two of these; one is still functioning but the other - the clip came off the magnet part and i didn't even use it yet. I just bought these in the last week or so. Mostly bought because i needed to reach that $25 amount for Freee shipping. Anyway, a lil' disappointed."
3,"Good, Inaccurate Description","It's great, but I bought this one as opposed to a cheaper one which looked the same because it said it held more DVDs. It does not. Maybe it would hold 72 CDs. But it holds as many DVDs as the other, cheaper one would. The quality was good, and it's a nice piece. Just wished I'd bought from a cheaper seller with a more accurate description.I wanted to give it 4 stars, but it won't let me edit that."
3,Question,"Please forgive my ignorance, I am not saying the book is not good but I have read repeatedly, I've even read statements made by the author himself that this book was ""nominated"" for a Pulitzer yet when I went to the website of [...] where they have been listing winners as well as ""nominees"" for the Pulitzer since 1980 there is no mention of Jerry Ellis or his book in the list of nominees. I wrote [...] to ask why Jerry Ellis or this book was not listed as being nominated for a Pulitzer and they wrote back and said if he had been nominated for the Pulitzer then he would definitely be listed on the website. However, Jerry Ellis or his book is not listed as being ""nominated"" for a Pulitzer on [...]. Does anyone have an explanation for this? Did I misunderstand the statements made about the book being nominated for a Pulitzer?"
1,"Too much Jerry, not enough Cherokees","I was deeply disappointed by this book. Jerry Ellis takes himself and his so-called ""insights"" waaaay too seriously. It is hard to accept his ""link"" with his Cherokee ancestors when he had the luxury of clean beds, fresh food, and freedom of choice. It is an insult to their suffering for him to compare his journey with theirs. This book is a ""Blue Highways"" wannabe that doesn't make it."
2,Nothing Special,"This heavy duty vacuum is not as heavy duty as it appears. The handle on this vacuum looks like chrome plated plastic, but it may be metal, since I don't want to break it to see. It allows for good suction and the wheels appear sturdy. The biggest complaint we have with it is that it doesn't have any brushes on it. It picks up loose stuff but doesn't brush and loosen the dirt or anything else that may be hugging the pool sides and bottom. My last cheap manual vacuum from Lowes had brushes and did a much better job. Unfortunately, Lowes manual vacuums didn't have brushes on them the last time I checked."
2,"Well-written, repulsive","I almost stopped reading this book when one of the main characters went mad and began consuming his own excrement. If this doesn't put you off, perhaps you could overcome a natural revulsion and enjoy the author's excellent writing style. I couldn't. Be warned that this book does not end by giving the reader an uplifting feeling. The writing is powerful enough that you won't be able to forget it; personally, I sincerely regret that."
1,Wannabe,"Paul Auster is a pretentious failed scenarist who writes for Sight & Sound and whose movies are an embarrassment, it's clear he regards the novel as a minor art form judging by his ability to write one. Like Normon Mailer & Gore Vidal and the other totems of the ""litry"" establishment who lust after Hollywood recognition they only manage to leave a bad smell behind."
2,More Strange than thoughtful,Timbuktu is the first book I have read by Paul Auster. Other reviewers have read more of his work and have a good opinion of it. But based on this one book I doubt I will read any of the others. It is just too odd and makes you wonder what is the point. A man who has led a problematic life is about to die and he goes to Baltimore with his dog to find the high school teacher who encouraged him many years ago. He dies and the dog has some adventures. That is about it. The dog expresses himself and acts human-like. Maybe the point is that life is difficult and you have to watch out for yourself. At some 170 pages at least the book is short.
1,Poor Quality,"I was given this train and it failed to operate after meer minutes. Lionel replaced the controller, it still did not work, then the entire set. The second set arrived and out of the box did not work either. Lionel's QC is non-existant on this one and made in China rings through for poor quality indeed. I would not recommed this dissappointment to anyone."
1,For neurotic moms only...,"Frankly I'm surprised at the high ratings this book received. I was given this book by my mother a few months after having my first child - and having nothing to read for a week at a family retreat ended up reading (most of) it. I found most of these ""lessons"" more than a bit silly and maybe applicable for a self-absorbed and neurotic mother. If you are the type that needs to make a list to remember to have a heart-to-heart with your partner - this book is for you. Otherwise, if you have the slightest bit of common sense when it comes to yourself, your child and your life - you certainly don't need this book."
2,I disagree,"No wonder her boy is destined to be an only child. I get only an overwhelming vibe of resentment from this mom whose child cuts in on her writing time and whose friends are only competetive about their children. I pushed myself through it because the ideas are good, but her illustrations lack any positive experiences of her own. The most redeeming parts are those in the shaded boxes contributed by other moms. They include the loving and learning aspects experienced by all new moms which Ms. Glyck doesn't seem to be able to contribute herself."
1,I really tried to give it a chance,"hey. I tried I really did, but this album (...). I am a bit tired of Beyonce hoggin the limelight. Give the others a chance. The songs sound over done. Christmas songs are for us to sing along with at the top of our voice. DC naaah! Try again. Hey Kelly maybe you should ditch Beyonce :)."
1,Worst Christmas Songs I've Ever Heard,Unfortunately you can't go below 1 star. These songs are pure and simply nasty. I can't believe someone can ruin christmas carols this way. This is absolute garbage!
3,Not the worst but not the best either!,"OKay I am not a big fan of Christmas albums anyway. There are only so many ways to sing Silent Night and other classics. I think Mariah did excellent, and the snippets of Whitney and Kelly Price's cds were okay.But back to Destiny Child. The CD wasn't bad at all. Their Cd was more urban and reflected what they wanted to potray. Upbeat, funky Christmas songs instead of a standard somewhat boring reindition of them.I think Michelle sounds better here than on anything she has ever done with the group (see O Holy Night)! Fabulous!Now whats with DC having 12 songs but 2 songs are under two minutes?Regardless, I don't see what is with all the hate?Opera of the Bells is worth the price alone. Well maybe not but it is excellent!Favs: Opera of the Bells, 8 Days of Christmas, DC medley"
1,"Destiny's Child take the ""Christ"" out of ""Christmas.""","If these songs are what Christmas is really all about, then maybe the Grinch isn't such a bad guy after all. Man, oh, man: this disc is pretty bad. These women erase the essence of Christmas (the birth of Christ, brotherhood, peace, joy, etc) and in its place sing ditties about crass materialism. That's right, as far as DC is concerned, it's all about the bling-bling--even during the holiday season. More to the point, these songs aren't sung very well. Beyonce is no doubt a talented vocalist (as are Michelle and Kelly), but she oversings every track. This showoffy vocal style is a common affliction amongst divas today. Just take ONE note and run with it! If you're looking for a true r&b holiday album, then get the old discs from Luther and Stephanie Mills or even SWV. This disc is just another lump of coal in the stocking."
3,Disappointed. Very disappointed.,"I love Destiny's Child. With that said, let me give this album a little criticism. This cd is not a Christmas album to be taken very seriously. Some tracks (like the very fun ""8 Days of Christmas"") are meant to be listened to lightly. Other songs are supposed to be listened to with a serious ear.I was horrified to hear the line ""I am a poor girl too"" in the song ""Little Drummer Boy."" I feel like the DC trio totally missed the point of this classic holiday song. They also butcher several other holiday tunes. Even ""Carol of the Bells"" gets an unneeded makeover with ""Opera of the Bells.""All in all Destiny's Child simply tries too hard with this cd. The charm and ghetto-fabulousness of the Survivor album simply doesn't exist on this collection. The album almost fits into the ""so bad it's good"" music category, but doesn't even quite get there."
1,Absolutely hideous,"This album encompasses everything that is wrong with today's culture--with crass, disgusting materialism outshining everything else on this horrid Christmas album. And I am actually a fan of Destiny's Child (and Beyonce). From the lame album cover to the hideous, hideous remakes of ""Silent Night"" (complete with vocal histrionics--WHY??? the title of the song has the world ""silent"" in it-get a clue) and the monstrous remake of ""Little Drummer Boy"" to the overt materialism of ""8 Days of Christmas."" BAD BAD BAD. Beyonce prides herself on being a Christian, so...this is the kind of materialistic crap that would banish a soul to ETERNAL DAMNATION IN HELL. If you're looking for the spirit of Christmas...RUN! You won't find it here."
3,Hmmmm,"Generally, I'm a big fan of Destiny's Child. All three women have beautiful voices and styles, but this CD was a bit of a let-down. I don't agree that the group has zero talent, but this is an album strictly for fans. A feature by Beyonce's little sister Solange (Destiny's Child always was a family affair) is a highlight, as is 'Opera of the Bells', one of my favourite carols with its name strangely changed. Mysterious.Don't waste your money."
1,what NOT to record for a christmas album,"This album is jokes, I love destiny's child but this CD is downright cheesy and was made just to capitalize on their popularity at the time with the survivor album. I suggest getting mariah carey's merry christmas or jackson 5's christmas album instead."
1,This album just (...),This is the most awful Christmas CD i've ever heard! It's just terrible. They absolutly butcher almost every Christmas song and the originals aren't that great either. The song 8 days of Christmas is is catchy and cute but the words are so dumb it's unbelievable. This Cd is so bad.
2,"If you've seen one, you've seen them all","Hot girls, but most are shrouded with beads and/or dorky guys holding beers. The footage is extensive, but nothing mind blowing. It gets repitive. No chapter references. Some creepy dudes are in the video and the soundtrack consists of ""WHOOOOOOOOOOOAAOAAAOOOOOH"" for two hours straight.Spend your money on a tank of gas for your car."
4,cuisinart cfo-3ss electric fondue maker,The stainlesssteel fondue maker was everything I expected it to be. It heated very fast and evenly to make a very delicious cheese fondue.
5,Fondue maker,"Very happy with my fondue maker. Works great and looks nice. Little hard to wash, because I have not figured out how to put in dish washer, nor have I wanted to take a chance of ruining it. But I love this, it is a good choice if you are looking for a nice compact fondue maker."
4,Not so non stick,"Made cheese fondue exactly according to the recipe booklet. Taste was spot on but clean up was a challenge. You can't get too rough with a non stick surface or it will ruin it. So, after soaking over night it was still a challenge to clean. Otherwise, I like it and I will continue to experiment with other recipes."
4,Sambora Quietly Tells Some Stories,"There is no arena bombast to be found on Richie Sambora's 'Undiscovered Soul.' Even the upbeat songs are practically acoustic jaunts that thrive on creative vigor more than amplified exuberance. It's easy to get the impression that Richie Sambora's just a really nice guy, this album shows a songwriter who really doesn't have a lot of problems and who's content to share with us his content and his committment to his world. It's a gentle record, something you can play in the background instead of blasting down the street.The standout tunes are 'Hard Times Come Easy' an upbeat rocker and 'All That Really Matters' an unabashed dedication from Sambora to his wife.Lots of artists claim to be writing albums for themselves first, with 'Undiscovered Soul,' I can believe Richie Sambora wrote an album for himself, that we, the listeners, can't help but enjoy. It's just a really nice record."
5,"A fun movie, with a hot cast. Very entertaining!!","This movie is predictable but the cast does a great job of selling the movie. I did laugh outloud a few times and was never bored. Actually, I thought it was a good enough for a repeat of viewing. The best part of the movie is Hayden."
5,Now here if you like Hayden Panettiere,Surprsingly well written coming of age movie. Script and acting not bad at all. Not bad script as a unpopular guy gets the Hottest Girl thats very popular. High School at at Its best. Only buy if you like this type of movie but acting is great the script moves and this better one of thse movies need to watch.
2,are you kidding me?,"Dream Theatre they are not... not even close. The only great song is 7 tracks in and the rest is very mediocre. The writing is ammaturish, the vocals are laid down with a beat syncronous to the rythm of the melody pathetic. It goes on and on with the lilt of kids nursery rhyme... da na, da na, da na, da nananana da na. And what's up with the gutteral groans scattered carelessy through out. I like in your face metal as much as melodic rock, but throwing down growls in an AOR tune is too weird.Save your money"
2,The Book That Never Ends,"I am a bit disappointed in the author after reading this book. I think he was trying to build on the success that he had with Pillars of the Earth but this book falls far short of that classic. This book is more like a [$] mass-market teen-age Romance novel. There is nothing new hear except maybe the name, the plot is so predictable it is sad coming from such a good author. I knew how this book was going to end before it even started. He has written much better books, I would stay away from this book unless you are looking for a long love story."
3,Middle of the Road Follett,"I have read several of Follett's works and generally cannot get enough of them. This one is historical in nature yet the story is not as compelling as some of Follett's other works (Pillars of the Earth, A Dangerous Fortune). Some of the plot is predictible. However, it does have some likable characters and the book seems to be well paced. All in all it is better than most books but not quite up to Follett's usual high standard."
5,"Review of ""A Place called freedom""","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. And although fiction, it speaks volumes of how people were treated in those days and how some were successful with their dreams. Very good research I believe."
1,worst,"his worst book.. too,too many characters. after 150 pages, i still did not know who was who, i wont finish it!!! his only bad book."
3,Different,"I would have liked to give this book three and a half stars, but that option was not available.A Place Calles Freedom follows the converging lives of Mack McAsh, a Scottish coal worker who seems to always irritate the wrong people, and Lizze Hallim, a igh born lady who would prefer to act like a man.It is a tried and true fomula, and I enjoyed this book immensely, despite its predicatable plot. I particularly liked the introduction to the book, and the way that the story was introduced. I mainly gave this book three stars because it is very different from the other Ken Follett books that I have read. I've read Pillars of the Earth, a sweeping intricate novel, and Night Over Water, which I thought had an interesting an enjoyable plot.I knew how this book was going to end before it even started. The characters are fairly stereotypical. There are scenes that are reminiscent of a steamy romance novel. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but it's nothing to write home about."
2,"not nearly as good as Pillars, Eye or Dangerous Fortune","Thin plot, thinly developed characters, not the author's best. The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best. A Place Called Freedom is interesting, but not nearly the suspense, drama or richly developed characters of Follett's best... not worth a read in my opinion."
5,Place Called Freedom,"If you like Ken Follett's style, and you love historical romance--this book is for you! I have read many of Follett's works, and I believe this is one of the best! I hated to see it end!The characters are wonderful! The book has suspense, adventure, and a great deal of drama!"
3,This IS NOT Pillars of the Earth,"This book is more like a mass market Romance novel--written by a man! It was rather hard to believe that the same person who wrote the lengthy and intricate Pillars of the Earth, wrote this nice piece of fluff. It's not a bad book. But it is predicatable and for the voracious reader it does not cover any new ground. I am just glad that it was such a quick read. I wouldn't have wanted to spend a lot of time on this book."
5,This is Rod Stewart's signature album.,This is the best Rod Stewart album ever. Every track on it is superb. This was the creative peak of Stewart's music. Every other solo album he did after this one was really terrible. This whole album sums up what Rod Stewart is really all about.
5,A GREAT SWORDFIGHTING ADVENTURE,"Director Sammo Hung shows his Peking Opera School chops here with this terrific film. It has some of the best, if not the best, swordplay choreography ever filmed. The great stunt work of the famed Hong Kong ""Red Trousers"" adds even more to this movie. The story revolves around a simple fisherman and his reluctant involvement with two brothers and their struggle for power. Well written and fast paced throughout this film is a winner all the way. The standout cinematography by Arthur Wong is stunning. Lighting, color, tone, it is all good and was one of the great surprises of this film. In sum, it is beautifully photographed. Andy Lau's performance is top notch as is the work by Maggie Cheung and indeed the entire cast. The film even has a killer whale that carries some very nice scenes. If you love Asian films, or don't, this film is for you."
5,LOVE IT! Makes children use their imagination again!,"There's no batteries, no electronic gadgets...just high quality wood that encourages kids to use their imagination again...what a concept! My daughter plays for hours with her horses and barbies in this stable. I love to watch her do the ""chores"" on the ranch. Simple play. Perfect gift for any child."
2,Toy Was Received Broken!,"I just received this toy and it was broken. The stall doors are attached by a red elastic string so that the doors swing shut. However, they were broken and the doors fell off. The stall doors are not easy to get to and there are splinters in the wood. Then a week later, Amazon was offering it for $10.00 cheaper than what I paid for. I usually have a great experience with other sellers but not in this case. Plus, I have to pay the fee to ship it back to them and hope they reimburse me like they said they would. Agh!"
4,Best Price on a Great Barn,"This barn is great! A 2 lofts, ladder, 2 stalls (both with split doors. It is awesome. Fits the Only Hearts Horses perfectly and is a fraction of the cost. Mine came with a little glue drips across the front, but nothing a sand paper couldn't sand off. Great Buy!"
5,Groundbreaking Study,"This book set the agenda for research in Gilded Age/Progressive Era studies for the current generation of American historians. It is a groundbreaking study which is not overly long and is very well written. It is one of the most widely used overview texts for the period in graduate history courses. If you only want to read one book on this period, make it this one."
4,Interesting look at the growth of a giant,"Historian Robert Wiebe examines the USA as it emerged from mostly rural society to an industrial giant during the years 1876-1920. The author shows that the USA grew from a series of largely independent, mostly Protestant, small-town communities at the end of Reconstruction, to a more interlocked, diverse, and urbanized society by the end of the First World War. As the USA grew into the world's foremost power, diffuse forces arose to both lead and to give the changing society a sense of order. Those forces included industrialization, professionalism, scientific management, progressive reform, bureaucracy, and urbanization. In short, most elements of modern society. Not that this melding process was perfect - much division, racism, and inequality remained - but the melding process was a powerful and successful one.We studied this book in a college history class and it was one of the best we read; not as stiffly written as some histories and very informative."
2,This product is DEMOSTRATION TESTER,"This product has the same scent as the original, but it's a demonstration tester. For the price it's acceptable, but nowhere in the description is this fact mentioned. Also, this company charged the fed-ex rate for shipping and it took over three days to arrive."
5,Great for gunstocks,"After sanding and taking off the finish, I used this color to re finish my gun stock after dying it with a wine colored RIT and it came out fantastic!"
5,Essential electronic release,"Synergy is actually one man : Larry Fast, well known of Pete Gab's fans. Larry is a true genius in his realm, and his talent deserves to be recognized. ERfRO is his first effort and also his best. This record features five magic tracks, constructed on the same pattern as symphonic pieces, hence the name of the album. There are no drum machines, just various synths creating an ambient music à la Tangerine Dream or Robert Fripp (see my review of Robert's Blessing of tears). All in all, this is a fabulous record, one of the best of its category (i.e. electronic and ambient music), but unfortunately Synergy's following records don't have the same quality. Nonetheless, I recommend it to all synth lovers."
2,Interesting Reading,"To be honest I have not finished the pamphlet yet. I agree with some of the other reviews that it is very technical reading. But it gives the information on how what you put into your body effects your body which I found interesting.The back of the book is supposed to be about diet which I look forward to reading.I have read in other reading material that foods that restrict blood flow worsen the tinnitus they are salt, sugar, caffeine, chocolate, wine, and foods with MSG. So I look forward to reading the info in this pamphlet."
1,Won't fit,"It says it will fit a door up to 2"" thick, but it only goes up to 1-3/8"" just like every other knob."
3,Typos galore; At times too preachy,"Numerous typos obviously not the author's fault (Even the title is screwed up from the getgo--note that the main page and sidebar titles don't match), but the author must claim the preachiness of some of the fictional characters...nearly 3/5 of the way into the novel there are portions of dialogue that run on and on and on, without needful paragraph breaks. This really wearied this reader!Overall subject and characterization quite good."
4,A unique piece of art,"If I were to rate this purely on the basis of how much I enjoyed it, I would probably give it three stars, but then I would be doing it an injustice.First of all, the art is excellent, although not all the gags are funny, but this may be because (a) I'm pretty much as jaded a reader as you can get these days (b) I don't particularly like rhymes these days (c) although I'm pretty knowledgeable about classic comic strips, there is probably lots of things I just don't ""get"".Clearly Langridge worked really hard on this book. It is not a collection of monthly issues where the writer/artist is on a deadline and does his best. Clearly a lot of thought went into this book."
3,decent for the price,This microwave looks pretty good and functions as you would expect it to. For the price this is a good microwave. It doesn't bother me but others that have used don't like the fact that you can't get less than 30 seconds heat time. Seems to heat pretty evenly.
2,Spion Military Zoom Binoculars,"The quality of the binoculars is fine, and as long as only one eye at a time is used, it is OK, but when two eyes are used, there are two images, they do not overlay each other, just enough off that it is practically unuseable. As a monocular, it is OK.Binoculars are to heavy to hold, must use a tripod to keep it steady."
4,"Not a definitive collection, but a good introduction","For those unfamiliar with the (Chad) Mitchell Trio, this is a good introduction to the group. Highlights from their first three albums for Mercury are classic; though the last three, with John Denver, still have class. Two ""pop"" singles, never before released, should be of high interest to fans of CMT. After listening, you wonder why Mercury/Polygram doesn't just release all the albums in their entirety, as Kapp records is doing."
5,Modern French classic: wistful yearning/seductive sound,"Joe Dassin died tragically almost two decades ago but his music still defines the modern French male. Dassin's poignant, romantic sound will evoke bitter-sweet memories among those who have loved deeply, and wistful yearnings in those who hope to. Destined to become a classic in any sophisticated collection of CDs."
5,Beautiful!,"I am not sure for the negative reviewer! You buy this product because it complements the set... it is beautiful. As other previously stated... it is delicately beautiful, but surprisingly heavy. Doesn't make sense but it must be true because we are all saying the same."
4,Electro Distortion,"Brilliant work. Anything you can get your hands on by this artist (Jon Saul Kane) is fantastic. I still like his work under the name of Depth Charge a little better (which has some awesome samples from B-movies mixed all throughout), but there is something about the way he does squelchy electro feedback where it makes you feel you're at ground zero in a computer warzone. The artist's name is Jon Saul Kane, it is not (I repeat...NOT) Richard D James (aka Aphex Twin, Caustic Window, Polygon Window, etc.)."
2,Ick,"A leaden parable about the dangers of television and the whims of popular will. It's a grim bit of work, unleavened by creativity, with a fair bit of sadism. The doctor isn't particularly clever here -- a quicker witted man might have untangled his situation, a stronger willed one might have bowled through his obstacles. This doctor only stalls matters until the story is wrapped up by deus ex machina. An all around poor effort."
3,Slave resistance in the United States.,"There is a certain amount of revisionist history floating around that the slave/master relationship was one of benefits to both slave and master. Katz puts this to bed by saying resistance was fairly common and the master/slave relationship was one of exploiter/exploited. Not only did slaves take over ships (Amistad), but they escaped to the North and Canada, started slave rebellions, and resisted in the plantation, factories, and homes of the slave holders. Slaves also destroyed the plantation economy of Santo Domingo and hung their slave masters.Katz relays in this thin book about how slavery debased humanity for both the black and white population. This is a good short book about why slavery needed to end and answers the charges of the revisionist historians."
2,Maybe for boys?,"I wouldn't call this book especially well-written. Writing could be more exciting and colorful. Also, it's mostly white man heroes with tokens thrown in. Such is history."
4,All Substance,"A very interesting portrayal of the beginning of the end of apartheid in South Africa, this movie has plenty of substance. It's a story of intrigue and behind-the-scenes political maneuvering by the involved parties, with elements of suspense as the players operate amongst hostilities, dealing with threats of violence. This one should definitely be viewed by anyone interested in a broader and deeper perspective of one of the greatest events of modern global history.One exception which caused me to rate it only four stars: I didn't like the casting of William Hurt in the role of Professor Esterhuyzen, the primary mediator/negotiator between the government and the African National Congress. For me the role just seems miscast, but it's really a minor point and ultimately does not detract from the movie's overall message and importance."
1,Completly Different,"The T-Shirt in the picture is nothing like the one you get. The one they send you is deep black, and the colors on the target go: red, white, and blue. Not: blue, white, and red, like the picture shows. Very dissapointing considering how hard it is to find a T-Shirt for Led Zeppelin or The Who or any other band, that isn't black."
1,HORRIBLE,The backrest puts you in a horrible postition and cannot be asjusted bcause it is of the same bladder as the rest of the tube. The tube is flat instead of round making it low to the water. The backrest pushes you to the front of the tube making your legs hang way over. It sits so low in the water that the cup holders flood making them useless unless you like to drink river water. Water also floods the tops of the coolers leting water seep through the zippers melting your ice and making unuseable for drinks. Great concept...pathetic design!!!
1,Don't order it.,"There was a hole in the box when it was damaged during shipping. This caused a dent in the lamp part. I could handle that. But i couldn't handle the lamp being so heavy that the arm couldn't hold the weight. You couldn't adjust it so it would stay upright. No matter how much I tightened the knob on the arm of the lamp. I had to give up, pack it back up and return. Scared to order another at this point."
1,Agreed!,"Trust me even though I am an idiot who bought the book without glancing at the reviews or rating. This book is counter productive! The assessment that about 1 in 10 of the questions is fundamentally wrong is probably about the real rate, if not an understatement. I spent hours a day for a week drudging through the errors in this book only to find out the items that happened not to be flat out wrong don't really look much like the real LSAT anyway.And sure there is an errata sheet online but that doesn't help at all with the tests the poorly navigable CD includes.On top of that, the claims of free online help from LSAT coaches could be considered out right fraud and I wish the publisher was held accountable for these things.We are not over exaggerating. THIS BOOK SUCKS.Never again will I trust something just because it has a name I recognize (In this case McGraw Hill)."
3,This book is great for people just starting WoD,This book was did its job in telling the history of the World of darkness. Yet it seemed to me that most of this material was just a recap and mild expasion of what had aready been said in the othe WoD books. Look if you are new at WoD then you may get more kicks out of this book then I did.
5,Loved Every Song,"I recently heard a song off this record and it stuck with me ... So I purchased the CD (used through Amazon)... and discovered quite a treat when it was delivered. It came with no scratches and I found the artist signature on the front cover ... I Googled and confirmed it. I am so thankful I had the pleasure of seeing Mose Allison a number of years back one afternoon in Balboa Island, CA ... brought back memories of a grand afternoon. Gold. . ."
5,Comfort & quality in a mummy-style air mattress,"I used this air mattress during a 5 day sea kayaking trip thru the San Juan Islands in the Puget Sound. I have had less than stellar luck with ""quality"" air mattresses in the past, so I tried out the mattress before the trip. It performed flawlessly, and allowed an old geezer to get a good night's sleep. The comfort level of the 2.5"" thick mattress is way better than 1"" thick pads. It rolls up to a very small size, which makes it perfect for kayaking/back packing. Well worth the money."
4,CBs Celebrated In Pictures.,"Forget the current controversy surrounding CBGBs, this book isn't about that. This book uses pictures to describe the life and times of this Bowery landmark from it's early days in 1973 to the present. The first picture (not counting the inside cover shot of their famous toilets) is of The Ramones, and the last shot is of Handsome Dick of The Dictators. In between lies b&w photo after b&w photo of punk and New Wave in its infancy. If you were there this book will remind you of how it was. If you weren't this book will graphically tell you the story of NYC area kids tired of corporate rock who just wanted to play a few chords as loud as they could so they could feel the rush."
2,jar opening feature is useless,"I had a gizmo that popped the vacuum seal on jars in 2 secs, but it wore out from overuse, so I thought this one would be a great replacement...wrong!! although the can opener feature is nice and easy to use, I still cannot open a vacuum sealed jar without using all my might. This opener has NO EFFECT on easing the process. If that's your main issue, dont bother with this tool..."
1,Distorted Recollection,"This album was purchased in a fit of nostalgia, as I recalled Dusty Springfield as having a sultry and singular voice. What a disappointment to listen to a string of overproduced ditties. The production techniques effectively masked whatever talent this voice once displayed. Or was it just my wistful imagination all along?"
5,Easy To Install,I received the High Arch Faucet yesterday and installed it myself. The most difficult part of the process was removing the old faucet. I used the three hole installation with a fourth hole for the side sprayer. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The hot and cold water are attached via flexible connection or a hard connection. It is your choice. The sprayer is attached via a snap connection which was very easy to attach. It took me less than an hour to install. As I said removing the old faucet was the difficult part. I have only been using it for one day but it I'm sure it will last a lifetime. It also looks nice.
2,"Haydn, The Seasons; Bohm, Janovitz, Schreier; 1998","Listeners will enjoy the orchestra and solo sections, however, this is primarily a choral piece and as such this particular recording is most disappointing. Although the verbal articulation is excellent, the singing lacks the precision that Haydn's style demands, on several levels. The ensemble singing is ""wavery"" and rythmically messy throughout, with different choral sections entering either slightly ahead of ""the beat"" at many points, and slightly behind at others. One had the impression that either they were singing with their eyes on the notes rather than on the conductor, or that they had had too few rehearsals with the orchestra and soloists. The sopranos, particularly, sounded as if they were struggling to keep up with the pace. A logistical problem for choral singers using this CD for practice and home rehearsal, is that the numbers tabulated for the recording do not match those for all published scores."
5,Favorite Songs,"This is an awesome album! It has my favorite song by The Backstreet Boys on it, ""I'll Never Break Your Heart"" which was track 8 and the 7th single from from their 1st album ""Backstreet Boys""."
3,THE WEAKEST OF THE SERIES,"To me,this is the poorest of the popular Now series. Most of the songs are weak(especially the repulsive sun-screen track.) There are a few ones worth buying if for though such as ""Baby One More Time,"" ""I'll Never Break Your Heart,"" ""Because of You,"" and ""Hard Knock Life."" I veer towards the others. Especially Now 4!"
5,Look Who's Talking Now,love this movie. Whats not to like. It's the new popular christmas movie. John and Kirstie are fabulous in this one. Better than in the first two.
4,babies talking...,"i absolutely love these movies and where they took you. i remember watching these movies as nolstagia sake.... i am catch into that phrase recapturing the feel of the first time i partaken movies that are old, but new in the spirit of what i felt they were as i watched them growing up and loving the involvement of my imagination of what are babies actually thinking"
1,A terrible book,"Seeing is believing. I could not imagine some computer experts could write so ""well"" organized practice problems. If you want to put yourself in a nightmare before taking the test, just do a test from this book."
1,Worst book on Computer Science or GRE ever,"I am a computer science student at MIT. I read portions of this book before I had to burn it. With so much wrong information, this book is not only useless, but also harmful."
1,Avoid this book like the plague,"This book is absolutely horrible. Like the other 11 reviewers have noted, this book is loaded with typos and contains information that's just plain wrong. Save yourself the cash and the potential nightmare associated with the purchasing of this book by spending your time and money on something else."
2,Not much of a connection,"It's not the vocals, or the lack of melody that mothered me. It was lack of connection."
1,the trailer was pure propaganda...,"After I watched the trailer online... I HAD to see this movie. The black and white film... the gorgeous Guinivere Turner... I was shocked. Having trouble staying awake, while wanting to at least watch to movie all the way through... it's as if you're watching a first rehearsal of a play. Platonic lines and over-rated characters. I only liked the bizarre, eclectic bits and pieces between the scenes... really, it sucked."
1,An awful movie,"I wouldn't care who this movie was about, it was just dreadful. The entire point was to get two unlikely-to-hitch-up lesbians together. However, you wouldn't have known it through most of the movie. Four lesbian friends met throughout the movie keeping tabs on this relationship they were trying to foster. Gay or straight (or anyone else) don't waste your time on this vapid movie!"
2,Questioning,I opened this book with anticipation that I would be presented with an insightful examination of how the greats of the venture capital world worked with thier investments. What I found was a one-sided exploration about why these folks were great but not any of the grit that they must have faced to become the success that they are.
2,Not Impressed,"Where are the great stories that are promised? I read the whole book and am still scratching my head! Most of the stories surround how the VC's got started in the business, what it was like being a VC in the 60's & 70's, how much money investors made on different investments, etc...not why deals were funded. I was hoping to get a better sense of what decision making criteria were used to justify various investments and left severely disappointed.Where is the industry going? Again, no real insights here...As someone stated earlier, if I wanted a historical perspective on the VC industry or a who's who in the industry, there are many, many sources on the internet for this information.Try Ruth Ann Quindlan's book for better insights into the decision making that goes into dealmaking."
2,it worked ok,"It worked okay, but the Fenugreek seed pills have worked MUCH better for me. I read all the reviews before purchasing and it seems to work different for everyone. Just get the small size to try it before you commit to anything."
1,"Book is fiction, I know","The book is fiction. Not true at all. But, heh, if you like fiction, fine. I worked with the scumbags when they were trying to make the movie. I knew the first day when I worked with Sonny Gibson, that he was a con artist. But, I got paid, until the last invoice, which was never paid.The L.A. Times did a story on him, and all they could find was a fight in a bar, and a few other lower crimes. He never spent those days in the jail hole with rats."
2,Poor source of information for my purpose,This is a reprint of an old book that records indigenous people's basketry. The print quality and the book itself is pretty poor quality.
5,This is the song my girlfriend always wanted for her wedding,"I met my girlfriend online and she wants this song at our wedding, but I cannot find the Terri Clark and Sammy Kershaw version, if anyone wants to sell theirs or know of where to find it, please email me at Osiris2323@aol.com. Thanks, Shawn"
5,BEST BOOK I READ SO FAR,"I first read this book when i was in Junior High school in the 7th grade. I hated books, but one time i had to do a report in order to pass my class. The teacher gave us a few books and we had to pick one of them. I picked Just A Summer Romance because it looked intresting. I started to read the book, and from the first page i read i liked it. I liked it because it reflected my live. I loved that book so much that i read it in three days, i always read the book during math, spanish, social studies and english class, i use to wake up at three in the morning to read the book because i was wondering what would happen next. Now i'm a senior in High School and i still haven't forgotten about that love story."
4,So Funny!,Mike Myers is a riot -- especially in the role of the Scottish father. Amanda Plummer is at her creepiest. And Mike Myers' poetry readings are classic. I highly recommend this video -- particularly for anyone of Scottish origin!
5,"Great comedy for the non-comey types. Not obnoxious - but rather, subtle, clever humor.","Comedy is typically not my first choice. This movie was recommended by a friend, and since I received it, I've watched it over and over again. I don't care much for obnoxious humor (Jim Carey type). Mike Myers is hilarious in his talent at inserting subtle, clever humor. This movie is a keeper. I guarantee you'll watch it over and over again!"
4,Woman. Wooooman!,Cheesy fun! It was a harmless romp that helped wile away an hour or so. Mike Meyers was hilarious in this movie.
5,Excellent--encouraging and well-illustrated,"My two-and-a-half-year-old son loves this book! The text is refreshing--simple, yet joyful and instructional--a rare feat. The paintings of Teddy Bear's first day at preschool are colorful but not cartoonish, detailed but not pretentious. I highly recommend this book."
2,"A decent soundtrack, but should have had ABBA","For the most part, I have no quibbles with this soundtrack. The reason I give it 2 stars is that it contains Sixpence None The Richer's version of ""Dancing Queen"" instead of ABBA's. Sixpence None The Richer's version is fine, but not particularly inspired. It's a carbon copy of the original. What's the point? If they had done something innovative to the arrangement it might have been interesting, but as it is soundtrack buyers are missing one of the greatest songs to come out of the disco era done as it should be...by Swedes in white suits"
1,An insulting mix of bad music,"This is a terrible selection of music from the 1970s. These are the worst of the worst;soul-less teeny-bopper tunes, lined up like an Easter Bunny parade. Once again the 1970s are sanitized; purged of protests, anger, race, gender, or economics. For the Culture Trust, all that remains of the 1970s is Cheeze-Whiz and bell bottoms, and not one ounce of reality."
5,Well Done,"Candid, insightful, gentle, humorous...these are some of the words that appear for me as I consider this video.I highly recommend this to anyone whose life has been touched in some way by this man.That just might be everyone - considering how prolific he is! :)"
4,entertaining,interesting and entertaining film about Dr Chopra showing the extraordinary man on a day-to-day living. I wished i saw more verbal and physical affection from Dr Chopra towards his son {was that too personal? :D }
4,What a surprise!,"What a surprise this video was! At first, it made me uncomfortable - I have always held Deepak in such high regard, I kinda forgot he was as human as the rest of us! This movie brings home the fact that, at the end of the day, Deepak Chopra deals with everyday issues just like you and me. His son was very brave to put this kind of movie out. I applaud them both."
5,Wonderful,Deepak Chopra is an oustanding author and an inspration. His laws are profound and impactfull. Read his stuff and you will be amazed.
4,"Great, warm sleeping bag","My husband and I bought this sleeping bag to use on a camping trip to Yellowstone. I was worried about being cold because I always am when we go camping. It was in the 30's at night but I slept great. Very comfortable. It is a little bigger than what we need, but otherwise great."
5,Mammoth 0-Degree Sleeping Bag. Awesome!,"I ordered this bag on 9/29/10 and it has already been delivered! Exactly what I was looking for. The quality seems great. Nicely lined with flannel. It is as wide as a queen size bed and will hold the hubby, son, and myself perfectly. I can't wait to use it this weekend. No doubt it will keep us warm!"
4,Nice Bag - gonna 'test' this weekend,"Received the bag on time - gonna try it in the colorado mountains (around 10K feet) this weekend (Memorial day 2009). Weather is to be cooler (about 30 deg F in the mornings) so we'll see how it works. It has plenty of space, very soft inside, feels warm in the ""inside house"" test. It completely filled the stuff sack it came in - so my only concern is how to get it back in there! I'll find out this evening... It is large even in the stuff sack, yet expectedly so as to it's intended size... First impressions - very nice! I gave it 4 stars as I haven't used it yet...."
4,Touching,"What a story. That this is a first novel is impressive, but shame about so many typos. Anyway, I was drawn into the story and found her observations and style to be engaging. It was a bit depressing, sure, but...isn't that the way life really is? No happy endings, death, loss, regret. Makes you want to mend fences and repair burnt bridges."
1,DMX-Straight NEEDS Jesus!,DMX is a talented rapper no-doubt! but the man needs to use his God-given skills for the Lord and quit playing with fire!
