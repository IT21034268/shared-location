5,Long lost Christmas Movie,What a great find this was for me. For years I have been watching for this to come on TV again but it has never happened. I remembered as a great Christmas about a boy and his grandfather. It was as great as I remembered it. It arrived quickly and as soon as I found a video player (not on dvd) I viewed it. Thank you so much
5,Feel good Christmas movie,"I have to admit to not being a big Mickey Rooney fan but I used to watch this when it first came out years ago and enjoying it so when I saw it for sale I decided to order it since they never play it anymore. We watched it the night it came in and while the VHS is not the best picture the film was fun to watch and just as good as I remembered it. The plot is pure fantasy but it is a Christmas movie so what else could it be. Mickey is the grandfather to the kid and has promised to take him to New York to see what a real Christmas is like, I said it was a fantasy right. Mick dies before the trip but is sent back to earth from heaven to find the spirit of Christmas who is missing in NYC. It plays out well and there are some good supporting players to help with the story. Interesting side note for me is the child who plays the grandson is Scott Grimes who is a pretty good singer/actor today and gave such a great performance in Band of Brothers as Malarky."
1,slinky crystal radio,Winding the tuning coil was critical and ridiculously hard to do. Assembly of the cheap parts (toilet paper roll) and single plastic folding form was tough to get to stay fixed once assembled. Never got the radio to work although it did pick up some static.
1,Please don't buy it.,"This kit is so incredibly cheap. For 75 cents more of raw material, it could be so much easier to put together. I spent a couple of hours struggling with this with my 9 year old daughter and never got any signal at all. The wires were flimsy, the screws were incredibly small and the whole base was flimsy. Spend a couple more dollars any buy a better kit."
2,hard for a kid to build,Very difficult for a young child to make. Even older kids will have trouble with the very fine and delicate wires.
3,Old school stove tops.,"For those of you out there with the old school coiled stove tops, be careful of the paint on the bottom of the pan coming off onto the stove. I am assuming it works fine with the newer stoves that are out there that just have a flat surface that becomes heated."
3,somewhat boring,"I thought this would do more, kinda boring, good for the age group recommended on the toy. I bought it for my 2 1/2 year old because she likes uniqua, but she isn't that interested in it. Didn't realize the age recommendation until after she had opened it. Oh well."
5,"Great Characters, romance, revenge....this book has it all!","Just couldn't put it down. Each chapter (conveniently easy to read one per 15 min. coffee break) focuses on a different character's story and they are all get woven together in a facinating way.I had to wonder who they all represent in real life....who is Camilla Clapfish? Who is Judith Gross?I will say, the ending tied everything up a little too quickly and neatly, -- but hey, this isn't supposed to be Toni Morrison and I didn't want it to be....."
1,Get a different tape instead,"Despite what may be claimed on the cover, this tape does not have a real warm up/stretch section. Her definition of a warm-up is some squats. You then spend a lot of time on all fours without being prompted to sit back into ""child's pose"" to take care of your shoulders and back. If you are into the compulsive masochistic type of workout, you may get into this tape. I'll be doing my other workouts instead of this one.(By the way, it is about 15 minutes.)"
2,Forgettable Reggaeton,"Nothing special here. The cover photo has serious merit, but you can do much better for Reggaeton. Save your money."
4,A good script!,"""Decision Before Dawn"" was written by Peter Viertel, once himself a member of the O.S.S.It's a good script, full of weird characters, played by German actors like Hans-Christian Blech, Hildegard Neff and the famous O.E. Hasse. If you look close enough, you can even spot a very young Klaus Kinski!The performance given by young Austrian master-actor Oscar Werner is simply superb.If you like a gripping (anti-) war-movie, you'll be delighted with ""Decision Before Dawn"".Watch out for a TV-documentary on the screenwriter Peter Viertel: ""PETER VIERTEL: BETWEEN THE LINES"". It will be shown in the fall of 2008. Don't miss it!"
4,MARRIKAS Summer Weight White Goose Down Comforter TWIN,"More than adequate in thirty degree o/s temp, seventy two degree temp inside in central Florida. Quality appears to be good. Satisfied."
3,10 good movies that deserve better,"On the surface this seems like a great compilation, however the DVD transfer quality is very poor (not to mention the irritiating distributer credits that pop up during the middle of the films!) Carnival of Souls is still a great surreal horror classic, but you should try to find it elsewhere. There are no inserts or production notes inside the DVD package to tell you anything about the films either. This is a great lineup, but the films deserved better treatment."
4,Great,it's realy a great book containing hit's such asBlack NightStrange Kind of WomenLazy (Live:Nobody's Perfect)Highway StarSpace Trukin'Smoke on The WaterWoman From TokyoBurnKnockin at your back DoorHushit has all the tabs and the notation. plus for people who know alot about Theory stuff about what key the song is in. and it also has some about the bands history.although there's a few more song i would of liked in the book but still great
4,Death of a Gunfighter,I enjoyed the movie. It is a classic western and I would recommend it. It had a fairly good story and good performances by the stars.
2,disappointing,"The picture quality is quite good and the concept is great,but the memory card from my Sony camera did not fit the frame -- this was a nasty surprise. In addition, you can't rotate photos (even though they say you can) so you need all your photos to be either vertical or horizontal in a slide show. Third, the software to transfer photos from your PC is simply miserable -- not user friendly and lacking in features. I recommend you hold off buying a frame like this until they get the kinks worked out. I am very disappointed."
2,"nice frame, but buggy software","The frame looks lovely, but when I loaded the software on my Windows XP machine, it couldn't find any of the photos on my computer; the directory remained stuck at the root drive C:/, and wouldn't let me enter a path for the My Pictures folder. I had to buy an extra Compact Flash card and write the files directly to it, and pop the flash card into the frame."
3,A Classic,"There is only one song worth listening to on this CD, but ""Don't Bogart Me"" shouldn't be missing from any classic rock collection."
3,For Bolaño fans and writers of doctoral theses,"Jorge Herralde here collects a a number of his articles, eulogies and interviews about the late Roberto Bolaño, a writer whose profound talent he recognised before many others. The book offers some interesting insights into the relationship between the legendary publisher and and the Chilean writer but many of the texts are available elsewhere and the book lacks sufficent substance to justify its....erm... ambitious price tag. I recommend it for Bolaño fans who've already read every published word by the ""detective salvaje"". Everyone else should start reading him now."
4,I Liket It!,"Eccentric, but I like it!Sad there's no more AC/DCsongs inside!I Love AC/DC, and this Buddha ""Reditions"" AC/DC it's nice for me.Ivan.-P.S:I realized that the intro of the song ""Thunderstruck"", is not exactly the classic original intro. I think it is wrong in this cover version, because the intro is the riff from song ""Who Made Who"". I think they linked Thunderstruck riffs with ""Who Made Who"" melody, but it was not so bad the Thunderstruck cover in this way."
4,Close but no cigar!,"Just received the new DVD release ... and while I was thrilled with Vicker's portrayal there were a lot of things that bothered me about this production. Yes, far too many and too close facial shots and the lip synch leaves much to be desired because the vocal exertion on film never quite matches the vocal expression in the music.Nevertheless, I recommend this simply for Vickers and Von Karajan ... although I was not duly impressed with the surround sound balance. In all, it is a MUST for the serious collector ... but perhaps a more modern recording would carry more effective musicality. I have the Domingo recording .. nice also, but again it lacks the immediacy of a live performance well executed."
2,Good but not nearly enough,"The quality of the DVD's is good, and the new sound mix is excellent. However, there are problems. First, during Status Quo the voice track is not in synch with the video, this continues throughout Eric Clapton's set. Also, compared with the original broadcast in 1990 on MTV, much is missing. Pink Floyd's set, McCartney's set, Robert Plant, and the Clapton supergroup all had long sets on MTV, but for some reason are edited down here to almost nothing. Why it is so watered down is a mystery, and a total disappointment. The festival itself is 5 stars, remarkable, but this DVD can't generate more than 2 becuase of the poor effort. I'll have to take my MTV tape and make a DVD-R out of it, I guess."
2,Great acts...poor sound quality.,"Good mix of acts, but not sure if the windy day plays a part on the poor quality of the sound. Even the camera work is not the best...had I seen the DVD prior to purchase, probably would not have."
2,A little disappointing,"There are a few really good performances, Clapton, in particular but there are enough of groups I don't care for to make me fast forward through a bunch of it."
3,"Where's Mark, Eric, and Elton?","I suppose I should email Amazon . . . . I ordered this DVD to see and hear Mark, Eric and Elton, but did not receive the disc where they performed . . . . why not? I suppose it is inevitable - order so many CD's and DVD's something is bound to go wrong! One out of ten isn't so bad."
4,"Great, But Not Fattburger's Best","I love almost everything by Fattburger, including this CD, but the only outstanding number on this album is ""Anything's Possible."""
2,Omix replacement fender,"Fender is lighter than original, doesn't fit over shock mount without being cut out more. Curve doesn't match grill contour too well either. It will work long enough till I get my oem fenders redone and back on."
5,Definite page turner,"This book has it all: suspense, mystery, romance, action. The author has developed characters the reader gets invested in and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Good writing and a great story that will stay in your head long after reading the book. If you read one book this summer, this is the one!"
5,Not good for foreign retirement didtinations,Do you have any info. for american retirees living in Maxico and other foreign destinations. What reputable companies handle investiments and early retirements?
5,Nashville Mandolins,"This CD is a good combination of what mandolins and other string instruments can do together. I recommend this CD to people who enjoy the instrumental sounds of Blues, Southern Music and a variety of instrumental music that can be played by the awesome sounds of the mandolin. In my older years I have more time to flavor this type of music that soothes your mind and makes you think of things above this earth. And I am not talking about drugs....may I say...But the candor expressed by the players of this CD.If you like good instrumental music and want to explore the wonders of the Mandolin...no doubt this CD will be good for you...A musician is a person who exposes his art in untangible notes that makes the inner part of you soar like an eagle...and the Nasville Mandolins do give you the magic touch that will be worth your while..."
4,good but could be better,"...was pretty easy to follow for the most part. Just wish there was more close ups of the more challenging poses..it was also a little hard to follow at first because I am a beginner and when I looked at the three people who were doing these poses they were all doing a pose in differnt ways ...probably because some are more advanced than others...Overall, I am enjoying this video and think it is good to add into your routine."
1,Poorly written,"This book was a very poor choice for someone looking to learn about voodoo. The majority of the book is stories from the author's past and long pointless anti-christian rants. As someone else pointed out it seems like this book is meant to help sell the author's other books, as there is frequent mention of and reference to them.Very little useful information to be found and not worth slogging through the garbage to find it.I ordered this book in the hopes of learning something and I was sorely disappointed."
5,Very practical with many fascinating personal accounts,"Urban Voodoo offers the reader a system of magic that is powerful, practical, and sometimes shocking, and from the personal accounts given, the authors have obviously practiced this system. In many small ways, the reader is given some measure of encouragement that he/she can take this system and use it to empower him/herself to improve his/her own life. For that reason alone it is worth reading"
4,"""Rough Guide"" is a cut above","The ""Rough Guide"" series is primarily intended for a British/Australian audience, but American readers will nevertheless find them very good resources. In fact, the different perspective may make it more valuable than the Fodors/Frommer's standards. The Guide for the Sunshine State is no exception. Much more honest and balanced than most guides, it pulls no punches and comes off genuine in its recommendations. When the writers don't care for something, they say so. It's a refreshing change from the glossy chamber-of-commerce copy that is typical in most travel guides. While nothing revolutionary, this series is definitely a cut above the norm."
5,'visceral third degree',"Raw emotionality bleeding through all our best tourniquets, you clamp on the smile but the stains show through. This is everything you wanted to say but couldn't, the kind of cd you buy and then leave on the doorstep of that certain someone without a note or a name. Visceral and burning with an aching sadness and a sweet nostalgia all blended in together. Sometimes harmonious, sometimes discordant, always real and honest and pure."
3,Great but wears out fast,"I love this vacuum cleaner but I've had 2 in the past 2-1/2 years and both times, the head broke off after about 12-15 months. I'm not a fanatical cleaner either so it's certainly not due to overuse. :)It's relatively inexpensive and I've found others to be less efficient so I'm buying a third one. The company really should send out a replacement part to re-connect the head but I'm too busy to deal with them. If it happens again, I'll probably write this one off and hopefully find something with a longer ""closet-life."" Good luck."
2,Great replacement for a 2002 RSX Type S,"I have a 2002 Acura RSX Type S. I installed this belt in about 45 minutes in my garage.Cons:There is a small amount of squeaking during hard turns, this may be because it is still getting broken in.UPDATE: It squeaks quite a bit more now. I have read other reviews online and people report that this belt is too long for the Type-S model. I checked the tension level on my auto-tensioner and it agrees. It shows that the tensioner is past where it should be indicating that the belt it too long and therefore too loose.I will likely replace it less than 5000 miles after putting it on. Stick with OEM for the Type-S:[...]"
2,Boring,"I could not stand to continue viewing this film after half an hour- so boring! Boring script, background music in the wrong places, Lee Remick looking like just another actress in her nicey-nicey ""girl next door"" saloon girl role. Another Hollywood movie that was just so superficial in all its aspects. A small-minded shallow movie for small-minded shallow people."
4,Clear Central Thesis Laid Out with Occasional Tedia,"First of all, this is book to be read for its cogency of thought rather than entertainment of exposition. Secondly, the central thesis is important: that France is politically on the verge of ideological bankruptcy; and the recent events of the French political scene can be understood by the corrupt and cynical dealings of a handful of political celebreties. Thirdly, the centerl thesis is laid out with frequent hisorical, anthropological, and other cultual digressions. These digressions are probably necessary to provide context for the uninitiated, and are frequently told with considerable relish. The trouble in reading the book, however, is that some of the digressions are told with repetition and, to this reviewer anyway, with occasionally undue relish."
3,The Worse Service Dpartment in the Digital Universe,"Good Camera nice color beautiful image, as time goes by image dulls, Good Camera nice color beautiful image, as time goes by image dulls, focus softens, if you have to get it serviced -Forget it! I had to pound my way all the way to the CEO in New Jersey, took 3 months!Stick with Cannon, they have it together, I have a DVX 100A from Panasonic and an XL2 from Canon, so I have the luxury of comparing, Cannon has it more together.The hardware on this DVXA Camera is also not as solid as the Cannon (that cheap red turn on and record button has been used by all models including the cheap one chip cameras, grow up Panasonic, the 24 frame per second does not allow you to be sloppy in other fields. But I am not a panasonic fan."
5,stick to da man,"well,as far as making an indie film and winning film festivals with this camera,,yes this camera is superior in quality,,and if you do manage a great film and make it as a film maker,you wont be sticking to your indie roots,,as robert rodriguez did,he said all that indie stuff and soon as he went with the big studios,,he left his roota behind,got the same big name actors in all his flicks,antonio banderas,,give me a break,,what happened to ,,oh ill give new and upcoming actors a try,,,what a bunch of crap,,and you will do the same,,money curupts,,dont you forget it,,and your film making will be generic too,,,but to get there this camera will take you there,,,"
1,Embarrassed for these authors...,"I am still looking for a book that shows girls at their best, not their weakest/stupidest/""please exploit me, I have no respect for myself""/most immature. These girls seem to believe since they know three other people who are behaving just as recklessly, they can throw common-sense out the window. Explicit passages and boring non-revelations throughout."
1,Disgusting and depressing,"Call me old-fashioned, but I grew up in a better time. Thank God I wasn't exposed to what these girls are at their young age. What a depressing publication. Filthy language and references to things they did made me disgusted. This could have been such a great idea. What are these kids EXPOSED to these days? No wonder there are so much drug/alcohol problems, suicides, teen pregnancies, and accidents among young people today. Every generation looks at its young people and sees the dangers and distruction they are going through, but when will it stop? It shouldn't be available to young people--it should be marketed to parents so they'll see what their kids are exposed to. I feel that the media is responsible in a large part for the things kids are exposed to today. AND making money from it. I wouldn't want a young girl to read this filthy, depressing thing."
3,High School Prestige,"The publisher calls Stuyvesant High School ""New York City's most prestigious public high school."" Those of us who graduated from Performing Arts (of ""Fame"" fame), Music & Art, or the Bronx High School of Science might want to debate that claim. Still it's curious that this book got published and that the authors were interviewed on the Today Program (04/13/2006) by Katie Curic."
1,I bought this machine for my mom.,"Bought pay year for my mom for Christmas. Put it together as the instructions said. Put distilled water in the reservoir, turned it on and waited. Not much steam came out of the wand but lots of steam came out of the electrical cord inlet that you plug into the wall!!! Scared us to death and I ran to unplug it before we got hurt. I rechecked everything we did and tried it again with the same result. I talked to the company and they told me to box it up and send it back. I am a disabled vet living on SSD so I didn't have the money to pay for shipping to send it back so I paid all this money and my mom never got to use it. It sits in her closet. I told her to throw it away its not safe to use. She feels bad cause I spent the money so she doesn't wanna throw it away. I've never had anything like this happen to me when I've bought anything so I'm pretty unhappy. Oh well, live and learn... No I can't recommend this steamer to anyone."
3,Jiffy J-4000 Pro,The steamer does a good job It does take a while to heat up...my biggest issue is the wand holder where I usually hang whatever I am steaming is extremly short & does not nearly accommodate my tall husbands polo shirts ....the main reason for this purchase.Jiffy Steamer J-4000 Pro-Line Commercial Garment Steamer
1,Not worth the price,"I purchased this product over the less expensive ones in order to get my hanging drapes really steamed out with a professional look. It didn't work....or, it might have if I'd have had several days and countless hours to stand with the small head barely moving over every inch of the fabric. It's also very heavy once filled with water. I haven't even bothered to try it on clothes, because I can't see that it would be any better. The big disappointment was the manufacturer will not allow returns on any opened box....so, duh? How are you supposed to check it out? Now, I'm stuck with a $200 steamer that's in the way. Anyone want to buy it?"
2,Removes wrinkles but you will not get the ironed look,"This J-4000 steamer does remove the wrinkles but you will never end up with the same look as ironed clothes. Its such a big hassle to hang the clothes and then steam, it sure does take getting used to. Also you will want to take the wait time into consideration to steam your clothes, you need to fill up the tank with water, pre-heat and only then will you get the steam after a few minutes. I believe it is not worth the effort for what you get! You will always need your iron even though you have this."
2,It takes ages to make steam!,"I was hoping this expensive product would work better than the cheaper steamer that I needed to replace. I am waiting at least 15 minutes, maybe longer, for this machine to produce any steam which is way too long when you want to quickly steam a garment. I could get the iron and board out quicker and be on my way before this machine gets going. I was out of town for 6 weeks and missed trying for a replacement, in case there was a problem with my steamer."
3,Good Followup,"""Life"" seems to show some maturity in Dope's sound. I really wouldn't say that this CD is much less heavy than their 1st, but most of the songs are more melodic & have catchy tunes. In my opinion, ""Life"" is better than ""Felons..."""
3,No Good,"I loved the first Dope album and was stoked about getting the new one, but it was a great disappointment. I miss the harder beats and speed of the original album and the vocals just aren't as good as they used to be. Dope is beginning to sell out and their music just isn't as good anymore"
3,NOT FOR NON-NATIVES,"Be aware, this book is NOT FOR NON-NATIVE SPEAKERS! 80% or more of this book is in Tagalog. If your not a native speaker or don't know a lot of the language, best to steer clear of this title for now."
4,Beyond the Basic Level,"If you read the back cover of this book, it states that is is for the student that has advanced beyond the basic level... it is exactly what it states, a grammar book that was written to follow after Dr. Ramos' book Tagalog Structures. I find this book very useful in furthering my knowledge of Tagalog and would recommend it to any serious student of the language."
1,Sorry I bought it,"I've been buying Panasonic VCR's since they dropped below $1000. Most have had the Dynamorphous Metal Head and recorded better precision than my TV could display. Playbacks were indistinguishable from live TV. Not so this piece of junk.It apparently has a cheap head that delivers a fuzzy picture filled with color noise. The remote is totally illogical and extremely difficult to use.The commercial skip is nice and so is the fast rewind. But, perhaps because it is so light (full of plastic?), it is very noisy, particularly on rewind. One has to also wonder what the fast rewind does to the tapes.Don't waste your money."
5,Terrific Book - needed!,"Myers & Scanzoni have written a solid middle-ground book that builds lots of bridges. I hope that folks on different sides of the chasm will use this book to heal the terrible divide on gay marriage. Well written, easy to read, clear arguments, lots of information. Glad to read such a carefully balanced book; wonderful alternative to the angry bombast coming from both sides of the argument. - Tom Eggebeen"
5,A Great Western.,"This is a western for everyone, even if you think you don't like westerns I believe you will find this one very interesting. It is not just shotting, it has real drama & the ending is surprizing."
1,A real cheap imitation,"I was very disappointed with the quality and construction of this part. First the finish is not smooth. Also, the seal is plastic and white color (should be black). There is a white plastic band around the mirror that screams cheap !! The original mirror did not have this. The treads do not allow mounting and securing the mirror in the correct position. I had to use a rubber spacer on the treaded shaft so it could lock in a facing position. Do not buy this cheap stuff! Go for the real one."
5,Wonderful machine -- it doesn't perform miracles though,"Over time this machine will save you far more money in dry cleaning than it ever cost. Do not expect miracles though. If you think it will replace ironing shirts or pants you will be sorely disappointed. It will remove most wrinkles from ""wrinkle - free"" pants and shirts. Do not expect them to look freshly starched. For most of those items that need dry cleaning, it will remove the wrinkles from daily wear. I have a blue blazer that is fairly light weight that it does not work with -- the blazer looks like it was caught in a fine spray -- sort of ""peeblely"" looking. On the other hand most wool slacks and wool sport coats or suits it works miracles -- quickly removing wrinkles. Do, however, let the cloth dry and cool off after steaming (a few short minutes) before donning-- otherwise it will wrinkle again fast. Highly recommended -- if your expectations are reasonable."
4,Residential Jiffy Steamer,"It works as good as a professional model, so much better than the others I have tried.Well worth the extra money and not as expensive as a pro model."
1,Buy the commercial grade steamer or high quality iron instead!,I returned the item the following day as it does not remove the wrinkles on woven fabrics. I was so disappointed because it was not powerfull enough to remove the wrinkles unless you want to keep steaming for 30-45 minutes. If you're in a hurry and does not like ironing it is best for you to buy a commercial grade for $100.00 more. The other reviews sound really good but I think these people only wear knit fabrics or does not know what is wrinkled and not wrinkled. WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY AS I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP IT BACK TO AMAZON.
4,"Note heat-up times, if you're debating between the J-2000 and J-4000","I haven't bought either item yet, but I think I would to start out with the ""personal"" J-2000 line. Thanks to everyone for reviewing the steamer! For those who might want to UPGRADE to the J-4000 (you do get more power and the extra attachments as one reviewer suggested), make sure to note that the commercial model has a 15-20 minute heat-up time (an important detail which is ommited in the item description), while the J-2000 is ready in about 2 minutes; so that the consumer version would be best for daily use (if you're on the go and always have to figure out what you're wearing for work at the last minute). The J-4000 seems best if you don't mind waiting for the steamer to be ready, if you're going to steam several items of clothing for future use, or use it for bigger jobs most of the time."
5,One of the best pieces of equipment you can own,"This is a fantastic piece of equipment. I researched steamers for weeks before purchasing, and finally settled on this one because it had the best reviews. They were well-deserved! This product takes less than 2 minutes to produce lots of steam. The metal hook where you hang your garmet is sturdy, allowing for better steaming, and it is easy to remove and fill the water container. Also, this removes wrinkles after one slow swipe with the steaming wand. No, this does not put creases in pants, but it removes wrinkles so easily that you won't miss the crease. That is what an iron is for, if you ever decide to use one again after this beauty.Note: the best way to steam is to hang the garment, place the wand INSIDE the garment, and slowly run the wand down, from the top to the bottom, while holding the bottom of the garment firm with your other hand. This may sound involved, but it isn't. It is very easy - after you do it once, you get it."
4,Great product. I rarely iron anymore!,"My parents had a clothing store growing up, and we always used a garment steamer to get the wrinkles out of the clothes. I have wanted one of these ever since, and this steamer lived up to my expectations. The only thing I would change is the hose is a tiny bit short and the wand is not metal, but it still works like a dream. The base is really sturdy and solid, and it is ready to go in less than a minute. My only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner."
3,"Nice to have, but not life changing",Still getting the hang of using this steamer. It works beautifully on sweaters. On blouses and tops it takes out wrinkles but is not as crisp as an iron.
1,Works great when not leaking,"I purchased this less than a year ago. The unit worked great for approx 3 months until I woke up to a soaked floor. The unit leaked between the bucket and the steamer. I inspected the entire steamer and can't figure out how or why it's leaking. I called Jiffy and was told that the unit is under warranty (one year) and should be returned to Amazon. I contacted Amazons return department was told if I cannot exchange the item, only return and receive a 'reduced' refund. So I'm stuck with a steamer that needs drained after ever use. I will not buy from Amazon or Jiffy again simply because of the customer service."
1,Cracked and Bleeding!,"My husband and I gave the Jiffy Steamer J-2000 Residential Series 1300-Watt Garment Steamer as a wedding gift to our niece in May. We received a call from her today, June 1. According to our niece, THE STEAMER IS CRACKED AND LEAKING SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF WATER. I looked into returning the steamer, but Amazon requires that I PAY RETURN SHIPPING COSTS AND WILL ONLY GIVE A PARTIAL REFUND. We're embarrassed, and now we must purchase another steamer for our niece. To be certain, it will not be Jiffy Brand.We DO NOT RECOMMEND this product."
4,NOT TOO BAD,"Its a good product. When i first bought this, I steamed everything.But my use gradually tapered off. I did find other uses; had the steamer melt the tape residue that was stuck to a window.The product quality is there. and if any thing is broken, you can actually order a specific part for the machine and replace it instead of throwing the entire machine out. I like that.If anything, you should order the model with the interchangeable heads so you can use the machine to steam more than just clothes, such as mold/mildew and cleaning. it'll be more expensive but you can squeeze out more uses.other than that, if you only need to steam clothes.. find a cheaper one with the clothes hanger bar. after all, as long as the machine produces consistent steam, its exactly the same but cheaper!"
5,"A vigorous, moving read","Black Gold Of The Sun: Searching For Home In Africa And Beyond is a lyrical memoir telling of a prominent critic and Afro-American writer born to African parents in London. Always between two worlds, Eshun set off for Ghana in 2001 to find his roots: Black Gold Of The Sun chronicles his journey and search for both self and cultural influences, and makes for a vigorous, moving read."
5,Good thing I didn't listen to the critics! It's GREAT!,"While I was waiting for this movie to arrive, I searched out comments from the critics. Sadly, I didn't find a lot of glowing reviews. Most were downright tepid. But I don't know why ... I found it an excellent movie that I've already watched again several times. I expected to like it simply because hot Aussie hunk Adam Garcia is in it. That was great to be sure. But the movie itself was really good in my opinion. Getting to see Adam dance is just the icing on the cake. A good story, a hot guy, and some great dancing. This ain't your grandmother's tap ... Bootmen rocks!"
4,Pretty good,"I haven't had any major problems with this TV.. it seems fine. I don't really understand the negative reviews--it's got great features at a good price, and seems to work well. Picture quality is good, as is the VCR and internal radio feature (which I actually didn't know it had, but am very happy to know about now!)... my only problem is in the menu system, a characteristic Panasonic failure.It's a good deal, and has good features. Overall, an extremely worthwhile investment. We bought this to replace an identical version of the same model which lasted us a good three years--in that time, Panasonic hasn't seen fit to change it (if it ain't broke...). This baby isn't going anywhere!"
1,Are you fricking kidding me?,"Five hundred bucks for some average looking jeans with paint splattered on them? If you are interested in that sort of thing, talk to me, I can set you up for much less. And don't buy jeans online anyway, they are one of those things you just have to try on. The best part is how the pre-worn look and paint are supposed to make them look like they didn't cost that much. Please, head on down to a department store, get yourself some forty dollar jeans and a paint brush and give the other $450 to some charity."
1,JUNK!!,"OK, I read that Panasonic was the most reliable VCR,.... From day 1, it won't take about 30-40% of my tapes, it just spits them out. I'm talking new tapes, blank tapes, from the video store, it just doesn't accept some for some reason.When you rewind a tape, it sounds like a 747 is taking off in the next room. I can't believe how loud it is.Stay away from this model."
2,"Good but won't take tapes, makes noise","Less than one month, will only take certain tapes when our 8 year old VCR still will take the same tape. Noisy playback. Well thought out design and features for price but lacking in performance."
1,died in 2 months,"The machine seemed fine for the first few weeks, then got harder and harder to get a tape in. Eventually, it just stopped accepting them at all. Luckily the store took it back. After three VCRs in one year, I am considering the possibility of copying all my tapes to CD and just using DVD."
3,Panasonic PV-V4522 4-Head HI-FI VCR,"I just received the unit and attached all the cables and powered up the VCR. For the money - it will do for what it's worth. The manuals are usless, and so is the tech support for the VCR.My advice is - there are so many VCR's out there for more money, why invest in a VCR that you may keep for a few years."
1,Horrible picture,"I bought this VCR and hooked my cable through it. The picture I got from that was so horrible, even after making sure all my cables were good, that I didn't even bother trying a tape in it before I returned it. I would not recommend this product."
4,Great blade grinder,"This is a great grinder! I paid a 1/3 less than this at Target, so for what I paid, it was an excellent value. I use it to grind coffee for my coffee press & it does a good job & it is so easy to use! You set the dial, set the amount to be ground & then push the button & watch it rip. I don't have problems with my lid coming off like the previous reviewer but I am only grinding a small amount so it might not be as prone if it isn't full??The grind is not uniform like a burr grinder produces but it is plenty satisfactory for press pots & drip makers. I have no bits in my coffee so I am happy! The adjustments work well & are flexible.I am very pleased with this grinder but I would not have bought it if it cost more than what I paid. I recommend going to your local Target & paying what it is worth!"
5,get it straight people....,"Well hello al that dare venuture into the wonderful world of blumchen. Just wanted to let you all know that the parylyzer is one of several DJ's who mix the dancable tracks on this album and no she is not turning into a purely pop she will release an album this Fall 2002 so blumchen fans fear not, there is much more of her music in the process and on the way.-blumchen RuLz!!!"
5,MUCH bigger than I anticipated...,"I was expecting a holder for one or two pair of sticks, without any pockets or anything. WOW. This thing is MASSIVE. It's got a nice front zipper for accessories (cleaners, moon gels, felts, etc.) If you zip it open, you have enough pocket space to put 5-6 pair of sticks in it. The nice little BEATO logo wasn't on it, as the picture shows, but I don't really care."
2,Not good for Childs Indoor Plays,I have two kids 6 and 3 so I take alot of photos. I used to have a Canon 12 optical but only 3 megapixels and very bulky BUT took excellent shots indoor low light and far far away! So I bought this cause of the compact nature yet with 10 optical it was the first ever I have found. Well I am very disappointed. Indoors auditorium style with lights on this camera would only take decent shots if I did not zoom and even then they were very dark. My old camera never had a problem with that. I share my photos often and all my distant relatives that do not even know I changed cameras commented that my shots had gotten blurry and not very good. Hence if you are going to take just outdoor or in very lit indoor upclose setting this is a good compact choice. After using this camera since Sept 2006 I am considering going back to a Cannon...yes bulkier but my shots are my memories.....
3,Disappointing!,"I bought this because of the small size, ease of synch with computer, and the digital zoom. But what good are all these things if the picture quality is poor? And poor it is."
1,Defective right out of the box,"To save time, below is an excerpt from the email I fired off to the Sunnylamp Corp regarding the lamp I purchased.""Regrettably, the projector lamp you sent me is defective. Right out of the box, the bulb was not secure to the plastic housing. I carefully attached the metal retaining clip. After inserting the lamp into the projector, the first message to appear on the screen was to replace the lamp. The lamp is so dark that I had to increase both the brightness and contrast to the maximum limits. It is worse than the original lamp that needs replacement. I tried it for a few days, but it is unbearable to use.""Now, I'm waiting to see if they'll honor their product - I'm hopeful."
3,Seems OK but still found some grass residue,"I suspect this helps keep your cutting deck mostly clean but I still found some dried grass clumps. still, a good idea to use it to keep it from getting overly caked with grass."
5,Great movie,Great actor and actress's in this movie. I loved it very good movie. He means bussiness when it comes to his granddaughter.
3,"Name dropping, comma splices, and sentence fragments","This book is a fast and easy read that details the life of 'Diva' Bush and the role she played in the Gold Club. The stories of professional atheletes and celebrities alone are worth the price of this book but what I found most interesting was Diva's account of an 'entertainer's' day to day life. The book is very poorly written complete with sentence fragments, comma splices, mixed metaphors, poor grammar, etc. - but then, Ms. Bush never claimed to have a Ph. D. in English. Overall, it's a very interesting and entertaining book."
2,"""FALSE ADVERTISEMENT""","WHEN I READ THE BACK COVER OF THE BOOK IT SAID THE READER WOULD FIND OUT ABOUT THE OCCURENCES OF PROFESSIONAL BALLPLAYERS ACTORS AND POLITICIANS INSIDE THE GOLD CLUB. BUT WHEN I READ THE BOOK I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT SHE KEEPS ALL OF THESE PEOPLE NAMELESS EXCEPT FOR HERSELF AND FORMER GOLD CLUB EMPLOYEES. AND WHEN A CELEBRITY DOES ENTER THE CLUB SHE REFERS TO THEM AS A BIG SPENDER WITHOUT EVEN GIVING YOU A DECENT CLUE WHO THEY ARE. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE READING THIS BOOK ARENT NEARLY AS INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT ABOUT JACKLYN ""DIVA"" BUSH AS THEY ARE IN THE CELEBRITY ESCAPADES THAT WENT ON IN THE CLUB. BE CAREFULL BECAUSE THIS BOOK ISNT GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING AS FAR AS THATS CONCERNED."
4,Real science / no UFO's,"Some folks may have an interest in topics like Stonhenge based on ""mystical"" attractions. Don't go here if that's your thing. National Geographic still gets my support for their scientific approach to such topics rather than taking the easy route, i.e. ""x files"" ear and eye candy. This program highlights research being done into the reason the ancients built, and how they may have used, this and other similar structures... as well as the communities that may have grown around these amazing human efforts."
1,Poor Quality at best,"Having tried this Panasonic model, I found it to be of the poorest quality and not worth the price. Better off getting a TV and VCR seperately.Panasonic's in general have suffered a major downturn in quality and a person should look to other manufacturers, especially if looking for a combo unit."
2,picture went away after a few months,"I bought this vcr and after a few months, the picture output was gone. I could get a picture on the tv when the vcr was off, but not when it was on, even on videos. I tried changing cables, making sure the channel was set right, but nothing happened. It would occasionally give me a picture after flipping channels or turning the machine on and off a few times. Was a good machine when it worked."
1,Defective on arrival...,"No amount of fiddling by the most electronically minded people I know could get this thing to work. The power kept shutting off within ten seconds of turning it on. Guess I'll return it and try paying more for one. I am VERY discouraged over all the radios, vcrs, ect., I buy at stores, because so many are defective in some way. After years of buying stuff from Amazon, this is the first time I've EVER returned anything."
5,Your baby will appreciate you,"You are sure to be appreciated by your son or daughter for selecting name from this book - ""A to Z Listings of Thousands of Names : BABY NAMES a new generation"" by Barbara Kay Turner. This book has thousands of names, the source of the names, how-to-spell them, famous people bearing the respective names, alternative for the name and many more. Many pages have a small box at the bottom with ""Less common classics : New, Unusual Names"". This makes your job still easier. The meanings of the names are very appropriate and convincing. You are sure to get appreciated by your son or daughter, i.e the new generation."
4,I don't use my iron any more!,"This item was in my Gold Box. Having used one when I worked in retail years ago, I decided to give it a try. I haven't plugged my iron in since I got my steamer!! Even my husband has started using it. He loves the way it quickly touches up his polo/golf shirts. It works great on cotton knit items that my kids wear and is a dream on silk and polyester based fabrics. This is one of the best products I have purchased this year!"
1,Conair steamers are not worth the price,"I have this Conair steamer and after limited useage it became very moody. Within 5 minutes the steam vent goes from normal flow to little steam to no steam at all. The water tank is completely full and the ""water shortage"" light continues to turn on. After playing w/ the shortage water button and it stays turned off it takes a long time for the steam to return and then it is very little. There is no constant flow of steam, I have to wave the hose around or grab the bottom of the steamer and move it back & forth and still must wait for the steam to flow. A friend of mine had the same Conair steamer to steam bridal & formal gowns and her steamer did the same thing as mine. When you need to steam garments and don't have hours to play around w/ the steamer, praying to get steam, DO NOT BUY THIS STEAMER."
2,"""removable"" cup??","I just got this & I have to hold the body of the grinder between my knees just to be able to twist the cup off, & I do not have weak hands or arms. There's an off-color joke in there somewhere.Doubt I'll be able to keep the grinds in the cup if I try to twist it off. Back this goes. Looks like a better deal on the box cover. :-{"
3,Hamilton Beach 80374 Deluxe Custom Coffee Grinder,"It would be great if it did not have a faulty on button, which works just sometimes."
1,Another Junk Coffee Grinder,"I got this in September and now its all ready dead. It says you have a year warranty, but they charge you an large amount for shipping. They also ask you to cut the cord off, take a picture of it, then email them proof that its dead... I the search continues for a decent grinder."
5,best little grinder that does a man sized job,"this is the best grinder around. I use it every day because I enjoy fresh brewed coffee every time. In fact, my friend ordered it because of me. When the plastic cup went I was able to replace it right away. It is a great product."
1,Not really the greatest.... but,At first I thought it was great then all of a sudden the button does not stay on to grind and you have to keep taking to top on and off to get it to restart again to get the coffee to grind the way you want it!This is an update... I did call the 1-800 number and they are sending me a new machine FREE of charge... even no shipping charges!
1,"Worked fine, for about three grinds","Bought this grinder looking for something to grind enough coffee for my wife and I, we drink one or two pots a day. After a week of use, it began smoking and something had clearly burned out. Returned promptly without question from Amazon.Contrast this to the $20 grinder from Walmart I bought a few years ago that performed just as well, but only wore out when the plastic literally broke apart at the seam holding the lid down."
5,Just what you want!,This is a great grinder. Pour coffee in and set the dial to the type of grounds you want and push a button. Done! The grinder automatically stops once it reaches the proper grinding level. The stainless steel cup makes it really easy to change out types of coffee or grind spices without cross over in the flavors. The cleaning brush makes it really easy. Retractable cord winding using the base will keep it from wearing out like the cords that are on a pulley system. Couldn't ask for more.
2,it broke,When I used the coffee grinder for the first time it smoked and Quit.It obviously was factory defective.Amazon has a well organized return system that works! KUDOS
2,"doesn't pick up dirt, leaves streaks galore","This worked fine in the little apartment I used to be in with linoleum flooring in the kitchen--not that I cared much what my floors looked like then anyway with two roommates.But now I'm in my own house with a husband. We've got some sort of fake wood flooring and the wet jet leaves streaks like crazy on it and it looks filmy after use. Since the swiffer sweeper doesn't pick up crap as far as dirt or hair goes, the wet jet just gums up all the dirt and hair and leaves it stuck to the floor. Lovely.I strongly regret buying a wet jet and a swiffer sweeper for this house. I should've thought more about a nicer house vs. low level apartment. With all the replacement pads, etc... we've gotten it's probably been a nice hundred bucks wasted on swiffer. I'm searching for a better alternative."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this item thinking that it would make mopping easier in my kitchen. The pad doesn't pick up dirt as well as advertised. It picks up small dirt and spills, but just pushes other things around. You have to sweep very well before using. It takes 4 batteries which died after 5 uses. The cleaning formula that you have to use with the Wet Jet gets used up very quickly. There is no way to refill the container with water or anything else....they make you buy more solution (which has a very strong scent). It is a racket! You have to keep buying cleaning pads, solution and batteries. Not worth it!! Now it just sits in my shed and will not be used again."
2,It Works Great for a short time... : (,I think I have had 3 of these. And they work great. But then they stop working...or just break. Very very cheesy design. These are like disposable actually. I hate the swiffer solution myself. Smells nasty and toxic. If you use vice grips you can get lid off bottle and refill it with any green cleaner you like. Too bad nobody has come up with something like this that actually lasts.
2,"Works well, but is it poisoning me?","I love the way this works , but the second time I used it the no stick coating starting coming off in my food- black strips of plastic -like stuff. When I wrote to Nesco about it , they sent me a price list to buy a new liner. I do not believe I should have to pay for that when I only used it twice. Also I asked them several times what the coating was and could it be harmful if it came off in food. Only after threatening legal action, did customer service tell me it was harmless. I hope that is true , but now I am reluctant to use this cooker and surely don't want to pay $18.95 for a new liner that might do the same thing again. It would have been nice if they had offered to replace it. I am going back to Rival for a slow cooker now."
1,Not Impressed With This Item,I purchased this item from Amazon because I needed a new crock pot and was not impressed with its performance. The surface of the cookwell scratched easily. I purchased this to use like I had used my crock pot and it did not cook as I expected. I finally threw this one in the trash and went back the store and purchased a crock pot.
4,"Love the Game, but...","I love this game and am addicted in a matter of minutes. In fact, most of the Sierra city-building games are pretty addictive. However, the one thing that does wear on my nerves is the ""real-time"" factor of how long it takes to get through some of the architectural items in the game. Maybe pyramids (Sierra's ""Pharaoh"") or Chinese architecture took 2000 years to build, but I don't nearly have enough time in this lifetime to get through it in my game! That aside, the games are great, and ""The Emperor"" is pretty engrossing and fun. Just make sure to limit the number of hours you allow for this game or you'll forget that life exists outside of the Emperor's China! By the way, check the homepages of these games often to download patches for improved gameplay."
2,Emperor: ROTMK - Good Graphics - Not a War Strategy,"I liked the evolvement part of City Building, but after playing for hours, I get bored because the aspect of adventure and war gaming is not there. Can't expect to be a best game, but it will only last one / two round of play."
4,Great Game,Though the intro takes a while to load thats probably the worst part. After all it could be worse. The graphics are ok but somtimes the music can get on your nerves after a while. The online play addition from the other City Builder Titles is a bonus too.
2,Weakest in the series... but a recomended speed read,"If you're a LW fan I'd strongly recommend this books, but only if you speed read it to keep up with the series and move on with all the background to the later (and much better) books.This is one of the few books you could skip if you wanted as Letty isn't involved heavily in the later books. If you want to read later books in the series and read fast enough to breeze through one of these in a few evenings it's not so bad to pass it up."
4,PERPLEXED,"I ENJOYED THE WHOLE SERIES OF LAUREN WILLIG'S BOOKS. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE MADE THE CONTEMPORARY CHARACTER, WHOM IS WORKING ON A PHD AT HARVARD TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN EMPTY HEADED HIGH SCHOOL GIRL WAITING BY THE PHONE FOR A GUY TO CALL HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE HISTORICAL WOMEN IN THESE BOOKS ARE STRONG CHARACTERS. I DIDN'T GET OR MAYBE DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE."
1,-,"People will probably be butthurt over this, but I don't understand the hype surrounding this series.I've read at least as good, if not better work, from teenage fanfiction writers. The writing tries to be clever with its analogies and literary references, but ends up flopping when considered in the context of such a frivolous plot.Spy intrigue was uninteresting and dragged on to the point where I didn't care what happened with the story or characters. Romance was passable, but illogical and has too many loose ends. Minor characters were interesting, but not featured."
2,Audio out is TOO loud,"I had hoped to replace a Samsung V1000 with this and found that I can't hook up my externally amplified speakers to it without blowing out the house. In comparison, the Samsung has a volume control and output levels that are reasonable.The remote was confusing, as was the options for using the different features. It would be easier to have two separate components. Although not perfect, the Samsung does a better job of integrating the DVD and VCR functions and includes a tv tuner."
1,Less than a year old and already broken,"I got this last December and in August, the DVD started messing up. An hour into every DVD we watch, the screen starts skipping then hangs up altogether! We can't turn it off when that happens, either - we have to unplug it.I'm really not liking anything Panasonic anymore... I also have one of their digital video cameras (yuck!)"
3,sequels usually stink,"The first installment of the cheerleaders was pretty good,but the other two were lame."
2,What a mess,"OK, the structure of this book is not bad, the chapters covered overall appeared to make for a good read. I further have to admit I have not worked through the whole book yet, but who prove-read this book? There are so many errors in there it is no fun whatsoever to work with the code examples. And if an example has no error it has inconsistencies like projects being named differently in two code blocks/screenshots.I definately do NOT recommend this book, especially not for experienced SQL Developers as the Author rambles the first 80 or so pages on how to use Select, Insert and Update statements with putting only little weigth on the T-SQL enhancements of SQL Server 2005."
1,Very Disappointing,It pretty much is like someone reading a manual to you and showing you on video. There is really not much about using the plugins or techniques in using the plugins that you don't get from the manuals. It justs shows features and describes features. The product manuals you get with the plugins are much better as you can go through them at your own pace. These videos race through product descriptions much like sales demos describing features of the products.A real waist of money.
5,A Confidence Builder,"This book is different from the other ""how to"" painting books. It addresses the greatest artist block--fear. If your canvas is blank because of perfectionist's ideals and being overwhelmed by the ""big picture,"" this book is for you. It takes you through several exercises of timed paintings intended to make you forget about getting it perfect and have fun with your painting. The idea is that with practice you will improve and enjoy painting again."
3,For beginners only,"This book is all about painting quick studies. I would not recommend this book to professional painters. The author is very particular about what colors to use, what brushes to use, and how much time should be spent on each step of the process. To me, this became somewhat tedious to read. Very little emphasis is given to aspects like composition. The pictures in the book are mostly quick studies with few finished works at the end. The basic message of this book is: paint more, and your skills will improve."
3,Jet Stream Oven,"I love cooking with the Jet Stream Oven. It is a very healthy way to cook things crisp without adding extra fats. However, the ovens don't last very long. The motors give out quickly."
1,Horrid Machine,"This has to be the worst dehydrator ever made. Not only is it so loud I could hear it out in the garage when I was one the other side of the house with multiple closed doors between me and it, but it also did not dehydrate well at all. Most of the items I tried never fully dried out. I used it a few times and got rid of it."
2,Works but makes work,"I have had two of these dehydrators. The first one I used maybe a total of 20 times and by then the tray parts where the food goes started melting together. I bought another recently thinking maybe the problem was fixed in a newer model, but after about 8 uses the tray part were the food goes is starting to get warped from the heat. It looks like if I keep using it will soon melt together as my old one did.It is also a pain to get the food out from between the little spaces, even if I wash right after turning off, soak in warm water, use a toothbrush.... I spent 1 hours trying to get stuff out between uses."
2,Not a fire hazard,"I was very excited about my new food dryer, sliced up a bunch of zucchini, laid it out on the trays, pluged in the top and...the fan did not come on. The heating element briefly glowed hot red and then went dark. So, nothing worked at that point but it was no longer a fire hazard. It must have some built-in fuse or thermocouple to disconnect the heating element if it gets too hot.So, I returned this item and will get one that is more expensive and hopefully more reliable. If you're lucky enough to get one that works, hopefully it will continue to work for a few years. It otherwise seemed to be a decent design for distributing warm air across the trays."
1,Don't get it,"Don't get this product, it simply would not start after the second time i used it. It only has an on/off switch (no temperature options), and it is a cheap product. Spend a little more and get a much better dehydrator."
3,Too Repetitive!,"I was one of a very few group of people who got the chance to play a test version of the game. The graphics are very good, but everything is just the same old thing! Yeah there might be a couple new races, Characters, skills etc. but in all this game is almost like the older ones! If you are a die-hard fan of these games buy it but if you aren't get the demo first!"
5,WarCraft 3 Rocks!!!!!,To Some It All Up This Game Is Awsome!!! First Off If You Like RTS(Real Time Strategy) And RPG ( Role Playing Game) Games This Is The Game For You. Not To Mention The Graphics Are Sweet And There Are 4 Different Races To Choose From And There Is Free Online Gaming Though The Use Of Battle.net (Which Is An Awsome Online Gaming Service). This Is A Must Buy Game!!!!
4,A new story concept,"This Game is fair to the high standards of Blizzards and has on its own developed a new kind of PC Strategy Story Board.The new concept of the Heroes does fairly well and adds a large chunck to the development of the story, which is without doubt excellent, interweaving four different fates, never lacking suspense or surprise.The graphics do very well in the game play, but are just three steps ahead from being cartoonish. Overall the Story takes to much from the gameplay and the strategic thinking of the playeroften bends under the weight of the already compeltely scripted story board. This Game, rather then being an excellent strategy Game, deserves to stand on its own as a high quality entretaining product, developed with passion and a love for detail."
3,Not that bad!,"Given this game wasn't the greatest Blizzard has evercome out with, but it's not that bad. I enjoyed playing it, but I did see several shortcomings. The plot did [stink]. The cut-scene graphics were eye candy, but looked too fake. Didn't follow storyline that great. If you are a blizzard fan of a Warcraft series fan, then I'd buy this game. I just wouldn't get my hopes up on a great, out of this world game."
1,Terrible!,If you are a action/ strategy gamer- this isn't the game for you! The graphics are too intense for a slower computer and the gameplay is basically the same thing as warcraft II. Get empire earth instead!
2,Great but not so great,Blizzards new installment into the warcraft world is an obvious atempt at bringing the worlds of starcraft and diablo into the already chaotic world of warcraft. The introduction of the hero that can gain experiance points is great for the single player missons but when it comes to a standard multiplayer game I just want to build up my base and attack when Im ready and not worry wiether or not my enemie has already gotten his hero to level 9 or not. The graphics sounds animation cutscenes and gameplay are great but the whole idea of heros makes me wanna go see whats on TV.
2,"Sorry. Same as WarCraft 1, LONG LIVE NEW IDEAS.","Well I have to say the movie shorts between levels are the best thing in this game. I figured that after all these years, they would of gotten some new ideas for this game. In fact I felt that I was play the first WarCraft, with a little more eye candy. This is very hard for me to say about this game, because I'm such and huge fan of the WarCraft series. They need to bring back the free demos, so you don't waist your money."
2,Same old stuff,"WC3 is just another RTS. The addition of heroes is nice, but (game balance issues aside) isn't enough to make this game feel new and different.If anything, I found WC3 to be a step in the wrong direction. The single-player campaign is so highly scripted it feels like a Sierra game, where every two minutes the computer takes control away from you and you have sit and watch another cut scene. The maps are very restrictive, with narrow pathways (you can't walk through wooded areas) channeling you down one or two directions in every level. This left me feeling claustrophobic.The levels make the game feel more like an old 1D side-scroller than a modern, open-ended ""3D"" game. The combination of heavy scripting and tightly constrained levels means there is zero replay value in the single player campaign.If you want a RTS that really has a new and different feel, try Kohan Immortal Soverigns and Kohan Ahriman's Gift."
3,John,"Ok game but hard to get use to. I uninstalled it after about 5 times trying to understand how to play. My son loved it, Good kid game but for an adult i would go for something else."
3,=(((((,Nah... dis ain't good'ol' Warcraft. Too much graphics but too little gameplay.it's just a WarCraft2 that wants heavier hardware. not worth buyin...What they should have done with StarCraft2 they did with with WC3. bad move...
4,A truly great game,"Amazon.con sent me this classic in 4 days! I was amazed. Anyways, I played it for a few days, and then it crashed. Probably my fault, so I just ordered a new computer from them.That aside, the game is well-done, altho a little demanding on your system. I met the minimum requirements (barely), but I would strongly suggest at least 256MB of memory (I had 128), and 64MB of graphics memory (I had 32). Processor speed is un-important (My 1.2GHz was plenty).Having said that, this game is great for both Warcraft novices and old pros alike. I played Warcraft, Warcraft II, and now III. This one doesn't disappoint. Just remember to get DirectX 8.1 in there first (I did, but still got whacked by my 3 year old system)."
5,"Get this game, it is insanely awesome!!","I love all video games especially PS2 games. I'm not usally attracted to computer games, but Warcraft is an exception. Fantasy games are the best and if you like them get this game! Ok, ok, the graphics could be better, but overall it is an awesome game! I always play battlenet non-stop for hours and hours! This game ROCKS!"
1,"Nice wood finish, but workmanship is poor","The piece looks beautiful. The design is very practical, but the execution lacks a lot. First item I received had one of the legs almost fall off - it was improperly glued. The other leg was wobbly. I sent the piece back for a replacement. The replacement came and the legs are still wobbly and feel like they could disconnect from the board at any time. Sent the item back for a refund now."
2,Beautiful but too delicate,I had this tray for about 4 years and then it fell apart after daily use. When I bought the replacement I was very happy but within one week the veneer became pretty badly scratched. I wouldn't recommend this for daily use if you want a beautiful object.
3,It dos`ent have to be scary to be good,Well it`s about a old barn that the pony pals find.It`s a very good story.And when one of the pony pals touches a horse shoe on the wall it is hot.But they don`t know why.Lightning is very scared when she hear`s a chain rattleing they all know there must be a ghost but in the end they don`t let you know if it was real or now.I won`t tell you anymore so you can read it yourself.But I think that not all books should be scary because this is not a horror series it`s a horse series.
4,Nice pillow!,I have wanted a memory foam pillow for some time and this price was great! I really like the pillow - I just wish it came in king size.
4,A fun and very different British mystery.,"When I first started reading this book I didn't quite know what to think. However, I quickly found that I was having quite a bit of fun reading it. Beaton fills the book with plenty of interesting suspects and no one is more offbeat than the detective Hamish MacBeth. For a light and enjoyable read I can't recommend this book enough. We don't learn that much about Macbeth in this story, but if future stories he becomes more of the focus of Beaton's novels. The MacBeth novels have quickly become some of my favorite British (or Scotish to be more correct) mysteries."
3,Cozy is the perfect definition,"This is the first book in the Hamish Macbeth Series. The book was enjoyable, yet it seemed similar to cotton candy, good, yet not filling. There were very nice settings and a solid mystery at the heart of this book. One of my biggest concerns after reading the book, was that I did not really take to the book's hero. I have read the other reviews and will probably give the other books a chance at some point."
2,Not worth the hype,"I'm a 19 year old student. I bought this movie on the recommendation of all previous reviews and I was very disappointed. I found the jokes to be predictable, the actors dull and not funny (I only laughed once), and the plot disjointed. Also, although this wasn't really a problem for me, I don't think it looks like a big-budget studio film at all. Buy this movie and you may be disappointed."
5,"Just like my life, but with alot more humor and wit.","What can I say about this movie that the pope didn't cover at world youth day? It rocks! I still am curious as to how an independent film can be so professional looking. Funny, well acted, great screen work, and so many great lines that you will be quoting it for life. Please buy this film!Ah, there's nothing like being totally loadedand writing movie reviews."
5,A college film for the new millenia,"...This movie is one of the funniest college films to come out in recent years. It's a darker look at college life as five friends cheat their way to a 4.0 their sophmore year while doing nothing more than doing drugs and shooting things ... and the occasional kidnapping.It's based on stuff that actually happened in the life of the director/writer, which makes it that much funnier. The DVD is full of extra features that add to the insanity, such as the Helen Keller version of the movie, and a documentary of actual footage of the people the movie is based on.The perfect movie to watch during a night of drinking with friends, it makes everyone else's life seem a little more normal."
2,"Sort of cute, but horribly overpriced","I bought this for my daughter, who is almost 4. It is cute, but there is nothing that sets it apart from any other plastic playset. Except, of course, that it is triple the price it should be! The school came with two baby critters, 4 school desks, two play blocks, a sink, a baby pool and some accessories. The accessories, which consisted of two boxes, four books, four notebooks, and two pieces of plain yellow felt (which I think are supposed to be rugs) were cheap and poorly designed. They were made out of cardboard, paper and stickers and you had to assemble them yourself with terrible directions. Keep in mind that they are about the size of a postage stamp, so it was frustrating and clumsy. I ended up throwing half of them away. My daughter is enjoying playing with the babies, but I don't think the toy was worth anywhere near the price that I paid."
5,Cloverleaf Corners Nursery School,My granddaughter loves this toy. She loves playing school and uses most of her calico critters when she plays with it.
2,Divas missing,My opinion is that the whole show should have been in tact. Some of us prefer one artist over the other. I am disappointed to hear that the duet with Cher and Cyndi were left out. Those 2 artist are a legend in their own time. Really bad mistake mad there......
3,Not what I expected,Overall the book was written well and full of interesting tales. I expected more pictures and more places that could be visited today. Mostly the book was of tales up to 200 years old. I suppose I could have read the description closer to what the book was about before purchasing it.
1,A little Sad,"I have only read one entry in this book after hearing that a certain family in Danbury CT was written about. I found the entry to be very cruel towards these people. As someone who had run into this family on several occasions 20 years ago at a diner and ""The Finest"". They did not deserve the treatment received in this book given the fact they are/were most likely suffering from a genetic disorder."
2,DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET,"I received ""The Flower Princesses"" BOOK TODAY AND RIGHT ON THE FRONT COVER IT SAYS THAT THE BOOKS EACH COMES WITH ""20 GLITTER TATTOOS"". THIS BOOK DIDN'T COME WITH A SINGLE TATTOO ANYWHERE INSIDE AT ALL. ALSO, THIS BOOK WAS TO BE A GIFT, BUT THE WAY IT WAS PACKAGED THE BOOK COVER HAS DEEP FOLDED MARKS ON THE FRONT OF THE BOOK AND ON THE BACKSIDE. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY TO RECEIVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS,PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.COM BUT THE ACUTAL VENDOR IS - WINTER VENTURES.I SUGGEST THAT THEY SEND ME A NEW ONE WHICH HAS THE 20 GLITTER TATTOOS INSIDE AS THE BOOK SPECIFIED THAT IT DID HAVE. SENDING BACK THIS BOOK ISN'T WORTH THE MONEY TIME OR TROUBLE, BUT IF YOU INSIST, THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO SEND ME A POSTAGE RETURN LABEL TO RETURN IT TO YOU.VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE FROM YOU.(SOLD BY WINTER VENTURES)MRS. INEZ PACHECO"
5,Highlander Revenge is Sweet,"I really enjoyed this movie with Duncan Mccleod and vanity I relly liked how the ending turned out to, I liked it from beginning to the end."
4,"Great show, too much sexual content","I love Highlander; probably my favorite show ever. But I have one problem with this series: too much sexual content. I know that probably sounds prudish, but I didn't care for it at all, and it didn't help the story or character development most of the time."
5,There can be only one!,"Great show. Duncan McLeod is a hero. My scottish fold cat is name Duncan, Duncan McLeod of the clan McLeod there can be only one! Excellent show."
3,Where are the CLOSED CAPTIONS or SUBTITLED?,"When it first came out on television on USA station, along with Le Femme Nikita, both shows I never missed an episode! I even taped it so I can watch it over and over again. But when I first purchased the DVD set few years ago, I was really disappointed it wasnt CLOSED CAPTIONES or not equipped with SUBTITLED feature like most DVDs out there! I gave it a 3 stars, a missing star for each feature! I hope they add those features for old and new fans alike!"
5,Good show.,"I remember this show from the 90's and I enjoy watching the reruns now. It's not always well written, but I like the concept."
3,The limits of technology,"The picture quality is the same as the DVD (as other reviewers have noted), but the Tsuka borders are a nice use of space."
1,potential fire hazard,My 16 year old son made this product while I was not home. After 90 seconds the container started on fire. The microwave is burned and my son may have have been injured as the item continued to burn. He used an oven glove to remove it from the microwave and throw in kitchen sink. I am lucky to not be visiting my son in a burn unit now. If you value your home and children do not use this product. I reported this to Kraft who is claiming this is not a safety issue.If it has happened to you report it to Kraft so this dangerous item is removed from the shelves.
5,outstanding scraper,"First, the fact that this high quality scraper was made in the USA delighted me, plus the German carbide blade is still usefully sharp after many many hours of scraping an old utility shed. Nice balance and grip.For a manual scraper, this is first class."
3,"tactics, indeed","This battle system is configured like a chess game. You actually need to think to win a battle. There is a story line in the game, and the graphics are pretty bad compared to the graphics done today, but that's because this game is old, so don't expect graphics like the ones you find in Final Fantasy 12. Over all, an interesting game, but if you're looking for a game with awesome graphics and blood and gore , this isn't the game to look for at all. If you don't like to think while playing video games (like me), then this also isn't the game for you."
4,some fun stuff,"I was really looking forward to this game, as I had read some great reviews of the tactical battle system. The game is fun, but it hasn't held my attention like I had hoped. I really enjoyed FINAL FANTASY TACTICS, but I didn't find the DYNASTY TACTICS storyline quite as compelling. The laundry list of chinese names (no pun intended) becomes almost ridiculous.There's some fun stuff going on here, and I can tell that with greater attention to the elaborate battle system possibilities, it could emerge as quite a strategic and mental challenge. I also get the feeling that two player mode would be a ton of fun over the one player mode...I'd love to see my brother's face as I cranked out a multi-combo on his arse. ;)If you're someone like me, however, with limited time to play video games, I wonder if this will offer the satisifaction you're looking for. Though a recent purchase, I find myself passing it up in favor of other games when in search for that quick fix."
1,does not fit newer laptop,My laptop is 1 yr old and this cable does not fit. The newer computers do not have 9-pin ports and the only adapter I could find was $37.00 at Best Buy. The 9-pin end on this cable is female and so is the one on your computer. I strongly advise shopping around first before buying this cable because it probably will not fit your computer.
5,Telescope Interface,No issues getting the cable going to connect my goto telescope to the software on the PC. Works great! I would definitely recommend this cable.
3,"A lot of information, but not in a very coherent style","From her youth onwards the author was intrigued by the planets and in this rather slim book she describes each planet: its properties, its moons and (of the planets that are far away) the history of its discovery. This is quite nice and it is good to get all the information sorted out in short, very readable chapters, but my main objection is that the author every now and then loses herself in romanticisms: especially the chapter on Venus (the morning and evening ""star"") is full of lyrical poems. On the other hand there are chapters that only have a rather dry list of facts about the planets to which they are devoted. This makes the book al in all not very coherent, but not unpleasant to read. I think that people with a decent knowledge of this astronomy will not get a lot of new information out of this book."
2,Not For Science Readers,"I really enjoyed the parts of this book that were about recent discoveries in astronomy, especially when the author wrote about the newest landers to collect data from Saturn's moons, and how our knowledge about distant parts of the solar system has evolved. Unfortunately that was pretty much only the last chapter. Her frequent poetic digressions and occasional (and occasionally lengthy) reflections on the history of astrology are boring and won't please the reader who is actually interested in science. But, to her credit, she is clearly passionate about learning and better understanding our universe, and her passion for discovery shows in this book."
1,Just Awful,I think the author spent 15 minutes on the internet to research this book. There is nothing in here that a 6'th grader doesn't know.But besides there being no content to this book the worst thing is the style used by the author to write it. If some thing could be said in one sentence she uses 100. The prose is painfull to read. After reading half of this book I threw in in the garbage where it belongs. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,If you are looking for overwrought prose,"this is the book for you. I suppose this is ""artistic"" in some circles. I picked up the title because I love astronomy. I have taken several courses and I was expecting something different. It has it place, just not on my shelf. I found the book to be moderately interesting. This is not a astronomy book or a hard science book."
4,Sophisticated and eloquent but lacks a concrete purpose,"This book is not a continuous narrative and need not be read in a linear method. Dava Sobel's ""The Planets"" is a collection of essays inspired by our solar system. I usually balk at reading essay books and I wasn't particularly enthused with this book.The Good:""The Planets"" is as sophisticated as a mainstream science book can get, rife with references to poetry, literature, history, and religion. It discusses the planets in context of mythology, popular culture, and mainstream literature.The Bad:Sobel seems more concerned with eloquent and flowery language than with a concrete purpose and resulting conclusion. Also, Pluto is no longer a planet!The Conclusion:This 'page-turner' is a great read if you're at all fascinated by the planets and the cosmos."
2,Hire before you buy,"I was suspect about parting with the cash on this one, and boy, was I glad I hired it out before I bought it. This game is boring beyond belief. I hired it out and played it nearly all day, one Saturday, looking for reasons to buy, and sadly they were lacking. The game is really slow, and the goals seem very unfocused. Playing the same levels over and over with no real challenge isn't any fun either. I don't think the game is hard, just lengthy (which isn't good when it is boring). Half an hour to achieve one boring goal, get rewarded with nothing, but a key/banana or some other item, which unlocks another area. Repeat. This is not a fun game. This is not a pleasure to play, like Zelda or Mario 64.I'm sure some people will really love this game, but not me. Hire before you buy."
1,One HORRABLE game!,"This is not what you'd expect from Rare or from the Donkey Kong series. The game has a really basic plot: The bad croc is going to blow up Donkey Kong's island. Everyone, including me, was expecting super graphics from the expansion pack (which you need to play this game). Not true. The graphics are a bit better then the average game, but not as good as they could be. The game is remarkably similar to Banjo-Kazoie (another 1 star game) in that you learn moves as you progress through the game, something I HATE! The characters also speak in mumbles that get annoying. However, probably the worst part is that the game play is boring and it is hardly challenging. I beat the first level fully and almost beat the 2nd through 5th levels in the first week I had it and I haven't touched it since. The only good part is the multi-player mode. So, if you're going to buy an N64 game, look elsewhere."
4,Pretty Good,"Although a little overwhelming at times the game keeps a fast pace and, assuming you're the type of player that enjoyed Mario and Banjo-Kazooie, you'll love this game and you won't get bored any time soon. If you're not that type of player don't even bother."
5,Greatest Game in History. Period.,Donkey Kong 64 was the longest and most fun time I've ever had playing a video game. This one ranks right up there with classics such as SMB3 and Legend of Zelda as the true great ones. EXTREME REPLAYABILITY!!!!!!!!! SO MUCH TO DO IN THIS GAME IT ISN'T FUNNNY!!!!!!! Simply the greatest!!!
3,One of the only good n64 games,"great graphics, not enough action. the whole game is basically collecting golden bananas to unlock worlds to collect more bananas. It is a good game however and is a steal at the price amazon is selling it for. it is identical to banjo-kazooie/tooie, so if you played those games and hated them or are tired of them, dont buy dk64, personally i found dk country more fun on snes, but that is just me."
1,"boring,confusing",this game was very confusing i cound not tell were i was or anything i was going nowere and i couldn't figure out what anybody was talking about
3,Could Use a Little More Heart,"With ""Donkey Kong 64"", Rare has produced a very large, good looking game. I have to say that, after finishing 50% of the game, I found myself bored. The problems are a little technical, but mostly I feel the game lacks heart.My only technical complaint is about the camera angles, which are really out of whack. The main letdown is the fact that ""Donkey Kong 64"" feels like ""Banjo Kazooie 2"". It's nothing but a scavenger hunt without any real rewards. There's no adventure. Just search, search, search. The real fun that I have experienced with this game is the perfect four-level recreation of the original 1981 ""Donkey Kong"" that I unlocked. It only shows that sometimes great graphics and size are no match for simplicity and challenge.If you buy any 3-D adventure games for the N64, get your hands on ""Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"" or ""Super Mario 64""."
5,"different style, but even better","I grew up playing all the Donkey Kong games from the original to the Donkey Kong Country series. DK 64 is alot different from any of those in all respects. It's 3D and theres not any real fast-paced action like there is in the others. However, there's so much to explore and do in this game that it's even better than the others. Everything about it is awesome, the graphics, control, sound, and it's fun. When you finally beat the game, the original Donkey Kong, Rambi's & Enguarde's arenas, and the multi-player should keep the replay value up for as long as you have the game. You can even play the bosses anytime under the mystery menu. THIS GAME NEVER GETS OLD!"
2,Requires expansion pak,When I purchased the N64 version I was disappointed that it required an expansion pak to play it. Now I have to wait a few more days for those to arrive to play one of the best games ever made.UPDATE: not the game I thought it was. Donkey Kong COUNTRY is the version I remember as a child.
5,THIS IS THE BEST DK GAME OF ALL!,"This is the best N64 game of all. The graphics are the best but sometimes the camera view is annoying but that is a minor set back. The goal is to get 200 golden bananas and to get 100% of the game done. I've had mine for a few weeks and I already have 145 golden bananas and 65% of the game done and I still have school. I play it so much because it is plain fun. If you get it though, you might want to get a player's guide because it is pretty tough. So if you are looking for a cool N64 game that is also challenging, get Donkey Kong 64!"
3,"Good, but gets rather montamous(sp?)","This is a great platform game, don't get me wrong, but Rare made the mistake they frequently make with their games: THERE IS TOO MUCH COLLECTING AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION. I got tired of trying to get every banana, coin, and blueprint that the game had to offer. The bosses are too easy.This is basically a kids game that tries to confuse a long game with a boring game."
2,Take it back.......,"This game is really bad. We had this game only a few months before we took it to a store to trade it in for Diddy Kong racing. The reason we did not like Dk 64 was that you had to find the people before you could be them. Very complicated for kids. Also, you have to go through many levels and it gets boring."
1,Eau de Campagne by Sisley,This is simply overwhelming! Too much greenery for me & my allergies. If you like a very strong perfume and allergies are not a problem you may like this perfume.I tried to give this away & NO ONE would take it! Beware.
3,Major demo to the Hutt.,"I got this as part of a collection, he came with Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker and as such was a good deal. He is well sculpted and his head doesn't turn much but I like him alotly. If only there was a Jabba to scale with him that wouldn't cost a fortuna!"
4,"nice, different, unusual...","very cool ambient stuff. and the CD artwork is cool too - something to read while absorbing the tunes, which remind me of swamps and water and things."
2,Blah..,"This may seem really stupid, but this CD definitely isn't within my decent genre range. Once in a while, there is a ""pop-punk"" song that makes everyone dance. I'm just writing this review because I'm searching for one of the songs from the trailer. I haven't even watched this movie, which could actually help me out, but I figured I could share my lack of musical knowledge with you nice folks. I'm wondering which song is played at the end of the preview where someone runs into a football pole, the goofy kid says ""i thought it tasted funny"", and what's his name is on stage playing the guitar. Some of the words are either ""I'm contagious, you're contagious"" or ""I'm ok and you're ok"". I'm guessing it's the second, though the first would be quite funny."
1,The Song you were wondering about.,"Well just in case your wondering the song that they play in the movie that is not on the CD is by a band called ""Bowling For Soup"", their song is ""Girl All The Bad Guys Want"", off their CD ""Drunk Enough To Dance"". So all the cool people that were smart enough to put songs down like Simple Plan that are already on the CD, here ya go!"
4,What Song Was Playing When....,I am looking for the song heard when Dizzy tried to get expelled. He took the camera and put it into the bathroom while the principal was dropping a deuce. Anyone know what the song is and where I can get it?
4,No-nonsense workout,"This is a challenging workout. I always break a sweat and I like how there are lots of moves which help build a strong core. Tamilee is not too perky or annoying, and she's good at explaining the moves. The two women working out with her look like Gym Class Barbie Dolls, but their abs give you something to aspire to. The only thing I don't like about the DVD is that there is a long manufacturer's introduction that I couldn't skip or fast forward through."
3,History of Austria-Hungary,"An interesting book, written in the 1860s I think. It briefly covers the various, and many, Hapsburg sovereigns from their empire's formation in the 11th century through to the author's present day. I found the book very readable, and a different perspective on history, in that I got a sense of the nature of the people, their character, and their strengths and weaknesses as individuals. The book also discusses the Reformation, and relations between Catholics and Protestants, and later Calvinists, and how those relationships motivated behaviour.I've not found a ton of books on Austria-Hungary or the Hapsburgs, so I was happy to find this book."
5,Very simple,"So I can't cook. Well, I can... it just doesn't always turn our right, or difficult instructions have me taking twice the prep time. All of the instructions were really easy to understand. And I didn't have to go hunting in 5 different stores for 10 different gluten-free flours! And these are the recipes that need to be translated for the gluten intolerant (a.k.a. anything with bread).I made a loaf of bread, and served it to my ""normal"" friends. Everyone loved it! One of my friends borrowed this book to make me an apple pie as a gift, and it was delicious!"
5,Fantastic book,"This book, and Joe Richard's previous book - Princess - are absolute works of art. Joe was a painter, and in these two books he was painting a picture with words. Princess is about his love affair with an old Friendship sloop, and Tug of War is about his experiences aboard tugs during WW2."
2,BORING!,"I read this as required reading for school, and I don't understand why, of all books, they chose this one. It was boring, seemingly pointless, and the so-called pidgin was way out of whack. I live in Hawaii, so I should know, where as the author of this book grew up in Cincinnatti!!"
3,One man's search for meaning,"The 'Publisher's Weekly' review pretty well says it all: this man is obsessed with aphorisms (a sort of bite-sized parable). I felt like the author got in his own way, though; in his enthusiasm for the form, he filled the book with his flowery descriptions (bring your dictionary), and managed to personally contribute very little of substance. I realize that aphorisms play with language to say the absolute maximum in an absolute minimum of space, but primarily the author only manages to communicate his enthusiasm for the form. Perhaps that's the point, but I'm not sure."
5,simply amazing!,"I bought both sets and the movie in one felt swoop after watching a few trailers and my brothers' recommendations and I regret nothing! One of the best purchases I have made in a good long while.The picture is great, the audio is great, awesome story, nice and compact set without taking up half a rack on my dvd shelf. Now I cannot wait until I can grab up the ""Brotherhood"" series which is based more on the original manga from what I'm told."
4,Good Book For Catty Lovers,I just finished reading The Prophecy and I am half happy with the book and half disappointed.First of all the storyline is that Catty and the other Daughters try to get the Scroll back from the museum before the curse destroys everyone. Then Catty meets her father who unleashes powers she has supressed. Along the way she finds herself falling for Kyle the dangerous bad boy who also paints.But anyways I like the book because it does focus a lot around Catty whom along with Serena is my favorite Daughter. But other things disapoint me. First of all it's always the same person to come and cause suspense and Serena is spending too much time with Stanton. And even if Catty's my favorite Daughter I would like to see more of the other Daughters. Also the book ends with certain cliff hangers.Overall plotwise I like it but add more Daughters and don't leave things too cliffy.
4,interesting,"This book was very interesting in the Daughters of the moon series. Catty has always been a favorite of mine and it was eye candy for me to read about her having to go back to the dark ages to see her father who happens to be a member of the atrox. The book is very good. i reccomend that anyone read it.Oh, and to note, if anyone has been reading the series it is obvious that Jimena is no longer a daughter, Tianna ain't been right from the start and Serena has always had a thing for Stanton and people who were introduced throughout the series always play a roll sooner or later. just wanted to clear that up. read the book"
2,Too expensive and not comprehensive,"It definitely should have been better! Pictures and info lack any real knowledge of the subject, and often times just had wrong information. Very disappointed. A big book with little value to me."
4,Very good shears,"I use a sharp boning knife for taking apart a raw chicken, which I find to be more accurate and easier than shears. But when it comes to butterflying one, shears are superior, in my opinion.My old shears don't come apart, making them difficult to clean. Moreover, that makes them harder to sharpen. Now that they're so dull, and I can no longer spatchcock a chicken with them, I bought these.They're excellent utility shears, but I'm going to continue using my old ones for non-cooking tasks, such as cutting string, paper, and so on. Because the new ones come apart, they'll be easy to sharpen.The only reason I've downgraded them to a four instead of a five is that they come apart too easily, sometimes in the middle of a task. They were difficult for me to put back together since I have difficulty with spatial relationships. Now that I've figured it out, that shouldn't be a problem. Still, they shouldn't come apart so easily.All in all, this is a fine pair of shears at a good price."
2,Wouldn't purchase again!,"I bought these because of all the glowing reviews and it seems like the pair I have is always dirty. But, I have to agree with the last review. They aren't sharp. They have lots of little gadgets attached, but I'd rather have a good sharp pair without all the extra stuff. I'll try to sharpen them and see if they are any better."
1,nearly useless,"I came across these tucked in the back of a kitchen drawer the other day. I'd purchased them here at amazon a few years ago. The Cook's Illustrated review played heavily in my decision to buy them.After receiving them it didn't take long for me to realize these were the worst kitchen shears I'd ever used in my 50 plus years of food prep. Tighten the nut, 3 cuts, tighten the nut, 2 or 3 cuts, tighten the nut, 2 cuts and they fall apart. At first I thought it was me, I was doing something wrong. But...what? They're scissors.They're sharp when the nut has the right tension, but that's going to last for one cut. After that plastic scissors will cut as well, and won't fall apart and stab your foot.How does junk like this get to the marketplace? I have to thank Cook's Illustrated for this one. They've been wrong a few times since but never more wrong than their rating on these 'shears'. They are junk."
5,"Open at least 3.75"" from tip to tip and do not come loose - Solid!","Just received these today. First off, they feel solid as compared to the kitchen and cooking scissors that came with my knife block.CLARIFICATION ON ANOTHER REVIEW REGARDING HOW FAR THEY OPEN BEFORE COMING COMING APART FOR CLEANING: I remember seeing a review (the ""HORRIBLE"" review) that said they only open 1-2 centimeters before they come apart. This is not true. I have a large hand and with the scissors open as wide as I can open them while I'm holding them with one hand in scissors position, they do not come apart. I measured from blade tip to tip and the scissors open 3.75"" and do not fall apart. If you open a little more, then they come apart for cleaning. This is not 1 to 2 centimeters like someone else incorrectly stated. You can easily cut chickens, etc. without worrying they're going to fall apart.Very happy with this purchase."
5,GOOD PRODUCT!!,"This is a great pair of scissors. I bought my first pair from the org. owner in Ojai, CA. back in 1987. he has passed away sense then. but his company marchs on. After I got these new ones. I compared them with my old pair. Just as sharp. The only changes are. a larger handle grip. and made in China, now not Japan. They do last. Cut chicken very well. SW"
3,A Collection of Essays about Joan of Arc,"Considering Dr. Wheeler was my professor for a Joan of Arc class, it was no surprise that this book appeared on the reading list. While she is an authority on the subject of Joan, this book is not a showcase of her expertise. On the whole is is a collection of ""scholarly essays"" that have drawn unusual conclusions about the historic heroine; thus the title Fresh Verdicts.For the person looking to learn more about Joan of Arc, Fresh Verdicts is definitely not the place to start, as it assumes the reader has a basic understanding of Joan of Arc and her historical context. Instead Fresh Verdicts is geared towards the student or Medieval scholar looking to expand his/her views and interpretations of a familiar figure."
5,"Great heating cap for on the ""GO""",This is great because you are not connected to an electrical outlet and can move around as you need.
1,CoolCastle Floating Habitat,"After being blown completely up, it began to deflate within the first house. And it has way to many different sections to air up and hook together. Doesn't not function at all like the photo."
3,gungrave,"this game rocks in my opinion . although it does have a few flaws. the game is short, has no replay value, and all u do is shoot to kill. but the game has very unique graphics like a cross between anime and devil's may cry. the playability and control is good . so unless u like anime and a ""kill them and nuthing else"" type of game, i suggest renting it period."
2,Blanket lifter is disappointing,"Not very well made, when you lift the little bars they don't stay put. I was disappointed with the quality. Rigging something up at home would be a better idea, I wish I'd had my husband come up with something, a waste of your money."
2,PERFUME PARA HOMBRES,"BUENAS NOCHES, EN ESTE PEDIDO YO SELECCIONE PERFUME PARA HOMBRE Y AHORA SALE PERFUME PARA MUJER, DE HECHO TENGO OTRO PEDIDO PARA MUJER, POR FAVOR CORRIJAN ESTE ERROR QUE PRESENTA MI PEDIDO.GRACIAS.GOOD NIGHT, IN THIS ORDER I CHOOSE FRAGRANCE FOR MEN AND WOMEN PERFUME SALE NOW, IN FACT I HAVE ANOTHER REQUEST FOR WOMEN, PLEASE CORRECT THIS ERROR TO SUBMIT MY ORDER.THANKS."
3,Good storyline,This book has a really good plot but it really needs to be run through an editing process. There are so many grammatical errors that it really takes away from the story. I find this to be true about the majority of ebooks that I've read so far.
4,"Not the greatest series, but a good story.","Ghosthunt is one of those obscure series that is actually pretty good. The story is solid, but I was just a little disappointed with the English dub. Definitely worth the buy as a S.A.V.E box set, though. If you like Ghost Hunters Ayakashi, this might be to your liking."
4,Awesome!,"Characters - fantastic. All have depth and pretty lovable. Even though we don't learn a lot about all of them, you still connect with them.Plot - so cool! There are a lot of great ghost stories in here. I've never been really scared by horror movies but even I felt a chill creep up my spine a time or two and came to regret watching this at night alone. Really hit that creepy factor. My only no here would be that, with each section featuring a ghost story, the overall interaction between the characters often falls by the wayside when it comes to relationship development or learning about anyone's past.Ending - like with most animes it leaves a little to be desired. Not everything is explained and most things are left unresolved but I still thought it tied everything up pretty nicely.I highly recommend it."
2,"my 9 year old loved it, i thought it sucked",Well I guess just because unearthed films put it out don't make it worth watching. I don't like cartoons but I still thought I'd see what this is. My kid can get some use from it so I guess two stars is fair. Check out my YouTube channel. Veryfinecrapvideos
5,Cranford,"This is a very wonderful story that the whole family can watch together. Humor and sadness both, So injoyable!!!!"
5,Wonderful Series,I first heard of this series when viewing the Golden Globe awards and it intrigued me. I enjoyed the series very much and especially the fine performances.
3,not as great as expected!,"I bought this series because one of my favorite british actors Judy Dench was in the series. We all loved the "" As Time goes By"" so thought I would give this one a try. I would recommend this for those who enjoy movies of that time era. I found it slow and not holding my interest, The reason being I'am not as interested in most films in the 18th century. Of course Gone with the Wind will always be a winner!"
5,Cranford,"This is a very engaging portrayal of the Gaskell novels. I truly enjoyed this and the most wonderful part was to see how the women were actually so in command of the town and daily life. As a hobbyist costumer I roared over Imelda Staunton's lace dilemma. that woman is SO funny. .. .even when she's serious. Judi Dench is absolutely marvelous as the weaker of the two sisters (can you believe it of strong Judi Dench?) and on the whole, the cast is brilliant--and followers of BBC costume dramas will recognize more than one or two familiar faces. That might be a turnoff for some but welcome for others. I received this DVD as a Valentine gift from my husband and will watch it again and again."
4,Cranford was a refreshing change.,"Sometimes I just like to loose myself in a miniseries. Cranford had the usual pursuit of love and romance, but had the added bonus of strong female friendships. I planned to watch an installment each day, but I got hooked and watched all the installments in one day."
2,Not like the novel,"The novel ""Cranford""by Mrs. Gaskell is my favorite novel of all time. I was so excited to learn they were filming a mini-series. However, I was so disappointed because it is nothing like the book. It certainly is ""based""on the novel, in that some of the same characters in the book appear in the movie, but most of the plot was made up, including most of the main characters. The book was so funny. If you liked the movie, you should try the book, but be warned, it is completely different!"
3,This is not a book,What's shown here are just the cards themselves (102 divination cards). The manual must be purchased separately.
3,Note the size!,"I ordered these cards after seeing a set that came with a book. I expected these cards to be the same size and to come with the book, but apparently these are miniature. It's clear in the listing, but I would not have expected to check there. I still love the cards, but now I must save up for the additional book so I can use them. Each card also has a little paper perforation imperfection, too, so do not expect nice glossy long-lasting quality."
2,Joke movie of Jaws,This is a comedy movie around the idea of a relatively small two headed shark. Its hilariously as there is no effort at acting and the storyline is just sillly. Its just a bunch of young people making fun of sharks.
2,Does anybody know the size of this thing??,"*Spoilers*In the opening scene this 2-headed CGI shark swallows two girls whole. Then later in the film it attacks a group of kids in about three to four feet of water!?!? It seemed to drastically change sizes throughout this awful, albeit humorous film.I think the moment that made me laugh hysterically is when the kids' teacher scratches his leg, falls down on the ground and screams like a 3 year old little girl. I also like the fact that their ship is sinking and the one left in charge (Carmen Electra) decides the best course of action is to sun bathe.Awful CGI, horrible wooden acting from a cast that I couldn't wait to see as shark chum and an incredibly stupid plot, (with MANY plot holes) kills this one almost from the start."
3,Missed Opportunity for Ending,"2-headed Shark Attack. Come on people, what were you expecting? This is the type of movie Ed Wood would have made had he been alive today, and it would have been the one he would've been remembered for. This is cheesy, this is bad. But at least, it's entertaining, unlike many of the high budget, high concept blockbusters these days, which are dull and unimaginative. The only reason I'm not giving this four stars is because of the disappointing ending. The filmmakers missed out on a great opportunity to set up the sequel:Where's the 3-headed shark that should've chomped down the rescue chopper at the end?"
3,Good Overview of the Ancient World,"This video, although at times sensationalistic, is a good introduction on how the Greeks and Romans viewed their Mediterranean world. From the Pyramids to the Colossus of Rhodes -- as well as the lesser known Mausoleum at Halicarnassus -- viewers get a glimpse of the 'wonder' as well as some general history. The video also points out the limited scope of these ancients: it makes note that structures like the Great Wall of China, unknown to the Mediterranean peoples, was left out. A good way to spend 50 minutes, this video is a decent overview of how the Western world saw itself."
4,Simply Incredible!,"I respect people's opinions on things, thus I won't bash those who gave this book bad reviews. This book is amazing. But as one reader said, you can't just read the book and give a review immediately after. You have to sit down and think about it. The book brings a whole new meaning to the meaning of life and its satirical look at society is brilliant. It may be hard to understand but try your best to get it. Anyone who puts forth no effort into understanding a book isn't a good reader."
4,Smooth Guitar Sounds!!,"I was tempted to buy this CD back in 1998 after hearing it on the radio. Loeb has a nice flow of music. Preferably on the tracks, ""Going South"" and the title track. I didn't mind some of the vocals, but its the smooth guitar sounds that I recommend on this album."
5,One of My Child's Favorite Books. Jefferson is Fascinating,"This book is one of my nine-year-old's favorite books out of a huge book collection. Thomas Jefferson was a fascinating person and a great role model for learning. He was a scientist, farmer, inventor, writer of the Declaration of Independence, president, governor, diplomat, founder of the University of Virginia, advocate of public education, etc.This is one of the best children's books we have read. Highly recommended!"
3,Holiday Gift Central,"The item I purchased, Bewitched the 5th season arrived faster than promised and in excellent condition. Five stars for that part. However, when duplicates of this item were received as a gift I tried to return the item using the information I found on Amazon for returns to Holiday Gift Central and my invoice. No response from anyone and it's now 2 months since I emailed them!!! So if you just want to buy and there is zero chance you might want your money back (or even an exchange, which is what I asked for to just get something else) perhaps Holiday Gift Central is for you!!!"
5,"Is ""Sinner Alert"" serious??",It's a TV SHOW. It's FICTION! Do you also think the castaways on Gilligan's Island were REALLY stranded on a desert island?
1,Program incorrectly reads the WRONG value of Poker Hands,"While playing Omaha Hold'em or Omaha Hold'em Hi-Lo periodicallythe program with state the one player has two pairs and the player has only one pair.(No Good).Or the program will statethat the player has a straight and the player only has a 4 cardstraight. I stop playing this game because you can't gamble withthe program incorrectly stating wrong value of hands. Therefore,not until Sierra remove the bugs or completely checks out Casino2003, I advise you to wait for the corrections. Otherwise itcould be a great game."
3,Not much improvement,Other than different computer people to play with there has been no real improvement. Your team mates still work against you while the opposing team helps you. The revenge button does help but I really want to hit the programmers who apparently don't know how to play cards. You won't get real life-like play like you do online playing with real players or at a card table but it's a decent diversion.
2,You're playing against your partner too!,"Characters are very stupid especially when playing a Spades game. After playing for a while, you discover that your partner is stupid and is getting you in trouble. You end up playing against your partner, by correcting his/her mistakes, as well as against the other team. Overall, the game is not bad; looking at its graphics and comparing it to other card games on the market."
1,Useless,This game collection is no longer supported by any system. Had I known that I would not have wasted the money.
3,You like boobs? I got your boobs right here on Savage Beach,"Biggest god damn boobs I ever saw. My GOD! Rent it alone, leave the VCR on pause and check out those gargantuan honkers. You will not be disapointed if you like big bazooms. I give it two nips up! You like Boobs?"
3,I would give it FOUR stars except for.....,"The fact that the toggle switch on the back of the camera -- that not only controls the Zoom but also controls all the command options on the LED -- seems to be the WEAK point, and not just for me -- mine is now kaput.The rest of the camera functions just fine and I have ENJOYED using this camera for more than 3 years. However, now the back of the camera has to be disassembled just to get at this little piece of (probably) plastic inside the body that has effectively stopped me from using this camera once the card is full, since I can no longer delete any photos, or format any other cards."
5,space music.,this cd is great. i have another cd from this seller and am far from unhappy. i recomend this group. especially if you like tangerine dream and steve roach. the deep sound texture is awesome. the choice of sounds they use from their keyboard is great
4,So Very Stylistic,"I am still trying to figure out if I love or hate this album. At first, I thought it was a joke. Then I realized that it's a delicious blend of early rap and electronica extremely well produced. The album is worth owning for the track So Stylistic alone. Have we finally stumbled upon a new sound? It seems so."
4,Ridiculous. Awesome.,"I rarely delve into the ""dance"" section of the record store, but Fannypack gave a me good reason to change my ways. With thumping bass, sparce sampling, and screetchy, sophomoric lyrics, this all girl rap trio takes me back to the late 80s when 2 Live Crew and ""Push It"" era Salt 'N Pepa rocked the airwaves. While songs like Cameltoe (""she had a frontal wedgie -- a cameltoe"") are so absurd they seem like Saturday Night Live material, the group's jump rope rapping style is so infectious that the music bears repeated listening. Of the Amazon samples, ""Hey Mami"" and ""Cameltoe"" represent the best Fannypack has to offer. If you enjoy those songs and don't find ""Do It to It"" too frenetic, you'll probably want this album for your next house party."
4,Nice start to a Rebuild or Restoration,"I would reccomend This book to anyone who is thinking about restoring or rebuilding a classic Chevy Truck. It is full of tips and ideas. For specfics on rebuilding systems of the truck you'll need more info, but to get started and to figure out if you even want to attempt a project truck this is the book for you."
5,Restore my old Chevy P/U ......really!,"A great guide for anyone wishing to restore an old Chevy truck, but fantastic for a newbie to the task! This book will help you decide the path you really want to take.. True restoration or a rebuild so you can use and enjoy your old truck. If you buy one book first, this is the one!"
5,Hamilton Beach 33141 4-Quart Oval Slow Cooker,"I just recently purchased the Slow Cooker, and was very impress by the price of it. And I would refer some of my friends to buy one also. It's very dependable, and do a great job in cooking my food. A.T.Kendricks, Center Point, Alabama"
1,Piece of junk,"This is truly a piece of trash. I put on lamb shanks with veggies a few hours ago, and although it has been on LOW the entire time, I just found the temperature dial and 'wings' melted. I now have to return it! What a safety hazard and piece of cheap c- - -. Do NOT buy this one."
1,This product is junk - don't waste your money!,"I don't know if it works, didn't bother to try. As soon as I opened the box, two plastic rivets fell out of the crock pot (which hold the black plastic jacket/handle to the silver/metal body). Everything was cheap, plastic and flimsy, with the exception of the ceramic crock and glass lid. I figured if the housing could fall apart so easy, it might become an electrical hazard down the road. So I immediately packed it up and shipped to Amazon for a full refund."
4,Does the job,No real complaints other then the cord could be a little longer. If your single or their are just 2 of you this is a good size. My first meal was a roast which was 4 pounds and it just fit. Really didn't have much room for veggies but it's just me so it works.This will also be ideal when if I make something and need to bring to a party because its not to bulky to carry around.
2,Ok performance until glass lid shattered,"I'm not a big review-leaver...usually I just move along after receiving a product, but I feel compelled to leave one for this slow cooker. We've had it for a few years but only recently (since having a kid), have we started to use it with anything approaching regularity. It's always been pretty trusty, if a bit on the hot side, but there are worse problems to have in a cooking device. I was looking forward to my slow-cooker tomato sauce tonight and was just walking into the kitchen when I heard a fairly loud ""pop!"" It turns out the lid had shattered and glass fallen into the sauce. I can't be too upset since it's past warranty and I'd like a programmable and larger model, but buyer beware!"
5,'Dead Days of Summer': Finest of a fine series,"This is Carolyn Hart's 17th mystery in the Death on Demand series alone. She can't turn them out fast enough for me. I loved it, all the way through.I had only two problems with the book: (1)I really relate to Max Darling -- what loving husband wouldn't? -- and he is incapacitated and powerless virtually the entire book. (2)For more than a hundred pages I believed I knew the identity of the murderer; I was wrong.What a fine read. And when is No. 18 coming out?"
5,Proven information/I tried HGH; it works!,"This book is extremely well written and well documented. It does not make unproven claims for HGH, and clearly indicates where the medical information is still inconclusive. The growth hormone product of the future referred to in the book exists now. I have tried it and it works! Must reading for anyone who cares about the quality of life."
2,"After following this for a month, I gave up, too hard to do!","I bought this book a little over a month ago. It reads well. The theory seems sound. The plan is simple. But man, trying to swallow all the pills that are recommended is just too hard! I worked up to 3 grams a day of the ""stack"" of aminos the author suggests, and even though I am practiced at taking vitamins, it just got too hard to do! I was taking as many as 15 or more pills per night, all at once, and it just wasn't realistic. Perhaps if aminos came in 3 gram doses this would work, but for now, with the highest I could find being 1 gram, it's just not reasonable to expect the average person to be able to handle this volume. Too bad, as I did like the ideas, just couldn't handle implementing them."
1,it just doesn't work,"Orally taken, (supposed), 'homeopathic' HGH 'precursers', 'secretogogues', or whatever they're being called in the latest industry scam, simply -don't work-. Ask yourself this: where are the millions of satisfied customers? There certainly are millions who have tried this stuff. Klatz is known to have connections with manufacturers that he doesn't mention. This book specializes is making _incorrect_ assumptions, such as:1/ If HGH injections work , then oral HGH will work 2/ If certain conditions can be helped with HGH, then HGH can further improve the strength of those who aren't sick, and 3/'1' and '2', as applied to precursers. If you read this book with wishful thinking, the examples may inspire you, but if you read with a rational mind, they will seem like the rediculous exagerations that they are. GOOD NEWS! there is one safe,effective way to up your HGH: short intense weight workouts."
3,Its OK,I read a little bit into this book and was a bit boring. It was a lot of stuff I already new but it is my interest.
1,PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS STUFF!!!!,"I know all this stuff seems like a good idea but have we forgotten GHB? That was supposedly the fountain of youth a few years ago and now no one hardly even talks about it. Let me let you in on a little secret, GHB turned out to be a very addictive substance and in fact a handy little trick to get a girl naked without any problems like dinner movie or even her knowing you for that matter. Like HGH, everyone jumped on it before all the data was in. Please put your money away and be safe. A pretty face isn't worth the trouble this could potentially cause. And lets be realistic at 60 you really won't ever look 20 again and the weight you would have lost will be the money leaving your pocket book and not the fat from your thighs. Work out, do yoga, and eat a healthy vegetarian diet and you can't go wrong. Also, when i stopped eating sugar the cellulite also disappeared and so did those extra pounds."
2,Fantasyland,"Lawrence and Hermia have a brief fling in college. Decades later, after failed marriages, they meet again to, maybe, find true love in each other. Right, this is a fantasy, somewhat along the lines of Cinderella. I have nothing against fantasies (Superman is one of my favorite characters). But Lawrence and Hermia, as presented by the author, have led detached intellectualized lives. The one exception to all the detachment is Hermia's relationship with her daughter, a disturbed relationship that provides one of the few somewhat interesting parts of this book. But the interaction between mother and daughter could not save the novel. By the end of the book, I didn't care what happened to Lawrence and Hermia, two generally uninvolved, boring people."
4,Beautiful and heartbreaking,"Wonderfully macabre story with truly great performances by the cast. Beautifully shot, cold, stark and moody - I loved it. Highly recommended!"
1,What a waste of money,"Honestly, I should have learned years ago to not listen when Stephen King says something is 'the best' of anything. This movie was actually given 3 stars?!? This was the biggest disappointment since The Orhpan. Your money will be much better spent on something else."
3,Packaging Only Review,"If you read any reviews from me, I always try to review Blu-rays on the product and not the film itself. If I wanted to read reviews on the film, I'd use Metacritic or a specific critic who I have similar tastes with. I don't understand all these reviews on the movie itself on Amazon, so anyways, onto the product...I'm disappointed with the casing, in general. It's the cheap recycled Blu-ray case that is flimsy because of the holes in the box to save the company money. Also, I've seen the Blu-ray elsewhere, which had a nice plastic sleeve that when taken off you could see the girl. This doesn't have that for some reason. Maybe they already jumped to cheaper casing in a matter of two months since the release date. It's strictly the cover printed out and put in the case.I don't think it's a big deal. It would have been nice to know, but the $13.99 price tag was well worth saving an extra $12 than for getting the one with a plastic slipcase at Best Buy."
3,Very DISTURBING because a CHILD did all the killings and explicit bullying scenes,"I've watched the original movie ""Let the right one in"" and this Hollywood version. This one is more terrifying because of bloody scenes and explicit killings. For example, the scene where the girl jumped down from the tree and bit the woman's neck.There are also some very disturbing scenes. For example in the locker room, the bullying was so rough that Owen.... Moreover, I was very uncomfortable after finding out that a child did all the killings.I think it's worth watching once for curiosity."
5,10/10. Fantastic Film,Im not going to bore anyone with a massive review. If you like vampire flicks THIS IS THE BEST.. well some might argue the Swedish version is better. I love both but I think Let Me In did so many more things right. Chloe and Kodi are magical! This is a movie thatll be with you for a while.The slipcover did come a little damage though. My only complaint
4,"An Unnecessary Remake? Probably, But At Least They Did A Good Job","First, the elephant in the room ... the original film, Let The Right One In, is easily one of the best horror movies of the past decade. For this reason, an American remake was almost entirely unnecessary. That said, everyone involved did a pretty great job with the material. The direction is dazzling, throwing back to 80's America instead of the cold backdrop of Sweden. The brilliant casting of Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee marks a rare intelligent decision by Hollywood. The tension is thick. It doesn't quite reach the highs that the original does, but if you've never seen it, or are really not into foreign films with subtitles, consider this one of the best horror films of 2010. The Blu Ray transfer is impressive, both the video and audio are flawless. Even if you've seen the original a million times, check this one out, you'll enjoy it."
5,"masterpiece of horror, all-time classic up there with The Shining","Fantastically well done horror movie. Horror genre meets the Oscars. It's anything but your typical slasher flick and infinitely better than all the torture horror that seems to be 95% of all they make these days. This film is clearly destined to go down as one of the greatest horror films of all times.very well directed, acted, shot, moody and artisticIn the end, I would say it is every bit as good as the original Swedish Let The Right One In. Each does a few things slightly better than the other. You sort of need to view each one twice in a row to appreciate each one fully otherwise which ever one you watch second you end up thinking it worse since you spend too much time comparing them in your head and not getting into the second one in the proper way. Watch the second one again and then you'll see it's as good as the other."
4,Like the remake better,"I just watched the original version of the movie, ""Let the Right One In"", and I think I like this one better. Maybe it's one of those instances where I like the one best that I saw first, but I just think ""Let Me In"" is better for some reason. Chloe M. is great, maybe a bit sweeter and more likeable than Eli, but also far more vicious. The juxtaposition of the bond between the Owen and Abby and the violence is more pronounced, and I like that. In any case, as far as remakes go, this one is stellar. It doesn't sully the original at all."
3,not too bad,"it is a low budget movie, and it shows, but you get what you pay for in this movie, not much"
2,SOAD has been cheated,"System of a Down is an extremely talented group. Their eerie melodies are captivating and intense. This tribute is a cop-out.As String Quartet Tributes to great artists goes, this one isn't very strong. If you are a fan of SOAD get all of their CDs. If you need strings, listen to the Kronos Quartet."
1,Northern Hemisphere only,I bought this under the premise that this item was functional world wide. I actually purchased two as presents only to find out that this item ONLY works in the Northern Hemisphere. Thanks for the heads up Amazon. NOT! Sadly I now have usless star maps - please check your item descriptions!
5,The plot dies but that doesn't matter.,"This book about a playwright and the artistic community into which he falls takes great pains to remind the reader that these people are Jews in Poland in the 1930s and that their entire way of life will soon be destroyed. The title character is the embodiment of innocence which the narrator desperately wants but has no tolerance for; a fact painfully spelled out for him by the other women in his life. Deftly the plot spins out of control and the people began talking more and more and before you know it you are in the ideas of what is God? Why do people suffer? Who makes the universe? What should be our place in it? Some of the most profound and compelling insights fall from the characters' lips. So profound that you forget that the plot has fallen by the wayside. Like Kundera, Singer can give us philosophy and compelling storyline and succeed marvelously in both"
3,"Good, but lacking","This game is fun, and a good retro-gaming title. However, the lack of variety in any of the 100 levels really makes this get REALLY repetitive. If you have a kid that doesn't like to do the same thing OVER AND OVER then do NOT get this game."
2,Horribly truncated!,"I have seen the 5-hour film version of Peter Brook's 9-hour stage play of the Mahabharata, and it is wonderful. WHY the producers of this new release chose to cut an additional 2 hours from the film, I do not know, but the result is terrible. The story jumps abruptly without explanation and leaves out vital plot points. The result is a disservice both to Brook's vision and the great epic itself. I am extremely disappointed and urge others not to buy this version. Make them give us the full 5 hours!(I meant to give it one star but cannot seem to change it now)"
5,chickens calm a new life in this memoir,"Who knew a memoir mainly about chickens could be so interesting? Catherine Goldhammer starts her life over in a house by the sea which might not look that appealing but has charm nonetheless. She divorces and her daughter, Emma who is 12, move about 1 1/2 mile from their old home and begin a new life. The only thing to ensure Emma's happiness at moving is to promise the purchase of chickens! There is heaps to do with setting up a new home and the caretaking of chickens is no small task.This memoir will surely entertain and inspire. Perhaps you will wish you had a coop of chickens in your yard by the end!"
2,Misled,"I was very disappointed as I was sent a DVD in French! It appears there is a way to get the episodes to play in English but French is the primary language, even on the cover! I do not recall seeing this in the description and felt very misled. When I went to go back and re-check the item on amazon it was no longer available."
2,Map lamp by Celestron,"The lamp is just about functional, but its construction is quite flimsy, and the leds provide an uneven illumination. In view of its low price, nothing serious to complain, and it is good that it has a dimmer function. Good lamp to read maps in the night. And only that."
1,Terrible material,"I had to return this soft sleeper. Not a very heavy material and therefore it didn't help the bed at all, made it worse of anything. Go the extra price and buy a better one. Would not recommend this."
2,Not very informative,I was disappointed in this book. I was looking for more information on the subject and it was a story book. If you are looking for information on dyslexia this is not the book for you.
4,Outstanding game,"Mystical Ninja is one of the funniest games I have ever played. It was so addictive, that the first time I rented it, I didn't take it back to the store for a week. But it was worth every late charge. The story line is great, the characters are unique and hilarious, and the gameplay is one of the most fun I've seen in years. Don't think, just buy this game. You won't regret it."
3,"Typical quality t-shirt, nothin extraordinary about it.","I just liked that it had a front and back logo, husband says quality is just ""ok""."
1,To tell the truth by JANET DAILEY,This story is about a young woman who has been through three terrible losses in love in a very short period of time.
2,Slightly better than garbage,"Installation was easy per the instructions, that's where the good news ends. It interfered with Windows Media Player and now it won't play I get an error message that says I don't have a sound card. I'm lucky to burn 1 in 10 CD's without some kind of Hard Drive or software crash. Their technical support sends you to a web site where you have to browse for hours and try to figure out your problem. What a mistake."
4,Great Read,I liked this book becuase it had a great story line and I enjoyed the sense of humor and drama that the stroy had. Can't wait til the next one.
1,"Great, until it broke!","We make coffee frequently- twice a week or so. Not often enough to have an 18 mon old coffee maker break. Very disappointed. It had been working so well, and everyone who was in our home thought it was the coolest coffee pot! Then one day I had coffee all over my counter. :("
1,"Faulty,Cheap!",...It's stubby size makes it impossible to get out of the controller. It also has REALLY small memory size....
4,Snazzy patter & a smart cast.,"I haven't seen a lot of John Barrymore, but I liked this one. It is a obvious transplant from the stage & the camerawork isn't overly slick but it's okay for its time. The action takes place in a suite of offices that comprise a law firm located in the ""new"" Empire State Bldg.The story is timeless: An attorney on the make, lying witnesses, shady corporate deals & a hot girlfriend waiting in the wings. This isn't 2003 its 1933."
1,Never received product,I never received this product. I emailed the seller 2 weeks ago and still have not gotten a response:(
2,Enogh for now,The characters have become boring. Each episode contains much too much meaningless dialogue and too little substance. Enough of this series for now.
3,Overrated,"It's not as ""luxurious"" and amazingly soft as described. Could be softer and fluffier. Not all that bad either, just not as good as described. The fabric is not like some of those really wonderful soft cotton towels, which left me kind of disappointed. A good choice though if you're looking for average bathrobe that's not too expensive (not too cheap either). I got it for fifty dollars with shipping."
3,Be Warned: this does not work with Reflector Telescopes,"Pros:- Solid Construction, screwed right onto my t-ring with no difficulty.Cons:- Didn't work with my Celestron Starseeker 114 reflector telescope. The focal point of the camera and the focal point of the scope were nowhere near each-other.Bottom Line:Celestron makes a different model (Model # 93640) that includes a 2x barlow lens that will allow the camera to focus on the image the telescope is seeing. 3 stars, mainly because they should have either included that in the box, or removed the 'universal' moniker."
3,It works.,"I don't know much else to say... it fits on the eyepiece section. I thought I was buying the piece that attached to the back of the Celestron 4 SE telescope, but if I had read the manual instead of just doing an Amazon search I would have known this was the wrong piece. It still attached to the eyepiece though, so I don't feel like I wasted my money. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because there's no real lens, so the views that you get from looking through an eyepiece will be much bigger than with this attachment. I don't know why I thought it would work with the eyepieces. But, live and learn."
3,"GREAT product, it should be bundled with the actual camera adaptor though...","This is a great adaptor, HOWEVER it is not in my opinion a complete adaptor. I purchased this thinking that I could use it with my Nikon DSLR camera, and realized after an hour of setting up my telescope and getting it zeroed in, this does NOT attach to the camera, and you need an ADDITIONAL adaptor that fits into this one for your camera ring. These are specific to your camera so I understand that you can't sell a ""universal"" kit, but it would have been nice to know that up front."
3,Not too bad,"Once you realize that you have to put a lens inside this before you attach it to your camera, it works great! If you didn't realize that, or didn't realize that there should be directions included (Gee, there's a concept), than you would think this is a horrible investment. Now that I figured out I needed to put a lens in there before attaching it to my camera, I'm very happy!"
5,Exactly as advertised,Of course you're going to need a T-ring (specific to your camera's model) in addition to this T-adapter so that you can connect your camera to a telescope. Another really important feature is to get a counterweight kit so that your camera's weight doesn't throw off the alignment of your telescope's motor. Works fine on my Celestron Nextar 8SE.
4,mischief makers,Beware of the olympic games. Its one of the hardest obstacles in the game. Other than that this game was a real challange and had lots of variety in the playing.
1,the picture on the box is better than the animation.,"mischief makers?what does make you think of?teenagers who get bored and break stuff?firecrackers?practical jokes?pranks?how about............none of the above.how about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atari?no mischief,just a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip off.save your money a buy a box a paper clips.youll have more fun."
1,The Worst Kind of History,"I did not like this book when I read it, and I thought even less of it after I heard the author speak! In his biography---and talks---of Sherman, writer Michael Fellman commits one of the most unforgivable errors possible: Fellman judges Sherman, not by the man that he was as framed by events in the 19th century, but rather by Fellman's own, modern-day, extremely liberal views. This fact alone renders Fellman's work of highly questionable value."
5,"Integrity, Honesty, and Wisdom","Mystic Life has a way of relating to to his readers which naturally leads them to a receptive, reflective, and calm state of mind. His wisdom and insight shine light and return integrity to the understanding of what it truly means to be human AND spirtual. I find that his writings provide a clear persepective to the role of individuality while simultaneously promoting communal harmony.Thank You Mystic Life, keep shining!"
1,Interesting but Not Surprising,"Thank you for the opportunity to review this book. My first observation is that I know nothing of the credentials of the author. This is very important when dealing with (reading) such a book. Perhaps the most interesting aspect is that it confirms much of my understanding of what has and is still taking place in the Continuing Anglican Movement south of the 49th. As a priest within the Anglican Catholic Church of Canada I am aware of how much of what goes on in the U.S Church gradually enters Canada. Not all of this is good, sadly. I cringe at the description of devious and deceitful behaviour. I realize it is in Canada too and it appears to be growing. The author has done us a great service and I pray that his sincere efforts awake those who seem to be content to sleep on, regardless. Thank you Mr. Bess.The Rev'd., Fr. Richard S. Mowry, TSF(a.k.a The Rev'd., Bro. Cuthbert, TSF)"
3,wait for soething better,"As a DVD, I found this disc a great disappointment both sonically and visually. This is particularly sad as the Sydney production obviously had something special that deserved a descent recording and presentation. The picture is often soft with poor blacks. Voices are aggressive at the top and need taming whilst the orchestra has little stereo space. It may have been partially due to the original TV recording but after Image Entertainment's ham-fisted effort with Parsifal one doubts their commitment to quality mastering. I have recently seen the Glyndebourne Touring Opera perform a modern interpretation of Boheme, which I thought in many ways surpassed the Sydney production. Considering the quality of Glyndebourne DVDs, eg Le Nozze di Figaro, my recommendation would be to pass on the Sydney Boheme and wait for Glyndebourne"
1,"Terrible -- Buy ""The Complete Calligraphy Set"" instead","This set is just terrible. The box has the lie that this set includes everything you need. In fact, it contains no calligraphy ink, and the ink that is in the box is packaged in fountain pen cartridges. That there is no fountain pen in the bos makes this fact is bizare. Moreover, the text book is useless.BUY READER'S DIGEST'S ""THE COMPLETE CALLIGRAPHY SET"" INSTEAD. It is an excellent work, does have everything you need, and has much more information in the text book."
2,Missing Material......,"I was rather excited to have received this calligraphy set for Christmas but was surprised to find that I could not use it immediately. The book comes with a nice inking pen, but no pot of ink. It does come with ink cartridges but no fountain pen. It's ridiculous. The book is pretty to look at but as the other reviewer mentioned, little instruction is given on the art of calligraphy.The missing pieces of material is quite disappointing. I was really looking forward to trying my new calligraphy set.Not a good way to please your customers."
4,great game for beginners,"So many of the reviews you read on games are by ""expert"" gamers. Sometimes the very things they complain about are the things we love. This is one game that Mom, Dad, 12 year old, 7 year old and 4 year old can all play at their own level. We watch each other play and give each other tips. The scenery and music are straight out of the movie. My four year old actually went around telling people he was Tarzan. As a Mom this is just the sort of game I am looking for for my kids."
1,"Defective, this is exactly what i was afraid of","Im sorry to write a bad review, but i was so disapointed, waiting for this game to come in the mail and when it finally does , the game does not work. i tried cleaning it very carefully with a swab and alcohal, i tried restarting the station. eventually i put in another game to see if it was my nintendo. Nope my game worked perfectly. im so upset i spent the money for this game and i was sold a broken item, now i have to take time out of my schedule to print labels, package and drive somewhere to drop this off. This is bad business. You should always test the games before sending them. just cuz it looks fine does not mean it is."
2,Maybe less than 2 Stars,"Tarzan for the N64 isn't as somebody may think. It is NOT 3-D. Only some levels are in 3-D and you most of the time use the Control Pad to move Tarzan around the place. It is kind of challenging, and if you have not a controller pak, and you lose at the final levels, trust me: You will be mad. So, if you REALLY are into Tarzan get this and a Controller Pak, but action-adventure gamers like me would pass on this. It is not worth it. Tarzan:Untamed for the Gamecube is way better than this, and it is cheaper, and even that does not meet an action-gamer's expectations, so pass on this. The graphics aren't too good, the sound isn't that great, the controls are pretty hard, it is boring, it's not in 3-D, and even Yoshi's Story is much funner than this."
3,Not my favorite of Wilbur's translations,"The play is a good one. Racine manages to make a classical tragedy very real and very resonant (to 17th Century France and to us.) Many translators have tried their hand at it recently, including Ted Hughes.I'm a big fan of Richard Wilbur's translations of Moliere, so I thought I'd give this one a try. Wilbur manages to reproduce the rhyme and metrical scheme of the original, but compared to his other translations, this one is pretty dead. Where you expect high-flying rhetoric, Wilbur never modulates out of his fusty base tone. The original play is devoid of comedy, which is a shame, since Wilbur is so good at it.The bottom line is that this translation is quite readable, if not perhaps definitive. Those with access to a library might want to compare all the new translations and see which one suits them best. Fans of Wilbur are advised to stick to his Molieres."
5,Great Product!!!,Received my Lyra for Christmas and what a value. Very easy to use and I love the FM radio so I can tune in the big screen TV's at the fitness club. The extra items for the car and the arm strap were a definite plus. I did it all without reading the instructions...that tells you something right there.
2,"Complicated, hard to follow, not a great workout either","I was very disappointed with this video. I'm always so busy trying to keep up with Karen's complex coreography, poor cuing and choppy sequences, that I don't get to enjoy the workout and get decent results. By the time I finally pick up a move, she adds on to it or moves on to the next thing. She is serious, boring and not much fun to work out with."
4,Somewhat tedious but a good read overall.,"This book presents an interesting peek into the life of one family in the South around the turn of the century. It was definitely NOT a can't-put-it-down or can-hardly-wait-to-finish-it book for me, though. I found myself frequently flipping ahead to see where the story line would go, as the details became tedious and often seemed unnecessary. I am anxious to read the other two in this series, though, to see how they compare to this one."
4,Overcoming Childhood Trauma,"This is an easy-to-understand, practical guide for anyone who has suffered abuse in childhood. The book contains numerous self-help exercises which help the reader to understand and overcome the difficulties they experience now as a result of their experience in the past. The layout is user-friendly with the main points of each chapter clearly highlighted, and the chapters aren't too long so it is easier not to push oneself too hard through the book. This book has the potential to change the lives of those effected by childhood trauma, and also offers extensive references to other helpful books."
3,partial princess,"my daughter who is 21 months old is a princess fanatic, of course we had to get this book when we saw it. she loves it at bedtime but, the only flaw which is kinda a big one is that the pages are not thick enough for when she turns the pages. she had the pages bent and creased on the first night. the book could have also been a little longer. we give it 3 stars based merely on the fact that it is a disney princess book."
5,Admirer,I had the pleasure to work for Jack Real at Hughes Helicopters. He was very frustrated by all the false information that was produced about Howard Hughes.. I was very pleased to learn he would finally write this book and provide a. factual account of a amazing time..Jack lived an amazing life himself.
3,"good, but limited applications.","this camera is good for most amateur snap shots, but when it comes to sports shots, it lacks. the reason for this is that it does not allow for manual adjustment of shutter speed. this is not a very advanced skill for photographers. in fact, it is impossible to take mation shots with this camera. sure, there is a 4 shot burst mode, but that makes you take 4 shots and takes up memory. just so you know what the limitations are on this camera. also, with 4.1 megapixels, you will want to upgrade the memory card. as opposed to another review posted."
5,Excellent Product,"Light, fast, small, I liked it. And I like the fact it was the cheapest one with not standard AA batteries that run out fast."
1,"Blurry, blurry pictures","This camera, while small and easy to bring along anywhere, takes very blurry pictures at least half of the time. I've been disappointed so many times, thinking that I have some really cute pictures, only to find once I download them that they are blurry. I have to say I am very disappointed. If there is even the slightest movement, the picture is blurry. I have contacted Sony and plan on returning the camera to see if there is something they can do to fix it since it is still under warranty. Buy a different camera - especially if you have young children, as I do, and pictures are too precious to waste."
1,Pass this one up,"This was not a cheap camera. We paid over $200.00 for it, trusting the Sony name for quality. First of all the buttons are very small so if you have larger fingers, you may not like the controls. Secondly, it does not take the photos as quick as a digital of this caliber should, often photos turned out blurry. Additionally, our camera broke while still under warranty, we had to pay to have it shipped to a service center and were required to add insurance and only use UPS shipping, all of which cost over $15.00. The camera was returned to us and worked for about a month and then the same problem happened, however this time it was not under warranty and Sony would not cover the repair unless we paid $112.00 for the repair service, plus additional shipping.What a waste of money this purchase was!"
3,Approachable classic Charlie Parker,"These are really selections from Charlie Parker's Dial sessions. Two selections, Bird's Nest and Cool Blues, don't even include Mr. Davis. They're Mr. Parker with the Erroll Garner Trio. The Cool Blues selection is, in my view, a lesser effort than the master take included in the Dial sessions album. Strangely, there are no selections from the session actually dedicated to ""The Miles Davis All-Stars."" The sound quality is inferior to other CDs with the same songs. Still, the selections include most of the more approachable and listenable selections from the sessions, and therefore the CD is a good basic library item for the casual jazz fan."
2,Fine for a Double Bed,"The fabric is nice, the color looks good--they would have looked great on my queen-size bed. The package says queen, but unfortunately, they fit perfectly on the double bed in my kids' room."
2,Bad Case of Sequelitis,"Having bought the first one in this series Actiongirls.com, Vol. 1 and being somewhat impressed with it, I gave this one a go.The format from the first has remained the same: pretty girls in skimpy outfits and carrying guns take their clothes off and pose for the camera. But this one has definitely veered more into the sex part than the guns part. Don't get me wrong, I like a naked pretty girl as much as the next guy, but if I want to see a girl playing with herself, I'll just pop in a porn DVD. What I liked about the first one was equal parts sexy and violent, but this one is more like 80 / 20. I wish this one had done the same."
1,this video is terrible,"first off this video does not have many good videos and second it say's ""banned from tv"" right on the back of the box , all i want to know is for what why are these videos banned they are not uncut there is no violence and the swearing is cut out. i would not recommend buying this video at all."
4,Discovery at its best,"If you are wondering what you want to listen to from your collection, wanting to hear new undiscovered artists to you or want a great compilation of a mixture of Guitars, Jazz, New age and some blues; this album is for you.Among the musicians featured on this album are Michael Shrieve, Mick Goodrick, Jack Bruce, Davit Torn, Chad Wakerman, Trilok Gurtu and a great new band which I just discovered; Its called ""Victory of the Better Man""Recommended Album"
3,"Fun,but fast","This game was fun for about the first 5 min, then I beat it. It really was fun.You should try renting it and see if you like it"
2,Well.........,"Yoshi's Story was a big disappointment, and personally I think this game is just for kids 2-5. If you were hoping for a cool follow up of the SNES version you're in for a big surprise. The game does have some good points though, you can get Shadow Yoshi and Ghost Yoshi in some very secret areas. Also, if you get thirty melons on every level something good happens. I'm not going to tell what that is. But to have the patience to actually get all those melons is well............I won't even go there. This game probably could easily be made on SNES and no one could tell the difference. If you're set on getting this game you'll beat it in a few hours unless you've just started gaming or have small kids/siblings."
1,ok,"actually, it IS after a SNES game ""Yoshi's Island"". It is a cool SNES game, but is even worse in N64."
3,great game for young kids,"I rented this game awhile back cause it was the follow up to Yoshi's Island for the Super Nintendo and to me, it wasn't really a good follow up except in the graphics department. But kids should like it pretty good. It was just too easy to me."
2,"Good Game, needs work","The game has great graphics. The funny sounds are good too. This game is only fun for little kids. The game is good for a laugh once in a while, but this game becomes boring fast. The plot is quite (no offense to the creators) well...kinda lousy. I got it a few months after it came out and have only played it twice since then."
3,surprisingly average by Nintendo standards,"Here's the thing- Yoshi's Story is an okay game by itself, but the fact that the superior Yoshi's Island for the Super NES exists means this game is pretty much forgettable.I remember when Yoshi's Story was first released and how everyone HATED it back then. Today, time has been somewhat better to the game, but not by much. It's STILL not that great of a game.It's too easy and not complex like Yoshi's Island. THAT was a game that was really good for its time.I wouldn't dismiss Yoshi's Story, but I wouldn't rush out and buy it either."
2,Definetly a Kids game,"I purchased Yoshi's Story hoping that the Yoshi character would be more like the Yoshi of Super Nintendo fame. I thought that the levels would be a little bit challenging, but I didn't expect the game to be a little kids game. This game is definetly good for ages 0-6, but anyone that is older that plays it will probably not get much of a thrill. I only gave it a two star rating because of the enjoyment that it gave my younger brother. I got no thrill. I beat the game in a couple hours and wasn't impressed at all with it's graphics. There are SNES games with much better graphics that are much more worthwhile to get. If I had it to do over again, this game would definetly not be in my possession."
2,Painful memories,This game took far too much time of my life. As I look back I find I that all I gained was a conviction not stick with games longer then 30 min in the hopes that maybe they will get better.
2,It was fun for 2 hours,"this game is way to easy. it took me 2 hours to beat, But the 2 hours that I played the game was fun. Rent this game at most."
4,Yoshi's Story is great for Kids!,"This is a great game for small children. I was looking for something aimed at younger kids and this is perfect. My daughter has trouble with more difficult games and loses interest, but she loves Yoshi's story! I definately recommend it for younger children, but it is a bit boring for older kids and adults."
4,Cute and fun,"These Yoshis are so cute. You pick what color Yoshi you want and then go through different levels eating fruits and avoiding dangers. I thought at first all there was to it was to eat 30 fruits and the level is over, not much of a challenge, then I realized you get more points according to what you eat... and the game saves your points automatically, with your name, so my son and I competed to get the best score, both on the entire story mode and on the trial page. Every level you complete ends up as a ""sticker"" on the trial page, so you can go straight to your favorite level if you like and try to beat the best score."
3,An ok game,"I am honestly very impressed with Duck Dodgers in how well it accomplished what it set out to do. From the get go, this was supposed to be a cartoon that you finally, after all these years, were going to get to control. While I know the next generation of systems will make that even closer to reality, in Duck Dodgers we have the come as close as possible to that ideal. The music, voice samples, animations and overall Looney feel go a long way towards drawing my attention to what is otherwise an extremely average platform game.. It's definitely worth a rental because some gamers out there may not be as fond of cartoons as they'd need to be to appreciate this game. When it comes to buying this game, that's another matter. A couple evenings of hardcore gaming should get you through this game in a jiffy and the luster of playing a cartoon will wear off quickly, so owning Duck Dodgers might not be necessary"
5,The best dog toys,"The company that makes this toy and the 'cuz line is the best. My dogs (a lab and a collie/husky mix) easily tear apart all other brands except Korg but they don't seem to like the Korg toys. My lab seems to know the difference between each type of ""Ruffian"" and will prefer the chicken one day but like the bear or Bad 'Cuz on others. I wish Amazon would let the customer choose the color though. Most of the ones I've received are reddish pink and a blue one but I'd like to get some that are green and yellow but that's a minor quibble."
1,Not for chewers,"I bought this toy because my understanding was that it was designed for chewers. My 40 lb dog loved it for 2 days. On day one, the ears were chewed off and she was choking on the pieces. On day three, the squeaker no longer worked. This company made a heavy duty green bear that my dog has used for 2 months with minor damage. Disappointed this one wasn't as sturdy."
2,Watered down,"This book has no plot. It is simply written to make us fall asleep. There are some interesting tibits, but the author never goes into deatils about them. Parents: DON'T BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR KIDS. I would sugest the hawian princess one, instead."
3,good game........ but time consuming,"I think that Shadows of the Empire is a great game, but it's very time consuming. If you have a lot of time and you like star wars, i think that this is the game for you."
4,An Awesome game,This Game Can't Be Described Because It's Just To ...AWSOME!!!!!!!! These are some of the awsome things about it 1:when you die it looks real and also when you use a flamethrower the people run around screaming then they die 2: theres so many guns and you can make your on set 3:the levels and play modes are awsome and some levels have giant staoinary guns and senerty guns 4:the characters have stats and don't have to be commanded to stand gaurd or retrive the bag in capture the bag.In they end this game kicks ...
4,huh? wadaya mean?,"well, this game hasent come out yet, bet it will be a rilly good first persen shooter! almost as good as the bond games! start looking for it. if you cant find it, try looking for a serch thingie."
5,A blast from the past.,"It's just like the perfect dark graphics engine has been refine, such a great game but is an old one and in that time you'd actually need to read and explore, the game is not going to tell you what how to proceed besides the main objectives."
5,great multieplayer,"I don't own the game but my friends do.So played it alot . It has a awesome 4 player.you go around room from room killing each other. it has great modes like death mach,team death mach, capture the bag, its alot like capture the flag but with guns so it has to be fun. here are some pros and consprosbest 4 player game I played in a whilegood graphicsgood/awesome gunsconsscary story modethat's about it for consso to sum it up I will give it 9 out of a possible 10"
4,Still fun in 2009,This game for its time had a lot going for it and its still fun to play years later. When I got this game I played it quite a bit. Beat the single player and it was fun. Some friends came over so we tried out the multi player and it was a blast. I think the greatest thing about this game is the fact your not in just one typical setting instead you move around in time. Also take note but I am not 100% but I think the people that made this might have worked on Perfect Dark or Goldeneye as the death match is much the same but I am not 100 % if its the same team of developers. Over all out of last generation this is probably one of the best FPS to come out and especially for the Gamecube. There is a lot to unlock and plenty of characters for multi. I think the single greatest aspect of this game is in multi player getting the monkey its simply awesome!
3,Good Idea.. Bad Build,"Looks Great WARNING do not put pressure on the plastic dual port covers (the aluminum sides) they will break internally and you will be stuck with a rattle Also like someone else stated the terminals come with 18 Guage wire (possibly smaller) which Blew 4 subs until I finally reALized that, that was the problem.. Oh also GET RID OF THE SUBS that COME WITH THE UNIT unless you want to run [200 Watts (rms) 100 each ONLY] all in all SUPER knock! with right sUbS and a few adjustments, and it Obviouslyyyy looksssss gooood."
4,Cool Game.,"yeah it's good, i'd buy it again if i had a choice. i love the game, makes my eyes hurt tho...but i think its from me playing it to long....its great"
3,Not always practical,"Nancy made some good points in her book, but she doesn't seem to be totally in touch with the real world. Some of us can't afford to go to doctor after doctor, we have rules placed on us by our insurance companies. I got some good points out of the book, but it has not become my go to ms book."
1,Disappointing,"Barely got through the whole thing. Normally like Hill, but this one just didn't cut it."
3,"Southern Comfort, my review from Barcelona","Really I heard severaol times this CD SOUTHERN COMFORT as well as the other two I have (TAKIN' IT EASY and TROUBLE), my opinion is that this CD SOUTHERN COMFORT is that containing more pure BLUES than the other, which have some very good compositions but rather ""soft"" with respect to the CHICAGO BLUES that preaches.She has a sesacional voice, you can notice the KOKO Taylor'S influence ""THE QUEEN of the Blues"" in his tone of voice, but my overall impression is that, these CD's no need for the chorus (too much gospel and R & B flavor often) and the Blues she plays in general, unless some composition is elemental,nothing new except a great performance, I do not get excited as other topics of Blues. However my assessment is good and I scored as 3.5 stars.The same score I give the other two CD's that I've referenced in this review."
1,Bad Customer Service,Big delay in receipt of product. Ordered one week before I needed it and it didn't ship for several days after. Received several days late - this was a birthday gift. Big disappointment and slow response time when I tried to get answers.
1,"This story is explained ""horror-bly""!","They attempt to tell a story which has so many holes and missing parts to it, that it ruined the entire movie for me. I won't go into the story since it was actually explained alot better in a few sentences in the reviews above then it was in an hour and a half movie. Also the acting was bad, make-up was bad, the sets were bad and the sub-plot with Demons at the end made it worse. A low-budget movie that you couln't even laugh at, now Flesheater was a low-budget movie I laughed at, for example. Not worth your time, but when you have mixed reviews (the reason why I had to see it), I understand if you do.The best part is the nudity, of course featuring full frontal of porn star Ruby Larocca."
2,"Awful, but good for laughs.","It was terrible. The blood looked like Kool-Aid, the voice acting was terrible, bad actors, with an overweight porn star on it who coulden't keep her clothes on. You could sometimes hear the motor from the camera and it was just an overall bad movie. I couldn't help but laugh about how cheesy and poorly made it was though."
4,Stitch and Sleuth,"One of my favorites so far in the Betsey Devonshire 'Needlecraft Mystery' series. Great characters, good plot development & story.Everything the 'Publishers Weekly' review states is true.I love the historical aspects in this volume."
4,Much better than the others in the series,"I had given up on this series and only picked up this title because I was standing in the library and thought 'why not?' There was (for my taste)too much too much of the same old characters sitting and stitching and talking. Instead of suffering from a lack of the regulars (Betsy in particular), this entry in the series is improved by the regulars taking a back seat. I don't know if the author realized the necessity for a change in the direction of this particular series, but it certainly improved it for this reader!"
2,Questionable,"The songs on this album are great. However, I wasn't prepared for the fact that when it says non-stop, it literally means non-stop. The songs run on together. Some of the songs are not the complete versions. I was disappointed. It is good for dancing, but not if you want to listen to the songs individually."
3,A Nature Lover's review,"Ok to be clear, I'm a vegetarian, Zia cosmetics user, and I try to use the most natural products in general.That said, I was not impressed with this product. It didn't hurt my skin, I have a sensitive/acne-prone complexion, but it didn't smooth/soften my face either.Also the texture was like Crisco imo, hard to spread, tacky feeling.I would not recommend it, but I will say Amazon has the best price I've seen (I'd have been ticked if I paid retail), so it couldn't ""hurt"" to give it a try. If you'd like a gentle/effective exfoliator from a natural source, try the Ultimate Exfoliant. It's a little more, but it really does work, though I did build up a tolerance (not in a good way) to it after awhile."
5,"If you like the spirit of the old west, this is it!","A friend gave me this CD when we moved from Santa Fe, NM to Coeur d' Alene, ID last December. It saved my mind on the long drive north and I've purchased the rest of the Don Edwards' collection because of that. Guess it's just the old coyotes and me left to really enjoy the ""original"" Don that this record represents."
1,rip off,Perfect dark is a total rip off of james bond and has the same ideas for levels and it sucks james bond was way better
4,perfect dark,"a fun mutli-player game. the singles missions aren't that great, but the multi-player options definitely make this game worth owning."
4,"Good, but easily could have been better.","I have played Nintendo games since the realease of the original system in 1986 so it takes a lot to impress me. Being one of, if not the premier gamer in the state of North Carolina, I found the story of Perfect Dark just a bit cheesy. It almost seemed that Nintendo wanted to put a child-like storyline to a game in which the characters curse and die screaming. In fact, the sounds of characters who have just been shot are the best parts of this game. The whole alien storyline was just a bit much don't you think? Then you went on to call him Elvis! Elvis of all things. Oh well, if you like a good shoot-em up buy this game, if you don't, this game will not change your mind. Good attempt, but you still can't surpass the excellency and precision of Goldeneye."
5,Best Game Ever?.......Ahhhh YEAH!,"Makers of Goldeneye, over 40 weapons, awesome multiplayer action, incredible story, great graphics, fantastic gameplay, expansion pack enhanced, its been in the making for many years and these guys arn't playing around. I'm telling you right now if you don't allready have a N64, get one, if you don't have an expansion pak, get one, and if you don't have this game on reserve, do it now!"
3,Try getting a PS2!,"All the reveiws I have seen so far, say that this game is perfect. It's not. As I said, try getting a PS2, then get: GoldenEye: Rogue Agent. Oh, yeah, I've never had this game!!!"
3,A Game that doesn't live up to Goldeneye,It Might sound better than 007 but it is not.The game is good but not great.So if you have 007 no need to buy this game except for it's great multiplayer.
2,THIS GAME IS NOT GOLDENEYE,"Well ladies and gentlemen. A new and supposedly incredible game is out there. Perfect Dark. I bought this for my little brother and thought he would play it constantly. I played with him and noticed the graphics are much worse than those of goldeneye and the story line is corny. The missions are somewhat fun but farfetched and the gameplay just doesnt match goldeneye. This game had all the elements to be incredible, it is just missing something. It didnt pull together as well as goldeneye did. The simulant option is incredible and there are trillions of game modes, but until the new bond game, i remain with 007."
5,This Game is Awsome!,"This is the best first person shooter game I have ever played. It has great weapons that have first and secondary modes. The combat simulator is the best multiplayer I have seen. I got this game last year and I still play it. Once you beat all of the levels on agent and special agent you get special assignments like Maian SOS, Mr Blonde's Revenge, and The Duel. This is a must buy for any gamer."
5,Golden eye is a peace of shit,Perfect dark toatly whoops golden eyes ass i mean the graphics are incredible the game its self is toatly awsome like combat simulator mode is way cool .. I highly recomand this game get it today at gamestop. Have fun
5,Thorough,"As a Medium I began using this dictionary myself for a reference years ago. Today I've recommended it to clients who wish to define their own dreams, or who are 'seeing' themselves and need a tool. It is well-organized and thorough. [...]"
3,Metza metza,"I'd call this resource something like 60% useful. But then, how can any one volume comprehensively cover all possible dream content? It's useful/helpful when it is, and it's not at all when it's not (i.e., when the dream element is not even listed)."

5,Five stars for Follow Your Stars,"Met the author at a convention a few weeks ago and spoke with her about her book, the character of Hopalong Cassidy and the actor, William Boyd. Her stories are a fitting tribute to that Western icon."
2,melts under pressure,"I've had this machine for a few years but just recenlty decided to make a big batch of popcorn-enough for 6 of us. Well...it turned off, blew unpopped kernals everywhere, burnt some of the popcorn, then shut down. It can not handle multiple batches at a time. It's more like a child's toy. For serious popcorn, buy a much better one. Then I discovered that the top had melted and I couldn't put one of the pieces back together so I just threw it out. I'm looking at buying the Waring Pro for about 139.00. For a novelty, used once in awhile, it's ok. But if you have a home theater and want to actually use it, then look elsewhere. Also it is purely airpopped so the taste is not so great, unless you melt the butter and pour it over the top."
5,Excellent Reference for drawing animals,This is an excellent reference for drawing animals. If I was only going to get one book on drawing animals.... this would be the one I would want!
3,interesting traditional style,"This book is now out of print which is unfortunate as Dr. Miriam Lee's clinical stories are very interesting. The material in this book, however, was not sufficient to learn how to practice Master Tung's acupuncture. Purchase Dr. Young's books which are much better clinically and do not bother spending hundreds of dollars acquiring this out of print book."
1,Going Back to Printmaster 8.0,"I have tried three times to install this product and the installation always seems to work, but when you click on the ICON to use the product, nothing happens. Broderbund does not offer a toll free number for customer support and does not offer a website that I can find, that you can search for an answer. My computer has plenty of RAM and hard drive space. RAM could be a problem on some peoples computer, as the software requires 64MB RAM. Looks like I am going to be out about .... Have never sent anything back to Amazon or Broderbund. Could me more hassle than it is worth. Hopefully others will have better luck. I will reinstall version 8.0."
2,"Too Much Hype, Less Action!!!","I'm an Avenger fanatic and like a little bit of X-Men too which maybe the reason why I bought the Ultimate War #1 and later the TPB. I was disappointed by this series - too much word balloons killed the excitement of the probable confrontation of the Ultimate X-Men and Ultimates (Avenger). Unlike the Authority-series and Ultimates, Mark Millar failed in this one!!!"
1,"Biased ""History""","This is not history, but rather a very biased revision of filtered facts and a great deal of creativity. While Mr. Hogeland has a very entertaining and fluid writing style, his facts are filtered to reflect his personal bias against Hamilton, Morris and even George Washington. The dialogue is more ""screen-play"" than history. It is a shame, since this is a fascinating and under-appreciated period of our nation's history. The author presumes motive, and draws conclusions about Alexander Hamilton and President Washington that are unsupported by research. He often manipulates the story to support his presumptions. The uninformed will be misled, and the well versed in this history will be disappointed, if not angered. It would be best to leave this one on the shelf."
5,"Sex, crime, and rock-n-roll!","Sex, crime, and rock-n-roll! It's all here in this brilliant novel by Rob Roberge. We are gladly taken on a fast-paced, twisted ride down into the depths of societies' seedier side where everyone has a story they don't want told and allegiances depends on the quickest buck possible. Roberge captures this world with fearless honesty and addictive prose. And it's really damn funny to boot. Extremely highly recommended!"
3,Worth the Price Just for Lani Todd,This is an average video. You would think putting some of Playboy's better playmates in bed would be a bit more inviting. But the video is worth buying just for the scenes with Lani Todd.
3,Got me sleepy,"I originally bought this DVD ""for a friend""...since he didn't want it, I viewed it. It is a typical Playboy production, which is to say an overblown but beautiful production, high standards for the sets, the actresses, etc. Over all, though, you feel like it is definitely a stage movie or more a fashion shoot. The passion? None. It is true: however beautiful the actress, if she is just a stage prop, with no emotional ties, then there is no emotion in the viewer either."
1,Just better than nothing,Just received my copy today. Have not had time to watch it yet but thought others might like to know what is actually on the DVDs. There appear to be thirteen episodes from the entire run. Not exactly what I was looking for but just a bit better than nothing.Update 16 October 2008.Quite disapointing actually. Just a hodge podge of episodes. It's fine for someone who wants to see if they would like to put out the money for a full season sets but it should be priced much lower. It should have been a full season release. And there is only one episode where they go after DR DICK.Disc one:The last temptation of CybillLocal HeroEducating ZoeyPal ZoeyBringing home the baconCybill does diaryKiss me you foolWhere's a harpoon when you need one?Show me the MinnieKa-BoomDisc 2:2008 interview with Cybill ShepherdHer favorite episodes:Going to Hell in a limo (part 1)Valentine's DayThe golden years
3,Details Please,"While it is great that this show is coming to DVD, it would nice to get some details. Such as how many episodes.The best-of could be one episode or the whole series.I want details before I order.I hope it has the Las Vegas episode. (It takes two...)"
5,Wonderful....wher's the rest?,This stands as one of the best written/best performed comedy series ever....super cast....where are the rest of the years? I'll buy every year.
2,So disappointed!,"Like so many others reviewing this DVD, I absolutely loved the TV show and hunted for recordings of it. What is so disappointing is that this DVD is a collection of shows and not the series from the beginning. Some Cybill and MaryAnn is better than none, but how releasing all of the episodes from beginning to end?"
2,GLASS,I THOUGHT WHEN I BOUGHT IT IT WAS ABOUT SEAGLASS I SURE IT WOULD BE OKAY FOR PROJECTS ON GLASS
2,Broke already,Worked great on the first cleat I removed but on the second one it broke. I admit the cleat was tight and I used a lot of force but I didn't expect one of the pins that goes into the cleat to break off. I'll stick with using a pair of needle nose pliers.
1,Garbage,"Junk. Plugged it into my cleat, and within five seconds the pin broke. Spend your money on something that has at least a few ounces of quality in it."
5,"Come back, Gary!","Gary Larsen has to be the sickest, funniest guy on the planet! His parents must be just as sick as they raised him because, as a boy, they encouraged him to grow snakes, lizards, etc. in the basement of their home --- after he was allowed to flood it! (True story, according to a fingernail sketch of the guy which I read many years ago!) But back to his cartoons --- hysterically funny, droll, ridiculous and wonderful! His skewed view of our world is a delight, his drawings are as crazy (and wonderful) as he is and this universe will be a sadder, saner place without his wit and irony. Although he's been gone from the daily comic section of the country's newspapers for years already, I always held out the hope that he would return. If, indeed, this is his LAST calendar collection, you MUST order it and treasure it. DO NOT TEAR OFF THE PAGES AND TOSS THEM as I have been carelessly doing this past year. We will never see the likes of Gary Larsen again in our lifetimes!"
3,"Very good, but not very portable","This is a very good dependable unit. It does a lot of things for a very small unit. My only complaint is that it is sold as a portable and it is not. It will only run on AC power, which means it must be plugged into the wall. The only thing portable about it is that it has a handle. If this unit had the ability to operate on DC power too, then it would be perfect."
5,"Great service, great product","The lava lamps were just what I wanted and so affordable. Best of all, the provider (Creative Motion Industries) immediately contacted me with questions about my order and got it in the mail fast - all the way to Kodiak Island, Alaska!"
3,Nostagia Reigns!,"Some of the songs - Arches, Umberella Man, Siegfried Line gave me a touch of the nostalgias. The rest were pretty hows-your-father. Worth buying just for the few good'uns, though!"
1,It's A Terrible Bullrider Movie,"I Would Not Buy This DVD Because It Only Has The History Of Bullriders Getting The Ride Of Their Life. Yes, Bullriding Is A Dangerous SportAnd That's Exactly How Lane Frost Was Killed Riding A Bull Back In 1989.Tuff Hedeman Was Also A Great Bullrider And Played His Role As A Professional Bullrider In The PBR.I Think This DVD Is Stupid!Interested In A Cowboy Movie Buy Or Rent:Cowboy Up"
3,Enjoyable series,Enjoyable series wth an excellent lead actor. I felt it was pricey for only four disks. It was over too quickly
1,Baleful capitalist propaganda,"This book displays the same sorry imperialist logic that got (so-called) Third World countries into debt in the first place. When milions of people are dying from starvation in the real world, it is irritating to listen to tired self-justifying academic rubbish."
1,Economics......the root of all evil in the modern world,Ive read this book and I can tell you it stinks.....unless you are a soulless capitalist bent on world anihilation and conquest......an overview of everything that is wrong with the human race......
3,I heard of a glove for NES but not for 64,I want one of these things. I never have used a glove before. If you wacth 'The Wizard' it is a Nes movie. I been wondering if this thing is in stores yet?
1,?????,I've been waiting for this to come in stock for several months now. This is getting really annoying. I found out about this p[roduct Christmas 2000 and have been checking back here regularly to see if it has come in yet. If anybody knows when it will be in stock please let me know.
4,Pretty good,"Great DOOM game, a new look at the classic shooter with lots of new suprizes. The new set of levels are cool, the monsters are great as always with cool new looks, there are great new effects that add to the creepiness of the greatest shooting series ever such as fog. The new weapons like the double chainsaw are great, the music is very good, which always shines in doom games and over all very well done."
1,Huh?,I've played this game and it's PC version. This one stunk if I were you get Duke Nukem 3d or wait until the new Duke Nukem comes out. The best one of all is Quake. Get one of those games. The PC version of Doom is better but by half a star. If you are looking for a female action hero get Tomb Raider or Perfect Dark. Don't even waste your time with this stupid Pixilated game.
1,Never worked,We bought this for a 3rd birthday present for our friend's little boy. It didn't work at all and was such a huge dissapointment.
2,Horrid,"""This thing stinks...""Im running XP Pro. Picked this cam up for 80 bucks and installed an OEM USB 2.0 card. Ran ok for a few minutes then had 2 complete system lockups with blue screen. Had to re-boot both times. Sent e-mail to Orange Micro tech support with no reply. Called tech support, on my long distance dime, and was on hold for over 30 minutes before a secretary took my name and number and ""would have a tech call me"".Still waiting. Horrible Drivers for XP and some of the worst tech support I have ever seen. AVOID this trash..smoke signals are better....these guys are fools.. Hey, Orange Micro....ever heard of TESTING a product before you sell it??????"
4,good but the video is poor,"This is a long opera and a good performance. Satan was especially convincing. The poor quality, very poor quality, of the video is a shame, as the rest of the product is fine."
5,Totaly Awesome!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is Action Pacted with A whole lot of Action and gore, this game sucks you in and you can't get out ,that how adictingthis game is. The way that I got adicted to this game partly is the trouble of trying to buy it, when I was looking for it I saw it for 100$ dollars to 250$ dollars!So the only way that you know you like it is if its hard to get it but you keep trying!!!!"
1,STARCRAFT 64 IS HORRIBLE.,"I don't know why they even bother remaking StarCraft for the N64. I mean, StarCraft 64 has to be the lamest remake of any PC game ever! The graphics are horrible. All the units are so small, it takes the fun out. The graphics is fuzzy and has lots of specs, even with an expansion pak!! You can't go online with this game, so you can't meet other people to compete with. Other than that, StarCraft is a good game, but ONLY for the PC. It requires a lot of stratergy."
5,Need a Good Belly Laugh?,"This book is just hilarious! The mildly seasoned scrapbooker with even a hint of a sense of humor will find themselves bursting out laughing at any moment-I sometimes read a chapter in the middle of the night if I am having trouble sleeping and have been quite worried I might awaken the entire household with my laughter! This book sounds just like something my sister-in-law would write, so I often hear her voice reading it to me :-) Yes, at one point the author even refers to the reader as ""Missy"" just as she does with me on occasion! I have never met Wendy Bagley, but if she has a tiny bit stage presence, I think she would be a great stand up comedian at one of those big nationally sponsored Crops. So, yes, be sure you buy this book for yourself and any other scrapbookers you know who might benefit from a good belly laugh."
3,Disappointed,"The music is great, don't get me wrong. I love J-Lo, but I ordered this CD under the the pretenses that there were 16 songs on the album. The cd cover lists 16 songs, the insert has 16 songs my cd only had 11!..."
2,She can't actually sing,"ive heard all her released material and it isn't all that much like people say she is.the remixes are not that great, but the best one that stands out is Waiting for Tonight..that song in my opinion is the best one she's ever released to date and the remix is actually the best one ive heard by many artists...and that new song ALIVE...is a nice song and the lyrics are sweet..but her voice doesn't do the song any justice..she tries to hit notes her voice can't even reach..she should stick to her more hip/hop sound where voice isn't such a big deal..."
1,DON'T BUY! COPY-PROTECTED! WON'T WORK IN COMPUTER!,"TITLEMac OS: Cannot Eject Copy Protected Audio Disc, Computer Starts Up to Gray Screen5/9/02TOPICYou may be unable to eject certain copy-protected audio discs, which resemble Compact Discs (CD) but technically are not. Some computers start up to a gray screen after a copy protected disc has been left in the computer.DISCUSSIONSymptom1. You insert an audio disc, which is not recognized by the computer.2. The audio disc will not eject.3. The computer starts up to a gray screen when the disc is in the optical drive.Products affected*Any Macintosh computer with an optical drive capable of accepting CD-ROM audio discs.The following discs are known to use the copy protection:** Shakira: ""Laundry Service""* Jennifer Lopez: ""J To Tha L-O!""Celine Dion: ""A New Day Has Come""Note: Other discs may be affected as well. Apple is aware of record companies, including but not limited to Sony, that use such copy protection in new CD audio releases."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"Okay. Usually when someone comes out with a REMIX album, the remixes tend to slide more on the club/dance side of things, which is actually what I was expecting when I bought it. Well, I'M an idiot! There are only 2--no, 3(if you include ""Let's Get Loud"")club-friendly remixes on this album, and they really are not all that long(most club mixes go mostly anywhere from 6:00 to 11:00). Also, what's the point in having the ""I'm Real"" remix after she went through all that trouble to re-release J-LO with that on there. C'mon J.Lo. Next time you come out with a remix album, make it a REAL(by real I mean more club oriented) remix album!"
1,"Ugly, Overrated Lopez Fails Again","This CD is horrible. Lopez has an awful voice and the rap special guests aren't the cream of the crop either. As a side note, Jennifer Lopez has an extremely ugly face. Don't buy this CD. Save your money and buy Bone Thugs n Harmony discs."
4,Very well done remix album!,"Jennifer Lopez's remix album is surprisingly good. I liked most of these songs better than the album versions. I remembered hearing the Rodney Jerkins remix of If You Had My Love on the radio during the time the other stations played the regular version. It sounded funky and had more kick to it! There's more of a hip-hop feel on this one, especially the funky Ain't It Funny, the attitude driven I'm Real, the aggressive Love Don't Cost a Thing and others. I also like the Mark Taylor/Brian Rawlings Metro Mix of Walking on Sunshine and their trademark rumbling echoing keyboards. Let's Get Loud also is good. And I definitely like the walking in a lost tropical forest feel of the Waiting For Tonight remix! The closing, quiet mood of Alive is nice and one of her better ballads. This album is better than most remix albums for that they match with J-Lo's style and make the uneven songwriting on the songs a little more clearer."
5,"""THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE TOOL.""","THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG TEXTBOOK IN THE FIELD OF BLACK CULTURE. IT IS SIMPLE AND CONCISE, YET COMPREHENSIVE IN ITS COVERAGE OF THE EXTANT RESERACH ON THE SUBJECT. THE ORGANIZATION AND STYLE OF THE BOOK MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY FOR CULTURE AWARENESS AND AN EXCELLENT TEACHING TOOL."
1,Why?,Why is this the focus? We need to focus on all kids not just one race. Kids don't learn the way its been done in the past. They need to be engaged with technology and the dropout rate will go down!
5,absolutley flawless,"I just bought this as a replacement for my Toshiba that was a few years older. I bought this mainly because I just got a 36in HDTV widescreen and wanted good progressive scan capabilities and optical sound output to my new receiver. This DVD is fantastic I have yet to experience any of the problems I read about, the anamorphic conversion is great, the letterbox edges are crisp and smooth the picture is wonderfull. The numerous jacks make it possible to get this up and running on any system but if you have the choice use the optical sound because it is amazing."
3,dreaming in the 60s...of that soul sound(dig it man.),"remember back in the 1960s when a garage band could record their own song on a reel to reel tape,give it to a radio station, and then (maybe) get famous??? this is sort of what this story""soul city downstairs"" is about. this is a group of teenagers brought together by another teen named,""stats"". stats knows all these kids and IS SURE they could form a band together and make it big time!!! does it happen for:paul,hoke,jonah,jersey,and stats? ? ? ?wellllll,let's just say,stats has alot of ""BIG"" ideas that never seem to work out. he gets an A+ for trying.the characters were ok. they were typical teenage dreamers who were easily emotional or easily distracted.i think the author wanted to convey the theory of not giving up no matter how bad it looks-keep trying."
2,of course its impossible,"this game is simply just a chess game.i know.youre thinking BORING!however,this one has a added attraction.whenever you kill an enemy,a little cartoon of the kill plays.they are pretty funny.well,they WERE the last 6-8 million plus times i saw them.now theyre obnoxious.play youre friends because the computer on level one of the easiest level was programmed at near genius level.youd need a iq of like 135 to beat it."
2,Cheap quality,The retractable works but doesn't extend as much as I would like. It also looks cheap but it saves all the frustration from untangling that long earphone.
4,"Fans Won't Need The ""Best-Of"" Disk","The problem with the ""Best of Season One"" DVD is that the majority--if not most--of the fans of the show have already bought the complete Season One DVD set. They won't need the ""Best-Of"" disk. So then, when the ""Best-Of"" disk doesn't do much business, Fox can say, ""See, there's not much interest,"" and use it as an excuse not to release Season Two. A much better test would be a Best of Season TWO disk."
4,It helped me to see this first!!,"I hadn't seen the Mary Tyler Moore show in years so I bought this starter set with it's expired coupon at Walmart, watched the 4 shows (liked it) then bought the first 2 seasons here on Amazon. When seasons 3 & 4 came out I also bought those from Amazon. Sadly due to low customer demand for this series the rest of the seasons have not been released as of this writing. If they wrere I would have bought them.The starter sets are a great idea if you don't remember a series that well & want to see if you like it before buying any seasons."
2,"Bland lyrics - been there, done that","Well I hate to bring a below-average review because I love Third Day. ""Wire"" and ""Wherever You Are"" are lyrically bland at best. The music isn't too exceptional either. The lyrics are very ""CCM-like"". In other words, I found little depth to the lyrics. I guess I'm in a different place spiritually? Got me!Anyways, if you like the self-titled album or ""Time"", then you probably won't like either of these albums too much. I guess I just expected more when I shouldn't have.One stand-out track: ""Cry Out To Jesus"" - this is the LONE EXCEPTION to what I have written in this review. The lyrics are especially meaningful in this song."
5,Absolutely Loved It!,"I am a huge fan of the original nutcracker and still fell in love with this version. It is very different, but very entertaining, mystical and magical. I caught it on cable and now I am ordering it. I can understand some of the negative reviews if you have no imagination at all. And as one reviewer mentioned, it is NOT rated G, so parents should be viewing this before their children to see if it's something they would want them to see. I loved it, it is almost along the lines of labyrinth or baron von munchausen. You definately have to be a fan of fantasy, and fantasy is always dark at some point...the witch in snow white etc. She scared the heck out of me, and still does today, but no one complains about her!"
3,"Great, but hard to line up on the keyboard",This is a great toy and my DD has loved playing with this since she was 7 months old. Great toy for teaching cause and effect. The one catch is that it is very difficult to get the toy to line up right with your computer keyboard. You can still play with it when it is not lined up but it is more difficult to get the cause and effect concept down since it doesn't do what she expects when she pushes certain keys. At 15 months she still loves this toy.
4,BOMBERMANS KEPT HIS BLOW FOR TEN YEARS!!!!!!,"Yes, its me, bombermans biggest fan again, for more reports on bomberman! This one is not as good as the other ones but it is in three dimensional contact. However, the thing that can drive you to the terrifying demise of a psycopath, is the one hit K.O.'s! I care about bomberman's heath matinence so much that I set this down for awhile! And The Bosses are uncouth and are so tough you may want to hire prophets of doom to march around your house the whole time you play the boss!So this game still is fun but dont exepect as much from it as other bombermans!"
1,Absolutly retarded,"This game is so stupid, i don't understand why people like it. There is no real fun in it. For one thing you can't jump/ wich is dumb. and the attack moves are really duel. it sucks! do not buy this game.If by any chance you liked this game then check out all of the other Bomberman games."
2,"Handy, but poor design and anemic sound","I purchased this item recently. It arrived very quickly, and it is convenient that the chimes do not require a separate stand. However, you have to hang the chimes yourself, using supplied plastic ties. The ties are not tight and it is possible for the chimes to shift a bit horizontally, so they may not sit very evenly. Also, the aluminum used in this set gives a quite thin sound, much more like cheap windchimes than something deserving of the word instrument. I'd have to recommend looking for a nicer unit if you plan to do any real performing or recording."
4,Lex,"Good quality music... The singer has a great voice - looks like he had really professional training before, and the band has brains - not a bad combination. I'd give Axxis 4.5 points."
4,Entertaining and informative,I found the book very informative and the attached CD a good accompaniment. My only detractor is the CD has to be used to run the program.
4,keeps contents hot,I do like this product; my only criticism is that the top is hard to put on and take off for one with arthritis as I have. But it does keep the contents hot and is very nice looking.
2,Broiler function doesn't work,"Too late to return for a full refund I learn that the broiler function doesn't work.The top and bottom elements work but when I set it to broil, only the bottom element comes on.I like this oven otherwise. It's simple, compact size but huge inside make it very handy. Just wish the quality was a bit more reliable."
1,Didn't work for long...,"We ordered this oven because it's so hard to find an all-black oven. While it looked great on our counters, its toaster function broke within a couple of months. After that it never heated evenly. It had a tendency to burn food within minutes and the next time we used it food would take forever to cook. We ended up replacing it."
1,Poor,"This game lacks in graphics, game plot, and game time. (How long it is). When I bought this I expected a great game, but got nothing."
3,"Nice, if somewhat derivative, modern pulp ideas","This rules supplement gives various alien races, monsters and organizations for a modern pulp game.Few of the ideas are very original, there's an even corporation, an evil government conspiracy, an evil drug cartel and other standard choices. But it's solid and gives GMs a lot to work with."
3,"""Eye"" liked it, but didn't love it!","Here's what I did like about Ecco Bella. It wasn't goopy like a lot of mascara can be. It didn't clot or cause my lashes to clump. It went on smoothly and I could hardly tell it was there. It came off as easily as it went on.On the other hand, I didn't feel like it made my lashes feel or look longer or nicer.It's a simple straightforward product that I would wear as an everyday mascara but I would use it in combination with others if I was attempting to achieve a ""sexy eyes"" look.I love the fact that it's organic and natural and for these reasons alone I would recommend it for everyday use."
3,Just Ok,"I switched to all natural makeup after becoming pregnant. I admit to using the super-charged, definitely-not-natural stuff previously, so perhaps I not the best judge. The mascara itself is very wet and if I'm not very careful in applying it, my lashes can go a little Tammy Fay. It wears off quickly too. There's really no lengthening power to it (which the product doesn't claim), so you really are getting a lash paint of sorts."
5,Great,I received the item and it was shipped to me very quickly. The item was just as described. Thanks to all.
3,Not bad,"Not a bad item nothing amazing but it is nice to have a brown mascara that is ecco friendly. The mirror attached to the body was nice too, I'd say that was probably the best thing about this product as far a useablity and quality. It is also water resistant which as someone with sensitive eyes like me, is a must.We are only talking about mascara here so you really can't be too excited or gushing about such an item. But it was a good item something I may buy when I finish the first bottle."
2,My experience with it,"I bought some in brown and it looked nice on my naturally blonde eyelashes BUT.....it irritated my eyelids.I noticed the irritation after the first application and wearing it for the day. I then tried again a few days later.Both days, my lids, near where the lashes grow out were feeling allergic.Had to pitch the stuff in the trash and go back to Maybelline.Fiddlesticks."
2,Not at all man.,This game is to dark to see anything and hard to play with the controls provided. I'd recommend upgrading to a different system for this game.
3,a okay game,"this game was okay, not what i really like but it was fun. if you like shooting games then this one is for you."
3,Above average for its genre,"This at first seemed to be a lot like Saw, but it went beyond that and into the realm of chance and the roll of the dice. The acting and music were far better than what one would normally expect from this type of film too."
3,another great product by kool-tek,"great grip, exellent heat repellent, just i prefer the 15 inch as it protects even more of your arm when reaching back into the oven."
4,Cost benefit analysis necessary,"This is a fantastic oven mitt (even the 12-inch version). If the price were $25, it would definitely be worth 5 stars. However, I'm not sure the product warrants the current price. It's a great glove, but not 7 times as great as the competition's."
2,So disappointing...,"I waited a long time to buy these oven mitts because of the high price. They had been on my wishlist for a while because of the great rating they got on Cook's Illustrated. I finally broke down and bought them after my cheapie ones got a hole burned in them. They look nice and are very heat resistant but the darn things don't stay on my hands. I have big hands for a woman and these kept falling off and getting into my food I was trying to pull out of the oven. I am so disappointed, I really wanted to like these. Unfortunately, I just put in my return request and am getting my money back. Luckily Amazon makes returns easy."
4,Just one Small Problem,Great mitt but I have one caveat.The part covering you arm is too small.Arms in Connecticut.
5,Organize Homework!,"As a teacher, keeping things simple is key to efficiently using my valuable time. This is a wonderful tool for managing our homework, morning check in, and does so with a quick visual check. In fact, it's invaluable!This station arrives with plastic coated, easy to use labels that fit neatly into the clear pouch. Pockets are deep enough for full sheets without being so deep that 1/2 sheets get lost. Five ""hangy holes"" (yes, it's a technical term) allow for full support which is critical when 27 students are turning in an entire unit of work!Buy it, use it, and you will be happy. I've added clothes pins to mine. One side is red (hot lunch), the other blue (cold), and in an instant attendance and hot lunch count is done! Now, if only I could purchase an additional column for my class as it GROWS."
4,useful,"I use this as mailboxes for my students in class. It is ripping a little at some of the seams, but I have had it for a couple of years."
1,Aggrivating & limited,"I bought this game based on its good reviews in the game magazines. But I was deeply disappointed. The colors are washed out, making it difficult to actually _see_ the water on the board. The 3-d gameplay is vague. It is difficult to figure out where the the piece is as it is falling. The walls are lumpy, indistinct hills, further confusing things.All of these combine to produce a game that makes it impossible to play very deliberately - frustrating in a puzzle game."
3,A must for any BASIC programmer interested in CGI,"First, I should note that using Visual Basic for a web server application is pathetic. Each instance of the application requires a minimum of 4 megs of RAM, so using it on a high-traffic site is suicidal.That said, the book and the code in the book are very good. Ported to C, Delphi or especially PowerBASIC, you can't go wrong. The book also does a fairly good job of covering the CGI spec.My suggestion, buy the book and go get yourself a copy of PowerBASIC so that you can create true CGI apps that take only a few K instead of megabytes."
3,PAJAM should stick to jams...,"I ordered this based on a review that I had read. Needless to say I was somewhat disappointed in the results. As we all know, PAJAM is a ""hit-maker"". Almost anything they touch turns to gold. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work in the Praise & Worship genre. I didn't like some of the musical/vocal arrangements of the songs. If you're going to re-do a song for praise and worship that is well-known, it is important to keep the basic melody of the song. Some songs were completely unrecognizable in a bad sense.PAJAM, stick to what you do best, R&P;, and leave P&W; to those who do it best."
2,Under-delivers,"This video could have been one of the best. Indeed, the premise is quite plausible-having the first year's batch of Cyber Girls of the Month making the leap from computer to celluloid. Having said that, this reviewer can not help but be disappointed. Specifically, only four of the twelve CGOMs are given the full feature treatment - photo shoot, face-to-face self-introduction, then video showcase. It is not clear why the Other Eight [one of whom happens to be the Cyber Girl of the Year] are given the ""short shrift"" for lack of a better term. Most likely, the producer[s] did not wish to make a 75-85 minute presentation. Also, maybe the mediocre calibre of this first outing helps explain why there are no CGOM compilations for the following years [this title only covers January-December 2001]."
4,Great product!,I bought this for my daughter & she loved it!!! She uses it all the time and I think the sturdiness of it is just fine. We have a huge family and whenever the kids come over and play it is a big hit!
3,Outrageous costs,My now 7 year old loved this chair and we were pleased with the cost of about $20-$25 then. I went online to purchase this chair for my now 1yr old nephew and I am appalled at the cost! $199?? What is the deal with that? I gave away the chair to a neighbor child. Can anyone explain the cost increase? Loved the item and cost when it was cost-appropriate. It is not worth the amount asked for. Do not pay it. Can anyone explain why the increase?
3,This chair is marred by stability problems,"There's no doubt at all that this Song & Story Learning Chair is cute, educational, fun for toddlers, and worth buying; however, the chair has serious -- no, egregious -- stability issues that come from a design flaw. The chair is not properly weighted or designed: it flips up and over when my toddler gets up from the chair as he touches anywhere on the storybook or table area. The chair tips over far too easily for its targeted age range, and this *is* a serious design flaw and problem for parents. Toy designers know that safety is the number issue, and I cannot believe that Fisher-Price did not follow through and correct this second iteration of its musical chair."
5,Excellent,"This is the best fragrance I have ever worn. Very manly, and my wife loves it! I have worn it since about '94. The Amazon price is almost half of a dept. store and shipping was extremely quick. A great value!"
4,Always a good read.,"Rosamunde Pilcher does not disappoint- ever! I never tire of her touching stories and her descriptions of Scotland & Great Britain, and the love she shows towards her characters is sweet and intimate.Always enjoyable stories with captivating characters."
1,boring,only buy this game if you like killing guys that look like their on steroids and enjoy long impassable levels.this game is extremely hard and isn't fun to play.
2,Lovely - But not for Weddings,"I thought this was a nice book, but I don't think all the readings are wedding appropriate. After reviewing it, I had a hard time finding one that I would like read for my wedding. Like I said, lovely poetry but I would necessarily refer to them ALL as wedding readings."
1,one year lifetime,"I bought this shaver about one year ago. For years I was using Braun shavers and was happy with them but decided to try competition. In spite of few people on internet who mentioned short lifespan I gave Panasonic a try.Shaving is fine, it runs quiet and you get 5-7 shaves with one charge. After about one year it started making strange noise and you get only 3-4 shaves with one recharge. Month later slowly went dead. Exactly as some other people wrote on bulletin boards, what make me to believe to those people writing reviews.You would expect more shave for $100. Today I went to buy Braun shaver."
2,"Pink ""Plasticized"" Proguard",Have been using it for 4 weeks and it is broken already. All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing. The color is good.
2,its ok,the case is ok. it wasn't what i expected and the belt clip does not hold well. The case does not always stay shut. my phone fell out of the case several times to the ground.
3,A good suspenseful read,I think this book was a great suspenseful read. The Iowa farm culture was accurately described and was a great backdrop. The barn scene was a little disturbing but was great nonetheless.
1,Jake Riley,I don't think that this book is a very depiction of what it is like to be a teen-ager. It seems like it was writtne by someone who is kind of old and out of it.
3,Soft Porn,"I came to read the reviews and found none, so this will be my first.This movie is what I would call soft porn, and in that area I would recommend to adults, nice lesbian scene and several other straight scenes to keep you awake. It also carries a weak plot so next time I watch it, maybe I will add more comments.Thx to whoever brought this type of movie to the market, now I can be charged up with out throwing up."
5,Pickup covers,"These EMG-type pickup covers give your guitar's ""open-coil"" humbuckers that ""Active"" look...without altering the pickup's tone. The only thing I'd reccommend, is to make sure your existing pickup routs are large enough for the slightly bigger covers to fit (you might have to re-rout the corner edges slightly, for the squared-off cover edges). Other than that...these are an excellent looking ""upgrade"", for anyone looking for that ""Active"" look...without the hassle of buying new pickups."
3,"Warm, but deffinately not burning","In my opinion this was a decent novel, as far as romance novels go. However, there were a number of holes in the plot that were never addressed. One being the death of Melania's father. Just because it was not Wulfred himself that killed him makes it acceptable?? Was he not the commander? Were people not killed on his orders? He had Melania laying next to her father's mutulated body for some type of perverse visual effect, but she still falls in love with him? Second, Melania constantly tries to kill herself to avoid torture and abuse, but Wulfred never really did anything to her! He stopped her from working, made sure she had good food & rest, no one touched her and then he married her, for crying out loud! For all his talk of making her suffer and such, how does that make sense? And finally where is the dialogue in this book? Most of conversation took place in their heads. I would probably pick up another book by this author, but ""To Burn"" was just warm at best."
2,"Published in 1989, but reads like 1959","I have often referred to this guide over the years for 'etiquette' advice, but the information about addressing invitations, etc has really dissappointed me. This book is sorely out of date. Ms. Swartz, please release a new, updated edition to reflect the equal status of men and women servicemembers!"
4,All that you might come to expect...,"...from software versions of Jeopardy. The interface is good and pretty intuitive for a console game. Of course, you don't have those ""wonderful"" install problems like the earlier PC version of the game with the funky Quicktime 2.0 installs."
1,Your next question: Is this game boring? YES!,"This game is sooooooooooooo boring! My brother rented it for me one day and I nearly fell asleep! Even the Nintendo version is funner then this! THIS IS ABSOULTLY BORING! The questions are hard, theres nothing else to do but awnser one boring question after another. I wouldn't recomend it. If you must play it, rent it. DON'T, I repeat, DON'T buy this game with out trying it first!"
1,Disappointment...,"There was little info on this product and the one small picture. There was no mention of what the toy was made of, etc. Now I know why. It is a subtle (and effective!) way for the manufacturer to sell a cheap floppy FOAM costume for close to $40, incl. S&H.; And I can't really say I was mislead, because the product info was simply omitted...Add to this the fact that children shop ""visually""...the toy looked fine in the tiny picture...And so, my son's puppy-dog eyes clinched the deal. The order was late, but when it finally arrived, my son gleefully opened the box. Instead of a quality costume one would expect due to the over-$30-pricetag, there was this ugly, flimsy foam nightmare. Oh, and the flaccid sword was torn. I am too tired of hassling with this order to request a refund. Keep my money. Just know that my son was sooo disappointed. He tried to act grown-up about it, but he sobbed quietly for a few minutes. Lesson learned."
3,Wish I could tell Bill...........,"This video is FULL of wonderful people and songs, but Bill starts talking about them and they don't finish the songs! Seems to me it would have been just as easy to tell the stories and still let us hear the entire song. I found it frustrating - beautiful, but frustrating."
1,not good,iten dont have any way to transfer to a pci wish i can change it to a better mosel that can be changedplease let me know if u can change it and replace it with 1 that has a usb
4,Olympus VN4100 Digital Voice Recorder,"Olympus VN4100 Digital Voice RecorderThis product is great! the file size settings are handy for keeping them low to fit on this recorder. Although, if you want to archive the files, i would really recommend get the next version with a usb adapter to be able to download the files to your computer. The mic on this one is very sensitive, so it picks up just about any thing!"
2,Not as good as I hoped,It does not pick up sound from across the room well. I bought it for a class but have not been able to get it to record well enough to help.
3,Olympus VN4100 Digital Voice Recorder,The recorder works fine. I was disappointed on how long it took the vendor to box the order and get it shipped.
5,"Easy to use, easy to transfer files","I am using these to record phone interviews (using with the TP-7 telephone pickup). The quality of the audio is very good, you have to toggle the quality to see what works for you.It is quite easy to transfer files. The wave files are pretty big so converting to mp3 format may be necessary depending on your needs.Would definitely recommend."
3,Underwhelming,"I thought I would get an explanation of why the Allied air forces could not discern the buildup in the Ardennes. But Whiting does not offer an explanation. Instead he focuses on the mismash of intelligence failures. But, you don't get to know any of the characters very well. Plus, from a writing perspective, Whiting has to many long, disconnected subclauses that are difficult to comprehend. Finally, he repeats himself often. Don't pay full price for this book. It is not essential to your WWII collection!"
1,TERRIBLE,"Exuse me,is it just me or does it look like This game is no fun. If you want a real baseball game, get an all star baseball title.I mean come on, the graphics stink, and its the easiest game ever. Even if you dont like my review because you think Ken Griffey Jr. is cool, Other games have Griffey in them too that actully have good graphics and gameplay."
1,Not for me,I have prominent dark circles but this product did not work for me. I find it too thick and patchy. Bobby brown is working for me.
2,Puff Piece,"This book was a fun enough read; if it were a movie, one might say, ""I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater, but it was ok as a rental."" But while its subtitle and some reviews have suggested this work is definitive, it is far from that. It reads like a very long magazine article, and no wonder, since it appears to be a compilation of many such preexisting sources.The book is well peppered with anecdotes, but it never rises beyond entertaining to thought-provoking. Konow purports to have a thesis - grunge killed heavy metal - but falls short of ever making an argument. He spends a lot of time on ""the hair bands,"" exposing them in all their shallowness. Fairly early on, the reader can't help but notice a similarlity between these glam bands and the book itself: big image, little substance."
2,Bang Your Head...Against a Wall,"If you are a true fan of heavy metal, or even a lover of music, you will hate this book. The Author seemingly did no research short of watching a VH-1 Behind the Music Marathon. Everything, but every single fact, story, anectdote in this book, comes from a Behind the Music episode, or a myth told by your father, or is just common knowledge, even to the musical layman. i.e. Black Sabbath and Led Zepplin were the fathers of heavy metal. If you are looking for some serious in depth, insightful writing on the heavy metal scene, and the 'rise and fall' thereof, I urge you to read another book, because this one will not satisfy. On the other hand, if you are a novice to the field, you may find this book a good stepping stone to further study. On the whole, poor research, and disappointing reading from what is an interesting topic, could have been a fascinating book."
5,Pat Metheny Songbook,i want to sing the praises of amazon.com first in saying that the price was the lowest found and they shipped a day earlier than stated during the week of christmas!!my husband is thrilled with the product!! he can now learn the complex songs of an artist he has enjoyed for over 20 years!
2,the video itself was in great shape.,"video was in great shape. I just didn't care for the movie. The packaging was great the price was right , I just didn't care about the acting."
1,What if you get a defective Heater ?,"It's not a bad little heater but I had a problem with the front knob falling off.I bought it from ""heaterusa"", through Amazon.com.I have yet to receive any help from anyone, warranty or not.Amazon.com could not help, the company? ""heaterusa"" seems totally non-existant.I tried e-mailing them through Amazon, I tried to access them through the internet directly, I could not find a web site.I assume Amazon.com checked them out before bringing them onboard.I called the 800 number on the heater, I did get a recording that gave an international no., Tiwan ? It didn't work either.So...there's my two cents worth on this product.Dave Hamilton"
3,Heater runs constantly,"A very nice heater but its thermostat only turns it down to its lowest speed, it is not capable of turning the heat function off entirely. This is a serious short coming because the heater can't be left as self tending"
1,very little unit...semi decent heat....,"I bought this thing from the DO it best website and if you ever notice some people only write bad reviews ,some good and then some review EVERYTHING !!!I go both ways....IF a product is great I REVIEW...If a product sucks...I REVIEW..if it's OK...it's not worth my time..THIS PRODUCT ""The Pelonis space heater"".... undoubtedly a waste of money. It worked just good enough to heat my bathroom. I paid $100 at the time. It's heavy, but small. I thought it would work great ...I thought it would be much bigger.... SAVE YOUR MONEY...BUY A PATTON... I grew up with them and they still work great ....Pelonis can keep selling their crap..BUT I'm NOT buying it anymore......"
2,Very disappointing,"*Potential spoiler*I gave this a low rating for one reason only; the way they implemented the plot/story. I enjoyed this game very much, up until the point where I became a spirit eater. I enjoy a slow pace to RPG's, so I can be somewhat free to explore and do different things. Once I became a spirit eater, I found that I was spending most of my time just dealing with devouring/exorcizing spirits... and that just got too frustrating. That, by itself, made the game unenjoyable for me."
4,Pretty Good Add-on,"As most of you know, I'm a huge fan of RPG PC Games, and NWN2 is no exception. MOTB is a good add-on that gives you 10 to 20 hours more gaming fun. The story is great, but it was very frustrating in some ways, as you were forced to follow a path that, to me, seemed kind of evil (I usually play nuetral, lawful good, good, etc characters). Other than that, it was nice to see the creator of the game push the limits of what is acceptable in RPG's without turning too many people off completely. I'm not sorry I bought the add on, and if you are a fan of the NWN series you must have this for your collection."
2,no mariokart,"this game is the first step into reality racing but it has a very far way to go. its good for a day with a hangover or if your stoner friend comes to town, but thats about it."
3,ages 5-13,"game is dedicated to the name of the car, along with style. but lacks in flexibilty of play and graphics."
3,Sado-masochistic difficulty,"I was highly anticipating Excitebike 64. I came really close to preordering it. I had read positive reviews before it came out. But I had to rent it. And I'm glad that I did.I don't know why, but this just doesn't seem like an Excitebike game. It has the feel of a regular old motorcycle racing game. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.Also, you'll find that this game has one of the most insanely high difficulty levels ever. Usually, I do very well at racing games, but this is insane. Some may find that addictive, but I found it to be offputting. I didn't WANT to play it anymore, because I knew I would go nowhere. I mean, even the tutorial is somewhat difficult. INSANITY!!So, if your into sado-masochism, I say give it a whirl. But if you hate to have a game constantly and consistently kick you arse with no hope of advancement, skip it."
2,It's not what you think it is!,"Well I rented this game and when I got it I thought is was going to be the best! But it Wasn't. The graphics are ok but not to good. When your riding your bike It's really hard to controle the bike. The corners are to thin so it makes it really hard to turn. The Riders, there really is no proffesional people in the game. They just make up the people. When your at the start line you fell like just going as fast as you want but you can't. You only get a alimated amount of time to have the turbo. So all of this bad stuff, this is why i gave it 2 stars."
1,pffft...,I was really hoping for more displays of actual artwork.. i found this boring and completely un-artistic in nature. Don't waste your time on this one folks.. Unless your out of sleeping pills... I would give it negative stars if i could.
5,Intriguing,Very interesting look at an art project with a unique look at the female figure.Some interesting details on anatomy.Not an erotic film by any means.
5,aaron neville review,I purchased this CD as a birthday present for a friend and she really loved it. I was very impressed because I received the item so quickly. I made sure to tell all my friends how promptly I received the item I ordered.
2,Wilson Golf Putting Pal II,There's too much of an incline and the ball doesn't return far on the rug even with new batteries.
4,Well built lock.,"This lock is very well made. The tricky part is drilling the hole in the seat frame to install it. The description (below) also says it comes with two locks, which it doesn't. It's a single lock.""It is keyed alike - either key will open both locks. It comes with 2 keys, 2 locks that use the same key."""
3,Wow!,this book is awesome it helped me find romance and get eveything i desired. This book is the best thing that has ever happened to me!
3,Good. But not great.,"I know many of Richard Shindell's fans think the world of this recording, but it just has never quite hit the bulls eye like Sparrows Point and Blue Divide did. The song, The Next Best Western is probably my favorite song on the album. I would probably recommend this album, but it should be the third one of his to pick up. The first should be Sparrow's Point followed closely behind by Blue Divide."
3,Shark finning and creepy reptiles!,"Fish and Wildlife Agent Rachel Porter is at it again ... This time, she's in Hawaii. The usual intrigue is present and Rachel solves the mystery in the end, but this outing isn't as satisfying as the first two books in the series."
5,A 'must' book for anyone interested in Russian history.,"A fascinating account of the aftermath of the Decembrist uprising in 1825 and the major role taken by Mariya Volkonskaya in creating a livable environment for the families of the exiled rebels. I was impressed by the way in which these aristocrats, led by Mariya and several other wives, adjusted to a harsh climate and inhumane treatment and managed to not only survive but to build their own effective little society. The book will also be of interest to those interested in womens' contributions to 19th century life."
1,No help - spend your $ on the book.,"Book reviews -- particularly book reviews for which one is being charged $6 -- can often give a clear understanding of the thesis, and (as any graduate student can attest) save you reading hundreds, even thousands, of pages. Such was my hope for this review. Mistake! This is a standard, very short, superficial, write-it-to-get-a-publication, review. You come away with very little more information than from Amazon's blurb about the book. Shame on you, Amazon, for charging $6 for this almost-worthless item."
1,The 10 Bucks Back Deal Is Over! It Is Expired!,The Pretender is an awesomely good TV show but why buy this starter set that only has one episodes from the first season when you can buy the complete first season DVD boxset and get this eipisode and all the rest of the season one episodes? And don't give me any garbage about it being worth it because you get 10 dollars back with the included coupon because that ten bucks back deal has long expired! Only people who like to waste money would buy this!
3,NFL Quarterback Club 98',"Although the realism of this game is pretty good, the game program itself is riddled with errors. After picking up free agents in the manage rosters section and saving and loading the game, the free agents all show up as a kicker named Clark. What's the point of free agency if it can't be used properly. Furthermore, player stats in career mode aren't always saved. I recorded 8 sacks for Bryce Paup in Game 1 of a season, and it just doesn't recognize it. Again, what's the point? Overall, the game is pretty good, but needs a lot of work."
5,A great lesson in self worth!,"""A Snoodles Tale"" is a definite must see for everyone. It's a wonderful story that conveys how much worth we have regardless of how others look at us. It's great for kids and adults. I showed it to an adult friend, and she wept."
5,WONDERFUL MESSAGE,"This is one of the best Veggie Tales stories I have ever seen. I have been touched by many a Veggie Tale movie, but this one has one of the most wonderful messages any child can ever hear.....just how intensely God really loves them and how that loving God thinks each child is so incredibly wonderful. What a great fact to understand. This is a wonderful introduction to God's love for children and an even more wonderful reminder of it for adults."
4,"Good charger, minor problems","Things I love about this charger:- Quick charges aaa's in around an hour- Option to soft-charge for when I'm not in a hurry can extend battery life- Automatic condition mode refreshes batteries- Independent charging circuits ensure that each battery is charged, but not overchargedI have noticed that the contacts for aaa batteries are extremely short (they stick up from the bottom of the charger, and not particularly far), and as a result, sometimes cause problems if the battery has a plastic label that wraps a bit over the end. I purchased some Tenergy aaa's that had plastic covering a small portion of one end, and the charger refused to charge them until I pushed the covering back about one millimeter."
1,Dangerous!,"I would not suggest buying this! It started making sparking sounds & got really hot after being on for less than 2 hours.It has great features & I was really excited about the display (dim, but who cares) & being able to charge 8 batteries instead of 4, like my old one. Luckily I tried it right away & was sitting in the same room when it started making noises! Scary."
1,"difficult to see display, terrible design","The display on this charger is boneheaded. The slots on the display do not line up with the battery, and the ""done"" indicator is less than a 4 point font, invisible from more than a few feet away and from any angle other then straight on. The soft charge button is slow to respond, and is shown in an equally small font size. The lack of any back light makes it even harder to read the undersized text. It's 2012, and this charger is an insult to industrial design. I have one of these in a production environment and everyone complains about it. Sitting right next to the PowerEx 4 cell charger/analyzers with their bright easy-to-read displays, this product looks like a complete dinosaur."
5,Larson re-seen still rules....,"You may find that you have, in fact, seen some of these panels before (in spite of the blurb implying the contrary.) So what, I say; they -- like day-old pizza -- are better the second time around, particularly when nothing else in the cartoon fridge appeals. Beyond the yummy satiric art, the layout of the calendar pages is just right with a desk ""footprint"" so modest that the use/entertainment-per-square-inch has to be the industry leader!"
1,Even caviar tastes terrible if you eat it too much,"Larson is a genius, no doubt. He gave us great work. BUT I'm so sick and tired of seeing the same cartoons over and over and over again just packaged differently. Do we cartoon lovers look like idiots? If Larson is done doing cartoons, that's fine, BUT get NEW material in there.I've seen other cartoonists who can fill this bill quite nicely. Dana Summers' Bound and Gagged is good. Put some of this stuff out. A new cartoon that I really like a lot, Reynolds Unwrapped by Dan Reynolds, is as good or better than The Far Side. Surely, your company can come up with some new material instead of selling us the same thing over and over."
4,no unlockables[in 2-4p mode],"you can go to all couses and battle in multiplayer. hip hip horay, i mean hip hip hooray!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A even title that can hold it's own.,Diddy Kong has a better graphics system then Mario Kart and gameplay is faster and less sluggish. Alltogether a good game to own and worth the money if under fifteen bucks.
4,Fun!,This game is fun but it can be hard to beat at times. But the huge pig you have to race is like nothing I've ever seen! He's huge and you get a tingly feeling in the pit of your tummy when you race him. I absolutley LOVE him! Please rent this game if you can.Thanks
2,Bad Multiplayer,"As I am a big fan of Mario Kart, I was excited to hear about the release of this game, however, after renting it I was disappointed to find it so unapplealing. I purchase Nintendo 64 games to play with my friends, and the mutliplayer on this game is very poor. It lacks any decent for of ""Battle Mode,"" which is the selling point for Mario Kart. The graphics, theme and sound are all very cutesy, geared for children, which didn't fly to well with me. That aside the Racing portion of the game is highly interesting. Having the option between driving a plane, hovercraft and car is fun. The adventure seems well done. However, there is nothing that caught my interest for more than 5 minutes. Renting it for 5 days was more than enough play time for me."
1,Nothing could suck the life out of a biology class faster than this book!,"If you want solutions to enrich your curriculum, this is not the product for you. The first part of the book is basic classroom management and the remaining material is useless activities like cross-words and word searchers that are biology themed.I was really hoping for some motivating and instructional activities for my class, but this book was very disappointing.I found Biological Inquiries by Shields to be a much better choice.Biology Inquiries: Standards-Based Labs, Assessments, and Discussion Lessons (Jossey-Bass Teacher)"
5,Excellent and thorough,"By far the most complete and up-to-date treatment of hominid evolution I have encountered. Covers every aspect of paleoanthropology, including climatic changes and dating techniques, in great detail and precision, but with language that even a non-scientist such as myself can understand. An outstanding reference book."
3,It was Okay.....,"I bought this book without skimming through it like I should have. I personally thought it was going to be more ""Fun Stuff"" and less ""Trivia"" questions. That aside, I would probably have bought it anyway, but if you don't want ""trivia"", then you may not want this book (I'd estimate it at 75% trivia questions). At times I felt like I was taking an exam in school. So I would put it down for a few days! IT IS FULL OF INFORMATION, but the amount of trivia (for me) starts making it too ""dry"" to read like a book, and not much ""Fun""!"
5,good value,I was happy with my purchase of the radish sprouting mix. They are quite spicy and hot! So if you like a hot sprout you won't be disappointed!
1,Avoid N.E.W. extended warrantee,"It has been six months and I still have not received my check from N.E.W. for a replacement scanner (that they can't fix). N.E.W claimed they sent me three checks, and I never received any of them. It is hard to imagine N.E.W is a legitimate company. My complaints to Amazon are blown off with an email reply stating that N.E.W is a vendor and Amazon has no control over their vendors."
5,Warranty Check Received!,"I had an Archos 5 160GB that refused to hold a charge for more than 30 minutes. This was just after 1 year of ownership. Called NEW, and they sent me a UPS label via email within 2 business days. I sent the package out the next day. When they realized they couldn't fix the issue they just decided to give me what I paid for the Archos. I got a check in 7 business days.Customer Service was more than adequate and I had no issues filing a claim. Just perfect for me."
1,Not everything,"Read the plan carefully. Not everything is covered under this plan. They will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they don't have to pay. Too many exclusions for an ""everything is covered policy"" Don't waste your money"
2,not sing along,"The images are colorful and music is good enough. But I must have mis read that this was a sing along, as when a person reads each page, my toddler naturally wants to hit the button that corresponds to the page. Of course this causes the music to play and reading w/the music relating to the page is very difficult, as it doesn't ""match"" the words or theme showing!So buy it and just enjoy the music and read later."
2,Too fragile for a toddler,This book is too fragile for a toddler to handle. Its nearly impossible to open up the page and try to have a 3D look without tear off parts of it. The pages are too flimsy. Battery issues as with other song books exist too.
1,Heartwork Not Artwork,"Aside from the fact that some of the images used in the book are questionable, the book Heartwork, is not up to quality in the printed and final product, in my opinion."
3,Okay but not the best,"This was purchased as a replacement for a very costly omelet pan that finally wore out. The weight is good and the finishing is adequate. Unfortunately, the lip of the pan is not designed to make sliding the omelet out easily. It's not a bad value but if you are very fussy about construction, you may want to consider spending more to get the best."
1,3 Parakeets and 6 Cockatiels......,"Not one of them ended up liking them.They pecked at them a bit at first.So I have a few bags just sitting around.When I first opened a bag it smelled great,but they seemed to be stale.All of them were like a mixture of styrofoam and cardboard.I guess I'll stick with the natural popcorn they love so much."
5,an early day race game,with this race game same as any other game there are difficulty levels for the experienced or the starters. a whole bunch of different types of maps to race.
2,"Slow, slow, slow.","Others have pointed out how the CD is filled with a mere 11 songs due to their length. In part, the length of the individual songs is caused by slow tempos. Medicated Goo and Dear Mr. Fantasy are particularly somnolent. The aged rockers seem simply unable to keep up with their legacy. On the plus side, Steve Winwood's guitar playing is as good as ever."
4,their best live album,"It may not be the original Traffic personnel, but it is the best live album they ever put out. The sound is great, and often the music cooks.Why just four stars? - I don't overrate albums (like most people).If you know of Traffic, but not a Traffic fan, this won't convert you. Then again, if you like jam band music, and you are not familiar with Traffic, this will convert you. Traffic was in very much a blueprint for later jam bands (as was, of course, the Grateful Dead). If you are a Traffic fan, you are in for a treat."
1,Oh !! I am dissapointed !! It's all about fire !!,"Don't buy this DVD ! I was expecting to see her dance, but she doesn't. In the introduction, I counted it with my watch (I promise) she doesn't even dance for 30 seconds !! Next, Tammy and Kelly, okey, they are very flexible and good dancers but only teach you a couple of moves. In summary, the 75% of the DVD is all about FIRE, the safety instructions and bla bla, and everytime repeting the same images about a woman dancing with fire. The 25% is separted into 10% Tammy , 10% Kelly , 4,5% contortions and an insignificant 0,5% Fawnia! I totally threw my money into the garbage. I don't suggest buying this DVD! I am new in Amazon and I didn't take seriously the reviews of the people but from now on I will be more cautious."
4,"It's a good game, but a couple of drawbacks","This game is very cool. I got it like when it came out in 98. Graphics are ok, the fade-aways are just fine, the jogging and walking is very cool, also how easy it is to trade, sign, and release players. How you can use more than 1 team to play w/ in the season. Now the drawbacks, it really... when you see Mugsy Bogues grabbing rebound, and dunking over Patrick Ewing?!? Kind of ridiculous huh? Also foul shots are so very hard to learn. I played a 52 game season and was waiting so anxious to see what would happen when I won the champion ship, it was like watching ants crawl back to their nest after eating. They walked off the court like nothing at all happened. But I still play the game b/c it's fun to me."
1,Don't bother,I wanted a full size keyboard I could put in my (large and heavy) laptop bags. A keyboard with poor touch that requires that much preasure to type on isn't worth having. I filed it in drawer 13. Live and learn. It is waterproof and flexible.
1,Not As Described,"The Product Description for the USB Flexible Full Sized Keyboard, states ""The illuminated design makes it more cyber and useful, you can use it in a low-light environment."" The keyboard I received from Cables4You wasn't illuminated, you canNOT use it in a low light. Either this was a very mis-leading description, or they didn't send me the item described (which is probably since it wasn't in the box/package that was pictured)."
5,Rolls out,Only came in an envelope. I think the shipping would pay for at least a box big enough to hold it $5.99. Also it came with no adapter as stated but i don't need it.
2,A novelty,"The item was shipped immediately and arrived earlier than expected. The item was accurately described and portrayed in the ad, but I would not recommend the product for regular use. It may be okay for children or extremely dusty areas. The keys are spaced further apart than a standard keyboard. The space bar is not a bar, rather only buttons. The keys must be pressed deliberately and directly. Not for fast typing."
2,own both a bunny and a guinea,"I own both a rabbit and a guinea pig. The guinea pig is spoiled and very picky so I expected him not not like it, how ever my bunny is a garbage disposal and didn't like it. Package was open and seeds were everywhere so maybe it lost its appetizing smell? Not sure."
2,"so far so good, but it lost chanels","I have tried its recording and used it as the ATSC OTA receiver in the last 3 months. It worked OK so far, except one thing: the player lost channels every few days.It's really annoying that I have to rescan channels every 2-3 days.Upconversion to 1080p doesn't work ( I have a 1080p LCD TV), but can only get 720p or 1080i.Their tech support is lying that 1 in 10K units has this problem (see other review). From the limited number of reviews, the problem of losing channels is prolific (4 out of 7 reviews have this problem). Toshiba, shame on you to put defective products for sale!"
3,Very disappointing entry in the series,"My first Aunt Dimity book was Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil. I loved it. While still being a cozy mystery, it added an original and charming touch. I then started reading all the other Aunt Dimity books from the beginning. For the most part, I have liked them all. This book was so disappointing. The conclusion to the mystery is awful as is the 'isn't this a great place to live' wrapup at the end. I agree with some other reviewers that the 'Lori's wandering eye' plot is wearing thin. She has become a character that doesn't fit with the charm of the series. I am beginning to wish that Emma was the main female character."
2,Not much fun...,"I was pretty disappointed in this latest Aunt Dimity installment. I really enjoyed all the previous books in the series, and was very much looking forward to this one.The ""Lori-meets-attractive-men-and-must-resist-their-charms"" angle is getting tiresome. It was just plain annoying to read about her aborted dalliance with Nicholas. If this is so important to the author, why not split up Lori and Bill and turn her into a divorced mom, entering the dating scene.The ""quaint"" townsfolk are starting to annoy me, as well. And, to me, the mystery was not believable either. Neither was the secret behind Nicholas's visit to Finch.I am really glad I did not pay full-price for this book. I will certainly read the next installment, but if it turns out to be as lackluster as this one, I may forego any further Aunt Dimity novels."
4,Full of information.,"This book has a ton of information on herbal remedies. I didn't like the layout of it, but I'm still very satisfied."
4,Pretty cool racing game,"Being creative in a racing game is kind of hard since racing is a pretty one-dimensional concept: get to the finish line before the other guy. However, by adding weapons to the equation, Nintendo created a very exciting racing game!No wait, that was Super Mario Kart for SNES.However, this game is not an ordinary racing game either. This is mostly because the tracks are very different. Some track segments are contained in pipes where every way is up. Two tracks are made out of a big cylander and you race on the outer surface (maybe this was done in Wipeout, but I've never played that). There's a lot of cars to choose from (maybe too many if you ask me), and you can alter your car before each race.Overall, a good game, but nothing spectacular."
4,This game is the fastest game I ever played!,I think this F-zero is better than the one for SNES because this one u have tons of more cars than the SNES one. oh yeah in death race I beat it in 49 seconds.
4,good greatest hits,"This greatest hits collection has a very mixed collection of shania's different country music styles, personally i have prefered the more soft rock influence in her tracks and the more modern country song with the last 2 albums, there are 2 new songs ""party for two"" which was a good new song to include, but unfortunately the other - ""Don't!"" isn't very good, its a ballad, and usually shania does this very well but this is no ""forever and for always"" or ""From this moment"", its quite a boring song that doesn't go anywhere. Apart from that a good selection, i would recommend it to people who haven't got all of shania's songs from other albums, otherwise don't buy it just for the 2 new tracks."
3,Shania needs to choose..Billy Currington or Sugar Ray,"This greatest hits in a way is a freaking joke. All the Greatest Hits are off only THREE ALBUMS, with only a few off the UP album...mostly two albums. Couldn't she release at least ONE more album before giving us a Greatest Hits album. Also, why must there be two fricking versions of the song ""Party for Two"" Either choose the horrible singing Billy Currington who has no future in country music or the drunk guy from Sugar Ray...do we honestly need a pop and country version of this song on a greatest hits CD? If you weren't one of the 10 million people who picked up COME ON OVER or one of the 10 Million people who picked up The Woman in Me, then buy this CD."
2,Fatiguing And Unflaggingly Magnificent,"Shania is beautiful and she's had a few hits produced by her famous producer/manager husband. This is a splendid collection of those country flavored pop anthems. Her voice is decent, but not exceptional, and she's extremely attractive too. The music enhances her physical attributes when she dances, and she always looks good in front of a camera, as opposed to behind it."
2,Eh not the best Greatest Hits...,"This album has some good songs but many songs on here are very forgetable.Like if you're gonna put bonus song's on the album don't put the same song more then once on the album what's the point of putting 2 versions of the same song?Im talking about ""Party For Two"" that is the worst song I've heard from Shania in a while has she lost her touch?This Greatest Hits collection is not the best but I suggest you try out -Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (Limited Edition with Bonus CD) [LIMITED EDITION] by Britney Spears Now that Greatest Hits collection has hits and great songs!"
4,MIssing her best song!,"I'd give this 5 stars if only You've Got A Way was on here. Don't get me wrong, it's a great cd, but the most beautiful song is missing. From This Moment is just as good, but YGAW is another fantastic song and it was a hit when Notting Hill was a hit, so where is it? The video was beautiful too. At least her other boppy songs are here so there is plenty of good listening."
5,Simply Stunning!!,A collection of all of our favorite Shania hits on one CD! It's hard to get enough of it. All of the classics are included as well as three new songs. Which I'm sure will be hits of their own in the near future. An excellent addition to anyone's album collection!
1,the game is okay,the graphics are bad and you cant tell when you are going to hit a corner overall bad game
2,Too thin,I bought this to wear under my helmet but it was too thin for the cold but was great quality.
3,Warm but Wearable,The product was new when it arrived and after 3 hunting trips it came home in pieces. The price was good but the quality was not!
1,Not a bargain,Picture is VERY deceptive. This balaclava is very very thin...think panty hose. Very easily snagged and certainly not much in extra warmth.
1,BEWARE OF THIS SELLER,"I recieved what was supposed to be the package that carried this 'balaclava mask' I ordered and when I opened the package there was NOTHING there !! The seller did not even send the product I ordered, Just an empty package . and I also had paid extra for faster shipping.I have tried contacting the seller about this problem and they have not replied."
3,"Not bad, but not really good either...","The controls are nice, the graphics are also nice, but the fun factor just doesn't seem to be there. Many games seem to have terrific graphics, but unless they're fun to play, they're relatively worthless. This is one of those games. My suggestion is to go with NBA Live 2000 over this one, as it may not boast the 30 dunks animations or whatever, but it is extremely fun to play, and to me, that's what matters most."
2,This is one of the [worst] games ever!,I've tried ALOT of NBA games and I'm saying that this game is not worthy of buying. The graphics or not nearly as good as NBA Live 2000. The control of the players are not good at all. It isn't very realistic. I strongly suggest NOT to buy this game.
3,13 Inch AC/DC TV with DVD,TV arrived in good shape but there is some discoloration of the screen on the lower left side. The degaussing circuit doesn't seem to affect it at all. As time goes on the discoloration seems to be going away.
4,family fun,"Our family really enjoys this game. Since it is only a 2 player game we take turns racing each other and the other takes on the winner. We also take turns racing in the circuit mode(one player) and see who can place 4th or better. As you race through the tracks you can pick up nitro's that helps you fight your way from the rear or you can pick up cash that you can later buy stuff that helps beef up your vehicle. This is a simple game to learn and play and challenging enough to keep you interested. My 7 year old enjoys it also because she can also win, so nobody dominates the game."
2,Comes Up Short,"I can't say that I would recommend this movie unless you've watched every other Hong Kong, crime drama available already. It's not the worst movie I have ever seen but not the best by a long shot. Daniel Wu plays a man with a serious deformity of his face who is a sniper for a gangster . His brother played by Lam Suet also works for the gangster. It's basically a cliched, Hong Kong, crime thriller with not much plot and not much dialogue and were Daniel Wu and Lam Suet not in the film it would have fallen by the wayside even more than it has. Basically a wasted 87 minutes for me watching it until the end. If you must watch it find a rental or a bagain bin it might be sold in."
3,works great,It fits the 02 quadrunner with a litte bit of grinding. It helps clear the bigger tires with ease. works
2,"Please, you must be too happy.","After a ""piece"" like ""The Secrets At This Wedding"" or most anything on this album I have been turned off by Christine Lavin. I have never heard any of these songs when she performed live, now I know why. Other that ""*69"" this album sucks so hard it blows. If you want to continue to like Christine lavin, skip this album."
5,best buy,These Spanish Disney Stories are a real delight to read. Instead of buying them separately in books -what a value I'd recommend getting both volumes.
4,Help from one down the path a few more steps,"My first question was, ""Did he bug my office and spy on me for year to get the material for this book?"" Serving in a rural area, it is easy to feel as if you are alone in pastoral leadership. Especially when it comes to conflict. After all, you are the new one in town. Gary Preston shares his personal experience (failures and successes) in a brotherly way that is helpful, not condescending. Specific anecdotes and ideas for living in conflict and loving in conflict are much better than just a list on how to deal with conflict. The author addresses two much needed areas: family balance and preaching during controversy. I find these (as did he)difficult but necessary mountains to scale in ministry.Good job, Gary."
3,It looks good.,It looks good but the price doesn't cheap if compare with other brand in same product.
2,was looking forward to until...,"I knew this was going to fit my passport. But one of the things I didn't like when I received this product was with the hazard warning label. In CA, I guess, you need to disclose when a product is made with materials that contain chemicals. This product is one of them. Just Saying... If it wasn't for that, this would of received more stars."

5,outta control,"funny as the rest of the seasons are,this series keeps me laughing whenever i wathc it. i love this anime and i can't wait for the rest of the seasons! more characters show up in their first apperences to the season (except the season 1 opening) including kuno's father and alos azuza returns as well. wonder how long till season 5, hmmm couple of months."
4,plush look at moderate cost,What a difference this dash mat makes!I had a more expensive dash overlay that warped in the Cali sun. This looks grest and won't warp.
4,There is Always an Empty Seat on the Whammy Bar Express to the Downstairs Eternal...,"""Shock Rock"" defied expectations as a surprisingly above-average collection. Nonetheless, several of these tales belong in the accursed hellhole of the bargain bin: ""Voodoo Child"" by Graham Masterson is uneventful; ""You Know they Got a Hell of a Band"" by Stephen King is deadly dull; the colloboration between Billy Mummy and Peter David, ""The Black '59"", is unimaginative. The largest disappointment is John Byrne's ""Hide in Plain Sight"", an amateurish sex romp with an obvious conclusion that reads like it was written by a 14-year-old boy with a hard-on. JOHN BYRNE!! THE GUY WHO DREW THE FANTASTIC FOUR--SUPERMAN--X MEN!! WHAT THE HECKFIRE, BYRNIE!?! The last two tales in the collection, ""Flaming Telepaths"" and ""Addicted to Love"", are two great stories that bring down the curtain. ""Bunky"" is a caffeinated sugar-high that takes a couple reads to comprehend, but it is a worthy contribution. METALLICA DIED WITH CLIFF!!!"
5,"The best of rock n""roll and horror combined !","This is an excellent book combining the best of rock and horror fiction. See my review of Shock Rock 2, a continuation of this fine anthology."
1,Jeep: 1941-2000 Photo Archive,"This publication is much to general to be used for any historical research. It provides a few general photographs of jeeps, but no details to help in the indentification of vintage jeeps. I don't know who could use it."
4,Good for Glock Lovers,"I shoot a Glock 17 and love it. This book is one that all Glock lovers should purchase. If you are interested in additional pistols review this book first.As to Mr. Boatmans politics, I agree with most of what he has to say and totally disagree with Anyone that wants to reduce my ability to purchase, own, carry and use a hand gun.If more people learned how to properly handle a hand gun there would be less so called accidents. There is no such thing as an accident with a hand gun. Only improper handling, storage or carelessness.Mr. Boatman states the facts and each person should come to their own conclusion."
5,Great Coffee Table Book,"I'm not sure why all the low ratings of this book. I think it is a great book, very informative, very entertaining with some of the stories he tells and the title of the book captures the essence of this reading. Living with glocks at home, work, pleasure or competition. I would recommend this to any glock enthusienst. He gives great recomendations from Ammo and Gun Schools, to Handguns and Girls.ENJOY!!!!"
2,Not worth the price for its limited value,"The sole value of this book is the beginning section that gives tips for planning directions for knitting plus sizes. That could have been published as an inexpensive booklet. Although I read the reviews that criticized the styles that make up the vast majority of the book, I was unprepared for how downright unattractive/ugly those garments are. In this case, two stars are generous!"
3,thin yarns for bulky women,One of the premises of this book is that big girls should not use bulky yarn. Therefore all the patterns in this book are at 4 stitches or less to inch. For big sweaters that's a LOT of knitting.
1,The Grand Master--But Not Yet,"Let me be honest about this. This is the first RAH book that I could put down. I have been a Heinlein fan since I read ""Time for the Stars"" when I was 11 years old. I have read every piece of work that came from his pen, and I loved them all! However, ""For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs,"" is ponderous, heavy and dull. I forced myself to read it through, and frankly, dull is the best thing I can say about it. Stolid also comes to mind.Robert Heinlein proved that he was better than this. But this, his first novel, should have been edited down to a short story, and been published in one of the compilations along with some of his other shorts."
4,"For Serious Heinlein fans only, 4 stars--others, maybe 2-3","As Spider discusses in the prologue, this is interesting if you have read his other books to see what he was thinking at the very beginning of his career.That said, this is clearly a first book and perhaps the weakest of any Heinlein book I've read. If you've never read him, this is NOT a good place to start."
5,"A must for serious Heinlein fans, others need not apply!","For someone interested in Heinlein and his ""development"" , this book is fascinating and highly recommended. I put ""development"" in quotes because it was startling to see how EVERYTHING in his later philosophy, characters, etc. were all here in this first book. They didn't change for 50 years---the female stereotype, the sexual freedom, the political beliefs that strangely combine libertarianism with a very strong safety net, etc. I kept saying ""Aha! Starship Troopers"", "" Oh, Stranger in a Strange Land"", etc. I am glad it was published, unlike my feelings about many posthumous publications (like the Walter Miller book).On the other hand, I can see why he could not get it published in 1939. There is almost no story, and it is one long exposition of his philosophy. If you want good SF, read almost anything else."
2,Too Confusing,"The graphics in this game are very cool, however I found this game tedious and confusing at times. This is definately a game for the younger gamers."
5,My Favorite Playstation Game!,"This is the best PlayStation game I have ever played! Join Casper, Kat, Dr. Harvey, the ghostly trio, and the evil Carrigan Crittendon in this fun-filled, puzzle-to-solve game. Press the levers, get keys, and open the doors to find the clues. Casper can morph into objects if you find them, for example, if he turns into smoke he can go through the vents to find more clues."
5,Ever Expanding,"This book has a priority place on my desk book shelf simply because I refer to it often. It is a teaching tool that has served me well over the years. As I come into new ways of seeing and realizing the facts of my life, I find that the book expands in clarity to me and by this token, it is ageless and endless in what it has to offer. I expect it will ever be so."
2,"Poorly written, but still fun to read if you are a real fan","No surprises here. Everything is rather predictable. This is NASCAR's answer to Harlequin Romance novels. Just as women like Harlequin Romance novels despite poor writing, stock car fans will like this book.Characters are rather one dimensional and very very predictable (gee, is Bubba going for food again?). The dialog is extremely stilted. Names of real race car drivers are thrown in for fun (wonder if royalties are paid?) but you will know the outcome before you reach that page. Considering the early days of the sport, it would have been interesting if the promoter screwed Jodell Lee out of his winnings. At least that would have been a plot twist (albeit the first and only plot twist).Still a fun read for at the beach or when your mind is in neutral (or perhaps reverse)."
1,Sloppy distracting formatting,"For a highly nominated author I expected better. I felt conclusions drawn were not based on a real perspective of the eras covered and therefore were wholly subjective conclusions. As there were few records or truths of note for this "" biography "" most of the biography was conjecture."
3,"Challenging, yet dull","Not for beginners, this video is filmed with a solid white background. Some poses have both simple and advanced versions, so you can't outgrow the tape. The sun salutations are good and really get your blood flowing. Great value."
4,Excellent workout!,My family and I (2 teens) bought this video as a way to keep in shape during the cold winter months. We are all in excellent shape and found this video to be challenging but not frustrating. We do it 2-3 times per week and have noticed much progress! It's truly a wonderful workout!
5,They are great!,My husband works very hard and destroys his boots fairly quickly. This is his second pair of these boots and he asked that I get the exact same as his last pair. They have lasted him about 8 months which is 2 months longer then normal. He does wear insoles with them to help the comfort level.
4,it's ok.,"good style,good shape,and good price ,much cheaper than its brother in china.but just a little bit larger than the size what i usually put on."
5,Best boots I've bought,"I bought a pair of theese boots ten years ago and still wear them almost daily today. I did not buy them from Amazon however, but regardless, theese boots are long lasting and tough. I've used them in many jobs in construction and as daily wear throughout the years, this pair has never lost their comfort. I have had to change the laces twice now, and the soles are just starting to come unglued. Of course, they do show their age now so they couldn't be worn to anything formal, but they've lasted forever for me and I will definitely be getting another pair."
3,A good institutional history of the battle of Kursk.,"Mr. Dunn wrote a good institutional history of the battle of Kursk. Having read his previous work, I was not disappointed. However, the use of maps would have made the book more readable. Unlike one of the previous reviewers, the organization of the book made sense to me because I had seen that organization in other military works and had no difficulty working with it. If a reader desires a more ""human"" angle to this great clash, there are better works around but if you want as accurate a reading of what units did what and where, this work meets the need. A parting note on the English translation of the SS division names - what is the big deal - I know who they are."
4,Great Reference book,"A very extensive reference guide to look up various horse ailments, along with their various corresponding homeopathic treatments/remedies. The ""Useful Address Section"" at the back along with a ""How to find a Homeopathic Vet"" are all based on UK (United Kingdom) references though. It would be nice on its next update to have some United States References added. But I recommend it for anyone wanting a good reference guide for Homeopathic Remedies for specific equine conditions."
2,Works less than 1/2 the time,"This device worked about 80% of the time on myself and only about 10% of the time on my father. Unfortunately, it was a Christmas gift for him and not for me.We ended up getting a self inflating one at Circuit City that seems to be working just fine.It IS possible that the problem lies with him - possible faint heartbeat or high blood pressure but it is odd that the one at CC worked just fine."
5,A Decent Air Combat Game,"This is one of the better air combat games. Good graphics, first person viewing, and a good variety of missions make this one a must have for all you Aces out there!"
4,Pretty good but not stellar.,"I bought this CD to use as a backup for a pageant performance and I'm pretty pleased with it. The songs are in the correct keys and sound pretty darn close to the originals. There aren't any guide vocals which I found to be a blessing; no more listening to some half-rate singer faintly chortling along in the background! There are a few parts (mainly the big orchestra solos) where you can tell that a synthesizer was used versus a real band, but these parts are pretty sparse. The only draw-back to this CD is that there are absolutely no backup vocals so the big finales and chorus sections don't pack the oomph that they do in the live performances. Overall, however, I would recommend this CD for local performances, pageantry, or just for some good karaoke time."
5,I been. I gone. I seen.,Christopher Buckley wrote a great book here. Too bad he didn't stick with this sort of writing. Had to make a lving I guess. This book is about the average Joe (sailors on a tramp steamer) and what he has to do to make a living. Ironic that Buckley comes from such an upper toff family --he's the son of Bill Buckley.The folks written about here never went to an Ivy League school. They live in trailer or crappy little houses by the highway somewhere. Buckley celebrates them and entertains us. A great great read.
3,READ DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY!!!,"I just received my ""Evriholder Hi-Reach Cleaning Kit"", and see that it only comes with a few attachments, and NOT ALL THE ONES IN THE PICTURES. Now, I've read the description over more carefully and I do see that it only includes the sponge/squeegee head, static duster and cloth mop head. NOT the ceiling fan cleaner or light bulb twister, as pictured. I should have read more carefully, and will purchase the ceiling fan cleaner separately, as the pole does look quite sturdy."
5,To make a great future have a great foundation,"This game was the foundation of No Mercy, Wrestlemania 2000 and Revenge. It was the reason why most people bought the N64 because the game was so good and so detailed. Simple controls, easy to use, everyone has two finishing manuvers. Wrestlers from WCW, NwO, FMW, AJPW and all over the world! There are championships for different belts where you compete in several matches to win the belt. Four way matches / battle royals, tournament bracketings and round robin tournaments. It is also the first game in the US for blood. However, this is the first in a series of fantastic games, which are now outdated. The wrestlers and even the graphics are now very outdated as well, if you want something more up to date go for WWF No Mercy."
3,Adequate but a little small,"I found the bag to be barely large enough for my Canon XTI with the 18-55 MM lens and Canon 70-300.You cannot put the camera in this bag if you have the zoom lens on the camera body.It's PK for the price but hindsite being what it is, I would opt for a lrger bag."
4,Very good case does the trick,Very good case. Well buildFeels solid and can accommodate lots of stuff.Wish it had a place for a water bottle as well :p
2,Way too small,I was decided to order this bag because the overall review rating are high. Don't be misleading by some of the reviewers that this will fit a DSL with a len attached. It will fit my D90 with a 18-200mm len attached but you need to squeeze it in. I was concerned it will damage my len so gave up. Just a waste of money.
2,The iris won't seem to open,"Got it quickly, good shippping. It fits the camera. The DC iris won't seem to open. I tried plugging it in and removing plug from camera several times. Not sure what to do about it."
1,Immorality runs rampant,"In looking for a new mystery series, I decided to try a book by Michael Jecks and chose this one. It was awful. You could hardly pay attention to the mystery (which was not a winner anyway) for the garbage about the nuns and monks carrying on various affairs. I know that there were people who did not keep their vows, but I honestly doubt that there was ever a convent so filled to the brim with promiscuity. As a reader, you never turned a corner without coming upon a dishevelled nun coming out of the bushes.For someone who was brought up on Ellis Peters' Cadfael or Margaret Frazer's Dame Frevisse or any of the hundreds of other historical mysteries, I can definitely recommend NOT buying this book. As I said, it was awful."
2,not worth it,"I needed simple quick-and-easy DVD burning software for saving data files. Fireman CD/DVD burner seemed ideal, being inexpensive and not being bloated with options I didn't want. But alas, it failed to see my CD/DVD burner, even though numerous other software packages can and work just fine. I could not get Fireman to work and tech support could not help. I gave it 2 stars because I did eventually get it to burn a DVD (but only if logged in as an administrator), the e-mail tech support folks did respond to my plea for help, and for some users it might be ok. But for me it was a wasted purchase. Even when functioning, its minimal capabilities were barely above a command-line interface experience, with little or no quality feedback. I wound up purchasing Roxio's Easy Media Creator 8; it cost a lot more, but worked without a glitch. (I am using an HP Pavillion dual core Athlon 64-X2 with WinXP/SP2.)"
5,Good Transfers Highlight A Great TV Show From The Past,"This is a great collection of 24 episodes Of ""Ozzie & Harriet,"" by far the best collection I've seen. This is so well done, I wish they'd put more of them out, as they are presented here with very good transfers. You can see this DVD set was done with some love to it. This is not done on the cheap. Don't let nit-pickers discourage you. This is a wonderful DVD if you like the Nelson family.If I had my way, I'd also include more of the episodes when Rick and Dave were younger. They are much funnier and better than when the boys were adults.However, whatever the year the writiing in here was great and there were always plenty of laughs. In fact, this might be the only TV sitcom I actually enjoyed the canned laughter - even that was good!A young Ricky had the funniest lines but Ozzie was consistently entertaining, too. Dave and Harriett were subtlely funny and all four of Nelsons were likable that it's almost impossible not to like this show."
5,BOO BOO BEAR GOES WILD,"I've been looking for a Boo Boo Bear for awhile and this one is a TON of fun for my nephew I call Boo Boo Bear. Great product, excellent pakaging, quick delivery... thank you!"
3,"Humorous at times, though not very insightful","This book gets high praise from some, but I didn't find it nearly as funny as I thought I would. Sure, human folly is as great today as it was hundreds of years ago (much less 50 years ago) and you find the same type of behavior today that Schwed did in his day, but a great humorist is usually able to present something more profound than just the goofiness of people trying to get rich. Justin Mamis can be just as humorous, but he gives good advice that you can use and has thoughtful insights about the whole investing/speculating game and how it relates to life. I give Schwed a pass. 3 stars for some of the humor. Why is this an investment classic, though?"
3,"Not what I was expecting, but still interesting","If you are looking for a book full of quick mental magic gags, this isn't very good. All the tricks in this book require either A) Advanced skills in slight of hand (palming, quick switches, etc) or B) A gimmicked apparatus. It isn't as easy as amazing your buddies at a party with some mind reading tricks. These are for more advanced magicians. It was also written in 1944.That being said, it is a very interesting look into how some of this stuff is (or was) accomplished. I have seen several of these tricks used before and wondered how they were pulled off, now I know.If you are a magician with basic skills in slight of hand, palming, and switching, then you will probably find some cool additions to your performance here.If you are looking for some basic stuff to baffle your friends with, this is not the right book for you."
5,Not American,"Kathleen plays in the Galway style, definitely NOT in a Sligo style. Although she lived in the states she does not have that fake American/Irish style that is so easy to hear with all of the American players. This is a trad album through and through, with some real gems of tunes. Throw out your Martin ""rubber band"" Hayes albums and learn from this. You won't go wrong."
4,Nice anti chlorine soap,This product has worked fairly well for me in containing swimmers itch in a pool
4,Durdy Game,This is a compelling drama that is an earnest depiction of how the sexes can betray each other. What sets this film apart from the rest is that it is based on a true chain of events. The lead characters are well developed and definitively identifiable. They are modeled after women that many of us know. These elements give the events of the movie a deeper feeling of reality that other films in its genre lack.The menus on the DVD are highly stylized and I loved the addition footage. This is another element of the DVD that sets it apart from its competition. When it is all said and done this is one of the best stories of the power of karma in recent years. Viewers may quite possibly think twice about committing their next &#65533;durdy&#65533; action. Thumbs UP!
3,Good Movie you have to give it a chance!!!,This movie is not for everyone. But you want a realistic perspective of what goes on these days check it out. It has a good plot and a even better ending.
3,"The Blackwood Brother, The Family of God",Much older Blackwood Brother's music than anticipated. Still good to have for collectors of the Blackwood Bros music.
4,Basic manual blood pressure monitor,"This is a very basic manual blood pressure monitor, no bells and whistles. It appears to be accurate. I have compared blood pressure readings with other manual and automatic monitors, and they continue to be the same (or close to the same). I like that it is self-contained with the attached stethoscope. It helps with proper placement on the arm. I should note that I have been taking blood pressures for the last 20+ years, so ease of use is more natural for me. However, when I showed my dad how to use this monitor, it was not as easy for him. He preferred an automatic inflate blood pressure monitor, and never wanted to use this monitor again."
5,His wit and humor match his writing talent,"Of course this book is inspirational, but to view this memoir as another tale of overcoming obstacles is selling it short. If you take away the subject matter, and judge the writing itself--you'll find an extraordinarily well-written, incredibly witty, and extremely funny book from a writer that has a gift for story telling. Ryan Knighton's intelligence leaps off the page and engages the reader in thought-provoking discussions. He managed to make me laugh out loud as well as cry, and to effectively do both is no easy task. His introspection and fresh, intelligent take on blindness and its effect on his life (and those around him) is insightful and profound. I look forward to reading his next book, regardless of the topic, because I so enjoyed his writing style. His students are learning from a master."
2,"I love the boys version, but not this one...","I really expected much better from this devotional. I also purchased the boys version and it has some really great lessons for my boy AND girl. This one is rather boring and I didn't like it nearly as much. I would like to recommend it, but I can't.Bottom Line: I would recommend the boys version over this one - even for girls."
2,Find a different book,"I recently rediscovered this book, buried in a stack of French literature books in my library! Alas, I can see why we set it aside years ago. It simply doesn't do its job. For a ""simple"" intro for children, it is in places much too complex and hard to read, and the illustrations are terrible. They may be ""stylish"" but they don't convey the ideas and make it hard to visualize how the pieces move.Find another book. Even though this one is available on the used market, in hardcover, for under five dollars with shipping, it just won't do what you want, which is help teach chess to your child.An alternative is the venerable 1948 classic by Edith Weart called ""The Royal Game: Chess for Young People."" I learned from it as a first grader way back when, and it can't be beat; even though used copies run around $20 or so, it's worth it."
2,I didn't think I could be disappointed by an Irish fiddler...,"...but I found this profoundly disappointing. I'm playing it again as I write this to confirm my opinion. I have always liked all types of Irish music, and in particular Irish fiddle (and I have been taking fiddle lessons, at an advanced age, for a couple years now, and really enjoying it, except for the fact that it is SOOO damn hard!). Gavin plays quite fast, with a sing-song rythem (sp?) that eliminates the luscious melodic quality of these Irish tunes. If one compares Gavin's playing to Martin Hayes, who can take the simplest tune and play it with such feeling that it makes you want to cry out-there is just no comparison. Forgo this and get a copy of Hayes' LIVE IN SEATTLE."
2,Poor design of otherwise great product,"I was excited to find these oval racks, but when they arrived, I was amazed to see that the rim is ABOVE the surface of the rack, so you can't slide food or pans on and off, as you can with other racks. What were they thinking? If they'll correct this flaw, I'll come back, as the material is heavy and nicely coated."
4,Cultural clash equals riveting suspense.,"Susan Dodd will make your head spin with the two dissimilar voices she uses in The Mourner's Bench. One is a southern woman raised in modest circumstances; the other is a New England academic to the manor born. Past trauma drove William from Leandra, but now dying, he comes seeking her at her isolated cabin in North Carolina where she's a doll maker. Their reunion is awkward at first, but there's the delicious prospect that they might finally come to love each other at last.More than the sum of its parts, The Mourner's Bench is a small book for women readers of all ages."
1,"selfish, cruel humans","Not much different than confining animals in a zoo to be looked at and used at the whim of humans. The Dutchers created a false environment to ""study"" wolves and help the species. Then what? Their wonderful, trusting, loving wolf pack is going to die, as the Dutchers say, ""they are just memories now"". This couple used these wonderful creatures and then moved on to their Today Show interviews, etc. etc.Putting up a fence? Dragging in food? Leaving? I agree with the other reviewers: this was a very sad mockumetary. Very sad."
5,Keeping me busy,"I have had one of the first edition copies of this book in my toolbox for years. When I showed my new third edition around, I had to order back for 6 more copies. I am back today to order four more. Everyone who sees it wants one. That says it all."
2,will the real Jeff Gordon please stand up....,"As expected, Jeff only lets us see what he wants us to see. A guarded and unimpressive memoir. Didn't expect the real thing, did you? If that's what you want, don't read. Too much at stake for Jeff to do that."
1,multi use ladder,I was using this import ladder on a platform when the lock on one side failed. I am only 170lbs. My paint and me went everywhere. Do yourself a favor and get the u.s. made ladder. I did and now I am happy - the US made ladder is a great product.
4,Happy with ladder,"This seems like a strong, versatile ladder. I moved into a new place and needed a tall ladder for outdoors and a short ladder for indoor use. This ladder can do both.The instruction sheet says ANSI type 2 duty rating, 225 LB Working Load and EN-131 Maximum Permissable Load 330 LBS. I have seen more expensive ladders in the store rated for less weight, and they were not adjustable.As others have said, the instructions are not great, but using the ladder is much easier than the instructions make it out to be. Just follow your common sense. The moving parts are quite self-explanatory."
1,leaves odor and stuffy air,"I bought this for my son's dust allergies. The carbon pre-filter leaves a strange odor. The filter does well at removing dust and allergens, but it seems to also remove available oxygen. It left my son's room so stuffy that he couldn't breathe. So the machine is just sitting in our closet. We found that shampooing the carpet, and vacuuming several times per week thereafter, did the best job at eliminating my son's discomfort due to dust. BTW, the HEPA air filter is not listed on this page and costs $80 and now, according to Hunter, lasts only 3-6 months, not one year."
2,Different from the description,"I got this in March 25,When I opened the package and see what's inside the book,IT WAS ALL WRONG!The one i was expected is the 1987 version which is clearly written on the description.I am not sure why Amazon packed the wrong one for me,or maybe it is my fault because I didn't read the description?BUT THE DESCRIPTION IS CLEARLY WRITTEN THERE 1987 VERSION!I am not sure that i could return this book back and get the 1987 version...."
4,Great PPV!!!!,"Rey Mysterio VS Kurt AngleGood match with a interesting beginning and middle.****Ric Flair VS Chris jerichoKinda Boring, but ok.**Edge VS Eddie GuerreroGreat match with a lot of action.*****Tag team ChampionshipLance Storm & Christioan VS Booker T & GoldustPretty decent matchup with Test interfering.***Intercontinental ChampionshipChris Benoit VS RVDThis was an action packed math with a lot of special moves.***Undertaker VS TestGreat match especially when Taker kicks out of big boot and does the toomstone.*****Non Sanctioned MatchShawn Michaels VS Triple HBest match on this PPV.

3,one of da best ppv of 2002,"key vs rey okaywhat can i say it was kid and play a house partay it was moves after moves in 9 mins u can bet that this match due 2 its length gets **** match easily if it went for another 5 to ten mins it could have been a moty contenderhbk vs hhhvery good street fight match that lived up to it hype to showcase that hbk is still da showstopper moves perform by hbk reminded me of da past of how good he use to be in the ring the match was a **** but i think i like kurt vs rey a little better than this match but not by too muchvery good summerslam this year like all the summerslams usually are my name is joe brown from harlem,nyc 1 of da biggest wwe fans u will ever hear from expect 2 c a lot of reveiws from me my friendze"
1,Another bungled PPV from WWE,"I honestly can't work out why this PPV has gotten such glowing reviews. The whole thing is one long, dated, predictable bore. Whether it's Undertaker squashing Test, Brock lesnar's heatless push reaching its climax, or Booker T being ""taught a lesson"" yet again, this whole show was just another nail in the coffin of good professional wrestling. Recommend avoiding this one."
1,"Interesting tales, but a third-hand view of India","Paine tells engaging stories about Curzon, Besant, Forster, Naipaul, Isherwood, Mirra Richard. But these are 2nd hand stories, and they are stories that reflect India another step removed. In itself the book is fine, but it fails to live up to the promise in the title. Paine should have looked at Thoreau, Emerson, Schopenhauer, Schrodinger for more direct influences. Or even if he chose this frame, the least he needed was to understand `Father India' for himself. If he had, a lot of rhetorical questions he asks in the book from time to time would have yielded their answers. Where is the tiger in the jungle? to repeat Hesse's old question. Since Paine doesn't know, his stories rank at the level of an English professor spinning yarns not about a subject directly, but about the lives of various people who dealt with it!"
3,Good Movie,I just finished watching this movie today. I like how it shows the different relationships in her life. I also found the fantasies funny she really over thinks everything in her life.
5,Wide floppy brim,"I wanted a sun hat with a wide floppy brim, and this one has it. I wear a hat every day when we take a walk, and in the hot weather, it needs to be cool, light and keep the sun off. This hat is all of that. It is more of a natural raffia color than the photo here - a little lighter in color. Even though the hat is crushable, it goes right back to the original shape. The paper fiber is lighter in weight than a straw hat. I like this hat very much."
2,Brim Too Small,"This hat was okay, but I didn't like the 5 inch brim. It was smaller than I expected. I sent them back and bought 8 inch brimmed hats instead."
3,Uncertain,"I received the cough drops I ordered in a timely manner, but they have no expiration date on them. An inquiry to the company went unanswered."
3,Did I learn?,"Lean to learn how to learn, did I learn how to learn? Well i bought the book for my daughter to help her learn the importance of learning. She still needs to learn, so learning from this book only helped her learn a little about learning."
4,Engaging.,"Most everyone knows about Rosa Park's show of courage that helped spark the civil-rights movement, but few will probably know of the experiences in her formative years that helped shape her opinions and influenced her character. The Rosa Parks Story reveals the woman behind the legend. Not only is this gripping viewing, but would be of great educational benefit to a younger audience who may not be so familiar with this important period of 20th century history. Angela Bassett, in the starring role, is excellent - she emanates a warmth but also a gracful sort of stoicism that is entirely captivating. Also of interest is Rosa's relationship with her husband, who, at first was unapproving of her association with the NAACP and of her desire to bring about justice. His feelings, of course change, and there is quite a moving sequence in which this is illuminated.On the whole, this movie is well worth investigating."
5,A Solid Debut Album,"This album was probably not given much attention when it was released in 2002. I didn't hear about it til almost 10 years later. But now, I can't stop listening to it. Solid mix of funk, jazz, rock, and comedic lyrics. A must have."
2,Very disappointing work from a good author,"I have several Michael Janich books and DVD's, all except this one are great. This one is really crap.In this book, there was no real depth. All of the items he shows how to build ANYONE with ANY imagination at all could build. There isn't any craftsmanship, or even clever ideas to the equipment shown in the book. An example: the heavy bag construction was buying an old army duffle bag, then putting old carpet padding in it, which would create a bag weighing roughly 10lbs with absolutely no firmness for striking.None of the equipment would not hold up to the abuse of hard training and most wouldn't last through an 8 year old girls pillow fight."
2,Books three and four perhaps the weakest of the series,"The remember really enjoying the first four books of the Cheysuli Chronicles the first time I read them as a teenager.After the omnibus editions came out I re-read the first four so that I could continue on to (previously unread) books five through eight. That, however, might have been a mistake, as I almost gave up, I was so disgusted with the perpetually cycling dynastic plot. Just too many unfulfilled romances, unwilling crown princes and altogether too much holier-than-thou Cheysuli arrogance.Books one and two are great, and the series gets better, but books three and four are, IMHO, the weakest of the Cheysuli Chronicles."
2,Not a lot to it,"This game is a kind of blend of Space Harrier, Gauntlet, with fps influences. It's not that interesting in any department. Once you've played through level one you've just about seen all it has to offer. Gameplay boils down to holding down the strafe and shoot buttons. The special weapons aren't that useful. The small nuclear bomb is just a key that materializes right in front of the door you have to use it on, it's kind of funny the first time, that's about it. You have a sniper rifle and a parachute but the level design doesn't use them to full effect. Character design is mostly boring, just a naked guy spray painted black, the helmet is kind of interesting in sniper mode with the HUD and Darth Vader sound effect. Enemy designs generally look like fluctuating polygons, the game runs too fast most of the time to tell what they are. Platforming sections are harder than they need to be because the controls and physics aren't that good, you can phase right through some platforms."
2,Not much of a story,"First, let me tell you that I saw the movie ""Cracks"" before I read the book. Maybe that was mistake because I thought the movie was so-so and wanted to give the book a try. It was disappointing and the story itself proved never convincing. Also, I found the people in the story not very developed at all. Usually it's possible to make great stories out of a school context since the setting of school as a place with many different events is something everyone can relate to. Also, the plot is not setting. Most of the times a whole group of people are referred to as ""we"". I thought it could have been a story but sadly I cannot recommend it."
5,Extremely suspenseful,"I read this book in one gulp. It is extremely suspenseful. The use of the first person plural to tell the story was original, and I loved the character Sheila Kohler!"
2,Great presentation but little content.,"I was a bit disappointed when the comprehensive guide of MacGyver's feats I expected showed up to my door as a book no bigger than a typical magazine. With less than 40 tricks - many a high school student could figure out just by watching the show - the handbook only skims the surface of what MacGyver could (or couldn't possibly) do. On the other hand, if you have an extra 20 bucks lying around, these guys really know how to make a fan chuckle."
4,great game minor technical difficulties,i can get up to the last level of the game yet cannot beat it however i think it's a great game
5,Funny!,"I am a twenty-three year old, and received this book as a stress-busting gift. Needless to say, I had never laughed so hard reading a ""children's book"". The author's way with language and illustrations is amazing; it even made me wonder why there weren't books like this when I was growing up.Regarding those parents who are concerned for the literary quality of the ""Captain Underpants"" series, I can only say that kids need to have a balance in their ""reading diet"". The important thing is to get them excited about reading!"
5,You'll read parts of it again and again. Superb!,"From a brilliant essay on Melville to great book reviews to presenting the works of other writers (such as Yevtushenko), this volume is entertaining, enlightening, and wonderful."
4,Phone Case,"The case is excellent and for the price cant be beat. Shipping was slow, but that was due more to the postal service than the company. Definitely worth the money."
3,Should Have Been A Short Story,I gave this book three stars basically because it kept me interested enough to finish it. The plot was very thin and I just could not connect with the characters. Plotlines dropped off so you never found out where they were going. Some things insinuated which should have just been said. Ending told in a kooky kinda screenplay fashion.
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"When researching this product and reading the opinions of other customers, the product was heralded for children of all ages. As a matter of fact, the number of older children with whom this product was successful caught my eye. The set-up and theme of the story is extremely preschool, a baby elephant who has difficulty carrying pails of water. As a parent of an older child with enuresis, this is inappropriate."
1,Not worth your time or money.,"The very basic, core concept of balanced combat within the game has been broken since launch. Now, after a year of patches and fixes, the combat system is even more broken. Players are very upset and the community is leaving in droves. I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone as SOE (the publisher) have continually lied to the players saying ""we're working on it"" while in reality, the whole development team has been working on the expansion instead. SOE doesn't care about the game, or whether or not its fun to play. They're just interested in earning as much as possible. Play at your own risk."
1,"If SWG is so broken, how can this be any better","You've read it in the other reviews, so I'll not waste much space recovering what others have stated. The game this expansion requires is currently broken in several key areas. This expansion is being pushed out WAY too quickly BEFORE things are scheduled to be fixed with the original game. As a result, you'll have some cool ships and be able to fly...but broken quests, loot, combat, PvP and PvE, levelling, and most importantly, the lack of content will force you to regret your purchase. I'd wait if I were you, and check back later. For now, all you'll be getting is a glorified IRC client."
2,Do NOT buy this expansion.,"This expansion is given as a FREE download to ALL players, now. Do not pay for this expansion."
1,sorry,I may have done this twice but I am not sure. Anyway. This game is makeing the original into a big stink pickle. SInce you have to buy the origianl to play this one I would advise against it. Sometime next year when the game gets fixed you may want to try it. But given the current SWG track recored expect JTL to be ubnbalanced and full of promises that may someday eventually get fixed.
5,Relive the Days of Xwing Versus Tie Fighter,"This Exspansion Promises to relive the Days of Xwing Vs Tie Fighter in a MMORPG Setting. Its a dream come true to us players who enjoyed the Space fighting days.Current people reviewing have done so in a very immature fashion. They are a Minority in a Game with 500,000 Subscriptions. They feel cheated cause as a minority they arent getting thier way so want to try and do a smear campaign.This Game is fun. The Devs have Said from day one a big challange will be to make content for yourself too. They always release Publishes each month with new content but some people are whiny and Impatient.Buy the original and Definetly buy the Exspansion. Its gonna be a Blast and maybe ill see you in space to blast you.Alec of Bloodfin"
5,The Bible of survey design and execution,"If the survey world has a rock star, it's Don Dillman. In this tome, Dillman shares his wisdom with any and all willing to learn at his feet. What is particularly nice about this edition is that it changes with the times - extensive attention is paid to survey methods utilizing the possibilities offered by the internet.Am I being melodramatic when I say that this book will make all of your survey dreams come true? Of course I am. It's a book on surveys, and yeah, some of the reading is dry. But in terms of the applicability of the lessons shared in the book, there's no better resource."
5,Fun to the last piece,"Overall I've been very amused by this game. Games included were chess, checkers, chinese checkers, pachsi, dominoes, backgammon, mancala, snakes & ladders, zen bones, reversi, line 'em up, plane racer, and battling ships (AKA battleship with awesome screen effects). Some characters were annoying but I liked the T-Rex a lot. The ability levels were pretty good. Great screen effects and nice background music."
2,Take a chill pill,"Ok. So it isn't the greatest test of playstation power. But if you had a copy of ""Aero the Acrobat"" or ""Zero the Kamakazi Squirrel"", then you've played a game about the same level of garaphics and fun. Comparing Punky to things like Spyro or Final Fantasy is hardly fair. As a game to just have fun, it accomplishes it's goal. It *is* worth the shipping if you have the spair time. I played and won the game, and quite frankly, those of you who didn't are just too scared of it's difficulty level."
3,Damaged book,"The book came packed with another item I purchased and I was greatly disappointed that the other product had been jammed into the book and half the pages were bent, the back cover almost torn in two. I had planned on giving this book to our retirement home library, but knew I could not do that with the damage incurred. Also, the bent pages and back cover made the book uncomfortable to hold, so I didn't finish reading it."
5,Outstanding,Have used this for 3 years now and it has always worked fine. Great color accuracy and excellent scans. The unit has been very reliable .
4,useful BP checking machine,this is really a very handy product. easy to use and carry. i bought it for my mother. the accuracy might not be high but is good enough for regular monitoring.
2,Faulty product,"I purchased a Mark of Fitness digital blood pressure monitor, and when I received it, the unit was faulty. I called customer srvice and they were very good about allowing me to return the product. I received my refund plus postage in a short time. Thanks to customer service department. I make several purchases a year and this one was the first return. Amazon is a good site to use for any purchases needed. Thanks again."
5,Exactly i need,"I buy this because i have a heart problem and its perfect, easy of use and understand, with one touch you can know your heart conditions."
1,A completely waste of money,I have been using this for several weeks and the readings are not correct at all. I have taken it to my doctor and compare with his measurement: this device is completely wrong. DO NOT BUY IT. It is a completely waste of money.
3,"Stilted by ""Political Correctness""","The translation's a little stilted by political correctness (""Child of Humanity"" instead of ""Son of Man,"" for instance), but it's an interesting read because it's just the material, without editorializing."
3,Useful resource,"This is a great resource that finally lets people see for themselves what the Gnostic writings are about: blathering nonesense removed from historical context. These writings would not inspire an elementary student of religion. They reveal a totally different religion that did not inspire the majority of it's readers. These books went out of circulation long before Christianity was legal. There was no power structure in place, only the plain sense of average people who said, ""What?"" when they read these and ""Wow!"" when they read the first four gospels, written more than 100 years earlier. I'm glad to finally be able to see for myself that all the hoopla is just that. This version is readable and accurate."
5,REIGNS OVER ALL,"Four of the more intriguing Gnostic gospels are found here. Translated by a premeire theologian, Marvin W. Meyer lays out these gospels in a smooth and flowing style which is both enlightening and a pleasure to read. Included are some very in-depth notes and a most exhaustive bibliography. ""Let one who seeks not stop seeking until one finds. When one finds, one will be disturbed. When one is disturbed, one will be amazed, and reign over all."" -from The Gospel of Thomas"
2,Run Angel Run,Definitely not the movie that I thought that I was getting. This will be a watch it once and not recommend that any of my guests watch as they will be disappointed.
1,This game ...,"This game is one of the worst games I have ever played on any game system. The graphics are pitiful. There is virtually no point to this game. You set traps to kill your enemies...oh, gee that sounds like fun FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. Rent this game before you even consider buying it at any price. It is a total yawn."
3,"fancy, but didn't work","I guess the baby needs training, and lots of hours slept in this cot, to get used to it. We carried it with us across oceans and impressed relatives with how fancy it is, but our baby did not sleep a single night in it. In the end, the clunky car seat ended up being a bed as well, and that was all we should have taken with us."
3,"Anti-climactic for me, but fun for my son!","My son loves his volcano...Just know that it takes about 24 hours before you can have your first ""eruption,"" so that you can tell your child in advance. When you do do set it up for an eruption, just know that it won't be that dramatic...it will sort of sputter and spit and foam. But you know what, my kid didn't have the same expectations as I did and he was not disapponted, except that it took 24 hours to use!"
4,volcano,This is a fun project to make with kids. It is really simple and doesn't require alot of time. It is durable and you can explode the volcano as many times as you want. Clean up is easy just rinse off the volcano. Best if used as an outdoor activity since the vinegar smells bad and it makes a mess.
3,volcano,Bought this last year dont know why im revewing this nowif your kids like science go buy it for them
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"This movie is hilarious. My only complaint is that they only attend 1 Judas Priest concert and only capture about 20 minutes (however, the footage is priceless). There are some other great features on the DVD (my favorite being ""Neil Diamond Parking Lot"") and it's definitely worth the buy if you're into mocking the dregs of civilization."
2,"Frustrating to follow, overly verbose,","I ordered this book hoping the first two reviewers were overly pessimistic, but boy were they right. This book has terriffic potential, but Travis does not stick to the chosen topic well enough, mixing material covered in different layers. It's a good thing I saw this and could overlook it...pity the novice hoping to make some sense of the SS7 structure. There's way too much verbage and not nearly enough illustrations and real-world examples. After finishing the book, I felt I was presented with a ""gob"" of information and a very weak understanding of it's true structure. On the plus side, it's probably the best textbook on the subject, but that speaks stongly to the need for another book, or major re-write."
1,How Odd,It's hard to describe this odd little book. But that was my reaction when I was through reading it: How odd! That's really all I can say.
5,Excellent Racket!,"PROS:100% Control100% Speed100% SpinIts almost Perfect!!!CONS:The Weight... Its a little heavy, that the average"
4,hot racket,"It took one outing to get used to it, but it's made a big difference in my game. My spins have much more bite."
2,Not what I expected,"The paddle itself is good for the money, but the rubber started to deteriorate after a couple of matches, the top edge was very fragile and it started to break off, I don't mean, peeling, I mean the rubber was separating from itself."
4,"Great raquet, even for intermediate players!","I consider myself an intermediate player. I don't know if I am at the level where the raquet makes a difference already, but with this raquet I am able to give and counter spins much more easily, so i am a fan. I'll do what other people say and be sure to clean it after each session to keep the spin quality as long as I can."
2,Not the quality I expected,"This cover set is cheap, in all aspects. Too small even for my forged blade iron. I'd rather spend several more dollars for a better quality one."
4,Wilson Golf Neoprene Iron Covers,These covers fit snug and prevents my clubs from getting scratched. Look nice. I don't need my glassed to find the numbers.
4,Very Fast-Paced Action,"The Mechwarrior series of games is on of the best on PC. This translation to Playstation does a pretty good job. The graphics are decent and the sound is phenomenal with a great soundtrack that really gets the blood pumping. The two different ways you can go through the game are fun, and the difficulty levels add a lot of challenge. It would have been nice to have a two player, head-to-head option.This is definitely a fun game that will always have replay value."
4,Great carrier for small dogs,We bought this carrier for my mother-in-law who probably would not be able to carry her dog in a typical carrier. The wheels on this make it so easy for her to use. Her dog loved being wheeled around in it. The mesh on the top and sides make the dog feel secure and comfortable. The only downfall was that the brace on the sides is supposed to be kept in place by little pieces of velcro but they come undone easily.
5,A great way to socialize your puppy,"Purchased this for my new grand""puppy"". My daughter is thrilled with it, but puppy doesn't like the confinement."
4,nice item,"just wish that the color was more accurate between the picture and when I got the item in person. The carrier works great for carrying both of my chihuahuas around in (one is 5 pounds, the other is 8). they fit right next to each other comfortably. Only took off 1 star for the color and the fabric of the bag has a certain texture to it that looks like its an older piece even though it came in brand new. If you're looking for something to conveniently carry your small dog in, this works great to switch from carrying them on your back or pulling them along with the wheeling part."
3,Pros and cons,"Looks like a nice carry on suit case... And easy to wheel through the airports or wear on your back.They sent me green, not black.... It is very small (and my dog is only 7lbs) and the pieces meant to keep the bag from collapsing never stay in place. Bought in April and the zipper is busted already."
5,i love it,"it is good to fly with, and good to walk with. the dog need to be small and you should put a pillow for it inside."
3,Not an item to used as a hand me down!,We bought this item for my daughter 4 years ago and it worked great! It really helped in getting her to go to sleep on her own in her room without me rocking her. I loved the remote that we hung on the outside of her door that made it easy to reactivate the aquarium if she began to get fussy without her wanting me to pick her up.The only thing that is disappointing about this item is that we planned on using it for our second child and we cannot. Half of the water has somehow evaporated out after 2 years of being kept in storage in the basement. It could probably still be used but the bubbles don't have the same affect anymore.
4,Calming & Pleasant!,"This aquarium plays great lullabies that are soothing and not annoying, especially since it will run over and over for about 20 minutes or so before shutting off. Some of the songs include.. Braham's Lullaby, Twinkle Twinkle, Pachabel's canon...plus there are ocean & bubble sounds if you need just white noise! The moving bubbles and lights captivate my daughter for at least another 20 minutes.One important thing is that the straps aren't very long, so it only attached to the head of her crib, and it was too short to fit the crib on the sides (which would have been more ideal for her to see). I warn you if you have a crib that has has more angled & thick ledges, as ours does. For example, the lip of the crib is approx 4-5 inch wide. Also, the directions say that the aquarium needs to be at least 6 inches above the mattress. Take that into consideration...we had to have our mattress set lower to accommodate the aquarium."
5,Ocean Wonders Aquarium,Our baby has used this since two months old in her crib at bedtime and naps she is entertained by it until she falls asleep. Prefers the sound of the ocean over the music. Great product.
5,Son's Favorite Night time toy,"I bought this product when my son was 3 months old to try and get him to sleep alone. While he didn't take to it at first within a few months he enjoyed it a lot. Then he figured how to turn it on/off himself (first using his feet and then his hands) and now its a bonified hit. It is also very durable because my son, now 9 months, frequently kicks it very hard, hits the button, lifts it and drops it with his feet, and uses it to pull up and change the music himself. So, for the low price I paid (I paid half of what it is listed here now)it stands up to a very strong 9 month old and keeps working.I would highly recommend this product. Oh, and don't be silly like my husband and I and read the directions because we had no idea there were many more songs until my son changed it himself. LOL"
3,"OK, not as good as some others","We have the jungle one for our daughter and picked this one specifically because of the remote feature. This way our daughter can turn it on for the baby. Funny side note, if you have a Sony TV, the volume control will turn the unit on and off...To be honest the jungle one is nicer....But it will do...."
4,Ocean Wonders Aquarium,"Overall the toy/mobile is great. However, it would have been nice to have the option not to play the music and only use the night light."
5,Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium,"I bought this item for my grand niece, and her mother said that Haillie was drawn to it right away. It fits on the inside of a crib, and has several colours, movements of 'fish', and tunes to listen to. My niece also said that this item was very soothing to her baby, and helped her to fall asleep at night and for her naps during the day."
4,good clean fun,"When I first discovered this one, I almost jumped on it. The Magazine (Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition) itself is almost never to be found in Germany, so this seemed to be the perfect alternative. And don't get me wrong: it's worth every penny, but: the picture quality changes a great deal throughout the book. Some are so good, it makes you cry - others are rather poor blow-ups from the magazine. I would have assumed that with all the production-value that you have here (hardcover, nice binding, dust-jacket etc.) the editors could have done more to exclude pictures with the above-mentioned problems. Another thing: do not expect too many pictures from before 1990, the subtitle ""five decades of swimsuit photography"" seems a bit misleading.All in all: high production-value, many rather exciting PG-pictures of beautiful women on the beach and very few disappointments concerning picture quality."
4,Short and Dirty,"Ian - good effort, showing his years.Billy - you don't have to move when you look that cool.Matt - is always awesome. You can tell the guy loves rock.Others - round it out to make one great sounding live DVD despite sketchy vocals.Tip - turn Ian down in the center channel so he isn't so out front. The vocals are better when you tuck them some. Then rock out. Who knew a Matchless amp could be that thick?"
2,What happened to the energy,Do not buy this dvd if you love Ian's voice. He seems to be totally out of it. Stoned cold wasted or whatever.
5,Excellent blocks,"Our boys have played with these for years. We bought when they were 2, and at 6, beat up and some crushed from being jumped upon, they are still going strong. They still build mega-building with them for their lego and playmobil characters and toy armies. They'll last a few more years both in durability and in kid's interest level."
4,"A fun, versatile and educational toy","My 16 month old currently likes to stack and knock over these blocks but, I'm hoping he'll get more creative in building with them as he gets older. The 24 piece set may not be enough blocks for versatile play so, a bigger set or an additional set is reccomended. Also, you have to put the blocks together but, I actually enjoyed doing so."
2,Corded phone,"The phone looks great, however, looks can be deceiving. The handset hasan annoying echo and you cannot adjust the volume. There are settings onthe handset for volume - high or low. The volume is actually loud andvery loud. This phone got great reviews and that's why I purchased it.I may have to look for another brand - because now I'm afraid all the NWBell products may be the same"
1,The author failed to explain the basics of financial acct.,This book constantly asks reader to jump back and forth between chapters. It failed to present a general picture of financial accounting. The author did not organize his ideas well. Do not choose to read this book if you are new to accounting.
4,SARK Rules!,"Another wonderful book by SARK to help you through this crazy thing called life. The title is a little deceiving--as it isn't mainly about money, but about continuing her ongoing themes of self acceptance, self-love, and inspiration. Her books in general are easy to read and to relate to, and this book is no different. Possibly her most in-depth book to date, it delves deep into our sense of abundence in all aspects of our lives. This book has stayed with me for weeks and I keep taking sips of it like good tea to replenish my energy and inspiration."
1,Irritating is right,"This game is AWFUL! I mean, the announcer is irritating enough. The game's inane object of guiding a dot through a little track with some obstacles in it is enough to make you curious, and you might have a couple minutes of fun trying something different, but it gets old FAST. I got to level 3 and just turned it off. [Bad] graphics don't make it easy on the eyes either."
5,Great!,"I recieved this movie from LA to North Carolina in 3 days so the shipping was great, the companys great everything just all around great!"
1,Dear Loveless John,"The following is the story of Dear John: Boy meets girl. Girl is like an angel - if leeches were angels and angels fed off of people with issues. Boy has freaky dad. Dad collects a bunch of coins and then dies. Boy writes girl a bunch of letters (see the Notebook). Girl reads letters and writes back. Girl marries another guy with cancer, leeching off of his suffering until he is dead. Boy returns. They have a dinner and.... The end. I just saved you two hours! Two hours void of any love. Light some candles and dump a bucket of chicken on your dinner table - FAR more romantic. You're welcome."
1,Dear John Movie Awful,"Dear John sucked. Literally, it was just horrible. Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried's acting was actually quite good. It was the story that ruined it. It was, to say the least, incomplete, monotonous, predictable, and just plain bad. There were so many avenues that the movie showed but didn't take,. Like, John's past or his fathers illness. Savannah's past. I felt like this whole movie was just their letters being read. I usually love Nicholas Sparks novels, and sappy, predictable, lovey dovey stories but even for me, this one was just awful. If you are considering watching it, do yourself a favor and DONT! Don't waste 2 hrs of your life on it. Trust me."
4,Really worth a watch,"I watched this movie entirely by accident - I found it while scrolling through my Dish network program list - I watched if for a few seconds and was hooked almost instantly. Sure the script is schmaltzy in parts - but Channing Tatum was completely believable as John and the story carried me away! There was definite chemistry on screen between the two young actors and Channing has leading man written all over him - that being said contrary to some of the other reviews, the boy can act. There is a scene where he reads a letter to his father in the hospital and begins to cry - it was so touching and heartfelt - I defy anyone to watch that scene without tearing up themself! If you are looking for a sweet love story, this is a good one - bring your hankies and turn down the lights - Dear John will deliver and is watchable over and over again!"
4,I liked this movie.,"I'm a huge Tatum Channing fan, and long before Magic Mike or the sexiest man alive things. I think he is an actor to watch in the future. Not only does he have ""box office"" qualities he has real star possibilities with his acting."
4,O.K. not great,"Overall good movie. Acting wooden at times, plot drags at times. Wait to buy until it hits the bargain bins."
5,Dear John,Arrived a lot earlier than I expected. I haven't watched the movie because it's a give for a friend but I've been satisfied with this business before.
3,"It's Ok, but Not Impressive","the best thing to do is WATCH the movie First, Then READ the Book, if not, you won't enjoy the movie...i read the Book and it was amazingly insane, it was perfect, incredible..but the movie wasn't impressive..not worth it, the book is #1"
4,Romantic,"Good Movie...not fantastic but good. The acting at points could have been better, plot worked...slow for an action movie lover, timeline a little jumbled toward the end, but very much more enjoyable for the fact that it doesn't glamorize the war nor churn into a typical left wing anti-war monger propaganda movie. The extras explain a lot more with behind the scenes and research into the film."
2,Did Anyone Else Find it Tedious,"This X game was just tedious. I remember the original X game on the SNES was fun, as were X2 and X3, but this one was just bad. Playing as X or Zero was fun, but Zero was hard to control and both storylines were, well, boring. I was almost to the point of yawning. Plus, it was easy to figure out who the final boss was for anyone who has ever played an X game. Additionally, some of the upgrades to Xs armor made him harder to operate, and, well, I guess what I really want to say is this was boring. I was bored stiff. I couldn't wait to beat it so I could move on to something else. Unlike X, X2 and X3, there is almost no replay value in this game. I mean, beyond the cheat codes for the special X armor and Dark Zero, nothing. I only hope that X5 and X6 are better, but I'm not sure if they will be."
1,I HATE THIS GAME,"This review is hard to write because I am so mad that I wasted my money on this game. Oh whoopie, you can play as Zero the fighter, butt zero is how much I should've payed for this game. There isn't one thing about this game that I like. The story [is bad] and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful. If you want a real game, don't waste your money on this. Don't even rent this game. This game is so bad it make Pong look good."
4,"4 and a half, really.","This game is really a lot of fun and is probably the best X game for the PS (X5 was too easy, and I haven't played X6 yet). This game has my favorite character from the X franchise, Zero, as a fully playable character. The cut scenes are well animated, but the dubbing is hideous. Even so, I had fun with it. I have beaten it with X, but I just can't quite do it with Zero. Zero is stronger than X, but also harder to control. Once you pick a character, you are him for the whole game. Of course, I did cheat, but who cares? Why not try without a cheat code next time. That's what made it easy. Here's hoping the best will happen for X7!"
5,One of my favorite games.,"Growing up, I played this game too much. I always play as Zero, mainly because when I play as X, I use his super suit and it's no fun. But I got this game and played over night and got to Sigma in 6 hours. And I haven't played this game in 9 years."
1,Waste of Time,"I agree with Jeffrey Weiss. Avoid this book. I caught two errors within the first four minutes. There is so little information it is not funny. The ONLY plus is the interview with Richard Matheson and even then I suspect that isn't of value considering the new Matheson biography that is coming out.The problem with books like these is the wide distribution the publishing company can afford. It gets reviewed in major magazines and unsuspecting people fall victim to the praise of major book reviewers.Take Jeffrey Weiss' advice and check out THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams Jnr. also available on Amazon.com which covers the entire series with 800 plus pages of behind-the-scenes trivia, exclusive interviews with cast and crew and a detail level will exceed anyone's expectation. If you are looking for a book that covers ""everything"" about the TV series, the Grams book is the one to invest."
5,she rocks more than Red Rocks,Stevie is timeless and anyone who can truly delve into the meaning of her lyrics is truly a fan. She's a cherished poetic goddess and God bless her.
1,If you want to see Stevie Nicks hammered on stage,"If you want to see Stevie Nicks hammered, get this. She's so smashed that the music is not even that enjoyable. Her backup singers do a much better job than she does. I feel sorry for them as they try and judge when she will break out into one her unnecessary vocal tangents. It even seems that the producers of this video had to cut out some embarrassing scenes where maybe she fell down or forgot the words. Do yourself a favor and stick with ""The Dance."""
5,"ROCK A LITTLE TOUR,Stevie at her best","One of the best rock concerts released on video in the late 80's,""Red Rocks"" features an hour of the 86 ""Rock A little"" tour,and Stevie Nicks belts out classics,album favorites,and proves she is,and will always be the Queen of Rock..."
4,Powerful performance,"There are no extra features on this DVD. But with Stevie Nicks' raw, powerful performance, who needs them? The majesty of Red Rocks and the passion of Stevie Nicks make for an unforgettable experience (and this DVD is way cheaper than tickets to her concert). My favorite songs on this DVD are the rockers - ""I Need to Know"", ""Stand Back"" and ""Edge of Seventeen"" - her emotion is always turned up to 11. Mick Fleetwood makes a cameo during ""Beauty and the Beast"". The white-winged dove that does not want to leave is a fine example of the powerful spirit and magnetism that is Stevie Nicks. Her fans know it well.This DVD is a must-have for the Nicks fan. It is timeless."
5,great cd,i never was a nivea fan until i discovered animalistic it is a good cd very much my taste in music it should have been out in the united states it would have sold a lot of copies i love this cd and the style of the cd so i say it is a great buy for anyone
4,Just a bit big,I like this product but it takes a bit of time to get it in. Once in gives you a full feeling but it can pop out if you walk around with it in.
3,It's okay,"Very flexible, definitely for a beginner. Bright color and the material is nice & smooth. Really, no complaints, works as intended..."
4,Secure seal,I assume this product was scientifically designed. If not then I would suggest increasing the length of the stem by 1/4 to 1/2 inch so the sphincter muscle could more easily secure the seal around the bulb end.
5,Wow!,"I originally ordered this guy, and it was so big, I decided on the medium one, which was the same size as one I've had forever.So Lots of lube and time, and was able to pop this guy in, but they need a size that is in between these 2 if you want to work up to it."
3,good book,"The book is an interesting read, but I didn't realize it was composed before the 5th book came out, which still makes it interesting because a lot of the kids guess what happens next and it is funny to see who gets it right! It took awhile for shipping, but I am in Hawaii, so that may be the reason!"
2,This slightly disappointed me,"The first two seasons came in nice boxed sets with bonus features. This season, however did not. It came on one dual sided DVD. Nothing else. Its just the show. The bonus features for this season are on the season 4 special features disk, which I wouldn't have known. Luckily I did order season 4 at the same time. This is my favorite season out of the whole show and I can't play the dual sided disks on my DVD player. Only my laptop. Its kind of a let down"
4,gamer since 1988,I wish capcom would have put much effort in Mega Man 8 as they did Mega man 7. But this is still a fun game with all the aime cut scenes.
5,Megaman Fanatic,I wake up at 7 in the morning to watch his show this game is awsome and when megaman is over i play his game alllllllll day long
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This is the worst megaman game I ever played. I am a fan of the X series and going from X to Megaman is a HUGE downsize. Megaman can't slide that far and he can't do the wall kick. His jumping ablity is the worst. Every time he jumps it's like it takes all he has just to jump. I beat this game in a couple of days, there is nothing hard about it, it's just annoying. I would suggest you just rent this one. And if you are a HARDCORE Megaman fan, then you should buy all the Megaman X series, but don't waste your time on this game."
3,"A few improvements, but much like all the others!","This game is really fun and all, especially for those who love all of the old Mega Man games ( such as myself) but I was kinda dissapointed. I expected it to have more bosses and levels. Just like all the old ones, you chose your opponent and then fight him and get his ability, then chose another untill you beat them all. It has been like this sense the first one came out! However it is fun!In this game, you can actually upgrade your wepons and stuff, but the graphics arn't that much better then the Netendo versions ( Although there is a cartoon in the begining). If you're looking for long gameplay hours, this is NOT the game to buy! If you're lookng for ""another Mega Man"" then I would recamend it."
4,Screw Ya'll I Like This Game,"It has bad graphics, but a good story. it's funny with bad excuses for horror scenes. but i'll warn you, prepare yourself for the scream when you fall to your death. Classic!"
2,Low quality and noisy- I don't know if they help allergy sufferers,"I have not yet washed these, and maybe my opinion will change with washing. After just opening these they seem ""disposable"" and thin. They are also very noisy each and every time you touch them. Forget about moving your head about on these. IF they do in fact help people with allergies then they are a great product, but I was really looking for some nice soft, washable pillow covers and these are not it. They remind me of the blue disposable shoe covers that doctors wear before going into surgery. Also, they do not look like the picture shown, they are darker (almost yellow) and striped."
1,"To be honest, I'd just rather not get cancer...","Though I didn't even open the package, the protectors looked as if they were made out of paper. The kicker was the sticker on the unopened product that reads ""California Law Requires This Warning: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."" Thanks, California!! You forever have my gratitude."
1,Doesn't work,The rack did not fit any of my neoprene dumbbells. Did not find this out until it was all assembled. Bummer. Not sure what the rack is for??Amazon was very good about authorizing a UPS pickup for a free return and a credit to my account.
3,Not the best of its kind,"I got this in the 80s in the wake of Simon's ""Graceland."" This is probably the best known collection of this kind in America. Overall, it's not a bad set, but there are better collections of this kind for the intiate of S/A music. These selections lack the proper mix of rhythm and melody to hook you the first time around. But Township Jive (S/A's equivalent to reggae and R&B), while an acquired taste that never caught on in the US as it should have, has excellent collections such as ""Rhythm of Resistance,"" ""Rough Guide to S/A Music,"" ""Rough Guide to S/A Jazz,"" ""Kings and Queens of Township Jive,"" etc. Try those first, then ork your way back to this one."
3,replica not real,the hoodie is a replica and i highly doubt that it is officially licensed as advertised. I say this because the ink and screen print are different than the ones i have on the hoodie i bought a coheed show. it is a good replica and hopefully the screen print doesn't wash off. best of luck to any other buyers.
1,Careful--He has people in his coaching firm write the reviews,"I saw this book on business coaching advertised in Entrepreneur magazine next to a large advertisement for Action Coaching--a franchise. Is it not strange that the names of each reviewer can be ""googled"" and most, if not all, are members of ""Action Coaching."" Evidently no one outside of his ""firm"" found the book worth reviewing. This smacks of unethical behavior--your subordinates and friends writing superlative remarks about your work.His books may be worthwhile...but I won't pad his pockets."
5,Get Results from Your Advertising,"Instant Advertising contains everything you need to know to create killers ads that won't break the marketing budget...The Author Bradley J Sugars takes you right back to the basic principles of writing a successful ad. When small business owners begin to design ads, they usually spend too much time trying to make their ads ""clever"" or ""cute,"" ultimately losing the sales message their advertisements should help deliver, says Sugars.Instant Advertising shows business owners how to avoid these common pitfalls and how to design ads that will increase sales and visibility.No business owners should advertise without reading Instant Advertising first..."
1,Save your money,"This book is a total waste of time. It is poorly written and pathetically staged. Cashing in on the Billie Jean and Michael Jackson link is total crap. Letters to Michael Jackson was also a waste of time, ink and paper."
1,HORRIBLE AND DISGUSTING,I GOT THIS MOVIE AND WAS COMPLETELY DISGUSTED WITH IT I MEAN I KNOW IT WAS A HORROR MOVIE BUT THERE WERE SOME THINGS IN THERE THAT REALLY SHOULDNT HAVE BEENWORST STORYLINE I HAVE EVER SEENAND SOME OF THE WORST ACTING AND VISUAL EFFECTSIF YOU RECIEVE THIS AS A GIFT I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND DESTROYING IT
2,Entire Movie is Set-up for Bad Punchline,"Whole movie is a set up to poke fun at the horror genre. That sounds good except the fact that it was done poorly and no part of this movie is interesting. I watched it with a friend whose sole reason for being there was making sure I didn't stop watching. After it was over he looked at me and began to laugh maniacally saying, ""NOW YOU HAVE SUFFERED THE PAIN THAT I HAVE SUFFERED."" The movie is really that bad."
4,easy to use,I really like this. Its simple to use and keeps a record of readings.Nice price too. Also the case make it easy to carry.
2,Not accurate,There seem to be some problem with the device. It is no where close to the accuracy. The distortion is in the range of +/- 10 units
2,Another with a bad display,Just like other reviewers I received one with a display gone bad.Amazon sent out a replacement quickly.Used a few times but does not seem that accurate- about 10 to 20 low.Thinking of sending back. My advise- spend your money on a more accurate device.
1,Don't buy it,This is not a good buy. The readings are not consistent. Two consecutive readings are 50 units different.
1,This product is waist of your money,"Hi,Every time I have taken the readings , I have got the supprising results , which no where match with the one while taken at the doctor.This is highly dependent on the position if your hand , accuracy is very less."
4,Good Product,"Buy this product if you get any deal or bargain I got it for 24$. Its ok with my spouse and others, but gives erratic reading while I use it.... Dont know may be it likes fairer sex."
5,Good cuff,"I find the readings on this cuff (when used properly) to be reliable. I have also double checked the results on myself with a standard electronic arm cuff and when checking family members with a standard manual arm cuff. It's small, light, easy-to-use and my patients find it much less cumbersome than an arm cuff. I would recommend it. Just be sure to read the instructions on how to use it and be very particular about arm position EVERY TIME you use the cuff."
1,"Great unit, but it broke...","Had this unit since August 2006. I bought it just to have something around to measure BP. The unit worked great - little effort or instructions needed - just put it on and press the button. It appears to give pretty accurate readings. The memory and extra features are a little more complicated to use, but I don't need or use them. For my money, turning it on and taking an accurate BP simply and quickly is the real advantage of these units. Well, the MF-81 seemed to do that well - but notice I used past tense. After sitting in my medicine cabinet for a couple years with minimal use, it went bad - the unit works OK, but the numbers are unreadable - a problem with the LCD screen. I am now sending it back under the 5 year warranty, but this costs me $7.95 plus postage - not a very good warranty policy - I suspect the $$ offsets their cost to produce the product. Hopefully, I'll get an operating unit back soon..."
1,"Worst Product ever purchased, with bad customer service",Purchased 2 monitor. One is working good.Other Worked good for 2 weeks. Then from display unit's place number started disappearing. Got this monitor replaced.The replaced one was worst than the first one. Display was again not working.Tried with customer care to replace this. They gave assurance that a return label will be sent. In last 2 month called several times. But nothing has been done.
1,Bad product,"MF-81 Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor looks so great that I ordered two, but to my surprise both of them are giving wrong results.I am surprised to see such nice reviews for this product...I will strongly recommend not to buy it.Thanks.."
3,Old faithful,"I bought this as a recommendation from The Art of Manliness, and I can say, it's not a bad start up brush...but I feel like there's probably better ones out there.It doesn't hold water or heat that well and the hair itself is kind of stiff. It almost feels like a paint brush. Oh and the hairs on mine when I bought it are all crazy, fly away and frizzy ones that fall out and don't seem tamed well.It's good for all around use, but it's overall very light and the brush hairs are too big. I have a normal sized face and this thing it just annoying since I normally just shave my neck and upper cheekbones and I can never coat those with lather without completely painting my face with shave soap/cream.Again good for starting but I feel you can do better."
5,A real workhorse,We used this to pull a sailboat under a bridge perpendicular to the towboat. Came through without a hitch! Highly recommend.
4,One of the worst fighting games ever.,"Aack... avoid! This is a sad jest. There is no music in the game, the controls are incredibly awkward and imbalanced. Realism, my bottom... If realism is what you get in return for disappearance of fun and atmosphere, then non-realistic fighting games like Soul Blade are much more worth it. There are no combos at all, no skills are required (I'm far from being a pro and I beat it quite easily), the character animation and design is absolutely awful... I can't fathom how so many people liked this sorry excuse for a fighting game."
5,nicorette,excellent product. Service was on time for delivery. Fresh product was not out of date. will order again from them
5,Nicorette gum is a life saver,"I attended St. Helena Hospital's smoking cessation program in May. They, along with the Mayo Clinic, support ""nicotine replacement therapy"" 100%. 14 people from around the U.S. attended this program and not one of us has returned to cigarettes as a result of NRT. Yes, I chew the gum all the time but I no longer am being poisoned by the hundreds of poisonous substances in cigarettes. Thank heavens for Nicorette."
2,Much better examples of Augustus Pablo elsewhere,"The tracks on this CD are not programmed correctly. What's listed as track 1 on your CD player actually plays about 20 seconds into track 2. Track 2 does the same into track 3 and so on. Therefore, you cannot listen to this CD on random play nor can you burn tracks onto another CD. And this CD clocks in at a mere 29 minutes and 20 seconds."
5,Convenient value camcorder,Ideal camcorder for first-timers...make sure to carry a seperate digital camera as the still capability is nothing to talk about.Easy to operate and convenient to make multiple copies on mini dvd. Included software is user friendly and can do all basic editing.
4,Great camcorder provides everything needed!,"Used it now for 2+ weeks - first use was low-light stage performance and I used the spotlight setting (one of many Program settings) which worked perfectly - video quality (and sound!) was amazing considering it's not HD. Dubbing all or select scenes is easy. Not too concerned over low quality stills since any serious situation I would want a high res dig camera for - one nice thing is ability to easily create photo stills from any video scene. Only gripe is that program titles (which are tedious to key in one letter at a time on the LCD) are not preserved onto finalized DVD-RW disc (so seem only marginally useful when mini-dvd is played back from Camcorder itself). All in all, a great full-featured cam at the right price."
5,the best yet!!!!!!!,"i own tomba and tomba 2. boy what a difference, t-2 is so much more organized in t-1 you go back and forth so many times it gets boring , but in t-2 it is way better. plus they talk and write the words on the screen so it is easier to understand for younger kids who cant read as well. if you have to choose this is the one but if you have t-1 and are considering buying t-2 don't hesitate, you won't regret it!!!!!!"
5,What more can you ask for,It was more than I expected and in much better condition as well. I will enjoy this one for a long time. It is one of those things you can lay on the coffee table and share the laughs.
4,Great Strategy Game,"The time limits means that you can not be distracted over-building your defenses. You must complete each level to get new tech to research new tech and manufacture more equipment or your forces will be obsolete. Game requires planning, and constant re-evaluation of your equipment mix and deployment of forces for every level of the game. Absorbing and great fun for those that are detail oriented and quick thinkers. Not a game for the physical fighting crowd. Requires patience."
1,too hard,"This game is too hard. Don't get me wrong, I like a good challenge but combine the learning curv and the controls... The controls take to much getting used to. The game play is not even very fun. If you like C&C you might like this, but if you ask me I will just replay C&C and save some money."
1,No oomph!,"I love ""Company"". I saw the original production eleven times on Broadway and each performance was as exciting as the one before it. So I was very excited when I saw this DVD. Of course I knew it would be different from the original, but just how different? Well this is a very tame version of the show-sort of a G rated version of an original R rating. All of the bite, sarcasm and yes the New York wit and feel of the show have been removed.The performances are good enough, but no one ever seems to really sink their teeth into the roles. I would recommend it to someone who has never seen the show but anyone who is hoping for anything near the caliber of the original should skip it. Oh why didn't we tape shows in the 70's?"
2,DEFINITELY NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"THIS TIME AROUND, PLAYERS DON'T HAVE TO UNLOCK GAIA TO PLAY AS HIM, AND THERE ARE TWO NEW FIGHTERS TO PLAY WITH. BUT, THIS GAME'S ENTERTAINMENT VALUE STARTS TO WEAR OFF, AND AFTER A WHILE, YOU'LL WANT TO GO BACK TO PLAYING THE 1ST TOSHIDEN. I GUESS THE GRAPHICS ARE OK BUT, THE FIGHTERS AREN'T AS FUN AS THEY USED TO BE AND PLUS, THE BOSSES ARE CORNY! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMEND ANY GAME PLAYER OUT THERE TO GET THE ORIGNIAL BEFORE THEY EVER GET THIS SEQUEL. ONE VERY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS GAME IS THAT IT DOES HAVE SOME FANTASTIC ROCK MUSIC!"
3,Good not great,"This book is okay for the novice Hasselblad user, of which I am one. Since it tries to be all things to all people, you have to wade through a lot to find what you are looking for. More than a bit pricy for what it is."
1,The worst set of pot and pans,The some of the handles have come loose after a couple of months. You have to keep tightening them with a screwdriver. They are dangerous to cook with.
1,"ug, nothing i expected","i was soooo disapointed in this piece!!! i looove the song imagine, and i have heard many others play this piece. this should not be a level intermediate. it should definately be beginner. it is super easy, and so much more could be given to this piece. this arrangement butchered it."
4,One of the best action/post-holocaust series made!,"This is one of the best stories in the entire series. Underwater cities - russians - lots of action, its got it all."
5,GREAT addition for the Smart Cycle! We LOVE this!,"My boys - who just turned 4 and 7 - can't get enough of this game! We had the Smart Cycle for a month before getting this additional software and I can't say enough GOOD about it. The games are varied and quite educational, and it adds so much to an already-pretty-good toy. The Smart Cycle's original software is still fun, and they like the games that came with the Cycle, but these are so much MORE fun that we could probably do without the others entirely.This is very math-oriented and great for my little vehicle lovers. There's a monster-truck type game where they jump over cars (very easy for little ones) and a road-builder game with earthquakes and giant robots that my older one (who is technically too old for the bike) absolutely adores. I don't know how Diego or Elmo (etc.) are, but this one is fantastic. FIVE stars, easily."
5,Hot diggity,This is my 3-year old's favorite game to play on his smart cycle.He loves to choose the color of his car. He learned very quickly how to naviagate the roads. Hours of fun.
3,Not cross dilled but still Brembo,"I purchased 2 of these, there not cross-drilled. The fact is your still getting Brembo rotors for $20 a piece new."
5,Fun for a 7 year old or a 21 year old,"First, I have to say that I love this game. My little brother (he is 7, I'm 21) discovered the game on a demo disk that came with our Playstation. As soon as we got it we both had to start a game. The game is simplistic enough that he could play on his own but challenging enough that I never lost interest in the game. The individual ""events"" that you have to clear can sometimes be a little difficult to figure out, but usually the supporting characters that you ""talk"" to in the game give you enough hints to work out the solution."
5,the best guide ever,"This guide to hiking in the Palm Springs area (Coachella Valley) was written in an enthusiastic, concise, and informative style which is friendly and makes the book very easy to use. All the pertinent information is there, as if you were talking to an experienced, knowledgeable, and happy expert (which you are). Can't go wrong with this!!!"
1,worst directions i have ever seen,"The pictures are nice, the directions for trail heads ,ok....But, thats all...Lenghts are incorrect...He needs to actually chart the distances, not guess... Don't waste your $ on this book...Better maps out there."
4,Glad he made it,"This book is written in a simple and eloquent style and succeeds at conveying the horror and courage of the Cuban raft experience. It's written in the style of ""The Old Man and the Sea"" and should appeal to readers of all ages. Quite a triumph for the author, if he himself made a journey like this (it seems that he must have, given the knowing detail)."
4,Pretty Good.,"This was a pretty good book, and I recommend it. The author really did her research and very accurately portrayed religious fanatisicm, including some of its characteristic jargon. I was impressed. Parts of the book were eerily tormenting. If you like to be spooked, this book might do it for you. My only complaint is that I would have preferred a stronger ending. By the last page, I was left with the feeling and opinion that things were not completely resolved. But it is still a book worth reading. Hope you like it too."
3,Not quite as good as it could be,"These is a fair to good product. The main problem I have with the playhouse it's not solid enough. In it's playhouse state it collapses too easily. In the cat bed state it's OK. you could probably get a cat bed for less money.The seller ""CoolCyberCats"" however is great to deal with."
1,"Really light-weight reading, for beginner's only, skip it","Not worth the price. This book contains very little details and is really for causul and light reading only. If you know anything about Windows NT, skip this book and buy another one. This book is strictly for NT/WIN2K beginners."
2,Not as Thin as I Hoped,"ProsLooks niceWell madeReasonable priceConsIt's too thickDesigned to hold too many cardsCard slots too tightI was looking for a SLIM wallet (1/2 inch or less) to hold 3 credit cards, ID and $100. The fold out insert adds too much bulk and still does not hold as much as an old Tommy Hilfiger I used for 7 years. I would not buy it again."
4,Decently Priced & Speedy Delivery,i bought this wallet since i had lost my previous wallet. The wallet is very nice and very slim so it doesnt create huge bulges in pockets. the material seems very high grade and the inside is quite nice. the delivery was very speedy and packaging was incredible. Price could be lower but not really complaining other than that good job!!
2,Terrible,"I do not recommend purchasing this wallet.First off mine came in what seemed to be a used condition, even though the box was in mint condition. The wallet was scuffed up and slightly dirty, and bent. This was a purchase from Amazon, not a third party.Second the wallet itself is TINY. It will not stay closed if you fill all the card slots with cards (one card per slot), let alone if you put money in there.Also putting cards in and taking cards out takes considerable force. I have a feeling they will stretch out over time, but as is right now, it feels like the slots will rip anytime I take a card out or put one back in.On that note, American dollars do not fit all the way in. The top sticks out quite a bit. Not sure what currency this was designed for, but not USD.Small wallet and terrible quality control. Avoid"
4,Nice slim wallet - I cut off the flap though,"After losing the slim Docker's wallet (Lot 31DK1304/UPC 017149117650), I had to upgrade to this one. It's small and slim. My only complaint was the flap that flips out at the top. I carefully cut it out and the wallet is now perfect. Nice replacement"
2,Geoffrey beene wallet,I received this as a gift. I agree that it is too small if you have more than 4 cards. I like a simple wallet and it seems to be well made but it does not hold enough cards so I have to find another one.
3,Not as slim as I would have hoped,"Compared to standard wallets, yes this wallet is thinner than most. This is achieved by thinner material and fewer pockets. However, when I transferred all of my stuff from my old wallet to this one, there was not much difference. If you like to carry a wallet in your front pocket and are hoping for a wallet that doesn't stick out so much, this might be a marginal improvement. I ordered aLeather Hybrid Super Skinny Bi-Fold Walletand this design makes a difference. Although this Geoffrey Bean Wallet is thinner than most, it still forces you to have all your credit cards stocked one one top of each other when the wallet is closed. This particular Big Skinny wallet has a larger foot print so that some of your credit cards are side by side. Although it makes for a larger size wallet, the thickness is much less than the Geoffrey Bean. So I am keeping the Geoffrey Bean for backup, but I use the Big Skinny leather hybrid super skinny bifold routinely."
3,Good Enough,"Looking for a slimline wallet is difficult. I was trying to replace a 4-year-old Coach. This one looked perfect, until it arrived. The photo holder is NOT detachable, so adds a little thickness to the overall profile. However, there are sufficient slots for only essential cards/ID's, which is exactly what I was looking for. The leather is nice, the finish is clean, and it still technically a small wallet - not a silly ""pimp purse"" that some wannabe-tough-guy will attach to a ridiculous-looking chain to then walk around looking to take a beating. If I find a way to cleanly cut the picture holder out, I'll update the review."
4,Great Slim Wallet,"This wallet is super slim, and significantly reduced the bulk in my butt pocket, which is a major plus. You can't fit that many cards in here - some cards that are made too long won't even fit at all."
2,Too Short and too easy!,"This game is a good game for kids who are learning how to play video games. If you are good at video games DON'T BUY IT. The characters are cute and funny. What you are trying to do is dodge bells and traps to get 3 keys. The keys get you the harp,hen that lays golden eggs and the cash. You must solve 3 puzzles to get a key. I think this game is for 5-9 year olds."
2,"Come back, Roger!","This album presents the talented Roger Filgate playing some wonderful guitar. Unfortunately, the songs are too pedestrian for my taste. It seems Roger is attempting to achieve some commercial success here, which I can't blame him for. If you want to hear Mr. Filgate at his best, pick up Wishbone Ash-Illuminations, which is fantastic from start to finish."
2,Prayerfully offering constructive criticism,"I truly and sincerely pray that Rev. Smith and readers will take these words in the loving spirit with which they are delivered. The idea has such great potential, and is a story that, sadly for the modern church, needs to be told. But having said that, I must say that as an avid and voracious reader of many genres, particularly African American fiction, I am finding this book very difficult to finish. Poor grammar in the narrative, typos and/or misspellings, and an overwhelming amount of punctuation errors both in the narrative and dialogue are so terribly distracting that they are taking away from the intended message. ... There is certainly an audience for Rev. Smith's work, and I pray that her next novel displays the potential I see."
2,Disappointed,"If you are looking for information about Jane Goodall's work with the chimps, this is not the dvd for you. This is nothing more of a plea for money. I'm certainly all for helping save wildlife, but what I was hoping for was to learn more about chimpanzees, their behavior and social structures."
3,"cute, comfy, but not the best quality","I bought a pair of these in black leather and loved them. They were really comfortable (kind of narrow at first but after awhile the leather stretched out a bit) and cute and I could wear them all day without my feet being in pain. Then the heel on one shoe fell off.Not the best quality, but decent for the price. I got a lot of wear out of them."
5,it's Great!!!,"i finished this book in two hours!! it was full of emotion, expectially between Jake and Gaia. I hope they'd get together. they'd be hell of a team!!basically: tatiana wants to kill gaiatatiana uses Jakeoliver ( yup the uncle) comes back into the pictureSam leavestention between Ed n Gaia, he's trying to move onJake gets shotJake and Gaia both have feeling for each other..."
1,Looks may be decieving....,"Okay, starting off I do NOT like this game! Camera angles are just plain horrible, graphics are BAD and now, I shall share with you the other things. Go through almost ENDLESS levels with trashy looking soldiers, and robots chasing you. You have to free demonic looking things (Gorgons) and have to listen to hypnotic chants for the music. For the loading screen, you have to stare at a monster skull for about 5 minutes. And I will warn you, Do NOT, I repeat , DO NOT, buy this game or even rent it! The cover of this game may look cool, :-( Definatly not like the movie. Why are the action figures in temples? Aren't they supposed to be in this kids home? I think this game is just plain DUMB. Trust me."
2,"Letters, sort of","Doty serves up his Doctoral Dissertation, according to him, dumbed down for the casual reader in 1973. The author first describes the Latin Letter and then narrows his sights to Paul's Letters. If you need this for a paper, ok, it's the simplest of a whole genre of Paul's Letter books, at only 70 + pages."
5,"High Quality, Good Value","High quality pillow cover that is sturdy construction, thicker than normal cotton that results in a bit firmer pillow feel than without this cover, which is actually a feeling that I like. Well-made, fits well."
2,"Decent wallet, Misleading Preview","The pictures Amazon provides as a preview for this wallet are inaccurate. I purchased this wallet as a Christmas gift based on those pictures -- primarily the picture of the slots in the wallet. When I received the wallet, I found that there were far fewer slots than in the picture and the slots were vertical, not horizontal as in the picture. It still is a decent wallet, but the pictures provided on the product page are misleading."
2,Disappointing,I have watched this program for the time it has been on and would have given the old ones a five. I do not enjoy family strife even if it does work out. The MD brother is quite professional and the brother a hard worker. They make an inspirational and enjoyable story. I don't want to watch it anymore. A split family is no fum.
4,way overpriced,"I buy mine from my local walmart for less than a dollar.I absolutely love this stuff. The inner wrapper is made of rice paper or something and its edible. The candy sticks rlly bad to ur teeth so dont chew it, but it tastes sooo good, like orange flavored or something.It also comes with a sticker, or at least thats what comes in the ones i get from walmart.I once told my boyfriend that THAT was the candy and that u peel it off and stick it on ur tongue and it disolves, bc it is tongue shaped. And he was actually about to do it. Lol"
2,way to expensive,"I want to start by stating that this candy does taste pretty good but thats all the good I have to say about it. One box comes with 6 pieces of candy that are half the size of a starburst. Starburst come with 12 to 20 pieces and they average .75 cents a bag where as these candies average $3 to $4 dollars a box (6 pieces). Terrible price for a few pieces of candy.Last but not least, Every time I see them in a store they average about $1.80 so if you do want them I don't suggest you order them off this site."
3,An admittedly tasty novelty,"These could really be an addiction. But I could never pay for the shipping and still enjoy the candy again. I ended up with 6 small peices of candy for over $6. My girls and I enjoyed them, and since we love so many things that have to do with Japanese culture, it was a novel experience. But next time, I'll find it in an asian grocery and spend a buck or two in purchase and gasoline cost, instead of the 5 bucks I spent on shipping."
5,Excellent Read! A must for new Christians,This book was very inspiring. It was easy to follow and very reader friendly. GREAT BOOK for new christians or someone who is interested in studying prayer.
3,Did not learn all to much,"Although very comprehensive in effort and detail, I felt it did not go below the surface of anger causes. It covered so many types of just everyday anger that even the Dali Lama would have to admit to some of them.I know everyone has their moments however to dwell on lists of ""does this happen when or does that happen when "" , I believe is less theraputic than to seek deep root cause. Thats where people learn to overcome the problem.I did not find this book helpful."
3,If you have a lot of time and want to organize your entire life,"This book is huge and for some it may be overwhelming. The book is thorough and covers everything that you could possibly organize in your personal life; however, I was disappointed by the lack of color and pictures. This book is for an individual who is serious about changing their entire lifestyle and has adequate time to do that."
1,wireless my butt...,"It has 2 wires conecting the car to the control pad. The wires are not long enough for the kids to really play with the car and have to crawl along with it in order to make it go. I guess you get what you pay for. I just thought I was getting a good deal, instead I have 3 headaches (one for each car I bought)."
3,They are a much better band than this CD portrays,"I am one of those music listeners who would rather NOT hear a live recording of most bands. This is one exception. Blackthorn is a GREAT live band and I love their shows, but was disappointed in this CD. The producer should have made this sound less ""pop"" and more ""Irish"". This CD sounds very 80's. On a positive note, the song selection is wonderful. You can see why they have such a devoted following. Buy the CD, but go see them live and you'll hear a difference, the band has much more depth and heart than on this CD."
4,Awesome!,"I went out and bought this title and I was quite surprised when I started playing it. First of all, the graphics are pretty impressive considering PlayStation being a 32 bit system. The character textures are very well done but the fighting backgrounds lack some detail. You can choose from 10 X-Men characters, 6 of them are the good guys, 4 of them are bad guys (and gals). I was a little bummed that there were only 10 playable characters but I didn't get bored using all of them. Second, the sound is excellent. The voiceovers were well done. It sounded like the voices from the X-Men animated series. The Academy option isn't that good, you just learn how to pull off different moves. The Cerebro option is cool because you can watch the movie trailer and view quite a few comic book pics and some pics from the movie. You can also unlock some character movies and some extra costumes. All in all, I think this game is worth buying and it is pretty entertaining."
5,Nice gentle book,"I can't say too much about this because although I am 91 years old and am in my 8th year of Parkinsons disease, I am supposed to be STUPID. I have already written web pages on my own. Recently wrote another just to see if I could. Back to this book. It is a good book and covers the subject nicely. But I might add that if you are REALLY STUPID, try something else - like sex for beginners. Don't give up until you are DEAD!!"
4,A good book...,"...this is a good book, but some of the scenes from ""Return of the Jedi"" are not captured in their full spirit, and the one of Leia strangling Jabba even becomes redundant after a while (and it's kind of hard to believe that THAT many people were in plain view of the event, but all either wanted Jabba dead anyway, or flat out didn't care)."
4,Well written novel.,I think this book was very enjoyable and well thought up by these 19 authors that helped make this book a real success and an enjoyable read.
3,Average material with occassional flashes of brilliance,"This book isn't particularly inspired as far as fiction goes. It's typical sci-fi fare with too many heroes and typical villains and those odd in-between characters. The stories are almost all about bad people who find out they're all good in the end(Ephant Mon's tale, for example, and the fates revealed by the epilogue). The book takes itself lightly, which makes it really enjoyable to read (The Weequays were hilarious). Dannik Jerriko's tale was just plain weird in my book. The highlights are ""A Bad Feeling"" and ""A Barve Like That"", two excellent stories that make the whole book worth it all. It ends with the fairy tale ""Skin Deep"" and an epilogue that gives nearly everyone a ""they are all reasonably happy"" ending that doesn't satisfy at all. If you're in the mood for sweet that might give you a toothache if you think too much, pick up this book."
5,"A great read...if you don't have it, GET IT!","This was an excellent book. I especially liked ""Of the Days Annoyances"". This was an interesting story and so was the book on a whole. I recomend this to lovers of Star Wars and even those who aren't. The Boba Fett story is a big help for those Fett fans like me who thought his death (or was it really a death?) in the movie was a little to sudden. I always hated the fact that he, the greatest and strongest BH ever should die so soon. Anywho, those are my two favorite storys. Along the others I liked were Oola's tale, and the Gammorean guards tale. But that doesn't matter, because your the one whos gonna read it. So if you don't have it, than pick it up already! You'll be glad you did."
3,Doesn't hold up to light use,We received one of these for my son's Christmas present in 2005. Immediately one of the doors came off. So I returned it and got a new one. A couple of days later the red door came off again. I should have returned it but never did. I find the unit frustrating. I would probably buy the simpler model without doors that open and close to save the frustation and money.
1,"doors fall off, don't open when button is pushed, massive","It looks great. Within two seconds (when I was just checking it out myself) the doors fell off and they don't open when the buttons are pushed half the time. I think for the price these things should work. Lost two of the red doors already, wondering where I can buy replacement doors?My son likes it anyway. Likes the whole set in general and plays with it everyday. Has a magenetic light and sound signal which was much less but is his favorite piece."
2,Don't judge a book by it's cover,While the content covered was quite usefull it was let down by the audio snippets that ended mid sentence and the fact that the video segments had very low volume audio on them.There is more usefull information on the market.
2,Not Real to Me,"It is interesting that so many people rated this book so highly. I could barely finish it but felt I had to. I am in charge of a book club and this was the book chosen for this month. As a mother of two I could not relate to these women giving birth at all. I also didn't like this author's way of writing. I can't exactly explain it but I didn't get a totally ""honest"" feeling about lots of it. I do commend this woman on being a midwife and writing about it. I just find it to be written in a voice that annoys me and seems almost an immature read to me. I guess mostly it is the conversations in the book throughout the different stories. It is like she is grasping for memories of what was said between people. Like she looked back in her paperwork and remembered the events, but had to make up the conversations."
4,Different view of birth experience,"I love reading about other women's birth experiences, and the view from the midwife was both informative and emotional. While I would never attempt a home birth due to known cardiac issues with my children, it made me wish that I could have had the experience. A balanced view of the home birth experience, without condemning those of us who have to opt for the hospital birth."
5,A great read,"I bought this book because I am doing research for a novel and I have no experience with childbirth. This is a big help. Other books I am reading are ""Spirtual Midwifery"" and ""A Midwife's Tale"". BTW did you know that this author writes reviews of other products on Amazon?"
5,Best foundation ever!,I am 42 years old. This is the best makeup I have ever used. It is a bit more expensive than most but worth every penny! I have always used a top quality makeup. I have tried others and never found one good enough to switch till now.
4,This game isn't very good.,"This game was supposed to be really good. I had seen it in stores many times and had thought about getting it, but wasn't sure. But when I went to my friends house he had it, and I played. DISSAPOINTING. This really isn't as good as it was supposed to be. Sure it is fun torturing your enemies, but it gets old. And it is pretty hard. You can get rockets, grenades, and stuff like that. And the controls aren't very responsive, especially jump, which doesn't help, considering this is a platformer. Overall this game wasn't very fun. You might like it, but I didn't."
5,EXCELLENT Service,Book arrived quickly and well packaged. The text is in excellent condition.The text is well written and comprehensive.
4,Cool!,"I PERSONALLY REALLY LIKED THIS ONE. IT IS VERY COMICAL. RAYE HAS SUDDENLY BECOME FAMOUS, AND THE SCOUTS ARE JEALOUS AND ANNOYED. A YOUNG GIRL REALLY THINKS RAYE IS COOL, AND WORKS FOR HER PRETENDING TO BE JUST LIKE HER, EVEN HAVEING THE SAME DREAM. SHE IS THEN ATTACKED BY THE AMAZON QUARTET! CAN RAYE SHOW NINAKO WHAT IT MEANS TO BELIEVE IN HERSELF? THEN SERENA AND RINI TAKE A TRIP TO PALLA PALLA'S DENITIST OFFICE WHERE THEY ARE ATTACKED! THEN RINI'S KINDERGARTEN PRINCIPLE IS ATTACKED AND LITA AND MINA ARE IN A BIG FIGHT! CAN THEY STOP THIER ARRGUING ENOUGH TO SAVE THE SCOUTS? A YOUNG BOY'S DREAM IS TO FLY USING A BIKE. RINI SHOWS PEGASUS, AND BEGINS TO QUESTION WHY HE NEVER TELLS HER ANYTHING AND HE LEAVES HER. THEY YOUNG BOY IS ATTACKED! CAN RINI SAVE HIM?"
3,not the correct book,I didn't get the right book in the first place. The only reason I decided to keep it was because I read 1 or 2 of the pages and the book sounded interesting. I hope you get the right book.
4,bloody mary,all the fake storys they say about mary are not true when people tell me that that story is not true their the wrong ones. in the book Mary Bloody Mary the story tells the true story. If you like to read on princess in the past or want to know more about Mary Bloody Mary this is the book to read
5,Great Book!,"I loved this book! I am historical fiction nut. This book really got me interested in the life of the Tudor's. I recommend this for anyone ages 12 and up. If you liked this one read ""Beware Princess Elizabeth"" also."
5,A novel to remember.,"Ah, history! My favorite subject, and an intriguing thing. Mary has been brought to life, both her worried, youthful side, and her detremined and stubborn side, the part of her that made her known as Mary, Bloody Mary, England's queen. This story, taking place in her youth, is well decribed with utmost accuracy. Depicting the eventful life of Mary Tudor, you will plummet into the sixteenth century, and into the heart of a princess. When I picked this book up, I wondered if it would be like a fairy tale, saying how wonderful and fruitful Mary's life was, and I was surprised when I read the story. Instead of boring literature, it shows the real life of Mary, her feelings about her father, his new wife, and Mary's own half sister, and how confused on the inside she is, but how brave she trys to act. Showing how a young girl is forced into womanhood, this is a novel to remember."
2,What's the big hype?,"The most wonderful thing about the book is the cover. It reads like a poor ripoff of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" - and that book was horrible! Characters don't develop. They're simply revealed by their prophetic words and actions. Give this book a miss."
1,Broken upon arrival and fan broke yesterday,I bought this item no more than two months ago. And the motor in the fan already broke. When it arrived the plastic casing was cracked.Well done Amazon.
1,Not for little kids!!! dangerous experiments!!!,"I bought this for my 12 1/2 yo son a few months ago. While recently waiting in the car for a train, I looked through it again and was really shocked. There are items that are dangerous to be in a book geared toward kids and some things that are just offensive. One experiment or MacGyver how-to gives instructions on mixing ammonia and another chemical- but oh, by the way it is dangerous. Another details how to unzip womans dress to make it fall off. Yet another involves pictures or videos (sorry, its not in front of me) and says if you get any good naked pics of females to post it to the internet.This is BEYOND irresponsible and way beyond inappropriate for young readers."
3,And now .. the TRUTH,"... geez, you wonder what people are up to when they write their reviews. This is the skinny of the book: it is NOT a how-to manual, but rather a ""This happened in one episode ... could it work it real life?"" book. Mostly, no. Some, yes ... sort of. That is IT. Anyone who bought the book expecting to become the ""real"" MacGyver after reading this book is a fool. This is nothing more than a homage to the series ... really, more of a ""mythbusters"" type book. Read it with this perspective, and it was a funny and interesting read."
4,Fun book,"This book is very funny and informative. Although, some things are said very sarcastically towards dear MacGyver (and his mullet). Most things you would never need to know or you would not have the things to do them with (i.e. meatlocker, straight jacket, etc.), but it's fun to read about them anyway. Great gift for MacGyver lovers or guys that like to do experiments."
1,Low density!!,"Any body tell me is it really for the Mosquito protection? I bought it and I was surprised how low the density is. I guess fly can squeeze in it. The hole is huge!! so, I bought other brand. It has high density but fragile.Can it protect from sandfly? Certainly not!! This blood sucking fly is smaller than Mosquito.If it can protect from sandfly and mosquito I will change my star rate. I'm afraid to use it. Tell me anyone can i use it for sandfly and mosquito?"
3,Double Wide - not double thickness,"The net worked; kept the bugs out for my son at camp, but I didn't read the details carefully. It's double WIDE."
5,"Coghlan's Double Mosquito Net, White","Not flimsy. Easy to install on a four-poster bed. Use four rubber bands. If you are going to be in mosguito country, having this netting on your bed can prevent a lost-night's sleep caused by even one bothersome bug. It's also great insurance now that West Nile virus seems here to stay. Quick delivery. Easy to repack."
4,works just fine,"If you're kind to these nets, they work wonders. The one I have up currently covers a king size mattress, fitting snugly at the corners. Keeps the bugs out just fine. Not the most robustly constructed things, but for 10 bucks (or whatever they cost), they perform just how they're supposed to. I can see them failing at the corners eventually, but not until they've put in some good work first."
4,Easy and cute,Its easy to put on and very cute. Everyone is always asking where I picked this up. It was a little pricey though...
4,Ajax MVC intro,"Kris did a really good job to be developer friendly. Even thought there are some ""TODO"" list in the sample code, the coding style is very clean, dood inbtro to Ajax MVC implementation. It could be better if Kris can go little deep, for example, Javascript OO, mini-MVC inside view object, feel the ""display"" will be too heavy if object has lots of events attached. Overall, it's a fine reading."
5,What's wrong with this one?,"I can't believe this. Everyone says this game is ""average"" but as far I'm concerned, this game kicks some bootie. It is so much better then them cheap rip offs like mortal kombat and Tekken. Cause there is lots of blood and you can even perform fatalities in the middle of the match! What I'm trying to say is, this game is awesome if you like blood and stuff and in my opinion is a lot better then Mortal kombat or anything like that."
4,"Witty, sarcastic fun","Adda Sinclair, New York times best selling romance writer isn't doing so well in the romance department in her own life. She gave up on men when Birgitta Roth, a fellow romance writer, stole Adda's husband. The relationship didn't last, but Birgitta still has Beijing, Adda's dog. She could get by without the husband, but she misses her dog.Nick Farnsworth, president of Intrepid Books wants to publish Adda's next book. The problem is Adda has a colossal case of writer's block. Besides, every time she gets close to Nick, sparks start flying. Unfortunately he is as shy of committment as she is. Just when things finally start going well, Birgitta makes an accusation that almost costs Adda everything.Stealing Adda is witty, sarcastic, and fun. It's also a story about how one woman with no religious inclination at all discovers God."
4,New Concept in Information,"""Roadside History of Montana"" is a very good book on the history of Montana but beyond that it is a valuable outdoor recreation tool. Along with ""Roadside Geology of Montana"" this book adds wheels to reading. The concept of formatting a book to follow highways has opened up new vistas for me when traveling with a companion to read as you travel, or to study in advance when traveling solo. This concept has increased my enjoyment of ALL of my outdoor activities, at least the getting there part."
4,Excellent service and delievery,service and delivery was great for the price it was ok... I wish the green carpet could have been a little more sturdy but over all glad I got it
1,Save your money,"This book is terrible. The examples are incomplete and filled with typos. You will NOT learn Turbogears from this book, just how to be frustrated."
1,Ultra Slim Travel Charger,"Hi. Please avoid this product at all cost. These are also selling on eBay from $.01-$20.00. Unfortunately, I purchased one of these on eBay, and once I plugged it in I found out it doesn't work at all.The reason I am posting my comments on the Amazon Board, and everywhere else for that matter, is that while surfing for an OEM replacement I have found these poor Chinese made imitations showing up all over the place.Net-net: Spend the 30-40 bucks and get the real-deal as the imitators suck.Tt"
4,super nintendos street fighter2s are harder and cheaper,I always like the street fighter games best on super because thay are harder. than collection2 are fun but not hard and you are crazy if you are going to spend a lot money on this one.people sell it for to much money. I have both collection if you like street fighter and have super look for those on super.but the difrents is on the collection you get three difrent tipes of street figther.I say this is the best collection it is more like the arcade. thank you for reading.
3,Bionicle Encyclopedia,The book is informative enough but the pictures are really small. It's hard to appreciate the detail of the different characters.
4,Great quality CD,"My husband mentioned that he would like a version of ""We'll Meet Again"" by the singer that performed it at the end of the movie Dr. Strangelove. I found this CD and he loves it! The quality of the recording is very nice -- and Vera Lynn has a wonderful voice."
2,Very rough but shows promise,2.5 stars-In other words a very average read. The plotline was interesting with the possibilities of genetic engineering falling into the wrong hands. The sinister corporations were a little bit unbelievable but the way they manipulated the protagonist Dr. Kincaid added a touch of plausability to the novel. If Nelson Erlick can work on his plotting (have his bad guys act a litle more human to increase conflict) and his character development a little more he does show promise as a writer. His explanations of the science involved are done well and he communicates his passion for this subject in his descriptions.The overall lack of realism of his characers actions however pull this novel down to a mediocre level -and I think he can do much better than this.
2,The DUNE universe meets Melrose Place.,"While I found HOUSE ATREIDES to be entertaining, this book read like a confusing sci-fi soap opera. There was no story flow worth mentioning; every couple of chapters, the story advances a couple of years, with virtually nothing happening in those lost years. And there are plotlines that go nowhere; it was obviously written with a sequel in mind.While it was nice to get introductions and backstories to some of DUNE's memorable characters (like Gurney Halleck and Feyd), they still left me somewhat disappointed, as thought there was much more that could have been said.While DUNE is a book I could read again and again, I can't say the same thing for HOUSE HARKONNEN."
3,same tone as first prequel,"If you likes the first prequel, you'll like this volume. Likewise, if you hated it, then you'll hate this one. Some of the dangling subplots in the first prequel are fleshed out in this volume. A lesser complaint is that there are too many unconnected subplots in these volumes. They relate more to the original's series than to each other. The prequels flesh out the background of Frank's series, but lack their subtly and texture. Each re-reading of Frank Sr.s original book reviews details I had missed before. I don't feel I'll gain additional insight re-reading Brian's prequels."
2,Full of padding and REALLY sloppy plot/character development,"Sorry to say, this is an obvious pay-per-page publisher's advance. Some good stuff but not nearly enough for the page count. Characters repeat their internal musings chapter after chapter. Multiple chapters are pointless idylls -- e.g., 20 pages on a fishing trip that does nothing to advance the plot. I finally gave up at 75%, when these lazy authors set up the following RIDICULOUS plot point.Duke Vernius has been renegade and successfully hiding on Arrakis and Salusa Secundus for 10 years. When he decides to repeat the nuclear disaster by attacking the Corrino home world, HE TELLS THE SMUGGLER WHY HE WANTS A BIG ASS CARGO SHIP.The writers got their money. I didn't get my money's worth."
5,At last!,"House Harkonnen hasn't satified my appetite for Dune--it's made it worse! This prequel explains Duke Leto's seemingly exagerrated reactions to the attempts on Paul's life and Jessica's reputation in Dune...With that kind of background, his reactions now seem somewhat subdued! Towards the end of the book, the dueling Houses do get confusing, but I'm waiting for the third prequel before I make a judgement about it. I really enjoyed reading this book, just as much as I enjoyed House Atreides, and just as much as I will enjoy House Corrino. I think BA and KJA are doing an excellent job bringing it all together, especially in the face of, at times, very rabid, very venomous, ""dedicated"" Dune fans. Thank you for allowing us into the Dune Universe again!!"
2,"Nice effort, horrid writing","I'm a big fan of the Dune series, like most folks seem to be who've written reviews here. I was prepared to like this trilogy by Herbert's son, and really gave it the old college try.I didn't expect the writing to be up to Herbert's standard, but even with that said, the whole book is in serious need of a firm editor's hand.What killed it for me was finding the word ""muscular"" used three times on a single page to describe the same person. I suddenly realized that I couldn't waste any more time on something written this badly."
4,damn harkies,"more graphic violence (rapes, etc) than the rest of the dune series.Execellent insights to the baron and beast"
3,"If your new to Dune, don't start with the prequels","Simply said, the characters in the original Dune would beat the hell out the prequel characters. This new Dune series is being carried by the strength of the original.If you're a Dune fan, it's better than nothing; but, as been pointed in other reviews, House Harkonnen can't compare to the complexity of the original Dune series.Still, I can't wait for the next book to come out."
3,all DVD,"scuse me i don't speak American not justfor this DVD view and sound are not just, I think that it results from the masterisation. it is the only DVD which I bought at home which has the least good quality. Others are completed. And when I see hamp' in this etat has the end of his life, me who saw him in France or he was if swinging , i'm very sorry"
5,Fantastic Storyline,"T.L. Higley is one of my all time favorite authors.This book, Marduk's Tablet, held my interest from start to finish.If you love historical mysteries, you'll love this book!"
1,Amazon Customer Service is non-existant,"Unable to download this piece, and Amazon Customer Service has been spectacularly unhelpful. They've been telling me for 2 weeks that they'd have someone fix whatever their problem is. I've never experienced such appallingly awful, shoddy treatment from Amazon before, and I've been placing 5-6 orders a year since 2003."
1,Manslaughter/Murder tries to be sexy,Cute boy in need of love and guidance may not care if he has unsafe sex....but the HIV positive older man is only too willing to take advantage and spread disease- knowingly- instead of truly caring for the vulnerable young man.Terrible dissapointment.
1,Solutions ... yes; helpful ... HARDLY!!!,"Bought this back in September with the hope that I would receive legitimate help with the terrible textbook these authors wrote. NO SUCH LUCK! Do yourself a favor, buy the Schaum's guide to differential equations and don't look back.This book gives solutions to the odd-numbered problems of the same-titled text, but really doesn't bother to do a thorough enough job to help a student new to the subject of DE. Fortunately, I have a professor that makes sense or I would be screwed! And, I'm also out 40 bucks (I just can't stand monetary mistakes like this).If you are a Math enthusiast/hobbyist, stay away from this set entirely. I'm certain there are plenty of GOOD books on the market for a topic as interesting as this one. If you already bought these books .... sorry, and best of luck!"
1,THIS WAS A GIFT!,"I am very happy to review products that I order and actually get to use or try personally. However, there needs to be a method to identify that the purchase is for a gift and incidentally was shipped directly to the two year old who now is using the item. This would hopefully alleviate your sending these inane emails asking for my review of something I never even saw."
3,Heavy but good,This is a very heavy iron skillet. It does do its job very well but food does tend to stick to the bottom of it.
4,Good pan so far,"This cast iron pan is very heavy and large. I have used it for frying potatotes, chicken, etc. and it has done quite well. For the price from Amazon ($15), and combined with free shipping, you cannot go wrong here."
2,Flip-Up Sunglasses keep flipping off,Neat looking sunglasses. Good lenses. Big problem: lenses keep separating from the framework when they are flipped up and down.
2,A little expensive for what you get,"UPDATE 10/14/2011:Another high beam/daytime running light bulb just burnt out - I won't be buying these any more.Bought these to replace my stock bulbs in my BMW X3, for both low and high beams. While they are a little brighter than OEM, they certainly aren't blue, in fact, they aren't really white either. They still have a lot of yellow in them, so if you are looking for a true HID xenon blue/white look, you are going to be disappointed.As the high beams double as the daytime running lights in my vehicle, that has already caused one of these to burn out in less than 1 year. Unfortunately, the Hella return policy is that you need to return BOTH bulbs in the package for warranty replacement.Getting to my bulbs is a PITA, so I didn't feel like removing the still working bulb to send it back, so I just ordered another set.For the price, how short their life is, and combined with Hellas return policy, I may shop elsewhere for replacement bulbs."
1,Broke after a month!,"I replaced the original belt after more than six years of regular use. This belt broke, or rather disintegrated, after just one month! I don't think I installed it improperly because it is not difficult and the vacuum cleaner worked fine for the first month. All of a sudden, the belt shredded into bits."
2,didn't last long,"ordered this belt in november was broke by january checked everything moves freely can find no reason for it to break, the original lasted 1 1/2 years. thats what happens when you buy because of price. its my fault i knew better."
2,Eureka the Boss Smart Vac and belt,"I'm just unbelievably unhappy with this machine, the frequency with which the belt breaks, and the awkwardness of using it. A well-known consumer magazine rates this model highly and that is why I bought it. However after fighting the machine to get it into nooks and crannies and to do an adequate job on bare floors, I can only conclude that the testers vacuumed both carpets and floors in rooms that had less than the average amount of furniture in them. Just try vacuuming under your dining room table, carpet or floor, with this oaf of a machine and see if you don't want to pull your hair out. It would be a blessing to see the manufacturers return to the inclusion of a special floor accessory brush that they gave us for so many years. The vac just doesn't get the job done."
4,"Works, but feels a little thin","I didn't save the prior belt, so it might be the same size as the previous belt, but it feels pretty thin and the vacuum seems to not have as much power as it did before, but maybe we strained the motor when breaking the prior belt (hair and stuff got caught in it).The belt hasn't broken, and has gone through a couple times when things got caught, so it will probably be fine."
4,Vacuum cleaner belt.,My origional belt lost tension and the brush would not work. I had difficulty in locating a replacement beltin my locality and after looking on Amazon I found it and ordered it. I cannot rate the belt at the present asit is a backup. I'm sure it will be superior to the origional belt supplied with my vacuum cleaner.
1,poor quality - high price,"Generic belt came without Eureka packaging as shown in ad. It's just some aftermarket belt with a high price tag applied. I found a 2 pack of the same belt for 1/2 the price. Watch out for these Amazon 'deals'. Seems they've got into the 'screw your customers if you can' mentality, regardless of how small the screwing is. One more thing. The item took 13 days to arrive."
2,Great Vacuum but bad belt system.,Man this belt is just too thin.I am thinking of gluing two together and trying that.Eureka has a great product which is cheap but failed on this belt.Horrible belt.
1,Dissappointing,"Went with this net as it was nearly identical to another that I purchased in prior years. The first one lasted about a season and a half, so I was somewhat hesitant to purchase another; but due to price, I tried this net. It took 2 hitting sessions (my son uses it for baseball hitting practice) and this net tore. It states it's a multi sport and even has a picture of baseball on the box, but it will not hold up to this type of use. I sent it back and had to spend the additional money and purchase the Jeggs net. We've had it for several weeks now and it's completely obvious that the Jeggs net is superior in quality and workmanship and will stand up over the test of time."
3,"Awesome when setup, hassle to setup","The product is great when setup, but speaking as an engineer by professionit takes forever to setup, two ppl make it faster but still takes a while."
5,Great Longboard!,This is a great looking board with a vintage longboard look. The ride is very smooth with easy turns. Lots of fun! I would definitely recommend the board.
3,Bradley Sugar is a true entrepreneur. I paid $11.53 to read his advertising.,"This book is an advertisement for his company. Action International Team is a global network of business coaches, and this book tells you how his team will really help your business grow.He has good ideas, but I felt cheated at the end."
1,Keep working til you get it right.,"I am a trememdous fan of the Rocket Men serials, all 3 of them. King of the Rocket Men, Radar Men from the Moon and Zombies of the Stratosphere. Having them on vhs I was not looking forward to the daunting proposition of having to transfer them to dvd with a home dvd recorder. But that's just what the production people of this dvd did. When I got my copy it looks like a very amateurish job done on someone's home computer. When I tried to play the dvd I couldn't because these amateurs forgot to ""finish"" the dvd so my dvd player couldn't recognize it. When I tried to contact the company several times to arrange for an exchange I got no response at all. I gave it one star only because this system will not let me give it no stars."
1,"be afraid, be very afraid!","what a piece of junk! every dvd played pauses for any length of time, 5 seconds to 1 minute! i've bought 3 machined from 3 different stores, and guess what? they all freeze! heres the best part, sony refuses to aknowledge ANY problem! when i call them, they all play stupid!I was even told by a customer service rep that the problem may be with my halogen lights 30 feet away in the kitchen. Like the other two before it, this ones going back. TRUST ME, go with the panasonic model, the remote is a little combersome, but it sure beats movies pausing EVERY TIME!.............shame on you, sony for failing (refusing) to do any thing about this HUGE problem!OPEN YOUR EYES,THIS MACHINE IS AWFULL!"
1,"Poor quality, lousy customer support","Don't waste your money. I bought this product 6 months ago. Yesterday it stopped working. Completely dead. Customer support will trade me for a refurbished unit for $85. Any complaints about this are ignored and a stock answer (""your unit appears to need repair"") email is sent. Sony used to mean quality, but not for at least this product, based on many other customers experiences."
1,Warning do not buy this product!,"I purchased this combo. After 10 days the DVD player did not work. I had to send it from NY to Laredo TX for an exchange at my expense. The second one did not work properly either. The VCR part did not bring in the UHF stations. I again had to send it back to Laredo. They did pay for the FedEx to Laredo, TX this time. Now they cannot seem to find this second one that I had sent back.Their service is abominable. They do not seem to know what they are doing. It has been over six weeks since I sent back the first defective product."
2,I agree with the others,"I should've read all of the reviews as well before making a purchase. The product was GRRRRRREAT when I first purchased it a year ago...Now, I will not play ANY CD OR DVD. I've even used discs right out of the package. I've grown up on Sony products and I am disappointed that they produced such a poor quality product at such a high price. I do not recommend that anyone purchase this unit."
2,Unreliable at best,"I bought this unit a few years back and now am in the market for a DVD Read/write combo unit, so I decided to see how well I did before when purchasing this unit. After reading most of the reviews, it is apparent to me that you can either get 1 of 3 units when you purchase. A piece of junk, and unreliable problematic one, or one that just hasn't shown any issues yet. I can say that all of the negative reviews are correct. I have seen pixelation, freezes, not all DVD's can be read (store-bought ones) and now recently grey and white static screens occuring from time to time during viewing. I have been one of the lucky ones, but now it seems that poor quality has finally caught up to me. Do yourself a favor and pass this one, because it will fail on you someday, and once it does, it seems to get worse fast. 2 reccomended units would be Panasonic and OPPO."
1,"POS - JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!!","I've had all of the similar problems mentioned in other reviews. Problems with some discs triggering a parental advisory even though parental control is turned off, not playing some discs at all (Sony discs), and randomly freezing in the middle of a dvd. DO NOT BUY!!! PIECE OF JUNK!!!"
1,No Go,"Yahtzee gives me an error when I load - ""incompatable"" - even though I was told (via email ahead of time to Yahtzee supplier)that it would run ok. I have Vista 64-bit."
1,game will not install,"game is totally useless. it will not install what so ever. I have NOT got to play it what so ever, I am totally disappointed."
3,Where have all the Family Circus Books Gone?,"After a gap of at least 5 years, this book has been added to the Family Circus cycle of literature.Once upon a time new Family Circus books would appear about every 6 months by the checkout at the grocery store. Suddenly, the supply was cut off.Family Circus just is. You don't have to keep track of plotlines from years ago. Because they are the same. And I find them to be soothing in a macaroni and cheese kind of way.I try not to dwell on the fact that PJ was introduced to the FC the year before I was born.More Family Circus. More! I request it."
5,A Truly Great and Interesting Film,"I saw the film in a theater in New York and am ordering it to own. The film was informative, insipirational and truly enjoyable to watch. It tackles a complex issue and provides a great historical framework. The soundtrack is awesome. Definitely not just for surfers-- I highly recommend it for all."
5,Real Zionism,"Amnon Rubinstein, former Minister of Communications of the Israeli government and dean of Tel Aviv University Law School, offers a brilliant insight into Zionism, its workings, and realities. Rubinstein probes through works of early Zionists like Nordau and Jabotinsky and opposes them to more recent developments such as Gush Emunim. Although the book was written back in 1984, it's insight is very pertinent to the current political situation in Israel."
3,Five stories from weak to strong,"Here we have 5 potentially interesting bounty hunters (6 really, but 4-Lom and Zuckuss are together). The first story (about IG-88 by Anderson) is terrible. The writing is too flat, too bland considering that the main character is planning something with galactic implications. The only good thing about it is that Boba Fett makes an appearance (he is featured in the last story)which improves our admirition of him. The stories improve as they go, with Zuckuss having a fine tale about alliances and his motivations. Boba Fett's tale is the best of the lot, giving some insight to this fellow, showing that he is a person with feeling and contraditory beliefs (which makes him more believable, more likeable). My advice would be to just skip the first story"
5,"A ""Seth"" novel?","Jane Roberts and Seth may be gone, but it appears that an author has come along to carry the torch for them: Jan Longwell-Smiley! Although the author goes off on her own interesting tangents, this is essentially the Seth material in the form of a fun, intriguing story. It would certainly make Jane and Seth proud! Ms. Smiley gets straight to the point, as she dispells many of the New Age notions that are constantly being puked out by all the so-called metaphysical ""experts."" Her take-no-prisoners approach and attititude are a welcome relief from such books as THE CELESTINE PROPHECY, which only insult our intelligence. If you're tired of all the crap that's being passed off as metaphysical ""wisdom,"" MASTER OF DISASTER is a book that deserves your serious attention."
1,Don't waste your money,"This machine was a complete waste of time and money. After following the directions exactly I ended up with runny ice cream, not even thick enough to be a milkshake. I tried a second time and let it run for twice the recommended time and the ice cream still didn't freeze. On top of that, it is poorly made and horrible to clean. Don't bother!!"
1,Soft Serve Soup,"I was so excited about the ice cream maker that my grandmother bought me for Christmas. The box says, ""Ice cream in less than 30 minutes."" My first disappointment came when I read that I had to wait 24 hours to freeze the canister before using it. My second disappointment came when I had to chill the mixture for a period of 2 to 4 hours before churning it. My final disappointment came when it took over 30 minutes to churn the chilled mixture and it still was nothing more than a soft serve soup. I froze the remainder overnight. It wasn't bad. Not my idea of making fresh ice cream in 30 minutes or less. After cleaning it thoroughly, I will be taking this back to the store. One star is too generous for this writer. That Cuisinart Dual-Flavor ice cream maker looks pretty good right now."
1,HORRIBLE MESS !!!!!!,This product LIES LIES LIES horrible disgusting soupy mess doesnt even mix at all ! Cost of products to make ice cream almost the cost of the machine ! Total waste of my time and my money I wish we could all sue rival for our time wasted and cost of machine and aggrivation ! The mixture doesnt freeze and It sticks to the walls of the bowl and machine stops working ! what a mess !!!!!!!!!!!!! also my machine smelled like it was burning after 5 minutes .
1,goopy diseaster,"I received this ice cream maker as a present and was really disappointed to find that after several tries I could not make anything more than a sticky, goopy mess. Then, I found out how much this thing cost, and I really hit the roof! My advice it to just get the old fashioned ice cream maker - much less effort if you can believe that!"
4,People Obvioulsy Can't Read...,"You can instantly tell which people actually read the title of the product...SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM Maker! This means, your ice cream isn't going to be scoopable. My maker came with two packets of ice cream mix that you only have to add milk to and your are DONE! We've successfully made sherbert from scratch too. Google and you can find many recipes for homemade soft serve ice cream.You can purchase packets in the grocery store for under two bucks. Every store has the Rival brand ice cream mix these days. Or you can make your own ice cream, but please keep in mind that the ice cream has to be softer in order for it to come out of the machine when tilted."
4,Monarch of the Glen - Series Four,I watched this on TV in the UK and the series is not actually completed on the DVD series. Most unfortunate. We are left high and dry because of the lack of the last (possibly) two or three episodes. Such a shame for a great and repeatable series.
4,Go ahead...Laugh,"For those who have fallen in love with the BBC series Monarch of the Glen, follow the ups and downs, squabbles and antics, and miscommunication of this family. Season 4 continues the saga of Archie McDonald trying to save the family estate while trying to also make everyone happy and save his sanity. Like seasons 1-3, season 4 has you sitting there laughing and also appreciating your own family."
5,Honest NJUN,"I liked this dvd cause it is about a boy becoming a man. Then he finds that he has two sisters, but in reality he has only one and the other has a crush on him. It also states that someone shouldn't judge people by what they look like, but for what is inside of them that counts."
3,Not as educational as I had hoped,I purchased this for my second grade daughter who does not like math. We own the Money Bags game and it had gotten too easy for her. The description of this game made it sound like it had levels of play that would be along her level of math. I was disappointed that it only has 50 cent pieces and dollars. I was hoping for regular currency to be able to count and use (like the Money Bags game). When playing with four the game goes on and on and is quite boring. It is not mathematically challenging either since everything costs either .50 or $1.
3,"Solid Writing, Decent Stories...","I've been an avid fan of Lawrence Block's works, and only recently read the Chip Harrison series. This collection includes ""Five Little Rich Girls"", and ""The Topless Tulip Caper"", the third and fourth installments in the series. I enjoyed the first story the best, the writing style is unmistakably Lawrence Block. Chip Harrison, an 'detective's assistant' is like Bernie Rhodenbarr (from Block's Burglar series) meets Keller (from Hit Man and Hit List). Leo Haig is your classic genius detective, despite his occasional dottiness. The stories are well written, but a bit risqué. ""Five Little Rich Girls"" was originally published as ""Makeout with Murder"" for a good reason. There's more of the same in the ""Topless Tulip Caper"". They're quick reads, so if you're looking for some fun, pick it up - the title's getting a bit scarce."
4,Indiana actually has some geology,"This is definitely one of the better books in this series (I own most of them). If you, like me, have always regarded Indiana as a place you have to drive through, you'll be as surprised as I to discover just how much interesting geology there is. It's a good read besides."
5,Doggie Hammock lover,I have had 2 of these before and have worn them out each time. I LOVE these. Good sturdy quality and keeps my dogs from ruining my seats and falling into the floor board.
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This hammock style car seat cover is well made and durable, but I don't care for the little bungee cords that hold it in place on the back seat. As soon as one of my dogs jump in, the cord stretches down a lot and half of the seat back is exposed. This also allows the cover to drape way down close to the floor. I attached the back of the cover to some carrier rings in the back area of my suv and this seems to hold the back cover up better. Also, putting a lot of large solid items on the floor under the hammock make for a larger area that the dogs can sit/lie comfortably on. I have four large rubbermaid type containers with dog food and other supplies under the hammock."
4,"If you are a mom, have tissues handy","If you are a mother, or even if you're not, you will be moved to tears by both of these women; each of whom has to live through a mother's worst nightmare...one the death of her baby, and one having her baby stolen. I couldn't put the book down until I knew what happened to baby Dylan and Annie...and although she did a despicable thing, I couldn't help but but feel some sympathy for Lynelle. The ending is a testament to the forgiving side of human nature even after being wronged in the worst possible way. As for the breastfeeding references, as a mom who breastfed for 13 months, I feel that they add so much to the story in that they really accentuate the bonding and the depth of love that Lynelle felt for the two babies...also, the pain that Annie feels when not being able to nurse mirrors the pain that she feels during the absence of her son."
1,Thumbs down,"While the story was riveting and the ending was satisfying, I could not help but be revolted by the constant mention of breastfeeding. Especially when Lynelle breastfed a baby not her own. This was disgusting! For me that ruined the book, which I might otherwise have enjoyed. By the way, I'm a mother who bottle-fed by choice."
2,A wishful book,"The whole time I was reading this book I kept wondering if this was intended for adults or children? The subject matter certainly did not seem appropriate for children but I found the book ""childish"". The characters are portrayed as either evil or good without exception and Mara is not a believeable heroine.A disappointing book."
4,Pleased with the auto-putt,I just picked up the auto-putt yesterday and so far it has worked as expected. The ball returns well and for the price paid I am well pleased with my purchase.
5,Makes learning the Bible so easy . . . and fun!,"This book series is so easy to read and the excellent design uses reference icons to help the reader navigate the thorough material.I can hardly wait for the next book in the series! Great writing, terrific design, learning the Bible is fun again!"
4,3 and 1/2 stars really...,mr. duck writes some of the finest outlines in bible prophecy. this outing on daniel's #1 and i've read many daniel outlines
2,"Funny Guy, not well produced video","The video doesnt do justice to the comedian, it was poorly produced and edited and looks more like a home video. It's a real shame because the comedian is hysterical and very talented."
4,Good leg workout,"Overall, I am pretty satisfied with the Winsor series.I enjoy doing this 20 minute video that is just for bun and thighs. Although she doesn't do enough reps for certain excercises, the ""fetal thigh"" section is really good. I do feel the burn at the end, but am not overly tired. I would definitely recommend."
5,Good stuff,"Okay - Pilates, for me, is the exercise routine I do when I am out of shape. Pilates is low impact & muscle engaging, however; now that I have joined a gym & do 30min of cardio per day + 30 minutes of weights - I have found that this video, along w/other pilates videos I once did, does nothing for me. Yes, this video once burned my buns & thighs, so if you are out of shape - this is a good one for you."
5,Great!,I love Winsor Pilates. I do this almost daily. It's a work out with benefits: tones & relaxes. It was recommended to me by my personal trainer at [...]. Give it a try!
2,"Not worth it, doesn't live up to the hype!","I have yet to figure out if this thing is actually on and working. The light is red when turned on but there is no sound, motion in the water or any indication that something is happening. I tried to remove fresh stains off clothing without success. I tried to clean a diamond ring and the inside of the diamond still looked dirty after more than the recommended time and combination soap/water stated. I bought this to avoid getting a big jewelry cleaner and for the fact that it is supposed to remove stains but it doesn't live up to the hype. Invest in something a bit more cumbersome that actually does what it's supposed to do."
2,"Quality tissue, no quality control","The tissue itself is fine, and the price and convenience of having it in bulk is great. Unfortunately, the quality control is not the best. The design of the tissues and box is supposed to bring the next tissue out after you take the top one. Starting a third of the way through each box, the tissues no longer pull the next one up so you are left digging in the box trying to find the edge of the next tissue! Then of course you end up grabbing 3-4, and either wasting them or shoving them back in the box. I'm two-thirds of the way through a case and EVERY box had this problem.Perhaps it's just the one case, but maybe not. I'll update if we end up trying another case."
2,Good for the conscience not for the nose,"These are much rougher than any other tissue I've used. Pulling the first tissue inevitably results in pulling out a third of the tissues, then stuffing them back in, then they don't often automatically pull each other out as you use them.The difference in enironmental impact vs. cost is negligible, so until they iron out these issues I recommend the standard options."
3,Still looking for a soft one,"OK, buying 100% recycled tissues was the right thing to do. But if you have a serious cold, this is not the soft tissue you want. My 10-year-old immediately registered a complaint.The good news is they seem to be smaller tissues, so, you don't feel compelled to keep reusing them to use the whole tissue up.And, of course, they are made of 100% recycled paper and I could not find any on the grocery store shelves.At this point, I don't plan to reorder them when I run out. I'm looking for a softer choice."
5,Holistic Health,"I became so engrossed with wanting to know all I could from Edgar Cayce that I have read most of his books and have even made a trip to Hopkinsville,KY , where he lived. I tell everyone who will listen about his castor oil packs. I use them on myself and my family with 100% success. I have healed myself of uterine tumors by following the advise on page 228.I receive instant relief from pain when I apply castor oil to ruff cuticles or hang nails. My son plays basketball and has had pulled muscles in his ankle and knee. I immediately apply a caster oil pack for a few hours and then he is fine.! I suggest that every household should have this book. Read it and apply what you read for a happier,healthier life."
4,Spiritual and Business-Savvy? Whodathunkit?,"I work for an A/V company who does small trade shows and pharmaseutical companies. I ordinarally fall asleep during these presentations, but when Kenny hit the stage with his understated enthusiasm and wisdom about how the bottom lines of profit and spirituality can come together -- and make both bottom lines go up for all concerned -- I was transfixed.All I do is run a sound board. I get a lot of free books from these shows, and to be honest I sell most of them on EBay.I am keeping this one."
4,Fascinating story about a gifted American doctor working in undeveloped countries,"An excellent true story but the writing style is somewhat repetitive, with many abbreviations and acronyms, sudden shifts of story from one time to another, and incomplete explanations of some events. Still I learned a lot about Haiti and will be interested in learning how Partners in Health has fared since the book was written."
4,Tracy Kidder does it again,"Tracy Kidder writes with real understanding of his subjects. From ""Soul of the New Machine"" to ""Old Friends"", his ability to understand his subjects at a very deep level comes through. Mounts Beyond Mountains is Tracy's best yet. I'd never heard of Paul Farmer when I started this book. Now I feel like I know and really understand him."
5,A Couch Pototoe's view,"I am 50, the same age as Dr. Farmer, but have lived a much different life (dull amd comfortable) than his. This book showed me a whole different way of living and it is the closest I'll ever be to seeing Haiti. It is very well written and I enjoyed every page. Made me feel somewhat guilty but plan to channel my guilt in productive ways. Recommend it highly."
2,Interesting Man - but way tooooooooo long,"I felt this book could have been written in half the pages and told the same story. It was interesting learning about World Health and the history of antibiotic resistent tuberculosis, but, again, the story could have been told with a lot less pages. Not a book that I couldn't put down."
4,A must read for those interested in mission fields or Haiti.,"We have worked in Haiti, the Caribbean, Africa and other LDC's for over 20 years. Mountains Beyond Mountains is excellent in bringing home the environment of working in Haiti and places like it. The book is not for the light-hearted. It is, however, a dynamic portrayal of what it is like to work in places that have none of the niceties of living in the U.S.The book is also eloquent in depicting the difference one determined (dedicated) person like Paul Farmer can make even in the most primitive of circumstances.Not a particularly easy read, but very informative."
4,A story of unconditional love,"The unborn babe in this story tells of the struggles of being in the rural Mississippi south. Her mother and father already have 5 boys and are struggling to make ends meet. Once the father finds out about the babe, he takes matters in his own hands, that's what they do in the South in this era. The father is the boss, and the mother goes along with the program. All while reading this book, I just knew at some point this child's mother would take a stand. She just had to for her own sake and for the babe sake and for her other children's sake. While reading this wonderfully written novel, just remember you are no longer in the 1990's, travel back with the author and this story will make good common sense to you."
4,R U Sure this was written by a man?!,What an interesting perspective! Gently insightful! Causes one to reflect on where we find OUR sources of strength; who is YOUR Ida Mae?
5,Great travel game!,We play this game in airpots and planes and on cruises. It's soooo portable and has enough options to hold our attention. It doesn't take a lot of space to play it either. It's become very hard to find as Mattel doesn't make it anymore but my mom and sister both want one to take when traveling. Works well with two or more players.
2,It was good but not good,"It was an 'okay' book. It had me interested by its description, but I was disappointed after reading it. It wasn't what I expected, and maybe that's why I didn't like it as much. The format of the book was confused until I began to recognize it. But I felt that the book was long and drawn out. The events in it were completely random at times. I'm guessing that's just is how the author writes, but I wasn't satisfied. It wasn't a bad book, but I wouldn't read it again."
3,Add a star if you're in love,"I'd really like to give this four stars, but I just can't quite do it. It has a lot going for it. It's more realistic than most science fiction movies or TV series you'll ever see. It brings up political issues, looking at both sides without clubbing you over the head with a single biased viewpoint. But gradually, we come to realize that the love story, which starts off as a subplot, turns out to be the main point of the series, a love story between a naive optimist (the female, of course) and the cynical pessimst. And the optimist ""wins.""Now, if I wrote the series, I'd focus on Fee (and possibly Edel), get rid the Chief and the Assistant Manager, and demote the romance between the young lovers to a subplot."
2,many better,This show repeats itself continuosly. the part on the ten plauges really strecthed some truths to fit it's agenda. I could not finish watching it. There are many more historical and better dvds out there. the parts about the skull they found [with Kent Weeks one of the best Egyptologist] was interesting but I could'nt watch the whole thing to find out who they decided it belonged to. someday I will finish it but not now.
3,Good airplane read,"This was a good easy read and not entirely predictable. However, it wasn't necessarily gripping or thought provoking. A good quick read to lighten things up in between more heavy books."
5,This is quite a story,"I always like to be surprised by a debut novel, and when it is a mystery novel, all the better. Mission Flats begins twenty years ago when a cop is murdered in a bar, and his killer commits suicide by jumping off the Tobin Bridge in Boston. Then we go to Versailles, Maine, to the murder of a Boston district attorney, found by Ben Truman, police captain a town where not too much happens. Back and forth to Maine and Boston, until we slowly learn how and why so many characters are linked. The ending was a knock-out surprise, and well done by the author. The mysteries and secrets in this book are exquisite for a debut novel, and you will not be able to rest until you know them all. The mark of a good book for me is that I thought about the characters for hours after I finished the book, and as a voracious reader I was not ready to start a new book until I could let them go."
3,"Interesting, But Not a Page Turner","Don't feel like I wasted my time reading this one, but it was easy to put down and return to later."
1,Bootleg,"This is a bootleg CD. As a member and founder of Maneige, I am asking you not to buy this. You will soon have the opportunity to buy this CD legally.Amazon should not be selling this, please take it out or we will have to take legal action.Alain Bergeron of Maneige"
4,A Beautiful First Novel,"In The Namesake Jhumpa Lahiri has transcended her immense short story writing abilities to compose a fine novel. I had previously read some of this novel (as portions of it were previously published as short stores in The New Yorker), but nevertheless found these chapters refreshing and fitting as parts to this novel. Lahiri's strength is that she does not dwell on plot; life happens and that is enough. The ups and downs of this family saga was illuminating not only this particular ethnic family, but emblematic of many (happy)families in the United States. What happens in this novel is that the namesake, the main character, learns to love and respect his family as he suffers their loss through the natural (including death)processes of time. Certainly this is enough of a ""plot"" for anyone to relate to without much trying."
3,INTERESTING STORYTELLING FROM THE QUEEN OF EMOTIONS!!,"Lahiri in the follow up for ""Interpreter of Maladies"" has a sophmore effort. As always she writes binding the reader's interest in her characters. She really gets into the hearts and minds of her characters. You get to hear their deepest thoughts,aspirations,motivations and fears. A good novel, but sometimes really seems a bit restrained. If you liked her prose, i would recommend reading another Indian author ArundhatiRoy's "" The God of small Things"" which has even more beautiful language."
2,sadly disappointed,"while the namesake is written well, it doesn't do much for making you care about any of the characters. it's very much a slice of life novel. this is what happened to gogol and that's all-- after all the raves i'd read about the first book i thought this one would be way better."
5,enchanting,I loved this book. I had seen the movie and was inspired to read the book and I was glad I did.
3,Much hyped and pretentious,After reading Lahiris first book I had lot of expectations about his book. And I read some rave reviews about this book as well. As an Indian immigrant living in the US and watching a few recetn movies about Asian Indians I found this book just stating the obvious. Narration of evey day life of second generation Indians and their parents. The book except for soem few occasions never goes inside the tribulations of characters. And the book becomes shallow and at some other places pretentious. I agree there are some good chapters in this book. And that is the reason I think Lahiri is a good short story writer and her language is refreshing.For a refreshingly simple and a highly enjoyable book I would recommend Monica Ali's Brick Lane which is short listed for the Booker prize this year.(It is a story of Asian immigrants in Britian similiar to this book)
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I found the cultural aspects of this book more interesting than the actual story. Although not Indian, I am close to the Indian community and finally understand why, when in India, I am asked for my ""good name"". I thought that the story was a little shallow at times and the motives behind the characters actions were not developed and understandable in a way I would have liked; but obviously, many people did not agree with me. I also did not feel a good sense of ""closure"" with the end. But, this is often the way it is in life. If you like books that mirror life, this is a good one. When I read, I like to escape from ""regular"" life and this book is a heavey dose of it.That being said, I do understand how so many people could enjoy the book. I did enjoy it, but probably would not bother to read anything else by the author if this is the typical style and story."
4,The Namesake,I liked this book for its window into the lives of people that are trying to live with two different cultures. It explores the different points of view very well. The americanized children that are embarrased by their differences. Also the immigrants who try to keep their traditions and beliefs intact. It was well written and easy to follow. You could sympathize with almost all the characters. Good book.
3,"Flawed, but worth reading","Jhumpa Lahiri describes the immigrant experience better than any writer I know. Her first effort, a collection of short stories, ""Interpreter of Maladies"", was wonderful. I read The Namesake as a short story (""Gogol"" in The New Yorker Magazine. I have to conclude that it was more effective in an abbreviated form than as a full length novel. I became bored with her lengthy descriptions of affluent upscale lives of Ivy League professionals. Although I get her point about the emptiness of it all, I think it went on too long. Still, the story held together and I could understand why the death of Gogol's father caused him to return to his Bengali roots and find new meaning in the customs and culture and his connectedness to his family. While a quick and enjoyable book to read, when it was over, I scarcely thought about it again."
2,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this book because I have many things in common with the Gogol character, including the fact that I came to the United States from an asian culture, changed my name as an adolescent, and struggled with fusing my native and adopted cultures. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the book. Its biggest flaw is that the narrative is so emotionally detached it is difficult to care about the characters. The best way to describe the author's writing style is ""clinical"". Too many unnecessary details about objects; not enough emotional development."
4,wonderful book,Detailed and precise in it's beauty. A simple story about complicated people. Well told and engaging.
2,Just blah,"I had high expectations for this book, but it was just blah. It's superficial, with no insight behind it. The author seemed to spend more time dreaming up outfits for her characters than substance for their personalities. I'm sorry to say this book was kind of a waste of time; it's the kind of writing you might appreciate to have, in a magazine, while you're waiting at the dentist's office...not something you'd like to see dragged out into a whole novel and paraded as literature. Blah."
2,in comparison to the great short story collection--not hot,"Paul Theroux, in his wonderful ""Sir Vidia's Shadow,"" recorded V. S. Naipaul carping about how most modern novelists are mere ""bringers of news."" well, here's Lahiri, bringing news too. i agree with the reader below who said he skipped--and i don't skip!--a load of this novel. ""Interpreter of Maladies""--i mean, i teach Literature at a major NY college--is real literature: lush, rich, ambiguous, deft, sweet, sour, ""teachable."" this novel's kind of a bore. you got the sense she plundered her own life instead of plumbed it. the most interesting character was the French major chick Gogol marries--and she's only in the book for fifty-odd pages. i wanted to like it so much. better luck next time, Jhumpa. i think she put this out just to get it out of the way, as it were. she'll recover."
4,"Compelling, but Maladies is better","Lahiri's command of the English language never ceases to amaze me. This novel is, like Interpreter of Maladies, very well written, using economical words that give the novel an excellent flow.Lahiri develops Gogol so completely that one cannot help but identify with him. He is the embodiment of the feelings everyone has had about his or her family and self at one point or another. The expereinces he goes through are unique to that of a child of immigrant parents, but Lahiri has the knack for making him accessible to all who share his journey.Ashima is my favorite character because of her journey into strength as she acclimates into the American culture.The story was fairly predictable, and at times I felt like nothing was happening. Having said that, I was still completely captivated by Lahiri's character development and prose; both kept me reading. I think that perhaps she is a better short story writer than novelist."
2,Lacked Emotion,"The story itself would have been very good and very compelling had the writing carried any emotional weight. Unfortunately, the great story was buried under needless details and written in such a way to provide no real connection to the characters."
2,ordinary people,"This is a novel about a very ordinary young man who, dispite his Indian heritage, lives a very ordinary life. His range of emotions runs from mildly horny to mildly bored. There is so little affect, in his life or in the book, that I would guess both are borderline depressed. Maybe the author's intent is to show how boring life in America is, compared to the crowded, occasionally dangerous life in India. If so, she misses her target. Certainly my life has been more interesting than Gogols."
4,Pulled me in.,"I listened to this book on CD and I'm glad I did. I think I would have been bored with it if I had read it -- lots of detail and not a lot of emotion. I enjoyed it nonetheless, due in no small part to the lovely accented voice of the narrator. Books like this that condense several generations into one volume make me depressed, though, as if I fear my own life will merit little more than a few chapters. And I wanted to tell Gogol, ""It's just a name -- get over it already!"" Still, I'm giving it a high rating for the clarity of the writing and the way the author was able to describe in such detail without boring me to tears."
3,Could have been better..,"Had heard a lot about this book, so decided to read it. But was really monotonous and too much simple and predictable. Perhaps it was because I had too much expectations out of it or maybe perhaps as I was Indian. Yeah, if you are Indian you may tend to relate urself. I guess females might like this book better. There was one touching moment in the book which I do not want to reveal, but that was the best. This was related to Gogols father, whose character is just around, but gives a emotional moment towards the end where you really like him. Other than that I did not find the book worth more than 3 stars good."
3,Read the first half,"Lahiri's novel is a good read, at least the first half. Her command of the language and the extra work she had to do in researching '70s and '80's America with Bengali context is really remarkable. The first half beautifully portrays the trials and tribulations first generation immigrants go through. Later on as the story progresses, Lahiri looses track of the characters and then it becomes pages and pages of mostly meaningless chatter. It is difficult to understand what Gogol really is running away from (apart from his name and hating large Bengali parties with food- what is that he does not like?). The story dwells too much on Mouse (and her bizarre world) and does not do any credit for Gogol's sister Sonia who is banished from the novel very easily. I just wish that Lahiri had a little more grasp on the second half which would have made this a novel a must read for immigrant kids."
2,an unworthy successor,"It is difficult to believe that the writer of ""Interpreter of Maladies"" is the same as the author of this novel. The book starts off interestingly enough, describing Gogol's(the main character) parents, their arranged marriage in Calcutta, and their emigration to America. We then fly through his birth, school years and college years as if the author was in a race to get to the more ""juicy"" bits of the character's lives. The book then becomes sort of a soap opera, with the characters falling into one cliched scene after another. Hopefully Lahiri's next effort will return to the quality of her prize winning first book."
4,Excellent,I loved the story. She writes in a way that draws the reader right into the culture and people of the story. It is an excellent book.
4,this woman can WRITE,"it's the most addicitive book i've read in a long time. while i agree to a certain extent with the reviewer who says it lacks direction, the writing is so superb and the story so engrossing it's kind of hard to care. a noteworthy talent."
5,Surprise Favorite,"Like many other reviewers of this book, I read Interpreter of Maladies, Lahiri's Pulitzer-Prize-winning short story collections, several years ago. Yet I'm going to differentiate myself here a little and say that I, personally, enjoyed The Namesake more. I remember admiring the technical panache with which Lahiri drove her stories, but it didn't grab me. The Namesake, on the other hand, did from the very beginning.It's true that the majority of The Namesake's action occurs internally. I think this kind of writing is tricky for many writers, but Lahiri succeeds in infusing each paragraph with so much astute, colorful description that her intense focus on what could be mundane detail never slips into tiring reading.I would recommend this book to anyone, and plan to use it as a reminder to concentrate more on detail in my own writing."
2,this is a terrible book,"This is one of the more self-absorbed and narrow narratives of an ""immigrant"" experience i have read. Being the child of exactly what Gogol's parents are - Indians, and Bengalis at that - I can say that the book represents a narrow and uninteresting view of one ""immigrant"" family on the US East Coast. The book is totally geographically biased, is conservative and pretentious (wouldn't it have been more interesting if Gogol got the flu before his SAT and didn't make it into Yale and was stuck at the community college, thereby interacting with a different demographic and having a *real* experience that might have made his life INTERESTING and emotionally challenging?). Boring boring boring. By the way, has anyone noticed that Gogol isn't really an immigrant? He's just as American as the next person. There's no struggle, there's no adversity, there's just self-absorbed shame. Pathetic."
3,Only for Mensa members,"This is by far the least user-friendly drumming book I have purchased, and I am already having to order something to replace it with. There are no specific links between the book and the cd (such as ""Track 1 - 16ths,"" etc.). I looked high and low for track numbers next to the written music, to no avail. Incredibly convoluted presentation of text -- lengthy, single-spaced paragraphs, often with musical notations distributed throughout, as opposed to setting it apart from the text. I am giving it 3 stars rather than 1 only because it is possible I am simply not smart enough to figure it out. Fortunately, there are so many user-friendly books out there, I won't have to tear my hair out trying to make heads or tails out of this one."
4,What my child wanted,"This product was what my child was looking for and found it here, fast shipment, item as described."
2,Just out of date,The exercises are impossible to follow if you are a new maya user. The book is optimized using version 5. The tool commands in 8.5 are completely different.
1,lacking information,"I really regret purchasing this book. I thought that I was purchasing a great book that can't go wrong from reading other reviews. However, what I got was a book filled with information that can be found on other Maya books. You can easily purchase other Maya book and cut out all the Nurb section, and this book is what you get. I am very disappointed."
1,Never buy from Amazon,"It took me about a month to find out I was never going to get my product.The company sent the wrong item,then I had to return it.It took two weeks before they said they received it.Then they said they don't have any and will not order more ""pick something else from our site"" they said. I am still waiting for my credit card to be credited.I placed the order on 03-16-10 and as of 04-17-10 I have not gotten my money back!Amazon wants some of the profit from these vendors but does nothing to help,I complained to Amazon but they only forward (automatically)to the vendor they don't even read it.I think this whole thing is a ""bait and switch""I am afraid I can't rate this product because ""I NEVER GOT IT"" or my money so far.Amazon is a POS."
1,Downward spiral,"Oh, man, this is rough. The debut was OK, the second was middling sophomore slump, and now, this third one is just ghastly - a real mess and a total letdown. What glimmer of talent on display on the first record has been replaced by flat, tuneless, and totally bland riffs in search of song structure and hooks that never come. Did you see the lead singer try to ""sing"" on SNL? Sadly, he looks cool in his para-military peacoat and touseled rockstar hair, but the guy cannot carry a tune, for real. Out of key yelping is a understatement. Just painful to listen to. Why bother? Make this CD a coaster."
4,Currently the greatest rock band...,"To speak frankly, when i listened their last album's single ""Juicebox"" it was a little dissapointing for me since the sound was more-less like most of the current bands. Also the fact that Gordon Raphael did not produce this album had me with a lot of doubts regarding the album's quality. Fortunately i can say that after listening to the album I can say that The Strokes still are the greatest rock band today. And i will always be grateful to The Strokes because thanks to them, rock and roll is still alive despite the tendency to push foward hip hop and soul music by the guys from MTV, the only reason we can still tune to rock radio stations is because of The Strokes, Interpol and The white Stripes, and The Strokes opened the door to the rest of the good bands to be listened and enjoyed. Congratulations Julian Casablancas for your album, THE STROKES ARE STILL THE GREATEST OF THEM ALL!!!!!!"
2,Worst Impressions,"First off, let me say I liked the Strokes' first two albums and I think they put on a great live show. Now, as for this new album, blah. The Strokes are good at short, simple, fun songs. Their first two albums were quick and to the point, the songs were around three minutes long, and both albums were under 40 minutes. This new one just goes on and on, the songs are long, drawn out and pointless, and the band's fun energy has been replaced by annoying screaming. Aside from a few highlights, this album is a bummer and a step back for the band. See what happens when you hang out with Drew Barrymore too long?"
2,"ehh, nothing special",their first album was still the best. This ones seems to have one catchy song and a bunch of filler. Seemed to be produced just to put something out there
2,I Almost Had a Stroke!,"Ok, so I've only listened to this album once and because it's The Strokes I'll listen to it again and again because I want to like it. It kind of reminds me of when I heard The Cure's ""The Top"" for the first time...I couldn't believe the boys actually thought that album was worth producing at all. I loved ""Is This It"" immediately. Not so with ""Room on Fire"" but it grew on me. This one, well we will see. I will give it another shot after I have recovered from the shock."
5,STROKESSSSSSSSS!! WOOOOO!!!,"NEW ALBUM MARCH 22, 2011!!! and maybe.... A TOUR!!!!!!!!!!!! YEAHHHHH STROKESSSS WOOOOOOOOOOO.oh yeah. buy this album. you will NOT regret it."
2,Boring.,It's no accident this CD was released on 1/3/06. It's a total dog. I am a pretty big fan of the band and I was very underwhelmed by this CD. Better luck next time.
3,Not bad,"This album is starting to settle in with me after the fourth or fifth listen. When i heard that the strokes were going to shake things up on their new album i became excited with it, Ive always liked the band but felt they could use some more variance in the song writing. Then after hearing the corny juicebox bassline and reading luke warm reviews i started to become cynical towards the release. I bought it expecting to be underwealmed, but after listening to it a few times i decided it's about as good as anything theyve done. One complaint is the length. In their first two releases the albums were tight and to the point. This album has alot more fat. I find mself getting bored with the album somewhere around track eight. They shouldve cut a few songs namely fear of sleep and red light and maybe a few others.If you enjoy their first two albums and want more Strokes then by all means pick this up. If your looking to get into the strokes then I wouldnt start here."
5,Excellent Album,"This is an outstanding album. Every track is well written, and the music is excellent. I would certainly recommend this to any fan of The Strokes, or any fan of punk/rock music, you won't be disappointed. I found myself especially drawn to the track ""Ask me anything"". It is hauntingly beautiful and simplistic."
3,"Mostly great, with some really lackluster tracks","When this album came out, it was highly anticipated by me. 'Is This It?' and 'Room on Fire' were (and still are) staples in my listening library and I loved the hell out of them. When the Juicebox single dropped, I was pumped and loved the song.Too bad for me that, unlike the first two albums, I couldn't listen to this one from front to back. Songs like 'Ask Me Anything' and 'Ize of the World' light speakers ablaze with great ferocity, but drab crap like 'On The Other Side' and 'Fear of Sleep' just bring the entire record down. Those tracks, plus 'Red Light' and '15 Minutes' are skipped over continually. How were they included, but the highly superior b-side 'Hawaii' (available on the Juicebox single CD and LP) was left off the record? Truly perplexing.Still a good record, but they definitely stumbled a bit in the song-writing and composing."
3,shoequeen,I like these shoes but will not buy this kind again. They are comfortable for a little while but not for the long hall. Once they are broken in they still make my feet hurt after 3 hours
2,Painful but cute,"Despite being adorable, these clogs are pretty painful after a couple of hours--the band on top is just too tight. I wear a 7.5M, so I'm pretty sure my feet aren't too wide."
3,"transformsers are cool, but......","okay, this story took off rather fast and it was kind of compicated. then there were other side stories that could have been left out but needed them to explain how powerful Soundwave and Starscream really are. other than all the type-o's this book didn't make sense. is the story line taking off from the comics or the show? from the comics then, does it happen before vol. 2? a timeline would have been nice. thats why i gave it a 3, uknown timeline and a choppy story. maybe the next two books will set this ""foundation"" straight."
2,"Good clock/timer, poor durability and craftsmanship","We found this timer easy to use (good thing as no instructions came with it.) However, buyer be warned! The magnet on the back is NOT strong enough to hold the timer's own weight and the product as a whole is poorly constructed. One drop from a height of 4 feet onto the kitchen floor from the front of our fridge and this timer was toast. Half of the numbers ceased operation. After this little accident I took it upon myself to dismantle the timer and take a look inside. Sure enough the display was made of a very fragile glass and ample cushioning was not designed into the product. Only one side (the top) of the display was protected with shock absorbent material. As you can guess ours did not land top side up. To sum up: nice little device, just don't ever drop it and expect it to keep working."
2,Too complicated for quick use,"All I wanted is a simple digital timer. Bless him, my husband got me this. I have figured it out, but without instructions, it was -- and is -- not intuitive. Every time I use it, I have to remind myself how. That is a problem when you are trying to quickly time things. And now, after a year of barely using it, the battery is dead . . ."
4,Good show,"My son bought this and says, ""These shows are funny, silly, and Dez always messes things up. This season is better than season 2 by a little bit."""
5,Focused and Centered,"Dear Charles. I have reviewed your music and find it very focused and centered in the energy of life as I know it. It would make wonderful hatha yoga background music for those who like music during their practice. It is relaxing and at the same time inspiring. Peace My Friend. -- Matthew Hall, yoga instructor"
1,poor quality table,"I read reviews before buying this table on 6/12/12. When it arrived, the edges were damaged in multiple areas. We installed because it was meant for my son. The drawer fell apart the next day. I still didn't mind, my son didn't mind. I then noticed the legs were wobbly, to cut the long story short, 1 leg broke off 3 days ago, the wood crumbled and split from the rest of the table in an unrepairable way (less than 6 weeks). $100.00 down the drain. I have bought a lot of things using amazon so I can't complain about them but this table is a fake and a rip off. My feeling is that this company made and sold a few good quality tables to get good reviews and then shipped out fake ones . When it comes to furniture, I will prefer to go into a store and see what I am getting from now on."
3,"Good, but few imperfections","The item arrived in relatively good condition, but I did see a few scratches on the surface of the desk and on the keyboard tray. I also noticed that the desk tends to scratch fairly easily. Assembling it was no problem at all and took very little time which is good. The one annoying thing about the keyboard tray is that it doesn't stay shut all the time (the magnet that holds the tray closed is kind of weak, so it just pops open if you were to bump into the desk or something)."
4,Some flaws but a good deal,"Well, I was a little wary purchasing this, having read all the reviews about desks being chipped, poor staining, etc. This desk is pretty cheap, so I wasn't expecting perfection. One leg was badly stained, but I put that one in the back, where no one will ever see it except me. There is a small gouge in the front, but you wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for it. So the verdict is...yes, there were some flaws but you get what you pay for."
4,Pretty nice desk for the money,"I received my desk recently and am pretty pleased with it so far. The real reason I am mainly reviewing this item is because I had read reviews prior to purchasing it where seemingly a lot of customers received the desk in a somewhat damaged condition...I am happy to report that I received the desk in perfect new condition, with no dings or scratches. I am very mechanically challenged and even I could assemble this desk in just under 30 minutes, super easily...Amazon is a very prompt shipper and this desk probably took a day longer than what I had expected, but that was no big deal and it is just as likely that this desk did not really take long.....is just that most Amazon orders ship really really fast.I would totally recommend this desk to a friend who wanted an inexpensive, very attractive desk without all the bells and whistles that tend to take up more space...A very nice buy overall"
3,"Very nice, yes, but wood... I don't think so...","I liked this desk, as well as the mission ones, so I went to Target to check them out. I didn't think you could get a solid wood desk for the price... and I was right. The ones they had on display were chipped in the corners and one of the legs, so you could see that it isn't solid wood.They look nice, though. Just be aware that it isn't solid wood, that's a lie."
5,I'm a convert,"After 25+ years of listening to R&B (yes, I'm a black woman) and hating rap (it all sounds alike to me), I switched my TV one day and saw a Toby Keith video. I could actually understand everything the man was trying to say and could empathize with the lyrics. It was then I questioned my loyalty to a kind of music that I'd heard all my life and was determined, 'I'm not going country', but that was 6mos ago and I am proud to say I am a huge fan of Toby Keith. (Toby, please come to Raleigh, NC - SOON).I'd pay to see you in concert. I am working my way thru your album history and I must say I am deeply impressed. I don't believe the Greatest Hits covers it. 'Yet' should have been on there as well as many others. I am giving your newest CD 5 stars, if I could give 10 I would. Forget the critics, keep on doing your thing YOUR WAY. If they could come up with music as heartfelt and as touching as yours - THEY'D DO IT. Looking forward to more music, more videos, just more..... a big fan"
4,A Great Mixture,"Tender deep lyrics, line up next to Ho Down stomping up beat tunes on this wonderful album. The title track that was a top selling single and many other tracks herein mark a real step in the right direction for Toby. Not that his previous offerings were in any way poor, but the mixture of tempo's, lyrical content, and great instrumentals seems to elevate him to the next level. If you have never heard of Toby Keith, or your thinking of sampling his music - BUY THIS ALBUM."
2,I like you better when you're funny,"The title track is the Keith I enjoy. A little bravado and a whole lot of tongue firmly planted in cheek. The earnest country singer of ""When Love Fades"" and ""You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like That"" (This one sounds like a Meatloaf reject) pale in comparison to the cowboy of ""Country Comes to Town."" I like the way Keith works a song like ""Hold You, Kiss You, Love You,"" with the emphasis on vocals and selling the idea, but the overall effect sounds like something any country artist could put together. The problem here is there are far too many traditional sounding country songs and not enough of the songs that make Keith stand apart from the pack."
1,Too heavy weight,"Great idea but too heavy weight. The buckle on the belt was very large, heavy, and metal. It was difficult to latch and unlatch. If you have a large waist 40 inches or larger the belt will not wrap around you comfortably. I was not able to use product and it has been sitting on the shelf."
5,New Training pads,"This is a fantastic product. I have an elderly cat who now refuses to potty in his litter box which is very odd. So, I use these so that he doesn't have to climb into a box. Poor babe. He's 17 now."
1,This has been changed,This used to last really long and durable but they somehow changed this pad.. They are no longer thick and good quality..I don't think I won't use this anymore.
1,NEW PAD IS TERRIBLE,"They have clearly changed the pads to save money... these new pads have essentially the thickness and absorption of a paper towel with a plastic backing... Not only do you have to replace it much much more frequently, they no longer capture the smell or for that matter the urine... Why would Four Paws do something so terrible with their brand?"
2,Clancy's version of the truth??? Yeah right....,I Bought the book for it's cover and enjoyed the quotes in the front of the book.... Too bad Clancy couldn't follow up!!! ...
1,Who wrote this book? It is truly awful,"TERRIBLE!Teeth of the Tiger reads like a tepid first draft of a screenplay written for Ben Affleck.As an avid Clancy fan, I found intial rumblings that he may use a ghost writer far fetched. After reading this joke, I'm sure that they are true."
1,The End of the Line,"There comes a time when one decides to say enough.I have read most of Tom Clancy's novels. Many I enjoyed; the rest I finished.His latest offering, The Teeth of the Tiger, is one of the latter.As I read his latest offering, I tried to remind myself that fiction can serve as an effective vehicle to vet controversial ideas. But alas, the untenable coincidences, a premise which in my mind borders on treason and the mind-numbing narrative finally got to me. I finished this book; I will not be starting his next one."
5,The Teeth of the Tiger (Jack Ryan),"Even men have their special characters they love to read about, my husbandLOVES the Jack Ryan books by Tom Clancy...thanks again for the sale, Amazon.com!"
5,I can't believe all the negative reviews:,"I thought this book was great!The FBI agent's killing of the bad guy was plausible and probably happens more than law enforcement officials would like us to know.The method of dispatching the ""bad guys"" was innovative, discrete, and very possible. IMHO, a method such as this would be the best way to deal with the terrorists. The United States would not have to publicly ""get their hands dirty"", so to speak, yet the terrorist community would get the message.I couldn't put this book down. Just very simply, a great book. A complex, yet easy to follow, plot; very realistic bad guys in our turf finally get taken out; and then their bosses get taken out one by one; what's not to like?I'm a mature, level-headed guy; an (mechanical, machine design) engineer by training; and this was a great read. If it interests you, by all means get it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.Dave"
2,Repetition,"I have been a fan and until this book a first day buying of all the previous Clancy books (it took two days to arrive). That behavior stops with this book. I noticed in the past couple books that Clancy had his characters repeating sayings that other characters said previously. This book followed that behavior but even more so. Similar to teacher, Clancy wants to preach certain ideas and feels that the readers are students that much hear concepts multiple times before it sinks in. At other times his characters seemed to be repeating to others the same reports multiple times. That may be necessary in real life but it felt that Clancy or his editors where just trying to boost the word count of this novel that compared to most of his past work was thin in page count. After completing this book I came to the conclusion that it likely was either intended as a TV pilot or that will be its eventual goal. I don't think it was good enough for theatrical movie production."
1,Fan Exploitation,"I've read most of Clancy's work and this book seems to dwell on all of the things Clancy does poorly, such as character development. I cringed through most of the book as I plodded through tortured dialog, hoping to get to action sequences that only came at the end."
2,Routine & Boring,"This was a great premise for a book but Clancy wasted it. Thank goodness, he stopped at 480 pages. If it had been any longer, I would have wanted the twins to use the poison pen on me intead of the villians. Basically Ex-President Ryan set up a private agency to kill bad guys. The head of the agency recruits Ryan's nephews(twins no less) to be the killers . One a FBI agent the other a Marine Captain. and his son to identfy who needs to be killed. The two Caruso Brothers have their real names and then they have their ""nicknames"" they use just between themselves, but there is no consistancy. so half the time the reader is unsure who is taliking and who he is talking to.After saying this, I am sure this will be a run-away bestseller, because Clancy has hopped on the ""Kill The Bad Arabs"" bandwagon.To sum it all up. This book is a confusing mis-mash with a wasted premise"
2,Sadly disappointed,"I never thought I would say this about a Clancy book but I feel ripped off by this book. This one should be called ""Teeth of the Tiger, Part 1"" since it obviously stops in the middle of the story. If I didn't know better, I would swear that Clancy wanted to get the book on the market but just didn't know how to bring it to a close.I have every one of his other books & have enjoyed them immensely (I've read each of them at least 3 times each). I don't expect to be re-reading this one anytime soon.Will I buy the next Clancy book? At this point, I really don't know. Maybe I'll read a copy from the library & before spending my money since I don't feel that this one was worth it.Sorry, Tom, but you'll have to try harder next time."
3,It's not THAT bad . . .,"I was somewhat surprised to see the overwhelming negative nature of the reviews for ""The Teeth of the Tiger."" Frankly, it's not that bad, even if not up to the usual Clancy standard. My biggest complaint is that it seemed to be about half of a normal Clancy novel. If it were bulked up with a more complex plot and more action, it would easily rate four stars. Let's hope that we see a better effort next time."
3,Not Typical Clancy,"I found this book to be fairly entertaining and a quick read. The plot is straight forward and timely, given the current terrorist threat. However, this book is not the typical detailed, plot twisting, Tom Clancy novel. The Ryan continuation is a tad hokey, but he does an admirable job separating the experience of Jack Jr. from his cousins. I would suggest this book as a read, but spend your money on the paperback or check it out from the library. This is not on par with his earlier work."
1,The Teeth of the Tiger,"I have read nearly all of Clancy's books. This book reminds me of some of the paperbacks that Clancy has co-written, except that this story is not that interesting. The plot had some potential, but it seemed that Clancy was in such a hurry to end the story, that the story was never was developed completely."
2,Incredibly Crude Propaganda,"and only half a book at that!For years now every Clancy book has been a sales job, and this book seems to be selling:hatred of Arabs;good feelings about universal wiretapping; andgood feelings about systematic assassinations.Clancy also solemnly reassures us:that the CIA has never ever had any capability for assassination (though he admits that it has a covert ops section);that the FBI has never done anything illegal (htough he admits that it has a huge collection of blackmail files); and, best of all,that John Kennedy was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald, acting all by himself.His storytelling skills are pleasant, but maybe a graphic novel would be a better way to reach an audience with the credulity he seems to long for?And this is only half a book - the plot just stops in midair - pretty shoddy."
3,Not his best work,This book is just okay. It is like his op-center books. As far as I am concerned this is an imcomplete book. It ends far to soon. He should have written at least another 100 pages. I am a huge fan of Tom Clancy and have purchased and read all of his books but this book just does not measure up. It is a good read but he makes to many references to his other books and events which have taken place since Jack Ryan left the office as President. He should have written a book about this or at least completed this one. This book leaves you hanging in a very incomplete way. He should have done better.
3,Disappointment,"As an avid Clancy fan, I always look forward to the next book, and this time was no different. I bought the book the day it came out. Teeth of the Tiger surprises you right away, because of the lack of heft that the usual Clancy book has. It seemed like something he just slapped together instead of the usual 15 subplots that get tied together perfectly at the end. Being the fan I am, I'll have to give him a pass on this one, and hope he snaps out of it for the next book."
3,"Almost back, and with a new cast of characters!","Oh how I wanted to write ""Welcome Back Tom!"" but I can't, YET. Although 'The Teeth of the Tiger' is considerably better than 'Red Rabbit', it isn't on par with Mr. Clancy's earlier work. And I have read every one of them. His recent novels seem to have serious pacing problems. Red Rabbit took forever and was repetitious to a fault. Teeth of the Tiger started out well, and continued in the Clancy tradition of building up interest and tension right up to the pivotal passage, the simultaneous terrorist attacks in America's heartland, and then inexplicitly the story drove off a cliff...."
1,Very disappointing - Seems someone pulled Tom's teeth,"I have been an avid Clancy fan since Red October, and have really enjoyed where he went with the Ryan series through ""Bear"". ""Teeth"" however is a mess. Poorly edited, bad dialogue (Sheesh Tom enough with the nicknames already)and lackluster action. I do not understand also why he had to make the Ryan universe match our own. There is nothing wrong with alternate history, and he had already created such a rich and fleshed out timeline. Retroactively adding 9/11 into this made no sense and is a very jarring shift.With ""Teeth"" Clancy has forever damaged the world he has created and I am saddened by that. I will never look forward to a Clancy novel with the same anticipation again."
1,so that's it??,"Yes, his other novels are way better, my favorite still being the Cardinal of the Kremlin. Anyways, this book was OK, BUT when I finished it, I was feeling like there should have been another chapter to tie everything together into an ENDING. I've gotten more closure from each Harry Potter book, and I already knew there would be another one coming!!"
1,Pass on this one,This is the worst Tom Clancy book I have read. I have read almost all of them. There is no ending! The book just stops.
2,"Improving, but not there yet","Tom Clancy has rebouded from his low. ""The Teeth of the Tiger"" is an improvement on the dissapointing ""Red Rabbit"". Still, the books reads more like notes from an European vacation trip ( with a few deaths, along the way) , than the witty novels that Clancy produced in the late 80's and early 90's.I recommend the book for those Tom Clancy die hards ( like me ), but for everybody else, you can skip it."
1,So boring,"Clancey seems to decline with each new book.""Teeth of the Tiger"" is a new low. Slow paced and really quite boring. This book is a stinker - well below one star!As another reviewer questioned -- how could this book pass muster by any professional editor remains an open ended question.I have a sneaking suspicion that the meaningless descriptions of European cities, hotels, and restaurants in this book was solely justified by Clancey's desire to write off a European vacation as a business expense.I think it is very clear we are witnessing the ""death"" of an author through hubris and success, added and abetted by uncaring editors. Whether Clancey will ever have another good book within him is becoming highly questionable"
