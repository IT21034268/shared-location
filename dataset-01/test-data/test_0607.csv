5,GREAT ITEM.....BUT PRICE HAS GONE UP!,"I purchased this neat vacuum before Christmas and we think it is amazing. It works really good and has a whole lot of suction power. I would highly recommend. In fact I liked it so much I want to buy another for a Daughter, but the price has gone up almost $10.00 since we purchased it...so giving it some thought now?"
1,Good until it wears out - then it's a disaster,"The good reviews about this vac are from people whose batteries haven't worn out yet. Yes - it's a very strong vacuum and picks up and traps fine particle dust. It's screams like a banshee while it's doing it though. The real problem with this machine comes when its battery life is over. That's when you discover that the battery is hard wired to the motor and the only way to replace it is buy a motor/battery combo which costs more than the original unit. As you can imagine, not many replacements are sold - so the consequence is, after a couple years use, the 'sucker' is going to spend how many hundred years in a land fill? And who's gonna clean that up?"
2,clogs too easily and emptying is a pain,"I purchased two of these for my business based on the good reviews and lower priced compared to the Dyson. Yes the battery life is good and when it's not clogged, it sucks well. But I dread using this vacuum because half the time I have to fish out the debris from the nozzle and/or canister. The nozzle will regularly just fill up with garbage. The canister is much smaller than the dyson and the cone filter has a fabric texture that sticks to the debris. Like another reviewer wrote, emptying this vacuum is a real drag."
1,"A big, loud, heavy disappointment","If you don't want to waste your time reading my review here, just look at any of the other 1- and 2-star reviews on this site, which all basically state how I feel about this piece of junk. Wear your ear plugs while you use it, and remember that louder doesn't necessarily equal better. A horrible design concept -- as several other reviewers have mentioned, cat litter rarely makes it up the nozzle and into the cylinder, which, as several other reviewers also mentioned, is a royal pain to empty and clean. I wish that I could return it, but alas, the box has been discarded. BUT!...if I lose one of my 5-lb hand weights, this would be an acceptable substitute."
5,Expensive Book,This book is well written and the pictures are great. The price is a bit steep though. I recommend first checking it out at your local library if you live in a larger city as I did and then decide if it is worth the cost.
4,Fan that does its job,"I got this fan from a friend and have used it ever since to either keep air moving at my desk, or to cool my computer. It has worked fine and continues to blow a steady stream of air. The oscillation feature works as well, albeit with a little ""squeak"" on each pass (probably something that could be fixed with a little WD-40), but since I find oscillation on a tiny desk fan to be pointless, I really don't care."
2,"Nice design, but noisy","I bought this retail a few years ago. The air flow is good, the design is nice. Plenty of air flow, but if you can hear, this is not the fan for you. It's not especially load, but the vibration noises from the plastic parts is extreme;y noisey. You certainly cannot use this near you if you are on the phone alot."
5,"Good air flow, quiet operation","I'm pretty happy with this fan. I replaced a different small desktop tower type fan with this one. The old fan was just too noisy. This is much quieter. I like the ""split fan"" feature with oscillation that spreads the air flow over a broader area. Works for me!"
3,Better off with a Tower fan,Pros-doesn't take much space up on the desk-Settings-Good designCons-Doesn't cool the air only pushes it-The strongest setting is pretty noisy and doesn't do that much-Any setting lower than the strongest is entirely useless in any real heatYour'e far better off with just getting a tower fan.
4,NDE and spiritual experiences.,I was intereseted in this book after reading Raymond Moody's book The Light Beyond. I wanted to see what the Mormon outlook on this topic was. It contains many experiences of individuals who have NDE/Spiritual experiences. It has inhanced my belief in the afterlife.
4,Jumbo Folding Shopping Cart,This cart is excellent for carrying large items. I have the use of one hand and it was easy to assemble. The only problem is a strong toxic smell being omitted from the rubber tires. I'll store it outdoors.
4,Shopping Cart,"The cart seemed fragile as we put it together, but as we found where all the cotter keys went, it started to take shape and performs well. We are senior citizens and we use it for hauling groceries from the car into the house. A couple of cotter keys fell out and we couldn't figure out where they came from but that didn't seen to have any effect on its capabilities."
2,wheels fell off...,so after taking about 45 min to put this together the first time I wheel some sports equipment in it the front wheels came off. so now just wheel it around on 2 wheels.
1,This company does not sell Easy Wheels Shopping Cart,"This company does not sell Easy Wheels products. Don't be fooled. Feel free to buy their carts but remember, you are not getting Easy Wheels Shopping Cart."
1,Nintendo DS Headset,"Nintendo DS Headset is very bulky, and big it keeps falling off. Unless you're planning not to move around. You're going to have to sit up or if you like stand up. I tried to give it to my 11 year daughter, she gave it back to me with a (I don't think so Mom). I don't want to give it any stars.S. Finley"
3,Useful but uncomfortable,The Headset is very useful(especially if your DS Microphone breaks) but It doesn't quite fit comfortably around one's ear.
4,Travel information,"On a cruise next year, we will be able to spend 9 hours in Tallinn, Estonia. Since we have never been there before, I found this book to be very helpful with a map of the city and interesting places to visit. It was also interesting to read the history about a country so far away. I feel prepared for our trip."
2,"Bradt Guide to Estonia, 2nd edition","This book was neither a satisfactory travel guide nor history/cultural guide to Estonia. While trying to be both, it was neither. I was looking for more specific information that a tourist would need for visiting Tallinn and the countryside, ie ferry information, shopping, more on accommodation.Also the quality of the publication (paper & graphics) was very disappointing. I found the Lonely Planet Guide to Scandinavia & the Baltic States to be more helpful and certainly of a much better quality"
2,Ok Telephone,The phone worked great for about a year then it was all downhill. I had to replace the battery after about 9 months and shortly after a year the on and off buttons stopped working. I could answer the phone via the speaker button but had extreme dificulties hanging the phone up. I generally like Motorola products but this phone was pretty bad.
3,"Nice deck, but didn't resonate with me","This is a great deck; it comes in a handy recipe box and comes with a booklet, covering the various spreads and meanings of the cards. The cards themselves are a perfect size; great for little hands! The only problem I had is that it was hard for me to read these without help from the booklet. I couldn't look at the picture and get any intuitive information from it. I'm sure many will have no problem with it, it is still a great deck, but for me personally, they were more difficult to read."
1,Avoid like the plague,"I bought one of these for my daughter for $119. Total ripoff...it's unplayable. The pads don't seal and one of the keys closes when another one is pushed. The problem is that on a REAL flute, that isn't supposed to happen. It's pretty and shiny, but sounds dreadful. She had to use it at band camp for a couple of days while waiting for her Gemeinhardt to come in the mail and was so frustrated that she nearly quit band. I wish that I had read some reviews before I bought it because it was a complete waste of money."
4,Its sweet,If your little one loves Ariel she will love this. Its very sweet but a little too loud so do not bring out to dinner.
1,Disappointed Little Tikes Fan,"We have always been thilled with our Little Tikes purchases in the past, but this one was awful.The first issue is my fault... I assumed that the legs would come off for storage and they do not. You have to screw them in place, which is quite a task in itself.The second issues is the castle is tricky to get together with my 27 year old hands. It must be taken apart and reassembled _each_ time you use the table because the lid does not close with it together.It is such a hassle to play with (clean up and set up are such a bother) it sits rotting in our backyard.I bought this for 90% off, but I would not do it again. It was so not worth it.Save your money, get one of those frog sand boxes."
2,A four alarm blaze of silliness,"In between the release of the inconsequential albums ""Knocked Out Loaded"" and ""Down in the Groove,"" Bob Dylan lent his talents, or rather his name and image, to this even more inconsequential and exceptionally silly film. It's about as bad as the worst rock and roll movie (such as almost anything made by Elvis from 1965-67), but worth a look if only to hear Dylan answer a hotel employee's question, ""Would you like flowers in your room?"" with these words: ""Yes, I'd like some pansies."""
1,it didn't work,it did not work they said that it is my PDA i dont see why they just dont send me a new one. They just keep tryiny to help me with emails i just want a new one or my money back you get what you pay for
3,Has so much potential,"This book does have great information! There is no doubt about that. If you are a beginnner to digital, this would not be a bad book to start with.With that said, I wish the book had been set up better. It is all black and white which doesn't work well when you are trying to see the difference between various settings. In the middle of the book is a colored section with the example photos in full color, but flipping to that all the time is a true pain in the bum!I did return this book back to Amazon due to my disappointment.For THE BEST book on producing high quality images, I would recommend Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson."
3,Good - Not Great...Audiobook Review,"This is my Steven Womack book, so I can't compare it to any of his others.The narrator was fine - no complaints there.Murder Manual did not grab my attention right away - very important for me.It was a slow start.But I normally give books at least an hour before I chuck them.I did get drawn into the story and wanted to know how it was going to turn out.But it was way to wordy for me.I say that quite a bit in my reviews, but, not all reviews.Sometimes authors are just TOO descriptive on:I thought this, and then I thought it againThe walls look like this and the ceiling looks like thisAnd then I said this and then I told her I said thisI wonder what she was thinkingWas she thinking thisI had to fastforward and didn't miss anything.If that doesn't bother you, then you will enjoy the story more than I did.I give it a 4 for the premise of the story.I had to fast forward and would not ever read it or listen to it again, so I gave it a 3."
1,soul catcher,this video was boring and not at all enjoyable. rent this movie first and you will see that it is not worth buying
3,3511 Watch,"I ordered & returned this watch. The watch is of very good quality-but I wanted a watch with a white face but this one actually has a silver face. Thus, I returned it.The service from this seller was very, very good.Super fast shipment & willing to work with me on the return."
4,The New Testament Review,"Just a few chapters into this book, I could already tell that this will not only be an asset for a class I am currently attending on the Synoptic Gospels, but more importantly, an asset to my personal library that I will be able to refer to for years to come."
2,The book that would never arrive,When I bought the textbook I was given the arrival date and then I waited.... the book finally arrived 2 weeks AFTER the arrival date. No biggie because it came in great condition but still...
2,A College Religion Textbook -- Not for Believers,"This book is written for a college religion environment. It is patently secular and is unsatisfactory as a choice for a believing student.Much of the book is wasted on Markan priority and source criticism which detracts from the flow and logic.There are so many great NT introductions and surveys, that this book does not even fall into the category of ""buy also."""
3,Shiny plastic coated cards,"They may be vintage, but they are unopened, cello wrapped. The cards are shiny, slippery, plastic coated. If this is what you like, then you will be pleased. It wasn't what I was expecting from vintage, but they'll do. They come with easy to understand instruction sheet. If you don't like the suggested interpretations, you could make up your own."
1,lame,"Did not help me at all. It is a sweet story of one mother's traditions; but, unless you would follow instructions on how to give a tea party that uses a pretty china plate as a symbol of purity to be guarded and kept, it's sweet and pointless."
3,Good for some people,"This book is more targeted for people looking to tone, and loose weight. My goal is to increase lean muscle mass, and this offered little if any information on that. Also Jackowski has some sort of fasination with the jump rope, and i've always thought of it as the most fustrating and boring excersize of all time. But his formula's are pretty accurate, so its not a complete waste of money."
2,Not equal to Nancy Drew,"I wanted to like this book, but the story was a bit far-fetched and in the end didn't hold my attention. The character concept, a girl detective, and the 1930s era in which it was written, made it superficially similar to Nancy Drew, which I hoped it would equal. But Nancy Drew still has the edge."
2,got sent wrong dvd,"I did order a game show dvd,but not this one! It was supposed to have BEAT THE CLOCK,THE MASQUERADE PARTY,THE CELEBRITY GAME,NAME THAT TUNE,and 2 episodes of DO YOU TRUST YOUR WIFE.Instead I received one that had these:IV'E GOT A SECRET,DOLLAR A SECOND,THE 64,000 DOLLAR CHALLENGE,AND WHAT ARE THE ODDS?. Very boring and very bad quality. So I will have to order from another seller."
1,Not what I ordered,"I also received a DVD that didn't have the right episode on it. I thought I had ordered a disk with an episode of ""Truth or Consequences"" on it and instead I got this. I will have to look elsewhere in the future."
5,Update this book and read with LTC Lock's Ranger history,"The previous reviewer is correct about this book---I suggest comparing how foreign armies used bikes successfully along with LTC John Lock's ""To Fight with Intrepidty"" history of the U.S. Army Rangers.Its too bad we don't have yet an updated version of this book in light of the technological advances in mountain bikes which could yield even greater military utility for units that have to be Air-deployed into battle who must be frugal in their weight/volume loading decisions."
1,Weak and cheap.,These scissors have a battery compartment that's very hard to secure. They barely cut through paper and they eat batteries for dinner. They are a cheap inferior product and are not worth the money or the batteries. It states on package as seen on TV. I guess they still sell garbage on TV and sometimes even on Amazon. I think I will return this junk back to Amazon for a refund. Avoid this crummy product. Buyer beware.
4,nice,"its a real nice belly button ring, but the ball part was to small for my girlfriends hole and it wouldnt hold."
3,Misleading,The pictures shows three bowls so I thought I was getting 3 bowls but only received 1. After going back and reading description carefully realized it was only one bowl. It's what I needed but I probably wouldn't of bought it for the price.
1,NOT A LOGITECH KEYBOARD,"I ordered this item to replace my old, and still working, but fairly frimy Memorex keyboard.However this is NOT a Logitech keyboard. It's a black keyboard from Labtech which wasn't very comfortable and tilted downhill, which was annoying."
5,Blue eyed soul lives..,"Without a doubt Daryl's best solo work to date. The smooth jazz apeal througout the entire cd is pleasently balanced with his great soulful vocals. For more Daryl pick up Hall and Oates new one as well, Do It For Love, another great disk by the dynamic duo...Glad to see them still together putting out great music."
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"Daryl Hall rules, plain and simple. I feel he is one of the most underrated singers in America...this CD is such a joy to listen to , the music is phenominal and his smooth, sexy, sultry, voice just makes you want to stop you car in traffic and start dancing in the middle of the street. There's an 80's happy feel this CD which is what I love. Buy his music! For Daryl is still going strong and will always be a beautiful soul in the world of soft rock."
2,A fair book for those wishing to learn the bare minimum,This book is mainly intended for physical educators and those who are interested in Chinese Wushu (martial arts) as an interesting hobby. Little or no real in depth information. The Tai Chi form presented is a modified version of the Yang Long form. The Kung fu forms are rudimentary and resemble Japanese Karate more than Chinese martial arts. Nonetheless this is a good introduction for those who don't want to delve deep into philosophy and are simply seeking an exercise form.
3,What we asked for but the heating element goes fast.,"The items works for a few days then the heating element goes out,Can we get replacements for the Soldering Irons."
4,Great addition,"This battleforce makes a great addition to any army or a great starter, i would how ever recommend some modeling or building experience before you buy this, it can seem a little overwhelming with all the different possible choices for infantry special weapons or making your sentinel armored or not. make sure you know what your building first before you just start snipping and gluing. great price overall. if you bought all this individually it would normally cost you 135$ without shipping."
5,Cornerstone to my excellent birth experience,"I was terrified (of labor) when I became pregnant with my second child. My first experience was excrucitaing and I was not prepared for it. This book was the cornerstone of changing my perspective, and ultimately my experience. I used this book along with Birthing from within, Spiritual Midwifery, Childbirth without Fear, and hypnobirthing classes (in that order). This book helped me overcome my fear. My second experience was completely different, and I believe it was because of the study I had done, and the tools I learned in the Hypnobirthing classes.This book was written over 50 years ago, but it's message is still revolutionary. It is a tad dry, but so worth it. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
3,Not for drawing,This is for photoshop or maybe the GIMP in Linux/Windows gimp.org not for drawing I am afraid.
5,A Good book for Digital Design,"I WAS USING THIS BOOK FOR MY UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES ON ""DIGITAL DESIGN¡, ¡INTEL MIRCROCESSORS, 8086 ASSEMBLER¡, ¡MOTOROLA 16 BIT, 32 BIT AND 64 BIT MICROPROCESSORS¡. THIS BOOK IS VERY USEFUL - IT HAS, FROM ONE HAND A VERY REASONABLE METHODOLOGY BEHIND. FROM THE OTHER HAND IT IS AN EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF DESIGN EXAMPLES. ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IS THE BOOK COVERS ALL THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIGITAL DESIGN. THE NEW EDITION OF THIS BOOK COVER THE HDL, AND THIS BOOK IS BY FAR THE MOST INFORMATIVE AND PRACTICAL. THE NUMBER OF EXAMPLES CONTAINS VERILOG CODE, AND A TEST BENCH. THIS IS THE INCREDIBLE BOOK FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING."
1,". . . or ""Why I Would Prefer to be in the Episcopal Church'","I mistakenly purchased this book after a quick glance in a book store. This is nothing more than a seething rant against Pope John Paul II and the then Cardinal Ratzinger (Wills is borderline rude in his treatment of Cardinal Ratzinger). Wills truly does little to show his love of the Church, which could be inferred from the deceptive title. A sad and disappointing book."
1,Most pathetic excuse for a recipe book ever!,"There is one, count them 1 recipe for bagels and a bunch of ridiculous, anyone could figure out on their own recipes for spreads etc. It wasn't worth 1 dollar, but publishers will publish anything!shame on the writer. I'm sorry I didn't read reviews before buying. I still can't believe it's only one recipe...how do you name it totally BAGELS...Where does the plural come in???"
5,Great printer copier but no driver for Windows 7,"I have owned this printer/copier for over five years and never was disappointed once with it. A little noisy but has worked flawlessly. I installed it on a desktop and then printed from other computers by network through that main computer. My biggest disappointment is that I have gradually replaced the computers in my home with newer ones and, very unfortunately, Windows 7 does not support this printer/copier. There is still one XP connected to the printer but compared with the heavy work it was doing before, I can say it is literally gathering dust where it is now, waiting to be used, and with near-ful toner. I have since purchased Brother MFC 9840, which is color but much slower to print first copy. I am unhappy with Sharp because of lack of continuous support, but the machine itself is great. 5 stars for the machine, 1 for Sharp."
2,don't touch it,"easy fail to work, it did out of order twice within the first 6 months!for the 1st time, the customer service told me I have to pack the machine for return to repair, but they won't provide any boxes and packing material. you know, packing this kind of big heavy thing well is kinda head-ache!for the 2nd time, I was told to input a set of commands to resume the machine to service. well, no problem. But, I don't know why Sharp didn't mention these kind of commands in the instruction book. I'd rather read the instruction book than waiting long for the service HOTline!"
5,very reliable and affordable,"I got frustrated with my 2 radioshack chargers: rs 23-427 (the wallwart version), as they would harldy ever charge my NiMH bats to full capacity.I use the ZTS pulse-load battery tester for this, as el-cheapo capacity indicators suck: they report the voltage, which relation to remaining charge is too subtle to be useful for us.Using the MH-C204F batteries 80-90% of the time get charged to 100%, the remainder to 80% of full capacity. I have had it for 6 months now and it's a gem.Indeed, the undocumented flashing red light seems to indicate a bad battery. On that basis I've tossed about 2 pair of AAA bats of weird brands (like ""TWD"" 700 mAh).I highly recommend this brand and charger!TIP: even though some discourage this, I keep my bats frozen until needed. NiMH self-discharge rate at room temp is rather high. No probs thusfar, and always 80-100% charge."
3,Dissapointment,"Pros: self explanatory(see description). The conquests are very interesting, especially WW II in the pacific.Cons: Not enough conquest scenarios. *World War II scenario in Europe is NOT included in this expansion.* This is unfortunate since it was included as a free conquest option in Civ 2."
2,wrong changes,"All additions and changes to CivIII are useless until they do something about the 2 major shortcomings of the entire Civ series: the stupid movement system (moving each unit individually even when a whole stack wants to go to the same place); and the stupid combat system (where each unit attacks and defends seperately no matter how many are involved in the same battle). Leaders, as defined so far, dont really help much. As it is, I almost never finish a game because it bogs down into endless turns of moving and attacking one unit at a time. Boring!Another major problem is that there are never enough resources, even at the easiest level of play; forcing you into wars, even if you would like to be peaceful. Their availability should be adjustable, the same way the size of continents and other items are.A minor irritation is that I can't choose the color of my units."
1,"I, Claudia","This book is just another poor little rich girl story done to death. There is no character that you feel for except perhaps the parents saddled with the self-indulgent child for whom they can do nothing right. However, the writing is so contrived that all of the characters are flat little cartoons, none worthy of our concern. You learn nothing about Claudia, and eventually are glad of it. When Claudia heads back to London at the end of the book you are sorry for London, but glad that this trite little book is over."
1,Limited usefulness,These are extremely small. You won't find much use for them. I'm disappointed with them. What on earth are they for??
2,"How do you spell ""pig""","Too big, too heavy for something that is supposed to fold away and be at hand for the supermarket run. Probably would work well for moving sacks of concrete or parts of those bodies you've been chopping up to bury in the national park but as a household help? Forget it."
4,Pretty good,The cart was easy to put together. It can hold a lot of things and is pretty convenient. The only downside is that it's a little hard to navigate. The front wheels don't turn.
3,So-so Tommy Emmanuel,"I bought this CD because I heard ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" on Pandora Radio and loved it. To my disappoinment, that was the only track on the CD that I like. I love classical guitar, but this was disappointing."
1,Don't buy this product,"The specs for Pinncale Studio Plus are impresive but despite hours of trying I could never get the software to successfully complete a movie. The program hangs after 5 - 15 min of rendering, regardless of what I am trying to create (DVD, AVI, MPEG, etc.) This is a fatal flaw. The included trouble shooting guide even admints this is a potential problem and basically say to keep reinstalling the program and trying different settings. This should make one nervous. There are any number of other video capture/creating solutions out there to choose from, choose something else."
4,I AM READING IT RIGHT NOW,"I started reading this book awhile ago,and I think that Joan Johnston wasted her talent,the book would be better for me,if the bodyguard was really a stranger instead of the duke.I know that it was written to be romantic but it's not to me."
2,Also disappointed,"You'll find that the author dwells on image format and failed to mention other subjects in detail. Also, instead of really explaining how to combine Photoshop with the other programs, it seems to me that he goes to great length to show why you should run out and buy GoLive and ImageReady. I should have known. I think the author is trying to ""put too much"" into a book and ended up ""teaching little."" Either get a Photoshop tips and trick book or a web design guide. I learned too little from this book for its price, really."
4,Smooth Yule,"Volume I of the GRP Christmas Collection is my favorite, but this Volume II is very good."
5,Great book for ski training!,"This is by far the best book I have ever read regarding getting in shape for the ski season. So many of the books either don't have enough information or get too technical. This was a breeze to read and understand. The author puts otherwise complicated information like understanding lactic acid into an easy to understand format.There were so many exercises to choose from which was great. At the same time the book gave a great step by step program and helped me choose which exercises and activiites were right for me. The illustrations showing which muscles were being worked was an added bonus.If you want to get in the best shape for skiing, buy this book!"
4,Interesting depiction of Heaven and the Universe.,"Codrescu puts together an interesting set of heros and villians, and seems determined to work all religions into the ""Grand Plan"". Very interesting reading, however the gratuitous explicitness especially at the end may put off some readers. The best parts were the depiction of Heaven as a Democratic bureaucracy, and insights into the nature of love, itself."
3,"A little more cerebral stimulation, please!","This is not a bad book if what you're looking for is primarily titilation. But if you want a quality millenium novel with a little more intellectual substance, a more sophisticated plot, and far-greater psychological suspense, tension and drama, I highly recommend THE LAST DAY, by Glenn Kleier--the best of the thirteen millennium novels I've read to date. In fact, one of the most provocative, surprising and exciting stories I've ever read."
3,A story about the year 2000 you might want to skip,"An excellent story idea, the theme is timely, but the excessive sexual content is distracting and offensive."
2,pure bucket chemistry in detergency,"Author without any chemical education wrote a book that must be called ""bucket chemist reference book"". Hundreds of funy statements with many errors. If you are at least at BSc, dont buy the book. I have background in detergents and many statements are funny, non-professiona. many things he calls ""synergistics"" are basic science. If you want to develop business, hire a professional."
5,Great book even for a seasoned pro,"I have about six feet worth of books on chemicals and formulating detergent blends, representing thousands of dollars invested. This book did more to boil down to the nuts and bolts of the blending business than any of those other books. Information that took me years to glean from countless resources was found in Urban's book... in a well organized manner. He even had a few things that I'd never thought about. I was raised in the chemical industry and have owned my own cleaning chemical company for over 20 years. I wish this book had been available back then. While I would have liked to see some ""green"" formulation content, it is still very MUCH a worthy investment."
5,Works like it should,"It's a digital signal, there's no difference between cables. Go for the cheapest out there. Cable worked as promised and resolution went from 480i -> 480p. Images are sharper and colors are better. However, don't expect a huge difference."
3,Well written for the absolute beginner,"I thought this book was very well written and very easy to read, but it is for the absolute beginner. If you know how to use your camera to take photos in differnt lighting situations (you know when to use your flash) then i think you would find that you are abit beyond this book."
5,rada knife,Rada knives are the best paring and peeling knives I have ever owned. I have small hands and they make preparing food easy for me.
2,better alternative,"This is an ok question book, especially since there seem to be few alternatives to studying for the Psychosomatic board exam. However, exactly the same questions can be found on PsychiatryOnline, with an online quiz format. Not only can you practice computerized testing with no flipping about in a book, you get 20 CME credits for your $50."
2,Defective spoon rest,"Everything I own for bakeware is Corelle Abundance. Recently, my spoonrest just up and broke. I don't really feel like shipping it back with that expense, but I am disappointed that what was supposed to be unbreakable broke. My feeling is that I won't be buying another non glassware Corelle product anytime soon."
5,"Great reading, a real page turner","Laura Leone's best book to date. She's found her calling in single title romance. Superb storytelling and use of language. Great comedy, great suspense, great sex, and a great hero - this book has it all. Among the best romances I've ever read!"
4,People don't want to believe.....,"....what contradicts their ""faith"".To all the ""out of context"" reviewers, I suggestthat they listen to Mr Hannegraff's radio programand then they get to hear the self same quotes fromthe book out of the mouths of the charlatans and huckstersthemselves. They truly are a blight on modern Christianityand Mr Hannegraff is to be commended for trying to showtheir supporters just how bad these men really really are.""Experts at removing money from the poor?"". You betcha.""Experts at removing money from the gullible?"". Naturally.The problem is that as timely as this book is, it is next toimpossibe to persuade a ""Word Of Faith"" believer that theyhave been duped.People feel foolish to admit having been fooled. So theydon't believe the evidence of their own eyes and ears."
1,A demonstration of how to get it wrong,"Hannegraaff's work ""seems"" to be throughly researched but there are several instances where he totally misunderstands the true intent of those whom he attacks. Straw man arguments abound and his portrayal of ""Faith Movement"" belief falls short of accuracy in many instances. Another book which deals with this subject but in a much more even-handed way is QUENCHING THE SPIRIT by William De Arteaga. This title is better written and considers events and theology from an historical perspective NOT from a sensational perspective as does Hanegraaff's work. In closing, Hanegraaff's book is a must-have if you want an illustration of how not to write a polemic against your brother or sister in Christ."
4,sarahs review,I found this book to be very emotional. I really enjoyed it! The heorine is strong and the hero magnetic. The plot is well thought out and keeps you interested throughtout the story.
5,one of my favs,I had the cassette for years and played it a lot. Decided to get it on CD so I could play it some more. Great Jazz piano.
3,wish i got a different one,"i thought i didnt want a sling that was stretchy so i got this one bc the fabric doesnt give much, but now that im using it more and more i think i would have preferred a stretchy material one bc it would be easier to get baby in and more comfy for baby. i also tried a small and thought it was too tight so i switched to the medium and it's too loose so im just thinking i would have been happier with another material or sling. the pattern is also really cute but when it came down too it i usually wear it brown side out because i hate if the pattern totally clashes with what i wear. baby and i like the sling concept but looking for another one that works for us."
2,Theory not practicality,Not a bad LDAP overview but I was looking for something more in-depth into the LDAP protocol.
2,Several mistakes.,"At the begining of the book it's quite useful for any beginner but later on the more reading the more discovering of mistake & misunderstand of author. Though author try to explain several terms or concept but as it's not the correct information which I think it's is dangerous part. as potentially leading reader who don't have any backgroud to understand the wrong information / perception. Below is one of them... eg. on Page 368 , The author try to describe the definition of ""SmartCard"" as ID Badges with magnetic strips that contain the actual certifcate.. Which is not right. ""SmartCard"" and ""magnetic strips card"" are impossible to be equivalent in any situations."
1,Don't buy this one!,"Hi, I bought this book in order to understand better LDAP and in order to install OpenLDAB. Well, this book is not enought compared to the free reference at the openLDAP, so forget to buy this one and look another book."
1,Nice Ethics,"Read the first two (oldest) reviews and see how similar the writing styles and commentary are, when compared to the author's (review before this one). All three were written by the same person IMO. Sad... and it might even be a decent book for all I know. But I won't support anyone who spams Amazon's rankings, and I think it's very possible in this case. Easy enough to set up multiple accounts and post things from different ones over time...."
3,Boring and repetitive,"I have to admit I was a little bit disappointed with this book, it feels like the same situation keeps repeating throughout the whole book. The characters don't change or evolved, even after 20 years have passed."
4,Romance and Reality can co-exist,"I found that ""Designed For You"" was a rare blend of romance mixed with the very real problems of this country's downtrodden. The book makes a social statement without being dark and morbid or going ""preacher"" on us.The allegory that the beautiful Lakeview Park makes for all people, regardless of wealth, coincides nicely with the yearning we all feel for finding that special someone who will enhance our lives.Doesn't everyone deserve that? ""Designed For You"" is light, easy reading that will still make the reader think.Cynthia Breeding, author of ""Camelot's Destiny"", due out August, 2006"
2,Usable but not recomendable,"This work by the otherwise reknowned writer, does not come even close to potraying history as it unfolded over the periods treated in this book. Mr. quigley never looks at the periods before 6000 bc. as oceanic cultures but assumes that all there is, is inland movement. What a shame. Further, the first 100 pages or so are one big camel to swallow for anyone who is familiar with the philosophy of plato and aristotle and his equating of the two, pains me more than a little. Everybody should know that plato was a sublime excercise in dialectics and aristotle a categorical denounciation of the brilliant plato.You could have some benefit from this, but you need a very thorough understanding of the hostory of ideas and of Lyndon LaRouches perspective of economics, to not be misguided.Borrow in library, don't buy"
5,Quality,I have been using Porter Cable biscuits for years. These biscuits along with my Lamello Jointer are much better. The size of the biscuits are very consistant so all the biscuits fit in all the slots.
4,A good precursor for those interested in diseases and plagues,"""Man and Microbes"" is an excellent precursor for those interested in studying numerous diseases and plagues that have affected humans over time - and how these illnesses subsequently initiated change in many aspects of life in rural areas, cities, travel and more. Yes, more could have been written on each type of disease/plague; however, that was not the reason for the book. There are books that go into great depth on smallpox, TB, Ebola, etc. that can be studied if one desires, but this book is meant to be a starting place in developing the knowledge of our past dealings with diseases. This book covers in some detail as to how humans have adapted and understand vectors and other factors in order to prevent or limit life-threatening diseases. I strongly recommend this book for everyone, particularly as we try to survive in a world filled with both old and new microbes that can easily change our daily lives."
2,A True Doll Book,"This book provided lots and lots of detail on making dolls, all kinds of dolls so whoever reads this, its a great buy for a young child looking for a hobby. The detail on constructing different types of dolls is useful and invaluable insight and I wish someone has bought me this when I was a lot younger."
5,Wish I Had Been There,"This would have been an amazing concert to attend. For any Rippingtons fan this is a must-get album. I have always enjoyed guitar improvisation and this album makes Russ one of my heroes. He plays with a lot of control and energy on every song. One thing that makes this album unique is his emphasis on the electric guitar. On several songs I was completely surprised by his solos. They seemed to come out of nowhere and yet they worked well. ""Weekend in Monoco"" and ""Tourist is Paradise"" were my favorites. Don't think twice about buying this album."
2,Very poor service/equipment from Badminton Warehouse,"I was looking for a good badminton set for the whole family. I did not buy this product from Amazon, but directly from the dealer. Though the equipment came quickly, it is of very poor materials. The frame fro the net is very cheap plastic and can easily come down. The net was no better than one you can get through a much cheaper set. When we tried to contact the dealer by both email and phone, we have gotten no response. Through this dealer, you also can not get a refund, only replacement, or so says their policies, since they will not contact us back."
4,kitten food,My kitten likes it better then Whiskas.I feed her 1 day soft 1 day hard.It is fair priced for real meat to be the 1st ingredients.
1,not dolce and gabbana,"I was about to purchase this item even though the shipping is more expensive than the actual product, but the i went to their website and as it turns out, this isn't even a Dolce and Gabbana brand. such a disappointment"
3,still smells --like paint or other chemical --,cart is large and convenient ---but it came with a STRONG odor---cloth liner I put in garage because I could not stand the smell---the cart still has the smell --but is gradually lessening --but I have had it together for at least 2 or more weeks.
5,I would rate this cart if it was the one I received.,"I'm kind of in a quandry about this cart. I ordered this cart, in blue and when the package came it was not this cart, however, it was a beautiful blue. So if you will go to the swivel wheel cart that I got, I'll tell you what I think of it. I gave it five stars because I have the same one in red, but a part fell off and I can't find it, so I had to order a new cart. The part that fell off is a silver cap and I don't even know where to start to look for one. I loved the red one until the cap on a cross bar fell off, so when I push it along, the rod falls out and rubs on the wheel making it impossible to roll. Maybe I should have taken off a star for that."
3,It ain't what it used to be!,I have had Foley mills in the past and was very happy with the quality of the product as well as with the way it works. It was disappointing to find the mill much smaller than my previous ones and the mechanism for forcing the food through the holes does not work as good as on others that I have used. I would have been willing to pay more money to get a mill of better quality rather than this smaller one that does not puree as well and doesn't do a proper job on the 'cleaning sweep'. The manufacturer needs to rethink their design or just go back to the old style because it really did work!
5,Food Mill,I purchased this mill after seeing it at my friend's home. My most important reason for wanting the mill is to make applesauce. It functions beautifully. I've not used it for other purposes as yet.
1,Not What I Had Hoped For,First no instructions ... you can't even find something by looking up the manufacturer online ... hence I have no idea if the thing is broken or I'm just not using it correctly ... anyhow it has been a big disappointment.
1,juicer at best,"I bought this to make applesauce and tomato sauce, but when I used it I got mostly water. It was terrible. Nothing like the description or the reviews.On top of that, it was not very comfortable to use."
1,Really!,"So I ordered these thinking they would look good in the graveyard I was setting up for my halloween party. When I got the package I could hold all of them in my one hand. I guess that could be my fault since I didn't notice they were not the size I was expecting. Then when I was opening it I noticed it had a price on the package of $10, but I was charged like $14. That made me really angry. I won't be purchasing from this company again. Side note to the company_if you are going to overcharge for a product, make sure you take the lower product off the package or cover it up. Thats covered in Business Mgmt 101...get a clue!"
1,Overpriced and undersized,"Two reasons for the one star review:1. A sticker on the actual product package said suggested retail is $10. We paid $13.78 for this product through Amazon. I expect to pay less than or equal to suggested retail online.2. These tombstones fit in the palm of my hand. Yes, yes, if you read the fine print, this is described in the product description as I look in hindsight but it is deceptive and unsatisfactory."
3,"Ok, not Perfect","These ""Guardz"" seem to perform the task I bought them for: protecting the screen of our Garmin C330 from scratches (particularly my wife's fingernails). However, they do produce increased reflections in sunlight and make the screen slightly harder to read."
1,Day light robbery,"This edition is barely different from the 1999 edition, but the price difference is vast. I would not pay more than $4 for the very elementary and common sense information presented in the book. I recommend buying a used copy of the old ( ie 1999 ) edition which is available for less than $5. The authors of the book really ought to be ashamed of themselves for pricing the book so ridiculously high"
4,Does its job!,"I bought this paper because 1.) I needed some resume paper and 2.) I was buying a birthday present for my husband and I didn't want a smaller box to come to the house for fear he might know what his present was. :) As it is, I find this paper great for resumes and other important documents. My only problem is that I should have bought the matching envelopes."
5,"A man, his demons, and the woman who save him","On air, Danny seems to be an open book; those who believe that they've heard Danny's stories or those who generally shun the celebrity ""tell all"", will be blown out of their seats by this book. The most shocking aspect of ""Random Acts of Badness"" is that his expected sharp wit and humor is intertwined with truly poignant moments. Thanks to Bonaduce's comic timing, this reader was in tears through the whole book, caused, one moment, by the sadness of a life almost wasted and the next because of a hilarious one liner, usually at the expense of the author. This is NOT another in an endless parade of celebrity tell alls this is the true story about a man, his demons, and the woman who saved him."
2,Brush bear,I would not call this a plush bear but a brush bear. Its fur is more like a brush and not a soft one. It does not look like any bear I have ever seen.
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with the book and CD. Not really helpful in learning the Dobro and you have to order another product (tabular sheets) to have everything you need. I feel like I threw my money away.
5,WOW,These speakers will blow your mind as soon as you hear themThere very very strong & they seem 2 have a sound of there own.
1,Shakey shaky,"These things suck. So out of true. They may be cheaper, but there is a good chance you be having them turned to get them true. Buy Raybestos and be done with them."
1,I wish I wouldn't have bought this one,"I bought this book after reading several great reviews. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed. I do not like the stories at all. Not to mention, they are long and the pictures are almost non-existant. It's just not my kind of book.My boys did not enjoy it either. They are 2.5 and almost 3.5 years old and love to be read to. They're not picky, but they really dislike this one. I've tried to read it to them several times (despite my not liking it) and they are running to the bookshelf to get different books the second they see it.It ""might"" be a good choice for older children (I would say no younger than 8 years), but definitely not for younger ones."
2,Dead Mouse,This mouse worked superbly for 18 month and has died. The USB port no longer recognized the device.
3,Works great for a while,"This mouse was a good solution at the time when i bought it, after using my macbooks touch pad for the longest time. I'm rating this 3 stars because at the moment it is having trouble selecting things with just one click. It wont register on the first click, and it has gone up to 4 clicks without registering.... the tracking is fine however. The distance is not anything to boast about either. I do like the slim usb dongle, but it is time to upgrade. Im going to try to Apple Bluetooth mouse next and see how it performs in comparison.***EDIT***Don't get me wrong, i replaced the battery once, and the mouse started to act that way. Changed the battery again and the left click now works fine. For now. Not sure what was going on before, possibly a bad battery right out of the pack."
2,Works OK but annoying issues,"Kind of small, but feels good in my hand, almost like a bigger mouse, comfortable to use.Pros:Feels nice, responsive.Button clicks crisp, not mushy or ambiguous.Cons:Poor receiver sensitivity, loses signal about 15"" away, must stay within 12"" for reliable use.Buttons make loud clicks.Driver software does not allow programming any button to be ""double click"". There are a dozen useless actions that can be assigned to a button, but not double-click. This is a deal breaker for me."
2,"Not terribly authentic, a dissapointment","I own and love my Mexico the Beautiful Cookbook, so I decided to invest, and at 50 dollars it IS an investment, in the Italian edition. I was severely dissapointed in it. The photography is indeed as beautiful as the Mexico book, but the recipes are rather blah. I greatly prefer my books by Marcella Hazzan, especially her Essentials of Classical Italian Cooking.After using Hazzan's books, this one left me cold. I gave it away, and that is rare, as I collect cookbooks. Save your money."
1,A Big Gyp,This cart is supposed to have steel wheels and hold 250 pounds. The wheels sure looked like plastic when they broke under a load of just over 100 pounds! Not good!
3,"Does the job well enough, but not great","The cart is sturdy and does a decent job. It collapses nicely into a pretty thin state for easy out-of-the-way storageMy only issues are that the front wheels do not rotate, so it only goes in a straight line when pushed with all four wheels on the ground. You have to tilt it back onto just the rear wheels to turn it, which can be really annoying. Also, putting the rear wheels on was a serious pain. There's little holes that you have to blindly get pins through. It's mostly luck when they finally get through the hole properly, so you just have to keep at it until it works (took me forever to get the last wheel on).Apart from that, it still does it's job (just not incredibly well), so I'm satisfied."
3,Help! Came with no instructions!!,"It looks like a great cart but just opened the box and there's no instructions. I bought it months and months ago (got lost in a move). Can't find anything on web, even who to call. Amazon no help. Can you be? I look forward to someday using this cart! Thanks for any help you can give me. @EllisGBS PS sorry I had to pick ""stars"" else Amazon wouldn't publish my plea for help."
3,A good cart,"This is the third Super shopping cart I purchased,I gave them as gifts and everyone is surprised that in can hold a lot of stuff and it can hold up to 250lbs."
1,Silly:Good; Stupid: Bad!,"Like Moo/Baa/Laa this is another book that attempts to be silly but ends up being stupid!The books messes it up in the very beginning.. ""Aardvark Admiring"". That is just plain stupid!If you want silly; try ""four fluffy feathers on a fiffer-feffer-fef""Sandra is no Dr. Seuss for sure!Even my 14 month old thinks this book is lame! If I start reading this; she brings me the Dr. Seuss ABC.I found one good use of this book! It makes an excellent table leveler"
2,Cute until you get to letter U,"My children (ages 2 and 1) absolutely adore Boynton books, such as ""Snuggle Puppy"" and ""The Going to Bed Book"". They like this one as well, however, I have a real problem with ""uglybirds being ugly"" representing the letter U."
3,"If you've seen the movie, do you really need to read this?","No.Granted, there are differences in the stories. (Mild differences.) And, the book is better than the movie. (Mildly better.) But, if you've seen the film you are bound to find yourself asking, 'Why am I reading this?'Ultimately, Hellblazer is a horror story: The excitement in reading the work is the subversion of normal expectations (real world setting... but, with daemons and magic), the creation of tension (cancer, a life of regrets... but, with daemons and magic), and, most particularly, with the reveal / resolution of the tension.In any Hellblazer tale the normal world goes sideways, bad things happen, and, impossibly, Constantine makes it out alive. And that makes for good reading. As long as you don't already know the reveal. Which, if you've seen the movie, you do.So this isn't so much a negative review as it is a warning that if you've seen the film you are better off buying a different issue of Hellblazer."
4,Great light for tight space,"This light is small, durable, and fit just where I wanted it. It does not through a ton of light so don't expect to get the same light you would from a 100 watt bulb. I like the fact that the actual light housing is metal. It would have been nice if the clip was also metal and we shall see how long that lasts."
5,Andy Williams,I had seen this on PBS and really loved it. Nobody sounds like himhe will be missed. Great DVD m
3,NOT FOR AVERAGE SIZE WRIST,I just rec'd this item. It was packaged nicely and the watch is very pretty. I am a bit disappointed in the size of the band and if I decide to keep I now have the added expense of having a link or two removed. If this is supposed to be an oversized bangle it should be mentioned in the description. I am rating this 3 stars only because of the extra large band.
3,Intrigue and Incest,"The story kept me enthralled but confused. I could not put the book down since I wanted to find out who killed Honoria. I finally found out but was never really certain why the revealed murderer killed Honoria. I had to keep turning back to the front of the book to keep the family lines straight - it was all very confusing. I still like the book since it kept me guessing until the end. However, I am still scratching my head since the plot was not really cleaned up for me at the end and the ending was not very realistic. I am still grappling with why Tommy was sent by the foreign secretary to be involved in the entire mess. In fact I still do not understand the link to the French, to Mr. Fraser and to the Marquise. That is why I am only giving it a three - the plot is not neatly tied up at the end."
2,Absurd,"I really wanted to like this book, and I did enjoy the first 250 pages. After that, the book's plot collapses into a confusing, gothic, absurd mess. It's really bad writing when - at the end of the book - the author has to have a character summarize/speculate the motives/reasons/etc. behind the murders. And even then, you'll probably be asking yourself, ""what?!""SPOILERS AHEAD - I can't even begin to count how many characters found out that who they thought were their parent(s) really weren't. They should have provided a chart at the end so a reader could understand how everyone was REALLY related to one another. And, the main plot of the book is to find out who murdered Honoria. Oh, you learn the man's alias, but you don't really know who he is and the ""why"" is a bit sketchy."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"After reading Daughter of the Game, I was excited to read this book. But, is was a tremendous letdown. There was no real plot. Not much suspense. The last half of the book is an annoying speculation of incest and adultery. Don't bother with this one!"
2,What didn't you like?,"I wasn't thrilled with the color. I was looking for something more ""natural"" color"". They will, however, do just fine."
3,It is a very impressive book!,The book is easy to read but I was thrilled by the story. You can feel with the different persons and you can imagine their feelings. During the whole book the tension is always there. I think the subject (pregnancy and abortion) is very important today and this book tells open about the difficulties when a teenager becomes a baby. You can see how difficult it is to stand her own feelings at the tender age of sixteen. The book shows that life could be very hard and painful for example when you have to educate the baby on your own opinion or that you have difficulties to get a job or to finish the school. The boys have also to be concerned on this subject. Girls and Boys have to think what they do. I think the writer will this bring up to the people. Helen (the main person) felt finally lucky about Amy her little daughter. Mirjam Wenzinger
4,A special book,"The book is written from two sites. It describes the way Helen feels in her letters to ""nobody"" which is in fact her unborn baby, and it shows the different sights of the persons in the difficult situations. The story doesn't really surprise you, when you start to read, you can already see the end, in a way it even starts with the end... The actions of the people are realistic and you understand them all. And it motivates you to think more about the problematic, ""What would I do"", ""How would I react"" and ""Would I make an abortion"". When you've finished the book, you don't really know if it has a happy end or not, which I think is positive. There are enough books with happy end's and bad end's... but the end in this book ""Dear Nobody"" is more real then many other. After all a really great book! R.S."
4,Beyond Chaos,"Buy this book if you lift weights or as a gift for anyone you know who lifts.McRobert's editorial organization is nonexistent; the topic sequencing is chaos theory in action. But the concepts are golden, and they are clearly detailed. The hours spent reading Beyond Brawn will save the reader years of wasted time and prevent many hardships.Now, if he would just get organized ;-)Marty Bacon"
1,Didn't work for me,"I got into Hardgainer style training before i had tried other training methods. Unfortunately twice a week training with little or no aerobics and a heavy diet is going to make anyone genetically typical fat. I ended up looking worse than when i began - no muscle growth but a lot of fat.I recently began training every other day for longer periods on more exercises, using aerobics every day, quit drinking milk and have never looked better in my life. For those of you who are genetically superior twice a week training will be enough - for the rest of us to avoid getting fat i suggest more regular training."
2,Too Repetitive -,"I want to start by saying that there is definitely a lot of good information in this text, and the author clearly has a wealth of knowledge on the subject.My issue is that it could have been cut by about 75% and contained that great knowledge. I got pretty tired if reading about ""how it PEDs and genetics play such a huge role in physique- but you can still build a great one without them."" it isn't that I disagree with the statement, I just only needed to read it once. And it felt like this went on for most of the book with good information just kind of sprinkled around it."
4,A Gold Mine But You've Gotta Dig,At last a book which tells it like it is. Stuart does an expose on the glittering world of steroid induced elites and slick marketing gurus who promise you too can be like them. Read this book and you will discover a realistic and sound approach amid all of the hype and nonsense around today.I am reluctant to criticise this book but I feel that it needs to be restructured in a more user friendly way with a clearer layout easier on the reader's eye. The book is disjointed and reads more like a legal document than a book. Finding or reviewing important information is an arduous affair and sometimes sections are long winded and don't get to the point quick enough. The information contained in this book is golden but needs some serious presentation work to polish it off.
4,Fast paced ending,Well written. Excellent combination of facts & fiction with just the right amount of both. Leaves you wanting more...and it looks like more is available!
1,So badly formatted it is hard to read. Book is ruined.,Good fun book ruined by mad extra hyphenation on every page.Ar-ea 51 The Rep-ly. No I am not joking!This is a Total insult to Kindle readers.Does anyone EVER check the e-transfers?Amazed that the author has not fixed this.4 stars for the novel1star for the appalling formatting
4,Good story,I liked the book. Fun to to read and it was hard to put down. Can not wait to the next book to come out!
5,"Good sequel, but doesn't close the door","This book got pretty wild with some of the action-- I'm more interested in the connections to ancient artifacts and man's history that the author covers. Hope the next book answers some more questions in that area. Definitely need to read this series in order or it could be confusing. This is less 'factual' than some other books on the market about Area 51, but more entertaining. Might want to look at Darlington's book if you want the 'real' state of things at Area 51 right now."
4,great series anxiously awating Area 51:The Mission,"From the first page of this series to the last, this has been a great story. The factual information in this fiction just makes it that much harder to actually believe it is fiction. With only a passing interest in UFO and science fiction reading materials, I'm hooked on this series. I can hardly wait for the Misson....."
2,I think the author owes it to their reader,"to give them a better ending than ""To Be Continued"".The science is (very) shakey. The drama a bit too cliche. Entertaining reading none the less, provided expectations are set correctly.But the ending, please, something better than ""Go Buy My Next Book""?"
2,Buddha Boring,"I purchased this book to read with my 13 year old students and while it started out OK, nothing happened to keep their (or my) interest."
3,A good summer reading book,"The novel buddha boy by Kathe Koja is about Justin the main character, who struggles through peer pressure and the social order at Edward Rucher High School located in Northfield. For his luck he meets a boy name Jinsen(Michael Martin)who is at the bottom of the social status. He tries to avoid him to keep his reputation. He notices that Jinsen has extra ordinary art skills and is very unique. He would get involved in different situations that would make him make decisions that would affect their friendship. At the end he'd done the right thing but he knows he is loosing a great friend.When reading the book, you might be able to related to justins feelings and how peer pressure makes you take the wrong decisions. Also I personally think the ending wasn't as good as what it could've been."
5,Perfect Envelopes for half-fold cards,I make a lot of my own cards on the computer. These envelopes fit the cards perfectly - not too tight or too loose. They are good quality. I would highly recommend them!
4,early introduction to American history,"This early reader features Sam, a boy who joins his father as a Minuteman, and takes place in Concord and Lexington on the day the American Revolution begins. At 62 pages, with simple vocabulary, this book does a nice job of capturing the uncertainty and excitement of these events for a young person, and would be a good selection for a young reader interested in history. The companion volume by the same author, 'George the Drummer Boy', tells the story of a boy on the side of the loyalists on the same day. Simple but nice illustrations."
3,not what I thought,"I like some of Ramsey Lewis but this wasn't my favoite. I love hisMother Nature cd, but it's far to expensive."
3,Database Design,I am a little surprised by how well this book is rated by other readers. I have undertaken a lot of study of databases throughout the course of my computer science degree and was after a book that could help me transform my knowledge of the theoretical into a working practical knowledge centred around Access. There is no doubt that the book is very thourough but I find it difficult to really get useful information from it quickly; which is what I had expected from a reference book. I had hoped that my need to learn Access implementation fast would be catered for by this book but I have been unable to make much use of it for anything more than snippets of information. My feeling is that if you are after something that will tell you how to create useful Applications with Access then you'd be better making sure that this book does it before you purchase. Good Luck
2,"Covers a lot, but ""complete""? No.","When I bought this book, I thought this would have everything I would need. Wrong. The book is good for taking the exam, because it covers everything in just enough detail. However, if you want to do a lot of advanced operations like using cross-tab queries, Visual Basic, dynamic reports, etc, etc.. the book pretty much leaves you out in the cold.Don't get me wrong: the book is great if all you want is a good overview of everything inside Access, but the title ""Complete Reference"" is totally misleading....just my two cents..."
4,Dead at Day Break,Living in Cape Town i just love reading Deon Meyer's books . It just brings the whole story close to home . He has so far not failed to hold my attention .
3,Modern South African Thriller,A great thriller set in modern day South Africa. Both the criminal aspects and the characterizations of the country are true to life. This is what makes Meyer a fantastic writer!
5,An ingenious account,An ingenious account of a book that is anti-psychiatry by an American Professor who is a psychiatrist. This book is an educational tool for the British Mental Health Movement.
3,a little overrated for the high price you pay,"This is a very expensive way to put glue in a biscuit hole. It works fairly well, and saves some mess, but doing it carefully by hand should be considered."
4,A Gentle Story,"Ciro Valentino was ready to start her new life in America with her family when due to a mistake, she is turned away at Ellis Island and forced to return to Europe.While trying to find her best friend, Lucia, she runs into trouble and is rescued by Thatcher Montgomery, an American who is traveling in Europe. She finds Lucia but then when she and Lucia are ready to go to America, Thatcher rescues her again. Lucia has a steerage ticket but Ciro has no money and is going to go as a stowaway. Thatcher finds out and pays for a first class ticket for her.Ciro, Lucia and Thatcher travel on the same ship to New York. Thatcher and Ciro fall in love but he is forced by family obligations to deny it to himself. Then Ciro finds her life taking a totally new direction and she too has to deny her true feelings.This is a gentle story for a quiet day while two lovers find their way to each other."
1,Disappointing - front wheel not straight and handle bars do not stay in place,Bought this for Christmas and although it did assemble easily and looked great my daughter was able to turn the handle bars and get them out of alignment. I tried several times to tighten the handle bars but no matter what I did it is always easy to turn the handle bars and they will slip out of place. Also the front wheel was out of alignment and not perpendicular with the ground (another review mentioned the same thing so apparently it is not just the one I bought). Very disappointing and I will be returning it.
3,Retro Look BUT New Construction,Pros1. Real retro feel2. All metal3. Classic stylingCons1. Some parts are pretty cheap2. Hard to keep handlebars tight3. Hard to keep adjustable seat at right height4. Pretty strong rubber odor (re tires)
5,This is a great deal,The last time I purchase an invitation envelope A2; it was at an office supply store and their own private brand--I shopped several stores and one can expect to pay between $11.00 and $14.00 for 100 envelopes. This is a wonderful bargain--and the brand is well known. This is the right size for quarter fold greeting cards made on your computer. I use office publisher 2010; however so many other programs allow you to print quarter-fold greeting cards and envelopes. If you have an HP printer--I never had an HP that would not handle the printing of these envelopes--go for it.
5,Great quality with a great price.,I was looking for envelopes for my gift card sets I was making and I found these. The paper is very solid but soft. They seal and stay sealed. I was really happy with my purchase and I'll be saving these to my favorites to purchase again!
4,Wonderful but,"I very much enjoyed Angela Hewitt's playing in Bach's keyboard concertos. Some might quibble that they are played on a piano, but horses and carts have also been replaced by motor cars. The ACO is one of Australia's treasures - described in London as the world's best chamber orchestra - and it gives Hewitt wonderful support. (The prolific reviewer Larry VanDeSande has eleswhere described the ACO as ""a scrawny sounding period band"" but LVDS seems to have sacrificed integrity for effect - he might equally describe the Chicago orchestra as ""overblown and conventional""). The real problem with Hewitt and the ACO is that equally fine performances at a fraction of the cost can be found on Naxos with Hae-won Chang (piano) and the Camerata Cassovia. Fair dinkum and I kid you not."
3,still searching,"hey!!i hope you are well.listen i got this product b/c i wanted to reduce my stomach size.now, i did see a reduction. but it wasnt as dramatic as i thought it would be.the product arrived fresh and on time.i would not get this product again, but i would buy from this seller."
1,How about ships at a randomly determined time - Don't bother,"I ordered this product a month ago. It is supposed to ship in 1-2 weeks..... False claim. Don't bother. I just checked the status of my order 3 weeks later and it is estimated to ship in another month with delivery another 2 weeks after that.... By my count that means the product ships in 8 weeks with delivery in 10 weeks. Sure, that's fine, I didn't plan on using my cell phone until then anyway. This is a pointless exercise."
5,great book,"an awesome book on how to get the most out of intimacy with your partner. Helps take it up a notch! Read it to your man so he knows exactly how to please you, hey if he understands it you'll like him more."
1,Not recommended,"This book is actually just a very long advertisement for other books written by Steve Bodansky about orgasm. I bought this book at the same time asWhat Women Want Men to Know, and De Angelis' book contains more useful information - at least to me."
4,Jumping problems no more,This is a great book for getting ideas on grid work use for solving jumping problems. Have used it quite a bit already. It will be in my riding library for a long time.
5,Narratives that make you think,"These encounters are written in the first person which I initially found a little daunting. In reality, they opened hearts and minds to in-depth discussions that were truly meaningful and spiritually nurturing. A terrific resource that is probably underutilized. My advice: don't be afraid to use it!"
3,Disappointed,"Only a couple of cuts on this CD really grooved me. The merging of jazz and Latin is my cup of tea (or substitute a beverage of your own), but I was disappointed in this, especially after seeing the 5-star reviews. I was suspicious from the beginning, with the sappy elevator-music first cut. And, in a rreal jazz band, more than the leader, or one person solos. Here, more than one solo[d, but not enough. Too arranged. I kept wanting to hear an instrumental voice break out from the assembled mass, but rarely did. Maybe Sandoval should have let someone else produce this--it seems too self-centered, including all the old-fashioned posed photos of him in the small brochure included with the CD. Oh, the percussion was tops sthroughout--but even then, more solos!"
2,Really not...good.,"I picked this up at the bookstore I work at and read it on my break one afternoon. Having been delighted in the past by Raymond, I expected a lot more from him. This truly was one of the worst children's books I've read. The Borders I work at is huge, filled with talented artists and writers whose children's picture books will continue to go unnoticed. However, a celebrity can write anything and get full recognition for it. This book plays out merely as a remembrance of a day he took at a family outing. No redeeming quality or sense of entertainment to keep a child's interest in here. Just randomness of a charicature of his childhood that had potential of being interesting, yet fell very short of being just that. Stick with Sendak, Rey, Yolen, or Eric Carle if you want something that will peak interest."
3,A lot of cologne for the money,"This is a lot of cologne for the price. 8 oz. is a huge bottle! Fragrance is very nice and while it does smell like the Pierre Cardin my husband wore in the 80s, it wears off quickly and the cap seems to be missing the classic PC emblem for Pierre Cardin. I would not want to make an accusation of a knock-off because I don't know, but it is a great fragrance and well worth the price. I would probably buy again based on value."
2,"Personally, I shouldn't have bothered","I found this book to be very limited and incomplete. Of the dozen or so items I looked up, it had listed two. Even such catagories as well documented as Royal Doulton were incomplete, leaving me guessing as to the value of my pieces. I really wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
1,PC DOS 2000 CD-ROM,"According to the installation instructions in the User's Guide you must have a copy of DOS 3.3 or higher (THUS THIS IS AN UPGRADE). But, there is no indication in Amazon's advertisement or on the cover of the User's Guide that this is an upgrade. The first mention that it is an upgrade is on page xii of the User's Guide.So if you don't already have a version of DOS, DON'T buy the CD-ROM."
1,WHY?,"I just got this book, and usually it takes me about two days to read a book. It is day 5. I have read a number of books by this author and each time I am disappointed.(you think I would learn my lesson) I picked up this book because it featured a full fiqured woman, and a nice seeming man. However, the story is boring and extremely long. They hardly paid any attention to Tara in the beginning of the book, and the kisses that were hot often fizzled into no where. There was typos all over the place. I wish Velma would get a backbone and for the her personality you would think she would not care that she is a bigger woman. Lastly, My theory is if a man don't love and respect his mother, he won't respect you. Just not worth the time, long and boring."
1,Disappointed,"When I read the preview of the book and discovered the female lead character was a full-figured woman I bought the book instantly, since I am a full figured woman also. This book was simply unrealistic, boring, and just all around not good."
1,I'm sorry I didn't listen to the negative reviews,"My initial thought is that the characters conversation seems stiff or mechanical. Even their thoughts seem to lack a certain flow. It's just WEIRD.An example was the first chapter; the author didn't allow you the opportunity to get to know the characters. (Granted I know it's a romance novel however if you can descriptive details about the home, the kid, the brothers etc, then you should be able to cut back on those descriptive details and give me more character development so that I can relate.) I was thoroughly confused with who's who and what's what. It was like a continuation of the first book however if you didn't read the prior book, you're going to be lost. In fairness, maybe my Kindle edition was missing a few paragraphs/sentences and that's why I didn't get a proper introduction to the characters. Yeah (Insert my sarcasm).Nonetheless, I like the premise of the book I just didn't like the execution."
1,Don't buy,Movies are cut short. No endings. There is no way all of these movies can be on the disks. Couldn't see the end of them. Waste.
5,Let your social conscience be a guide,"Spike Lee objected to his father marrying someone because she was white.No matter how good the films were, there are many of you who would never purchase products by a white director if he or she objected to their father marrying someone because she was black.Let your social conscience be a guide and not be hypocritical in purchasing this if you would not purchase by a such white director.I.e. don't be like many boondocks readers"
4,You really get ur money's worth,"I really like this collection, even though I thought it should have included his first work, school daze, instead of Clockers, u get five dvd's for the price of 1."
3,good but can't organize your files,"We got this for a real good deal, and it plays well. The only thing that is not so good is you can't organize your songs/files, your songs are listed in alphabetical order. I tried to put an audiobook on it, but it got all out of order, I guess the titles need to be alphabetized, which is not convenient. So you can't put an audiobook on it in order very easily. I like the Sandisk mp3 player I got better than the Nextar."
2,Buyer Beware,"The ""idea"" behind this product is a good one. I like the fact it's on the smaller side, and can be ""hidden"" in the wall; however, the very first shot that my 7 y/o took, the rim collapsed, and the net broke in 2 places! Very discouraging after taking the time to hang up on the wall. Not to metion, that my husband had to drill 2 holes in the metal bracket because there were none drilled for us! Anyway, we took it down, and sent it back, in hopes to get a different one that is better quality!"
3,A theological discussion,"This book provides a theologian with a nice summary and dialogue of 22 concepts related to religious inquiry. The various authors draw on Tillich, Hegel, Heidegger, Kant any many other scholars to provide a format or review of the term being discussed. This is not a book meant for a lay person or beginning college student. A graduate theological student may find it appealing as an aid for her/his own research. As a college religion instructor, I had hoped this book would be a helpful tool for my students. It is too advanced."
2,Hard-Wired,A typical mainstream-jazz/fusion effort. Focused more on compositions than improvisation. The musicianship is on a quite high level and Weckl’s drumming is as always very intricate and melodious. However the sound of synths and the choice of most melodies makes this album very cheesy sounding. Therefore it is almost unlistenable for me. If you like easy listening fusion it may appeal to you but I strongly recommend you the more mature Transition instead of this one.
5,Absolutley captivating of your heart,"I,ve yet to see a video about any type of animal life outside of the human race that could capture my attention and my heart the way this one did.In so many cases you feel the joy,the sadness and sometimes the silliness the chimps endure in the lives that they live.You're made to feel that you could bring one of them into your home and have no language or lifestyle barrier between you.If you ever need convincing that we are all alike in one way or another-animal or human-this is the movie to see."
5,wonderful!,This book is one of the first science-fiction novels I ever read. I really enjoyed the characters and the story was very involving.
3,Good,This product is good as a toy only.It is a cute soft little doll with big eyes and long hair. It does not have much to do with the educational value except that little girls can cuddle and pamper the doll pretending like a baby. Durability is of okay type nothing great. My girl wanted to take off her shoes:) but could not because its sewn. The dress and other accessories are not detachable.
2,"Fine concept, terrible transcription","In December, 1968 Ballantine Books released the first printing of Omnivore. In the decades since, the novel has remained a cleverly written and innovative ecological adventure story peopled with interesting characters.However, this is a massively inferior transcription to ebook format. Much of the punctuation, present in the original editions, has been dropped entirely. Paragraphing and dialogue exchange, clearly expressed in prior editons, are reduced to confusing run-on blocks. Rather than an being an enjoyable text, the reader is forced to pause to decipher conversations.This novel deserved a much better transfer to electronic format. It is suggested that the reader await a better edition."
3,Good but disappointing,"As always, the author/illustrator's work is great. Read the description and the other reviews. Just one thing. I was under the impression that the book was mostly about ice age or prehistoric Europe. In fact, that is only the last part of the book. The first 2/3 or more is about the land around the author in more recent times. That was a little disappointing. Also, the illustrations while very good are not on the same level as his other work--very little light and color compared to most of his painting. It's like he was depressed when he was painting this book. Anyhow, there is nothing else like this out there, and it is very adequate. Just know that it is ""Journey to the Ice Age,"" not ""the Ice Age."""
1,Editor's Discription Is Misleading,"I recently ordered this book to find out it focuses on ""agressive, sexual and blasphemous"" obsessions; other obsessions are neglected. People considering ordering this book should be aware of the book's limitations."
4,Excellent Dvd Portable With an excellent screen and reasonable sound for the price.,"I bought two of these units refurbished from a major retailer,at christmas time.The picture is excellent and the sound good for a portable.Now when you buy used or refurbed,you are rolling the dice as to wheather you will get a good unit.My units turned out to be multiregion and multizone,which means it plays every disc from around the world.I cant promise you these results,but that the unit will play region 1 only.This unit is the amw 510.This model and the amw520 may still be available on ebay.Good Luck and please make sure the retailer has a good refund policy of at least 30 days.Thank you from Stewart L 02/22/07"
4,"Indepth, precise and complex","This book is a must have for those interested in all things Jewish, Mathematical and Astronomical. It is a complete reference piece that really clarifies and co-ordinates vast fields that are spread throughout the literature in a concise easy to read format in a single english volume.Some of its style is a little out of vogue, but will nevertheless still satisfy the thirsty for a truly remarkable expression of rabbinics in this under-studied field."
4,Rock and Roll bluesy Coo,"Gave this cd 4 stars only because I don't like All the songs. I am a guitarist and I love Carltons phrasing and creativity. If you are used to Carltons ""Sweet"" stuff, this will definitely be a departure for you. Don't let that stop you from buying the CD however, as this is the other side of Larry Carlton one that you may remember from the days of the Crusaders!!! I listen to this Cd at least 2-3 times a week I like it that much. Larrys collaboration with with Terry McMillan is a perfect match on those bluesy cuts. And of course anything Rosen and Grusin produce is usually gold. Enjoy"
2,Could be so much better,"I was excited to find this product and ordered two different Spanish card sets at the same time. It was fustrating for me to even hold the little ""cards"" because I thought I would damage the paper. I did not like to work with them and shelved them a couple of years ago. Then I started taking Chinese the past year, bought a set with Chinese characters, and then remembered why I didn't use the Spanish sets. Very good idea, but on flimsy paper/cards."
1,Waste of Money!,I've found nicer jewelry at Claire's Boutique and other kiddy-stores. This item is so poor I wouldn't even give it to a child as play jewelry.
5,Diamond in the rough,"What a find! I love this girl! I don't know how this album came out in 05 and is still an ""unknown."" Sweet tunes with cheerful melodies and interesting lyrics! Check it out!"
1,Nature,"Slow-paced; amateurish; almost PG content. Wouldn't spend more than 50 cents on it, after seeing it. About right for the Justin Bieber crowd of preteen girls."
1,Not any good...,"Read, 'Bruce and Stan's Guide to Bible Prophecy' the cover's yellow. This 101 guide's HORRIBLE. Harvest House publishes everything these men touch."
3,Order canceled by vendor,"Unfortunately, I cannot comment upon the quality of these interesting-looking shoes. After waiting about a week, Amazon has notified me that Shoe Mall has canceled my order. No explanation was given."
3,Do NOT be Fooled!,"If you own the Complete First Season of the My Little Pony on DVD, YOU ALREADY OWN THIS!This 'movie' is a series of several episodes from the MLP First Season. It features the Little Ponies trying to save Flutter Valley and the Sunstone from Hydia, Reeka and Draggle AND Bumble and her band of bees. This is not the My Little Pony movie; that has the little Ponies trying to save Dream Valley from the Smooze (conjured by the witches from the volcano of gloom) with the help of the Flutter Ponies."
3,Part of the box set.,"From the description, ""The End Of Flutter Valley,"" this is the ten-part ""movie"" that kicks off Season 1.If you purchase the Season 1 box set, you get this movie, PLUS the rest of the Season 1 episodes and the two specials.I don't understand why Rhino re-released this instead of the episodes from Season 2, which are NOT on DVD at all.I would recommend that MLP fans buy the entire Season 1 box set instead of this.Please Rhino, release MLP Season 2 and My Little Pony Tales on DVD."
2,Why?,"Why on earth did they release a 'miniseries' on DVD that was already on the Season 1 box set?While a great little show, it seems odd that they would rerelease a particular few episodes from the boxset as a new DVD... and why this series vs, say, the two pilots/specials?Anyways, please don't be fooled and buy this in addition to the Series One box set... you'll be buying a repeat.How about releasing other Seasons on DVD? Or the actual My Little Pony theatrical movie?"
1,Not in good taste...,"Although I did buy this to entertain my 2 1/2 year-old daughter, I had to turn the movie off within the first 5 minutes. In that short amount of time, the word ""hate"" was said at least 3 times in addition to ""numb-skull"" and ""dumb."" Such name-calling and negativity should not be so prominent in a children's video."
2,Disappointed with this HP product,"The on-off button doesn't consistently work. Sync doesn't go smooth half the time. Battery has issue with charging; it doesn't fully charged, and battery replacement is hard to find. Will not buy any HP PDA again."
5,Australian outback movie,"Lived in Australia for 11 1/2 years. Found this movie depicts the Australian outback very well.Had seen this while living there, and was delighted to have the opportunity to purchase it now."
3,PETER FINCH VERSION FAR OUTSTRIPS THIS .,"I have seen both versions of this story.Even though the original is a black and white version, it is so much better than latter version.Peter Finch plays a sizzling version of this man.and made me realise what a terrific actor he must have been."
3,What is the point of attacking Rabbi Steinsaltz in this way? and for what audience?,"No person in recent times has done as much as Adin Steinsaltz to make the Talmudic text available to a wide audience. His monumental translation first into Hebrew, but now also in part in English, and French has brought hundreds perhaps thousands of people into the world of Talmudic study.Jacob Neusner one of the most prolific if controversial and often provocative scholars in the world of Judaic studies has decided to cut down Rabbi Steinsaltz a bit. Instead of voicing his disagreements to Rabbi Steinsaltz's approach in a sotto voce respectable dialogue with Steinsaltz himself he cries out 'gevalt' to the world.This in my opinion is simply not the appropriate moral way of acting.Scholars, be extremely cautious in what you say."
2,Instant Price Increase!,"The two star rating is not for the product. I have not seen my new cat choke up a hairball using thia product, and he seems to like it, so as a product review, I would have given it 5 stars. The two stars is for the instant price increase after I bought this product using Amazon's Subscribe And Save. When I purchaed it, the subscription price was 8.97. Right after I received the first package, the price jumped to 11.82. The one time delivery price is 12.44. That's an increase of 2.85! Wal-Mart's price is 10.98. Granted, adding tax makes the price almost, but not quite the same, but then you have to wait for delivery. This is one of the very few time I've ever been disappointed in Amazon,"
3,Masters the difficulty of fictionalizing real characters,"I wanted to read something that portrayed a German who lived through World War II and took action against the evil of his time. This book does a good job of portraying the difficulties Hitler's German opponents faced. They couldn't get assistance from the British (and were actually disdained as traitors!) and found the early German military victories, one after another, made Hitler more and more popular and harder to dispose of. Bonhoeffer was a human saint, principled yet afraid. This book is a good introduction and made me want to learn more about Bonhoeffer. I am now reading his ""Letters and Papers from Prison""."
4,Quality Case,"This is a quality case for your canon powershot (or similar sized camera). It is an excellent alternative to the over priced standard leather canon pouch.Its slim design conforms well to the shape of the camera.The carabiner is a nice addition for easy access. When you want to get a picture of a passing moment, removing the camera from your belt is far more convenient than fishing it out of a purse or pocket.Inside the case is an extra storage pocket for memory cards or lens cloth. Impressive, considering the slim profile of the case.Definitely a durable material. I am not afraid of dropping the camera when inside the case.My only issue was that one zipper pull fell off. Could have been easily remedied by closing the loop tighter that holds the zipper pull. I assume this is not a standard problem, probably just my individual purchase.Definitely go for it."
1,"horrific,nonsensical run on illogical mish mash,PSYCHOTIC","i happen to agree with most if not all of the authors contentions, unfortunately his books are written in a long nonsensical run on type of sentance and he offers not a single example of evidence for ANYTHING! ...this book is written (no JOKING) like a serial killer with half a mind sitting in a cell writting his world conspiracy manifesto..I swear all jokes aside this book is written in such a jumbling irrational manner i can narry fathom ANY publisher accepting it under any circumstances....the way and means in which the book is written should be a study for psychologists for how a disturbed mind works and writes..This is no joke or pun...This book is HIGHGLY disturbing.."
5,Surprising outing!!!,"Run For Your Life is in my view the Yellowjackets hardest push towards ""true fusion"" and even post bop structures. The musicianship on this album appears to be more serious in a jazz-sense than on past albums. The gents even get a little bluesy on the cut ""Even Song"" which features group founder and ex-bandmate Robben Ford on guitar. (This song probably is a taste of what the 'Jackets would truly be if he was still in the group.) ""City of Lights"" and the title cut ""Runferyourlife"" are absolutely scintillating and a delight to listen to. I've owned this CD for nearly ten years and it continues to enter my deck. Each time I play it for someone, they ask who is that?! Overall, I rank this at the top of their recordings behind Four Corners and Dreamland."
1,Not worth it...,"My daughter is 2. She loves to explore and is fascinated with the moon and stars. I bought this so she would have a better view of these things, however, you cant see a thing. I would rather have paid for a $100.00 one knowing she wouldnt be disappointed. It collapses too easily when holding. Not even worth the $9.27 I paid for it."
4,Pure South American folklore,"It is nice to be able to be the first to review this album. It is a historic record of Los Jaivas. It is some of the most heart felt Chilean folklore music. Also, very importantly on this album you get to see the true talent and craft all band members have and had. Guitarist Eduardo Alquinta and keyboard player Claudio Parra. This album will engulf you from the first track on through the rest of the album. It is the type of record which you can listen through without even thinking twice about turning it off. Brilliant music.Of special mention are 'Oye ninita', 'Todos Juntos' and 'Indio hermano'.If you are a newcomer to South american music in the folklore genre, Los Jaivas is one fo the more important groups. Being a native of Chile I invite all to try this album. It s very good."
4,Christmas favorite,I have enjoyed this DVD a lot. I have watched this movie so much on the movie channel that I decided to purchase it so I could watch it whenever I wanted instead of waiting for it to come on the movie channels. I never seem to get tired of seeing it.
5,How could you not love this movie?,"I have to say that I was not to thrilled to see this movie for one reason--Cameron Diaz. Just not a fan. However, I gave in to the peer pressure and I watched it, and loved it! Cameron was awesome! Jude Law was so sweet and warm, Kate Winslet was so real and very charming and (in my opinion) this was Jack Black's best role! He was adorable! Someone you would take home to meet your parents! Of course everything ends, ""Happily Ever After,"" but at Christmas, how can you not love a movie like that?If you haven't seen it and you like romantic comedies, you're truly missing out!"
5,Must See Movie,"Yes, it's a chick flick. It has a strong cast of characters & is entertaining. It's another feel good movie, so if you need a lift this is the movie for you."
2,stink stank stunk,it was tastefully presented...language & sex scenes were appropriate for all ages. I only finished it to punish myself for wasting money.
2,Do all these authors write their novels at the same coffee house?,"'Tara Road' was released one year before both 'The Holiday' and Debbie Macomber's 'Trading Christmas.' In all three, the main story lines are too similar (even down to the brother showing up unannounced at the house/condo).While 'The Holiday' is too cute and too predictable, I liked Eli Wallach's character so it made the movie watchable but still forgettable."
5,Really Good Chick Flick,This movie was one of the very best chick flicks I have ever seen. The story line was cute but interesting. The acting was awesome. It will be a movie I will watch many times. In fact several of my girl friends want to come over soon and watch the movie with me. My husband watched the movie with me and he actually enjoyed it.
3,The Holiday,"A chick-flick from the opening credits, this charming work of two unlikely actors, Black and Winslet, while far better than that of the obvious ""stars"" Law and Diaz, is the stuff of which chick-flicks are made, a good laugh and a good cry."
3,surprisingly entertaining,"I found it cute and entertaining. Maybe I was in the right mood, but it was enjoyable. Especially for $.99. A good underlying holiday message to not sit around and complain about your life. If there were half stars, I would have given it 3 and a half."
4,Fun and light hearted movie,"For the most part this was a great movie. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was the role played by Jack Black. He and Kate Winslet just didn't seem to ""fit""! Regardless, it is a fun movie and entertaining movie.."
5,Great romcom!,"I love this movie...especially around the holidays. It always puts me in a good mood. I wouldn't put it up there with love actually, but it is still very enjoyable."
5,Truly classical love story,I absolutely loved this comedy/love story. It shows compassion and personal growth and acceptance.
4,Cute Rom Com to watch each December,"Would recommend to older teens and adults of all ages. On my ""must watch"" December list. All star line up with lots of chemistry."
2,Cameron Diaz ruined this movie.,"I'm all for romantic comedies, especially those that take place around the holidays. I had high expectations from the trailers & the cast and went into the theater fueled with excitement.Cameron Diaz single-handedly ruined this movie. She tries way too hard. She was ACTING.Kate Winslet was great, Jack Black always a delight. Their blossoming friendship-turned-romance was just adorable to watch.The plot is a tad predictable, but that's pretty much how it goes for romantic comedies.Skip it if you can. Watch if you must.You'd have a much better time watching ""Love Actually"" -- best romantic comedy EVER."
4,delightful flick,"The Holiday is a feel good movie -- Light, romantic, well-acted about two women who for their own reasons decide to swap houses during the holidays only to discover that the world can be a better place than they have known and it holds delightful surprises. It is, as I said, a feel good movie."
3,Cute Movie - but what happened to the ending???,"Cute, typical, predictable romantic comedy. Enjoyed most of it, Cameron Diaz tends to be a little over the top, but other than that the characters are well played and lovable. However, it appears the writers had no idea how to end it, so the ending makes absolutely no sense and is just a bunch of people dancing around."
5,My fave chick flick,"Realistic, relatable and romantic !!!! It's one of those rare films that has me laughing and crying all the way thru' !!"
5,Excellent movie!,"Great Holiday movie! Travel, romance, break-up and make-up. What could be better? Happy to have it in my DVD collection."
5,This amazon site is awesome.,This site is awesome.I got my movies fast.And the products were great.Im so glad my friend recommended amazon to me.The products were great and of high quality.Thanks Linda Z
4,Holiday,Enjoyed this very much. Was well done and the plot was one that kept you rooting for the good guys. Well worth the watch and one that I am sure every man would enjoy.

5,The Holiday,Watched it in the movies with a bunch of girlfriends. Loved it. Very surprised by Jack Black's performance. Loved Kate Winslet's first romantic comedy...she will do well in those type of rolls in the future. Loved Jude Law with his girls. Cameron Diaz is always dead on funny in any project she does.
4,The Holiday,"I saw this movie at the theater, and had to have it for my home library. Definately a ""chick flick"". This movie was done by the same person who did ""Something's Gotta Give"", which I love as well. Funny, witty, smart dialogue. A cute plot, nothing heavy, just fun and romantic. I saw myself in both characters. I highly recommend, great cast as well, the acting was very good, each actor great in their roles."
1,GREAT AT FIRST!!!!,"When it arrived after returning a noisy unit made by another brand I thought it was it.It was quiet,sturdy despite cheap plastic structure,it had good air flow considering its small size.After 2 weeks the blower started to rub against cage at times, then noise wouldn't go away.Back it went."
1,no way!,"darn! wish i had read these reviews before purchasing! would need Paul Bunyun to put it on - way way way too tight. manufacturer, are you listening?????? will either make my own, or go to Home Depot and get one that actually fits."
1,Impossible to put on,"In addition to the points made by the prior reviewer (except I was able to get the tape to stick), it is impossible to put the quilted cover on - the elastic is WAY too tight. If you get the next size, the elastic is still very tight - but now the cover is too big and looks awful. Maybe 4 strong hands are needed to get the thing on, which is absurd. Buy bubblewrap or save thin foam - and masking tape would probably be fine. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!"
2,not pleased,"Not being used.......does not fit well,no way to snug it up..... did not go on very easly. had to get my neighbor to help, keeps sliding off...wasted my money"
5,Cool Camera Clutch Is a Fashion Winner,"This is a just-right way for us girls to carry a digital compact camera. Everywhere we go. No more missing the shot because the camera's back at home.There's enough room for a compact point-and-shoot plus extra batteries (or lip gloss), SD cards, hotel card entry, driver's license, folding money and a credit card. Key fob wrist loop detaches easily. If you're a minimalist--if you're into moving free and easy--this little clutch is just the ticket. And for those times when you need to carry more stuff, it's still small enough to throw in your regular purse.The styling and colors are eye-catching. Everywhere I go, my Kodak camera clutch gets compliments.If there were any one thing I could change about it, it would be the addition of a divider to keep the camera separate from my ID and credit cards."
1,a masterpiece marred by a misled translator,"Dark Night of the Soul is no doubt a masterpiece, but Mirabai Starr has taken it upon himself to touch it up. Beware of such irresponsible and arrogant work by a translator. A translator trying to cut out the undeniably Catholic view from which St. John of the Cross is intrinsically deriving is likened to a museum curator trying to make Mona Lisa's smile less winsome.Do read this work of art, but find a different edition. We should all boycott buying stolen work at all costs. Starr has tried to pass off work that is not his own, NOR St. John of Cross' as it originally was."
4,Excellent suspense novel that is totally original.,"I am normally a slow reader, so for me to have read the book in only two days, says a lot about its interesting plot and characters.I was very intrigued by the serial killer stalker twist. However, the most original and frightenning part of the book was what occured with the NYC killings. I have recommended this book to many friends."
5,"BACK OFF, OPERA QUEENS","I BOUGHT THIS SET AFTER HAVING BEEN THERE, AT THE MET PERFORMANCES. DOMINGO, NORMAN, LEVINE. FINALLY WAGNER WITH SOUL. PARSIFAL EITHER GETS YOU HIGH OR IT DOES NOT. I REALLY DO NOT CARE FOR THE ""FINER"" POINTS. THIS RECORDING SOARS. SO DOES THE MUCH MALIGNED CALLAS/CHRISTOFF EVERYONE DESPISES. THESE ARE ALL SINGERS WHO PENETRATE THE METAPHYSICAL MYSTERY OF THE MUSIC AND MAKE IT THEIRS.GO FIGURE."
4,Domingo is a wonderful Parsifal,"This is not a bad recording of Wagners Parsifal. Maybe Karajan has given the orchestra more sound, maybe other singers have sung the parts better; but this is after all a very good recording of Parsifal. You may be suspicious about Placido Domingo in the title role, but he makes a fine recording. His warm and floathing voice is excellent in this sacral work. Also Jessye Norman and Kurt Moll makes a good performance. I will recommend this recording to everyone."
1,"I'm unsure what White knew or didn't know, but either way...","I'm unsure what the author knew or didn't know when he wrote this, so I cannot say whether he writes more from ignorance than bias or more from bias than ignorance. Regardless, the reader is left poorly informed.In other words, the author tried to show that some of the Greek Fathers thought Mary had some kind of blemish or fault. He cited Origen as an example. OK, but why didn't he add that Origen viewed Jesus as similarly soiled? If White was unaware that Origen viewed Jesus also as soiled, he was not well qualified to write an informative book. If White knew Origen viewed Jesus also as soiled, shame on White for not reporting this to the reader. The book just teems with such annoyances."
1,A bland and boring disappointment,"This book was a big disappointment. Even when I agreed with the author, I found the argument wandering all over the place. What is worse, he writes with a patronizing tone, yet without much of a command of the subject matter. My seminary prof was right in warning us about the pseudo-scholarship of men like James White, who pretend to be experts on too many issues at once, when they don't really understand them well enough to start with. Don't get me wrong. I like good debate as much as anyone. And I am a staunch evangelical, committed to biblical inerrancy and divine predestination. But face it, White comes off like an arrogant, argumentative bully who's out to antagonize Catholics or Mormons or King James advocates, whomever... and with the same bland and boring style that only convinces the already-converted."
2,Disappointed,"Poor writing style. This book could have been made easier to follow. The chapters are the only division of his ideas. There are no detailed explainations of the lifts. I would not recommend any of his diet ideas to anybody who cares about their physical health. If you drink a gallon of whole milk everyday, there is something wrong. If you want to get big and fat, buy this book. If you care about your health above becoming a monster then look elsewhere for a better book. I gave this book 2 stars instead of 1 because I liked his ideas on cycling. Also, I was happy that I got the majority of my money back by reselling this book."
2,Typical example of later Wrox .NET titles,"Rushed, unorganized. Typical example of the latest books from Wrox, right before Wiley bought them. There are better ASP.NET titles out there..."
3,"A great, basic player","I got this player at an incredible price, so I'm not sure I'd pay the listed price here. I would say it is worth spending around $30-$40 max for it. It is not as slick as the new screens and displays, but if you just need a little something to grab and go, you got it. The sound quality is great, just as good as my sister's $150 mp3 player. Transferring is easy and fast, charging is comparable to all others. Display gives you more than you think. Benefits: can also use as a jump drive. very small (pack of gum); Drawbacks: supports only mp3, wma and wav files. no fancy readout. Overall, a nice basic unit."
5,check out juliana theory,"I am new to juliana theory, but i love this cd. It had more of a rock egde than what I expected. Every song is great, but check out ""trance"". That is my fav!"
2,"Decent, at best.","This album is a shocking departure from the Juliana Theory that created the innovative album of ""Emotion is Dead."" Coming back with a harder, scratchier sound, TJT displays it's inability to diversify their sound. They should have stuck with the same rhythym that merited success with the aforementioned album. Bright spots include tracks two, three, and six. However, for the most part, I am left with the urge to turn my stereo off, rather than to listen to music that, quite frankly, sounds like a pre-pubescent teenager bleating inharmonious vocals, while striking his guitar with the amp at full blast."
5,Excellent Product!,"This product is excellent. The venting process works very well (clears smoke and odors efficiently), the lighting is bright without being intrusive, and the unit is quite attractive. The design is simple because the focus is on the utility of the product. I highly recommend this product. Cheers!"
3,Not bad for the price,"The product was delivered promptly and received in good condition. Things that it didn't come with: the electric plug, the venting supplies or the air damper. Not sure if the vent hoods you buy at the home improvement store would have come with it or not, but we spent an additional $30-$40 on the extras. All other things being equal, it seems to be pretty decent."
3,Great looking hood,I didn't realize this was a convertible hood. I wanted a non-ducted and had to buy another filter at a local store because the one that came with it was for a ducted hood. My fault. I should have purchased a none-ducted model. Everything is fine now.
1,rusts!!!,What a waste of money. You get what you paid for. Ive been using them for 2 weeks. Three knives are rusty already. Wow. I had my previews knives for 7 years. Blades are still fine. Only handles are worn out. Keep looking. Dont waste your money
1,What guarantee?,"I purchased the set from t.v. The thin chopping blade broke in my hand. I contacted the company for a replacement in September 2004 and pre-paid for the shipping of the replacement. For 6 months I called almost daily and sent numerouse e-mails. It is now June 2007 and I have yet to receive the replacement. Don't fall for it like I did. Even when it was apparent that I was not going to receive the blade, I asked for a refund of my shipment payment and was denied that as well. Not only do they have cheap products, they will steal from you!"
2,Sharp but Rusts very easily,"I bought these knives in end of Dec 2003. They are quite sharp and cut things well. The problem with them is that they rust very easily (rusted within Jan) although I never put them in diswasher. I tried calling their customer service for complaint and I was told that they will be replaced but never received the replacement!!! However, later I found out that although I registered the warranty by mail and phone IT WAS NEVER REGISTERED!!Anyway, be careful when you buy them. If I have a choice I would probabaly go with a little more expensive quality and have the peace of mind of spending money on knives that don't rust."
3,dull,My steak knives are very dull. They have not rusted. I do wish they would make a reasonable block for them.
3,Decent Changing Table,"This item arrived quickly and in great condition. It seems like a nice changing table for the price. The shelves are made of particle board, but it does seem sturdy once put together. I had my cats test it out since there is no baby yet. The changing pad is very cheap so I think I will replace that. Also, the strap seems cheap, but doesn't appear I will need that. If anyone is concerned about the color, it is a glossy type white which matched my crib perfectly."
2,Shelves failed after just 6 months,"This changing table has held up well so far (13 months) for the sole purpose of laying the baby on the table and changing her diaper. However, the shelves (made of cheap particle board) slipped out the grooves and bowed downward within 6 months of use. We took the table apart, flipped the shelves over, and put it back together, but within about a month the shelves slipped out again. I keep as little as possible on the shelves to be able to change the baby's diapers, but have no idea how long these shelves will last before being completely unusable. I am very disappointed, but am not even sure what I would do if I had to purchase a changing table all over again because there are so few options on the market."
4,has its plusses,"I got this item, and it's not really as useful for what I bought it for. It's not that practical for packing lunches, as it just has 2 big compartments, and you can't microwave it. However, it's PERFECT for travelling with pets. Seriously, it is the best travel bowl for pets ever."
2,Only good in theory...,"Actually getting food into and out of this container is a REAL PAIN. The four clasps are extremely tight and it takes a lot of pressure to close them. And opening it is another adventure... especially the top lid. It is so tight that it really takes a LOT of effort to pry off, and I'm not a weak person! I'm constantly worried that the force used to remove the top lid will result in the spilling of its contents all over myself and the table. A real disappointment, I'm going to keep looking for other non-plastic containers and stop using this one."
5,Creamy peanut butter fudge with fresh peanuts... delicious!,Creamy peanut butter fudge loaded with fresh peanuts. Perfect for any peanut butter lover... order yours today!
1,The book is subpar,This book simply rips off stuff from other books and presents it in an unorderly fashion. If you want to delve into J2EE please consider spending a few bucks more to get good books on the specific subjects.
1,Nooooooooooooooooo,"The dialogue was stiff and the story didn't flow. The relationship between the two main characters had me wondering why. Like why am I still reading. Overall, my advice is nope, nope, nope. Pick another book."
1,Disappointed,"The first problem with this book is that the dialog is really bad. The characters are in their early 30's and she makes them sound as though they are old. Their vocabulary is so odd it almost reads like they are from a different era. Who uses the word crestfallen to describe someone's mood? Secondly, there is nothing endearing about Drake. He came across as a selfish jerk. I wanted someone else to win her heart. Romance novels are supposed to make you root for the love interests, but not this time."
5,"They work, but you might not need them","I didn't know the 18"" enclosure came with two already. But I ended up using just one of these as I used three holes in the enclosure. I'll probably end up throwing the other ones away"
4,Papillion is worth the price alone! wonderful recording!,"This album explodes with the first track and there is a ton of energy. The recording is just what you've come to expect from GRP and Acoustic Alchemy, delightful! Papillion is my personal favorite--own this one just for this song---Damn good CD!"
2,3 times the charm,"My six year old wanted this toy last year, and we held off in hopes that they would make it color and improve it. He got it this year and it is color, but I have yet to make it work. The first one that we got did not work out of the box. It jumped and skipped so badly that you couldn't watch it, so I returned it for a second one. The second one has a good picture, but no sound! We also got the headphones to go with it, and we can't get them to work either. I'm going back to the store one last time, and not leaving until they prove to me that the one I leave with will work. I'm not anticipating that this will be a toy that lasts long."
3,Met my expectations,This alarm clock radio is convenient. I like that it sets itself automatically. This feature combined with the battery backup assures accurate time even when there is a power outage. The dial to set the alarm could be a little bigger and lit for easier viewing at night.
3,quiet,"All in all it is I nice clock radio, except one very important thing; the alarm tone itself is WAY too quiet."
3,Good clock but deceptively named,"This is a very decent little clock, but by calling it an ""Automatic Time Set"" clock, I thought I was buying a radio-controlled clock that sets itself based on radio signals like other so-called atomic clocks I've owned in the past. That is not the case - this clock simply has the correct time preset at the factory. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, it will not sync to the correct time automatically once the installed backup battery fails. And I haven't had it long enough to determine how well it keeps time or if I'm going to have to readjust the time every so often just to make sure it's accurate. Still, I'll keep it but I feel duped by the name of the clock and kind of regret having bought it."
3,It's always 10 minutes fast,"I own two of these clocks, they're located 60 miles apart. Power failures don't bother the clocks, they start back as soon as the power returns. Both clocks run 10 minutes fast, checking the internet, I see many other people have the same problem with their clock running fast. Reset the clock and soon it will be fast again. There's no remedy as far as I can tell, I've learned to add 10 minutes to know the right time.The price is right, and for those people who have trouble getting started in the morning, they'll gain ten minutes every time they leave the bedroom."
1,Great clock. If you don't care what time it is.,"It's nine minutes fast. Really, it is. Compared to my cable box, my cell phone, other clocks that I have that automatically sync, etc. And there's no way to change it. A few months ago it was only seven minutes fast.From the reviews, some (but not all) other people are running into this problem.So, nice enough. If you don't care to know the correct time."
4,Sony ICF-C218 Automatic Time Set Clock Radio,"This clock/radio is affordable and easy to use. The controls were intuitive, so set up was easy."
2,Disappointed,I am disappointed that I can't adjust the buzzer volume. It's the one thing that I need it to do and it can't do it.
5,"Nice visibility, battery back-up, great price",I purchased this item for my mother who is elderly and she liked it so much that I bought her another. Easy to read and use and battery back-up is great; she won't have to reset the clock when the power goes out.
4,Decent clock but is NOT atomic,"When I first bought this it showed up under a search for atomic clocks.This is a fine clock radio that automatically adjusts for daylight time, but it is NOT atomic."
1,alarm clock,It keeps good time and cheap enough for the price.It makes a humming noise at certain time even though the alarm and radio are on the off mode. That wakes me up at night and I am not able to kill it.
1,Clock became inaccurate after a year or so,I bought at least four of these over the past two years. All but one have become inaccurate in keeping time. I can't figure out how to manually change it either which has me beyond frustrated. Always had good luck with sony products. This is a great idea...but one that has a serious programming issue with them. Don't buy...you will be sorry over time. I now am replacing the four clocks!
1,Terrible quality!,It stopped working after less than an hour of operation. The display went completely deadTerrible quality!!!!!The second item in the same month from Amazon which has zero quality of any kind
5,Excelente!!!,"agradecido por llegar la encomienda a tiempo y en perfecto estado, recomiendo la empresa y sus artículos, me gustaría comprar mas artículos,"
5,great alarm clock,"This alarm clock is a great deal. I never have to set the time, and the alarm time set button is very easy to use. The only gripe I have is the alarm is hard to turn off, the dial is hard to find out of a deep sleep. Otherwise this alarm is well worth the money!"
2,Automatic time is wrong...,"I gave this product 2 stars because it sets the time automatically, except it's fast. I have had it for a year and it was only a couple of minutes fast to start but now it's 20 minutes fast and I cant' change it since the time is ""automatically"" set. I have 2 of these in my son's rooms and I have the same problem with both."
4,"""Automatic Time Set"" is a bit of a misnomer.","The clock works well, but does not set the time automatically. It has a battery backup from the factory that keeps the time. Plug it in and the time is ""set"". It however does not set automatically as one of the 3 clocks we received did not have the time set at all, and then I had to go through the tedious process (more so than any clock I've ever used--and needed the manual for the first time on any clock I've ever set) of setting the time myself. They will be off by a few minutes, so you can check and adjust per your cell phone time. I was thinking they set per the atomic clock radio signals. My mistake."
3,Love everything but the Beep!,"This alarm is amazingly easy to use. I love all of the functions and buttons on it. My husband has OCD and we have to double and triple check the alarm each night to make sure it is set properly. I love that the on/off is not easily manipulated and the button to check the alarm time can be pressed and then left alone and it displays the set time for a few seconds before returning to the current time. What I don't like is the beep the alarm uses. I have no idea who would wake up to this horribly quiet sound. We used our old alarm as a backup for the first week to see if we would hear the new one. Never did. So now we use the radio portion of it. It's very jarring to wake up to that when you are so used to the beep, but at least it's nice and loud! As long as you are willing to use the radio, this is a recommend!"
5,Good clock.,"Good, basic clock. That's all I wanted. Was thrown off by the ""automatic time set"" feature. I thought it was one of those that syncs the time through radio waves so you never have to change it, but it's just ""preset time from the factory"". Otherwise it's all I needed: a way to tell time in the dark, an alarm, and reliability."
2,faulty alarm,"This clock worked for about a month. The features are fine and it still works for time, but the alarm buzzes even if it's turned off. The lit button even goes off, indicating it won't buzz, but it does anyway ..."
2,Broken,"I've had these for about 2 months when one of the handles snaped off. Thankfully they weren't my only pair, but really? Heavy duty shouldn't break...ever."
1,Never worked,"Had something loose inside, possibly a screw, I heard something rattling around. Plugged it in and it shorted out immediately, light never came on. charger seems to work, but I won't be taking a chance on possibly destroying one of my batteries too! Having shipping it overseas, the cost of returning it would have been more than the original cost."
4,"Good book but beware of ""Volume1"" and ""Volume2""","While the contents of the book, as well as how it's been written are well worth the money, I wanted to enter this review to warn others that there are different volumes.I bought this guide book online expecting to receive the entire 1100+ pages. When I received the book, I saw ""Volume 2"" on it's cover. I opened it up to see that the very first page was ""Part III"". No table of contents, no typical Preface, etc.I sent the book back via Amazon's return policy, with no problems, and received the replacement very quickly. However, I now have ""Volume 1"". Parts I and II.Yeah. The description above makes no reference to a Volume 1 or Volume 2. (If it does now, then good. Amazon has updated it's text. I wish they had done so earlier). So I still have 1/2 of a book."
4,for my uncles horse.,"his horse is lil. haha, thats why he asked me to buy vitamins for him, to see if he gets a little big bigger."
4,A geniuos mix!,"The Larry and Lee project is probably the most exciting collaboration in jazz-music the last decade.The record is a superb mix of jazz, funk, country and rock music. The two guitarist get the chance too play with, against, and for each other. It`s no show-off-record but a record which puts the melody and the guitar itself in center. It`s filled with top musicians who know how to play along with these two skilled and magnificant guitar players."
1,don't bother,"Avon plays by their own rules. Your order might get shipped, it might not!! Its sellers like this that give Amazon a bad name"
5,"Excellent Repellent, Worked great for camping","This is an excellent product, I highly recommend it, don't listen to all the pissed off people who didn't get their Avon orders for free and are just venting as they wouldn't be able to tell you how great this product was. I went camping and not a single bite, didn't even see mosquitoes around me. The smell is pleasant also unlike other DEET products I've used."
2,What was the promo?,"When I came across this purchase, I thought it may had been a mistake. I searched high and low to find out what the promo was prior to placing an order.There was no documentation anywhere explaining what the promo was, nor has Avon communicated what the promo was intended to be. Can someone ... Amazon ... Avon ... customers ... explain what the promo was?Publicity stunt?"
5,High quality Image and Sound,"Just to confirm what other reviews have reported before. I receive this product one week ago. I could notice the high quality of Image and Sound of this set. I purchased the complete DVD collection some years ago. The quality of this product is much better. Unfortunately no CC. Normally it would deserve 4 starts because of this reason, but the quality of the product is so good that I am going to keep the 5 starts rating."
5,Ya gotta love it!,"Chatty, easy to read, easy to research question and answer format. Just like having the rabbi right there with you."
4,Nice,It is a collection of beautiful and inspiring short sentences (coming mainly from the Buddhist tradition). A useful approach is to read each sentence and think for a while both at the meaning and at how that meaning can be utilized in daily life. Very nice item.
5,worth it,It was worth the purchase. Although there were a couple of drugs among the top 200 that were not present in this pack.
4,Pentax Optio,I bought this camera to take to Guatemala (didn't want to take my expensive Nikon). This is a great little travel camera or for just carrying in your pocket or purse.
3,Terribly unhappy with the picture quality,"Pentax Optio S 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 3x Optical Zoom, the pictures quality is not up to par compared to my older Olympus Camedia 2.1MP C-2020 Z, but if small is what your after this might be the smallest camera, I would suggest taking it hiking, biking or skiing were light weight is important and fix the photo's in Photoshop if you can."
2,Bad picture quality,"There's really only ONE reason to get this camera: It's tiny. It's so miniature that it can fit completely inside a closed Altoids mint tin. And that's really cool. However, the picture quality is awful, even on the highest settings. Despite the fact that this is a 3.2 MP camera, the pictures come out very soft (blurry), with all the fine details & colors lost in the photographs. I bought this camera after using a Nikon Coolpix 995 for years, and taking the exact same pictures side-by-side, you would not believe the difference. The Coolpix 995 gave me sharp, color-rich, crystal-clear photographs... whereas the Pentax Optio S made those same images blurry and washed out. However, the Coolpix 995 is a monster to carry around (it's about 8 times the size of the Optio S), so use your best judgement when determining what your needs are."
2,much to short plastic tubes,the plastic tubes are entirely to short. i had to buy new plastic at home depot. the fluid evacuator works fine ....just the tubes are way to short!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Decent Book, a Bit Off-putting","This was a real eye opener on how to build a viable and comfortable house with such a readily available material as straw! Seemed detailed enough to get a feel for what the construction would take. The book reads like someone trying to sell you on an idea, which itself isn't bad, but was a bit off putting to me."
2,Shipping package was inadequate,The box this item came in was all beaten up when it arrived. The frame was cracked in several places and the cardboard bacl had several creases in it like someone tried bending it.
5,REMINISCENCE,"The 60s and 70s were the golden years of chess. The best of the best are all here in this book. That was the period where one has really to burn candles to prepare and discover for yourself the nuances of a chess move in the opening. A cloak and dagger way of preparing one self. Much of the fun part, the surprise, are all gone because of an Intel or AMD processors.The book took me back at the time when chess was really exciting, not only during actual play, but the behind the scenes as well. This book is more of a gathering of chess titans, retelling titanic struggles with a superb historical background and most important of all, Kasparov's unequalled insight. Thank you Mr. Kasparov"
3,Order the next biggest size,"It seems to be blocking out the air from outside, but could barely get it on the AC. Elastic was very tight! Did exactly what I thought it was going to be, but it does seem to be working."
4,works great,this item works great for what it is and didnt take long to install. it can be modified for a perfit fit. the cover came with a wind proof lining that goes on first which seems to do the job
5,reading bliss,"This is the most comprehensive book I've run into on the history of belly dance. It goes all the way back to 75,000 yrs. ago, has gorgeous illustrations and lots of entertaining and fact-filled stories. It's a must for anyone who loves dance."
4,this takes lots of time to set up properly,"While the Jupiter Computer Cart is an elegant and spacious unit, and sports a very convenient rolling feature (two of its casters lock and unlock), assembly is not so elegant. Not fun at all, in fact. There are ""blind alleys"" aplenty for the one-time, lay person assembler, such as look-alike parts and an annoying capacity to connect things backwards or upside-down. So allow plenty of time to set out the parts in an orderly fashion, and double-check your work at each step to be sure you are doing things correctly ... and even then, be prepared to curse and grumble a bit.To its credit, the manufacturer has a support hotline at 800-445-1527. (I did not use this service because I opted to problem-solve the assembly for myself.) If you think you would benefit from this kind of over-the-phone guidance, I advise you to time your assembly to coincide with their tech support (basic West Coast business hours)."
2,Needing more meat&#65533;,"I am very disappointed with this title, especially after reading all the reviews. I must admit this is my first XML book. I am new to XML, however not new to web development, and/or application development. So far I've read 11 chapters of the 23 chapters. What I've learned is a lot of terms, theory, and a bunch of baseball stuff. Nothing-real world experience that I can use, also the sample code is incomplete or doesn't work. And since I'm a novice this is very frustrating."
3,Some topics are a little out of date.,"I bought this book about 9 months ago, and while at first it was a decent introduction to XML, I rarely find myself referring to it. I would recommend the WROX Professional XML book if you are looking for a good introduction to XML, and for a reference book."
5,Perfect!,"These shoes are great, seem to be well made and I'm really looking forward to giving them to my husband on Christmas morning."
5,Love this shoe!!!,"One of the best stability shoes I've ever owned. Very comfortable, fit perfect, and great for running/walking. Wish I could buy more of the 2160's in my size. Unfortunately, they increased the price by 10 bucks on the new 2170's so I will most likely try another shoe first."
2,More rigid construction = good support but also some ankle pain,"One of the perks of the upgraded 2000-series is supposedly that it has more stability and is made with even better materials. In the words of the salesperson at the high-end running shop at which I purchased a pair of these shoes, the shoes in the 2000-series boast a much ""more rigid construction"" than do the shoes in the 1000-series. As a result of the stronger construction, however, I experienced a great deal of pain running on trails with the 2000-series. Each time I stepped on a root, rock, etc. (or even on the slope of the trail), the very stiff topline cut into my ankle. No matter how I laced the shoe, it felt like someone was poking me in the ankle with a sharp stick every time I hit an uneven surface (which was just about every step). In sum, even though I'm sure that these shoes might be very comfortable if limited to use on the road or on the track, I found them very poor for trail running."
2,i dont like it,not a very good sneaker to stay in all day bottom of feet hurt nice colors but not good support
1,not worth the money,"I paid $70.00 for this junk. I went to a local store and purchased a pair for $14.95 and their great! The pair from amazon are poorly made, hurt your feet if you wear them more tham 30 minutes, I would return them in a flash if I could! I didnt know they make crap like this!"
5,Asics Mens GT - 2160,"I bought these for my son, couldn't believe the price, they arrived exactly as described. he was very impressed with the comfort and support.I was happy to purchase same shoe that would normally cost almost trple the price (AUS)."
1,Great shoe....wrong size,"The shoe is fine, but either I was given the wrong size in the store or my foot grew in 2 days. Too snug to be comfortable."
5,Awesome,"Great running shoe! I've owned several pairs of the GT 2150 and the GT 2160, both which are great shoes. I have an average arch and am an average pronator, and these shoes are great for daily running (I run about 5 miles per day in them). Now that the GT 2170 is available, you cannot beat the great price on the GT 2160s."
4,Good reliable shoe,My son had this shoe last year and opted for it again in different colors this year vs. the newer version. Good solid running shoe.
5,Where in the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?,This is an excellent game for children to improve their geography skills. They will learn about cities and states of the United States.
4,"excellent book, writing","What a friggin' moron Charles Taylor is, the Washington Post reviewer, and what a real shame, a travesty it is for that rag to have given that reviewer this book. Telling is Taylor's line: ""...turns out to have a port-wine birthmark on his face."" Turns out? What's that supposed to mean? It is a very relevant fact; the fact that one identical should have such a mark ... I don't know, seems like an original plot line to me. I found the characters very real, most especially the father, I thought his affair, the scenes with his son especially well done. This is a strong, original story, well-written, good characters, strong human weakness. Recommend it highly."
2,Lack of Character Development,"The lack of character development in this book was disappointing. There was not one character that I was able to identify with, sympathize with, or even care about. When I reached the end, I felt sorry for the time I had invested in reading the book."
1,"Outraged by price, see P.S. at end","I saw this movie as a young boy and loved it. In my later years I've been looking for it so I could see it again. Now that I have found it I won't be buying it. I don't know what quality this DVD is, but as much as I would like to have this movie it is not worth the price. You are totally out of your minds to charge over $100 for this DVD. Anyone who would pay this price is out of their mind too.Since I have not seen this DVD I can't really rate this product. The original movie is worth 5 stars; however, I rate this product only 1 for the lousy price.P.S.--After posting this review I discovered a link to purchase this movie from Turner Classic Movies. I clicked the link and found this title for $14.99 plus shipping; much more reasonable. The purchase actually goes through Movies Unlimited. I would suggest that you try [..] and search for this title."
2,costs too much to ship,I actually ordered the set of incremental weight plates but was sent two 100 lb weight plates at a shipping cost that was more than the weights themselves. I've heard customer service with this company can be bad so if it sends me a return authorization to cover shipping (which is supposed to be its policy) then i'll change my rating.
5,brilliant,"what can I say? just buy it, it's worth every cent. The man is a legend, I also purchased his other dvd with tony rice, equally as good. thankyou, from a man of few words, but not a lot needed. m.p. carroll."
5,Big Red,"I love these Corelle dishes. Since the dishes are a bright red against a bright white, I call them my Husker Dishes. The red stripes make them POP! They stack so nicely in the cupboard, are lightweight, and chip resistant. The mugs are disappointing due to the fact that they are made in China, and instead of being pure white, they have a very light grey cast to them. Oh well, I still love the dishes and would highly recommend them--especially to any and all Husker Fans!"
1,"poor packaging, arrived shattered","I ordered two package of the 4 place settings. They arrived shipped in a large cardboard box with a small dent in one corner. When I opened the box, One package was shipped in another cardboard box inside. The other package was put in without the extra cardboard box. It had a few of those ""air pillows"" stuffed around. I didn't even have to open it to find out it was completely smashed. You could hear all the pieces jiggling inside. What a dissappointment. I believe the other box was sound, but returned it because I needed 8 settings and they couldn't supply a replacement."
1,Corelle Dinnerware set,I didn't even open the box. Full of broken and smashed dishes. Many items I receive directly from Amazon are very poorly packed and often damaged in shipping. I did receive a promp refund from Amazon but won't find these dishes locally at as good a price. Dissapointing.
5,Wonderful Gift!!,I love this clock and wish they had not quit making it! They are perfect as gifts for parents and grandparents...
4,A useful book on hypnotic scripts,"The authors present a simplistic notion of therapy and hypnosis. Their talk of ""mini-minds"" reminded me of the movie Austin Powers. You won't find sophisticated theory here, but there is much of practical value. This book is definitely worth owning as a reference manual, but it is overpriced for what you get."
4,History in the Making,"Dover produces fine books. As for me I don't mind descriptive notation which turns off a lot of potential customers. But here they have the best efforts of a World Champion and it is in algebraic notation, and has clear diagrams. Some of the games fall short of top drawer play, hence I deducted 1 star, but otherwise this is excellent chess and fine commentary by Alekhine. There is also a tribute to his old Nemesis Capablanca. Altogether a must for any player's library"
4,Inverter,"I have 5 of these. I keep them in all my cars and boats and carry one with me in my computer case when i'm traveling for use in rental cars. It is very handy, it works well for relatively small electric devices, e.g. computers, DVD players, TV's , toys, even my wife's curling iron."
5,Heartwarming and Uplifting Music,I found this artist on UTube looking for a particular song and was so touched by his rendition that I purchased a seond CD as well.
5,Perfect remodel upgrade,"Whilst remodeling the bathroom, we wanted more shelf space within the same width in the wall. This product was perfect! The cherrywood frame is well-crafted, and blends well with vanity and other bathroom features. Installation was easy too. Would gladly purchase this item again!Greg & Sandy Gruber, Omaha NE"
3,Just so you know...,"It doesn't specify in the description, but for some reason I assumed the tiles were all different. I expected at least numbers 1-100. However, it is actually 15 sets of the numbers 0-9. So, it is useful if you have 15 children who are all practicing single digit numbers. However, it doesn't work well for just a couple of kids who are learning larger numbers."
1,Dirty and broken,"My Eureka tub of tiles came in a container that was dented and had a jagged hole in the bottom corner. The container was sealed, and yet the tiles inside were visibly dirty. What's up with that? I gave the tiles one star because I had to give it something to review it, but I really don't what the value of the toy is. We sent it back."
5,Excellent Book on the Rangers!,"My review is simple: If you wish to read a good book on the Texas Rangers, buy this one!"
3,Costume Review,"The costume was nice, but it should have included the tights to make it more complete. And the wings were falling apart by the end of trick-or-treating. Nonetheless, my great-niece loved wearing it, and she looked adorable."
1,HUGE,These are HUGE and did not work for the reason I purchased them. The hook itself was larger than the item's hanger that I wanted to hang them on. I'll use them for something else. But would not reorder this size. I have other 3M Command products that are great. This one is just too big.
4,Good product,"Big fan of command products. Takes all the load and strip takes beating from steam and still holds load. Good product.Note: this is a big hook, so don't expect to hang small items. It is mainly intended for towels and bath robs etc. Also, it is quite big in size."
4,Convenient and strong!,"I purchased these hooks because I am not allowed to drill holes and I didn't have anyplace to hang wet towels. They are great! Strong, I can put them anywhere and I like the rubberization which helps hold the towels better. I really need someplace to hang coats as well, so I plan to order more hooks soon!"
5,You have to check this one out!,"If your child likes music, he/she will love Country Baby! I bought this tape for my 2 1/2 year old neice and she absolutely can't get enough of it. Not only does it keep her occupied, but this tape has been instrumental in helping her learn her colors and shapes.If you are looking for a tape to add to your collection, this is it!"
2,Not for self learning,This book is not for a self learner. Answers to exercises are not provided. Defeats my purpose of wanting extra practice in learning.
2,"A dissapointing ""tabloid"" quiltwork","In an examination of government conspiracies versus the UFO phenomena one would expect greater in depth proof of conspiracy other than ""they wouldnt let me see top secret and or classified information"".This book is a patchwork of unrelated tales where no proof is offered regarding the UFO visitations claimed and that the only reason it has been unatainable are various governments have not spent enourmous budgets investigating each sighting and therefore they are covering up what indeed is suspected to have happened.I'm afraid that is a weak explanation as one doesn't expect paranoid speculation in a government report or at least shouldn't offer it as evidence of a conspiracy as Ms. Randles does in this book.It does make for interesting fantasy as you read the book however and the stories contained within are entertaining as flights of fancy."
2,Boring and not a single photo,"I bought this because at the time, there were no other guides in existance for Kiev. Now there is the Cityspots guide to Kiev which is much better but still lacks bulk. The Bradt guides I find rather boring. It is like reading a novel because there is not a single photo in the entire book and the information is so limited it might as well be a brochure. If you cannot find anything else, they are better than nothing but I much prefer, Dk Eyewitness guides, Lonely planet, Insight pocket guides and time out series."
4,Soothing,"I don't think this CD is as good as Das Testament, by itself. But if you were to listen to that and then this CD it would be good. Why? Because this is like a break from all that growling.Its a very calm CD compared to the other one. Still good. But would probably be better to someone who liked soothing sort of music.Well, none the less, I'll have translations up for this CD on my website (http://www.enomineforus.tk) by the end of this week for those of you who don't speak German."
5,Daring & Overwhelmingly Powerful 5th,"I love Abbado's earlier Mahler recordings with Chicago SO for their unrestrained passion and youthful boldness, compared to the more rounded and polished performances of recent years with BPO. And this performance of the 5th definitely stands out as a untamed monster. Abbado seems determined to outdo Bernstein in the outer movements - climaxes are staggeringly massive and overwhelming. Adagietto is painfully passionate and powerfully moving, glowing with rich orchestral colours. Chicago SO's brass is glorious, woodwind and strings so expressive! Spaciously recorded."
3,fine read about an interesting fellow holding his own against the onslaught of popularity,"Parker seems like a good guy who yanks wine into the modern age of pop culture and instant millionaires while retaining his own ideals. The author obviously likes Parker and is knowlegeable about the wine culture, its cat fights, penchant for snobbery and elitism and jealousies. The impact of Parker and America on the modern wine business in France (especially Bordeaux) and worldwide is detailed and fairly assessed. I enjoyed the last chapter where she provides a fair sum up of Robert Parker and his role in the modern business of wine marketing."
4,Exactly what I wanted for my MacBook Pro,"I was looking for a modest sized 1680 x 1050 wide screen format LCD monitor to use as a second screen with my 17"" Apple MacBook Pro laptop. It works a treat, doubling my desktop estate, has a DVI connector, and the silver frame matches my MacBook. The colours are sharp and bright too. Excellent value for money, especially when I think what I paid for CRT monitors a few years ago."
2,Loose connectors,"First off there are no metal clips on the sata connectors to lock it in place.Second, they don't fit very tight onto the connectors and can be bumped off fairly easily--contrary to the other reviewer here that said they were ""nice and tight"" connections for this individual."
1,Not as advertised.,This brand of DVD-R burns at 2x speed and no higher. The case actually reads 1x-16x speed. I have a 16x DVD Burner. Will buy Memorex next time.
1,TDK Electronics 4.7GB/16x DVD-R,I recentely brought this product. When i am writing the DVD's the player is not supporting. When using the 8x the movies are playing. I would not recoment this product
1,Bad experience,"I purchased a pack of these TDK 4.7 gb discs when they were on sell, thinking that I was getting a GREAT product for a very discounted price. After spending a lot of time transferring videos to DVD, I kept finding that almost all of the discs would have an error at the very end of the burn process (meaning I would have to re-record hour long videos many times to get an actual DVD).At first I thought the problem might be with my DVD burner (I have a Dell Inspiron 6400), but after using other branded recordable DVD's, I've come to discover that the problem lies with the DVD...I'd love a refund, but more so than that, I'd love to have back the wasted hours trying to transfer VHS to DVD with these discs..."
1,50% bad,"It's hard for me to give this brand even with one star. I bought 100pcs but 50% of them were bad, couldn't burn, kept spinning and spinning until you turn off the computer. I will not buy TDK brand any more and you should not buy too."
4,good stuff,good stuff works good lasts a long time 4+ gigabytes of storage space helps me when I record Saints and LSU football games on weekends
1,Garbage,"I've purchased many , many items from Amazon for years and I always read the customer reviews, except this time. I didn't bother to read the reviews because like many others, I've used TDK with great success for a long time. I have never ever gotten screwed by amazon even when I had to return an item.. Well I really got screwed good this time on an item I can't return...Nothing is more fustrating than having to throw away half of the discs because the're no good...Amazon you owe me on this one big time and I'm really really pissed..."
5,No Coasters,"I've used over 500 of these dvds and the only coasters I've had have come from my mistakes. At 25 cents each, you can't beat the price and value."
1,TDKs were a rip off.,"I bought into the name game. TDK is suppose to be a name brand. I went through 25 discs of a pack of 100 before realizing that it was the disks. They will play fine on a standalone dvd player up to about an hour and a half then freeze. They burn fine with no problem but after that, I can't even get them to load on my computer, just the dvd player for a 1.5 hrs till freeze. You can't even skip past 1.5 hrs by index. I have an NEC and Plextor burner and am quite burn savvy. What a waste."
5,"what can i say, they're DVD-R blank disks",I habe not had any problems with these disks. I'm able to burn at 16X without errors. The disks play on all of my players.
5,Swarovski french hook earrings,"these earrings are more beautiful ""in person"" than on the website. I thought I'd get myself something casual to wear w/jeans, but I feel like I should be wearing a gown with these earrings! Good quality. Good service. I will order from this vendor again.Julie M"
5,best solution for big holes in wood,The Hole Pro adjustable hole cutters work great and make nice clean holes in sheetrock or plaster ceilings. When it comes to wood paneling or T&G; ceilings these high speed steel blades are tops. Make very clean edged holes in tongue and groove and cut very fast. Easy to make 20 holes per hour in T$G for high hats at less than a minute per hole. Also are good for acoustic ceiling tiles and most drop in plastic panels.Price is right and easy to keep a spare set inside the Hole Pro case.
5,THE BEST JAZZ I HAVE HEARD IN THE 90'S,This is the best jazz of the 90's. It is amazing what he does with a violin. If you like any type of music....you will LOVE this.
5,Great examples!,This is a great book for learning by example. The text is clear and each example is illustrated with code listings.
2,Disappointed in quality & condition of the book.,"The content of the book, 'Hot Line to Heaven' was EXCELLENT. I purchased it in NEW condition. When received, it was wrapped in cellophane, for protection, but once you removed the cellophane, the front cover had a soiled watermark on it, and the corners were a bit 'dinged'. I had purchased this NEW copy to give it as a gift, instead of a used book. With time constraints of giving the gift, I was unable to return it. When you purchase a gift, especially marked as NEW, one would think it was to be in EXCELLENT CONDITION, and this book was NOT. I feel that the owner misrepresented the book. I am very, very disappointed, in my purchase....and apologized to the recipient of the gift, for it being ""USED""."
4,A good lead-in to his other works,"I discovered Eric Marienthal browsing through the Jazz dept of the local music store and I saw a CD with a guy & the saxophone, & decided to get it. Most of the songs are firmly planted in smooth jazz territory, though the third track (The Sun Was In My Eyes) has a strong funk feel. The CD also shows his development -- the last two tracks are the most recent of the collection and are the best. Overall, his sound is a little standard, but I listened to it several times the first day I got & enjoyed it more each time. It also makes me plan on getting the CD's he's released since, so this Collection is something you would want to try."
3,Ok book but File System Forensic is better,"I liked this book, but it is scattered in its topics. A lot of the information can be found online, and the tools aren't what we use on a daily basis. I'm not sure if any of them are commercial tools in this book.I liked File System Forensics by Brian Carrier better. Even though it had a smaller area to cover it provided a better introduction to the area and I could see how it could be used in a class better. Still, this book does have a lot of good content and makes a nice addition."
3,"Great content, but title misleading","This is a GREAT BOOK for learning nearly everything there is about forensics and how to analyze compromised systems or those under investigation. That's a definate plus for those 'must have' moments. My only criticism is that the book is more on forensics and such, and by the title, I was counting on more about how to build a response group and a plan for a company - and how to actually 'manage' incidents when they happen, not focus primarily on forensics, evidence presevation, and such - but none the less, this is certainly a fantastic resource and we're passing it around the office for a how-to guide for doing the hands-on stuff when we get an incident, and it damn important to get it right the first time so our evidence 'sticks' in the courtroom. This is our new 'baseline book' for forensics, and my hat is tipped to the Foundstone guys for another monster resource!"
5,Love this CD,I heard this CD at my friend's place. I fell in love with the music the minute I listened to it. Great music!
2,Penumbra - a Work in Progress,"The Last Bewitchment has many elements to commend itself, in theory, but sadly remains lacking in the area of memorable melodies that make you remember individual songs. The choirs and orchestral instruments are impressive but need more focused songs in which to be featured. Plus the black metal rasping shrieker really gets to be annoying.Three things would improve this album: 1) More memorable tunes; 2) More use of the female vocalist; 3) Get rid of the raspy shrieky screaming vocals.What is excellent about this album is the powerful combination of extremely heavy metal guitar, orchestra (especially the nice use of the oboe), and choir.My recommendation is to obtain the major releases of Therion and Tristania before purchasing this CD."
3,As advertised,"Item was exactly as advertised. Not as good information as I had hoped for, but is filled with useful information. Item was sold with ""notes in the margins,"" which is why I bought this particular one, and they were helpful."
1,I hated this book,"Dalma Heyn tries to make a case for women asserting themselves against patriarchy by having affairs. What she forgets, or ignores, is what these women do TO OTHER WOMEN when they engage in affairs with married men. As a betrayed wife I know the pain of seeing another woman aid and abet my husband's deception and betrayal of our marriage.What kind of feminism is it that takes its power from ruining the lives of women and often children who have no choice in the matter and often don't know what is going on until it is all too late? Dalma Heyn sets women against each other, applauding the women who take what they want and ignoring the plight of the women who suffer for this. I hated this book, and I'll bet anything my husband's mistress read it and felt justified by it."
3,Basically what I expected.,"Pretty pricey at $83 for 40GB. I probably would not have purchased this hard drive if I had looked around and compared prices a little more. You can get a Seagate 60GB drive for $99, paying just 16 dollars more for 20 more gigs. But, it is a good product, and when I don't remember what I payed (including shipping) I'm definitely satisfied. The transfer rate is very fast, and the design is sleek. Not really being a hardware enthusiast, however, this is probably not the best review to look to for performance details."
1,Disappointing,"I bought one last year, but even at high resolution the picture quality was poor. I didn't expect it to be as good as my 2 mega-pixel camera, but I expected it to produce adequate 4x6 pictures. It didn't!"
1,Novelty only,"This camera is fun, but once the novelty wears off (after maybe a day) you're left with a toy. The resolution is much worse than you'd expect, even for 640x480, or 320x240, and even for [the price]. It's basically unusable if you prefer pictures where the subjects are recognizable. Also, to keep this considered an indoor-capable camera, the shutter speed goes up to 1/4 second indoors, so the resolution isn't the problem - it's the blurred images and poor exposures.Do you remember Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon? That's the kind of images you'll get with this.This would be a great camera for a 5 yr old. It does work, the size is amazing, and it gets five stars for novelty, but one star for actual picture-taking."
1,these things break after a couple of uses,They are really cheap - I've gone through 2 in as many months.
3,Technicall problem,The camera seems to delete all my pictures for an unknown reason. And the quality is not that good. think about it .3 megapixels is bad. spend a lil bit more and get somthing better.
2,Follett's dangerous fortune,I was disappointed in this novel. Follett's staff must have done the research but it doesn't sound like him. The first one was better and all his previous novels were excellent. I bought this for the name and obviously made a mistake
2,"Less than a fortune, dangerous or otherwise","I looked forward to reading this because it was recommended by a member of my book club. Although it was a ""page turner"" I found that it was predictable, and the characters were like chess pieces manipulated by the author. They lacked organic motivation for their behavior so to me they were unbelievable on any level. This is the first Ken Follett book I have read, and I won't be going back for another."
3,Entertaining and fast-paced,"This was an entertaining read. It moved quickly, the characters were likable (when they were supposed to be) and it was basically a good story. Not extremely memorable although not bad...right smack dab in the middle. To me it was not worthy of a full-price buy but I'd loan it to folks or recommend purchasing at a second-hand shop."
4,Great historical novel,I love historical novels and this one did not disappoint. I was hard to put down and I can't wait to read book 2.
2,disappointing,"predictable and tedious... good enough to finish reading is the best I can say of it. After reading other Follett, not up to par."
2,Disappointing read.,"Although I loved ken Follett's books ""Pillars of the Earth"" and ""World Without End"", I found this book to be trite and repetitive. We were reading this book for my book club, and that is the only reason why I even finished it."
4,absorbing read,"I could not put this book down once I started it. The charecterization of the villianous charecters is brilliant, you actuly marvel at thier cunning!! Despite the numerous characters, the writer manages to keep your interest in all of them. A departure from his usual WWII stories, in this case you had no idea what would happen towards the end as there was no actual historical event in the backdrop that we all know the ending to.The only complaint I had was that the ending was rather insipid; almost like the writer was trying to hurry up and finish the book. But I find that the case with several Ken Follet's novels.All the same a good read."
5,Great on trade links with south America,I have loved all ken Follett's books I have read so far. This one is particularly interesting on the early days of banking.
3,Summer novel,"Quite interesting novel althogh absolutely predictable. If you chose a Ken Follett book you know beforehand what you'll get, therefore you can have a good time reading it but it'll hardly be the book that changed your life."
4,Real good stuff.,"Follet's been around for a while and can keep things going. His earlier stuff was more exciting - a new author out of australia is richard greenwald, spear of golgotha- he can keep those pages turning. i think his books are banned in our country- who knows why but he is the new kid on the block and folks don't seem to like it. check it out"
4,Follet's Famous Formula,This book format is what made Ken Follet famous - fast paced story line and interesting characters that you love to love or love to hate. It may be a but formulaic (especially if you have read his other work) but still a very entertaining read.It is a book that you will find hard to put down.
4,Inspiring Oprah,"Oprah Winfrey's inspiring life is detailed in this volume from the African-American Biography Library by Enslow. This book contains information many biographies written for young people about Oprah do not. Many photos and quotes accompany. Includes Chronology, Chapter Notes, and Internet Addresses."
2,Still trying to make this book useful,"OK I got this book thinking it would teach me how to use DirectX to make my own games but it still hasn't helped. The first thing I noticed right away is that he doesn't include all the code that has been coverd in one big group (Its only coverd in little groups with explanation, which is good for learning what it does but slow for writing), and most of all he skips some parts occassionally and never comes back to them. I did however learn how to setup DirectX for Visual C++ :)"
1,To much per chapter.,"I really didnt like this book because:1. He started out with a very large program and he spent like 50 pages explaining so by the time you got done reading about his example you had forgotten what the hell he was talking about.2. I am only judging this book by the first two chapters though, becuase the first two chapters were enough to confuse me and make me turn to another source.3. Instead of taking it slowly and going with just a simple example he has to start out with a few thousand line example in his first chapter."
1,Not what I expected,"I expected a book that covers most of DirectX and what it can do. Instead, the only thing this book has to offer is how to program a 2D game in 15 chapters. The book should be titled, learn old computer game programming."
5,fun for whole family,It is very well made product that provides meaningful playtime for kids of vairous ages (2.5-50)
2,"Flimsy, Bad Wood","Overall a poor piece of furniture.The exposed wood is as it appears: very nice. Our cherry finish matched the cherry finish of our crib (a Da Vinci product as well, and one I'm very pleased with).However, buyer beware. This piece of furniture contains lots of particle board and cheap pine. So not only will you have a difficult time putting it together, you might not get it put together at all. The pieces of wood we received for the drawers are terrible--black spots and cracks abounded. And only two cam bolts hold in the front of the drawers, hardly enough support for these pieces. Because the holes were poorly drilled and the cam locks were bad, I couldn't get two of the three drawers properly assembled. I had to use wood glue just to attach the front. I shouldn't have to do that for $250+."
4,Red Hoodie,Batman: Under the Red Hood is the best installment since the DC leap into superheroes blu-ray style.The picture quality is excellent. Audio is always over the top and the storyline was a double take on Robin. An adventure worth seeing. My 7 year old gives the movie 4 stars. Enjoy
2,Review of Under the Red Hood,"1)Story : Even though the concept is lifted from the books, it is still good to see animated.2)Animation: The animation is average. For some reason it zooms in on the eyes when people are talking lots of the time. I don't know if that is the ""Style"" or they were lazy with animating speaking mouths. The backgrounds and vehicles show no style and are poorly done.3)Voicing : For voicing ranged from average to bad. The joker voice was horrible and was one of the 1st ones you get. With such proven joker voices out there, I fail to see why they went so poorly.Total: 2 bads points and 1 neutral to good item IMHO."
4,Finally a film that has something to do with DC52,"I honestly bought this for 2 reasons: 1. It actually (for real) follows the messed up sidekicks to Batman really are. It shows how it's not Batman's darkness that makes a Robin go bad, but instead we get to learn that it is because of Batman's darkness that he is able to save a fallen bird. And 2. Jensen Ackles as Jason/Hood.The action was tight. The script was excellent. Not too much monologing, just enough backstory for even the most casual of viewer.Great for the tweens and the big tweens also.This film has great action and great voices, a little Joker, all the trappings of a great Batman movie. Now if they could just write a live-action script like this. It was dark and disturbing, but it was supposed to be. Not enough to give you nightmares, just a ""mmh"" momemnt for older fans seeing into the psyche of the ""Dark Knight"". It's worth watching again and one more time. . ."
1,Don't waste your time on this one,"I hate writing negative reviews - especially historical romances (personal favorite genre). But unfortunately, this story is just not worh your time or the paper it was printed on. Bottom line - it's BORING. Nothing really happens and the plot isn't at all unique. It's the same old: They start as rivals and wind up lovers formula. One line that definitely turned me off of this book was: ""The slightly acrid scent of bird droppings mingled with the flowers' perfume."" I like getting into a story and actually feeling as if I'm experiencing it through the characters' eyes -- but bird droppings? Did I really need that info?I struggled to get through it, but I managed to finish it. But sadly, the only memorable thing about it was the bird droppings - and that is something I'd rather forget."
2,"Voice of speaker too harsh, not soft - alarmng","time and time again, these guided relaxation cds have voices that do not lull you to relaxation. There are people with the right kinds of voices for these cds. I suggest you employ a genle angelic voice to your work, you will do well for yourself and for those that invest in that voice. The singer is great, the speaker is wired up."
5,TOTALLY AMAZED!!!!,I am so amazed of how quick the order got here!! You did a wonderful job. THANK YOU SO MUCH
3,Good Compilation - Not so good album,"Acoustic Alchemy is a great band with great members, but this album isn't so good. Even though this album is somewhat of a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation, the songs on it are different than the actual released versions of the songs. If you wanted to buy this as a greatest hits compilation I would recommend it, but if you have other Acoustic Alchemy albums, you can live without this one."
2,Not their best,"I've got several Acoustic Alchemy cd's and I love the group. However, this is not their best cd. Be sure to listen to the snipets of music on the Amazon website before you buy."
4,Slott rocks,"Slott's IRA book is easy reading, accurate, comprehensive and informative. His use of a projected 8% return on IRA money is a bit too liberal in this day and time, however."
3,problem,I have not received the book so cannont comment on it please check this out for me thank you
1,this book can be summarized in 2 sentences,"1) get a stretch ira instead of a regular ira to give your beneficiaries the combined benefits of extended compounding plus lower taxes2) designate as beneficiary(ies) one or more persons of roughly equal age and healthiness, not a non-person entity such as a trustIn fairness, I think there was a third important point that you needed to know concerning what the beneficiary is supposed to do, but I lost patience having to read the same first two points over and over. The book also contains some generalized recommendations such as ""make a spreadsheet of your assets"".In short, a disappointing purchase, waste of time and money."
4,Works great but a little heavy,"This little guy is easy to pack and useful in so many situations. From reading in bed at night, playing cards at night at the campsite, or heading out to the bathroom, this will light the way while keeping your hands free. When you're wearing it, you can tell it's there (a little on the heavy side) and the strap will leave a mark after while. It's the economical way to go and will get the job done. Petzl is a great brand and won't let you down.For those who want to spluge, I'd recommend the Tikka version -- more lighting options, additional range of motion on the light itself, and a little less bulky (Petzl E93 PS Tikka 2 Headlamp, Storm GrayorPetzl E97 PM Tikka Plus 2 Headlamp, Mystic Gray)."
2,BOO,Light blinks in and out at the worst times. Does not keep a consistent brightness. Wasted my money since I need to keep a flashlight in hand anyway.
3,Could have been real good...,"Marsilio Ficino was an astrologer and mystic - one of the precious few produced in the western sphere. It therefore seems somewhat strange that Thomas More seems so deeply uncomfortable with this singular fact and, at every turn, attempts some alchemy of his own in an attempt to cram all of Ficino's depth into the little box of analytical psychology (which remains an admirable field, nonetheless). Psychological insight can be of incalculable value in making mystical and esoteric treatises of the past more comprehensible to the modern reader but these are things which speak to man's heart and guts and soul... not just his psyche and I assert that by contorting Ficino into the proto-psychologist of the renaissance you end up disavowing the greater part of his genius - a tragedy. If you are uncomfortable with the reality of astrology, Mr Moore, I suggest you leave the astrologers in peace."
2,Franciscan Desert Rose Dinner set,We have looked at this set for years and was surprised to see it on line at a very good price. Alas it was too good to be true as the set had many imperfections and we returned it.
4,"Inspiring at times, slow at others","At times I couldn't put this book down. The business stories are exceptional. Unfortunately, too much time was spent documenting his sailing/computer obsession. I'm sure Lewis felt he needed to document that side based upon his time on the boat. That aside, the business stories and history of Clark's accomplishments are exceptional. As an investment banker, no offense taken by his dislike of financial people. This book allows the reader enough information to personally decide how he feels about Internet valuations. A required first reading of many to come on the history of Internet investing."
2,a book about sailing ..,"I heard the audio book and was disappointed, because the author says more about sailing than bussines. Also the books shows only a small piece of silicon valley stories but the cover promises more. The Netscape story is intresting."
3,"Not quite ""Liar's Poker of Silicon Valley"" but a good read.","Having read all of Lewis' work, I do not rate this one as high as the others. Liar's Poker and Trail Fever both have far more amuzing anecdotes. Nevertheless, Lewis possesses a descriptive writing style, and he reminds me of Tom Wolfe in his ability to offer subtle insight. Jim Clark's massive sailboat serves as a metaphor for many things, including the man's character. The final 100 pages were more interesting than the first 170. I expected an updated Liar's Poker, but this book is slightly different, although the message is similar. It fits nicely into Lewis' collection, but his first is still his best. Buy it -- it's a fast and interesting read, but read Liar's Poker first -- it is far funnier."
3,Good but not Great,A bit disappointing compared to his other books. But very well-written with the usual great Lewis humor. Very well researched and interesting although the book really doesn't say much. Entertaining but no real insight. A disappoint for Lewis.
3,Well-written and enjoyable...,"An interesting look at Jim Clark, another complex Silicon Valley character. The book was well-written and enjoyable, though I wish it was more insightful. If you know the industry well, skip this book. If you want a good primer on the Internet and the world of venture capital, this may be a good book for you. The nice thing is that it is a very quick read."
4,The Cukoo Thing,"Michael Lewis humanizes the dot com world by bringing us down to where the rubber meets the road in the Silicone Valley. Where countless author's before him have placed a thin faade on this otherwise faceless, heartless and nebulous world, Lewis has taken us into the home, if not the yacht, of one such company and revealed to us the real motivation, aspiration and inspiration of its founder. I recently read another book that peeled back the faade of corporate America to expose an altogether different picture and I found that side-by-side comparison quite fascinating, if not frightening. That book, ""Inside Job: Deep Undercover as a Corporate Spy,"" also reveals the motivation of several Fortune 500 companies, but the image isn't quite so attractive as ""The New New Thing."" I'd highly recommend both books."
4,Inside baseball,"As many reviewers have noted, this book is easy and quick to read. That being said, there is still a lot of substance. The author's treatment of the Microsoft trial in one chapter is the best I've read.This book, without a doubt, is the story of Jim Clark; serial billionaire. Not having a Valley background I was curious as to how seminal his role was in chaning investors' preceptions about companies. Undoubtly the Netscape IPO was important but was it that much of a watershed event?Lewis notes a number of times that Clark has no interest in the past, but the whole book is really about his past.The chapter on the Healtheon IPO roadshow and the Wall Street Journal article was absolutely great. Lewis can really write.The inside baseball aspect of the book is why did Clark allow Lewis the great access? What's the agenda? Is it to help the IPO of myCFO? I don't think so, but I wondered about the book's utility as a tool to promote not only Clark but at least HLTH."
3,Remembering what it wasn't,"If you're looking for ""how to float a start-up IPO"" - this isn't it. What Lewis does do is deliver an insightful overview of how Jim Clark turned Silicon Valley on it's ear and began the power shift from the money people to those with the ideas.This is a quick, pleasant read that imparts some interesting cocktail knowledge. Impress your friends, become interesting at the water cooler.In typical Lewis style, the non-business reader and MBA alike can enjoy a witty commentary around a significant moment in American Business. In the same way that Lewis provided a backstage pass to the investment world in the 80s, he again takes us behind-the-scenes for a (albeit propped) look at what goes on in the frenetic world of business creating fever.This is a strong recommend for the friend or relative that asks, ""What was all the dot-com hoopla about? What was the source of so much irrational exuberance?"" A nice overview that future historians will use to interpret all the headlines."
1,someone please kick Jim Clark in the head,"I was a big fan of Lewis's Liar's Poker and was hoping for a similar treatment of the dot-com era ridiculousness. However, this is really a biography of Jim Clark -- basically one of those narcissistic, whiny executives who insists that every second of his time is 100x more valuable than your whole life. The problem is, Lewis basically agrees, fawning all over him, hanging on his every move just in case some tiny morsel of wisdom falls from the corner of Clark's mouth. It's also already a little myopic, in that ""visionaries"" with no real business model and a disdain for human interaction aren't at the top of the food chain these days (good thing Clark already made his $$). Interesting, however, for a glimpse into how foolish VCs can be. I couldn't get past the first half of the book, though, thoroughly uninterested in the fate of Clark's big big boat."
4,Well worth the time. Suspense with lots of twist.,Real suspense that developed into a nice romance. I didn't connect with the characters a first but came to love the book and the people. Well written. Unexpected elements throughout the book.
4,Exciting,Found WantingThis was an exciting action filled book with a great heroine. This was a page turner. It would make a good movie.
5,More than romance,"This book was great. Exciting, suspenseful romantic all in one. Well done. Thanks for a good read. I will be looking for this author again."
4,Found Wanting,It's pretty good and the price was even better. Keeps you reading.It's a book for bed or travel. It's nice that you can get so many bookfor such a great price.Love Amazon.
5,Couldn't put this one down,"This was my first Joyce Lamb book, but it won't be my last. She put the emotion into the relationship that a lot of books in this genre don't have. The dynamics between the characters were completely believable. A well written book."
2,Wrong Item,"When searching for a Glock 17 magazine holder, this one came up and was listed as a ""Universal"" magazine pouch. The fact is that it was manufactured for the Glock 36. It was way too big for the 9mm magazine. The proper model Fobus is probably a 6900P. I had to return it."
3,I use this with 9mm mags,"I use this with 9mm mags, and to be honest, the mags should fit a little tighter, the 40 cal mags fit better, but I just don't trust it with 9mm mags."
3,did a coterie of men start WWI?,"This is the abridged version--original is much too expensive.Book's thesis: a handful of men were responsible for WWI; not the alliance system, not militarism, not nationalism, etc. Interesting arguments, especially on industry and banking interests having nothing to do with the start of the war, but I'm not sure I can believe social factors had little to nothing to do with the war."
4,"Even if you don't do needlepoint, this is a lovely book","Firstly, this is a reprint of the Glorious Needlepoint that went out of print. Not a bad thing.Secondly, if you love Victoriana, this is a great book. Kaffee Fassett is fascinated by overstuffed patterns and the huge flora of the Victorian age, plus the visual excitement of clutter and bric-a-brac. He has been able to translate his art into some very Victorian kittens, complete with sweet expressions and sugary pink bow. This design even makes my manly (but cat-loving) husband melt."
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed the test question format of the book, and the giving of explanations for the answers.I did notice that the CD contains incorrect information, so it will keep me on my toes when reviewing those test questions."
3,different,A different twist on the vampire scene. Beautiful women find strange zombies and a woman dressed in leopard skin outfit only to thirst for their blood. one great scene where a beautiful victim is whipped and clothing torn from her body only dangling from the ropes she is bound with to have her neck bitten from behind by the leopard vampire woman.
2,bionic hearing required,"I purchased this for my mother.The alarm beep was so low she assumed it was defective. She contacted Sony for a replacement. Unfortunately, it was no different from the original: if you want to awake to music this clock works fine. If you prefer a beeping sound and do not have bionic hearing I would not recommend this clock."
2,way over confusing time set & DST settting,"Settings for this are way over complicated. Don't loose the book if you ever loose power, you'll need it to reset the time."
3,Does what you would expect,"The automatic time set is why I purchased this alarm clock. It works OK, but I purchased the Sony C318 also which is way better for about the same price. Go with the C318 instead."
2,You get what you pay for,"My old Sony Dream Machine, bought in 1986, finally bit the dust nearly a year ago. I thought of this as a replacement. But -- not so much. The alarm set function is broken after only eight or nine months of use. In my experience, cheap electronics tend to be worth their price and nothing more, which was certainly true in this case. I'm replacing it with a clock radio that costs more, but will (fingers crossed) last longer."
3,Clock Radio Alarm,"Display is unnecessarily bright and all the dots make verifying that the alarm is set a dubious process. The am radio does not come in very clearly, though not sure if that is a hardware issue. On the plus, it's small and compact and I like that it tells the date. Beep function of alarm is loud enough for me and gets progressively louder which I also appreciate."
1,Sony C218 Auto Clock Radio,The ease of use is simple and easy to understand. The sound quality is poor. Too much static and sound is not very clear. Would not recommend to buy.
4,Practical,"A cool clock. Serves the purpose. Also the sleep and alarm feature for radio is a huge plus. However the alarm time set button which is like a 2 way joystick can become irritating sometimes. I wish it had buttons in place of that stick. However, that does not hinder its operation and the clock's practicality.Over all a Good Buy!!!"
2,Sony ICF-C218 Mediocre Product,"I purchased this product based on Sony's alleged reputation for good design and quality performance. Unfortunately, it falls short in both respects. First, the buttons are confusing, and too small for a sleepy person to locate quickly when waking from a sound sleep. Second, the sound quality and FM reception are surprisingly poor in this urban environment (where I use it) with strong, nearby stations. Careful locating of the AC cord helps somewhat, but not enough. A Timex T256 would be a good alternative. I'll donate this clock radio to the next rummage sale."
5,Best alarm ever,Buzzer not ammoying. Green numbers are visible but don't shine too brightly. Accurate. Easy to set. Sleek design. All that is advertised.
2,Waste of money: disappointing,"I loved this music when I heard it as part of the movie. Unfortunately, it just didn't work for me as a listening experience removed from the film. I will probably never buy a movie soundtrack again. I thought it would include ALL the music used in the film but it only included the Shire compositions. I should have read the playlist more carefully. It is quite unlikely I will ever listen to this CD again."
2,Inferior to prior versions,"I've used Omnipage for years, going through almost all the versions since the first. When an upgrade appeared it consistently offered incremental improvements and I rarely had to even glance at the user's manual.Not so with this version. In some key respects it is not apparent how it works even after consulting the manual. There are many more errors in text and formatting. Saves don't even go smoothly. I would guess that something that formerly took me 45 minutes now takes me several hours, including corrections. And I still don't know why the text selection doesn't flow from one page to the next in a multi-page document, as it used to. This product should have been put in the ""leave well enough alone category."""
4,clinical calculations,I bought this book to help me prepare for Nursing and the calculations I would need to be able to do next semester. I found this text to be very helpful. It breaks down math into simple steps and provides adequate opportunities to practice new skills.
1,surprised,"I bought a lot of books from amazon, this time is the worst one. when I open the package, I am unhappy to see that the book without any covering as before it with. and even worse, there are some dirty dots on the cover. Is this the book I spent 51 dollars on?bad quality."
1,The Series is Great--The VHS Tapes Are Unwatchable!,"BEWARE!! I know that it's going to be hard to wait for the rest of the episodes to be released to DVD (especially if you've already purchased and watched the first seven episodes on DVD), but trust me, wait for DVD. You'll end up saving yourself a lot of time and energy. The VHS tapes are in deplorable condition--the sound goes in and out, the screen is fuzzy and jumps, and it's difficult to make out what is going on. Don't try to struggle through it--just wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it in good condition. You'll be glad you did, especially when you come across the more ""shocking"" and exciting scenes in episodes 10-14."
3,need a bottle,"This kit is good if you already have a CO2 bottle. As you read the description of the kit it is deceiving because it states that it has everything you need to convert your fridge into a kegerator, at an awesome price. However, the kit does not come with the CO2 bottle a fact I found out after I received the kit. I have done some research and found the kit at the Beverage Factory for $15 less ($115) and you can also add the bottle, of your choice (2.5, 5 or 10 LB), to your order and a cleaning kit. I hope this helps you out if you are converting your fridge.Mike"
3,Not Sure,"I am still pregnant, but washed this pad and put it on the changing pad. It seemed to shrink quite a bit."
1,Do Not Buy the Board Book Version!,"I love this book in hardcover, but I was sorely disappointed with the board book version. The colors are faded and the illustrations are cropped in such a way that some of the magic of the original work is lost. I purchased this as a gift, but I'm returning it. Still a great book, but just be warned that the board book version doesn't do it justice."
5,we keep coming back,"We keep coming back to this book again and again. I'm glad I bought it as the library, I'm sure, can't possibly keep this one on the shelves. The idea of the child acting as narrator is immensely appealing, a nice amount of tension builds, and the resolution is highly satisfactory. This would even be a nice book for older children to introduce the concept of fractions. I promise your copy will be worn to shreds. Get the hardcover edition."
1,"Trickery, NOT sharing","The narrator spends the entire book telling the little mouse about the big, hungry bear that will want to eat the strawberry. Needless to say, the mouse is worried about this. Then at the end the narrator tells the mouse, ""Quick! There's only one way in the whole wide world to save a red, ripe strawberry from the big, hungry Bear! Cut it in two. Share half with me. And we'll both eat it all up.""The illustrations are really cute. I just don't want my kids to think trickery is okay. I wish this book had been about sharing."
5,A Must Read,"To anyone about to order this book: If you can get the hardback edition, just go for it. This is a story that children, toddlers especially, will want to read over and over again.And to anyone who stumbled upon this title: It REALLY is as good as the reviews make it out to be. The illustrations have a remarkable way of pulling the reader into the world of the mouse. They are bold and vivid. The story is suspenseful and teaches a valuable lesson about sharing."
5,Adorable,This book makes me laugh every time I read it to my son. It is a cute story with great pictures. One of my son's favorites!
4,Book review,"The little mouse, the red ripe strawberry, and the big hungry bear is a really good book. My Little girl loves this book. It is easy to read and she enjoys the pictures in the story."
5,A Must Have!,"My three-year-old son and I have really enjoyed reading this book together. The writing style (the entire book is you talking to the mouse about the bear and strawberry) is charming and the illustrations are just as attractive. The story line is fun and keeps a younger child's interest. Its simplicity has made it one of the books my son has memorized and ""reads to me"". This is a lovely book for any collection."
3,***HUGE****version,"This book was my fave when I was a kid so I wanted to buy it for my daughter. I thought I was just buying a book......not the case. This is the biggest book I have ever seen! Literally! I have to store it behind the dresser. If I had known it was going to be this size I would have continued looking. It wasn't clear in the product info how large it was. Overall, I still love the book."
5,A book everyone will enjoy,"This book is unique in that the story is told through the reader's point of view. You are trying to coerce a mouse into sharing a ripe strawberry with you by convincing him that a bear is chasing him in order to get the strawberry for himself. The story is cute and perfect for very young readers and the illustrations are detailed and pretty much tell the story all by themselves. I don't know about my 15-month old, but this is one of MY favorite books!"
4,Not the usual page-turner,"Was looking forward, as I always do, to the latest book from Greg, and have to admit that to me it was not his usual 'page turner' that keeps me up all night becuase I have to read 'just one more page'. Still a good book, but not as good as his last two offerings."
5,Plus another five stars!!,"""True Evil"" will chill you to the bone and have you thinking twice and then twice again before saying ""I Do"" to anyone. The story was so riveting, it was impossible to put down. If you don't think you can read 500 plus pages in a day, start reading this book and surprise yourself. The storyline is unique, the characters believable (too much so) and the cat and mouse games keep you glued to the pages. This has to be the best book I've read all year and I recommend it to everyone I talk to. You won't be disappointed."
3,Huh?,"If Chris is worth $2M and it costs $2M to kill him, then why bother? Especially since he would go for the divorce.OK book. Not wonderful."
4,Loved it and then not,"I loved this book, excellent plot, excellent character development, excellent dialogue until the last 30 or 40 pages. I think the true evil could have been more subtly displayed in the ending. The author had already given us a picture of Dr. Tarver as a sympathetic character --why not go with that and create a much more believable ending?Stop with the fireworks already, your story stood on its own and deserved a better ending. Perhaps not a happier ending but something more in line with the story."
5,great development of characters,I love the characters and the plot of the book. Mr. Isles has great ways of interlating and introducing interesting odd characters.
3,Not as good as Turning Angel.,"I had more trouble reading this book because I just did not find it very realistic. How relatable is it when all the main actors are medical geniuses, rich, or evil attorneys? I was disappointed. As to page turning, I found it slower in this book interrupted by some small problems in text that I hope will be corrected by the paperback. The main character might as well have been Rasputin for all that she has survived -not that she is a bad character. The end, I think, is too convenient. Reading is an escape, but I felt interrupted reading this by fact I just could not suspend disbelief in the story. I have previously enjoyed Turning Angel and Blood Memory. Just disappointed but I look forward to next book by Iles, still, because he is a really great writer."
5,Whale of a Tail,This was my first Iles book and I really enjoyed it. A murder mystery with all the twists and turns you could want. A tenacious FBI agent loses her father and sister in short order as well as her fellow FBI agent in a hostage crisis gone bad. Despite many barriers and dead ends she finally convinces a potential victim of the grand murder plot. Very satisfying
3,"Jewish Backgrounds of the New Testament, Kindle version","I purchased this required book as part of my Master's degree program, and as my first attempt to use my iPad as an eBook reader. Although I think the concept will have its place under certain circumstances, it's not working for this application. The content of the book is very good. It reads well and is very informative. The real problem comes in when your Professor tells you to read pages 23 to 177, and you find out your kindle version of the textbook has no page numbers. Also, this makes the Index totally worthless, as well as references to other pages within the context of the book itself. Apparently this problem is being addressed with some of the eBooks, but many still do not have the page number feature. If you are buying this or any other book for class work or research, you better check to confirm the page numbers are available in the kindle version, or just buy the hard copy!"
1,Desperate Man Indeed,Houston Marchman is the bottom feeder of Texas Music. Quite an appropriate title as he try's to copy every move of other succesful Texas artists to no avail. Avoid this at all costs.
4,"A very well written and thoroughly informative book, but....","This is highly reccomended. It is humorously written and informative. There is much to be learned by the novice pipe smoker and I'll wager that even a few veteran pipesters will find more than a few interesting facts here. The hand drawn illustrations are elegant and beautiful. Only a few pages of high gloss color photography, though. While this is a great book and should be required reading for all pipe smokers, I dare say that I was disappointed with the way that Mr. Jeffers just breezed right through the sections dealing with the mechanics of how to smoke a pipe. I, for one, need a book that lingers on this area of pipe smoking. From proper break ins to proper packing and lighting, I need more knowledge! Otherwise, a great read, though. Perhaps I'll write the book to answer all of my questions....."
4,Nicely done collection,Get it just for the cover. It will make your wife think you've turned over an exciting new leaf in life.
1,Got what I paid for,"I bought this smoker as my first smoker experiment. I was looking for something not to big, electric and not to expensive.Well that is what i got, but one thing was missing from my original list. Something that could get and stay hot enough to smoke meat. The review below very correctly describes the cheap nature of the smoker construction so i won't bore you with a repeat of those details, however he forgot to mention one other important flaw.....IT CAN'T SMOKE MEAT AT MORE THAN 130 DEGREES. When you preheat it the temp gets up into the 150-165 range but as soon as you put in your meat it goes to about 90 degrees and stays there for about 3-4 hours before getting to about 135 where it stays..Spend a little more and get something else. This one will disappoint you."
5,Communication is the Key,"You've been hearing for decades how communication is the key to happiness in a relationship and without communicating, things are bound to fail. But for the most part, books rarely teach you ""how"" to communicate, they just tell you that you should. I know I should tell my wife ""I love you"" but I need help actually mouthing the words.Fortunately, I discovered two books this year that actually helps me to express my love and devotion in my relationship. This book is excellent as well as The Romantic's Guide: Hundreds of Creative Tips for a Lifetime of Love.Thanks you authors for helping me to communicate in a way that is right and good."
2,Great Idea but too much money for only one ending,"It was a great idea that needed more added to it. With only one ending it wasn't worth the money we paid for it. It took my spouse and I less than one hour to figure out who did it. When we realized that was it, we were very disappointed. Now we are finished with it and will not watch it again. If it had alternate endings it would be worth the money we paid."
4,Axis of Justice,"This is a varied and often disparate collection of music from the Axis concerts as put together by Serj (of Sysytem Of A Down) and Morello (of Rage Against The Machine). It's not like any one style of music from any of the contributing artists, so difficult to define for fans. It also includes some poetry reading from Serj. The album includes performances by Serj, Morello, Brad Wilk, Chris Cornell, Flea, Jurassic 5 and a whole host of other artists. It was put together for a worthwhile cause and there are some interesting interviews and footage on the included DVD. Worth a listen if you're a fan of any of the performers, and there are some good tracks on there, but be prepared for some more ""out there"" stuff as well (hence the 4 stars). Overall a good package and good collection of songs.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,I really tried to like it!!,"With so many of my favorite artists I really wanted to like this. I'm glad I spent the money as I believe in the cause and I really appreciate artists who are politically active. However, this is really just not that good. APC's cover of ""Peace, Love and Understanding"" is so much stronger, Serj sounds soooo bad on ""Where the streets have no name"", I could go on... This is really all over the map."
1,Back to the short stories...perhaps?,"The brilliance and astonishing insight of Allegra's short stories were a welcome proof that talent is ageless and disregard the birthdate when it is bestowed. Her stories shimmer with ever eluding truth and compassionate portraits of complex humanity. This novel, alas, has none of the above. Written in a deliberately simplistic manner, it fails on all levels. As a parody about the generation of shallow seekers - it is too patronizing, as a morality tale - it is too colorless, as a serious fable about search for the Unseen - it is too simplistic and ""New Agey"", as a love story - it lacks passion and abandon. I read it dutifully looking for an opening into Allegra's sweeping ironic mind and found none.After two attempts of failed novels, maybe it is time to go back to intensity and condensed truthfullness of short stories?"
2,Nothing like Kaaterskill Falls,"This is one of those books that I continued to read to the end despite disliking it from the beginning. This book is a waste of time. Sharon is a real loser, but not a believable one. I have no sympathy for her, although she is incredibly unworldy and lonely. I couldn't understand why it took her so long to ""find"" herself. Sure, we all had some difficult times in life. But to go on for 20 years. That's ridiculous. If I hadn't known who wrote this book, I never would have thought Allegra Goodman. It just doesn't compare at all to Kaaterskill Falls."
2,Confusing Title,"If you are looking for a book about religion and how one man's experience with God has affected him, then you might like this book. If you are looking for any real information about auto racing, you will almost certainly be disappointed."
2,"Subpar adhesive, and can view my check inside.","I bought these for mailing checks securely. Firstly, the adhesive is so weak, that I can reopen an envelope without tearing the paper (meaning someone could open it, remove or view the check, and reseal without the intrusion being detected). Secondly, when I put my check inside and held the envelope up to a back-light, I could make out some of the writing on the check. Will have to use these envelopes for non-critical mailings only."
1,Not Self Seal,"You totally need to use glue to seal these, the existing glue is very weak. They can be unsealed without ripping the paper, making it easy for contents to be stolen. Would never buy again."
3,Poor adhesive,The main reason I use these security tinted envelopes is to mail checks.The printed pattern does its job to mask the contents.Another feature that attracted me was the self sealing.That is the envelope's achilles heel.A six year old can open the envelope because the adhesive is more like a post-it note thanordinary lick it glue.It makes little sense to advertise that something valuable may be inside the envelope and thenmake peeling it open and removing the valuable without any evidence of entry.At least regular envelopes have to be ripped or steamed open.Why not use a real adhesive?I'll look for a better engineered product.
5,Very satisfied with product and delivery,One of the great jazz artists of our time. I would highly recommend this musical CD. Henry Mancini was a musical genius and Dave Grusin did a marvelous job with his arrangements and playing.
4,Good,"Interface: Poetry and Selected Readings, Volume One, 2010This is a good how to write fiction book. There are many areas of concentration like fiction, non-fiction, plots, and how to write an autobiography. I would recommend this book to new and intermediate authors."
1,Where's The Mute Button For This Symphony?,"From the minute I picked this piece of trash up, I wished my hands would have fallen off! What a waste of time! I tried to contact the ""author"" of this drek to demand my money back, to no avail! Sean, stick to coloring books and leave the printed page to the true professionals like Chi-Chi!"
2,"Stepping Stone, perhaps. Genius, not so much.","The prose is hauntingly precise, but I could not help wanting to put the book down for all the times its author bled through the page. Brijbasi is a good writer, the problem is that he knows it, and this is evident in nearly every word. It's not quite pretentious but it does border dangerously on a level of superiority that only takes away from what he's trying to say."
4,Very good,Not as good as seasons 1-4 with David Tennant & Christopher Eccleston but still done very well and worth watching. a must have for any Doctor Who Fan
1,"Better than Series 5, but only barely","I must be one of the only people who dislike the direction this show has taken since Moffat took over. In point of fact, I hate it. River Song (a shallow echo of Bernice Summerfield) does not have what it takes to fill the show, and yet the whole series arc is about her. The actors are fine, the the stories and writing have taken a major nose-dive. ""Oh, this show is for kids now."" You know who else used that excuse to justify making garbage? George Lucas, about the prequels. It used to be that the show was overall good, with an occasional weak episode, and some really good ones. Now it seems that the focus is having a few really good seconds or a scene in an otherwise lack-luster season.I've been watching this show for 30 years. Like the James Bond movies, I have no reason to bother with the new show until someone else is in charge."
4,Gift of Dr. Who,"This was a gift for our. son. He has not watched all the episodes but, he is very pleased with the ones he has watched. So all in all this is a very good purchase."
3,Disappointing,"Amazon, son I am dissapoint. I switched over here after iTunes pulled this ""unavailable"" nonsense on Doctor Who episodes. Now you tell me that I can buy/download the HD version of Closing Time, but not the SD version? Um. No. I hope it is fixed next week, because I have a season pass and I don't want to double pay for another episode. Yes, I love Who, but I also like paying for things only once."
1,Amazon video quality horrible,"I stopped watching after 5 minutes because the video played in the wrong aspect ratio and was completely blocky and pixelated. I even chose to download the video prior to watching, so this wasn't a streaming issue. Amazon does not know how to properly encode content."
2,So Sad,"What a shame. The performances by Smith and Gillian continue to be cartoonish caricatures that are suitable (I suppose) for pre-teens, but not very engaging for a more mature audience. In addition, now we have a Doctor who not only condones the use of violence and killing but actually states that he ""kinda likes that idea"". So much for ""the man who never would"".We also have some new universal constants. Apparently ""fixed points in time"" that could never be altered, now can. Good luck to the writers developing future episodes with that immutable constant of the Whoverse now gone. But not to worry, because now we have a new constant as replacement... evidently now the one defining characteristic of the Doctor is that ""the Doctor lies"". How sad that it has come to this. The brilliance of the Tennant and Eccleston years is gone."
5,Dr Who,I have enjoyed Doctor Who for many years and like to have the series to look back on and this Doctor is good.
3,River Song should be flushed,"One of the most annoying on going story lines and characters ever created for a Dr. Who series. She knows everything,but wait she doesn't know a thing. She's been there, but wait she has never seen this place before. Nauseating. The stories that did not feature that character prominently were not too bad."
4,Lots of old information that does not apply to Win2003,"I like this book because it illuminates many of the approaches a hacker would take when trying to invade the system. But it is already out of date for anyone who has Windows 2003 and the latest version of IIS and SQL Server.Most of the entire section on IIS describes vulnerabilities in IIS 5.0 and does not apply to Win2003. Some of the recommended tools from Microsoft will not even download onto a Win2003 machine running IIS 6!The SQL Server chapter describes vulnerabilities that are already fixed in SP3. It does however describe application defects that can be exploited, and tells how to guard against them.So, this is a good reference on general vulnerability mitigation, but much of the information is already out of date as of Christmas 2003."
2,Speech recorder not voice and NOT MUSIC,"Good points:* Ease of use - intuitive interface.* small & light* Good battery lifeBAD POINTS:* Poor Sound quality. I mean it it is NOT GOOD. Once transferred to the PC on highest quality you get a mono wav file quantized at 4bits sampled at 22khz (That is 1/16th of CD quality). Spoken conversations come out fine, but I can't believe there are people recording singing on it that are happy with the results. I tried through the mic and bypassing the mic through the mic connector and it is just Aweful. I am taking this straight back to the shop.* No MAC compatibility. Really what were they thinking?* Stoneage software required for downloading the audio files.* Misleading storage capacity. At XHQ (I am guessing that is extra high quality but believe me it is still only good for speech) you get 2.5 hours. The quoted 35 hours is for such poor quality it frankly depressed me.Honestly in this day and age I expected better."
4,great,Worked fine as expected. Can record up to about three hours max. One of the speakers did not work when I plug in the earphones.
1,Doesn't work with any of my four computers,"It's bad enough that this doesn't even attempt to be compatible with the Mac, but we can't get it to work with our PC, either. There are NO instructions for getting it to work in the owner's manual and no help online either. It's nice and small, and records well, but no good to me if the file can't be put onto the computer."
2,far from ideal,"Attention:Yes it is a monoaural recorder. But its earphone plus can ONLY play back in a single side using NORMAL earphone. What if you want to hear it w/ both ear on headphone? Buy a monoaural earphone from the Olympus website designed only for their products. Really inconvenient if you want to use the recorder itself to hear the recording.Btw, the record effect is not satisfactory too. I used in a small classroom, 5 feet from the speaker. The content is... blur."
2,Rather disappointed.,"Black and white format. Stitch diagrams reasonably good, though not many different stitches included. Styles of projects included outdated. (May be coming back in to fashion though, as the featured quilt seems to have a ""peace sign"" as it's main theme.) This book does not really come close to the Victorian crazy quilt books that are currently on the market. For the price, it might not be a bad addition to a library on CQ, but I think I'd pass it up otherwise"
2,Editing Please!!,"Interesting subject matter, but poorly written. The author repeats herself excessively, to the point that she actually insults the reader's ability to recall the connections that were made a few pages earlier. I get it already, tell me something new! There has to be a biography about Natalie out there that has more substance, less repitition, and better editing!"
3,Excellent story but badly written,"While Hollywood types are not my cup of tea, Natalie Wood had an undeniable impact on my generation. The writer beats to death the notion that her mother set her up for a fall. It's almost as if this book was written in small segments over time, and then fused together - the repetition of this notion was repeated over and over. However the story content is riveting - although her meeting with Khruschev was omitted, and I am sure lots else was also - you can plan to read this over a long weekend because you won't be able to put it down. But you'll never feel the same about Hollywood, or the Catalina police dept."
2,Overwrought,"I agree with several of the other reviewers that this biography could have benefitted tremendously from a better editing job. Finstad's extreme repetitiveness grew quite tiresome by the end of the book (the stage mother, the gypsy, the water, the wrist-brought up time and time again).Her depiction of the events on the night of Wood's death was interesting, as were the descriptions of her relationships with various co-stars. However, the tone of the book, with its excessive italics and overwrought, repetitive tone, was annoying."
4,A Real Gem,"This is an excellent police procedural in the serial killer genre. Devlin's characterizations are strong; and the main characters, though familiar in their outlines, have enough nuances to make them individual and three dimensional.The writing is very insightful, and Devlin's analysis of the complexities of relationships is spot on target. The antagonists are real, with such tragic bends in their psyches as to render them pitiable while at the same time revolting. The backdrop in San Francisco is a nice change from so many stories of this type set in NYC. Devlin is an excellent writer and storyteller, and I eagerly await his next novel--hoping it's a continuation of the relationship between Rose, Joshua, Seamus, and murder."
4,Its OK,"Kinda of confusing, but I'm from the area, so I have to show love. It's a cool video though...there are alot of funny moments so it's worth it."
5,Wheels,"Great product. Even though I ordered the wrong ones, I was able to modify them and make them work. I will be more careful next time. Again - Great product!"
3,Program is really good...If it doesn't crash,"I found the program easy to install. The interface could be more user-friendly, but not out of line with other OCR software I've tried. The document conversion itself is excellent. I found very few errors, and it is certainly nice to see an OCR program handle and maintain formatting. I've been using it to scan in articles for reprint in a historical publication. Some of these articles come from a source with three columns and pictures. Omnipage 15 handled these flawlessly.Now for the big drawback. Halfway through the project, anything I scanned crashed Microsoft Word, losing any information I'd worked on. I am under a very intense deadline for the publication. Nuance has a chance to rehabilitate the bad reputation of the OCR development community, plagued by a realistic question of whether to retype from the original source or to use the OCR. It's still a gamble on whether OCR products save time in the long run...The verdict is still out in my case."
3,Didnt fit my vehicle,"Amazon has this listed for my make and model, however it doesn't fit my car.I triple checked to make sure I entered all the correct info. I lost money by purchasing from Amazon.I was a first time buyer from this site, not a good impression."
1,"Worst pitcher ever made, lid is useless, spills everywhere","The green circle flip-up part of the lid falls off every time I pour out of the pitcher. Some reviews say the lid is hard to get on. My lid just sits on top, not really making any kind of seal. Basically, I might as well just have a huge open container in the fridge. This thing is completely useless.The person who decided this lid was fit for manufacture needs to be fired. I will go out of my way to buy a non-Sterilite pitcher now."
3,a correction,"OK, I NOTICED THAT ONE REVIEWER SAID THUS:The book has...(a)...quiz in an appendix...The scoring scheme tells you to add your scores, add another number (118) and then divide by 264. Doing that means that everyone fails the test, even if you put down all of the optimum answers. My guess is that you are supposed to divide by 2.64 or by 2.4, but I cannot tell.ACTUALLY, YOU MISSED A VITAL POINT: IT SAYS TO ADD 100 AFTER THE DIVIDING BY 264.Perhaps the proof reading will improve on the second printing of this book (if there is one)PERHAPS IT WAS READER ERROR?"
2,WHO PUT THIS COMPILATION TOGETHER?,"Clearly not a REAL George Howard fan. How could you leave out ""Love Will Conquer All"", ""September Rain"" , ""Slow Walking"" , ""Jade's World"", ""Sweetest Taboo"" , or ""Stanley's Groove"" ? Hey,the list goes on.Love Will Follow is probably his best CD and only one song from that album made it on the compilation. Where's the justice?Whoever said this was the best CD, CLEARLY is not a George Howard fan, has not listened to any of his CD's, or probably only owns this CD."
3,It works,If you're looking for even a decent speaker for the radio look somewhere else. This one is really tinny. It is easy to set and since the radio is only used for a few minutes as a pre-alarm I can stand it.
2,Not loud enough,The clock is easy to set and the fact that is has an auto set after power outages is great. The people at Sony however forgot that the main purpose of an alarm is to wake people up. The small beeps that come out of the alarm is not enough to wake me or my husband up and therefore I can only give two stars.
3,Happy but then disappointed!,"I was so happy with the size of the radio, with the white color, and with the easy way to set the alarm, etc.But .......when the radio comes on it sounds very tinny. I don't know how to describe it.. The buzzer sound is fine.I have a radio almost 50 years old that I obtained for free with the purchase of many school books. It still has the most beautiful sound.It is so large that I was hoping for a smaller one to give me more room on the stand by the bed."
3,Nice clock - very DIM numbers,"The delivery was very prompt - I purchased the clock because of the Sony name and the automatic reset on the clock. However, if this clock is in a room with very much light, you cannot see what time it is - the numbers are only seen in very low light or darkness - something to think about when ordering this clock."
2,You'll sleep through the alarm.,"Aesthetically or structurally there's nothing wrong the the clock. It looks neat, has plenty of options and the duel alarm function is great. However, if you are a heavy sleeper and prefer the ear-screeching repetitive tone of the alarm to wake you up, you may be out of luck. I like to place my alarm clock downstairs, thus assuring that I will get out of bed to turn off the alarm without being tempted to hit the snooze. Unfortunately, the tone signal is so weak, I cannot count on the alarm to wake me up. I will say that the if you set the alarm to the radio function, you will have a much louder awakening. But if you prefer the lifeless beeping of the alarm rather then the annoying chatty voices of morning radio announcers, you should find another clock."
1,stupid design,"impossible to figure out how to do the simplest things, like setting the itme. Waste of money. Could not be less user friendly."
5,Perfect for me.,Clock is small enough to fit on my overloaded nightstand. Brightness can be dimmed low enough to not bother me at all in the dark of the night. Alarm setting is simple. Double alarms come in very handy.
3,The Green LED light dies off fast.,"I bought the Sony Alarm 5 months ago, and it worked great until recently. For some unknown reason, the green LED light just became very weak, and I can hardly read any number during the day. Originally I thought I may have accidentally turn down the brightness of the display, but there is no option to adjust the brightness. It just does not work as well as before.Other than that, the setting is very easy, and it automatically adjust for daylight saving. For the price I got, I can't complain."
5,Sony alarm clock,"Love the clock. The automatic time set did confuse me. I thought it referred to the atomic signal from Fort Collins, Colorado. The automatic time set is nothing more than battery backup. But nevertheless I still love the clock. It keeps good time. I purchased two of them and the times are identical on both clocks."
1,Beeps even when unplugged!!,"I do NOT like this alarm clock. It does not always change for Daylight Savings even though is supposed to. It started beeping at 5 a.m. when the alarm was not set. Annoyed, I unplugged it. Now the alarm has gone off 3 times while unplugged - always at 5:00 or 5:15! I moved it to the living room but still heard it. For some reason, today it beeped every ten minutes after 5:00. I was going to throw it in the trash, but it will go to Goodwill. Maybe someone else can use it as a radio."
1,What happened to Sony's radio sound - tone/tune?,"The radio sound of this Sony ICF-C318 is really grating and unpleasant. What a surprise. I have enjoyed lots of Sony clock radios in the past and when the sound died with one of those I ordered this new one from Amazon. This is not a radio one can enjoy listening to, sorry to say."
1,Not accurate and alarm way too soft,"After plugging in the clock and having the time set automatically, it lost four minutes in only a few hours. I re-set it and the same thing happened again, four minutes behind. (I just read another review that says it was supposed to be an atomic clock, but after re-reading the product description I still see nothing saying it is atomic.) Also, the alarm feature is way too soft. When I found the setting on the side for ""loud"" or ""soft,"" I thought that would fix the problem. Then I realized it already WAS on loud! I should have read the reviews first. I see I'm not the only one with issues on the alarm volume. I sent it back for a refund."
3,"A little too big, in my opinion","Great features at an affordable price. I was excited when I ordered this clock radio from Amazon. But when I received it I was surprised to see how big it was. It seems much larger than most clock radios I've seen, even the late 1980s-model it was to replace. This size made the bright white case stand out even more, and it looked odd on my nightstand. So I returned it and plan to look for a smaller model with similar features."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"I'm very particular about alarm clocks, and this one is perfect. Its not too bright, yet bright enough. The radio works perfect, volume control is exact, unlike my last alarm that seems to go from loud to off. The buzzer is nice, not outrageously annoying, and I love how it slowly gets faster and faster. The buttons are all easily identifiable by touch."
2,Nice but very quiet alarm,"The radio works great as do the dual alarms. Everything works as you'd expect and makes common sense.The only disappointment is that the alarm is very soft. There's a high/low switch, but the difference between the 2 levels is almost imperceptible.Other than the alarm it's a nice clock radio."
2,display could be brighter,"The radio reception is very poor. And, the display could be brighter...the only time I can easier read it is in the dark."
5,Sony Clock Radio,I received the clock in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I found it easy to set up and use and would probably purchase this brand of product again.
2,wouldn't tune the station I wanted,"Great features, except it wouldn't tune in 88.1 that I listen to all the time.Would have been fine for a more powerful commercial station, probably."
1,Time never set correctly,"So there is NO place to manually set the time on this thing. Apparently the atomic clock is supposed to set itself. Well, almost a week later, and the thing is completely on a random time. Wasn't even worth returning it to Amazon as I had already thrown away the box and manuals. Tax donation to Salvation Army is where it ended up."
4,Clock radio,The auto time set is great. The good points are battery back up and the dimmer option. It also has dual alarm settings which can be useful. Good value.
1,Extremely disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed by this book. I thought it was a book about how to architect Java applications. It is not. While I appreciate the book's goal of providing practical examples, it is nothing but an example of building one particular application. It's not much more than a tutorial. I want a book of principles, guidelines, best practices for building Java applications - a series of general principles that I can apply to any situation. O'Reilly books are normally great; I bought this book largely because it was from O'Reilly. Big mistake. If you want a book of general principles for how to design a Java enterprise app, Core J2EE Patterns is excellent and much better than this one."
5,A long awaited book on enterprise system design,"This book kept me absorbed from first to the end. I learnt lot of interesting and important stuff otherwise, I would have missed in my design. The book begins with an imaginary organization in need of computerization. Author starts with data modelling, how we could use LDAP to authentication to authorization, ejb components and usage and finally using an example of JMS. Lots of trips and techniques of good design is illustrated. The author gradually improves the design from previous chapters and and also keep changing the code accordingly. I am glad I bought this book and I am eager to see the next two book in the series."
3,"Useful book, but too verbose and too many errors.","This book teaches principles and patterns of applying J2ee technology by an example. It worth a read. I bought the book, and finished reading it for 4 days. I did learn some designs I don't know before. But I doubt if the book is worth the price:1. It is too verbose. Very often a simple idea which can be explained in one sentence is explained in one whole page. I hope the author can supply a -v option, so that I can read it more efficiently. This 300 pages book can be reduced to 150 pages.2. The Figures in the book contains too many errors. Most of the E-R diagrams in the book are wrong. This is appearantly not the fault of the author. I think the editor in O-Reilly should be fired.My suggestion is that if you can share a book with a friend, then don't buy it. It just worth one read."
2,Not impressed,I have been using this product for the last 3 weeks now and all it has accomplished is turning my areas orange. I am not seeing much on the fading of my dark spots as of yet. Thought it would be worth a try for the price. But I do not see it as an effective method to removing dark spots on skin.
1,WARNING - EDITED VERSION!!!,"I accidentally ordered this CD, thinking that it was remastered and the other version(not marked as ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED) wasn't. This is actually the EDITED VERSION. Amazon has not clearly identified each version as EXPLICIT or EDITED. I can only assume that the other version is the explicit one, but don't take my word for it. Buyer beware!"
4,Great tool for teenagers,"I teach Confirmation at our church to our 8th graders, and I buy a copy of this book for all of the students every year. It is a great tool for them to have and reference back to in knowing there is logic and evidence to the Christian faith. The only criticism I might have is that the wording might be a little simpler for teenagers, but the chapters are otherwise a very easy and engaging read for them."
2,not very conclusive,This book backs up its claims with Bible verses its like saying the Bible is true because the Bible says so. It won't sway anyone
4,An engaging piece of literature however....,"""Jedi bounty"" surely is a most engaging piece of literature..however it does exhibit some tendencies which greatly lowered my opinion of the novel. First, it is not consistent with the other 5 novels in that story line. As in, the other 4 represent more off character tendencies for the series, and therefore this is refreshingly authentic. However the mere fact that it does not coincide with it's counter-parts is a blow to it's credibilityDo not get me wrong i enjoyed this book Very much, I just found that it stood out from the other 4 a little TOO much"
5,Why Oh Why can't you get the box sets!!!!!!!?????,I love this show soooo much! I cry at every one coz its so close to life. I live in England and they are totally unheard of now. I really want the tapes. Can anyone out there give me a hint on how to get them as no where I know ( shops or on the net) can get hold of them and I'm going CRAZY!!!!!
1,defective,I am extremely disappointed in this product. At least 50% of these disks fail to be written and produce an error message. I will not reorder again.
1,First two discs bad so far,"Well, I just purchased this from amazon because of the great price. I just opened the package and so far the first two discs failed in the middle of the burn due to bad media. Hopefully I have success with the rest or this will be a bad investment. I read the other reviews and they were all good. But I have to give this item a bad review. I usually get maybe 2 bad discs per spindle, but I have never gotten two right out of the package.Update: Third attempt to burn was a success."
1,DVD disks do not work,I just bought 100 TDK DVD disks from Amazon and they do not work. They stop after about 15 minutes of recording.I have used Sony and Memorex DVD disks with no problems on my recorder.I am out $15.00Save your Money get a good Brand
1,Not what they once were,"For the longest time I was a TDK fanboy.All the negative reviews I rebutted.""Best value DVD+/-R's on the market"", I would say.I've just had a spindle with >60% failure rate.I'll never buy TDK again.So sure was I that TDK were not at fault that I bought two (TWO!) replacement burners.At least I now have 3 burners.Buy Verbatim. Buy Sony.DON'T buy TDK.The Internet (which is NEVER wrong) says that RiTek make TDK disks now, which should explain everything."
3,Not Always Reliable,"I have bought these a number of times, but this last batch are mostly coasters. The extreme outside edge has a smattering of ""sparkles"" that seem to not want to enable burning on the last 10 percent of the disc. I will most likely NOT buy these again, due to the pile of discs in my trash. Previous orders have been excellent, but I will not chance another wasted order."
1,They are really bad,"I bought these TDKs when my sonys ran out. They were way cheaper than the sonys and i've used tdk's cd-rs which worked great. But tdk's dvdrs really suck. I tried burning an ISO on the first disc and i got an error. Then i burned another disc which completed but my ps2 couldn't read it. Then i burned a movie and it wouldn't play in my dvd player. Then i tried to burn another one and my ps2 didn't read it. I can hear my burner struggling to burn these discs. The discs also seem alot different than my sonys. The TDKs seem alot thinner and cheaper. I guess you get what you pay for. But i still wasted $25, which i am really mad about. Now i have 96 dvdrs just sitting there, they might as well go in the trash. Useless. It is better to spend the extra money for a good brand, at least you won't be like me and spend $25 for absolutely nothing."
3,"Good product & price, bad packing for shipment","Good deal on quality DVDs, but the packing for shipment was terrible. When opened, the covering had separated exposing the discs. They are working OK, but it can't be good for them."
5,Gives the reader the truths that our government hides.,"Filled with unknown information to todays politically correct world of lies. Gives proof that communism and totalitarianism's tyranny is as much of a threat today to America as it was to Russia during the Jewish revolutions after WW1. It fully explains how the government exploits the nation's ill race relations and in fact promotes racial hatred in order to ""control"" the masses, ironically. --This book may be out of print here, but every Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) bookstore carrys it. Also check out the book ""Behold a Pale Horse"", another book written by a Christian, former government leader."
1,Buyer's beware is right!,"I wish I would have read these reviews before I bought this CD,really wanted a copy of Boogie with Canned Heat,but the radio version of Fried Hockey boogie sucks! Will probably give it away."
2,It didn't work for me,"I was not surprised that this product didn't do anything for my Tinnitus after several applications. One more item in my list of failed attempts.I don't recommend it. Directions: Shake well, moisten cotton ball and place it into ear for 2-4 hours."
4,Emily 3 in 1 Crib,Every sturdy. Worth the cost.con: I'm 5 ft and I need to tip toe to get baby over top rail and down into a very low level mattress. (The mattress is at the highest level)
5,Excellent buy !,My wife liked this crib the moment she saw this crib at our friends place. And the reviews on Amazon helped us make the decision.The assembly was very easy. Looks elegant and is sturdy. Too early to say if my 3 weeks old likes it too :). But she sleeps peacefully in it.
5,Stellar Product,Attractive and easy to put together. Since purchasing/assembling the crib for the first time...the crib has already been through one cross country move (with minor disassembly & extra padding) with no damage.
5,DaVinci Emily Crib,"We purchased this crib as a gift for our first grandchild. It arrived in just a few days, and my son-in-law had it assembled in less than 30 minutes. It seems to be very sturdy and looks great in the nursery. We love the fact that it is transitional and can be used for a very long time. Can't wait for the arrival of our new little one to try it out."
4,Insufficiently packed for shipping,"It took me about a month to get this crib after I ordered it. The first two cribs that were sent to me were broken when they got here, with wide cracks and some pieces broken in half. I finally kept the third crib, even though it was dented and chipped, because my baby needed a bed and I just couldn't wait any longer. Amazon gave me a discount and a free teething guard to cover the most obvious damage, but I am still disappointed that the brand new crib I bought looks so beaten up. I really wish they would pack the crib more securely at the warehouse to prevent damage in shipping.The crib was pretty easy to put together by myself. It is sturdy and looks nice. I would have given it 5 stars if I would have received it in brand new condition, on time."
4,Great Crib,I'm still 9 months pregnant and we just received our crib on Saturday. We noticed that it was damaged from the bottom when it was shipped which I should have known because the other reviews said that their packages were damaged as well. Not too much you can do about it now anyway. We bought our mattress from Wal-Mart for about $38 and when I put it in the crib it fit perfectly. I'm a pretty short person - 5'0 - so the height of the crib is great as well - we put it on the highest level. The color matches perfectly with our bedroom furniture which is cherry also. The only problem is that the crib does not give instructions on how to convert the bed to a full size bed. Maybe if we order the rails we'll get the instructions - not too sure about that one.Enjoy!!
3,"Nice product, poor assembly materials","Not a bad crib in general, but my major complaint is in putting it together. Every bolt and screw has a hex head. This is such a pain and only using the included hex wrench is a pain. Do yourself a favor and buy a hex set from your hardware store, it will be a little easier. I don't know why they wouldn't just make them with a phillips head. After some frustration, it went together and feels solid."
5,Great Crib,This is the second DaVinci Emily crib I have purchased for my granddaughter. The first for her home and the second for my home. This crib is easy to assemble and to adjust bed height. The slats are narrow enough to prevent little baby arms or legs from getting caught. The price is very resonable compared to similar type cribs. Plan to convert it to a toddler bed in a few months.
5,Beautiful Crib,"We just bought this crib in cherry for my daughter. It really is a beautiful crib. The color is gorgeous, the size is perfect for her nursery, and I love that it will convert to a toddler bed when she gets older. Would definitely recommend to anyone!"
4,Great Buy!!,"I ordered this at Christmas with the free super saver shipping. The crib arrived within a week. Assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable. It's attractive, but my only complaints are 1)it did arrive with about five different chipped/gouged areas in the white paint (this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint) and 2) the bolts are exposed on the crib-it would have looked better if they had provided caps. Overall, I'm very happy with the crib AND the price- can't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in May!"
4,Love it!,"We love our crib. This was a Consumer Reports recommendation and we decided to get it in the Oak color. It is well made and nice looking. My parents paid for the crib as a baby gift and came over the other day to see it assembled and just loved it! I'm much shorter than my husband and it was important to me to have an adjustable mattress height. I will have no trouble getting the baby in and out of this crib. We'll get to start using it in the next month and we are so excited to have such a great looking crib to bring our new baby home to. (One note: all holes were pre-drilled and we sailed through putting it together until the very end when one of the pre-drilled holes didn't line up right. Fortunately my husband is handy and was able to figure out a solution, I've read other reviews that had similar trouble, so don't wait until the last minute to assemble this in case you have problems and need to exchange this)."
1,Color not accurate,The oak color looks nothing like it does in the online photos. It is ugly and very orange and fake looking. We ended up buying white instead and are very happy with that crib.
2,BEWARE!! SHOP A LITTLE!,"First off, this is written by a customer that purchased the crib and not an employee. (just read some of the reviews) very entertaining! This was rated a very safe crib and that is the only reason it is not going back to the company that manufactured it. This was the worst piece of equipment that I have ever assembled. The wood is extremely too soft. None of the hardware matches the pre-drilled holes, that it needs too in order to assemble. The stickers which are in place to designate the parts, are on the inside of the joining part! So after you assemble you have no idea which piece is which. The manual has no actual instructions, just pictures. Would not be an issue if the crib was good quality. Just me assembling it produced several cuts and scrapes in the finish. It does look nice, however so does a nice new Hyundai, but most of us know we would rather have the Lexus.:) Just be careful shop around, I WOULD NOTrecommend this crib!"
5,The most amazing album I've ever heard,"Why doesn't BT do more albums like this? The answer is that he can't. This album is absolutely flawless, and will be remember in the future as one of the greatest albums of all time. He can never repeat such pure genius. BT's mix of trance, rock and classical music takes you on a journey to a place you never thought existed. This album has touched my life in so many ways. If you haven't heard this album, get it now, you will never regret it."
2,got it . It is worh the extra $$$ for the barton,"People, for doing this over 10 years and AMD doing the whole shpiel about it not being ""true"" speed is crap. waste a lil more money toward a barton chip it is really worth it. they are ALOT more stable when overclocked! ALSO IMPORTANT: buy another cpu core cooler like a thermaltake volcano series where u can crank the suckers up to 4800 rpms!!! this keeps them from overheating the ones that come in box are not good enough."
1,Tripe,"Unlike the author's intermediate to advance recommendations, this book really is for the beginner....frankly, even then I would hesitate to recommend it. The title is quite misleading, there is very little modelling, complex or otherwise. The gist of the book is a compendium of plugins with beginner tutorials. Most of this info is readily available on the web from the developers site. The color examples are extremely amateurish and in fact, quite ugly. I suggest Max users to steer far away this. Your money is spent better elsewhere."
1,piece of junk,"Great Neck had a great reputation for fine tools at one time, but this piece of shoddy Chinese-made junk shouldn't be used for anything other than stirring pots of paint. It has almost no relationship to the picture, except it's supposed to be 1/2"". The handle is a bad cross-hatch on the bar, no raised handle area, and so poorly done that I wouldn't trust it with trying to break any nut. It'll just break, period. It's not a tool, it's a toy.A breaker bar needs some integrity, and Great Neck should be ashamed for selling out. No more of its products for me."
2,Sporadic,"The book is an overview of german grammer that has no room for clarification or examples. There is almost no vocabulary, until you get to a dialogue where some people go grocery shopping... my god, they go on and on telling you the names of every vegetable... am I being punished?If you are a serious student of any language you may find yourself rolling your eyes at audio courses that claim to teach you a language in 3 months, 2 hours, or 10 minutes. If you are just dabbling there are phrase books and travel packs with cds for that. If you are serious there is Assimil, Living Language, Berlitz, and Barrons. I found Hugo's -book- to be useful, but the cd is just horrible."
4,An instresting book with a glimse at life in the 1950's,I thought that this book was great. After reading it for school I felt a new appreciation for blacks in the 1950's. I realized what a struggle they went through to be treated like equaels. I was amazed be their determination. Read this book. It is wonderful!
1,The Girl on the Outside: Frodo's next reveiw.,"This book was Okay but it didn't fit my reading needs. I liked the fact that it was set in the era it was but I didn't like the characters much. Overall this book ""is not very good"". The author underdetailed most important things in my opinion. The white girl Sophia can't make up her mind about how she feels about intergration and black people."
4,A thougthful and insightful read!,"This book is about a 22 year old black woman and a 62 year old white man who are the only survivors of a plane wreck and end up on a deserted island together. They endure a lot but finally find themselves drawn together. The ironic part of the story is what happens to their fantasy relationship when they are rescued. The book was kind of wordy but it was pretty well written and enjoyable. I am partial to happy endings, however, this ending will give the reader food for thought."
3,Wow,"I would keep an eye on this products price, i bought a few months ago for $20, not sure why it is so much more expensive now. I wouldnt buy at this price.As for the quality, I've had a decent amount of burn failures, and while i'm not sure if this is a result of my burner or the DVDs, i'd say these are not a bad choice for people wanting DL DVDs"
1,Stay away from Memorex DL,I bought two boxes of 5 each and the success rate was 25%. This is a bad brand for DL. Get Verbatim instead.
4,Great price - they work for me,They work just fine. Lots of backup space!Best price I've found on the internet.
5,These dvd+ dl's work for me.,The 1st dl's that I burned 2 years ago were Memorex (Ritek sourced) and in the ensueing time I've burned about 120 of these and never had even one coaster-I can only assume that a lot of the problems that people have with them are burner related as I use Samsung drives. These are as good as Verbatims in my book. I went back and checked the 1st ones that I burned 2 years ago and they still work perfectly-0% failure rate.
4,"Nice Product, I like it","Nice Product, I like it, All though it is very expensive.. Plus advertisement says it is free shipment on Amazon, but when we place the order it says it is sold my 3rd party so you have to pay for shipment.. That's not the right way to advertise."
1,Not Impressed!,This was my first batch of DVD+R DL I have burned two with my Sony DRU-710A and Nero 6 they both passed Verification but they don't play well at all. Be careful or be safe with Verbatim.
4,Great Disks!,I love these disks! I've had no problems with them at all. This is all I use to write information and copy my movies. I wouldn't use anything else. I don't believe I've ever lost one to a bad burn. Perfect! Highly recommended on my part!
1,Don't Buy!,"Junk. The burn process works fine, but are unreadable afterward. Unless you love collecting coasters, go with Verbatim--I've never had a problem with them."
2,"Cheaper than Ritek, and you get what you pay for","I have two DL burners, an NEC and an HP. I've used hundreds Ritek/Ridata DL discs, and over 3 years, I've generated maybe only dozen coasters. Very low failure rate. But I was feeling a little cheap this time around and went for the Memorex low price. Bad move, because out of the 25 discs, half are coasters, both from my NEC and HP drives. I'm going back to Ritek/Ridata."
1,DVDrs are the junkiest I ever bought,I bought these assuming they would be like all other DVD-Rs and work just fine. Half of them are cracked and a good chunk of them won't let me copy anything to the disc. I get a bad media error on a large portion of them. This has never happened with any other DVD Rs I have bought.
2,Not Compatible with my Dell PCs,"After burning a DVD on my Dell PCs, they were not recognizable in 2 different brand DVD players."
5,Bob Bausch - Master of the Universe,Bob Bausch was my favorite Professor in College. This book is great. I wish the great Chet would come and pay me a visit.Very deep book. Not just a lot of humour. It's full of philosophy and ideas about the way things are.Way to go Bob! Your the man!
2,Double billing on Mapsource by Garmin/Don't upgrade,"I've used Mapsource with two Garmin GPS units for years. It is disappointingly lacking as far as being up to date. Now Garmin has changed it's upgrade process. Due to ""security reasons"", they now charge a $75 fee for EACH Garmin unit's unlock code. For me, that is $150 per upgrade. I have called Garmin to ask about this change in policy and have gotten no good answer for the price change, for me a 100% increase! They obviously do not trust their customers, and therefore penalize those who purchase more than one product from them. I see this as price gouging, but more than that, it shows that they expect their customers to cheat and give the maps away, which would be impossible as one needs an unlock code for each machine. $75 for each unlock code is unreasonable at best. No more upgrades for me. Time to look into the competition. I hope someone else will come out with a competitive product that puts these folks out of business."
3,Garmin rips off customers again,"Bottom line: Do not buy this product to update last years version unless you got a new gps and need a new unlock. You will not get anything new out of it. Garmin's maps are the worst at this kind of stuff. I really cant wait til Google releases full maps for gps units, i know there are mods, but you know what i mean. Someone needs to come in and kick Garmin in it's rear and give it a reality check."
3,"Great Maps, High Price","I received a Garmin eTrex Legend HCx GPS for Christmas (for my Geocaching habit), and I wanted to be able to use it for directions when I travel. For the price of the GPS and this map software, I could have bought a nice TomTom 720 GPS. The Garmin software doesn't seem to allow me to edit for roads that have been closed, but the TomTom does. The most frustrating thing about the software is that Garmin locks it to a single GPS unit. If I upgrade to a newer GPS (or if it breaks), I can't move my $120 maps to it. Grrr."
3,Garmin N.A. maps,The maps are great. There are two things that prevent me from giving the a 5 star rating. First you are only licensed to put this software on one garmin GPS device. That means you would have to buy two copies if you wanted it for your hand held and for your car unit. The second problem is that every few years you have to dish out for a new set of maps.
4,You can find anything...,"BOught this to add onto my Garmin hand held GPS, and it goes into detail as a true street navigator. You can look up and mark any address you want now and put it in your GPS to help you along the way."
2,Garmin a little Greedy,"I like Gramin products very much. Have two GPS's and paid good money for them. I bought this map and I was able to use it with only one GPS. Was planning to update my other GPS but Garmin does not allow its use with more than one, and charges full price to update the other unit. I understand limiting the use but, if you own several GPS you should be able to use your DVD map to update your units."
4,Garmin City Navigator North America NT,"Good product, mostly accurate, though there are a few streets missing. Overall a great purchase!"
1,"Save headaches and cash,buy older mapsouce versions","This is the most difficult confusing software I have ever installed.thereunlock wizard will take you to hell and back with coupon codes,then 25 digit code from garmin,then they ask to input your 8 digit serial numbers from you software and GPS when they are 9 and 10 digit numbers and they tell you if you make a mistake,no refunds,basicly tough luck.if all goes well,you will be given a product key then you must find a regitration code and on and on and on. bottom line is the maps are outdated so save your money,get the exact same features,same maps for half the cost.go buy a older version of map source requiring no unlock codes which installs easy and best yet,city navigator only works on one GPS,older verions work all day on lots of GPS's"
2,rip off,I just bought this soft wear for my for my garmin and its for 2008 now I have to spend 60.00 more for the 2009 update!!!this just sucks!!!
2,I hate paying money for software that should be free,"See title. Also, takes you to ""out only"" gates in gated communities with no indication of where the entrance is. But I had someone tell me Tom-Tom does the same thing. Often give you wierd directions."
3,Look out for excessive copy protection,"Copy/piracy protection for their maps is so obsessive that even their own staff cannot easily circumvent it in the (inevitable) case where copying is necessary. In my own case, I had to replace my 705 with another, but since I had already downloaded my (purchased) North American DVD of maps, I was unable to unlock the map without 3 hours (!) of telephone assistance from technical support. ! This is supposed to be called customer service?? There just has to be a better way..."
4,Map update program better than I expected,Garmin Map Update 2008 City Navigator for North America NT (010-10989-00 and 010-10989-50)As I read the other reviews I expected to have trouble with this program and I did. You must have all info with you and expect to call then for help. The help line was helpful as if they had this type of problems all the time. There software protection is extreme to the point that it will bring in the program hackers. The upgrade worked and my unit is much better than it was. The errors I have seen so far have been small ones. This is a good upgrade for an older unit. Unlock code only good for one unit upgrade. I now have three different Garmin units that I use. With the price of the upgrade (Close to the cost of some new units) and it is only good for one of my units I will be looking into buying a different brand next time.Prof. Gadget
3,Garmin City Navigator NA DVD,The DVD Product is perfect as delivered which is the out of date 2008 version. It was advertised as the Current Map Set with the 2009 Map Set Garmin Part Number. Disappointed in the accuracy and therefore the price.
3,But whatcha going to do,"if it is the only product that works with your Garmin GPS. It took awhile for me to load it onto a 2gig micro SD card (that I got through Amazon) but that was expected. And, I felt that I had to jump through more hoops than necessary to install it but the job got done and I am happy with it.It is not a bad product but it needs updated. When I registered it with with Garmin, they said they were sending me an update disk but it has yet to arrived.I will look closely at the other GPS brands such as Tom Tom or Magellan for the next GPS I buy. I ain't happy with Garmin service and won't order directly from them anymore if I can help it.Amazon has done just great on delivery of stuff I ordered from them so I guess I am spoiled."
3,It's OK. Don't really trust it.,"Bought this to replace an ICF-C760 I've had for 11 years (pressed the ""Alarm A"" button and it just kept going--button inside clock). Had this about a month and in the past 5 days it has not gone off twice. First time, the volume was low somehow. This time no reason. Checked it before I went to sleep and checked it again when I finally woke up--all set properly, right time and volume, and ON. Will return. Trying same model, so we'll see. It is very loud (when it works) and very clear. Will probably go ahead and open up the C760 and get the button out and see what we can do. I need four alarms anyway."
1,Snooze or Off: Goodluck,"I hate this thing. The off button is located so close to the snooze, if you are a snoozer, you will probably mistakenly turn the alarm off if you aren't careful and you will be late for work. This is a major design flaw. I would recommend RCA clock radios."
1,This is NOT an automatic setting clock as described.,This is NOT an automatic setting clock as described. It is PRESET at the factory. I thought it was one that set itself automatically to the atomic clock. This is VERY misleading.
4,Actually is New and Improved!,"I have had a Sony clock radio like this one for many years so when it came time to buy a new one for my husband I went searching for one that was similar and found this one. We were happy to find that they improved on the basic design by having the ability to set two separate alarms, you're also able adjust the brightness of the clock to very low and we like the alarm tone that starts off with an intermittent tone that slowly gets closer and closer together so you don't jump out of your skin when the alarm goes off. I'm thinking that I might have to swap mine out!"
3,It's a decent alarm clock but........,My wife purchased this alarm clock because we have frequent power outages. She thought that it would stay on when the power goes out but it actually doesn't. The clock display goes off with the power but the alarm does still work if it was set. We wanted an alarm clock that would stay completely on when the power goes out but were disappointed to learn that it doesn't.
5,Phenomenal!,This alram clock is extremely easy to use. All of the features are self-explanitory and the directions just make it easier. I have had this alram clock for about two weeks and it works like a charm! The price is extremely worth it!
4,Excellent low cost clock radio.,This clock radio works very well. I like the adjustable display as the display on my previous clock radio was like a spot light even on low. The radio reception is excellent. I live in the hinterland about 70 miles from Austin and yet I can pick up my favorite Austin radio station. I tried an Emerson first from my local Walmart and ended up taking it back because it had terrible reception. It would not receive even the local station.
5,excellent alarm clock,Excellent easy to use alarm clock. Have not used the radio as of yet. However it is quite simple to set alarm times and one can go forward and backwards on the alarm time which is a real convenience.Would recommend the product highly.
3,Nice clock but missing key feature,"The clock is priced extremely well with almost every key feature you could want in an alarm clock. The ability to handle DST automatically, dual alarms, dimmer for the clock, etc. But the lack of a weekend feature is critical to any alarm clock. There is nothing worse than sleeping like the dead on Saturday morning and then BEEP BEEP BEEP at 6am because the alarm clock didn't realize it was Saturday and there was no way to tell the clock other than turning off the clock. Now you are wide awake and can't get back to sleep. Or you do happen to remember to turn off the alarm Friday morning but forget to turn it back on Sunday evening, and you are an hour late for work or for getting the kids up and out the door for school.I spent so much time looking at the automated clock setting features, dual alarm, and dimmer that I missed what I thought was a standard feature these days, especially on a dual alarm clock.Product Returned!"
2,Disappointing,The buzzer alarm is much too low for someone who is hard of hearing like me. My old alarm clock was plenty loud enough but just wore out after 15-20 years.
1,Broke after 4 minutes,"WARNING: if you intend to use this alarm clock with a in Europe/overseas with a converter, it will break! The clock worked for 4 minutes and then never turned on again, even when I plugged it into a US plug. Be aware and don't make the mistake that I made. I guess thats what you get when you purchase something made by Sony."
2,Lasted 11 months,"Bought this product in late July, 2008, and now in late June, 2009, theLED display no longer works with the unit plugged into an outlet."
1,"Automatically, incorrectly changes time","I've been using this clock about a year with only one complaint. Over time, it slowly gets fast. When it is 10 minutes ahead, I reset it. Until this morning, I've had no other complaints.Inexplicably, it changed the time last night. When I went to bed, it was roughly the same time as my husband's clock. This morning, the alarm went of at 6:10 am, when in reality it was only 5:10. I think it adjusted itself for daylight savings.Regardless, I believe an alarm clock has two core functions: to tell time correctly and to wake me at a specified time. This clock does neither."
4,Very nice dual alarm clock/radio - highly recomended,Very nice alarm clock. I love the big numbers and it's very easy to use.
5,Perfect,"This does everything an alarm clock needs to do and does it all well, with a few nice extras. There is no iPod doc and no CD player. So what? Its job is to play music for a few minutes every morning when I wake up. I use the stereo for listening to music during the day.The tuner faithfully pulls in the weak signal of the only Classical station in town. Brightness adjustment is useful. The huge snooze button is clever - one tap snoozes 10 minutes, two taps - 20 minutes, and so on up to 60 minutes. And the alarm stays set every day unless you turn it off... useful for those of us who sometimes forget to set the alarm at night.The ""no power, no problem"" feature appears to have worked during the times that a thunderstorm fritzed the neighborhood grid."
4,Good low cost dual alarm clock,"I would agree with many of the comments made here. The price is right, it's easy to set and use the dual alarms, and the radio is OK. The alarm volume is surprisingly low, even on the 'High' setting compared to other alarm clocks, but this is fine with me. You can always use the radio instead of the alarm and set it to a higher volume.I especially like the variable brightness control of the display and the greenish color, which I prefer to the bright red display of my previous alarm clocks."
4,Yup - it's an alarm clock,Took it out of the box - plugged it in - disabled DST - works great.Radio tunes easily - easy setup of alarm times.
3,not loud enough,"it's not loud enough.radio is not that good, because it doesnt have any kind of an antana. but for a radio w/o an antana its pretty goodyou can see the #s in the dark, but its pale yellow, it would be so much better if the #s were red and much thicker.2 alarms, and easy to set alarmsets the time automatically so that takes care of the hassle of setting the time. its a bit odd shaped, and balky.the snooze button could be bigger."
5,Highly Recommend,"Best alarm clock that I have ever owned and if this breaks, I would not hesitate to purchase this one again. The other reviews covered pretty much all there is to know on this, but like I said, the best I've used. Highly Recommend."
4,Sony ICF-C318 Auto Time Set Clock Radio with dual alarms.,Well I seem to like the little chirping alarm noise it makes. Only once since I purchased it did I miss the first alarm. Not too bad since it fixes itself when the power goes out and doesn't lose your time that you set for the alarm to go off. Some of these types of clock radio lose everything when they lose power. The power seems to go out randomly often for everyone and if I don't notice the clock is wrong I could be late for work. I depend on my clock to wake me when I don't wake myself. I think for the price the look and sounds are pretty good. I would recommend this item... and I actually have to someone else and they like it as well. The numbers are nice and big and it isn't too bright in the bedroom at night time.
2,Good display but inconvenient & not radio controlled,"This clock is easy to read, which I like most about it, but setting the alarm requires more finger acrobatics than I like... hold this while rotating that, press this while holding down that, etc. Be aware that ""automatic time set"" does NOT mean radio controlled. It means the time and date were set at the factory, and a lithium battery keeps time during shipment. When you first plug it in it's already pretty close to the real time, but like any manual clock, you'll need to set it if you want it right."
4,Good alarm clock radio for the buck.,Good alarm clock radio for the buck. Easy on the eyes. Alarm is easy on the ears. Happy with this purchase.
3,Time resets itself incorrectly,I love everything about this clock except it has a minor flaw in our case. Randomly (not on the time change weekend of daylight savings) this clock jumps either ahead or backwards an hour during the night. My husband had been late to work twice since we have had it and got there an hour too early another time. We have to get a new alarm clock but if it worked correctly and didn't do this we would love it.
5,PERFECT !,"Love the dual alarms, the sleep mode, the dimmer, all of it!As expected from Sony. Great product.No more annoying beeping from those generic alarm clocks.:o)"
5,Works well,"This clock works very well. The alarms on this clock are not the loudest in the world, but they work just fine. The dual alarms are set up very easily to use and the alarms are loud enough to wake you but not loud enough to wake the whole house."
5,this product is so useful,"I had the product and I am glad to boughtt it. It is easy to use, comprehensible. Thanks"
4,Perfect for the Price,The Sony ICF-C318 Clock Radio with Dual Alarm is just that. Compact and easy to use. Really like the dimmer capability of the display. Lost electricity for 6 days due to Hurricane Sandy and not only did clock keep working as promised BUT it even knew about daylight savings time. What's not to like? The price was right too!
1,It won't turn off,"For the first month or so everything worked very well. I love how easy it is to set the independent alarms. About a week ago the off button stopped working. The radio will not turn off, even after power cycling the clock. The only way I can sleep is to turn the volume knob all the way down."
1,Nice but breaks,"Had 2 of these, neither lasted longer than 26 months. Alarms failed. Nice, easy to use, but not worth it for 2 years use."
1,No ability to set alarm by day,The clock is fine but without the ability to set weekdays only that means I have to manually turn the alarm on and off. Now I just use it as a clock and use my iPhone as my alarm clock.
1,Not an atomic clock,"This is not an atomic clock. It does not connect to the US Atomic clock that broadcasts the time in Ft. Collins, CO."
1,messed up shipping...Again.,March 4th I orderd the item... March 11 the item was shipped.. In tracking the item it went to Earthcity Mo. on Oct 2009 and was signed for.. From 3/11/11 the tracking shows in transit again. Whats up???
5,Nice wire cutter,Perfect for cutting 18 and 16 guage fence wire. Haven't tried it with anything else.
2,be sure it the type of pen,"The pens do what they claim to do. The construction of the pen is of the type of matterial that when opening the barrel can cross tread while screwing together. Be aware of the shipping costs. I made the misstake of using 1-click. It turned out that shipping costs were 2 times the cost of the product. Even though after complaiming and getting $20, I still paid $35. Beware!"
3,Creative retrospective of Tom Petty's videos,"Tom Petty's music is very good, and his videos are more than that. They are creative, imaginative, well produced. We get spoiled by them. Just think about the rest of the music videos out there. So many of them aren't nearly as creative as these.For me, the biggest drawback about this dvd is that it is a collection of old music videos instead of an experience of Tom Petty. It is like a ""greatest hits"" collection, only for videos instead of songs.I found Cyndi Lauper's live dvd At Last a stronger video. You get the real Cyndi there, living and breathing. A really good live concert is going to be more enjoyable than a retrospective of someone's past videos."
3,I felt this book helped me be in touch with my body more,"I was child abused many years ago, and therefore split offfrom myself quite profoundly. Years of therapy have helped meheal and get back to me and my feelings. The last place toheal has been my lower torso area. Discovering belly dancingis profoundly moving (no pun intended!) and this book helpsput the whole thing into historical and personal perspective.I especially like the part about how the women dance for eachother and bond in feminine ritual and understanding...evenwhen children in the middle east.I think this book is valuable on many levels."
5,Hilarious!,I almost wet my pants at several different parts. I vaguely remember when it aired originally on the History Channel. I'm glad I stumbled upon it.
5,Beautifully executed story of love,"A father's love for his daughter is endless and no better way is this exhibited than in this effective story. Evans, a gifted storyteller, knows how to tug on the heartstrings as well as relate to his audience, be they young or old. This is a story that is timeless and destined to become a classic."
1,This so-called children's book is not really for children,"I found this book rather sentimental and unsubtle, at least too much so for my taste. More importantly, I don't think this book is really for children. I don't think kids will relate to the father's emotion about his daughter, or simply may not perceive it: 'And he was smiling' may not be enough for kids. It doesn't help that the father is never depicted -- makes it harder still to identify with or understand this important character. And once the girl becomes a woman, I'm afraid that kids will feel very separate from her and so again not feel the deep emotion that many adults feel. This author has lots of fans, and many will enjoy the book no matter what, but in my opinion, as a children's book, it's flawed."
1,Bolle - Bolle Sun Glasses,"Item received in good condition. I'm somewhat dissapointed with the quality of the glasses. I know the vendor didn't make them but for the price, I expected better. I would purchase from this vendor again."
5,"If you only buy 1 book on cats, I recommend this one...","This book is wonderful, and would make a great gift. I refer to it constantly. We bought it when we adopted our first kitten, and has helped us with a variety of issues such as feeding, litter box problems, grooming, and travel. With this book in hand, I feel confident that we're giving our cat the best care possible."
2,Kindle version index doesn't work,"It might be a good book, but the ""index"" is merely a list of topics without any links to the content within the book. Very disappointing."
1,"HE WAS BETTER IN ""DA HIP HOP WITCH"" MOVIE","YO! Anyone that has seen this know that is typical of EM. He's cool and the illest out right now...hands down. But yall gotta see him in that Blair Witch spoof called DA HIP HOP WITCH...it is ILL YO!!! He only has like 5 scenes yo but it is off the hook he is crazy!!! Me and my crew just sit back and blaze wit it!!! Also in it is MOBB DEEP, PRAS, KILLAH PRIEST, RAH DIGGA, RAS KASS, JA RULE and check it even VITAMIN C & VANILLA ICE---he and EM in the same flick is ILL!!!! Peace!!!"
3,Corrupt,"I think the DVD is a little thin, It could have had a few more songs on it.I no longer own this DVD, I returned 2 copies of it due to the audio track being corrupt.I gave up in the end and bought a second copy of the Marshall Mathers LP."
5,TDK DVD-R,"I have had good experience with TDK products over the years. These discs are reliable unlike my experience with other brands of DVD-Rs. They work well in recording laser discs, VHS cassettes, and other applications.I have recently experienced complete failure with 100 discs of another brand, much to my dismay."
1,Won't burn at 16x--or 8x--or 4x...,"I have a Plextor DVD writer which never has any trouble writing to generic store-bought DVD-R or DVD+R blanks at the fastest-rated speed--yet these from TDK won't burn at any speed above 2x. Attempts with a higher rate result in erratic failure (sometimes at 20%, or 10%; or sometimes at 99%!). More than half a dozen wasted blanks later I'd ruled out all other factors; disappointing for a well-touted brand like TDK but they *ARE* cheap blanks. btw the media/manufacturer ID is TTH02"
5,They work like they should,but unfortunately they have a major downfall.They don't taste very good.I would say get these but only if you have some salt and pepper!
5,A beautiful tragedy,"Trevor's writing style is simple, beautiful and powerful as he portrays his characters thoughts and actions in a way that makes you care for each of them, however horrible their actions may be."
5,Horse Book,I purchased this great & informative & interesting book among other horse items for a 12 year old girl for Christmas!! She rides horses a lot & has 6 at her home!! She really enjoyed this book & the other items a lot!!:)
5,An excellent Cold War story.,"""Ten Nights of the Beast"" is an excellent portrayal of Cold War tensions from a comics standpoint.The Beast was particularly well-characterized, achillingly fanatic character who will stop at nothing to accomplish his goals. In addition, the corruption of some of the U.S. officials adds a touchof realism. Overall, a very good book, one that Iwould recommend to any Batman fan."
2,Mediocre at best,"I read the recently released second edition in hopes of finding a good general history of capitalism. Regrettably I didn't find it here. Frankly this text fails to rise to the level of a general textbook. For example, the author somehow manages to sum up the English enclosure acts, Cromwellian revolution, 1688 and the French Revolution in around five pages with a brief stopover into French absolutism in the mix!There is little in the way of recent scholarship here. I also get the feeling that the translation leaves something to be desired.The author sums it up best himself in the preface to the second editon. Looking back at his authorship he writes, ""I was forty-three. I was not worried about the scientific authority-figures of my discipline, nor the reactions of my colleagues, nor my own abilities... now, twenty or more years later, I am no longer sure I would take it on again.""A much better choice is The Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View by Ellen Meiksins Wood (Verso Press)."
2,"So-so.....bad, but could be worse.","Caught this on NetFlix. It's not the worst thing in the world, but some of the effects are pretty cheesy, even for B-type sci-fi movies. The initial meteor hit contaminating ground water miles away nearly instantly? Uh...just how did that happen? Nobody hears of how to distill water to purify? Nobody has reverse osmosis purifiers? Even a puddle is contaminated? Ummm....junk science entirely. Bad acting, typical great shot bad guys and terrible shot good guys. Always just one gun, nobody ever picks up the guns from the dead bad guys and somehow this all ends up (of course) in LA. Is that so they could keep the budget even lower? Oh well...could be worse. Don't pay a lot for this one...better to find it free at the library or catch it on Netflix."
3,brainless and a little sleazy,"This book is good brainless, pass the time reading but be prepared for the racey parts."
5,Good ideas,A general how-to-do-it book which contains a very detailed walkthrough of the whole process presented in a friendly style. The authors encourage the keeping of careful records and suggest the use of a master spreadsheet to show file organization and naming conventions.
4,Good Introduction To One Of California's Icons,"The Missions of California is an excellent introduction for anyone wishing to begin their study of these California historical icons. Yenne gives the reader a nice overview of each mission's history as well as the history of the entire mission chain. While the format (founding, agricultural statistics, unique personality at the mission, decline, restoration) does become a little tiring when stretched over 21 missions, the pictures more than make up for any discomfort the repetition causes. All in all, The Missions of California would make an informative, attractive addition to any coffee table."
3,Soft carrying case for Montague folding bicycle,"The Montague soft carrying case does everything it is supposed to do. I have the Paratrooper Pro, and it fits right in, with the extra separate slot for the front wheel. I've used it maybe five times and it works well for toting the bike around, into restaurants etc. However, on the last big trip I took with the Montague, folded and packed, on Amtrak, I did not use this soft carrying case. Instead I used a carrying case for a massage table. It is of equivilent size, has the straps etc., and is made of a thicker more robust material. Also the Montague bag has the SwissBike emblem emblazoned on one side, where the table bag did not, so I considered it less likely to be an advertisement to a thief. And a massage table bag is $60 to $90.The Montague bag is fine, just maybe consider that there are other options."
5,Fun Party Game,"The Great Dalmuti is by far one of our favorite games to play with firends. To really enjoy the game, our friends get into their class role. The Dalmuti loves to make decrees like the Greater Peon can't talk during the round. You can't be too mean because your luck can turn on you in an instant. We even bought a crown for the Dalmuti to wear. It's a really fun game."
4,Fun and social impact,"This is a great game for pre-teens and tweens. The point of the game is that life is not fair - you are assigned a position that automatically makes it easier or harder for you to win (peasant - king/Great Dalmuti). If you are a peasant, you have to work extra hard to win the game, but the Great Dalmuti as all the advantages. While the game is somewhat repetitious for adults, kids love it. We always choose crazy hats to identify each character and as someone moves up or down in the pecking order, they exchange hats. It is fun for the kids, and can be the opening point for valuable discussions on how some people are born with or without certain privileges."
5,A Great Game to Play With Friends!!,"I first played this game with some friends on vacation and I ordered it for myself as soon as I got home! My friends and family love it...especially playing up the roles (i.e. getting drinks for the Great Dalmuti, etc.). It is a great blend of strategy and luck. You can't help the cards you are dealt, but sometimes what you think is the worst hand ends up being the best if you can play the cards right."
4,Great textbook,"This textbook cotains subjects that are above most undergradute courses, for it presents advanced content that is often ommitted. This particular edition lacks the answers to end-of-chapter problems, hence the 4 stars."
5,GR8 book for the NOVICE,"This book is one of the best I have ever read for all my courses I had in my ME curriculum.Heat transfer is a very interesting phenomena and I didnt know about it till I was introduced to this courses. All the various modes of heat transfer-conduction,convection and radiation give you a better insight about normal day physics, I shud say.....As far as the book is concerned, its great in fact its written by one of our Professor's Dewitt here at Purdue.. Yeah but he doenst teach anymore too bad:(enjoy this subject!"
2,not sure about carryover,"this is an old-time structured lesson set, with slogans and (I thnk) dumb activities and artwork. I don't find it very helpful, especially for individual work. I can't imagine it does much more than nominally meet some requirement for addressing social skills for a whole-class presentation. You get what you pay for."
1,"weak, not good for espresso","First of all, on opening the bag, the beans were light brown and dry, no great aromas. I have tried to like it, but it makes horrible espresso drinks (no crema, tastes like weak cheap coffee). I will go back to San Francisco dark roast for my daily espresso drinks fix. Even though I paid over $20 for the bag, I cannot drink it."
3,Good coffee,The coffee is good.. the price is horrendous. Never again will I pay that much money for a coffee that is almost as good as Dunkin Donuts brand.
3,Average,"I expected a lot from these beans after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon. I expected a rich, flavorful espresso bean. These beans appear to be under roasted. They are very light in appearance and don't have any of the customary oil that I find thinly coating other quality coffee beans. I still gave them a try, and the resulting brew did taste better than expected, but was nothing to write home about. They do make a very nice cup of regular coffee if ground using the 'course' setting of my bur grinder. I've decided to just use them for coffee as they make a pleasing cup of moderately strong coffee if you use enough beans. I use approximately twice as many beans as I do with the 100% Kona that is my usual bean to get coffee that tastes substantial. These beans also cost half as much as the Kono beans do, so I guess that's tolerable.I would not recommend these for Espresso. For normal coffee they're fine, but still not in any way remarkable."
3,This Was OK,"But maybe a little disappointing. Frankly I got better crema and aroma from ""Super Crema"" and ""Pienaroma"" beans, to which I'll probably go back. The flavor is pretty mild.I'm using the beans in a Rancilio Rocky grinder and Silvia espresso machine."
2,Just Can't Make Myself Like It,"Like another reviewer, I've been on a search for a less expensive coffee to replace my Starbucks addiction. This one doesn't even come close... seems weak no matter how much I use per cup. Tastes like bad coffee at a roadside cafe. If you are a fan of Starbucks or Illy, look elsewhere as this will be a big disappointment to you."
2,Not the best coffee...,I was expecting a tastier coffee. This one is kinda flat and I just can't drink it as is. It's quite better when blended with a real dark roast coffee.
5,great coffe,"I was not much of a coffee drinker, but my husband brought this home and I am hooked. I love, love, love this coffee."
4,Memoir Writing Prompts,"""Your Autobiograpy"" by Ray MungoI was delighted to find Ray Mungo's out-of-print memoir-writing book through Amazon's used book dealers.I'd used his prompts frequently several years ago and then lent it to a non-returning colleague.What I liked about his prompts was the variety -- suggesting the juicy details,then pulling back to the philosophical questions about our lives as we've lived them.This approach encourages us to include the events, issues and detailsthat will make our writing sparkle with interesting characters and texturesthat create the fabric of life. Now Ray Mungo is back in my library,ready to help me with the ""career"" chapters that represent countlesshours and years of living, yet are absent in my story.No more procrastination! No more excuses! Hit the computer and type the words!"
5,Two great tools,"I use the DaVinci Tool when my rhomboids flare up. I place it up under my shoulder blade and it stretches the muscles giving me relief. The Body Back Buddy is my swiss army knife for trigger points. Normally, I can get my pain level to reduce by 2-3 on the 1-10 scale with 10 minutes using either tool."
3,Bluefinch,"Terrific, but more word combinations would have made this of greater interest and a larger vocabulary to make this a better buy. It would be more useful if more of the most common words inGreek were included."
3,Not a good message,"My 4-year old loves Spongebob, so, I thought this would be a good item to get him since he is starting school. When I read the message on the backpack, I didn't feel that it was appropriate for an educational item and I don't want him getting the wrong message. I will be returning it."
2,Good but.........,"Andre Rieu is always excellent in music and this DVD reafirms this. But this time his selection of titles is too much out of his usual. That can be good or not. As long as many people enjoy it, that is good, that's what Andre is about. Although, I can understand the lower ratings some people have given this DVD. I too, believe this isn't measuring up at all to ""The Homecoming"" or ""100 years of Straus"". I will confess, if I saw this ahead of time I wouldn't have boughten it. It seems Andre is too concerned with 'theatrics' and is vearing to much from his 'gift' of music. This is too much like as circus show. Can't blame Andre for reaching out on occasion, hopfully he comes back to his 'forte'."
2,less than stellar,This theme of this DVD does not live up to the standard set with the dvd's created at the Royal Albert Hall or The Homecoming. The music as always is excellent but I was able to turn this DVD off about halfway through while the previous seven that I have purchased continue until the last note is heard.
1,Great Andre,I like andre rieu's music I think he is very creative but performance in wonderland does not reflect his true creativity.
3,Hard Working Heroine,"Hilary De Vries is a very clever and always readable author, but So 5 Minutes Ago, DeVries first novel about Alex Davidson, was a much easier read than The Gift Bag Chronicles. There is a very pervasive sense of exhaustion in this novel, and I'm not sure it's entirely attributable to the heroine's insanely demanding job. In this book, the love found at the end of So 5 Minutes Ago turns to dust and ashes, in order that a new love can be found, but the whole thing feels a little contrived and made-to-order. It would have been interesting to see Alex grow up within a relationship, instead of having the formulaic chick lit ""the guy you really ought to be with is right under your nose"" revelation. Something about this book just felt like hard work. (Which will in no way affect me rushing out to buy Book #3, if and when it appears!)"
3,So-so... nothing special,"Hilary De Vries's ""The Gift Bag Chronicles,"" centered around Alex, a publicist working in Los Angeles who had to deal with the endless demands of the rich and famous. She was also dating her agency's president, Charles who was based in New York. Their relationship was an unconventional one as they rarely saw each other. Basically, Alex's life was centered around her work and she did not have much personal time for herself.This is yet another book that takes a look at the glitz and glamour of Hollywood parties. It is not much different from books such as ""Everyone Worth Knowing,"" ""The Twins of Tribeca"" or ""The Perfect Manhattan."" It's all basically about slaving and dealing with the difficult rich people. This is an okay book with not much of character development, and the author focuses solely on Alex's career. It's basically an okay read."
1,More pronography then medical guidance,"While certain anatomical photos are certainly necessary to help explain birth, this book goes way beyond medical visuals and seems to have gone out of its way to include pictures that border on pornography. There's even diagrams that were amended to include ""details"" clearly not necessary to serve as an effective visual aid. Moreover, why it is necessary to have so many waistup shots of women's breasts and pretty blatnat ones to boot when a baby comes out of the body waist below is beyond on us. We tried at first to ignore the pictures and read the book, but it just got so obscenre for us, we shelved it with plans to throw it away. Men buying Penthouse will definitely like this book!"
1,"DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM TRUE VALUE, THEY CANCEL YOUR ORDER",i PLACED AN ORDER WITH THEM OVER A WEEK AGO AND JUST NOW GOT NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAD CANCELLED MY ORDER WITH no EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER!
5,"A fantastic, romantic story that took my breath away!","I've read Ms Higdon's other books, and this one certainly didn't disappoint me either! I'm a fan of the Regency period anyway, but get frustrated when I read glaring errors or characters behaving like they'd never do in real life. It quickly became obvious to me that this book is well-researched, the characters come alive, and I got fully involved in not only the compelling love story, but the secondary characters' lives. Once I started reading, I didn't want to stop!Kudos to Ms Higdon for a fantastic, romantic story that took my breath away!"
3,"It's gross, but funny","My grandpa gave me this book when I was growing up and I thought it was the most disgusting and funny book I had ever read. Now that my niece is old enough to enjoy it, I regret ever getting rid of the book. It's great for boys and girls with that nasty, gross sense of humour."
3,The character had issues and so did this book,"I was excited to see the author take on the identity crisis issue faced by so many African American's in Eurocentric institutional structure, such as higher education, corporate America and sometimes within our own communities. However, I was highly disappointed that the structure of the novel was like a jig saw puzzle. As a result, I never felt that the sistah reached a turning point or developed. Then again, may be some of us don't and that was the author's point."
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"I would not recommend this book. It is filled with cliches and moves slowly. It is also poorly written. The author has potential and the storyline is a good concept, but the vocabulary and her writing style needs improvement. If you want a book that keeps you in suspense and flows nicely, pass over this one!"
4,A decor book for the artist within,"As professional home stylist and a lover of all things creative, I purchased this book. I was afraid it was going to be all cutesy country but it was not. It does have a lot of vintage items in great vignettes but is also has chapters on ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" - ethnic decor, and a chapter entitled ""The bare necessities""- which expounds on the ""less is more"" look. If you want a home that says, ""An artist lives here""; this book will give you great ideas and inspiration. This book is now one of my favorites in my extensive decorating book collection."
5,This book has been with me for years and I still love it!,"As an artist the decoration styles presented in this and other Mary's books and magazines appeals to me more than any other,the nick nacks' in every room are always being rediscovered every time I'm headed to a fair, garage or state sale, an antique or thrift store, I always go back to ""my book"", before I head out. I get inspiration to create my own art, and since I can't make up my mind on a decor style: ""country"", ""traditional"", ""cottage"", ""funky"", etc. I learned I can mix them all! And still keep my favorite things and colors all together."
3,Ok,"Nice and thick. However, I thought it was going to be much bigger and more of a body pillow. Its only about 10 inches in widh so you cant really lay on it."
2,Very thick for a child and no cover included,"I purchased this for my 4-year-old. Granted, he's not a ""teen,"" but this is a very thick pillow, and not mushy enough. I assumed that the ""white"" in the description meant a white cover, since who cares about the color of the uncovered pillow? Not the best purchase."
1,YUCK!,"I read so many great reviews about Jill Mansell that I thought I would try this novel. How horrible. The characters are flat and annoying. The humor fell extremely short for me. I found myself reading and thinking ""Can someone really be this stupid?"" Set in England, and I lived there for three years, I never found people as stupid as the characters portrayed. Do not waste your money or time. I rely on reviewers to form an opinion on items I want to purchase and I can not believe the great reviews this received. Definitely was extremely disappointing."
5,A hilarious and exciting book for readers of any age,"I am only 14 years old, yet I found this book as fast-moving and funny as my mum did. I simply couldn't put it down, and the relationships and predicaments of the characters only added to its appeal. I have also read 'Head Over Heels', 'Miranda's Big Mistake' and 'Good At Games', and found them as light-hearted and amusing as 'Perfect Timing'. I would recommend any of Jill Mansell's novels to readers of any age, as the hilarious plot-lines and surprising twists will keep everyone laughing and guessing until the end. A great book."
3,No support for problems with Pinball machine,"I received the Pinball machine with 1 flipper not working. There wasno number to contact for issues and I finally found an email address of the company which basically said I was on my own. Thank goodness the issue was simple to fix but if there was anything more significant, I would have been out of $300."
4,Great Intro for Undergrads!,"If you're interested in learning more about Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy, then this is a really good book to start out. The critical/introspective reader will see certain flaws in the execution of REBT theory on actual people. Seeing as how this isn't a Therapy and Counselling course, i'll leave that to you to figure out. The book was written in a very easy to understand style. The Wesslers covered a variety of central issues regarding the practice of of REBT. You will not feel shortchanged when you put down this book."
4,Cheap fun,"If you REALLY hate squirrels, and don't want to waste any of your precious 22LR ammo, this is the tool for you! After getting used to the trajectory, it's pretty accurate, and quite powerful. The stabilizers place the center balance point right in the middle of your hand and help to keep your draw in the same spot every time. By doing the slingbow mod (as seen on YouTube by Dave Canterbury), this is turned into a small to medium game hunting weapon, and is very effective.Highly recommended for a bit of fun, or a light backpacking hunt!"
3,Gift Tee,I bought this shirt as a gift for a friend of mine. The processing and shipping was very prompt and my friend really loves the shirt.
1,Don't waste your time,"Nevens needs to learn that there is a BIG difference between freedom of speech and the freedom to teach. In this boring video (I only got through about 10 minutes)Nevens tries to pollute the minds of minors in high school with his anti-war rhetoric and other such nonsense. College, maybe? Public high school? Not to minor children and not on my tax dollar. He was a draft dodger during the Vietnam War (look it up) and has no right being a public school teacher period in my opinion. No stars for this trash from me!"
1,Disappointed,"I sure expected more! This DVD would have been totally worthless if it hadn't been for the dated video footage. I at least got to see things not seen online. Substative content was missing. No detailed information what so ever was provided. Instead, broad strokes over the countries highlights as if they were trying to sell you a cruise vacation.I would have like to learn something about day to day life from real people that have relocated to the Costa RIca. I would have liked to hear about some of the challenges expats experience. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,terrific,"I wondered if I would be pleased with a book rated ""used - acceptable"" but I took a chance. It is almost like new."
5,An outstanding series of journeys to higher spiritual realms,"Peter Ferrucci enriches Roberto Assagioli's Psychosynthesis and gives many gentle step-by-step guided journeys and meditations that assist the reader to experience the vast love and unlimited knowledge of the soul.In this classic book Mr. Ferruci reveals his highly creative artistry with words that inspire. Using his excellence as a trained psychologist and spiritual leader, he has produced a very fine synthesis of transforming one's personality through spiritual contact. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is awakening to the spiritual world."
5,Woefully overlooked. An incredible work!,"Sometimes the ""little"" films pack a heck of a wollop.This is a perfect example of how a quiet, little film, withlow-profile actors, a sweet subtle score, and deft directing can knockthe emotional wind out of you.This is a very sad, funny, tragic, and joyous film ... all at one time! As one of the other reviewers put it, this isn't a film about two Beautiful people (with a capital ""B""), but rather, about you and me. These are ordinary people trying to make the best lives that they can.And it's extremely funny, and touching, and in the end, touched with joy and grief.I can't recommend this movie strongly enough. Buy it. If you can't, then borrow it. Bribe a friend to show it to you. Do what you can to see it! END"
2,"Truly, Madly for Alan","In a movie categorized as a romance, there's little of it for Alan Rickman fans. He plays 'Jamie' the ghost of a lover from a grieving woman, 'Nina' (played by Juliet Stevenson). The title should have the word 'Sadly' in it, because her character is in every scene. Alan sings, using a cello as a guitar, which is the highlight of this bore of a movie, which spends too much time on men ranting about 'Nina', and the viewer is painstakingly put through scenes of Stevenson wildly dancing all over the set as though she needs to be tied down and heavily sedated. Alan won a BAFTA award, but truly could have found a better vehicle for his talent. Thank you for doing it anyway, Alan. And I don't care what anyone says, your moustached lips or shaven are welcome here."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"So the NYT suggested that this was a good movie. It is sort of a different take on ""ghost"". I could not rent it on Netflix, so I bought it. It was OK, but truthfully, I watched it once, and that is enough. I usually watch movies I like many times. Enough Said."
3,"Truly, Madly, Deeply DVD","The product was listed as ""like new"", but was a far cry from like new. The cover has stains and is dirty, and the DVD distorted to thousands of boxes at the end. I wiped it off and is now clear, but ""like new"" was rhetoric, and not true."
5,Please re-release this movie,This is one of the *best* movies and should be re-released. I keep on hoping it will. Let's keep on pushing.
4,Fun for collectors and lovers of the show.,"This Moon Rod ""Moon Sceptre"" looks a lot like the one on the show excpet that some of the colors are wrong. The sphere in the middle should be red and the staff shouldn't be such a bright pink. You will probably have fun with this for a few days though. I found that it is a lot more fun if you have the other wands Sailor Moon has during the other seasons. You should't play too hard with it because it can break easily. All in all it is a fun toy that you might want to play with on and off again and maybe watch the show and act like Sailor Moon when she uses it. :)"
5,Just right,Just what I ordered compact to fit in the area I had planned and just right for my visiting granddaughter
3,"Agree with all pros, however...there's a hidden con!","If you felt that this was a bargain because of its conversion ability, think again! The conversion rails arent cheap and you can get a toddler bed for less than the price of rails and mattress, keeping in mind that the next conversion stage for this crib is a twin/full size bed. So, space saving has to be re-considered as well. Just good to be aware of all of the facts that come up down the line.DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit- Espresso"
5,Perfect!!,"This was just what I was looking for! I wanted a safer alternative to the traditional bassinet (bassinets are not held to the same safety standards that baby cribs are) for our bedroom. This crib is very sturdy, meets all the same safety standards as a full sized crib, and is just beautiful to boot! It arrived in perfect condition and it took my husband and my father about 45 minutes to assemble. Very happy with this purchase! Just a tip, you'll want to purchase an additional mini crib mattress as the one that comes with it is really just a very thin pad.. And sheets can be difficult to find in stores, but I was very happy with the ABC chenille mini crib sheet purchased on amazon for our 3 inch mini crib mattress."
3,nearly good,the shaft and chuck is off by a bit so it is pretty useless for most work. I think I just got a faulty one. I will have to get a new chuck and turn the shaft and plate into shape. The gears also grind a bit but Im sure it can be adjusted with some effort. I still think it will work well after these problems are sorted out. Well made and worth the money if you get one without these problems.
5,Best price in town!,Obsession is Obsession but the price that I got on the Amazon site is the best in town! Far cheaper than the mall discount stores or even the internet discount stores!
5,Nice perfume..,Obsession is my preferred perfume as it is somewhere between mild and strong. Price is good at Amazon Merchants (Including shipping) and this is my second purchase. Thanks..
5,Very Impressive!,Obsession's spicy 'n musky scent lasts longer and smells great for daytime wear! My family loves this fragrance and makes me feel real good about it. Great Perfume... Better Bargain... Fast Delivery! What more could be expected? :)
5,Calvin Klien - obsession,This product was a gift for my nephew. He lives with his uncle and has been known snitch from him. Good product. Good delivery. No problems.
5,Great price for a great product,"I buy ""Obsession"" for my husband once a year. This is the best price I have found anywhere for the 4 ounce spray. It was mailed out promptly and I received it in perfect condition. I would buy this product again!"
2,skip this one it only scratches the surface.,"I recently started working on several projects that require the Apache Commons libraries. After looking at several books I chose this one. This is a choice I regret.This book has been at my work desk now for a several months, and several times needed to look something up in it - doing a multi-part HTTP POST to send large files, for example. In every case, it was useless. Sometimes it didn't even have the needed classes in the appendix. This book has only the most introductory material that you could learn from a website in an hour. Except for the most basic questions, or for the complete novices this book is useless. I'd throw it away if I hadn't spent so much money on it.I gave it two stars, only because someone (a novice) might find it helpful, and it does have complete examples. More advanced programmers should skip this one."
4,Its A Great Tool But The Black Rubs Off Easy,"Ok first of all its a leatherman so it kicks a**! the wave is a solid medium heavy duty multi tool with excellent features and options. the blades, scissors and file are sharp out of the box. the molle sheath is very solid and thick. the velcro closure is strong and the pouch has a drain hole as well. I would not hesitate to recommend this tool to anyone. The reason i did not give it 5 stars is this:1. The tool is pretty tight out of the box, you have to lube it and work it for awhile (minor)2. The black is like spray paint, it comes off on your hands, so you have to wipe it down. but then the metal starts to slightly show thru. they should have used a baked enamel or something, not spray paint. it still stays basically black though."
4,Very Bad Customer Service,"This is a very good product used by many in the military as a standard tool. BUT DO NOT BUY IT FROM ELECTRONICA DIRECT.I ordered this Leatherman Multi tool for my son's birthday and had it shipped to him. The product he recieved was used, not new.Because the order was fulfilled by Amazon, the only relief Amazon could offer was a full refund. Amazon customer service was very helpful.However, because I wanted a new replacement, not a refund, I contacted the seller Electronica Direct. I explained the problem to the customer service agent who answered after I navigated the automated phone system. The customer service representative was courteous but evasive about what Electronica Direct could do about the problem. I asked the customer service representative, ""So you intend to do nothing about the problem?"" She answered, ""Yes"". I deemed this answer unacceptable.I recommend that you avoid doing business with Electronica Direct."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"We received this unit as an Xmas gift, but I doubt we'll be getting much use out of it. It seems to have some pretty serious design flaws:1. It takes about 20 minutes2. To make 3-4 servings of ice cream3. Which have to be dispensed within a very short window between ""too soft"" and ""too hard""4. It takes 24 hours to freeze the tub between uses5. And it takes at least 20 minutes to clean all the parts afterward, particularly the main mixer blades -- which are not machine washable!6. Last, it's too tall to fit under the kitchen cabinets, and too bulky to be easily stored away.If someone brought me this machine for an evaluation before deciding whether to market it or not, I would have told them to keep working on the design some more."
1,worst product,"After following the recommendations left by others ie leaving the frozen bowl in the back of a freezer for 48 hours, refrigerating the ingredients, trying more then twice my dissapointed children including myself found that it just turned the liquid into colder liquid."
1,Big disappointment,"After several attempts to make the ice cream, I finally left it in the freezer for a few days to get completely frozen. Then it didn't make the soft ice cream and I had to scoop it out to eat it. Waste of money for suc a fancy doo-dad. Should only buy the ice cream maker and forget the extra fancy stuff. think I'll sell it in a yard sale since it's too late to return it."
3,Fun home soft serve machine,"This is a fun machine to have for a kid's party or for a small dinner party. It makes 10 half-cup servings, with delivery somewhat slow but adequate. I think I'll get more use out of this than my ice cream maker."
5,seraklis Boston MA,"LOVE THIS!!! I have a 6 yr old and a 3 yr old little boys, Santa brought this to them and what a hit. We just made our first batch and easy, easy, easy. Yum. Cleanup was as easy as making. This is family friendly and I can't wait to try out different flavors. My husband ate more of the ice cream than my boys.I guess if I had a complaint, if you could call it that, is that it's only 1 1/2 quarts and there is only 1 freezer bowl. I highly recommend this product and I will definitely look at cuisinart upgrades when we're ready; for now we are going to enjoy this and our ice cream...."
4,"If you want to enjoy an evening with your friends or daytime with your kids, get a ice cream maker by Cuisinart. It's wonderful.","This makes the ice cream very good but it does take a bit longer than the recipe says. I love it, it is fun to work with, easy to do, I had friends over & to stop a dull eve I pulled out my ice cream maker & everyone found it facinating, we all would check the ice cream & had a lot of fun doing it. I have purchased my 3 grandchildren & 1 daughter with this ice cream maker , each one loves it & enjoys making the ice cream."
3,Hard to make this work as it should...,"Still trying to figure out how to make this machine work as it should. A lot os dinging around. Turning the freezer temp colder and refrigerating the ice cream mix helped a little. Finally just partially froze the mix and it did finish making the soft serve, but, the soft serve then had a lot of ice crystals in it which made it more slightly crunchy than creamy. The kids sure didn't mind though! Just a lot more work for me than I thought it might be. Still experimenting....think it might just be a process I need to discover."
2,Poor performance,"This item is highly overpriced for what it does. It is nothing more than an electric ice cream maker in a fancy container made to look like a soft serve machine; and a soft serve machine is not what it is. It will only serve from the bottom pull handle, like a soft serve machine, if the mix is very runny.In order to use this maker, you have to first freeze the bowl, which is the ONLY source for making the soft serve/ice cream. If your mix is at room temperature, or if the room ambient temp is too warm, it won't work; you'll only get a somewhat slushy product. Serving size is also very small. Don't expect to entertain more than 2 or 3 people before needing to refreeze the bowl for another 24 hours.For the price we paid of almost $90, I would have expected much more; such as a built in freezer or chiller unit to assist in the making process. It is virtually non-functionally for my family or me. I will be returning it."
1,Do Not Buy this !!!,"It's a Freeze bowl machine!!! which requires you to freeze the bowl in the freezer for hours and then it barely makes nothing more than sweet cold milk.... Do not buy!!! It's really hard to return the product also...I don't have a lot of time to figure out the return process. So, I'll just eat the 89 dollars. But you guys save your money!!! I don't know how to give it zero star that's why I gave it a single star."
3,gets easier to use each time,"I got this product for Christmas from my mom. i kept it in the box for a loong time and forgot about it, but let me tell you get it out and use it. This thing is amazing! the only con is that it has to sit in the freezer for a long time before each use. A word of advice just keep a spot in the freezer just for it and keep it in their always so when ur ready to use it. It will also be cooled. Cuisinart has some amazing recipes for this product. They also have fat free and no calorie recipes for those of you who are on a diet. the sorbert is definetally the best of all. Sometimes te cones in the holder fall, but not very oten. Just to warn you, the icecream might not turn out so good the first time. So, thats why you go and read the booklet and you will learn everything it can offer wiht this product. It holds a good amount for the price."
1,Not good,It is burned on first time i usen i dont know what. I doThe power of electricity it is Different then USA
3,Delicious but very soft ice cream.,"We have tried this a couple of times, and have found the ice cream to be very soft. We haven't found that the mix-ins add much. However, the automatic feature of this ice cream maker is very nice. It is easy to use, and relatively easy to clean."
5,so far so great!,"This is a GREAT product. I would seriously recommend investing in this for summer days or sleepovers... Makes delicious, fresh ice-cream with great consistency.Mix-it ins have to be really small in order to come out in the ice-cream. normal size chocolate chips won't work.Makes a good amount of ice-cream and the extras can be frozen into equally delicious hard ice cream!Its amazing how just milk, sugar, cream, and vanilla extract can turn into yummy ice cream in such a short period of time"
1,unhappy customer,"Where to start.... oh yeah perhaps the very small fact that I only received one item and not the 10 promised to me. Dealing with TigerDirect was a nightmare. I was on the phone for an hour and did not receive any satisfaction. I actually ended up sending the item (yes the 1 item) back at my own expense. In addition to the disappointment of not receiving the items that I ordered, this vendor charded almost six bucks for shipping this one 8 ounce item. For that price God had better arrive at my door with the product and my free pass to heaven. I will be notifying my local Chamber of Commerce and better Business Bureau of this company's inability to honor it's end of the agreement."
4,It's not the CD,"I absolutely loved the CD Peace on Earth. One of my all time favorite holiday CD's in fact. However, none of the other reviews gave the whole picture of what I was getting.I was quite surprised when I first watched the DVD and realized there would be no performance footage. There were some really nice still shots of footage that appeared to be Colorado ""ish"" in the winter time. Somehow, this really should have been mentioned. Also I admit to be disappointed that Great Spirit was not included in this collection.I still love the music, but this DVD is basically a ""video fireplace"" to have on the big screen during the holiday season. I still give it 4 stars becuse it is the best of its kind. I got this DVD on Amazon marketplace for $7.20. Had I paid full price, I probably wouldn't have been as generous with the number of stars."
5,It's totally sweeeet,"LOTR trivial pursuit is just as good as it sounds. Anyone who considers themselves huge fans of the movies will enjoy this game. The nerdier you are the more you'll like it. The dvd's, however, are really only impressive from a visual standpoint. The questions are a little too easy and don't seem to get harder as you go on, like they're supposed to. The cards are mixed with easy and more difficult questions. All in all, LOTR trivial pursuit is definitely a must have for any fan."
2,Not Much Fun,"I had high hopes for this game, but unfortunately, this product is average at best. The use of the DVD's slow the game and the questions are limited on how many times you land on a wedge before it stops giving questions and tells you to just ask from the deck.Also the questions are lame, What faze of the moon was it when Golum climbed down the cliff in Eming Mul' (sp?), What color was someone dress in a particular scene, How many days did Gimili, Aragon, and Legolas track the Hobbits? Who cares, and the questions on movie making are even worse, really."
3,storage,"Good for storage, but overpriced. Also unit is unstable with rounded bottom edgees - I had to mount boards to the feet to make it more stable."
2,Modifications befrore construction!,"I love the idea of this item, as I already have one in my son's room. I thought having one in my Daughters room would help her learn to organize her toys. The problem that I have with it is that four of the dowels are one length and the other four are a different length...makes it impossible to put it together without cutting the longer dowels with a skill saw. My daughter's birthday was on Valentines day and this was a gift. The frame is half constructed and sitting in the corner waiting for modifications. Disappointing!!!"
4,Whitmor Kids Bin Organizer,I got this for my 4 year old daughter to store all her toys in. We assembled it together and decided which toys to place in the bins. She loves the organizer and mommy loves the organization! Great item.
3,We all reviewed the wrong video!,"""Craw into my Parlour - The art of Killing"" is about bugs. All reviewers thought it was ""BUDO, The Art of Killing"". I have not seen this video and neither have the other reviewers."
1,Disappointed,"In a nutshell, I got more out of the docs available on apache.org.I read the first 4 or 5 chapters, and then even skipped ahead to the chapter on debugging, to see if a later chapter might leave a better impression... To no avail...I found myself so frustrated by the lack of depth and, most importantly, lack of examples and poor writing, that I gave up on it.I simply cannot recommend this book."
3,Forerunner to THE OMEN,"This is a British movie that came out a year before THE OMEN. Like that movie, there is a baby that is possessed by evil. This baby also begins killing everyone around it in stealth, or at least attacking them. This movie was made with a zilcho budget, probably the most expensive part was hiring Joan Collins. It's worth it just to see some gratuitous shots of her mostly naked. Donald Pleasance also stars and does a good job as a doctor, and then he too is killed by the demon child. No great action scenes or fancy special effects but the film does have couple of bloody horror moments."
3,civilization 3,Shipping was extremly fast & product arrived in good shape. I wish I had asked some questions from the seller as I was looking for Civ 3 that had 3 discs not 2. MY fault. Otherwise very happy
3,Please show me somthing differrent,"The Gameplay will be fun for rookies, but for the vetrans Empire Eatrth. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!1"
3,Civ III,I was able to play this although some of the graphics didn't work properly. I had this game before and lost it when my computer crashed.
5,Great resource for Christian parents,Just what I needed to begin passing on Godly values to my children on a daily basis! Excellent!
2,Call it a 2.5,"This is a long playing shooter with very poor graphics and average sound. If you like shooters you might like this and it might be worth it for 20 bucks, but if you haven't played ghost recon, halo, etc use the money on them and see what the xbox can do. This game might be alright for playstation II users but it doesn't really make the cut on xbox."
1,A MAJOR LETDOWN FOR XBOX FANS,"This is another PC ported game that is a complete miss. Like some PC ports that end up on the XBOX,they are better than the PC version but not with Soldier Of Fortune 2. This game looks bad graphically and plays terrible with lousy AI. There is no excuse the XBOX is far capilable of more and this is unexcusable game,I thought the PC verison Soldier Of Fortune 2 was bad but this port is worse. However the ported game does get rid of the annoying fog issue like the stupid PC title,so that is one positive. BOTTOM LINE:NOT EVEN WORTH A RENTAL,BUT AS FAR AS BUYING SAVE UP FOR QUALITY GAMES[HALO,DOA3,NINJA GAIDEN,SOUL CALIBUR 2,HALO 2(MID 2004),DOA 4(TBA)]"
4,Great action game,"If you liked Half Life, Doom, Halo or Wolfenstein, you'll love this game. Just like all the others I mentioned, the game play is pretty much the same. The controls are pretty straightforward and the graphics are nice. The only downside is that you can't control the brightness which can be a problem at times, especially if you play during the day. During your different missions, you acquire various weapons to help you on your journey. This is a really great game and one to add to your collection."
3,Not her best work,"I purchased this book because of Wolf House etc. However, this book is slow going, even for a voracious reader. The names are similar, and it is very difficult to differentiate between various personalities, so I always felt somewhat lost, going back to the beginning to try to figure out who was who. It's also very dense, and slow to take off."
3,A warm up for Wolf Hall,"Mantel develops her style in this too long book, the technique of the disinterested observer's voice, but it works better in Wolf Hall where she uses it on fewer subjects - actually one."
4,"YOU MUST WORK AT THIS, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY WORTHWHILE","THIS IS A COMPLEX NOVEL,ONE NEEDS TO TAKE NOTES.A CLEVER FORMAT,FULL OF FUN CONJECTUREI,M SURE I,VE LEARNED SOME HISTORY WHILE BEING VASTLY ENTERTAINED"
4,Avatar of later works,"A little difficult to read in that the cast of characters is immense, and keeping track of them is not always easy. One can see in this first ambitious novel an avatar of the form she so masterfully developed, particularly with respect to the dialogue, in the first two books of her prize-winning ""Thomas Cromwell"" series which I have read twice (and for those books, family trees and ""notes on the cast"" are provided for readers who need help with the history. Something similar might also have helped for ""A Place of Greater Safety"". Parts of this book were wonderful; parts were somewhat tedious. I remain a huge fan of Mantel's."
5,Unforgettable,"This is one of the rare novels of historical fiction that completely captures the true spirit and essence of its subject. Powerfully moving, ""A Place of Greater Safety"" expresses the views and ideals of the Revolution, through the lives and words of Camille Desmoulins, Georges Danton, and Maximilien Robespierre. The author is, amazingly, able to depict her characters' emotions with so much depth and truth, that by the end of the novel, you will question all you think you understand of the French Revolution and the people who believed in its cause. This book gives the reader a taste of both the beauty behind the emotions which governed the people of France, and of the tragedy that sent so many to their deaths in the early, volatile days of the Republic. A story of the despair of a people and a merciless strugle for justice, ""A Place of Greater Safety"" is a masterpiece that will not soon be forgotten."
5,Exactly what I pictured,"I read previous comments to get an Idea of what I was ordering. It was exactly as I expected. An awesome instructional video. Yes it was a little boring with no music but I did not purchase it for entertainment. A previous customer complains how boring it is and gave it a low rating. Joey Atlas mentions multiple times that he has no music so you can listen to your own. If he has music you wouldn't be able to hear the important instructions. He also tells you to pause when you need to, to complete your reps. The moves are pretty basic and after watching it a few times you should have the routine memorized and do it on your own. This is great for beginners! My only complaint is I'm not a beginner. These are basic moves I already knew of and was hoping I would learn something different. I'm just glad I found it used on Amazon & didn't pay full price!"
1,Poor reliability and poor service,"I was excited when I first saw this camera and had to have it. When I got I found it was easy to use and took great pictures. But then after a few months it stopped working. I contacted service in NJ and sent it into then. They said I would have an answer back in ""2-3"" days. That turned into two weeks. My emails to then asking for status were deleted and not read (I asked for a read receipt). I finally got a letter from them to authorize the service (under warranty). Time estimate for the repair was 4-5 weeks. Nearly eight weeks later I am still waiting for it. I always considered Leica to be the Rolls Royce on cameras but unfortunately, in retrospect I wish I had bought a Canon or a Nikon."
3,Leica V-lux,The camera came without the lens hood and the patch cables. These items cost over $100. I am dissatisfied with the vendor. I paid the market price for the camera.
1,No longer supported by Remington!,Bought this shaver from Amazon - it arrived with a defective battery. Sent it to Remington and they replaced it with the MS-5200 model which feels cheaply built and is unbelievably loud. Beware! Remington apparently no longer supports the MS3-2700.
5,Classic Bouncing Souls,"If you like the Bouncing Souls, you wont be disappointed. I'm a BMX racer and I love The BMX Song. The rest of the CD is great too."
5,"Feelin' like a ""Wuz""","I can't imagine how she stayed with this voyage til the end. I thought I was an adventurer having been a day sailer,an assistant commercial fisherman, a USO entertainer and a 3rd world nurse..but Tania--she's the queen!! Best book I ever read. Hat's off to you Lady."
3,not that great,"Could have been written better I think. I had to re-read some sentances a few times to understand them. Sometimes I had to back read just to figure out what she was talking about. Maybe I'm just stupid. The places she visits are interesting. Sometimes while reading the book I got in a fetal position and quivered while thinking about how little she knew about sailing before taking off into the ocean. I imagin by the time she got home from her circumnavigation she had learned enough, and gained enough sailing experience to start her circumnavigation. all in all it was worth the read and entertaining. But I would reccomend ""Confessions of a Long Distance Sailor"" by Paul lutus instead of this book. its written far better, has just as many aventures, is far more education in a worldly and sailing sense, and best of all, its free. just search for it on the web, then you can download it.CheersChad"
3,Shalkingley Powerful and Butiful,"This is the albumb that got me in to Kitaro. It is very powerful and made for the soul. Highley recomended for people seariousley in to spirituality or meditation. To give an idea my brother saw A picture of him on stage with A 6 ft horn and dry ice in the air and nick named him Mr. Bong Horn. Not recomended for those who don,t listen with the soul."
5,Best book on woodies and mandarins ... a real delight !,"For anyone interested in woodies or mandarin ducks there is not a more delightful informative book available(I know because I have them all I think). Well written, beautiful photography,a real joy to read."
4,Art's quartet live at the Keystone in August 1977,"This album finds Art Pepper at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco a week after his historic stand at the Village Vanguard in NYC. While this set doesn't quite reach the same heights, it comes close enough to satisfy. Pianist George Cables is a constant, but the N.Y.-based George Mraz and Elvin Jones are replaced by Michael Formanek and Eddie Marshall on bass and drums on this set. The four tracks all break the 11-minute mark, allowing for plenty of extended improvisations by Art and George. Kenny Dorham's ""Blue Bossa"" and Art's own ""Samba Mom Mom"" allow the players to work a latin groove, and Eddie Marshall aggressively pushes the beat on these tunes with powerful rhythmic accents. ""Art Meets Mr. Beautiful"" is an upbeat stomp, and the Burke-Van Heusen ballad ""Here's That Rainy Day"" is given a moving rendition with Art at his emotive best."
5,What a breath of fresh air Space Empires V is,"SE V is one of those rare games where once you have grasped the basics then you start to peel back the layers before you know it's 3 am!! Think of it as Civilization in space. Except that it uses a tech-tree that's an order of magnitude larger, much more devious AI (that doesn't cheat) and a phenominal socio-political model that really challenges the player.The graphics and menus are not as polished as current uber-titles like Company of Heroes, Supreme Commander or Battlefield 2042 so an uber graphics card is not required, however this game can really use a fast CPU to manage all the AI player resolution activity.Thus if you are only looking for eye-candy and a short quick action-packed visual game - give SE V a miss. But if you really want the ultimate thinking grand space-opera strategy game - this is the only one you'll ever need!!!"
5,Space saver and situation saver...,"I have had the 130 since August 2008 and it does everything I have asked it to, and more. I bought it to replace the 85 when my office replaced my previous laptop with a Dell Latitude E4300. In addition to the standard tips, I bought the S35 for the Dell as well as tips for my cell phone and MP3. I can charge and power both my laptop and cell phone simultaneously with it.It allows me to take a single charger for my various gadgets, which is a great space and weight saver on my business trips. Also, Several times I have been able to loan it out to keep friends, coworkers and clients working when they misplaced their own chargers. I keep all the extra tips with me for just such an occasion.Recommended for anyone who needs maximum flexibility in a power supply. But as others have said, carefully review compatibility with your own laptop before buying."
5,Tripp Lite1000VA UPS,"This was a replacement for the same model I bought 2 years ago which sadly met its demise. The good, and bad news, we had an electrical storm that fried alot of equiptment in the house. The Tripp lite was one of them that died but my computer and accessories that were plugged into it were fine. Another family member had another major brand UPS and the power supply in the computer was toast along with a $110.00 bill to follow at the computer repair shop + a new UPS. I'm glad I had a Tripp Lite and only had to replace that and not a computer repair bill on top of that. The Tripp Lite did its job and I trust this device with some very expensive computer equiptment. AAA+++ Buy one, they work."
1,Stay Away!!! died after 3 months,Ok here is the story....it was fine for the first three months....after that it started to shut down without a reason....bad custumer support....and now i have a very expensive brick.....stay away....pay a little more and get a better brand...
2,Buyers beware,"Buyers beware of buying this product. I have gone through two of these and they were all less than a year old. First one was replaced under warranty by Tripp-Lite. Tripp-Lite was great to work with, but I will never buy any of their products again. This product looks very nice from the outside, but has poor reliability inside. Both had the same problem of shutting off for no apparent reason. These units would shut off several times throughout the day and sometimes it took several tries to turn back on. Spend the extra money and look somewhere else."
5,The best of the world,"""I am brasilian and i love SANDY E JUNIOR this album in english is prov of your talent..the single Love never fail is beautiful.."""
3,"It's for developers, not admins!","The book details the IPv6 protocol in excruciating detail, with packet diagrams, etc. It shows the details of addressing, routing, etc. A good book for a developer who is creating an IPv6 protocol stack or an application developer.However, for system administrators there is only ONE chapter of interest - and that chapter should have been made into an entire book. This chapter details how to start to use IPv6 with Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and others. Each OS is described in a page or two: each should have an entire chapter to itself. Now THAT would be a book worth reading.If you're a developer, this might be a good book. If you're a sysadmin, forget it."
4,I liked it--plain and simple.,I won't say much because it'll ruin the entire story. But this is a wonderful book to read for all Star Wars fans. I highly recommend it
3,"Amazing story, style fair","Agree with other reviews: incredible story, needs to heard; writing style not polished, story jumps around, not focused on one or two characters."
4,An Important chapter in the History of a people and WWII,"Defiance by Nechama Tec is a well researched, well documented look at the hitory of the Jewish people living in Western Belarus during the events leading up to and during World War II.Painting a vivid picture of the chaos of war, the fight for survival and the plight of a people who were nearly wiped out by the germans during their occupation of Poland through the return of the russian army at the end of the war. A Compelling look at those who refused to set quietly await death.A little dry and difficult to read, as it could have been presented in an easier to read, less research paper/Documentary format. And the author is sometimes a bit ethnocentric in the way she presents things. but over all a necessary read for anyone who wants to understand the plight of the Jewish people during World War II."
4,Excellent,"This is an excellent book. The brothers were more focused on saving their fellow Jews than killing Germans. Other partisan groups tried to force them into raids on Germans at the expense of saving older Jews and children. They did their share of killing while assuring the safety of the group. It is truly amazing that the brothers were able to save over 1,000 Jews while living in the forest. The author shows them as both loving heroes as well as harsh taskmasters. This is one case where the end truly justified the means."
4,Been waiting 40 years for a trustworthy account of Jewish partisans in Poland.,"It's been forty years since I read 'Treblinka' by Jean-Francois Steiner ( a flawed book, I've now come to understand, since that author took liberties with history). I've longed to read a true, verifiable history of Jewish partisans in Poland from a legitimate scholar, and it seems that Nechama Tec has provided a trustworthy account in this book. I applaud her for believing in this project and for the filmmakers for bringing this lost story to the screen."
4,Good enough,"First off, Goodbye, Mr. Cool and War of the Underworld are not part of the Y&D; series. Also it is missing the movie Once Upon A Time in Triad Society, so this is not really a complete series set of Y&D; films. There was a CD of music not mentioned in the description, so you do get something more then excepted.The quality is good considering the age and technology used to make the first couple of movies. The subtitles for most of the movies did not work on my laptop but worked on the DVD player.If your a Y&D; fan or a fan of Hong Kong movies, this is a good buy."
4,Beautiful detail,"I love them, they have so much detail. also bought the necklace.and they are made of recycle glass!"
4,"Classic Southern style Rock, class!","great band, wonderful collection of songs. Lead singer has a brilliant voice and they just rock! Kings of Leon must have been inspired by this talented bunch of musicians. Well worth owning. Period."
3,"Excellent, but unveven","A tremendous collection of songs here. The ""hits"" are primarialy compiled on the first Volume, but there is plenty of worthy music to be found here. ""Born on the Bayou"", for instance, is essential, as are many songs here like ""Wrote a Song for Everyone"". But there is also some lesser-quality work here, which makes for a more uneven listen. Throw Vols 1 & 2 in a changer together, hit random, and it's a hell of a listen!"
5,More From The Best American Band of the 1960's,"If you liked the 1st Chronicle, give this a try. It picks up ""Suzie Q"" (Part 2) where part 1 left off and includes the classic ""Born on the Bayou"". This collection includes not only important ""B-sides"" (like the 2 mentioned) but regular album cuts like ""Good Golly Miss Molly"", ""It Came Out of the Sky"", ""Wrote a Song for Everyone"", ""Before You Accuse Me"", and the essential ""Midnight Special"". If you're still hungry for more after both Chronicle CD's, then you need to buy their original albums!"
5,one for the boat,Shipped quickly. Product is exactly as advertised. Mounted in boat glove compartment beside my radio for easy access in safe place.
3,Second rate Introduction to the Topic,"The book does very little to introduceyou to te theory and practical uses behind kettlebells. The book does a thoruogh listing of bodybuilding type exercises using the the kbs, but only about five pages are devoted to the olympic type lifts which hard core athletes purchase kbs for. Save your money and visit hte bodybuilding.com kb site for a primer on kb exercises."
5,This Book Was Really Really GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It was the first pike book i had read and i just could'nt put it down!!Infact i read it in less then a day!!
5,Excellent Book,"This book is simply written, very easy to understand and brimming with information for the beginner quilter."
4,Lupine Collar,Love the Lupine products. The martingale type collar is perfect for dogs that slip out of regular collars. The blaze orange is great for our dog during hunting season -- can never be too careful!
5,Guaranteed against chewing!,"Lupine combo collars are an outstanding buy. They are well made and comfortable for the dog, yet designed to prevent your dog from escaping accidently. And they are guaranteed, even if chewed! Lots of colors and patterns. You can't go wrong with a Lupine combo collar!"
3,Not exactly Blaze Orange,sturdy leash that should last a life time. If you check the orange against something blaze orange you will see a difference.
1,I was made to feel that Ted Bundy was the victim,"This woman became a pawn in the twisted little world Bundy lived in. To think that he felt sorrow for anyone other than himself is a shame. Bundy was not a victim of some unjust system.The story goes on about how she was trying to save his life. How cruel it was to have him come so close to death only to get a stsy. I say nothing can compare to the fear and pain he caused. If you want your heart to bleed for poor old Ted read this book, if not read something by someone who helped put this devil away"
1,Dont bother if you really need a brash brush,Got a weber grill with porcelain grates that can only be cleaned with brass brushes...these arent brass...company sends them anyway...got a refund but total waste of time!
1,There are better books for trying to awaken a kid's interest in electricity,"I was given this book before I was 6 (I'm 58 now). Even then, the fact that Rusty was too ignorant to know enough to strip the insulation off the wires so the electricity could flow and make his bell ring was simply appalling to me. I never forgot how stupid this book was, and on a whim, I did a Google search for it (and that's why I'm here). Don't waste your money on this ridiculous book. There are far better ones, and those better ones let me to a career in electronics engineering. Rusty won't do that for your kid, believe me."
3,Rusty Rings a Bell,"A delightful childhood memory from a rural Minnesota background. Hands on learning for budding physicists that can learn from the pre computer generation. Ring the bell, Rusty,,,,,,kids are hearing......even 50 year oldsters1"
5,Highly useful and well written workbook!,"This is a practical and ""easy to use"" book. For anyone who has to work with other people (isn't that most of us?) this book offers a clear map to navigate the process. Filled with worksheets, charts, and carefully outlined steps, it addresses every part of the collaborative process. It includes activities to get others on board with collaborative initiatives. I highly recommend it."
1,TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY,This album sounds terrible. It blars. Can't distinguish individual sounds. The perforomance itself is also lousy.It's a waste o0f money. Sorry that I bought it!!
4,Purchased for my class study,I purchased this book for my class study in graduate school. It served my purposes and was cheaper than the price at the bookstore.
5,Very nice knives,"Not too heavy, not too light, these knives are elegant and sturdy - perfect for entertaining or every day use. Dishwasher-safe was a key selling point for me, and Gourmet Settings is true to their word. All their cutlery is awesome, and customer service (whom I contacted for replacement pieces) was excellent! Will not hesitate to purchase any Gourmet Settings product!"
4,easy to learn--contains some moving moments,"Since this work was written for the Scouts of Europe, it is easy to perform. The attached comments contain information on where to find the musical score. Nice work for school projects or other amateur groups. Much of this work is in French."
2,Promising Book Breaks Promise,"This book starts out just fine. Spencer lines you up with XML in an easily understandable manner. Unfortunately, he then kills it all by taking you on a trip that can only be used by IE5 browsers. In the real world, one has to allow that right now very few people use IE5 and most web sites are not going to want to forego all visitors who don't use it. His sample implementation even tells the visitor that if he doesn't have IE5 he needs to go get it then come back. This won't cut it! The author doesn't seem to understand that a general or business site needs to allow for nearly the lowest end browser so as to not exclude potential customers. If this were a more browser friendly book, it would be excellent."
4,Meavis Beacon rules!,Meavis Beacon teaches typing really works within days your typing will be perfect! I really think this program rules!
2,Not good for smart toddlers,"This car seat is not good for smart toddlers. My daughter just turned two and she has figured out how to loosen the harness and straps. The mechanism is very accessible to the seated child and there is no locking mechanism to prevent your child from basically getting out of the car seat. This is TERRIBLE!!! I have read many reviews before buying our britax marathon, and everyone seemed to like their seat and no one mentioned this important safety failure. i will have to let britax know, and this may result in a recall."
1,DO NOT BUY - NOT SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,My 20 month old son can reach the lever and lossen the shoulder straps. He is not a geninus - any other 20 month old can do the same. I can't believe this car seat has not been recalled.
4,Good Read To Determine If Tandeming Is 4U,"My wife and I had already been tandem riders for 13 years before I decided to read this book. I originally purchased this book, because it was written by the original owner of Rodriguez Cycles and we own one of his tandems. I was surprised at the detail, plus tricks and tips for a novice, I wish I had not learned from this book rather than the hard way (trial and error), even though we are experienced riders it still had things we learned, plus it made me more cognizance of duties for the captain (front), also the stokers (back) position that I had not thought about before.This book is a must read if you and your partner that are contemplating a tandem or just a want to learn more about tandem cycling."
2,"these stockings come way, way short","Hi ladies. I'm 5' 9"" and 125 lbs. I am not huge. These stockings, though sexy as hell, came up to above my knee and I believe they're listing them as 'one size'. We're not all one size. We're SO not. So, I'd say, if you're about 5'5"", knock yourself out, you'll look super hot. the line up the back is gorgeous, the foot is classy, the sheerness is really nice.It would be great if the maker was either up-front about the sizing or willing to make a range of sizes."
1,Piece of CRAP! Don't waste your money,"What a piece of crap! Don't waste your money on this pile of junk. It makes a huge mess all the time and constaintly spits out the drink at the top! The spicket leaks on the counter, and it creates a constaint mess!!! I can't believe this piece of junk is actually sold on Amazon.com. Don't buy!!! Don't Buy!! DON'T BUY THIS!!!!"
1,Fine... when it works,"I got a margarator for christmas. Now, I'm not greedy, I understand that this thing won't churn out restaurant-quality margs, and that's fine. But it didn't work at all. So, I returned it and got another. It made some good drinks. Watery? Yes. Lumpy? Yes. I could produce better margs with my home blender, but it takes a lot more work. So, the margarator delivered a decent enough product. That is, until it broke. I used it 4-5 times, and then it just fizzled out and stopped working. Evidently, they aren't made to last. More is the pity."
3,Ours was OK,"From reading all of the bad reviews, I think we lucked out with ours. It worked great - made really good margaritas. We filled to the top with ice, then 3 to 1 mix ratio. Ours worked fine for lots of parties for almost a year! Then it just stopped working! We were so sad as we had guests arriving, so we ran to a few different stores but couldn't find another one! Now I see why! Looks like no one wants to carry it anymore!The thing that was great was that we could make one batch at they would last most of the day. We weren't constantly at the blender. I went online to shop for a new one, and after reading all of these terrible reviews, I think ours was a fluke. I'm going to take another review's advice and go to Smart & Final to see if I can find a slush maker."
1,Watery-RATOR,"I am a big fan of margaritas. I was so excited when I found this machine hoping for the perfect margarita. After using it I thought this was nothing but a piece of junk! I paid a nintey bucks for one of these and it was worse than my 14 dollar blender. You pretty much have to make a gallon at a time to even get it to be slushy ice mixture but by the time you add enough ice, your drinks taste like a bad watered down mexican restauarant 2 for 1 margaritas. I followed the instuctions which are not very precise, says wait 6 to 8 min but it actually took the machine about 15-20 minutes. Oh and after about an hour it all melts down. After wasting about 40 bucks worth of tequila on this trying diff techniques I took mine back to Walmart. The customer service rep also told me it wasnt the first one that was returned for the same reason. SAVE YOUR MONEY! A Cheap blender works better than this!"
2,"Excellent premise, but sadly unfulfilled","Nancy Bogen has one of the richest stories in Greenwich Village history from which to weave her tale. However, the characters are one-dimensional and essentially uninteresting. Hippolyte's story was entirely unnecessary and added nothing to the narrative. The prologue offered tremedous promise and set me up for a fascinating story - unfortunately, the actual novel did not follow through. Such a shame."
1,Junk - doesn't even come with instructions!,Total pice of junk - came in a clear plastic bag with no packing slip or assembly instructions. Very flimsy - pin keep sliding out. What a waste of time.
4,Good for the price,"It was $10 less than in store, and works the same as the in store brand. It's a bottom of the line vacuum that works like expected."
4,pool vacuum head,I had one before from different company was much sturdier will see how this one holds up so far works as stated
2,Not nearly as good as the others,"This book is taken from an episode of the TV series and is not an ""original"" story. The writing and ""flow"" of the book is nowhere as good as the other books. I highly recommend the other books (that is, ""Not Sleepy"", ""Too Small for School"" and ""Not eat a Tomato""). I also recommend the TV series on the Disney Channel - It is one of the few children shows that all of us (adults included) enjoy."
4,Politics,"I can sympathize and empathize with the Author. I did know a few Fed Covert operators who were hung out to dry by Federal Prosecutors. Two of my cases as a State Agent, were taken, then aborted by a couple U. S. Attorneys. I had the 'goods', but they failed to follow through, very frustrating. I know, personally, the one time head of the Enforcement Division of the National Marine Fishery Service, Dave McKinney. We went through the same Alaskan Academy, Recruit Class 35 back in 1981. This is a good read and allows an insight into the slings and arrows suffered by a professional Wildlife Agent."
3,not impressed,"I love Dr Oz and find him quite trustworthy so I was excited when I bought this book, a few months before I became pregnant. I was disappointed with how little (ok, there is NONE) info there is month-by-month. I have found ""What to Expect"" to be very inacurate about nearly everything I'm experiencing so I thought mabye Dr Oz would have a more modern spin on things. Currently I am 30 weeks pregnant so maybe some of the postpartum information will be helpful, but that was not why I purchased this book in the beginning. Unless you want to be scared into never eating a slice of lunchmeat or need to be reminded that smoking and drinking are generally BAD during pregnancy... you could skip this book."
3,Good product but slow service,"I had to order this book twice. The firs time, it never came (maybe, it's due to international shipping?). But I got refund."
3,virtual pool game,the service i received was excellent. the time it was delivered was before the time stated.the only problem is it is an older game and i can only play nine ball.and the game sometimes freezes. i enjoy playing the pool game otherwise.i have had great success with Amazon and their affiliates. will continue to Amazon with my needs.
2,A very depressing book,"This book is a journal of a young woman (now a movie actor), born in Afghanistan, and her life as a child and teenager in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Canada. it is very disorganized, and does not give much analysis of the political problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan which cause such misery to her family and the population. Much description of squalid living. There does not seem to be much hope for Afghanistan, now that the educated people have left for safer countries."
5,"A wonderful, eloquent must-read book","This is one of the most eloquent books I have read in a while. Nelofer succeeds in writing about the tragic topic of Afghanistan with much grace and insight. I found her perspectives to be thought-provoking and refreshing on the subject of Afghanistan: it's wars, it's people and it's history. One of the best books I have read in a long, long time."
4,Dirty Great Omission,"How on earth could Dirty Three Not be included?! Really, almost unforgiveable. I adore Maggie's voice though."
4,Really fantastic,"Maggie Gyllenhaal deserves to have her own solo album. She may not have the best voice around, but she infuses her lyric readings with a raw kinetic passion reminiscent of a young Patti Smith. Her rendition of ""How Lucky Am I"" is truly haunting. The album is a wonderful companion piece to the underrated film from which the music is culled."
5,Works well for sensitive stomach,"We have a Van cat. He had blood in his stool for years. We were using IAMS, because that's what he grew up with. Great brand, but the problem continued. Purina One has been the only cat food that stopped it."
2,Iris Dement,"Great singer and lyricist. Some of her other albums featured gospel music much more to my liking, but this one was OK."
4,for my nephews,This was a present for my nephews who love Baseball. They enjoyed the story and it gave them a sense of self and the history of baseball from the past.
5,The Perfect Game,This is a good uplifting movie. My 7 year old grandson loves this movie. Loved it when they sit with the little colored boy and their belief in God. They were the underdogs but came out on top.
4,Another Heartwarming Feel Good Movie and That Is Not A Bad Thing,"This is a typical feel good heartwarming film based on a true story that would be perfect for the Disney Channel or other such TV station. Now this isn't a bad thing by any means, and it is actually quite a welcome respite from a lot of the other films being released lately. I would definitely recommend this as the perfect ""sit down with the entire family and watch this with a big bowl of popcorn"" moment.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVDs."
3,Limited in scope...,"Management prescriptions for primarily U.S. based companies. Surprised not to encounter intercultural training, expatriate training and/or implications for Multinational Corporations."
3,A Living Death,"This Graphic Novel is decent, but doesn't compare to The Sandman Series. It is still worth a read."
2,"Great illustration, boring book","If you enjoy top rate illustration, then buy this book. If however you're looking for a well thought out concept for a story, pass on it. Dumb and boring."
3,"Not so bad, once you know her","Death, that is. In fact, she's quite a nice young lady. Helps an old lady find something that matters to her, that kind of thing. Everyone likes her - for Death, it's always ""on the house.""Unfortunately, this doesn't present Death at her best. As part of the Sandman world, she was a much more complex and active figure. I guess the other stories set my hopes unrealistically high. That's not surprising, since Gaiman set the bar so high that not even he can match his own standard all the time.Taken by itself, this is a pleasant but undistinguished comic. As part of the Sandman mythos, however, it contributes only a little.//wiredweird"
3,Review of Gaiman's Death:Cost,"I'm sorry to say I was disappointed with this comic. The incredibly short narrative provides an interesting encounter with the character death, but there is little development or dynamism. Beyond my fascination with Gaiman, I can think of no reason to read this book. Further, the comic closes with an odd exploitation of death, as a public safety spokesman against STDs. Personally, I found an uninspiring work."
5,GREAT,"This is one of the first works by Neil Gaiman that I've read and has led me to love all his other works. The Sandman chronicles are a series of carefully planned out and seductive books, that grab you in and entrance."
5,A beautiful display of yacht decoration and craftsmanship,"This is a gem of book, more devoted to the art of designing beautiful details and accomodations in yachts, than to aspects of naval design. It deals mostly with relatively large sailing boats. Offers very interesting insights into what is appropriate in interior design and decoration of a sailing yacht and what is not, i.e. the type of textile designs used in furniture that would make you sick with movement while underway. Full of photos the book covers details in almost every area of the deck and accomodations of top-of-the-line yachts. An interesting and artful addition to a design and decoration library. Full of beautiful ideas. Well worth the price."
5,Book Yacht Style,"Excelent service, cheap, fast, good quality, even good smelling! I am totally satisfied, thak you"
2,Poorly made,"Received this leaf rake cheaply made I guess you get what you pay for,will not not buy this product again."
2,Not good for a pond.,"I did a search for pond product, and this was suggested. Although it may work well in a flat bottom pool, it is not very good on an uneven pond bottom."
1,Don't waste your money...,"I never thought I was a sucker but I must be to have purchased this product. It is truly plastastic crap. It broke shortly after I got it, the shaft having broken away from the basket in such a way that it will be nearly impossible to fix.Nevertheless, I will have to try and repair it because my ""window"" to return the item expired so quickly that I am stuck with it. Hopefully it can be recycled in its next life as an item that works as designed."
1,Lousy rake,This tool is very difficult to work with. The lip is big and does not allow leaves to slip into the netting. It can't be used without some other form of assistance.
1,cheap junk,"This is a cheap made Chinese pool rake that is all plastic. Spend a couple bucks more and get an aluminum framed rake. I doubt this crummy unit will last a month until it breaks. If I knew beforehand it was made in China, I wouldn't have bought it. Waste of money!!!"
5,One of my favorite accessory pieces!,I can't imagine my village without it! It lights up very nicely and would look great in front of any house. It even looks great in my graveyard village. The jack-o-lanterns and bags along the sidewalk light up.
3,Not long enough for a true thriller,"For all the other reviews that say this is a really scary book -- it was just too short to work me into any kind of tizzy. It's not really a romance -- don't be fooled into thinking it is, so it really doesn't succeed except as a story about a woman's encounter with a stalker. It left me feeling lukewarm at best.Like a lot of self-published books, it has its share of typos and grammatical flaws that ought to have been caught, but at least this one is better than most in that regard. I bought the book because it was recommended on the pages for a number of my favorite romance novels, so I presumed it was one. The mis-recommendation really irritated me and if the author has any control over them, she should have them limited to books that are truly similar."
1,Maybe it was in the Marketing,I bought this book because I read these good reviews. It's suppose to be a suspense drama that is scarey and will draw you in. I found it nothing like that. I found it rather predictable and without spontanaity
5,Fogs In August,"This book was GREAT! I am not much of a reader ,however, this book catured my attention from the very beginning! The characters came to life as though i knew them as friends or part if the family. I was able to relate to thier feelings,needs,all that was incompassed in their lives. The suspence kept me on the edge of my seat. You have to read this book!!! It's awesome."
2,This VERSION of this game has less than half...,"the original game's missions. It's like a long demo. thats it. go buy commmandos the original game, not the 'EARLY BATTLES'"
3,Difficult hardware,Great table;easy to put together...HOWEVER... my husband is in construction and complained about the difficult hardware included. The screws broke 2 drill bits and he had to find more appropriate screws to complete putting the table together.
1,VERY DISPLEASED,I ordered this book on October 15th and have not recieved it. The delivery date has been delayed for months!! Cancelling order.
5,Excellent choice!,I purchased this book as an additional tool to help in my weight loss program. I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires more of God and less of a struggle with food.
5,The Tooth Fairy Kit Is The Greatest Gift For A Child Loosing A Tooth!,"I recently purchased three Tooth Fairy Kits,beautifully illustrated by Becky Kelly,one for my friend Dawn Dowgiallo Hartson'sdaughter, Meghan & one for my friend, Ann Wood'sdaughter, Mae who had just lost a tooth.I mailed it to Meghan & Mae, and to their delightthey were thrilled and overjoyed to receivethis as a gift. Often times, when a child loosesa tooth, it can cause a worry or two, but ifthey receive this gift, it brings on a comfortingmeaning & dimension to those children thatloose a tooth. The kit contains a tiny yellowsilk pillow, a white organza pouch and a journalto record when the Tooth Fairy visited."
1,Fairy sized tooth fairly kit,It was not much bigger than a match box and delivered in a box the size of a shoebox. Very poor value for money but great if you are fairy sized. I sent it back!Tooth Fairy Kit
4,It works great - only one complaint,I like this bag really well with the exception that I wish there was a quick snap on the top opening. I adjusted the inside pockets around so that I can carry my digital SLR with an attached zoom lens and there is still room in the side pocket for 1 other lens.
5,camera bag,"The Tamrac 5767 Sling Pack was everything I had hoped it would be, funtionality is super, been using this bag every since I recieved it for band competitions and football games. Not found one problem with this bag. Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a sling bag for all around use. Great Product"
3,Nikon D80 fits nicely but......,"a little more thickness would be ideal... say an additional inch or so. The camera fits snugly inside but taking out the camera is a bit difficult. I like the way the bag opens outwards so there is easy access to the camera. The problem is, the flap that covers the zipper is hemmed in too tight, the zipper does not glide smoothly and therefore takes longer to open. For a product that boasts easy access to camera within seconds, this product falls a little short in that regard. The shoulder strap could use more cushioning and the internal dividers are hard to adjust. Fumbling with Velcro fasteners in such a tight space could really try your patience. On the positive side, the bag feels comfortable and secure over the shoulder and back, and, with the help of the waist straps could be repositioned quickly from back to front with just a twist. That's a nice feature for when riding a bike too."
5,Great bag,"Love this bag. I have a canon eos xt, a 17-70mm lens, and a 17-300mm lens. I also keep two lens hoods in the bag, usually nestled with a lens. I just got an extention tube, and am hoping to find a safe place to keep it tucked away. But that's all you can fit in the bag, well, with small things in the front pocket.I really like the bag though, I hope to upgrade to a larger one when need be."
2,good but not good enough,"Got this in today and I loaded up my gear and walked around the house to get a feel for it. I have had other sling type backpacks but this camera bag was uncomfortable. I have a xsi w/18-135 w/hood, 430exii flash, 50mm 1.4 w/hood, extra battery and cards. With this load it puts a strain on my shoulder. The padding could of been thicker and longer. The materials are great as well as the build quality. Access to equipment is ok. I found myself fiddling with the zipper and flaps to get the camera out. Its a very tight fit with the stuff I have."
1,Well-made but uncomfortable/inconvenient,"I loaded this pack with my camera gear (Olympus E-520 & 4 lenses, plus minor accessories) & walked around the house - after only a few minutes, I realized that I would not find it at all comfortable for any real field use! With some additional ""fiddling"", I found that if the pack is adjusted to ride high enough on your back to be even semi-comfortable, it is so high that accessing the gear when swung around to the front is quite awkward - if it's adjusted low enough to allow easy access to your gear, it rides so low that it becomes even more uncomfortable & floppy. I returned the pack - & returned to my ""tried & true"" ancient Lowepro belt rig with padded camera case & auxiliary pouches for lenses, etc. Although this ""Sling Pack"" sounds like a great idea, I think that either a belt rig or conventional-style backpack is going to be much better, in terms of both comfort &/or accessibility, depending on the bulk & weight of the gear you want to carry."
5,That summer at American Beach,"I loved this book ""That summer at American Beach"" it held all the elements a great book has to offer. Janice Sims is an excellent writer who truly knows how to capture her characters. This book had a little bit of everything in it. There was some romance, laughther, drama, and suspense all in this book. I really enjoyed this book.Crystal (Chicago,IL)"
2,Doesn't deliver on its premise.,"What a disappointment. Many of the stories are from the thirties and forties, and they sound like it. Unless you're really into the pulp classic writing (and I'm not) you've probably never heard of most of the authors. All in all, I found it a waste of time reading this book"
5,Excellent instructional West African Dance video,"Great video for beginner and intermediate African dancers. Yossouf clearly demonstrates the proper way to do each step. As well, he gives the origin, and purpose of each dance. This video is even great for beginner African djembe drummers since the djembe break is demonstrated for each associated dance."
3,Turns sturf coming out Green,"Mainly recommended for Colon and Intestinal support. But Don't waste your money. You have to take double to triple the recommended dose for at least a week before will see a slight change, but there are better supplements to aid digestion far better than this crap."
5,A Primer For The Creative-Challenged,"""Whack"" is just plain good. With an entertaining manner, the author gives the nuts-and-bolts of being creative. A fast reader will get through it in an hour or so, but everyone should slow down and think about what Von Oech says.I personally credit this book with showing me how to excercise my creativity, which had always yielded uneven results before. Even more, I've taught the techniques and know they can help everyone from gifted artists to techno-geeks to MBAs.Hooray for Roger Von Oech!"
4,Ouch!!,I found that this book is inspiring and awesome. I am taking writing courses in college and never realized how much I needed to re-learn. This makes is fun to learn again. Plenty of ideas and ways to stay on track.......
4,Great Doggett pics!,"i saw this first in a book store and nearly jumped out of my skin. of course i bought it, and the best 13 bucks i've ever spent. march is a naked doggett from the gift, wonderful pic, and december is also a doggett, this pic from medusa. there could of been some better pictures taken, especially the month where the picture is an overhead from the beginning of surekill. BUT, the doggett pics were awsome, so that is def. a plus! i really hope they make a 2003 calender, for the 9th season!"
5,fishfinder,I ordered it as a gift and it arrived on time and in perfect condition and the reciepent seemed very happy.
3,The Sequal,This book is the sequal to Dragon of the lost sea. I Liked this book better than the Dragon of the Lost sea because it had more adventure.I read this book right after the first book. I liked this book and would recomend this to people who like fantisy and adventure books. I thought this book was easy reading and very entertaining.
1,So disappointed in the Kindle Version,"I think this is probably as good as other James Allen books I have read, but the Kindle version is so difficult to read I keep getting lost--words are mysteriously divided in strange ways, some lines are strangely short, some begin with the comma that should have ended the previous line. New chapters begin in the middle of a page. It is so poorly organized it's just frustrating to try to read."
4,"Good ""Cliff's Notes"" reference","This book is the most inclusive denominations book I've seen yet. However, in the all-inclusiveness it loses many pertinant details specific to the denominations, choosing to lean more on the history of the denominations instead. Some of the terminology can be cumbersome and far above that that the average reader may understand. Still, it does give a little insight and has a reasonably good index, so it's probably worth the money. Just don't expect it to be your stand-alone resource on the topic."
4,Obscure Fogerty album is a pleasure to listen to.,"An enjoyable album, so long as your taste runs to country/bluegrass/gospel. It is a fine example of his many singing talents. There is a particularly good rendition of Blue Ridge Mountain Blues. Fogerty one day should do an album of traditional songs like that one."
4,if you like bluegrass and John Fogerty,"My husband went on for years about the Blue Ridge Rangers and how he wanted the album. As far as I know, he is the only one to even know of it's existence. When this became available, he insisted I buy it for him. I'm not a bluegrass fan, but I do like John Fogerty. This has some really down to earth old time blue grass music and John Fogerty's unmistakable style and voice. It's worth having if you love Blue Grass music or love John Fogerty."
5,Twixit Clips,This is a terrific product. I seal all my opened bags of perishable products with this -- everything stays fresh!! I purchased three orders of these sealers.
2,maybe ok for older kids,I bought this stroller because I got the graco travel system first as a gift. That stroller was way to heavy for me so needed something lightweight. The Aria is lightweight however very difficult to maneauver. It gets stuck and the basket below is to tight to hold an average baby bag. I wish i never got this one. The cupholder at the top broke and we lost the connector. My child is 10 months old and the harness is awful...she likes to sit close to the front and the seat is too deep...maybe when she gets older this might fit better but by then we'll just use an umbrella stroller.The recline sucks too.
4,WELL WORTH THE MONEY,"Obviously some of these reviewers have just had bad luck with this stroller. True, the snack/cup holder is a joke and kept popping out since day one and it's a little hard to clean if you have kids that make a real mess with stuff like ice cream and such, but I've got to tell you, this stroller has taken a beating and is still holding strong. It's been to Australia and back 8 times, not to mention the amount of trips its travelled by air all over the USA. Now you know how luggage gets thrown about and treated at the airport, right? So, it's a fantastic stroller to travel with... light and super durable!"
2,not worth it,"I did a lot of research before buying this stroller and thought I had a winner. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed with my purchase. Yes, it is very lightweight and easy to open and close; however, the steering is awful. Going straight is fine, but trying to turn corners around clothing racks in a store is a nightmare. The harness hooks to the back cushion but comes undone as soon as my daughter gets in, allowing her to lean forward as far as she wants. The cupholder on the child's tray doesn't even fit her sippy cup. I do not feel the price and quality of this product match."
4,"Light, functional, smooth riding - incredible stroller","Did a lot of research with stroller weight being a key factor. Chose the Aria OH as it was the most functional lightweight stroller. What's great is that it is a full stroller - nothing like an umbrella stroller.Pros - Large seat area for child, easy reclining adjustment, large and adjustable canopy top, large storage basket, easily maneuverable with one hand, easily open and closed with one hand (once you get the hang of it).Cons - Cheap and easily broken cup holder, can't really see child when canopy is open."
2,Horrible,"I got these in plus size, and I am well within the weight range. These seriously muffin-top my thighs. They roll down LIKE MAD. They developed a run right out of the package, before I even put them on. The stay-up material was very itchy, and made it difficult to attach a garter belt. And, they also are very short compared to what I was expecting/wanting, hitting just above my knees, and I am not a tall girl.They are pretty... but very bad quality/sizing."
3,"Not mind-blowing, but nice","Well these tights do get mad points for stay-up-ability and comfort. The little rubbery strip that keeps them up works wonderfully. They are dark and sexy and the lace looks very nice. The only negatives were that one of them was slightly shoddier made than the other (the seam was a bit off) and they were a bit shorter than I expected. I have really long legs, but I can't wear these under anything I own because the lace shows. They would have been perfect if they were only a smidge longer.That said, I still love them and they def. make me feel sexy"
2,Snag SOOO Easily!,"I had these on for maybe a minute and somehow one got a snag. It didn't even happen while putting them on, I was extremely delicate because they felt kinda flimsy from the start. On the other hand, they did feel secure like I wouldn't have to worry about them slipping down my leg. I'm 5'10, 175lbs and they fit me great, no bulge at the top of the thigh high. I really wish the quality was better though. One wear out of these would've been nice..."
3,Bargain Stockings,I bought these stockings because of the price. They fit OK and the looks are not bad but they did not have that silky feel I was looking for when I bought them. They seem to be sturdy enough so I don't have any thing bad to say about them just not the silky feel I wanted.The shipping was great I received them within the time I was supposed to and the package was in good shape.
3,"It works, mostly","5 port switch, not exactly 100mb (12.5MB) capable, i usually get anywhere from 8MB/s down to 3MB/s depending on how many people are moving things over the network, all in all though its stable and i've never had a problem with it."
4,It's a great true story,"I was actually searching for bibles when I fell upon this title. I thought since it was free I would give it a try. I give it 4 stars due to there is not much detail explanations. It basically a book about a boy going to war and he is a very nasty to his parents. Ends up getting a bible from his mom for a going away present. He forgets about it and goes on and on with stuff he does with it. It's a good story if you want things left to your imagination most of the time. There is very little detail and a few errors in this kindle edition. A few punctuations that just aren't suppose to be there (one or two in I think close to the end of the book), but if you look at it as a good Christian based story this one is pretty good. It's worth a read for anyone really."
2,A distinct change in direction from thier first album,"This album, as a comparison to thier first, is much slower, better-produced, more mainstream in it's song construction and riffage, and takes leaps at strange attempts at innovation including heavy use of a mouth harp and even a hand-clap track like in some 50's pop song. Pretty much a let-down."
4,Ages well like fine wine,"Greg Kihn puts together an excellent batch of songs ranging from a Kink's cover to catchy originals like ""Vampira"". The highlight has to be the title track and ""Trials, troubles, and tribulations""."
2,Can this be true?,"I have read numerous accounts of men in war and until I read this one, I never had a doubt about the truth. However, this book reads like fiction. I hope I'm wrong but I thought I was reading a Jack Higgins novel. I gave Tommy LaMore the benifit of the doubt and decided to research the man. I was unable to find one written word about him. If his exploits are true, I would love it if someone could point me in the right direction and find a independent biography on him."
1,Dull,Put them in and realized they put out zero light and the 'blue' look they have looks terrible. I immediately took them out.
1,CRAP CRAP CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IM FURIOUS! THESE THINGS ARE'NT BLUE, NOT WHITE, BUT THEY LOOK LIKE NORMAL HEADLIGHTS!!! please people invest in xenon HID's."
1,Undesired,"Don't be fooled, this isn't a new book; it was written in 1994 and it shows. The plot line is extremely thin with page after page of the characters' rambling inner thoughts. Dayne is a headstrong Southern belle whose father and his live-in mistress (a distant relation) are trying to marry off. She deliberately loses her virginity to Flint in rather dull sex scenes that bear no resemblance to the erotic sex scenes Devine is writing today. There is very little conflict or suspense in the book. You know that Dayne and Flint will be forced to wed and will eventually come around to love. The journey to that point is very disappointing. Do not buy this book."
5,How Did I Miss These Guys,Had never heard of the Bhundi Boys until reading a biography on John Peel.There was an excerpt where a collegue said that this is the only band he knows of that made John cry due to the beauty of their art. Ans John was right. Amazing rythms and beautiful arrangements make for one of the most enjoyable listens in a long time.
4,Nuxalk Dictionary,"This relatively slim volume has about 2000 entries, each with word variants and sample sentences. Its usefulness is a bit hampered by lack of an index (the dictionary is Nuxalk-English only) or a useful pronunciation guide. Still, this is an interesting book on a language that has very little other material available."
3,Coby Boombox,The box appears cheaply made. The switched are wobbly and feel like they won't last very long.
2,I would not buy it again.,"I bought 1 to use at work, it worked fine, so I bought 1 for use at home. It lasted about a month, then started having problems with it playing cd's & mp3/cds it would not read them. I had to wiggle or remove the powercord.That work for awhile, then even that would not get it to work. The one I had at work lasted about ayear. Then it would work only with batteries. So I am going to try a different brand this time. I have heardfrom too many places that the Coby brand won't read the cd's & mp3/cds. And I need a player that will playcds, mp3cds, cass, & radio. I play music, or audio books all the time."
2,Coby MP-CD450 Portable MP3/CD Player with AM/FM Tuner and Cassette Deck,"The arrival time was excellent, but I expected more from the speakers.The appearance was just as it was advertised. I would'nt recomment this product to a friend or family member."
1,"Great read if you are athiest, libreal and gay","If you have any religion, are Married to a man or in any way conservitive you will find this book insulting. Its one thing to have an opinion and greacefully get the point across its another to beat the reader over the head with profanities if God forbid you have a diffrent opinion. 40 pages into the book and I could believe I wasted my money. She puts people into groups and you are either one of us or one of them. And if you are one of them she basicly tells you to burn in hell. So like I said before if you are without Any and all religion libreal and gay buy the book and enjoy. Otherwise skip it."
3,Kiss my Test,"Were the Weiners (Dr Savage's family) not immigrants? Did they not contribute to their adopted country? Are there not multiple visions of America? At a time when America is the preeminent power of the world, unequaled in the history of the world, do not alarms of American decline ring hollow? When the Republican party controls the presidency, the supreme court and the congress, can liberals be reasonably viewed as dominating political life? Dr Savage's intemperate screed falls on the sword of reality, time and time again. Constructive debate about the republic's future must stand on a more solid foundation. Preaching to the converted is no more useful, or counterproductive, to the right than to the left."
2,Sadly Unimpressed,"I was so looking forward to reading this book, and I hate the fact that I could not even finish it. What a let down. There are some bits that are funny. My favorites were the quotes from her grandmother. But as the pages turn she seems to be saying the same thing over and over and over again. She almost sounds bitter and that is really no fun. And she makes a lot of lists. This is suppose to be a witty, girl power book not a how-to book."
3,Forgettable Read,"If you're looking for a light read with the author's personal ideas on being a politically correct feminist in the '00's, then pick up this book. I was not however and was deceived by the title into thinking that this would be a witty 'guide to life' for 20somethings and was pretty put off by reading about Ms. Gilman's viewpoints for the entirety of the book. It does have its moments & most women will find themselves nodding along to the author's feministic outpourings, but mostly it's just forgettable."
2,Somewhere in the middle,Warning: This book is funny in places. BUT the humor is a bit overshadowed by the very very frequent use of the word F*ck. She also tends to take a lot of political and anti-religious stances. There is some really great material it is just to bad that it wasnt pulled together better. If you are thinking about buying this book go read parts of it at Borders or buy it used. Save your money.
1,"No, no, and no.","I've never read anything before where the author has the total opposite point-of-view about everything. I thought I could handle it. I thought it might be good to read what someone else was thinking. I was wrong, wrong, wrong. Everything Gilman is against, I am for. Everything I am for, she is against. I would just cringe every time she made some slam on anything conservative, anything Christian, anything moral. I had to stop reading about halfway through; I don't know how or why I even made it that far. If someone is insulting you, you should walk away. I wish it hadn't taken me that long to figure out I should ""walk away"" from this book. For all fellow conservative women, I would not recommend this book."
1,You're Only A Goddess If You Agree With Her Politics?,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The author doesn't try to be inclusive to all women, but rather only those who agree with her radical leftist ideology, bashing Republicans and Christians in every other paragraph. Typical narrow minded pap - if you don't play on her team, you are not worthy of being included in her little goddess circle. This book is not so much about female empowerment as it is a manifesto of the author's own bigotry against those of us with different points of view. I wish I'd saved my money."
2,Are they letting anyone write books these days?,"Yuck - Gilman obviously is very opinionated, which is good. But it seems like hers is the only opinion that matters, which is bad. Instead of elegantly making her point, she resorts to name-calling and cursing. By the end of the book, you want to do the opposite of everything she says, just to make her angrier than she already obviously is. Save your money."
2,poor attention to detail,"this could have been better. the heavier foam fabric for the shoulders and piece that hangs in front has a printed design on it, but the person who cut it out didn't pay attention and cut into the design in several places - makes it look really cheap. The mask is meant for a child - it's way too small for an adult & cuts badly into the sides of your face. The dress part also had some holes in it where they didn't quite get the pieces together when they were sewing. shoddy workmanship, but can be fixed."
2,Too Small!!,Description says it fits size 10-12 -- but it was too small for that. The head piece is cheap plastic and hurt my face.
3,"Nice, except for headpiece","I really liked the dress... I seemed of good quality. However, I was disappointed with the headpiece. The size didn't quite fit, and it didn't look at all like the one in the picture. My 6 year old daughter tried it on, and it fit her perfectly. I almost doubted if there hadn't been a mix up and I got the adult sized dress with the kid sized headpiece..."
2,Cloth will rip,I bought these to use in the gym for indoor soccer in PE classes. A few of them have already ripped. I am still looking for a good indoor soccer ball. It is soft and it controls well. Too bad it is not staying together.
4,Good quality,Arrived in new condition. My exchange student from Ecuador was thrilled when it arrived in time for his wrestling match.
4,A solid album,I had never heard of Trent Willmon until I was listening to Pandora and kept coming up. I got hooked and figured i would buy how two albums to see if I liked them as much. I was pleasantly surprised. I wish I had heard about him earlier. I would strongly advise this for someone that is interested in a new artist with a traditional sound.
5,This is the best book I have ever read!!!,"We had a book fair a few weeks ago, I saw a book that caught my interest. I went to the book and read the back of it, I looked at the other fantasy/adventure books. That one looked like the best there was.I bought the book, it was called Calling on Dragons. The next day I started reading the book. I was astonished on how it started out with the story and magic. I thought it was cool that the cats talked to Morwen.I saw in the back of the book that you had written more books. I looked in a lot of places but I could'nt find them. I really loved your book.Are you going to write more?"
5,Herzog on Awesome,"Awesome book. Very insightful, with regard to both filmmaking and life, and Herzog is simply hilarious. I don't often reread books, but this one is staying on my shelf. Great stories from Herzog's film past (every film through 2001 or so) and his approach to filmmaking."
5,Fun way to learn!,This DVD is great! The animation and the Riddlebug and Detective Slug characters are really cute and the kids love watching them! The interactive aspect of the DVD really keeps the kids engaged and focused - plus they're really learning something at the same time. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a fun learning experience for kids!
3,Cool - meets expectations :),These were pretty neat. My daughter really liked them. I'm glad they came and looked as they were advertised.
4,Works great,"This is a must have for gravy and sauces; especially Asian sauces, to avoid lumps of cornstarch or flour. This product is a great price and is made well. All of it is stainless still so durable and no rust."
5,Excellent price for nice cultured pearls.,"I gave these pearls to my girlfriend and she loved them. The price is quite reasonable. I always comparison shop when I purchase jewelry and these were exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted. These pearls are also a very good size and they are big enough to be seen, but are not ostentatious. They matched the necklace in size and color.The pearls were delivered quite rapidly. I will probably purchase jewelry from this seller in the coming months."
1,this seller was not supposed to create this listing as item was already ON Amazon for much less,"Seller was supposed to use the existing listing for the Blair doll instead of creating a new listing for three times higher. Buy her from someone else, she is a pretty doll but don't get gouged on the price by someone who doesn't play by the Amazon rules"
3,Huge disappointment,"I first heard Bromberg's music on a friend's album, and was wowed by I Will Not Be Your Fool. Bought the cassette and listened to it for years. But now its started to show its age and I decided to buy the CDWell, two CDs actually. They showed up yesterday and I eagerly opened them and gave a listen. Oh my. First of all, Fool has been edited, and the ending is not the same as the one on the cassette. Several lesser songs have been added so they could make this a 2 CD set. And there is something different about several of the songs, as if they substituted a different band for this recording (The cover says no, but it sounds quite different to me).I'm giving it 3 stars because I still love many of the songs, and if you've never heard Bromberg, you'll probably enjoy. But I'm gonna trade these in at my used record store, and see if I can find a used copy of the cassette. In the meantime, buyer beware!"
2,this book is not the 5th edition although it was under the 5th edition webpage,"I ordered it because it was under the link of used books of the 5th edition, but it is actually the 4th edition.When I received it, I realized the mistake that it was not what I needed, so that I returned it.This book should not be linked to the 5th edition, for most consumers who trust Amazon's service would order it if they do notnotice the small differences of the cover pages between the 4th edition and the 5th edition."
3,bye bye blackbird,"Fabulous, fabulous. Great standards sung with an amazing voice.Being Green and Sophisticated Lady are to die for."
3,My Opinion Only,"If you don't already have a greatest hit CD then I suggest you purchase. If you want one, I suggest another greatest hit CD by the Blackbyrd.Lawrence"
1,Bad experience with this product,"This cellular battery is not for the Nokia N-80, I lost my money because I had now a battery what is less price and the bad quality."
1,What is this?,"I am looking for some additional arrows for my grandson. I've had to look all over this item to find how many arrows are included, I assume 3. Nowhere does it just state 3. How long are they? 22"", 24"", 26"", 32""? These are very very important questions! Yes? No? So, then I suppose at least one customer would address these issues or fill in the gaps. Nope! Well, there you have it!"
2,Not as fun as NBA Street,"I rented this to see how it compared to NBA Street. It is more realilistic, but no were near as fun. Rent both this and NBA street before you buy a basketball game."
4,short on charm,"The bracelet is nice but to short. It needs more length so that is can be shortened if need be but long enough to fit a larger wrist size. I was very disappointed in its length. The butterfly charm itself is nice and its overall appearance of both bracelet and charm is very good. The advertisment is for 7"" bracelet so larger wrist sizes beware. You can get extenders for the bracelet but they do take away from the appearance."
2,not worthy of Sebald,confused rambling.... Sebald was a great author this does not do him justice. Reread his books rather tan waste time on this over arty flic
5,A classic,This brings back great memories from my childhood at this time of year - can't wait to share it with my own kids.
4,Charlie Brown,At this very moment I am playing this CD for my holiday party here at work (I have to answer the phones and can't leave my station) and people are stopping dead in their tracks asking where I got this soundtrack. You can't help but smile when you hear this. Nothing says Christmas like Charlie Brown. Every song brings the scenes of the Christmas Special to mind. You won't regret getting this. A great way to introduce kids to jazz!!
5,A great selection of Christmas music for everyone!,"This is a great listening selection for the family, even at dinnerfor Christmas. Vince Guaraldi Trio has a unique FUN style thateven your youngest listening members will enjoy thoroughly, hardto believe this is from 1988...as it is still a favorite in 2011!An EXCELLENT price also and fast Amazon.com shipping."
4,"""Christmas Is Coming"".","This cd needs not a long review. Whether it's for the traditional pieces, or the songs from the show, this is a must for fans of ""Vince Guaraldi"", ""Charlie Brown"", and Christmas. It's one of the best ways to stay 9 years old forever."
4,holiday music,Done as the Comic Stip characters have for a long time. In the style well loved by all Charlie Brown fans of all ages. Christmas isn't Christmas without this CD!
3,Seasonal memory lane.,"This was ""free"" bonus and my first foray into downloading music. This is ""comfort"" music for me, as for most of my generation, but something I'm not likely to listen to at other times. Basically, it was the only free offering under the bonus that had any appeal to me.Had to start with something and this is music I enjoy..."
4,"Nostalgic, easy listening","Most people purchasing this soundtrack are likely fans of A Charlie Brown Christmas, as I am myself. However, even fans of relaxing piano jazz would probably like listening to the Vince Guaraldi Trio. There are a few, mildly tiresome tracks of children singing slightly off-key.Considering that this is a remastered edition, I was a little surprised at the background ""record album"" hiss on the tracks. In the end, though, the hiss gives a little bit of oldies character, and I don't mind it much."
5,Incredible Pressing,"I bought the remastered reissue of this on cd a couple of years back and it sounds great. This green vinyl pressing puts it to shame. The presence and enormous sound stage leaves me in awe. The vinyl is super silent which adds to the effect. Made buying this for the third time(2cd & 1 record) very worth it. Highly recommended & it,s GREEN!"
5,For children young and old...`,"What a great holiday cd, from the packaging to the music....great to listen to any time of year."
4,Charlie Brown Christmas,Children Loved this CD so did my mom very soothing sounds brought back memories of Christmas past shipped quickly also!!
3,Get the SACD instead.,"Like others have said, if you're used to hearing the original album this one is going to sound a little weird. Also, I don't think the sonics are really an improvement over the original CD.Get the SACD if you have the hardware, it is the best version by far. I played it side by side with this CD and there is no comparison."
5,Charlie Brown Christmas Album,The remastered version is very nice. It can really put one in the Christmas mood. The story just pops into your head.
5,A Charlie Brown Christmas CD,"I looked forward to The Charlie Brown Christmas Special every year growing up. I enjoyed the music, but I did not appreciate it until I became an adult. This is truly a fantastic CD to be enjoyed by everyone, young or old."
3,It is ok,There are quite a few songs that are repeated in different versions on this cd. I also have the newer cd of Charlie Brown Xmas songs and I didn't really need this in end as the newer one has all the songs from the older one and more.
2,Poor reproduction,"While I love this soundtrack, I was hoping to get a good quality recording. Instead, this was like listening to a scratchy old cassette tape or an L.P. Very poor sound quality for this CD."
1,Brutal training for canines,"Having a second lab 12 years later, thought it was time for a refresher. Asked my spouse to pick up a book and WOW... Can't believe the techniques the author considers HUMANE. Pulley & chain, stings between toes, pressure on ears, electronic collars, etc. 5 minutes. Book in trash. No idea how these trainers sleep at night."
1,Compartibility,"I have played this game before, so I thought I should get a copy for myself. However, the disappointment is that it is not compatible with 64 bit, and this was not stated in the product description. I have tried clicking on the link ""Connect to Webpage"" and all I get is an error message. Is there a way of downloading it on 64 bit?"
1,Good game,I used to love this game... and probably still would IF I could get it to play on my MacBook Air. Make sure you check the requirements before buying.
5,A Pleasure to Read. A+++++,The author has an amazing ability to place the reader in stories that he wrote. He uses powerful yet simplistic words that he uses to get his point across in a cynical yet comicial way. Every person who reads it will get something different out of it. A book everybody should own.
5,I love it,A complete set with serving chargers and flatware. It looks absolutely beautiful on the table and well worth the price.
3,Good dinnerware,"I received my order with one mug broken but Amazon promptly replaced it with a new shipment. The dinnerware is good for casual dinner parties---but beware that although they are dishwasher safe, they are not microwaveable. The charger appears to be plastic with gold paint on it which is a bit cheap but since it is not used for actual dining, it's alright. It's good for those starting out a dinnerware set but does not want to spend too much on casual company."
1,Do NOT buy!,Blue Juice is a horrible product if you want your trumpet or other brass instrument to last do not but Blue Juice. Blue Juice leaves behind a residue in all your Valves/Slides. Some music stores promote it but it honestly is not worth the buy if you want a great valve oil I highly recommend Al Cass Valve Oil which lubricates valves perfectly while Blue Juice has to be reapplied each time you get out your horn Al Cass lasts for a very long time with no side effects.
2,Hard,"It's very slow, and takes a long time. If you don't know about Star Trek, it would be hard to design a starship."
2,It creates nothing,"I bought this product with the intent of being an interactive game. Instead, you just watch the screen for what seems an eternity seeing this little blip of a starship that you had just created reach its final destination point. There is no action at all. Very boring just watching the screen and doing nothing. After the first week, I was board after creating the starship you choose. And there very few missions to pick from. Thumbs down."
5,Fi Fi is back in town,My lovely wife looks great in this outfit and she enjoys wearing it for my benefit. Definitely a good choice for a gift.
4,Soulful disco,"This is the most delectable, elegant disco music, better than most of today's House. Sylvester had a strong and expressive falsetto voice that is carried along on the most infectious dance beats. One could say he was the Smokey Robinson of the disco era. In the late 70s he was as popular as Donna Summer and ruled the dance charts with memorable tracks like the atmospheric Dance (Disco Heat), the rousing You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)and the soulful Stars. This album is not complete, as Sylvester had a couple of other hits too, like the brilliant Do You Wanna Funk and his version of the classic I Who Have Nothing. But this is still a satisfying collection of very melodic, hypnotic music that works well for listening and on the dancefloor."
1,bizarre and misguided,"This book is not only littered with appalling mistakes but a lot of non-sensical non-relevant clap-trap! What is most difficult to accept is the continued and unwelcome reference to God in every other paragraph! It's simply not relevant to understanding the actual chemistry and molecular make-up of these oils.What is also bizarre is the authors constant negative references to any other author or practitioner that has different opinions to him. It's absurd and seems a little unprofessional to be 'bad-mouthing' other nations techniques, such as the French and the British methods as well as his general distaste for the fragrance industry.I bought this book because others reviews that said it was unbiased and not 'airy-fairy', which is what I was looking for but it is exactly that. It concentrates far too heavily on therapeutic uses of the oils and in my opinion to much Biblical reference."
1,didnt stay up,These didn't stay up as advertised. kept rolling down resulting in me hoisting them up involved and over and getting snags after an hour's use. Cheap thin and won't stay up alone. $8 worth of garbage.
2,Not Thrilled.....,"The best suet in this assortment is the apple suet, but there were only two packages of it in the box. The others are very ordinary -- the same kind of stuff I can pick up for less in Wal-Mart. The birds know the difference!"
4,well......,"The sleeve came in excellent condition. The record itself had a ton of problems, with constant loud pops, cracks, and infrequent but somewhat serious skips. Overall, I cant expect a rare album such as this to be perfect, so I guess it's fine"
5,jazz for everyone,"Vince Guaraldi, though hardly mentioned in the same breath as Ellington, T. Monk, Oscar Peterson, and other piano jazz giants, is simply amazing. When they talk about ""listenable"" jazz, they mean Guaraldi. There's a reason why he got to write the soundtracks for Charlie Brown and Co. His sense of melody and timing is delicious, his phrasing never gets old, and he never loses you. I thought about purchasing his greatest hits CD until I realized that every Guaraldi CD plays like a greatest hits collection! This collection is particularly upbeat and I can listen to it any time, any place, and it always sounds good."
5,All The Right Ingredients,"This tale of young friendship, threatened 25 years after an initiation rite goes tragically wrong, quickly becomes a humdinger of a mystery with all the right ingredients -- trust and perfidy, suspicion and accusation, supposition and logic, violence and murder, with clues strewn along the way which do nothing to spoil the surprise ending. Weyman Jones has strayed somewhat from his roots as the author of young-adult novels -- and has pulled it off. A great read."
3,Not what I expected,"I was hoping this was the version of Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego that I had previously owned. But nope, this version sucks rocks."
4,Great family fun,My son and I played this together. He is only six and was able to follow along and when he needed help I was there. It was great to learn about geography without it being a text book. He really enjoyed and didn't want the game to end.
5,A wonderful book!,This is a really good book.It potrays a web of emotions.It shows the deep wonderful relationship between a father and a daughter which they are both afraid of losing as she unleashes a deep dark secret about his past life.. It shows the true friendship between Terri and Shaundra as Terri struggles through the most difficult year of her life... Most importantly it shows the strong bond between a mother and a daughter inspite of being separated for a long time and losing the hope of ever seeing each other again...
4,Nice gift,"I received this as a Christmas gift from my husband. I had asked for one years ago, remembering watching one that my parents had. I've enjoyed watching it daily. Nice gift!"
3,Lots of sizzle...not alot of emotion.,"Kat Martin is one of my favorite romance authors. She can always be counted on to be a little sexier than other authors. This book did not disappoint in that regard - there was alot of sizzle. However, I did not feel alot of emotion between these two characters.Alexa betrayed Damien terribly. If she really loved him, she would have confronted him with her accusations instead of betraying his trust (and blowing his cover). She never really learns to trust him and it really got annoying after a while. I get annoyed with all of the political intrigue in romance novels, too. I know they are trying to put an interesting twist on romance, but it just bores me to tears.This book is not reflective of Kat Martin's usual style. If you are new to her writing, check out some of her other books."
5,Sizzzling rhythm & blues 50's doo wop from Harlem,"This cd(the 2nd in a series of 2) is an exellent way to get introduced to early 50's doo wop music. This cd has 18 exellent selections of rhythm & blues drenched Doo Wop from the Big Apple(namely Harlem), all of them are black groups that sound closer to sizzling r&b burners rather than the later sappy doo wop that dominated the 60's. This is the r&b/jazzier, more rhythmic less commercial brand of doo wop, it is mostly gentle, yet swinging. There is a smokey sound here, honking saxaphones, and sensious sounds, and these are not the same songs recycled on other comps. This is a great cd of r&b doo wop. This is the finest doo wop set I've seen, and you can't beat the price."
1,Does not self prime,"If you need a pump that is self priming, do not get this. It will not self prime even 2 inches above the water level. Woks okay once going, but was a waste of money for what I needed it for."
4,Lots of value in this toy!,"Second only to the Little People Farm, this toy is a favorite of my 15 month old! It's easy to use, durable, well-priced, and has a lot of educational value. Because of this toy, my daughter knows the names of the zoo animals and the sounds they make (a seal says orr orr orr, and a monkey says ooh ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh). This can be helpful to parents like us who have no clue what sounds a seal makes! The only things I don't like about this toy are 1) the monkey is attached to his tree and doesn't come off; and 2) the polar bear makes a splashing-in-the-water sound and I think that can be confusing to a child when all of the other animals make a real animal sounds. Other than that, this is a great toy!"
5,Educational Fun,"I have already had 2 friends with toddlers ask where I got this one so that they, too, could purchase it for their children. My 2-year-old daughter loves hearing the different animal sounds and is learning the names and noises of the different animals. She also loves how the fences and animals are so versatile so that she can arrange and re-arrange for hours of educational play."
4,"So far, so good","I work in Information Technology, but I'm not a professional graphic designer or web front-end person. Outside of my primary business, I maintain a few websites for charities and small businesses. I had been using Dreamweaver and Fireworks on Windows for years and recently moved to a Mac.Studio 8 for the Mac has been great so far. The install was seamless (note - you do need the license key for your old version and you need to ""deactivate"" it if your old PC is still running). I have only spent time with Dreamweaver and Fireworks and they are both great on OS X. Unfortunately, I haven't had time to play with Flash, Contribute, or FlashPaper yet."
5,Heart Connection,"This is an excellent film, not only in the writing, editing and production but also in the clarity with which Peter's teachings are presented. The other aspect that struck me so profoundly is that I have been so much more present in a calm way, feeling and noticing how the feelings are in my body. Noticing that I am selective with listening to music now, instead of having music play all day at work but not enjoying or feeling it. Now I turn it off and when I have it on I hear and feel the magical sounds of Mozart. Once again enjoying the silence, less fearful of allowing this process to happen as the ego has a smaller and smaller voice maybe. Peter's words and your beautiful, clear, uncluttered examples have made an indelible impression on my heart. Thank you Peter."
4,Olivia Makes Her Own Luck,"I enjoyed this book, although I read sections over a long period of time. It could have used a bit of trimming; there are many plotlines including one about her rat of a husband who leaves her in the middle of a home renovation for a surprising reason that is revealed near the end of the book; one that tackles the complicated relationship she has with her mother; a storyline about a pregnant friend; and some werid goings on with the handymen camped out on her property, but all are filled with humor.I loved the characters, especially Olivia and her eccentic neighbors, one of whom she mistakenly thinks tried to kidnapped her daughter. The reader is made to wonder just who will win her heart, the neighbor who composes beautiful music, a handsome and sexy handyman or her husband who doesn't seem to know what he wants."
5,Perfectos para pintar,"La calidad de estos mezcladores es excelente, Tamiya siempre ofrece productos de primera calidad, 100% recomendable. Basta de usar palitos común y corrientes."
3,Decent line winder until the wind picks up.,"As soon as my kite got up in the wind, the winder stripped the gears and let out all my line. When I pressed the button to stop the line, it broke even further. This winder would work great if there was absolutely no wind, but then again kites are supposed to be flown on semi-windy days. It winds the line in great, once the kite is on the ground, but any pressure from the air while turning the crank will strip the plastic gears iside it. Over all, I was displeasd with this product."
4,"purchased new, but line was apparently cut and knotted","When I used the winder for the first time I noticed about 25 feet into unwinding, that the line had a knot in it! Apparently the knot held 2 ends together. I have only let out about 100 feet of the 500-feet line and do not know the quality of the remaining line. However, a new winder should consist of 1 continuous line. I feel like I have been cheated and I will proceed to have this winder exchanged.I do like the winder itself; the handle makes it easy to hold, and the line can be locked in place when you just want to watch the wind play with your kite.Update on 4/7/2004: Upon E-mailing AMAZON with my concern, I soon received confirmation that a new winder had been ordered for me. I also received simple instructions to return the first winder postage-free. I am inpressed with the customer service.In the meanwhile I can say that the line on this winder is of good quality; it can withstand pretty tough winds without ripping."
1,OUCH!!!!!,"If there is anything but a gentle breeze this will hurt your hands when you try the wind the kite in. Children cannot use it at all. If there is a real wind, you might as well cut the line on your kite because you cannot wind it in."
1,Will not hold an adult without turning over. fine for a child.,I was disappointed in this float. It does not hold an adult. It flips very easily and is not comfortable. My small son can fit into it and float... but if you are over 3 feet... don't bother with it. Very disappointed.... especially considering the price.
3,Not quite big enough for me,"I don't know how tall the girl is in the photo of the Swimline Lounge Chair, but I am 6 ft., and it ends about at my knees. Other than that, the product is generally comfortable. The reclined pillow back was nice, but unlike the photo of the girl laying on it, I slid down, which may be why it was so short for me. I used a generic DC pump to blow it up, and that was pretty easy to do. This matress was kind of an experiment, and I used it in a river, not in a pool. Compared to an inner tube, it was narrow, so I had to be careful to keep my balance."
4,Beautiful Story & Animation,"A very enjoyable film - good story line, elegant music, creative animation. The clay animation somewhat reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace & Grommit series. I really enjoyed it and so did my six and two&half year olds. The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because I feel the produces could have done a better job pronouncing the Russian names correctly. I feel it would have added so much more authenticity to the whole production. Otherwise it is super enjoyable."
5,Perfect for sleep-overs at Grandma's.,"Cute, comfortable, and neat handle for a small child to carry pillow when going to Grandma's house. Perfect ""bed"" friend when sleeping somewhere other than home. Also great for the car"
4,Great cd,Sampled this cd on Amazon and knew I had to have it. the atmosphere of the music is mostly ambient in nature but pure genius in it's rythems. It goes from subtle to intense. I especially like disc 2 - it's more contemplative and I love strange synthesized music anyway. At times I can feel what must be a tortured soul in the artist's expression of himself. After learning about his early years I can understand more about the music and can appreciate it better.
3,Authoritative but not an easy read,"This is an authoritative text (it's on the recommended reading list for the CMA, for example). Unfortunately, the style of writing is not the clearest. Although I'm a straight-A student of accounting, I had to re-read way too many sentences."
4,quite excellent,"I came about Faultline by mere chance. I just listened to two excerpts from this album & bought it right there without bothering to listen to the rest. This album is excellent & will appeal to many from a wide spectrum of tastes. It features vocals by Coldplay's chris martin & R.E.M's michael stipe. The songs are mellow & moving, very well produced by kosten too."
3,"Birdie Putt Rimmed Out--A Par, But a Good Par (Ain't No Bad Par!!!)","Good story (stories) that need to be remembered, chronicled to preserve the history of golf and golf's geatest tournament...but something seems to be lacking, missing.The stories are well-told and interesting, even fascinating at times, but they lack character and indepth personality, a ""flesh and blood-ness"" that carries the reader into the heart and soul of the men being written about. The book is about characters and personalities, but we never seem to get to know them, just read about them.. We know about the caddies and we know their stories, but we never feel like we know them.There are no bad pars, as stated in the review title. This book, while good, is a near-miss birdie. Read it anyway!!! It's about a group of men who contributed greatly to the legend, lore and tradition of The Masters. That alone makes it worth reading if you are a golf fan."
1,shades melted and cracked,this thing says you can put a 60 watt incandescent bulb in. more like a 5 watt bulb. the heat from a 60 watt bulb discolored 3 out of the 5 shades and those 3 also have cracks in the plastic from the heat. one of the shades broke in half just by touching it. im surprised this lamp was not recalled due to the shades melting and breaking. its a safety issue. the only way this thing is safe is if you use those compact florescent lights as they don't get as hot.
2,OK for beginners,"I bought this book with high expectations from the author. I have gone through all his books and found them great and handy. This, however, departs a little from there. Though I would definitely recommend this book for one who is about to explore SQL Server. There are a few errors, as well as some syntax given refers back to the earlier version, I noticed."
5,Passionate and full of longing ...,"The English Patient is one of my favourite movies, but the reason why I love the movie is also because of the deeply introspective music. I was introduced to Marta Sebestyen and Gabriel Yared through this movie. Listening to Sebestyen's ""Szerelem, Szerelem"" and the songs from the CD would create a deep longing to be with your loved one ...When you're lonely and you need a company, invite Mr Yared and Ms Sebestyen along! This CD is a must ..."
1,Didn't work for us,"I don't know if I got a defective unit, but my experience is vastly different than the other reviewer's. I could barely get the machine to produce any shavings at all."
4,Nice!,I have never had an Andis product before and I am very pleased. The comb attachment is great and my hair dries smooth and soft!
1,The dryer will damage acquired a month,"The dryer stopped working the first month of purchased, simply connect as normal in a 110v socket normally used, and did not turn over. try connecting the other parts of the house and likewise does not work anymore."
1,Very dangerous product - do not buy.,"My wife has been using this hair dryer for about a year now with no problems until today, when the dryer motor exploded in her hands and she was nearly electrocuted when she tried to unplug it. Reading some of the other reviews, I see that she was very lucky - the casing remained intact and the tiny sharp pieces of the motor remained inside the unit rather than turning into dangerous shrapnel. The Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer is a poorly-designed, dangerous product that should be taken off the market."
2,A Book of Contradictions and Non-Answers,"What I liked about this book is that it makes use of documents and materials from both the West and the Communist World. It is an interesting mix and a fair look at both sides of the Cold War. But there is the problem as well. Too much of the book and the evidence from both the US and USSR at times contradict each other, while at other times supports each other. In short, the chapters are confusing. Who is right? Who is wrong? For example their Cuban Missile Crisis chapters where interesting, but heck if I can draw a conclusion as to what really happened. Also, the title. The title is wrong. It is clear that the US and the West one the cold war. I think that is an undisputed fact. So again, the book has good information, but it is at times too much. The book is ultimately too much info and not enough conclusions."
3,Antenna Upgrade,I ordered a 6 pack of antenna upgrades from Accessory Export and my phone Needed THREE of them to just hold on to the signal at my house. The shipping was Slow and expensive. I don't know why they don't use use Standard Mail.
1,don't work,The device is cheaply made and showed no signs of increasing the signal strength. The product does not work as described.
1,Beware of shipping charge!,The price is decepive at best. There is nothing on this page that says the shipping charge will be $6.45!
1,Don't waste your time!,"There isn't much to say, you get what you pay for... sometimes a bit less... In this case it was less. Theses things don't work. Save yourself the time and pass this product up. Shipping was fast and I did get everything promised but... the product is garbage."
5,Awesome book! Exciting! Riveting! GET IT!,"I probably sound like a paid endorser, but the truth is, this book is fantastic. It's written beautifully, contains riveting stories, and is packed with insights, ideas, trends, and more. It's written for anyone in business ready to cash in on the future. Wireless is the next big trend. This book shows you how to surf it to the bank. Get it. Get it right now. -- Joe Vitale, author of way too many books to list here, ..."
4,Starship Titanic,"This game is really cool! This is only the second computer game that I have enjoyed, the first being King's Quest 7: The Princeless Bride. The navigation took a little while to get used to, but once I got the hang of it, it was fine. The graphics are superb and the music is good, as well. I really liked talking to the robots, although their conversation was limited. Some of the puzzles were rather difficult, but if they were all easy, the game would be over too soon."
1,Not worth the money,"At first I thought that this would be a fun game. After a while, it got very tiresome and the parrot was so annoying. I found a few of the puzzles almost impossible to solve, and ended up needing 2 spoilers. The graphics are OK, but it doesn't hold a candle to Myst or Riven. Overall, if you have nothing better to do with your money, and have nothing else to play, then go for it. But if you want something REALLY good, you haven't found it yet."
1,BAD BAD BAD...,Ok I got Fungi-Cure Anti Fungal Liquid because it says cures ringworm. Ok...BURNS like the Devil stepped out of Hell and sat on my chest.The ringworm was on my neck.Had to take a shower to scrub it and it still burns.Not sure how it feels on toes but ringworms.BAD BAD.Think If I used Googles reviews of Bleach may not of burnt so bad.lol.Heading to Dr's for this.
1,Did NOT see any improvement,I have been using this daily after my shower for 3 months and have not seen any improvement as of yet. I have been on lamisil twice (3yrs apart) and it did not work either. So I might just have a really tough case. I am considering laser treatment.
2,Too thin!,"The costume was too thin and the fit of it ran small. I ordered the correct size, but it was tight and small. The material was very cheaply made."
2,Short-sighted analysis of real life negotiation theories,"A throwback to rather ""medieval"" thinking; Churchman does little to advance an understanding of the collabrative processes that produce truly successful negotations. The text is nothing more than a compendium of archaic principles of early negotiation science."
3,Disappointing,"Although put out by a reputable kite manufacturer this attractive and fun-looking reel has serious problems.I bought this to make kite flying more fun for my kids. Stocked with 50 lb line, it could handle any kite my kids wanted to fly. It has a reel lock to prevent line from constantly spooling out. But actually using this reel is harder than it should be.The problem lies in what happens if you are reeling in line that is slack and not taut. If you do that, the line has a tendency to slip over the end of the reel and around the axil. This is usually not a problem with most reels but as the spool on this one is completely encased, there is no simple way to realign the line. Luckily the case can be opened by removing a pair of screws but that is not something you are going to want to have to deal with when you are in the field trying to have fun.However, if you can keep the line taut while reeling it in, this actually is a fun and versatile little reel."
5,"Great variety, great illustrations and easy-to-follow recipe","James McNair's South East Asian cook book has a great selection of recipes from countries like Malaysia, Thailand,and Vietnam among others. The illustrations in the book are beautiful. Recipe's are easy to follow and very helpful. There are sections on the basics of South East Asian cooking, shopping guide for ingredients and useful equivalency tables. Each recipe is also preceded by a synopsis of the background of the dish. I highly recommend the book!"
1,Cooked Rival Customer,"I purchased two of the 20 quart Rival cookers, one for myself and one for other family members in the Fall of 2002. It appears both units suffered a failure when cooking- they simply stoppped heating in less than 12 months after the purchase.Upon contacting Rival they offered to repair the units at $20.00 plus any shipping costs we would incur to get it there. This was hardly worth the time or money. The reason I write this review is to alert other consumers that this unit appears to be junk, though it worked well prior to the failure. Each product failed within a year of purchase... ironically within the same family. Sure, that's less than a scientific sampling- but its plenty of data for me.I totally agree with the concept of using such a device but would highly recommend consumers look for better quality. I regret my price driven purchase."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"While I do agree with some of the author's insights, the book for the most part doesn't live up to his own stated goals in the introduction: to tell the ""why"" of The Beatles phenomenon as opposed to the ""what"". Mr. Stark definitely wastes far more paper on the latter rather than the former.After reading halfway through the book I am exhausted by the too many instances of over-indulgent and sloppy writing (Donovan's ""Catch The Wind"" a protest song?, ""Anytime At All"" is a dark and honest song?, ""She's A Woman"" displays rock's traditional attitude to women?, etc., etc.) and faulty fact-checking.I've said it before in my other reviews and I will keep saying it: the book publishing industry desparately needs more editors."
2,Small and cheap USB flash has drawbacks,"This thing takes about 10 mins+ to copy a 100meg folder of 200kb files! When you first open up the drive it takes a long time to load the directory structure. The manufacturer claims that this drive can write at 3.5mb/sec (very slow for USB 2.0) -- it might peak at that speed for moving large files (like a movie) but the performance drops a lot for smaller files (like photos).If you are planning on getting one of these, it is a tiny little archive that you can stuff into your change pouch or wallet. I use it to store little Excel and Powerpoint files or some PDFs. I would not use this to share photo albums or home videos, it's much too slow for that."
1,Do Not Last Long,"I bought this so I could put it into my wallet and it was perfect for that. It did, however, end up not working in roughly two weeks. Not worth it. Enough said."
5,Great for SAT prep,"I bought this for my daughter to augment her SAT Prep. Since she drives all the time, it was great for her to listen to the words in the car. I will use it for my other children as well."
5,For parents around the world,"With online poker growing in popularity around the world, this is a must read for anyone with a young person in their care who is spending time and money on poker. Loren writes from the heart with ideas on how to manage the player's interest in a safe and constructive way. Using examples from her relationship with her son, poker-player, Chris they demonstrate on the page how it is possible for parents and their players to communicate effectively and to understand what is happening from the other's point of view."
4,An Old Right Winger Remembers,"I'm an old right winger now, but I remember back in the 60's in my ""hippy daze"" in Pittsburgh when I discovered the Fugs. The innocence and irreverence of it all. I couldn't help but to buy the CD. The moldy album is in the basement somewhere. Good times and lost loves remembered. Loved the added Tuli cut ""Defeated"". Don't know why it didn't make the final album cut. Paradise Lost....."
4,Like lesbian candy,"Nothing better than a woman discovering she's a lesbian! Perhaps I'm biased in this respect, but this book has a lot of great stories of women's first awakenings into the lesbo life. A great read!Verge"
1,Boring,"Very boring read, not entertaining. A waste of good money. Don't waste yours like I wasted mines."
3,Valuable but very dated,"I first read the Tale of Genji and became fascinated by the Heian time period and I recently reread this book because I wanted to know more about it. Morris does a really good job of defining and describing the government and other functions that are necessary for understanding the Heian times and the Tale of Genji. Unfortunately, I found this book to be extremely dated in its outlook. There's an implicit understanding of how very exotic and strange these funny Japanese people were. While this may have been and still may be acceptable in some circles, I found that it hindered my understanding of the times and my empathy with the characters in the Tale of Genji and also the historical figures today. It's too bad that Morris wasn't able to step away from his time and see the Heian Japanese as real people not just strange exotics."
1,"Never worked well, then fell to pieces","I was very disappointed with this product. Despite following the directions precisely, the iron never steamed at all. It did work for dry ironing. Then a few months later I was packing it for another trip, and found that as I attempted to slip the soleplate cover on just to see if perhaps NOW the steam part would work, it broke into 3 pieces. I would certainly not purchase this product again."
2,"Fine... before it breaks,,, again...","This is a fine product and used to be made better. But when my old school rowenta steamer broke and i bought this one that plastic guard with the brush broke off again and again, finally, beyond repair, so i bought another one, and the same thing happened. There is no quality left to the build of this product and I'll be finding another brand or another model."
5,Loved it,"Summarizing the political, social, and infrastructural development of the C.S.A., I found the Confederate Nation fascinating and engaging. I particularly enjoyed how the book used the life of Edmund Ruffin as a bookend for the Confederate experience. A well written piece of american history. Highly recommended."
5,The Reason I Bought GBA,The reason I bought GBA. This game is part of the saga to end all sagas. I love every part of the Ogre Battle/Tacttics Ogre saga and they all were GREAT. Also Atlus is a Wonderful RPG/SIM game maker. So buy Tactics Ogre for GBA and check out the other great games made by Atlus
