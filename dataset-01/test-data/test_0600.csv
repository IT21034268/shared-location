5,Great game!,Lots of fun. I enjoyed it. I know it has had some bad reviews but I'm not really sure why. Five stars all around!
4,Wonderful music!,"The biggest drawback to an otherwise outstanding presentation of this work is the abridgement of a good deal of the music, so that some of the most delightful numbers get cut short and lack their second verses. But what music! And the singing here is mostly all superb. And since DVDs of this enchanting work are not exactly growing on trees, this is certainly worth one's time and will undoubtedly give much pleasure."
2,Headliners II,"I've been trying to diversify my collection by getting this compilation full of rock. Sadly enough there are only four tracks I listen to. Unwritten Law's ""Cailin"", Melissa Etheridge's ""My Lover"", Tonic's ""Future Says Run"" and Method Of Mayhem's ""Hypocritical"". Maybe for full bled rock lovers this will do, but for a person, like myself, this is too many fillers and not hard ass rock songs."
2,not enough deep,"I was disappointed in the paucity of photos of the ""deep"" There was at least the same amount of shark and squid reporting as fish. I'm returning this book and ordering another that I hope will have more photos of all the wonderful biolumenescens that is in the deep ocean."
4,A truthful representation of life in Soviet Union in the 80s,"Without any exaggeration this movie portrays the family of four women, all crammed up in a tiny apartment. They all have their own problems and hardships but still manage to love and support each other.To me this is a funny and dramatic tale, which managed to touch many aspects of soviet lifestyle in general and the place of soviet women in the society...Scary moments of the movie came from flashbacks that the invalid grandmother is having. They revealed the truth about the Stalin's regime and dark secrets about the woman herself.This movie is both funny and sad. I would highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning more about life in the former Soviet Union. I should know - I lived there until 1993..."
5,"Great Book, Get it","I had lots of fun reading this book, the illustrations are great. I have been fishing for a couple of years, but learned a lot form this book. This is a must have if you are new to fishing. Ps. it only takes a couple of hours to read the whole book."
2,"Not very good for beginners, seems outdated","I just began fishing. I purchased this book at a great price and in excellent condition from Amazon, but was not impressed by the contents. The diagrams are confusing and the material just seems outdated. This did not help me at all learning to fish."
2,Impossible to set up without damage,"I was very disappointed in this screenhouse, especially considering all the positive reviews for Paha Que products. We tried to set it up in the backyard but it was virtually impossible without tearing the no-see-um, ripping the seams, or bending the poles, and we precisely followed the instructions provided. We gave up on it, and we are experienced tent putter-uppers. Back it goes to Amazon.Maybe the one we received was defective? There was a lot of excess string/cloth hanging out at all the seams, like the panels weren't run through the sewing machine correctly. Also, though I like the idea of the Velcro at the bottom of the tent to hold down the rain panels, as we were packing it back up the Velcro easily snagged on the netting, making a mess of it."
2,Not completely satisfied,"I ordered 2 of these bulbs, copied numbers completely from the one that was hanging in the socket. This was NOT a mistake. After arriving, I made sure that this is the exact same bulb that I had in use. The numbers match but the bulb is yellow? Why is that? For this I cannot give good ratings"
2,"Proprietary light bulb is not consistent, color is wrong (and ugly)","We bought two light fixtures that use these bulbs when we remodeled our house a few years ago. One of the bulbs recently burned out, we went to the local hardware store and found one that looks pretty much the same and is also a ""T6"" light but it did not fit in our fixture because of clearance issues. I was able to find the ""correct"" part on Amazon (much more expensive than that was at the store) but when it arrived it was a completely different color than the original lamp (new one is very yellow).For the future we will be careful when buying light fixture to ONLY buy ones that use standard bulbs."
1,Two thumbs down,"The first time I used this battery the red ""your battery is dying"" light came on after I had taken maybe a dozen pictures and less than 20 minutes after I powered up the camera. Since I didn't use this battery until after the 30 day return period I couldn't return it to Amazon and I couldn't get a replacement from Panasonic despite a lengthy call to Panasonic Customer Service. So one moral of the story is to use the new battery immediately and keep using it until it runs down (which may take no time at all). And since I paid full price for this battery simply because it was the name brand, the second lesson is, buy the cheap batteries. Can they be any worse?"
4,Another solid Miyazaki flick.,"Porco Rosso (Hayao Miyazaki, 1992)In between his two monolithic environmentalist efforts, Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki enjoyed his greatest artistic success as a filmmaker, in my opinion. (Cue legions of Spirited Away fans who disagree.) Not only his best picture, Kiki's Delivery Service, but My Neighbor Totoro and Porco Rosso were also produced during this time. That's a trifecta of which any director could be proud.Porco Rosso tells the story of, not surprisingly, the Crimson Pig, a 1920s pilot with a dark past. After a mishap, he takes his plane to get it repaired in Italy, where he's wanted by the army. They find out he's home, and the hijinks begin.It's actually quite simple and straightforward for a Miyazaki film, which was something of a surprise. A good old swashbuckling adventure flick about daredevil flyers, honor, and friendship. Think of it as Wings: The Animated Version and you won't be too far wrong. ***"
3,Mediocre.,"Someof the elements in this movie have that Studio Ghibli magical touch, but most of it is too ""real"" for me to enjoy. Yeah, the guy's a pic and that's ""magical"", but that's about it. Too many flying scenes as well."
5,A classic fairy tale,"I stumbled upon this story whilst reading Andrew Lang's collection ""The Violet Fairy Book"" and fell in love with it. Imagine how pleased I was to discover that Wilhelm Hauff's awesome story had also been translated by Doris Orgel AND illustrated by the great Maurice Sendak. Hauff died at a young age, but in Germany the tales he wrote are as famous as Grimm's. This is not only a great story, but it has the marvelous thing that the worst situations are what can makes us truly ourselves. It's cute, entertaining, and utterly imaginative at a level that not all other fairy tales are. Sendak's illustrations are of course wonderful as always. This is a little-known tale on our continent and I really do not think it should be that way."
1,"Yuck, I returned it!","Waste of time and money, if you want sea buckthorn products, buy sea buckthorn products! < supposed main ingredient in this stuff, yeah I don't think so."
1,Don't waste your money or time....,"This alleged ""book"" offers insights only a seriously impaired job hunter would find valuable. You won't learn anything about Head Hunters or the executive search industry. The ""chapters"" average 1 1/2 pages long -- no exaggeration. Geared to a third grade reading (and job hunting) level, you fully expect pictures and the words The End on the last page. Prepare to be disappointed. Enjoy gems of advice akin to 'Use your hand to shake hands at the beginning and end of an interview!' and 'Paper is a good material to use when creating a resume'. (These are not quotes from the book -- but I fully expect the author to try to steal them for use in his next ""book."")"
5,A gift from Kate,"Kate Taylor's ""Beautiful Road"" is, quite simply, a gift for anyone who enjoys good music. The songs range from folk to R&B, and Kate's voice is great, as always. Let's just hope she doesn't wait 20 years to make her next record."
3,PONDEROUS !,"Well researched but poorly executed. A prime example of turgid,abstruse,poorly organized scholastic writing that all too often characterized late 19th & early 20th centuries. As was pointed out in a previous review,some of this prolix style is a result of translation from the original German. Another difficulty is that of organizing large amounts of ethno religious myth data. This problem was addressed quite satisfactorily by J.M. Robertson in PAGAN CHRISTS (1909)who was another pioneering scholar of the MYTHACIST school of thought regarding christian origins. More recently, Aschyra S.(THE GREATEST STORY EVER SOLD) & Timothy Frecke (THE JESUS MYSTERIES) do a similarly effective examination of the non historicity of the jesus figure. That said,Drews made a powerful contribution that can't be discounted by any serious scholar seeking the truth & not simply a reinforcement of his religious delusions."
5,Get this book!,Get this book! My mom got it for me and I love it.It shows that the Backstreet Boys really care about their fans! The Backstreet Boys deserve to be #1 forever!
2,Jam-resistant? Right...,"Unlike the product description says, this stapler will jam even if less than 20 sheets are used @ 20 lb weight each. I tried only 15 and it jammed up again and again. The stapler feels solidly built, and it works great for stapling I would say 10 sheets or less. Just don't buy it for the jam-resistance, because the only thing it resisted in my experience using it was me."
2,"Feels ""dated"" an no longer relevant to me....","Honestly I'm surprised by most of the reviews I see here giving this book 5 stars. Most of the people in the book, I personally don't hold in the highest regard. They all seem ""past their prime"" and many sound like they are remeniscing on how it used to be. In terms of the books title ""Insider reveal their creative secrets."" .. I find this laughable. I've read through the entire book, and there are very few concrete, CLEAR ideas on how to improve your musical craft. If you're a person that likes to learn through explicit instruction, then this book is definitely not for you. If you simply want to read interviews from some semi-relevant people that were in the music biz at one time, then this book may be for you. I would highly recommend going to your local bookstore and scanning through a few pages before spending your money."
2,Not What I Expected,"Anatomy for the Artist was not what I was expecting. From reading the Amazon.com review, I was expecting to have my own life drawing studio in the privacy of my home. Instead, I received a book that reminded my of my college anatomy textbook. The photographs are very beautiful. However, I was expecting more photographic references so that I could have my very own life drawing studio. Perhaps, for the person that has never study human anatomy, this book will be helpful, but I found it boring. I tried to like the book, because it is so beautifully put together, but eventually had to return it."
2,"Pretty pictures, not much information","I was looking for a book that would give me real understanding of the way that muscles connect to bones and how they work in motion. This book doesn't do that, and some of the drawings of muscles are so stylized as to be almost useless -like the drawing of muscles of the shoulder on page 103, which seems to have been compressed vertically simply because it looks cooler that way.If you want a book that gives a brilliantly clear exposition of how muscles and bones work, Goldfinger's Human Anatomy for Artists is the best I've found. If you only want pretty pictures and sylish drawings this one is for you."
4,"Beautiful photos, could use more full body shots showing face","The photos and book are beautiful. I am happy with the book in that regard. Also it has a wealth of information necessary for a solid education in figure drawing. The transparent overlays of muscle over skeletal structure is great. I would have liked to have seen more full body shots, head to toe, with faces pointed towards the viewer. Really though, it is an invaluable addition to my artistic reference library."
4,Always precise and Drivers are Great,I've been using Logitech mice for 8 years now without a hitch and the Elite Duo is still excellent. The problem with Tracking or Skipping is ALWAYS attributed to the Transmitter location and it's very sensitive so you must experiment with location.Once you have it down you can use it from another room and Logitech always updates & perfects their drivers. I use an Elite Duo with my Older Mouseman PS2 Ball and a Keyboard Serial touchpad not to mention the extra PS2 keyboard and have 0 problems.Battery life could be better in the mouse but when you use it for 12h/7d/365 I guess it can be a problem. I use NIMH rechargeables and get about 3 weeks.PS: you can easily switch hands with this mouse if you're good too.
5,works perfect,"im very happy with my new keyboard and mouse. my old wired kb and mouse dont let me feel confortable when i wrote some homework or typing a text, now i can put kb and mouse everywhere . some times i dont need to be on my desk to type something. i can do it in the couch."
4,bad software,"1. the logitech mouseware cause the mouse jumpy. but if u do not install the logitech drivers, all works fine.2. No led for NumLock...3. Mouse a little heavy and a little big (battery?)4. I hate the ""User"" button on keyboard, it will cause your system sleep accidently."
3,It works at least.,"The cordless portion of this product set works fine most of the time although there has been a couple times I had to resynch it.The keyboard is rather clicky and annoying if you have to listen to someone else typing on it. It feels okay if you are typing on it yourself.I don't use the mouse anymore. I use a Logitech wireless trackball (which I love). A nice thing is that I could the their trackball with the keyboard/mouse receiver without adding a second receiver.The added control buttons are nice. I like the volume control wheel better than +/- buttons for volume.I thought I'd like the left hand wheel but in reality, I almost never use it.Overall, its fine but I'm not thrilled with it. I probably wouldn't buy it again but don't mind having it around."
1,Neither Precise Nor Accurate,"Farah's book describes a naive young girl who met the twice-divorced Shah in Paris near the height of his wealth and power. This must have been heady stuff. She describes her own life as rather shelered, and her life with the Shah was very sheltered. When they fled Iran, they had hundreds of millions of dollars, even though the Shah had grown up in poverty.Farah blames the horrible regime of the Islamic Republic for the overthrow of the Shah. It's true this government is a disaster for Iran. Farah doesn't mention any of the Shah's own shortcomings, however. He may have made some advancements for women's rights, but he was getting pressure from the West, since we put him in power. He maintained power through the military and was a dictator.Another reviewer mentioned the Falacci interview, and again in Falacci's book (available on Amazon) you can read the Shah's own words in which he says that ""men are superior to women"" and much more.This is not a balanced account."
1,A Wife's Story,"This book was a surprise. It details Farah's life with the Shah, and the difficultities they experienced getting his cancer treatment. In this book, Farah (and I noticed several reviewers below) is an apologist for the Shah, but does not give a balanced picture of the worst judicial system in the world in its time, and injustices committed on the civil liberties of Iranians."
1,Farah's Perspecitve,"Farah writes this book from the perspective of Carmela Soprano when she still defended Tony Soprano. Farah writes that the shah played with his children, but leaves out the part that he was a brutal dictator.While the current regime in Iran is an unmitigated disaster for human rights, the Shah's wasn't much better, but Farah doesn't even mention this.A reviewer below ludicrously compares the shah's rule to President Bush. Nothing could be further from the truth, because in the U.S. we have a balance of power between the elected executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch of government."
1,Censored Biography,I read this book with amazement. Is it possible that Farah so sheltered and blinded herself that she believes what she writes here? This book irresponsibly implies that the Shah was a good leader in Iran and that the Islamic republic overthrew him. The truth is that the Iranian people overthrew a dictator and chose an even worse government. Farah worked hard to avoid reading any accurate accounts of the Shah's regime. Perhaps she only read the heavily censored news accounts printed during his regime.
1,From Very BAd to Worse,Farah can't possibly believe what she wrote in this book. She'd have you believe the Shah was a good leader. Farah must not have heard President Bush mention the Shah was a dictator on par with Saddam Hussein. Sure the current government is worse. All that means is that Iran went from very bad to worse.
5,"Well Timed, Well Received & Genuine","Whether a supporter or a critic of the Pahlavi dynasty, one has to agree that politics aside, Farah Pahlavi's graceful and regal handling of a very painful and intricate period in her life is an example for many for us to follow.Once the first lady of Iran, she subsequently went through the painful process of losing her husband, moving from country to country in search of a safe home for the remainder of her family and more recently losing a daughter.As an Iranian, I feel that her tragic story is the story of our nation's and the almost never ending series of calamities that we all seem to have suffered over the past 25 years.It is a well written book which has become a best seller for a good reason, read it."
2,"value of book b4 purchase,in my words",This is a good book if your looking for a basic review of ww2 transcriptions and how they were laid out in the catagories...But I was looking for more of a complete directory not explain the catagory then give me a sample of 5-10 or so records that would be in that title??? But I do understand threw reviewing information in book alot of the record #s matrixs and contents were lost due to poor managment of gov. property... So I guess if this is it ????
5,mystery,Great book!! I totally reccomended great book the plot is great and the setting. I love Cam Jasen she is great
5,CAM JANSEN AND THE MYSTERY OF THE STOLEN DIAONDS,I LIKE THIS BOOK. BECAUSE CAM HAS A GOOD MEMEREY.SO HE HELPSSOLVE THE MYSTREY!
5,"This dvd was free through the mail from[...], I think a diffrent version is being established","I enjoyed this Vacation planning kit. I was lucky enough to go to disney World this past November and see all of the new shows and rides that were introduced this year. This dvd helped me choose what hotel to stay at, what rides to go on with my 3 year old daughter, and informative facts about the parks."
1,Beware of high expectations,"Ordered and took delivery at a price discounted. The article does not look like the item pictured, neither in color nor shape and size. The camera delivered looks like a 50 year old Kodak Brownie or Hawkeye--but Black color. The advertised model is silver gray in color and with a smooth modern appearance. I would consider returning this camera but its not worth the trouble nor the price."
1,awful sale,"I bought this camera through ebay, it was brand new, and when I decided to use it, the pictures quality was AWFUL !!!! On daylight it looks ""decent"" but the background always comes out blurry, you need to take pictures up close at least for like 4 inches so it can look ""good"" I suggest..save your money and buy yourself a better camera !"
1,USELESS,This does not take a picture worth viewing to the most inexperienced eye. I'd say it would be good for my 2 year old grandson but I think he'd like the play one that makes noise in the dollar store better. Do not waste your money. Too difficult to use for a child and the pictures are all trash anyway.
1,Never received it...,"I ordered this years ago, it never arrived but back then Amazon didn't have the customer service and features it has today to help you. So, since I never received it (even though Amazon's files say they sent it), I can't comment on it."
5,Good Buy and Value,"I really like this product. It came faster than I expected and was exactly what I was looking for. It is a good large size and flips and folds easily. If I ever need another, I'll come here."
1,Not really Mac-compatable...,"I have an older iMac with 2 USB ports and no PS2 ports. The receiver needs one USB port for the keyboard and one PS2 port for the mouse. That means only the keyboard can be used out-of-box. The iMac keyboard has 2 usb ports, one of which I use (as is common) for my mouse. This frees up my other USB port for my printer. Even if I hook up just the keyboard, I am left having to choose between my printer and my mouse or buying more hardware (a usb hub) to get just a cordless keyboard."
4,Good product - but be prepared to handle a heavy mouse!,"I trust Logitech for PC accessories like mouse, webcams and speakers. This one was a good product too. I bought this in 2004 and it is still working fine. The only disappointment I had was the weight of the mouse - when you insert 2 AA batteries into them, they become so heavy (especially if you are used to the lightweight USB corded optical mouses). So I stopped using the mouse and have been using just the keyboard.The customization keys (for yahoo/hotmail and other websites) haven't been of big help - may be the instructions weren't too user-friendly. So I ended up ignoring this feature.Very smooth to handle - not much noise while typing. I would recommend this product for those who don't care about the weight of the mouse - this is probably the best deal for you folks! And the price of this (~$30) hasn't changed for 2 years now!!"
4,Clear; easy to follow,"I found this book very helpful in taking myself from a Go idiot to someone who could at least feel somewhat competent in playing a game.I found the book well-organized, clear, step-by-step with helpful self-testing problems at the end of each chapter.One of the better beginning Go books I've looked at"
5,Well done,This book provided a lot of information from a period where that is hard to come by. Very detailed. I highly recommend it.
4,Good not great,"I received the item before the expected delivery date whichwas great. But as others stated the locking mechanism for the pin broke off, but with the badge holder I purchased it still stays on so not a big deal for me. It's a good badge but could be better, but, for $7.80 not a bad deal. It is true you do get what you pay for."
3,Good Product,"This is a professional looking, heavy metal badge. Fast shipping. Only issue was the little round clasp that locks the pin fell off. Had to re-attach."
4,Nice,"This book is decent for the price, it gives nice reference material. Just don't look for a lot of tips and strategies here, especially ones that haven't been tried already."
4,Good camera for the price until it broke 2 yrs later,"for 100 bucks, its a nice camera, but the other day the lens wouldnt come out. It was a great camera. I shot award winning pictures with it. But, then it broke. (PS. I am buying the A350 as a replacement)"
1,Died within a day!,"Got this from Amazon but it died within a day of shooting. The lens got stuck and won't go back in. It won't focus either although electronics part seemed working fine. Tried 3 sets of fully charged batteries and mutiple on/off cycles. Fuji tech support were of no further help.The build quality is very poor indeed. Basically you get what you pay for. I am glad it stopped working now, much better than if had happened middle of a vacation.Thanks to Amazon the return is easy and goodbye Fuji!"
5,What's not to like?,"I bought this camera for my teenage son, so if he looses it or breaks it I won't have to cash in his college fund. To get a 2 mpx camera with X3 optical zoom that works well for $99.00 is a bargin."
3,site information confusing,"the information in the site in paragraph PRODUCT DESCRIPTION says that the camera is comaptible with ""CP-FXA10 Picture Cradle"" and then further says that there is a ""picture cradle adapter"" included in the package, but the pakage has a plastic holder type thing and there is no adapter included in the normal package, so be careful while u order and do not expect an adapter with your order, as i have not got the same."
4,Great for 2.0 Megapixel. Also for a beginner.,"I bought this camera oddly enough, on ebay. I did not need a 5 or 7 megapixel camera. I just wanted to get rid of my film cameras. So I bought it and it works just fine. Has .3, 1 and 2 megapixel modes. Works fine for my use and I don't need to spend a lot of money just for a higher megapixel camera."
2,"comfort, background noise not acceptable","I owned this for a few weeks and found that it was a bit uncomfortable when wearing for more than a few minutes.Also, when using in the car, the person on the other end had a very hard time hearing me due to all the background noise (even with the windows closed and radio off, of course).I do, however, like the little battery charger and clip that comes with it -- it made it easier to carry around (ie. you could clip it to your briefcase, belt, or phone holder).I sold it at auction and bought the 510, and it seems a bit more comfortable, and also produces less background noise in the car. however its a bit bulkier."
4,Good value if you aren't looking for perfection,"For the price, this is a great bluetooth headset. It has all the features I need it to, easily syncs with my devices, and gets the job done. It's not the best one out there, but you usually get what you pay for. My only complaint might be if it's in my ear and I'm working and bending over or something it can have a lot of static. I'm not sure why but it always seems to be when my head is bent down towards the ground. I think the ear gel thing could be a little better too, but overall it stays in so it's fine. I have had mine drop a few calls, but for the most part it isn't an issue, and I think in the past I've had cell phones do it just as much anyway. On the whole, this is a great value for the price and if you're looking for an affordable headset that's still decent quality I definitely recommend this one."
4,Discovery 640E,This is the best hands-free device that I've owned. This is a replacement for a Plantronics 320. It's much lighter and doesn't irritate my ear.
4,"Device A+, battery option F","This device is wonderful; nice and clear, lightweight and confortable (you get to pick among 3 sizes to fit your ear). Better than any Motorola Bluetooth I've owed. Now the bad; the detachable lower stalk (the battery recahrge option) is useless. The thing just won't work; I just tossed it after several attempts with new batteries; but the plug-in charge easily lasts allday so I just tossed the useless lower half away as I didn't want to hassle with return/replacement product process ...maybe AMAZON can ship me another one out of goodwill?"
5,Impressive,"It is no accident that Michael C. White's ""The Garden of Martyrs"" has received unqualified praise from the likes of Anita Shreve, Richard Russo, and A. Manette Ansay. This rich, compassionate, deeply moving novel will no doubt have an impact on American literature for years to come. As this novel amply illustrates, a talented writer can remind us that acts of courage and heroism can take many forms, and can reveal themselves in unlikely and surprising places. Michael White unpacks the crevices and narrow alleyways of ""hidden"" history, bringing it to life, suggesting how seemingly inconsequential and daily acts of courage and heroism can resonate throughout society and impact history. One will walk away from this novel emotionally drained, but inspired."
3,"Inspiring story, not literature","Wonderful book describing the amazing recovery of Morris Goodman, who, due to a faulty airplane engine (he'd just picked up his new plane), was sent into an incredible ordeal requiring him to call on everything he had to put his body and his life back together. Fortunately for Morris, he had a solid foundation in how to think properly in order to create the reality he wanted and in ignoring the negative prognostications of others, including his doctors, as unimportant to his reality. This is an amazing story and that is the reason to get it. It is not literature in the traditional sense, nor does it need to be; it is a blow-by-blow account of what happened during his healing process and in what sequence and how, at every turn, Goodman was able to call on his amazing powers of will to keep going and to rise above what must have been intense pain and stress on all kinds of levels."
4,"Very good, Not exactly what it says but super none the less","I found this book greatly helpful. I'm in collage and I really want to be a filmmaker. This books is full of tips and pointers on how to do it. If anything it provides that boost of self confidence that yes I can do this, even if i am the only person that belives in my self. Read this book and you'll know that you too can make movies."
5,The Kings of Black Metal,I have loved Immortal since their American Tour in support of Sons of Northern Darkness. This DVD is great. They are underrated in American Culture. Their music from the land of the Midnight sun inspires me regularly because it is true metal!! Thank you Immortal for being so darn talented with your Black Metal!
3,Function keys keep resetting,"The function keys on this keyboard support dual functions (F1 is new mail, F7 is play, etc). The annoying thing is that the special functions are enabled by default (F1 will start email instead of help, and F5 is Rewind instead of refresh). There's a small button on the keyboard used to set the function keys to their standard behavior. Unfortunately, I have to push this button every time I resume from hibernate. This becomes incredibly aggravating after only a few days, enough so I had to buy another keyboard. I will never buy another logitech keyboard."
1,Useless,Compared it with a laser IR reader. Up to 75F off as true 575F read 650F. Complete junk nothing more to say.
1,Save Your Time And Money,"Author makes some points that are rather obvious and then proposes solutions that you may or may not agree with. Overall, I found this book mediocre at best - just another financial journalist trying to make a buck with a provocative title.Save your time. Save your money."
4,tight collection,"one of the baddest hip-hop acts ever. so many cuts here. Melle Mel brought it hard on the Mic. Grandmaster flash is One of the Greatest DJ's ever. ""the Message"" and WHite Lines"" still speak loud and clear after all of these years. this collection is still slammin and the music still holds up as do the flow of the raps."
4,Small handy for laptop users,"I've had no problems with my camara. The picture quality is that of many Logitechs, so don't expect movie quality, but it's more than enough for my needs. It's very small, easy to install and hook up to your notebook to keep in touch. I've had no problems with the plastic base, as other users, and I suspect you really shouldn't have a problem with it as long as you don't abuse it. Remember, this is a product for a notebook user on the road, so don't expect the heavy duty quality of a desktop camara either."
3,not fully compatible,"I got this thinking it'd be compatible with my pc, but the one I got was a one-sided chip and my pc uses two-sided chips so I ended up having only 64mb more ram. I returned it and got a Crucial stick instead."
4,Meat Grinders of the World Unite!,My grandmother made sausage. My mother didn't so I guess it skips a generation. I bought this meat grinder because it included the sausage attachments and you can't beat the price! It works great and now our whole family gathers around on Saturday nights to make delicious homemade sausage. The possibilities are endless and there are a zillion recipies on the internet. It is probably not time or cost effective if you purchase store bought meats but you can add as much garlic as desire. Your friends will be amazed and perplexed!
1,Arrived But Didn't Work,"This item arrived on time, it looked nice, but it did not work. It is a wind-up model and the spring was broke."
1,Accuride Clock letdown,"Sometimes the alarm will work, sometimes (most of the) time it doesn't. Can't trust it so it it going in the trash."
4,great for the layperson,This book is a great read as an intro to Unitarian Universalism. I highly suggest it
5,Best book all three!!,"I've finally read the three books of war of the ancients archive and by far the is the best part of all.Epic Ending with shocking events, this book should be made a movie out of it! (including the previous two book)Well done Richard i salute you!"
2,Interesting story...if you don't mind being bored.,"This is an okay book. I certainly wouldn't read it again or recommend it to my friends, but it wasn't THAT bad. Personally, I think that Marina is really REALLY annoying with her little ""Why can't i just believe it all completely"" act. I mean, come ON! It gets really old after 20 times saying it!!! I have to say that Jed was my favorite character in the story. He was realistic and acted like a real teenage boy would. But Marina was way too dramatic for me. Another character I though unrealistic was Leo. Leo is a chicken. He gets scared easily and is very clingy. Even for a three year-old, he seems a little too afraid. At three years old, shouldn't he be off terrorizing the other little kids? I thought that three year-olds were supposed to be a nightmare! I know my brother and sister were!"
2,"Cool premise, but only an okay book","This book about two teens caught in a cult like the one in Waco has a very cool premise, but I never really believed in it. First of all, the guy and the girl didn't talk like any teenagers that I know, but more like grown-ups think that teens talk. Second, there were too many things that were impossible. The leader of the cult banned TV, but not computers. There was a guy from the FBI inside the cult, but he he did not talk to FBI headquarters as soon as he saw all the guns in the cult, and he did not even have a backup cellphone? Plus, after all the bloodshed at the end, the guy and the girl do not seem very affected by their experience. Too many holes in the story for me to really enjoy it."
3,Easy book,"The book focuses around Marina and Jed's life. Their parents found this new religion and so now their all believers. On July 27th, also Marina's birhtday, the world will come to an end. So 144 of the Believers travel up to Weeupcut and spend many weeks there to avoid dying in the fire at the end of the world. Jed and Marina become convinced their parents are nuts, but they can't do anything about it, so they wait with them and help everyone become prepared for the new life after July 27th 200.This is a very adventurous book, it will make you want to skip a few pages ahead to find out what will happen, but also makr you want to stay and read more. Jane Yolen and Bruse Coville did an amazing job on the description.pg. 79""Do you?"" she asked slowly, hesitantly. ""Marina? Believe?"""
3,AS Review,"The title of this book pretty much describes the plot. Two teenagers, Jed and Marina, narrate the story of armageddon.This book was at first very uninteresting, but the boredom was lifted later on. However, I couldn't relate or appeal to the two narrating characters, although they were well thought out to give variety of viewpoint to the conflict of the plot. Also, I didn't enjoy the pre-climactic reading. The book didn't hold my interest well.I didn't enjoy this book too much. I would recommend Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins's Left Behind series over this, for better plot development, characters, and pretty much every other novel component."
3,Armageddon Summer review,"Armageddon Summer is a good book for people who like a mixture of soap opera and action/adventure . Its a book about two kids who follow their parents to Mt. Weeupcut , because their parents belive that the world is going to end! The only problem is that Jed and Marina (the kids) aren't sure if they belive, But as the deadline of life grows closer they have to decide what they belive! So if you want to find out what happens Read Armageddon Summer!"
4,Good mouse,"I bought my MX300 from the local Best Buy (30$ and a 15$ rebate on the way). Previously, I used Logitech's basic optical mouse (a great mouse for a great price) and there doesn't seem to be much of a difference. I'm not much of a gamer (there may be a difference for these people), but there doesn't seem to be much of a difference except for the additional programmable button (which I do not make much use of). I just use Alt+Tab to change windows anyway. I guess the only thing that made me buy this mouse was the sharp black and gray colors. So if you have a black or gray monitor or computer case, buy this mouse."
2,Technically: A+ ; Ergonomically: not for everyone,"I had no problems with installing this mouse, and kind of liked the function of the small button, which lets you flip between open applications. The problem I had, which made me return this mouse the next day, was the fact that my hand went numb after using it for half an hour (to be fair, I have had tendinitis in my wrist and elbow before, so I may be more sensitive to a mouse shape than others). The scroll wheel was a little further back than my other mouse, the buttons were set back from the front a little (so my hand could not rest over the front of the mouse and still hit the buttons), and the shape was not comfortable. This mouse will probably fit great in a woman's hand, but not in mine. I'm no giant, either (I can palm a volleyball with ease, but not a basketball). The Labtec Optical Mouse, at ..., is a far better deal. I can't notice a difference between the two as far as speed and accuracy are concerned."
4,Enjoy original Zamfir...,"This collection album contains Zamfir's earliest numbers, which I prefer to his recent recodings, than any other ones do. My favorite songs are ""The Lonely Shepherd"", ""E'te D' Amour"", ""Deguello"", ""Floral dance"", ""Traumerei"" and ""Theme From Limelight"". A few songs including ""Gloria"" are too moody for me. Anyway, this CD is decent and worth getting. However, I can't get enough only with this CD. I really want some of his original albums to be released. There were such good albums as titled ""E'te D' Amour""."
4,tastes good,"Great product, good taste, easy to make. We use it for overseas travel when we do not trust the local food."
5,da yoopers!,"hey, it da yoopers!nothing but funI bought several of these mainly out of curiosity and after listening so them, I decided to share them with a friend of mine.these guys have a great timedown to earth people."
1,Only a few good songs. Came With Scratch.,Wow was I disappointed when I received this CD. There was only a few good songs that I liked. I'm not really into mainstream but whats up with the &quot;Get that dirt off your shoulders&quot; and &quot;Moment of Clarity&quot; being on such a trashy CD? Just find a site where you can download songs for $0.99 that are legal and pick what you want. I realized that I dont like these CD's that get messed up with junk and have 2 hit singles.
5,My best investment.,This keyboard is the best investment in office equipment that I've made this whole year. I have a fantastic piece of equipment for a bargain.
1,Standard keys don't work in standard fashion,"It's great if a keyboard adds value by providing additional features and capabilities, but it is totally unacceptable to do so at the cost of making it incompatible with standard keyboards. The fact that you have to hit the F-Lock key every time you want standard keys to behave in the standard fashion is 100% unacceptable. I cannot imagine any experienced computer users finding this desirable. (On the other hand, if you never learned to use the keyboard shortcuts, I suppose it doesn't matter.) Logitech, add all the keys you want--but ensure that the function keys (including alt+ and ctrl+ function keys) work by default the way they are supposed to. (Logitech claims you can modify your configuration to make it behave in a standard fashion, but this doesn't apply to any of the alt+ or ctrl+ function keys. Additionally, the default should be to behave in the standard fashion in the first place.)"
4,The Review by Steve,this product is not bad. have great functions and could fit any office or home user. one issue with the product is that you can not tell how many hours left of the current bulb. so do not buy a used one.
4,77c 2200,"Used it twice. So far has no problem using it. All projectors are heat producer.When finish using it, may need to let it cool down prior to putting back into the bag/carry-on nylon case.Price is affordable relatively. Resolution is about right (if native resolution can be one level up, say, 1600 by 1200 then it would have been ideal)"
1,"This book is really 'Living Well in Mexico,' 1999.","This book (first published by Muir in 1999 as Living Well in Mexico) was merely OK the first time around, but this version is literally the very same thing, just three years older (it is true that several miniscule changes have been made, for example using ""50"" instead of ""fifty""). Although I read another review saying this was the same book, I must admit I assumed it couldn't be true and ordered it anyway--a mistake! I'm sending it back even though it pains me to pay the postage."
5,Great tasting!,You will love these protein bars! Taste great with no aftertaste and provide energy without overdosing you on carbs. Would definitely recommend! Great before or after working out and they digest easily too.
1,Horrible Experience,"Great taste, but it destroyed my stomach. I've never been made so miserable by a protein bar."
3,Average webcam,"There is nothing too amazing about this webcam, standard features with reasonable frame rate. I've bounced it around since having it and it still works fine."
2,deceptive,Amazon says that this item has a video monitoring system. This is not true. I sepnt more money on this camera because the description led me to beleive that this camera had the software for video monitering. You have ot buy extra software to do this.
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000,"Bought this item from Justdeals.com This is an exellent item which has an options on and off for autozoom and clearly in picture or images.Also, Seller from Justdeals.com (Kenny) is a professional customer service helps me track the item that been lost (order) and follow up until I got it.Thanx...."
3,"Not bad, but confusing.","The camera works. Installation is easy. This is not the best camera and regarding picture and video quality - just average.The specification for this camera are confusing. The camera has ""Face tracking"" option and of course when I read it I expected same face tracking as the Orbit webcam (real tracking). Apperantly it does not do a tracking - it just plays with zoom in/out and not always successful.Other than this - average webcam."
3,GOOD,"Camera works well. The software was fine. The stand is a little [low quality] (pops apart when you adjust). Audio was great. I use it mainly with the Logitech IM messenger companion, which works great. The picture quality on the CCD sensing 4000 Pro did not seem much better than the CMOS sensing QuickCam Express my father has. Great buy from Amazon.com, with rebate was cheaper than most of the basic units without audio."
2,"Nice picture, bad mechanical","I am happy with the picture quality of this web cam. However, the mechanical leaves a lot to be desiredWith one day of using it, the camera head started flopping around. Looks like the spring this is supposed to be holding the head on to the base is very weak and after pointing the camera a few times, it became very loose and there is no way to tighten it or adjust it.I thought I just had a bad one so I exchanged it. When I got the new one home, I was as careful as I can be. But within one week, the same thing happened. It is obviously a mechanical design flaw. The worse part is that the USB cable attached to the camera head is long and thick relatively to the camera. With the camera head being loose, the cable now controls which direction the carmea points to.This makes the camera almost unusable."
5,Easy to install and setup!,"By far, one of the easiest and fastest setups & installations I've ever done. Within 10 minutes of opening the package we were up and running and our boys were able to wave to their grandma & grandpa! LOVE IT!!!!!! We'll be buying one for all of our family members so we can stay in touch!"
4,"great product, but upset with amazon customer service","Unfortunately, I threw out the box before I could get the UPC code I needed for the $20 rebate Logitech was offering. I emailed Amazon's customer service to see if they could help; maybe they had the UPC code on file somewhere. All they did was send me some vague email(which I suspect did not have a human author, instead computer-generated) asking me to contact the manufacturer. Logitech is not going to know the UPC code of the camera I bought; that's why they ask for it in the rebate submission. Thanks, Amazon, and I've been a loyal customer!As for the Quickcam, it's great. Works well with windows messenger and MSN messenger. I bought one for my mom and one for myself so my daughter could get to see her grandmother who lives in Florida"
4,"Good reading, if you can find a copy...","Moongather is book 1 in the Duel of Sorcery trilogy, and tells the story of Serroi, a ""misborn of the windrunners"", as both young girl and young woman (the two stories being told in parallel fashion throughout the book). For those readers who like strong female lead characters, this book would be a good choice.The writing is very good and moves the reader along briskly. Some of the magic presented will seem familiar to D&D aficionados, not necessarily in specifics but rather in form. The tajicho, for example, an object which acts to hide its bearer from magical eyes, is created by removing an eggshaped growth in the center of the brain case of a monster called the Nyok'chui and calling down lightning on it. The various levels of Nor (or magicians) wield power through the calling and controlling of various types of demons."
2,"Not bright, and the magnet came off","I bought this light for 70 dollars from another seller. Yes it has a zillion different ways for the light to flash. The magnet pulled off of it the SECOND time I used it, rendering it useless. I won't buy another one to see if this was a fluke. It's not nearly as bright as a regular (incandescent?) strobe anyway. Maintainance free or not."
3,My wife's favorite chocolate,I am not a huge fan of this candy but indulge my wife's desire for it. They are tasty and good. I buy these every Christmas as part of my gift to my wife.
5,accuracy,"I like how there are no hand holes in the frame, I always thought of these points as weak points where the level would skew when left in the hot sun."
4,Good information,"I have started and stopped the book several times, mostly because of time constraints around the holidays. Have yet to complete the book .. What I like about the book is that it is readable in small portions, the tenor is positive, it is helpful in understanding what's going on in our heads and also helps in understanding our older family members and what they may be concerned about. Maybe more from this end when I finally finish the book.One last thing.. think I'd purchase this in paper rather than on line for ease in making notes."
3,First experience with Simenon,"I have to confess, I read this book because it was an assignment in my French IV class. Being the open-minded, enthusiastic reader I am, I was excited to read my first French detective novel. (Keep in mind, this is sort of a beginner level French book.) I have now finished the book and can honestly say I think it deserves 3.5 stars out of 5. It was intersting. And it was short. It started out being pretty detailed but then Maigret, the detective and main character, decided he had done enough investigating and went after the main guy he'd been talking to the whole book. The ending was the thing that got me. When I read a detective story, I assume there will be an interesting ending that the rest of the book led up to. I found the ending to this book to be very abrupt and unsatisfying. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and I wouldn't mind picking up another of Simenon's 350 or so books."
1,Not happy!,"I ordered this Dvd thinking wot a great deal at a buck fifty...well one gets wot one pays for...doesnt one... Grrrrr...This DvD has only 1 movie on it..the packaging looks handmade...the label that is...looks like a photo copy, and on the label it states 8 movies on 1 disc...YAH RIGHT!!! it only has the one..it is a burned disc...a rip off...it has generic options when you play it...""play and menu for scene selections""...and half way through this movie there is a problem with the sync...there is no SYNC! I am so not happy.Shirley Temple Classics - 8 Filmsagain i say save your money!Sincerely DITA. >=0("
2,Replaced it once - Replacement has problems too,"The first year of owning this it was fine. But then it started giving me problems. It would boot up and then power off within a matter of seconds, in a continous cycle. So my computer would detect it and then it wouldn't... and then it would detect it... and then it wouldn't... a never ending cycle until I get frustrated and just unplug it. I returned it and they gave me a replacement. This one is acting the same way. I don't recommend this product."
1,Do Not Buy This,"Everything about this drive seemed great for a while. I was quite thrilled with it, in fact. Then we blew a fuse and now the. drive. is. completely. dead. Not a flicker of life from one little power incident. It's still under warranty so I called Western Digital. They said that this happens sometimes and then it will work again with a new power cord, which they sent me. Still nothing. They'll replace the unit but why would I ever want to use another one of these ridiculous pieces of useless junk? Let's remember that this is supposed to provide data security!Read other reviews - you will find I am far from the only person to have experienced this exact same problem."
4,Western Digital USB2 External hard drive,"The hard drive was a simple installation, plug and play, except on my desktop computer. Customer service has been working on the problem, however, to date it is serving another computer. If it is eventually installed on my computer the rating would be 5 stars. Otherwise....1 star!"
1,I would never buy another Western Digital drive again,"I have had this drive for over a year now. At first it seemed okay, but the software that comes with it does not work well, the drive itself spends more time frozen than functioning, and the website has not been a helpful place for information. Before I realized what a problem this drive is I got one for my mom, too. She's having the same problems. I am researching other backup drives but will not even consider getting anything from Western Digital."
2,"Warranty runs out, POP goes the drive",It was a great deal when I bought it for my Mac as a backup drive for Time Machine. Worked quite well... until the warranty ran out. Within 30 days it quite working. However well it worked for whatever price I paid wasn't worth it when it broke after a year and I had to start all over.
2,Can't be used with a power strip,"I tried this drive on two different computers using two different USB cables but neither computer would detect it. I finally called Western Digital and they advised me to plug it directly into a wall outlet, not a power bar. I did, and it worked, but in my case it was a fatal flaw as the only wall outlet in my work area is buried behind a heavy desk, and both receptacles are already in use. I can't understand how it could even make a difference whether it's plugged into the wall or a power bar, but apparently it does since WD said it's a known problem. This seems like a limiting factor on the drive's versatility and portability, and I also worry about how reliable it will be if it's so sensitive to such a basic detail as the type of power outlet."
2,"Good hardware, bad software and support","I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista. As a result of the Windows upgrade, this product just lost half its value for me. The drive works fine physically, but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling. As others have noticed here, Western Digital offers ZERO support for its software - I cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem."
2,The good and bad with a Mac,"I bought one a while back to be used with my Imac. I picked this because they had this auto on and off feature.The good: depending how you position it is makes very little noise. They include both firewire and usb cable.The bad: The auto on and off feature works only with USB. I played a lot with it but it never switches off when connected via firewire. In the end this didn't bother me too much so I bought a 2nd one hoping to use my 2nd firewire port or daisychain both drives which should work per WD website. However as the drives share the same firewire ID the mac can not handle this and will not recognize the drives when both are connected. So I ended up with one drive on my USB port, switching on and off automatically and the other connected via firewire always beeing on. Daah.So my recommendation if you are using a Mac is do not bother to pay extra for firewire even though it seems to be a tad quicker then the USB connection and spend the money on a USB hub."
1,Died 11 Months In,Similar to other reviews. Loud clicking then dead. 11 months old. Wow. Definitely stay away from this product. If it were a car there would be a mass re-call.
1,Don't keep anything on it you care about,"I've now had two of these fail on me, within the warranty period. The first one just stopped working one day, making all kinds of nasty clicking sounds. The current one (warranty replacement for the first) just started breeding bad sectors like rabbits. The total life span of these are about 3-4 months, MAX.This is completely unacceptable. I have drives that are 10 years old that still run perfectly but WD can't seem to make a MyBook Premium that lasts 10 months.If you need a cheap external drive, get ANYTHING else."
3,"Good capacity, so-so performance","I bought this hard drive as a back-up to another 250 GB external drive and while for the most part it works as stated, there are times when it can be a little bit of a pain. I use it with a Mac and sometimes it has problems when the computer goes into sleep mode and the back-up program it comes with is nothing amazing. It does the minimum though and for the price is still a good deal."
1,"WD, what's wrong with you??","In a few words, save yourself the frustrations and buy something else.Here's why:1- The power button doesn't work2- The bundled backup software is a joke. It took 43 minutes to backup a 190 MB (MB NOT GB!!) folder... switching to Firewire will speed things up a little, but come on!!3- The backup structure is too complicated4- Forget about backup scheduling... it doesn't work. Period.5- Files appear and disappear (don't bother rebooting, it won't fix it)6- Heats up excessively, even when in a well ventilated area... oh, and it vibrates too!7- Support is useless and a waste of time and neuronsMajor disappointment and a waste of my hard-earned dollars. Never buying a WD product again! LACIE never let me down, so I learned my lesson."
3,Simple backup storage,"Attractive ""book"" like hard drive fits nicely amongst other parts of the desk or office.Simple to set up and manage files.Handles both PC and Mac interchangeablyLED circle in the front tells you that the hard drive is spinningThough not terribly loud, the lack of a cooling fan won't rattle your desk****Update*****After a year working it just died with the click of death. No way to recovery, all of my files were lost"
1,Dont buy - 2nd one just crashed,"Do a little research, wish I had, I bought two of these and both have crashed within 60 days of each other, (less than 6 months old). Very dissapointing, and after the crash I started reading up on them, and it appears there a great number of people who have shared my fate.My advice, buy a different brand, pay a bit more perhaps, and dont lose your data."
1,Hours of work lost in an instant,"First off, let me say I did NOT purchase this item from Amazon. I have no issues with Amazon's service.I do have an issue, however, with a hard drive that with NO warning suddenly stops working. I lost 2000 music cds and approximately 30 movies. I have backups for approx 1800 of the music cds. The rest, alas, are gone. No warning. I booted up my computer, it made 3 series of 3 metallic clicks and was no longer seen by Windows. Western Digital's less-than-helpful website basically said, ""Yep, it's toast. You can either send it back and we'll send you a new one when we feel like it, or you can have a hold placed on your credit card for twice the retail value of the item and we'll send you a replacement first."" I plan to sell the replacement one and find a better product to invest in."
3,A little flat,"We purchased these and the Djembe for my kids. While the Djembe has a wonderful, rich sound, the Bongos sound flat. To be clear, I am not a drummer, so I suspect I am doing something wrong. I did try holding them several different ways, but couldn't quite get the sound I wanted. Since I want my kids to be able to play these easily, I will be sending them back. As far as workmanship and durability, they seem to be well crafted and sturdy. However, I would recommend trying other Remo kids drums instead."
5,Great keyboard for young child,We bought this for our granddaughter who is just starting out playing and taking lessons (age 5). It has worked flawlessly so far and she really seems to like the lighted keys.
4,perfect for small hands,"This is the most comfortable mouse I have ever owned. I've had several of them. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I find that the cable gets twisted. Not only is this uncomfortable to use, but the twisting shredded the cable at the computer end & it stopped working.Even then, after trying other mice, I always go back to this one - even if I have to buy it over again. If it was wireless, I'd give it 10 stars."
5,A Much Needed Resource,"For most Catholics - to say nothing of non-Catholics - the world of the Vatican is shrouded in mystery. Ironically, it becomes even more secretive just when it receives the most attention during the period between the death of one pope and the election of another. Even professional observers are generally at a lost given the arcane way that clerical world operates. Now John-Peter Pham, a former insider in this strange world, lifts the veil ever so slightly, presenting a balanced, historical perspective on events that will be closely followed by millions. This long overdue account will be the resource as the days draw near when John Paul II will meet his Maker and all the camera lenses of the world will focus on the Eternal City."
4,"Great details, and great research on the theme.","There are some books about the Conclaves available. Pope John Paul II's long, and amazing, pontificate created a great buzz about who would be his successor. And not without merit. It's a ""hard act to follow"", as they say in art.What really distinguishes Mr. Pham's book from others is his research on the Church's history of the conclave. It's a great addition to such a book. And his research is sound, and very well documented. Something that not all take care to do.The only down point of the book is that for a scholarly book, Mr. Pham sometimes lets his personal opinions speak louder, and inserts some very misplaced, and sometimes almost peasant, criticism. He is entitled to his opinions, but it feels out of place on a book like this. And don't actually add anything, the way he throws them among scholarly details.Overall, a very recommended book."
5,Puppy loves her ball,"Our new pup adores this bouncy ball. The shape makes it easy for her to retrieve and soft ""squishiness"" makes it fun for her to stalk and pounce upon! Super quality, will last a long time."
2,Doesn't last,"I bought this for my 16 month old, 47lbs. Aussie Sheppard mix. She loved it. And she tore a piece off within 5 minutes. I took it away. I played with her briefly again with it, then she was chewing while we talked. It was 1/3 destroyed in about half an hour. She did like it. She took one angled 1 inch piece and wanted me to play tug-of-war with it with her! I only wished it held up a reasonable amount of time, as I was led to believe by other reviews."
3,World record holder,"From the previous reviews, I was hoping that this toy would last a while. Our puppy (Lab/Border Collie mix) is a medium chewer and to give perspective, she has been chewing on her first Nylabone every night for the last 10 weeks and she's still going. With this product, she broke down the ball in about 5-10 minutes and swallowed most of the pieces. She enjoyed the product but I would recommend supervising your pet while playing with this product. If not, be prepared to clean up the mess when they vomit the pieces out."
2,10 Minutes,"The item was neat - fun to throw - low slime factor. However, it only took 10 minutes for my dog to shred the item into tiny pieces. To be fair, my dog can destroy most anything in short order - she sharpens her teeth by chewing on rocks and eats acorns as light snacks. I was hoping that this would hold up to the onslaught, but alas, it did not.(On the plus side - I think this was her favorite chew toy ever - she is still munching on the tiny pieces - thus the two stars.)So watch out if your dog is an aggressive chewer - it will not hold up."
5,Great toy for small puppy!,"We got the smallest sized ball for our puppy the day after we brought her home - its been about a month now and this is still one of her favorite toys. She is a very small Shih-Tzu (3lbs 11oz) and the ball was small enough and designed so that she could catch it in her tiny mouth right from the start. She loves to chase it and bring it back, in fact I have to stop typing periodically so that I can toss it for her to fetch even as I'm posting this review. I think I'll get a couple more of these in larger sizes. Great little toy!Editing to addI picked up the larger 6.5 inch size at my local grocery store (it was significantly cheaper there than it is here on Amazon) and my puppy is nuts over it. She can easily pick it up and toss it herself and she loves to run around batting at it. She is just under 4lbs and this larger ball makes her feel like a big dog. :) I am sure I'll be buying the next size up in the next couple of months. Great toy."
4,Great for tug of war,"Unless I was pulling on it, our dogs weren't interested. So, I gave it to our neighbor ... whose dog loves it. For that reason, I'm giving it 4 stars, even though my dogs weren't into it really."
2,Disappointment,"Toy is holding together by ""threads"" after two days of playing. It was not an expensive toy, but did expect a bit better durability than just a couple days of playing catch inside. Our dog loves it, but won't waste my money on buying more for her to just destroy in a day."
5,Great Toy,"This toy has held up very well, my great dane has played with this for a while and it has not broken yet."
3,Destroyed,"My 61 lb pit bull absolutely destroyed this in practically no time, but he had a fun time doing it! He still plays with pieces of it in the backyard. For the price, it wasn't a total loss."
2,didn't last as long as the old one,"We bought a version of this about 10 years ago. It made it through three puppies. Our new puppy had it for about three or four months and finally chewed through it. So we bought a new one. It lasted two days. That's it. On the plus side, it is a favorite toy of all my dogs. We put other favorite toys into it and let the dogs figure out how to get them out. Sometimes we put a bit of kibble into a rag and tie it into a knot. Then we put it into this ball. Again, it is the dog's job to figure out how to get it out. But this one wasn't as well made as the original one we had."
5,My Dog Loves This Ball!,"My Becky had a smaller size, and it was snagging on her lower canines and making it difficult for her to put it down.I ordered the largest size and no further problems. In fact, she hasn't put it down since it arrived!Being larger, it's thick and sturdy too. The better to resist sharp teeth!The colors are chosen for you, but we got a blue one that's nice and visible.Being only a little over a year old, it's still very important for my Becky to get plenty of exercise, and this is a great toy to use.we took it outside and it rolled over mud, ice, gravel, and snow and remained clean.No mess when the dog carries it back inside!I'm very impressed and definitely recommend this toy for your active dog!"
1,Erratic Mouse,"I tried to use this mouse with my Mac G4 and it is erratic and all over the desktop and therefore unusable. The driver install went all right, but after all looked good, a belated error message showed up that something was wrong with an extension. The pdf handbook that comes on the accompanying CD contains no useful info and does not provide info for fixes. It does indicate an address for tech support. I emailed tech support and received no answer."
2,Take from a user who had it a while...it doesn't last.,Sorry to say our Macally Icemouse stopped working properly within a couple of years of purchase. Often the mouse now signals a double click to the computer when only a single click has been made. Click and drag also does not work right. I'll be replacing it with an Apple Magic Mouse.
1,"Actually, the writers hate America","This book is a perfect example of the writers drawing a general conclusion then using only portions of the relevant data to support their argument. The timing of this book also discredits the general thesis as well as the writers try to make BROAD statements about America's place in the world while using data that is a snap shot of one particular controversial period of American foreign policy. While looking at some of the graphs, notice the nations excluded from the discussion. Israel, Australia, South Korea and the Latin American and South American nations barely get any mention. Why? because the data from these countries does not fit into the authors' conclusions."
5,Great product,This is a great package of John Grisham audio books for one low price. Fast shipment. Highly recommended.
4,Another Set of Cool Miniatures,"This set of miniatures is particularly cool in that they've got a nice list of creatures to add to your collection. For instance, I got a werebear, which is pretty cool looking. They did a nice job painting all the minis and that's good for a change. The minis are made of durable plastic, so they don't break very easily. Over all, this miniature booster set is a nice addition to any D&D fans collection."
4,Angel fire,D&D miniatures is a universal way to encourage the imagination and the strategic inteligence of any individual.
3,The sex continues,"Russ Martin has created a world in which the forces of evil are capable of enslaving men and women by increasing sexual desire to the highest possible level. Many of the characters in this book have been introduced to us in Martin's previous books, and it is probably a good idea to read The Education of Jennifer Parrish only after reading the earlier books in the series. If you are turned on by stories of sexual domination, you will probably like this series."
4,Almost great for TSA travel.,"This case is great for what it is. Pelican needs to design a small case like this specifically for TSA travel. I fit my handgun, holster, three clips and an extra box of ammo in this beautifully. The only thing that sucks is that you have to use two padlocks and they can easily be cut off. Pelican needs a center combo lock or a hasp that can't be cut easily."
5,Case Storm Case,I got this case for my camera. I wanted to strap it to the deck of my kayak. It fits perfectly and it was easy to add some holes so I could tie it down. It also fit my DSLR camera with a wide angle lens and also has room to hold another lens. I was also able to strap my GPS on the top of it.
1,waste of time and money,"This dictionary has words that haven't been used in english in my lifetime. Useless words when that space could have been used in the book for more useful terms. Also some of the translations are horrible. If you want to learn useless information buy this book. If not then look elsewhere. There is a lot of military words in here but I will never have to tell a serbian there is an air raid or ask where i can buy a bayonett, or the other things in here."
3,Learn2 Training Complete Only For Beginners,"If you have never used Office before or you are a beginner, then this product may assist you. If, however, you are looking for something a little more advance then you should look elsewhere. This software only includes beginner stuff"
3,It was alright,This is the better one of this series. A little dissapointing but OK.For such old movies the print was in good shape
5,GREAT PUZZLE!!!,"My 6 year old daughter actually found this puzzle at church, and has played with it every Sunday ever since (which is going on 2 years now)I finally decided to break down and look for it! I searched every store in our town to no avail, but was extatic to find it here!!I ordered two sets of these, and I know they will be played with for hours!!The things I love about this toy are mainly that it teaches her geometric skills and problem solving while she is too busy having fun to notice that she is learning, and the fact that they make no noise, require no batteries and come with their own container is just the icing on the cake for me! The cherry on top- the price!Any child who loves puzzles and putting things together would absolutely LOVE this toy... I know mine does!"
3,Great band. So-so comilation.,"Compiles excellent early singles like New Way and Ghetto. It also includes selections from their first album (Personal Troubles and Public Issues) and third album (Day Tripper).The Wall were not a conventional punk band and incorporated other influences beyond punk into their music. This compilation is skewed towards their punkier material which means that some weaker material is included while some of their best songs are excluded. It also completely omits any songs from their second and best album, Dirges and Anthems.All in all worth getting especially for the early singles. Highlights include New Way, Suckers, Uniforms, Exchange, Ghetto, Another New Day, Fight the Fright, In Nature, and When I'm Dancing.It's definitely worth tracking their albums down, especially Dirges and Anthems."
3,Heavy and hard to pull but handy if you need it,"The chair is great if you need a quick place to sit down - the bag is handy if you have things to carry. However, it is heavy to drag around and low to the ground so even for someone petite in size, it's a strain to pull."
2,Buy his first two albums.,"This collection makes it very clear how unecessary anything in his solo catalogue but 'Smash Your Head Against The Wall' and 'Whistle Rymes' are. His first two albums are dark, clever and clearly were comprised of material he'd had brooding inside for quite some time.Frankly I find any of the tracks on which Entwistle himself doesnt sing on, and there are a few in this collection, utterly pointless. The CD features some live cuts as well, which are forgettable, though it should be noted this is the only time 905 was performed live.The only saving grace for the second disc is Bogeyman, featuring a 'Who Are You' era Keith Moon on drums and simple bass and synth, making it a stripped-down treasure for Who and Entwistle fans alike.So go buy his first two albums and hunt down 'Bogeyman' by some other means."
3,GOOD BOOK,"These brothers are a riot. Just like there last names. Wilbur and Orville Riot makeSnarf attack, undefoodle and the secret of life, Riot brothers tell all a lol comedy.As the principal's kids you think they would be angles. Well that's not the case.They are trouble at there house and even at school.They go threw adventures together. And play a couple games. But when one day when they want to over throw a king. To bad it has to be a school day. So in the middle of the night they try to make it a snow day.Will they get the snow day? Will they stay the same old riots? Or will they change?So many questions, but not a lot of answers. So if you want to find out come read Mary Amoto's Snarf attack, undefoodle and the secret of life, Riot brothers tell all.Can you handle their secrets?"
2,A Keyboard for Beginners ONLY,"As a person who has played piano for more than a decade, I don't personally like this electronic keyboard.I bought this keyboard for my temporary residence, hoping to use this one to practice my fingers while I'm not at home with my piano. Having played piano for so long, I was not sure when I bought this keyboard. The keys felt so different on this keyboard.I don't recommend it for anyone who has played at least 1 year of piano, even if you want to have a cheap substitute for your temporary use (go with Yamaha, the DGX220 is a little more expensive but has a lot more features and feels).If you are a beginner, it may be wise to purchase this keyboard for some practice."
4,it's nice,"it's a nive keyboard.as for a beginner, it's totally more than enough.i would to recommend this if you are still wondering around looking for smth for a beginer."
1,Late products cannot be reviewed!,"Order placed Jan16.No explanation received for late delivery.Dont mind waiting,but should be told why.Hope this item comes with a stand.....its the least casio should do."
4,Transitions Review.,"If you're a Digweed fan, you will like this disc. It lacks the energy of a live set, say his 5-16-99 set done at Twilo, NY, or his set in Miami in '02 during the Delta Heavy tour, which aren't even for sale. Go figure. But this disc is very good for a studio mix, plenty of changes, drops, good bass lines. Vintage Digeed. You will enjoy this disc."
2,Not Good,"I was expecting more than what I got. The sound quality on this CD is not very good. I bought the CD mainly to get a copy of a specific song. The song was there, but is was just a capture from the movie audio track with part of the actors dialog included. I am not impressed."
5,true American history of slavery ever written,"This book is true and honest about American Slavery. No punches pulled. great for junior high school, high school and college,"
2,Poor video,This video could have been done much better. Gave the appearance that it wasn't well planned and done with a home video camera.
2,Below average video,This video was badly created. The background narration was poor. I had to return this tape due to manufacture defect. I could have created my own home sniper video.
3,MOBY - maybe,"Since this is one MOBY's first CD's, one cannot be too tough on him. However, the term ambient (penned by Brian Eno in the Seventies) used to mean multi-layered, ethereal space/mood music. Moby keeps the layers and the moods, but the constant percussion (it's good) keep it from being anything but relaxing. This represents a good foreshadowing of what moby was to produce."
3,"You can say that his ambient music just ""exists""","Ok...I'll say this...I was not too impressed by some of his ambient tunes, but it wasn't too bad either. The ones I really went into another world with was, My Beautiful Blue Sky, Heaven, & Tongues. The way the ambient melodies moved with the light, background beat made these three tracks such a joy to listen to. After that I honestly thought he went downhill...don't get me wrong though, I really like hearing music that have a nice piano melody, but, not the way Moby did it. His piano tunes were a little too boring for my taste (they are better on 'Everything Is Wrong') and I felt that they did not go anywhere irrelevant. Overall, I give 'Ambient' three stars for being SO-SO. Thanks!"
3,Vinyl CD almost like my Records !,"The top of this cd looks like a miniature Vinyl 45 with different colors for the label , if you buy the variety pack. The bottom / burn side of the CD looks like a standard CD-R with the shiny silver and a green sheen. I had no issues burning or playing in anything. It is a great product, but I felt the price was a little steep and the fact that I only could get 25 CD's in a pack was discouraging.James M Kitchen"
1,Didn't work with Windows Media Player & Windows XP,"I tried to burn music using Windows Media Player, OS Windows XP. I tried 5 different disks in the pack of Verbatim Digital Vinyl 700MB Multicolor CD-R and none of them would work. I emailed Verbatim asking why I'm having this problem. They emailed me back saying ""Try any third party burning software's like Nero or Ashampoo or Roxio or Sonic, because windows XP may not burn some file formats which are incompatible."" I wasn't happy with their response. So I thought I would share this info with potential buyers of this product."
3,Cool BUT ...,"These are as cool-looking as they are in the picture above BUT, these CD-Rs will NOT record in a stand alone, home audio CD recorder. These are designed for recording on a computer.If you can get someone with a computer to burn them, then fine. But if you just own a home CD recorder like I do, it's pretty much a waste of money if you can't use them. I don't know why Amazon doesn't point this out. Always buy MUSIC CD-Rs over DATA CD-Rs if you just own a home audio CD recorder. Let's get the message out there PLEASE."
3,Something is wrong...,"I don't know why these were not playable in my car cd player. The songs are all okay on my computer. I burned with iTunes to the cd, and have not had problems previously with other brands. I am not certain if it is this brand, but I thought I would warn folks in case others found the same problem."
4,Nostalgic,The Discs are colorfull and reminiscent of 45 rpm records. They do what they're supposed to and remind you of back then.
3,Only OK,"If roasting a large head of garlic it takes longer than time specified and, if roasting more than one head, they must be very small or they won't fit..."
3,Looks nice,"For the most part it works... the lettering wore off within a short time from just being wiped clean, little by little it disapeared."
1,Worked good 3 times,"This worked good 3 times and then it died- something shorted out on the circuit board. I really liked the roasted garlic, but will try a different kind next time."
4,New Roasting Pan,"This makes phenomenal roasted garlic in great time. Scrumptious! The only drawback I am finding? The roasting pan is non-stick. Mine got scratched and I can't find a replacement! Does this mean I have to purchase an whole new machine? Does anybody know where to buy parts?Also, for those interested, there is a newer version that allows one to adjust the cooking time with the new digital timer. Just Google ""Roasted Garlic Express Stainless Steel""."
4,Delicious Valentine's Day Gift,"I got these as a Valentine's Day gift for my wife, who says they were delicious. For those unfamiliar with Battenberg cakes, each of these consists of four little sponge cakes glued together in a checkerboard pattern with jam and the whole thing is covered with almond paste. These have been popular with afternoon tea in the UK for many years."
5,Exactly as I expected.,"I purchased these platters to go with the Corelle Chutney Dinner set that I already own. They arrived timely and were very well wrapped. They are exactly as I expected and I am very pleased. I enjoy Corelle and have used it for over 30+ years. For the money they are wonderful, durable, beautiful and have lasted so many years that I have two previous patterns that I really need to get rid of, as there is hardly any more room in my cupboards for them.... however, they are still in such great shape after all these years that I have had such a hard time parting with them. I appreciate that Amazon still carries some of the older patterns so that I can add to my set...such as bakeware, platters, etc. The fact that it also qualified for free shipping was an added bonus. I will always return to Amazon to check out their prices on Corelle and other items, especially when FREE SHIPPING is involved!"
3,What am I missing?,"I have read many many rave reviews of this lp, but I fail to see or hear how it is either a step forward, or an improvement on the fabulous Kill The Moonlight. It's ok to good but in comparison to KTM it lack invention, the quirkiness that makes Spoon special, it lacks the hooks, it lacks tunes. Too many songs outstay their welcome, too many revolve around the same monotonous riff for too long, or appear to be fragments of ideas that were never truly worked up successfully.That said, there are some high points - the title track, ""Monsieur Valentine"" and ""I summon you"" are top notch, but all in all it's a pretty mundane affair.Where Kill the Moonlight sounds like a band overwhelmed by the excitement and possibilities of life, the band here sound married too long and going through the motions."
1,boring,"This is when of those albums where about halfway through each song you say ""when is this gonna get going?"" and none of them ever do.It's like slow-motion bland-pop."
1,gimme a break,it is apparent how few of you who wrote reviews for this album have any clue about what you are saying. kill the moonlight...good indie rock album. that is where the significance of spoon comes to an abrupt halt. they are an ok band. fact. this album is puny in comparison to other indie albums this year. the boys in spoon should just do what they do best and sit around smoking pot in austin coffee shops and hope little scenesters will giggle in their direction.
2,It was not a good fit,It stated it would fit our Ford Explorer but far from it.I tried to fit it up and would take a lot of change to get it to fit but wouldn't look right anyway so I went a got one from Ford and I put it on in about 15 minutes and it look great.It may work on some other car but it sure wasn't for ours.
4,Great toy but broke early,"This toy was very well received by my 5 year old. The directions were well beyond him, but that didn't deter him. Unfortunately, the associated worm gear that drives the robot broke in about 5 minutes. I called the company who were very helpful and promised a new one by mail (still waiting). Even without the worm gear, the parts were easy to use(and of course scattered about the house). Overall, presuming I get the replacement worm gear, I would recomend this toy. It offers lots of imagination driven possibilities."
5,"Excellent ""basic"" cookbook","I received this book as a gift about 15 years ago & it is by far my most often used. It was originally copyrighted in 1901 & has been revised many times, however many of the recipes still appear as they did then. Recipes range from the very simple (scrambled eggs or grilled cheese sandwiches) to exotic (Fondue Bourguignonne). It will take you from breakfast to an after dinner cordial - all from scratch. Recipes are easy to follow. Basic equivalents (i.e.2.20 pounds = 1 kilo) & substitutions make converting any recipe easy. And it contains much more than just recipes. There are menu planning ideas, freezing, canning & dehydrating charts, special diet recipes, & even a stain removal guide! This is a great book for the beginning cook or someone that needs a bit of everything all in one place."
1,Misrepresentation,"They show an image of the book that I wanted but sent me a newer edition. The newer edition had less pages and different recipes. I filed a claim and they wrote ""return it to us for a refund."" Saying nothing of the incorrect image they displayed. Complete waste of my time."
2,"If you enjoyed the first two, you should read this one.","Of the three books in this series, this was undoubtably the worst. I greatly enjoyed the first two, and certainly do not think that my reading of the third book was a waste of time . . . but I think perhaps Ms. McCaffrey was a bit hasty in ending this storyline. She didn't have her usual depth in resolving the plots. The characters were also not as fully developed as I've come to expect from this marvelous author."
2,Not one of her best,"I was disappointed when I finished the book. Usually I can hardly put one of her books down, but I found this hard to get through, as it did not hold my attention at all."
4,"Good, but lacking something....","I love the Freedom series! The first two books were fantastic, but this one, was slower, Kris wasn't what she used to be...she was far too mellow and homewifey. The other characters, I felt, were not as well developed as they normally are...it was great to read, and the ending was fantastic, but it just didn't have that extra little ""sparkle"" that really makes a great book great....I want to read more....."
3,Semi - Wonderful,"I have really enjoyed reading the two previous books in this so far trilogy over and over. However, in this last book I was just getting settled into what was a great continuation when the story ended with many unanswered questions. Such as:1.What happens to Zianal's children. 2.What has happened on Earth and does Kristian B. ever find out about her family. 3. Do the farmers ever come back and what happens to the other worlds that were colonized. I really hope this is not the last book in this series because I will miss these characters very much if it is. Ms. McCaffery has started a wonderful saga with this story and I hope she will finish it with as much flair, adventure and style as she started it with. Thank you Ms. McCaffery for many hours of escape into the world of Botony and the people who made it their home."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed Freedoms Landing and Freedoms Choice. None of these books were what I would call ""deep"" or ""thought provoking"". They were just plain fun. I also enjoyed this novel, but there is a disquieting sense of disappointment with it as well. My understanding is that this is the last of the Freedom series. There are still many questions in this universe that McCaffrey has created. This book was rushed, almost as though the author was getting tired of the series. Too many convenient ""duex ex machina"" type plot devices. ""Gee whiz, lets use this conveniently placed herb to wipe out the overlords!"" If you have read the first two books, you have to read this to finish the series. Just don't expect too much....."
3,"Interesting, but disappointing.","I felt the character of Chris changed drastically -- and went downhill fast. In the first two books she was a self sufficient survivor, but not so in this book.I would have liked to see more development of other characters like Chuck who has always been one of my favorites, or Gino or Ray.The ending was predictable, but lots of fun. I'd like to see what happens on some of the other worlds, not just Botany."
5,Excellent DVD and stocking stuff,This is going to be a great stocking stuffer for this year. Looking forward to seeing the smile on the person's face!
1,"Benzino sucks, plain and simple.","First off, Shabazz...you're an idiot. 50 Cent a wack rapper? OKAR. Anyways, Benzino sucks. This guy is a joke. The only reason people will buy this s*** for an album is because this guy is getting his a** owned by Eminem. His song ""Look Into My Eyes"" which is ""a response to Eminem's Toy Soldiers"" is WEAK AS SH*T...which seems to be a common occurance with his music. And then, to add to that he has the audacity to say he's the hottest thing since 2PAC?! He can use as many guest appearances and dead rappers he wants on his album and he will NEVER match up to Eminem...period."
2,ToolBook Book Review,"I have used this book in a college course. Some lessons are helpful, but was frustrated often due to inaccurate or unclear steps and wasted hours trying to figure it out.Also, many times you go thru a lesson, but don't know what you're trying to accomplish until the end! Author needs to work on adding adult learning principles here.Bottom line - can be frustrating."
1,Broke me out,"I read that neem was a good option for detoxifying and clearing your skin. I have some ingrown hairs on my face and some stress pimples. I followed the directions and broke out in small, itchy red bumps on my face and arms. I'm not sure that the neem did it, but it's a funny coincidence if you ask me. I'm sure ayurvedic medicine works for some, but I'm steering clear of neem. The doctor gave me a cortisone shot and some hydroxyzine to clear it up. He thought it was scabies, but it looked more like contact dermatitis."
1,Not suitable for vegetarians,"Not good for vegetarians, this contains capsules which is derived from gelatin, which is an animal derived product, I subscribed to this product for every month purchase, but when I realized that this is containing animal products based gelatin capsules, I stopped my subscription."
1,Saint George,"When I picked up this book I expected to learn a few interesting facts about Bush Sr., but also to get a good overview of the times he lived in. (Most of which was before I was born) There is a bit of that, but mostly it's a poor attempt at canonization.Over and over again it emphases that George, in spite of his wealthy heritage was humble and kind, all around good guy, great friend of all, etc, etc. I'm sure George was a great guy and quite possibly when the book was written this info needed to be shared. However, for today's student of history reading for interest and entertainment this book just doesn't work."
2,Could this be an imposter?,"Gash's Lovejoy novels are at their best when the author sticks to the setting he knows best: East Anglia's antiques trade. There's nothing more enjoyable than tagging along with Lovejoy as he chases antiques,women,and murderers through the English countryside. When Lovejoy takes off, you need a plot that bolsters the loss of place. ""Paid And Loving Eyes"" is second to only ""The Great California Game"" as the Lovejoy excursion with the most confusing and ridiculous plot. Some passages, especially the maid's sex expoits, include details that Lovejoy hasn't included before or since. This book seems to be written by a lazy Gash or a different person! The latecomer Lovejoy fan will enjoy the antiques lore,but I would not recommend this book to the general mystery fan"
3,5ANs are the best,I love these sticks. I've been playing on them forever and have not been satisfied by any other brand. Now why are these things so f*****g expensive????
5,Amazing!!!!!,"These sticks are the best I have ever owned, and I have been playing for a very long time. They are light, fast, and just perfect for any type of music you play."
5,al foster is a good fit for this album,"although jack dejohnette is one of my favorite drummers, he would not go with this album. al foster is exceptional at keeping a grove and he makes this album. when i first heard this i thought man this guy sucks but then i realized how magnificent his playing really is. on the other hand foster would have not fit very well on live evil - dejohnette is impressive as hell! miles is the man - 5 stars"
5,Great for the tub!!,"I purchased this for my 20 month old son for Christmas. He absolutely loves these for the tub, and can't wait to have a bath!!"
2,Do not fly straight.,"To keep it simple.I bought two sets and both have the same problem. The mid range and driver of both sets are difficult to aim. The driver hooks extremely hard. The mid range a little less but still not true. You have to compensate for the error of the disk, which is no way to play a game based on accuracy. All in all a very weak starter set.Save your money and by individual higher quality disk. Good luck."
5,great starter set,gave these as a gift. they look to be a great starter set. they are good quality for a great price.
5,Walking Along,"This superb film features Meena Kumari, as Shahibjaan, a beautiful dancer and singer. The dancing is truly beautiful, elegant and unforgettable, as is the singing.Credit for the lovely songs must also be given to Ghulam Mohammed, the creator the songs. Kamal Amrohi, a perfectionist, brought true perfection to this fantastic film with his direction. It was also obvious from the film that director loved his subject, Ms. Kumari, his wife in real life. The element of tragedy rings strong in this magnificent film, also reflected in Ms. Kumari's real life.The DVD allows you to watch the songs, again and again. I've always loved the soundtrack/songs, such as Chalte Chalte, and now I have seen them sung and danced by Ms. Kumari. This is a one of the best Hindi language films I've ever see."
5,Different Spenser,"I haven't read all the Spenser books, but this was the most unusual to date. There is much more vulnerability. He's not the typical macho Spenser. There's also more romance than any other Spenser book I've read. I liked that you get to see the real person behind the tough P. I. The plot was still great and it was as fast moving as all the others. I thought it was great, but not the greatest that I've read. If you like Spenser, you definitely have to read this book."
4,Classic Hockey Hit!,Classic hockey cartoon... Remember this from the 70's great way to introduce kids or new hockey parents to the game and rules... Lots of fun!!
2,Temperature not working,"Purchased this product making sure to get the Model ""T"" for temperature. Installed and routed the cable. Put the boat in the water a few weeks later only to find out that the temperature function doesn't work.It took me 2 hours to route the cable (I have many obstructions and tight places). Knowing this, I couldn't be bothered to send it back.Other than having a transducer that is supposed to sense temperature and does not, the unit performs well trolling, at speed and even in reverse with many bubbles. Unit is tight to the bracket and doesn't kick up with rough seas, but does kick up when hit or beached..."
5,"An excellent, funny, calming tool for parenting teenagers.",I discovered Hormones and Wheels through a friend and found the information and suggestions very helpful. Jim Fay presents the material in a humerous way that allows you to identify with common parenting-of-teenager problems while also adapting the suggestions to everyday life. I listen to the tapes in the car and it renews my beliefs that I will live through my 15 and 16 year old sons. Home has become a much more entertaining place to live since reading this book and listening to the tapes.
5,A very engaging read from beginning to end!,"Irv Yalom has done it again: He just keeps getting better. I found the stories gripping and suspenseful, with just the right touch of humor, and the perfect blend of fiction and non-fiction. Dr. Yalom has a real gift for sharing his insights into psychiatry with lay persons as well as medical professionals. Thoroughly enjoyable!!"
5,Great Read,Great read for those interested in the counseling/psychology field. I would not recommend to be used as 'educational' but covers a lot of information on grief. The last two chapters are fictional but the rest are based on real clients.
3,Does not work with MultiMedia extended keys,"This product works well with any standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse. Since this is all it claims to do and this is all you want then I would give it 5 stars. However most newer PS/2 keyboards have extended media keys such a volume, play, etc. and application launch keys. This adapter will not support these extended keys. IF you are looking for the extended media key support then look for an adapter that specifically states that it supports the extended media keyboard features."
4,A solid piece of work,"If you want to know something about Honduran history and politics, if you want to know why that unfortunate land is so unfortunate, read this book. I don't think there is another book which will give you the background so well. It is readable and informative. How well I remember living there many years ago and often finding it difficult to buy a banana in the consummate 'banana republic'. That said it all to me. This book explains why that could be. Read it."
5,Great for kids,Product is great to go along with clay kits. 13 year old loved it and started using it right away with her clay kit.
3,They look great.,They look great but time will tell as to how durable they really are. I use them in school during our winter indoor recess time. Many little hands will be testing the tools.
4,When video game designers write a film script: Galerions.,"This unique computer generated film is like all of the cutscenes pulled from a game and made into a film that you wish they had a game for. It's a good sci-fi/cyberpunk thriller with two music soundtracks. Yeah, two. The original Japanese theme music gives a darker, almost survival horror vibe to the movie while the U.S. remixing of metal and rock tracks have a more energetic pace. Give the U.S. soundtrack a listen, I've gotta hunt down the original next!"
5,Easiest Wax I've ever used,"I'm over 60 and I've used many waxes over the years from the foo foo fancy to the impossible to remove. This one is the best I've ever had.It goes on very easily and almost removes itself. The shine on my dark red vette is a block deep, and the finish just feels slipery. I can't imagine a better product."
4,Accordian for Grandson,This accordion is just as promised. Four year old grandson is able to make good sounding noise with it! We are all happy with it.
1,Buyer Beware!! Bait & Switch,"Should have listened to the other reviewers, complaining about receiving the wrong item. I, too, was sent the Hohner brand. If that was what I wanted (and why would I?? It's awful!) I would have ordered (and paid a lot less for) that. Amazon, get your act together and stop these sellers from this 'bait & switch' tactic. VERY BAD FOR BUSINESS! Don't be fooled into thinking those who received the wrong one are in the minority - I am here telling you we are in the MAJORITY!"
4,Go loud sound,Great for laptops. Loud enough to hear but not enough to annoy others. I used it on an iBook.
3,Ms. John Soda - No P. Or D.,"Ms. John Soda's debut album, _No P or D_, is a pleasantly mellow slice of post-rock electronic pop, a sort of specialty of Morr Music. Although the opening track ""Technicolor"" starts out almost purely abstract, it eventually coalesces halfway through. ""Go Check"" has a perkiness that shifts into an indie rock groove (a vigor that returns with ""Unsleeping""), while ""Solid Ground"" flits around with some simple piano keys and pizzicatos. ""Elusive"" takes the album out on a strong note, the melody rich and delicate. Solid, if ultimately unremarkable."
1,There is no index,"Forewarning. Try a sample first. I downloaded this collection and found it completely useless, being that there is no book index."
5,Dri Wash 'n Guard All Weather Tire and Trim Treatment - Very good product,"I've been using this product for years and prefer it over everything else I've tried. It cleans the road grime off the tires and leaves the them clean but not shiny/wet looking. And since you wipe it off as the second step, there's no liquid to sling onto the paint when you're driving. This product also works well on all black plastic body parts and does a good job of restoring their new appearance."
2,Not a lot of NLP material.,"I thought this book would have more information on how to use NLP for enhancing leadership qualities. Most of what I found was just practical tips on what makes a leader and different leadership styles.The questions posed throughout the chapters mostly ask you to think of qualities you like in different leaders and why you consider that person a leader.If you're looking for pure NLP tips, I would suggest the book ""NLP at Work"". Otherwise, I would suggest skipping this book, unless you are unsure of ""what makes a good leader""."
3,Little seen Karloff/Lugosi team-up is fun classic,"Part sci-fi, part standard mad doctor on murderous rampage, this is nevertheless a must-see for golden age horror buffs. The story of Karloff discovering Radium X and how it turns him into a glowing killer is pretty dated. You'll cringe at some of the ""science"". But the fast pacing, sets and characterizations make this decent fun. Karloff is pretty hammy, and Bela surprisingly not (usually it's the reverse). View this in the context of its time and with the spirit of a Universal horror fan, and The Invisible Ray will give you a pretty electric feeling!"
3,FORGOTTEN KARLOFF & LUGOSI SCI-FI CLASSIC,"This is a film many horror fans pass by but, it is an interesting early Karloff and Lugosi team up. There is no Jack Pierce monster make up in this one but, the FX are very good for the time. The film is available on DVD and the transfer in very good. The set is called the Bela Lugosi franchise collection and it is worth picking up for this and the four other horror films included."
2,not very good,"This film is o.k. But the plot is dumb. Boris Karloff has a bigger part and not a very excing one, than costar Bela Lagosi. The title has nothing to do with the story and the makeup is bad. The film is wierd so I would rather watch The Black Cat, The Raven or Murders in the Rouge Morge."
2,An Okay Sci-fi Movie....,"I am a HUGE Karloff and Lugosi fan. I've lookedall over and finally found this movie hereon Amazon.com, so I snatched it up.This movie is Okay. It didn't grab me. In Fact,I put it on and found myself doing other thingsaround the house. It's a classic and it's good forwhat it is, and for the time that it came out,but I enjoy the Karloff/Lugosimovies The Raven and The Black Cat way more."
2,"Poor quality, get what you pay for I guess","When mine arrived the installed bulb didn't work. Luckily it came with a spare.It's also fairly noisy. Cheap product, good for simple projects but I wouldn't recommend this for serious use."
2,DC plug flimsy,"It works, but the solder is not good- because it will shut off if the cord is bent even slightly. this has occurred with two different units. I had to replace the DC plug with one i bought at Radio Shack."
2,Ancient and Out-of-Touch,"This is a ""Prayer Book companion"" that is ancient and out-of-touch with modern sensibility and approach to God. The wording is stuck in the patriarchal mode, and the view of God is as Father and as fearful lord and king. I was expecting something more in harmony with today's scholarship.However, this said, I will add that this is a valuable addition to the library of anyone who wishes a reference to the approach of previous generations to the One."
4,Very Useful,"Very useful, informative and practical. A valuable tool for archicad users who do want to do quality renderings.Pictures are a little small though"
1,Waste of Time and Money,"I bought this book because of the excellent reviews and I was terribly disappointed. The first 5 pages were good so I kept reading, waiting for something interesting to happen and nothing did. Just alot of talking between two people, on and on. The conversation included rape, torture and other horrific acts that were unspeakable. The characters were boring and without substance. I read about 3/4 of it and had no desire to read the rest. Poorly written and in bad taste."
5,Solid history of the war.,"Of the 82 reviews here so far, only 4 are less that 3 stars. That is because this is a tremendous, if at times plodding, history of the Iraq War. It kept my interest because of the description of the battles and the analysis of the people. It is must reading for everyone who wants a clear understanding of how we got where we are."
3,Cobra II,"Comprehensive narrative, drawing on many resources, describing the War in Iraq. As newspaper reporters are want to do, the author stresses blunders and mistakes of American led forces. He only briefly mentions some successes and acts of heroism. Did not find much in the narrative that identified elements of American competency, suggesting that the overthrow of Sadam ""just happened."" The author neglects Sadam's personal testimony about WMD: he was playing an intentional poker game, wanting the West to believe that he had WMD as a defensive deterrant."
1,Avoid this product,"wasted all day with a SMC barricade wireles router and SMC 2635W wireless adapter. I was getting dropped every couple minutes, so it was impossible to transfer any files of decent size. Talk to tech support half-a-dozen times. First they blamed my cordless phone, so I unplugged it. Next they blamed my cell phone, so I powered it off and called them on a landline. Then they blamed windows xp. I discovered that their driver wasn't signed (not windows logo certified.) SMC owns about 5.9% of the wireless market, LinkSys owns about 50%. Avoid Microsoft too. They are new to the wireless hardware game, and their products aren't well tested either. Good luck!"
3,Firmware not ready for primetime,I have one of these and it locks up occasionally. I feel that SMC did not allow themselves enough time to get the product stable before they sent it out the door.
2,Fine for 100-BaseT. Useless for wireless.,"I bought this router to use for mixed mode (wired/wireless). My initial experience (setup, reliability, price, performance) was excellent using purely wired connections.I recently tried two wireless PCMCIA cards (one Engenius and one Belkin brand) and was very disappointed with connectivity from both. I expected to get 11Mbps up to 50' or so. I could not get ANY connection at 50'. It works fine within 20-30' of the router, but obviously that's not what I bought a wireless unit for."
2,Cheap Products,"I received my first fry cutter in September 2006 which broken within a couple of weeks of receiving. I have given Northern Industrial Tools 2 stars because when I contacted them regarding our broken fry cutter they sent me another, shipped overnight, immediately.When we received the second fry cutter it arrived broken. So, I took the parts that where not broken and put together a complete fry cutter. Within several this one had broken, also.Now, I have two broken fry cutters sitting on my front porch....what should I do with them?Thank you,Linda Allen"
2,For Wimpy fries only,"The frame and handle are built like the proverbial steel outhouse. Unfortunately, the plastic cutter head is another matter. I tried it on a yam and watched the upper,unsecured corner of the cutter head bend out as I had to nearly stand on the handle to push the yam through the cutter. Didn't break, but came close. I also found two other problems: (1) the thing will not take the stronger, all-metal Weston cutter heads -- close to a fit, but no cigar; and (2) while it's an easy matter to change cutter heads (just undo three wing nuts and remove), it's a real pain the neck to change the pusher head. Four small, inaccessible Phillips head screws to undo and replace in order to complete the process. Took me only one day of dealing with this sort of foolishness to call Northern and arrange to return this unit. I'll be ordering a Weston instead."
1,Would not purchase again,"Poorly constructed. Notice only 3 of the 4 corners have wing nuts to hold on the blades. The top corner bends away under pressure, ruining the cutting angle. I've already snapped one bolt.The device doesn't operate smoothly without a load. Not sure how they expect it to cut potatoes. Definitely does NOT slice sweet potatoes. Was able to slice regular potatoes if you cut them down small enough. But who wants short stubby fries?"
4,Rucka's Best So Far,"Greg Rucka wisely shifts the focus of his fourth novel form boyscout bodyguard Atticus Kodiak to tough gal PI Bridgett Logan. While Kodiak is part of the story, this is Bridgett's book and Rucka makes this loud, brassy, somewhat vioelnt femme into a far more intriguing hero than Kodiak could ever be. The plot is a little thin in spots, but it's really an excuse to explore where Logan came from and why she's the way she is. There are moments when I couldn't stop reading and monents where it got so intense that I had to. The only major flaw with the book is that Rucka doesn't quite know how to end it. This seems to be a recurring theme of his career, both in the novels and the comics he writes, but he's getting better with each new work.Defintely recommended for Rucka fans, crime novel readers, and suspense fans."
2,NEED MORE DETAIL,"The reason people might think this is an easy read is because the author lacks detail. I have more questions now, than before I read this book. On page 13 under Standard scales he writes, ""1/125th second at f/16 produces the same amount of exposure as 1/30th second at f/8."" 1/125th second to 1/30th second is 3 stops, but f/16 to f/8 is only 2 stops. The correct aperture would be f/5.6, 3 stops from f/16. To get the same amount of exposure as 1/125th second at f/16 you would use 1/30th second at f/5.6. Everything I want to learn about exposure control is in this book, but the author doesn't go into detail about anything. There's just not enough information. I'm left asking myself, WHAT, WHY, & HUH?"
2,Dictionary not complete enough,"Langenscheidt has always been a name I trust when it comes to German dictionaries, but I was very disappointed with this particular one. I bought it because of its small size to take with me on a recent trip to Germany, but I was continually frustrated when I would look for a word and not find it! And these were not, in my opinion, obscure words. I finally went into a book store in Regensburg, Germany and bought a larger edition, still small enough to carry around, but much more complete with around 137,000 words! I left the smaller one with my sister-in-law for her to use with her grandchildren."
3,canon L,Ok it's built very well and is weather sealed & has a good range 24-105 and IS etc but my copy was very soft and had horrible vignetting on ful frame 5D so i returned it amazon gave me a REFUND .I wish canon had better quality control at this price ok i could send it off to Canon but I don't expect that with a $1200 lens!
1,5 disc great 6th disc a no show,Season series was great until we got to the 6th disc and season final shows we received a 6th disc of a different show all together. We did get are money back but still have no idea how season eleven ended
3,mediocre,i've probably eaten hundreds of lucques olives and hate to say that these were my least favorite. the olives themselves were fine but the brine that they were soaking in had a funny taste that was different than any other i've had before. olives - good. brine - bad.
4,COOL RELIC,This is a great way to introduce a young child to the story and it's not scary at all (unlike the film).
5,An EXCELLENT Book,"Rosie Dunne / Where the Rainbow Ends / Love, Rosie...these are three different titles for this book, but no matter what you call it it's a wonderful story!It's a story about best friends falling in-love and although they take years to admit it they're able to experience a love that most people look for -- unconditional love, surviving through thick and thin, no matter what the odds are! Talk about Fate ... Just goes to show you that if something's meant to be God finds a way to make it happen!Cecelia Ahern is a wonderful author. I also highly recommend her fist book, PS I Love You! .... Keep the tissue box close with both of these books.I just started her book, If You Could See Me Now, and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next! She's wonderful!!"
4,Witty Page Turner,"I didn't expect when I purchased that the whole book was written in emails, letters, and instant messaging. But it was really interesting how you could follow several people's lives this way. I found myself getting all emotional over the characters bad timing. I wish the letters has been dated. You could figure out how long it had been between letters, but sometimes it was hard to tell until the end of a letter. Halfway through I found myself screaming at the main characters -- get together already!!! And why did they wait an extra 10 years at the end??? I liked this book a lot, but I found myself wanting to reach through the pages and meddle with the characters lives myself. I suppose all the feelings it conjured up in myself kept me hooked on the book!Overall, it was witty and a definite page turner. Very quick and easy reading."
1,Tedious boring and pointless,"I like a couple of Cecelia's other books. I don't know why this book was written. The whining, complaining, and victim state of the main character made me want to pull my hair out. Then you have about 10 extraneous characters who have nothing to do with the plot, but you'll read all about their boring, irrelevant lives.Really, really bad."
5,Short review: Great!,"The reviewer (""prenziberg"") who complains of ""venom dripping from nearly every sentence"" has a non-rare ability to extract surprising things from mild-mannered text. In my opinion, what drips from nearly every sentence is clarity. (I know, clarity does not drip. He (she?) started it...)This is, again IMO, one of the great books of historical reportage and interpretation. Stern wrote the book in the 60's; he could have had no inkling of current goings-on in Muslim land, the relevancy of the book to which other reviewers have commented approvingly on.I underlined almost every sentence. I have not done that since my mid-twenties. Either, at 65, I'm loosing it, or the book is pretty good. Both are likely.bill"
1,An Insult,"Graphics are terrible, the artificial intelligence is an insult, and the gameplay lasts for as much as 2 hours. That's it. In 120 minutes, you'll have finished the game and you'll never want to touch it again.I've been fooled.Do not buy this game."
1,Baught it to pass time...oops,"This game was fun at first only because it is incredibly easy. I expected it to get harder as the game went on but it only got easier. It only has 5 battle scenarios. 3 of them are battle fields that you can win without playing at all, your troops will win just by defending them selves. After many of the battles you will have to chase the enemy general on horse back and fire arrows at him. You can't really aim, all you do is fire the arrows and you will beat him. The ninja this is also stupid. I hired one and never got to use it. All in all the game is fun if you don't like being challenged, otherwise its crap. If you are going to buy it, buy it used. It's not worth 30 dollars."
1,Are you kidding me?,HiI have never got this book!Actually I was even thinking that i didn't order this book after month (or what). And there was some kind of mistake in my billing address or somethinhgDid I?Thank you
1,Upside down book - very unhelpful,"I am in Beijing at the moment, working and trying to learn the language and although I don't normally write reivews I was moved to by the sheer illogical nature of this book. The characters are put alongside the English definitions without pinyin to help with the pronunciation! What is the point in learning characters if you can't vocalise them?I cant imagine that there is anyone who wants to learn chinese script without being able to speak first or practice their learning by speaking?!! Even if you want to write first then it would be a good and logical learning tool to be able to learn the sound at the same time as writing the character!!!"
1,Very poor!,"As someone whos family is 1/2 Chinese, and who understands a little Cantonese I found this book almost impenetrable! As early as page 4 it asks you to 'remember' things it never told you! By page 10 the average western reader will have resigned this volume to propping up a wobbly fridge, Which is about as useful as this book will EVER be to it's stated target audience.....I learned more about reading Chinese from my 6-Y/O niece who attends Chinese School!Presumaby Ms Scurfield understands A Chinese language (which one? I wonder!) and logic better than she does English! to the beginner in Chinese this is worse than useless. To those who might have learned a little of one of the spoken Chinese languages...... Well it didn't help me; and I CAN hold my own in Cantonese!Don't waste your money; why they spared ink on this is beyond me!"
4,Interesting and Bluesy Uriah Heep Album,"This album is not bad actually.I had to buy the import origonally as there was no US release at all.True, no Demon and Wizard here - but was a very Bluesy album that had an honest sound to it that was not commercial sounding in any way.Some of the songs are as strong as anything they've written: ""Imagination,"" ""Fools,"" ""Won't Have To Wait Too Long and It ain't Easy.""Trevor Bolder was the star of this album - his song ""It ain't Easy"" was a masterpeice and the one I played constantly off of this album.""Fools"" by him was also fantastic and a classic song worth listening to a thousand times.I didn't know Trevor Bolder could write or sing before - on this album he really suprized me.This album is a must for all Heep fans - Trevor Bolder's finest moments are recorded on this album."
5,A SOUNDTRACK THAT ALSO WORKS AS A SEPARATE ALBUM,"This CD is actually the soundtrack of a film by Steve Lazur (Time of the Earth - A Desert Dreamtime Journey), which is a wordless 77-minute ""audio-visual odyssey"" of the Southwest (canyons, rock sculptures, turbulent clouds, etc.) However, the soundtrack stands on its own.This is a compilation album, with some well-known tracks, as well as some pieces (or excerpts of pieces) that were released on earlier, hard-to-find compilation albums with other artists. The tracks are from a wide variety of Roach's times and styles. It creates a suitably ""atmospheric"" setting, with mostly quiet, non-rhythmic pieces that match the ""open"" mood of the Arizona desert.Even if you have all (or most) of these tracks separately, their unique pairing on this album make it well worth the purchase."
1,A Plethora of Mistakes,"What a disappointment!! I thought I was the dummy until I read this book. It turned out that I knew more than the author, or at least his editor. There are no less than nine mistakes in the first twenty-six pages. We're not talking about errors in judgement; we're talking about very basic, rudimentary rules. For example, The black pawns take their opening position at the seventh rank, not the second rank, as described on page 14. By page 26,I would have been totally confused and frustrated if I did not already know the basic rules of chess.An author who undertakes to write a book for complete idiots has a responsibility to be especially accurate in setting forth the rules of the game."
5,Great introductory guide,"Concisely written that slowly guides players who want to gain a better understanding of how to strategically play (or better yet, at least have a chance vs. more knowledgeable players). Well layed out. One can ease through the text as the information is presented at a liesurely yet practical pace. Refreshing and not overbearing."
2,Sub-par Kindle Version,"I liked the book quite a lot, but have to rate it low because of the poor quality of the text on the Kindle version. For $9.99 and a fairly modern book, why couldn't they have used an original electronic version to create the ebook? The errors are clearly from the scanning process. This is simply inexcusable. The first two books in the series suffered no such issues."
1,The typos border on inexcusable,"I love this story. I am a big fan of Steven Erikson. I'm not sure where this complaint should be addressed but I'm putting it here. Even in modern printing, in scifi/fantasy, there are a couple of misspellings. It happens, made-up names of people and places. I bought the kindle version of this book and it seems that no one checked the book at all after converting to the kindle format. There are misspellings every couple of pages. I've read this book four or five times, so I can figure it out. Someone new to the book must be frustrated, because things don't make sense. This is also a problem with the Kindle edition of Gardens of the Moon, although there were not as many errors. I'm not sure who is responsible for the text translation to kindle format, but it really is a black eye for everyone involved, Tor, Amazon and Erikson."
2,Starting not to care,"I liked book one a good deal. By book three however Erikson has thrown us a ridiculous number of new concepts and characters so it's very hard to keep track. The writing and plot are less tight. Characters ""growl"" a LOT. Major plot points Erikson had set up get overturned frivolously or get lost in a sea of competing grand new ideas. Way too many characters are on the verge of great power. I'm about ready to put down the series. Too bad because book one was quite good."
1,Won't work with Alcatel Modems,I'm glad to see that others are having the same INSANE problems trying this router to connect through the Alcatel modems on DSL connections. This router has taken years off my life.
2,Does not work with Cox Communications Cable Internet,"After struggling for hours, and calling tech support, I took this item back to the store where I bought it. The guy at the returns desk told me that it wouldn't work with Cox Communications' Cable Internet service. Gee guys, maybe you should tell your sales people this... Other than that, it seems simple to use IF it works with your system."
3,What's Your Motivation?,"I believe that one does not just come upon a book such as this without being on a personal spiritual quest of a sort. To process its contents, my suggestion would be to know what drives you and what you seek before reading it. With a mind opened to a non-orthodox interpretation of the life Jesus may have led, this book could prove quite stimulating, and could serve as an invitation to broaden one's meditations even on the lives of Joseph and Mother Mary. However, if one is not prepared for such an alternative view, the experience would be more shocking than beneficial."
1,APPALLING!,"Even though this book was written back in the 70's it amazes me that it's still in print! Morrison is grossly ignorant about a great many things. One, she claims to be a Satanic Witch! Satan is a Christian invention and Wiccans don't believe in this entity. Understanding this, one can clearly see that a concept such as ""Satanic Witch"" is highly inconceivable! Also, many of her spells are contridictory to the Wiccan Rede. She clearly doesn't understand what she tries to write about. Try Cunningham or Buckland. Thy're worth their weight in GOLD!"
1,Absolute Falsehood,"I naively picked this book up in hopes of learning simple spells for everyday occurences...not only does this book NOT focus on witchcraft as a religion, it completely violates the Three-fold Law (Three times what you give returns to you..) AND the Wiccan Rede ""Do as thoug wilt AS LONG AS IT HURTS NONE."" Forcing a man to fall in love with you is a hurtful thing. It upsets me to think that some of the newer generation witches will be picking this up and reading it, possibly even taking it seriously and making it part of their practices. This book, to be perfectly blunt. I'm sorry a tree had to die for the pages, and that she made money off of this. END"
3,Just for fun- no experts,The reviews are so mixed. I say it is a fun book-that's all. Pro's would be sickened at it's lack of details.
4,Not As Bad As Some Think It Is ..,"Do the wiccans think that everyone interested in magick is also interested in wicca as a religion? Well, news flash -- we aren't. Not all of us want to be wiccan and are pretty fed up with the self-serving single-minded attitude wiccans seem to have. With all things in life, we take the consequences of our actions. Sometime those consequences are good, other times bad. It is up to the individual, not the wiccans. This book wasn't the best-written on the subject and the author tended to sound like she was smoking more than cigarettes, but it was entertaining and somewhat informative. Not nearly the Necromnicon that the wiccans are making it out to be! I mean, geez, bury this book in a tin box and compost it??? Sounds like censorship to me."
1,Wiccans please stop screaming--you're making us look bad,"Now, while I find Ms. Morrison's book offensive and her attitude toward Wiccans very sad, having read the reviews posted here I can almost understand her opinion. In her book she makes no claim to be Wiccan, and it is arrogant to assume that everyone who practices magic belongs to the Wiccan faith. That being said, I have a terrible fear that young people are going to read this horrible book and think it IS Wiccan, or that yet more people will hate us based on Ms. Morrison's work. Surely she must have known how dangerous it is to publish a work with ""black magic"" treated as a serious practice; like it or not, authors have a responsibility toward their readers, and she has set herself up for some serious karmic kickback with this one. It is sensationalism, pure and simple, and I felt dirty after reading it."
1,Horrid,"Normally, I don't bother to review a book if I didn't like it but this book disgusted me to the point where I had to comment. First off, let me say to any of you that are thinking about trying any of the ""spells"" in the so-called black magic section; be careful what you wish for. Magick is not a revenge tool, nor is it someting to merely toy with. If you were to actually succede in preforming some of these ""spells"" (which is highly unlikely due to the fact that the instructions on how to raise and release energy are rather sketchy) you will be karmicly responsible for your actions. If you want to learn magick without changing your religion I suggest you look toward the more ""earthy"" magicks such as Earth Power by Scott Cunningham"
1,PLEASE DO NOT READ!!,"OK well I am not trying to offend anyone who really enjoyed this book BUT in my opinion this was quite awful. 1st of all for everyone out there who chooses to be a wiccan or practice witchcraft do not read this book thinking it has everything you need to know, or even has ANYTHING you need to know. This woman should not be teaching this sort of thing, she teaches controlling magick, black magick, voodoo magick and torture magick which is completely un-wiccan and goes against the craft of the old religion. I am not saying you cannot do the magick in here but NEVER think that it is what the religion is about. IF there was a 0 stars option I would have chosen it. PLEASE DO NOT READ JUST THIS BOOK!! look around I hope that you will find better magick ( i know its out there)"
2,Fun but not terribly useful,"This just isn't a very good spellbook. Not because she has black magic in it personally I think the Wiccans need to lighten up, but because it just isn't that useful. The spells don't lend themselves to be personalized which causes problems unless ou want exactly what the author did. Also most of them don't really have any room to build up power and focus. There is one excpetion. the magic ESAU square talisman seemed to be a very interesting spell.I've owned this book for about 5 years and to be honest I've never even tried one of her spells. They might work, but it seemed easier to belnd candle magic and herbs and the like and go from there. A lot of her spells involve visits to th ejewlery store to have things specially made. So before you buy it flip through and ask yourself do I really see myself doing this? (be sure to check out the ESAU talisman I mentioned)."
1,out of date,"Many of the practice examples do not work with Visual Studio 2008.Much has changed since the publishing of this book. And if you are keeping up with the new technology of Microsoft this book is outdated. Published in 2002, the new paradigm is WCF.I would like to see and own a book that explains the new WCF, with database examples to AdventureWorks, Microsofts practice database you can download and work examples.That is my humble two cents review.Thank you,-robert"
1,Deceptive,"I bought this book hoping for some kind of strategy points on the hitting lottery. What this book gives you instead is a course in ""positive thinking"" which would be fine, if I were buying a book on that subject. Winning the lottery and this book have nothing in common."
4,Emergency: the Final Resue.,"This video was the last in the series that entertained my daughter for years. Not as good as all the other seasons, but worth completing the collection."
5,Emergency The Final Rescues,What a deal! I would have paid much more in a conventional store if I did not order through Amazon. I am a big Emergency fan and now can say I got all of my episodes through Amazon and saved a lot of money in the process. Emergency is worth buying.
3,The Final Rescues,"I really enjoyed seasons 1-6 of Emergency but to be honest these were a little disappointing. The movies were mainly created because the two main stars were still under contract, and they were shows to introduce new shows. Johnny and Roy had very small parts in these ""episodes."" They were each about an hour and a half, maybe a little longer, and some of them half of the episode is the engines driving to the accident. Some are better then others of course. It is a part of the collection, so I do recommend it but just be aware of what you are going to be watching."
2,Cheated,"We own every season of Emergency and were really looking forward to Emergency: The Final Rescues, but were greatly disappointed. It appears as if the final season was used as either a testing ground or launch pad for other series the network owned. While Roy and Johnny are featured in the final episodes of the series, albeit sparingly, nobody else from the Station 51 or Rampart gangs joins them. In this age where television shows offer actual series finales so the viewing public can say goodbye to old friends, Emergency apparently ended, very quietly, the year before the final season aired."
3,"some okay, others disappointing","The first two movies were just okay. As other reviewers reported, there are few scenes of Roy and Johnny. The greatest rescues are a highlight of some of the rescues from the seasons of the show so all about the two and the original cast. The two movies based in San Francisco seem kind of out of order because they are not captains yet; but they are in the movie more than the first two movies. They only help with the rescues though. The ratio of them in the scenes is about the same as the series when they divided the time between the hospital and the rescues. As others reported, the crew of 51 are not in the movies except for the ""greatest rescues"" because they are the flashbacks of previous rescues. All in all, if you love Emergency! you may want this to complete your collection, but don't expect the same as from the series."
1,...,"This is my first exposure to a Jake Bernstein book and I've read many mixed things about him. Well, after reading most of this book .. I'm glad i now have my own opinions.This book appears to be written for a total beginner futures trader lemming, just waiting to blow out their account. There is absolutely no substance in this book, nothing to be learned and filled with verbose junk about indicators, patterns and psychology -- typical in most books. Jake provides numerous so called ""backtests"" of various indicator settings with variable moving averages. Every single system has different settings - which is such an obvious sign of curve fitting. The only thing I saw of some value was the 3 period high and low moving averages to serve as channels of support and resistance .. which a trader may be able to modify into something usable, since Jake's version is taught improperly.I checked this book out from the library and I still feel I got ripped off .. and it was free."
3,To Hell and Back,"I did not find this to be a strong entertaining read, but very informative and worthwhile if you are into this sort of thing."
2,Not certain what to feel,"The novel is supposedly non-fiction/journalism, however, I have to say that I seriously doubt the validity of this drug ridden tale. Either way, I didn't hate the book but I didn't like it either. I'm lost as to why it was even penned other than to show the seriously demoralising drug addictions that existed in the 70's and still exist to this day.I'm seriously grasping for straws to find some sort of point to this implausible tale of nonsensical, sleep deprived days and nights of a journalist and his attorney.I didn't find any humor and I walked away with another book read but without a deepeded sense of educational value. The book is what it is, a fast read read about a myriad of drugs that fail to kill off two fools."
5,"Buy the ticket, Take the ride","Thompson's Fear and Loathing is a savage burn on the American mind. And it should be noted that this book is much more then drug induced babble. It is Thompson's writing that brings you to the depths of an Either binge and back, it will suck you in and spit you out with his legendary Gonzo style writing. However this book is more then just great fiction, it is a record of the last gasp of incorruptibility in American life that was lost not so long ago.Thompson's book earns the right to called one of the great American novel's, if not the great American novel of the last thirty years."
5,abondon hope...,"Have you ever read a book that shakes the very foundations of what the human psyche can take in a short amount of time,and causes you to rethink everything you thought a book could do?This book WILL change your life,love it or despise it you will never forget it.Some books are normally described as a 'white knuckle rollercoaster ride' this will prove that they are no more than invalid carts with dodgy electrics and two flat tyres. But take heed DO NOT try to emulate this man, I've tried, and it's not fun."
4,very funny book,"Up there with Bukowski as ""must read but be prepared"", I've been avoiding Fear and Loathing for a while for no particular reason. I'm glad I finally broke down and read it, it's really a great book!"
5,Oh the irony!,Does anyone else find the title of this book absolutely histerical!!!My first thought was this is a book about the travels of the male population of Minneapolis!
3,Good,Needed them for a sick dog. Could not find them anywhere locally and was relieved to be able to find them online. Took a little while to get them but it was exactly what was needed.
3,"Nice cable, but ...","It has always bothered me that I have to buy the cables separately from the KVM. I mean it stands to reason that if I have a need for a KVM switch then I must need at least two cable sets <sigh>Having gotten that rant out of the way, the cables are fine. I like that the cables have a single head on the KVM side and are molded together. It keeps things a little more organized behind the boxes ... or saves the expense and work of using some cable bundling scheme.So over all the cables are solid and work well."
5,Couldn't have built my Hiawatha without it!,"I built my Hiawatha over 12 years ago using this book. I had not one idea about carpentry, the mechanics of wood, or anything related to boat building. I remember poring over this book in my ""thinking"" chair (an absolute necessity in any shop)and following, to the best of my ability, the instructions that were put forth. I'm sure there may be other books out there that will help you with building your own, but this is at the top of my list and worth every penny. Also, the process of building the canoe took me about a year, but I feel confident that I could make one now, start to finish, in about two-three months. It helps that I have a shop full of tools, but I originally built this canoe with the bare minimum as identified in ""Canoecraft."""
1,Why bother? Recycled PD content!,I recently found all 4 of these episodes (plus 15 more) on www.archive.org. These episodes are now in the public domain.
3,Fun toy but microphone stopped working within a few days,My son loves this piano with stool and microphone. The microphone quit working after a few toys. I emailed IDig and they responded immediately and said they would have Simba-the manufacturer 2 day air me the whole product for a replacement. After 2 weeks I checked with them and they apologized and contacted Simba again. 3-4 days later I received a free-standing microphone from them. It works and my son likes it too. I commend IDig toys for their courtesy.
5,"""Pariah States"" & Sanctions in the Middle East","This is a excellent book that is well-written and full of insight and wisdom. Tim Niblock draws on his extensive experience in the Middle East to provide an informed and accurate assessment of the political economies of Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. In the process, he presents a skillfully constructed and cogently argued assessment of the impact of sanctions on the governments and peoples of Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. He emphasizes the limited impact of sanctions regimes as a means to modify public policy in general and to create a stable international environment in particular. This book should be mandatory reading for the bureaucrats, politicians, and diplomats involved in imposing sanctions regimes around the world."
5,BIB FROGG TOGS,"THESE ARE THE SECOND PAIR OF FROGG TOGS I HAVE OWNED JUST WORE THE OTHER PAIR OUT. THESE ARE THE BEST WARM, WATER PROOF ITEMS I HAVE EVER OWNED. HAVE TALKED FRIENDS INTO PURCHASEING THESE FOR SKING. I PURCHASED A PAIR FOR MYSELF AND MY HUSBAND FOR A FISHING TRIP TO ALASKA. IT RAINED ALL DAY THE FIRST DAY OF FISHING AND WE STAYED HIGH, DRY AND WARM. YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH ANY FROGG TOG ITEM"
5,love it,"My husband works out in the elements and he found it worked as advertized in the rain, keeping him dry."
3,Same book as his later titled book,This is the same book as his later titled Gin Rummy: How to Play and How to Win.
2,Poor Value,"I bought this and Brown's Intro to NT. The Brown book, at 1/3 the price is superior in the quality of the book itself, and in my opinion, in the writing as well. That said, Kee's book is a good intro to the NT - just fantastically overpriced for what you get."
1,dorktastic,"ummm, so these goggles totally suck! even though they're fully adjustable they don't keep a good seal and leak really bad. i agree with one of the the reviewers and think you should NOT buy goggles online. go to your nearest sports equipment store and try on a bunch and then look for deals online.these goggles are really dorky looking on too:("
1,This Michele watch is fake!,This watch is a replica of the real thing therefore should not be advertise/sold as the real watch.
5,Awesome!,"I love my Michele Watch it's so beautiful in person, and it's beautifully made you can see the numbers, and the detail on the watch is amazing. Thank you Amazon what a great savings. What a Big Purchase! I'm very Happy!"
1,"Omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent . . . but no 'om.'",For an account of how this translates into 'reality' - there is no better place to look than the WBO Files web-site. Keep a plastic bucket handy.http://www. ex-cult. org/fwbo/fwbo files.htm
5,Ignore the negative reviews,"This is the best book on Thai cooking I have come across. I beleive it would be the only book I would like to be a castaway with. I have a great collection of cook books , including all the classics but this is rapidly becoming my favorite. The recipies work, the text is personal and friendly, and the illustrations marvelous. The Thai names for the recipies are funny and authentic but not found in other books. This adds to the fun of cooking the food.I have just returned from Koh Samui where I had Thai cooking classes and these recipies are right in line with what I learned. The American sustitutions are helpful for cooking here but the book tells how to be authentic too. Actually I have found most of the strange ingredients fresh here in good old Texas.I hope to visit the author's restaurant someday. A truely wonderful book. Buy it now."
5,An Inspiration to my Daughter and Me,"Brad Cohen's book has helped me to gain new insights into Tourette Syndrome, my child, and the power of perseverance. We met Brad at a camp for childen with TS put on by TSA Texas for the last three years. Brad comes all the way from Atlanta to work as a counselor for the weekend with one group of kids. Having met him I already knew he was a special man. Having read his story, I realize how much he has overcome and accomplished.This is a MUST read for any parent of a child with TS, a teacher of a child with TS, or just anyone wanting to learn the power of perseverance. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
5,ideas galore,"WOW. This book is amazing. I am taking my first writing course and was suffering for ideas for what to write about. A friend recommended this book to me and I haven't been able to stop writing since. The Writer's Block is a small book - 3 x 3 x 3 [handy to fit in your bag!] that has a story idea on every page. Some are writing exercises, some are an image and a 'spark' word, and others are an author's view on writing and how to write. A must-have for anyone who writes!"
5,The perfect Gift for the writer in your circle...,"My husband bought this book for me and I love it. It's cute, it's useful and it's fun. Just flipping through it, I came up with so many useful ideas.This little block book makes ya think. It caused me to ponder events long ago, and rework them into my current book. It really is helpful. I like the one word nudges....words that spark your thinking, bring up different kinds of images. For example, the word LOST. Lost Dog? Lost Soul? Lost child? Sooo many possibilities.A great gift for a writer, or for anyone who likes to keep a journal. Fabulous, creative idea. If you write, you will LOVE this little book."
2,Creative Indulgence,"This would probably have been a pretty good book, had the writer chosen to present substance, rather than focusing on being cutesy. The 3"" X 3"" size, which makes it difficult to read, is a serious distraction."
4,"""Block""- buster!",Guaranteed to end your writer's block --- I recommend this book to anyone who writes!I have thoroughly enjoyed it!
5,Perahia is the greatest pianist of all time,"This set really proves why Perahia is the greatest pianist to ever live. It may not be difficult for a concert pianist to ""play"" Mozart. But I've never heard it played this way...not Brendel, Barrenboim, Ashkenazy (though hes a close second), nobody. Perahia simply, makes the music perfect. Sometimes too perfect in fact. This set includes some annoying splices, and there is an analog hiss. Not really bothersome to me though. One thing I will say that bothered me, is that my set came without liner notes. I don't know if this is supposed to be. For those who enjoy further background on the music theyre listening to and are not Mozart veterans, may be disappointed with the lack of information in this set. Otherwise, this set is the greatest one. Check out Perahia's Bach, Beethoven and Chopin as well."
2,Disappointed Old Timer,"I'm definitely not the target audience at 34 years old. I did like the idea of real-time 'combat'/movement. I enjoyed Zelda Phantom Hourglass, but could not get into this one. I played about 6 hours of gameplay...enough to go through several parts of the story and fight my a tank battle. I realize that others enjoy this game, but unfortunately I could not get into it.I enjoy the old Dragon Quest games along with the Final Fantasy games. If you like those, then you might be interested in Dragon Quest Monsters:JokerI'm still looking for a good 'real-time combat' game other than Zelda. Something in the form of the old Secret of Mana games! (I've tried the newer ones :( )"
2,Way to repetitive,"I'm writing this review simply because I was shocked to see this game had a 5 star review. This game is fun... at first. However, you begin to realize that the game has you doing the same thing over and over again. body slam enemies and items and throw them onto a train for stocking, or into a cannon for ammo. I played this game for about 5 days. The first day I really enjoyed It, and found it both engaging and different. By the second day I was wondering when it was going to start to get more challenging. and by the fifth day I had beaten it and was so sick of the repetitive game play that I had no interest in the tank master mode or any other replay value and returned it to the store. I think children under the age of 10 will get alot out of this game, and it might even be a good introduction to the RPG genre. Anyone looking for a game with substance will be thoroughly dissapointed."
3,Er season 13,"The product was brand new! We were very happy with our purchase! The shipper, however, did not ship the product for at least 5 business days so it took us a while to get the product to us!"
5,ER: The Complete Thirteenth Season,"It's ER - what can I say? If you don't watch this series, you don't know what you are missing!"
4,Another great season,This season was not the best but since I am a huge Abby and Luka fan I did like it.
4,I remember this book!,"AND I remember the author! He was my boss many years ago. He gave me a compimentary copy and I read it straight through one weekend. It's a good book. I couldn't put it down, so I certainly recommend it highly."
2,"Not bad, but not as helpful as I thought it would be.","After I started reading the book, I immediately found it difficult to follow. It was not well organized, as topics jumped around dramatically becoming a bit annoying. It seemed as if the author just had everyone on their email distribution list send in tips, and then they pasted them all together without little thought and hurriedly put out the book. Also, what cracked me up was the drawing of a teddy bear next to a lamp. (Any live-aboard, or boater for that matter, would know not to have any combustible materials next to a heat source!) A lot of the tips were sophomoric and not very helpful to experienced boat live-aboarders. Not a horrible book, but definitely not as good or as helpful as I had hoped it would be."
1,Absolute Junk,"Not much else to say. This just didn't work. Even the manufacturer has abandoned it. Their website makes little mention of it, and includes no device drivers. I bought it on closeout simply for its reputed ability to provide an analog to USB interface to digitize some VHS tapes. It didn't work. Also, it gets very hot. Removing the case and adding heatsinks to the hottest components was an exercise in futility...didn't change a thing.I did find the included DVD-authoring software to be somewhat useful, if one already has digital video files. Not recommended...."
5,A Super Greatest Hits Collection,"This IMPORT edition of Belinda Carlisle's Greatest Hits has a larger selection than ""Her Greatest Hits"" CD. Make sure you get the BONUS CD with it (some dealers sell only the main CD) as the bonus tracks are Dance/Extended Versions of several of the hits (my favorite is Summer Rain-Justin Strauss Mix). My only regret is ""Mad About You"" is not included, although you'll find ""Big Scary Animal"" is (which is not on ""Her Greatest Hits"" CD)."
4,Fun toy,"I bought this for my nephew who loves balls and throwing balls (18 months). Since this ball is plush, he can throw it without hurting his brother or anyone else."
3,cute but small,"I was suprised how small the toys were. I do like the fact that the squirt hole is on the front end of the toys. It makes it more fun to shoot, aim and score when your in playing in the tub with your little one. It has a good squirt stream"
4,Good for undergraduate students,"The book shows the different topics about operations management with several excercises and mini-cases. The mini-cases are not so complex. These mini cases are designed for tools applications but don't help to build a business system concept or a bussiness problem, something very important for MBA students. That is the reason because this book is appropiate for undergraduate students in Bussiness or as a complement material for graduate students.Also, the book needs to improve the explanation of process choice or process tipology, both for goods and services. It is something confuse.I have the spanish edition book with a software (POM) in a CD included. This software has some applications as forecasting, linear programming, proyect management, mrp, among others,in a simple format. But POMS for Windows (H.Weiss), DS for Windows(H.Weiss) and HOM software have more modules and let you try more complex situations."
4,Ho-lee Floater dog toy,"It came on time and seemed like the description. I gave it as gift, and I understand my son's big dogs enjoy playing catch with it and have not yet chewed it up."
3,Welcome back Bob,"While this album is not as good as the classic Moby Grape albums,it does have some good songs. Bob Moseley has aged well and his voice is in top form. He's a pretty good guitar player as well as a bass player. He sings the song ""Never"", which Led Zeppelin rewrote as ""Since I've Been Loving You"" as well as other songs that range from electric blues to blue-eyed soul to country-rock. He and his fellow Moby Grape mates should get back together and do a live album with these songs as well as the classic Grape numbers, and his the other members solo numbers. What is really needed is a Live Grape album from around 1968 with a version of Skip Spence's ""Dark Magic"""
3,Lacks better overall support,"I recently installed this product using a 6.0 case.Pros= well made, fairly easy to installCons/ the nylock nuts will make you use foul language. The mount puts the gun case pretty high up which makes some trail riding interesting. I did hit a few trees which didnt phase the case or bracket mount. I did modify the case slightly because there is no support for the barrel end of the case, the bracket is just made as a glorified holster of sorts. Hole on upper end of case does not line up with the Koplin 6.0 case, will not be able to use supplied cotter pin."
4,Highly Recommended,"Don't be fooled by the title of this book. It's not really about any ""three rules"" at all, or how to write fiction either, but instead delves into the what, where and who of fiction. The ""what"" section, dealing with plot motivators and ""story spicers"" and comprising a third of the book, is worth the price alone. Noble offers an excellent analysis of what moves stories along. In the process he shows writers how to steal (yes, steal!) from others to make their stories work in a dramatic, cohesive fasion. The ""where"" and ""who"" sections will prove less useful to experienced writers, but the ""what"" section makes this book a truly invaluable and unique resource for writers of all levels. Screenwriters should also find this section helpful in streamlining their plots."
2,Silly without being especially funny...,"I like trying all sorts of gay film titles, and in my experience comedies usually have a rougher go of it than dramas, which is too bad because we all need to laugh..."
2,Just Fair,"The Magic of Flight"" is just fair. Its only redeeming value is that it's only $14, Blu-Ray and eye-poppingly vivid. As one reviewer noted, however, they've attenuated the sound so much that the aircraft sound wimpy. This DVD certainly won't benefit from a good sound system.And, at 37 minutes, it's a paltry offering. And probably 8 minutes of the 37 are devoted to the history of flight."
3,Not enough flying,"It's a good enough feature to interest you, but for the hardcore aviation enthusiast, you'll probably be left wanting for more. However, it is good for the new aviation enthusiast."
3,Better on the IMAX screen,"This is a great film to see on the IMAX screen.It doesn't do it justice on the average TV set.If you an aviation enthusiast you will like this DVD.The Blue Angels make Top Gun look like beginners.The only thing i didn't like was the soundtrack music.What's with the Hillbilly music?It should have the music from Top Gun.If you can , rent this before you decide to buy."
2,"Good flight Scenes, boring narrative",Tom Seleck narrats this film and he is way to dry! You look at the box and think you are getting a whole bunch of flight scenes when you are lucky if you get 10 minutes. Too much time talking on how flight was developed. Thats OK if that is what you are looking for.
4,I like it,"This bra gives me a smooth back. It could be longer, but i like the smooth back look, especially when i wear Tee Shirts."
2,Giving it away,It doesn't fit well and actually makes the bra bulge worse plus it rides up. I'm so disappointed in it that I'm giving it to Goodwill. The Bali brand is better.
2,Ho Hum,"This game was a real let-down. The proverbs are mildly amusing, but once you figure out what they are there is no incentive to ever play the game again. I wish I had my money back!"
4,Great information!,"Great stuff, could have been half as long, she repeats herself often (she says so we'll remember). Got it the first time."
5,A great gift !!,"As the office party organizer I purchased this tray 2 years ago for a coworker's retirement. I loved it so much I bought one for myself. It is very impressive looking and feels substantial to lift. It is perfect for entertaining. Easy to clean, no polishing and if stored in view makes a beautiful decorative piece. The herringbone weave on the tray serving area keeps scratches from serving utinsels from showing. This piece will be used and enjoyed for MANY years."
4,A major addition to aussie culture,"Okay that might sound like a patronising Englishman's view, and I admit to being surprised how strong the music scene is in Melbourne. From being a Paul Kelly sideman, on harmonica, I didn't expect him to have such a mature and soulful voice. All songs on the cd were written by Wilson, and though they may lack a little originality in style, I cannot be disappointed by the variety and what he puts into them. I haven't heard any previous recordings, but saw a gritty, bad tempered and very satisfying performance by him and a 5 piece in a Melbourne hotel, The Espy. Contrast that with a big venue show in Sydney where he was solo with a sit down acoustic guitarist-emotional, gut wrenching, tender and powerful. These two sides have been caught in the studio, although the heavy blues band only has about four of the 22 tracks. Catch the tale of 'Little Richard''s pearls lost in Sydney Harbour!A CD I'm proud to have found."
2,"Poor writing, disappointing!","I am a fan of good writing and vampire stories. I have read all of Laurell K. Hamilton's collection and am impressed with Chelsea Quinn Yarbro. The story about a vampire in gangster Chicago seems to have promise, but the writing in this book is amateurish. The characters are not believable or well developed. The story is completely told and in very few instances shown; this cheats the reader of the action and of the character struggle. It is impossible for all of those things to have happened in the span of one night. Overall, I was disappointed."
2,Nice looking but clip tears out,Made it two months before the leather tore allowing the clip holder to pull out. Tried another and same thing. Nice fitting and looking but not durable. I am hard on phones.
5,Absolutely amazing!,"I read this book for my microbiology class. It was amazing. The case stories were so interesting, I didn't want to put the book down! 5 stars all the way :)"
2,Live at the isle of fehmarn,"I missed the chance to get this CD on the official homepage of dagger records,because it`s sold out.Over there it was arround 13 US dollar...and it`s not too much more worth than that.I ordered it on AMAZON USA for an astronomical amount,I applied for a master card,that I may never ever need in my life again, to process the payment.....sorry,just for sentimental reasons.That`s all.I`m from northern Germany and Fehmarn is one good hour by car away from my home and Jimi played his LAST gig over there.And one of my friends was present at that day of september.AN THAT`S THE ONLY REASON...to spend over 60 US dollar for this record !!!There are TONS of better CDs with Jimi on,the sound on this record is ...UUUUAAAAHHHH!!!!I guess,it`s only on market because of sentimental reasons anyway..."
1,Cheap and Boring,"My Dad bought this game as a joke for me last Christmas. Granted, I was 16 at the time, but it was still boring. All one does is circle the board until somebody lands on an autopsy square (there are very few of these). An attempt is made to get out the organ, and if one fails, the alien lets out an annoying, meek scream. If an autopsy square isn't landed on, all one can do is continue circling the board until by chance it is landed on. The battery box is indeed taped to the bottom of the board. When I opened mine, the box fell off and the ""tweezers"" wouldn't shut all the way, making them extremely difficult to use. We were both disappointed, having expected it to be funny and creative. It was not. I would go for the real Operation game, or, if a paranormal theme is in mind, hit up a different version of a similar game. There are a few out there."
2,Redesign Needed....,"This is a Great Spin on the old ""Operation"" Game, but unfortunately it's not made as well. The biggest flaw in the game's construction is the thin and flimsy plastic body. If the manufacturer were to redesign the game and use the same type of plastic molding used in the ""Operation"" game, it would Definitely be a Winner, and justify the game's price."
3,"OK, but a bit disappointing","Cute, but in all honesty, I expected more. They don't seem to make stuff like they used to, these days."
4,Relatively unheard of in the U.S.A.,"Pete Murray is Australia's answer to the likes of Jack Johnson, Mason Jennings. Very versatile with some mellow acoustic sounds and some old fashioned rock mixed in. He is simple and good. Hugely popular down under."
3,Nor bad for the price,I originally wanted a metal rather than plastic but could not find one. This product is a little flimzy but it does do the job. I don't forsee it lasting a long time but it will be just fine for the small amount of cans I get around the house. Price was right too.
4,4.5 star Can Crusher,"What a great item. It works like a charm, with two minor issues. When there are 10 cans in, sometimes the top one will pop out. The other is that sometimes the last two cans will pop up and you have to stick your hand in to lay them flat again. With that being said - I crushed thirty pounds of cans in a matter of hours. If you go thru a lot of cans this is the can crusher for you."
2,Plastic,cannot say much for I had sent this back for it was very plastic and i did not want to take the chance of it breaking on the first several uses..
4,It crushes!,"The picture is a little deceiving, the quality is lacking for 30.00 dollars. It does function as described and I like it but over priced by 15.00 easy."
2,Easy setup is a plus,"It is easy to set up; the instructions are clear and are easy to follow. However, the can holder parts are rather flimsy and the snaps can be easily undone"
1,Disappointed,"The product was not at all what I expected, the frame is extremely flimsy and tends to fall off. Can not be used unless attached to a wall which was not what I wanted."
3,Okay.,"It crushed the can wierd. I don't really like it too much, its plastic and feels like its about to break with every can but it is still working for now."
4,Good choice,This can crusher was exactly what I was looking for it works great and will also crush 16 oz cans but only one at a time.
5,Crush-a-holic,"Awesome, I cant stop crushing cans its so fun my kids can't wait to crush cans.Bought one for my father also, my Mother loves it too."
1,"Can RAM ""Garbage""",If one plans to use this for crushing any number of cans please do not waste your money on this piece of garbage. The design is good however the materials used to make it are at best substandard.
1,Worthless for me,"The phone I was using this would not allow this adapter, the plug on the adapter was not long enough. Gave it to goodwill."
4,Spindle/mandrel Installation made by Stens,"Unlike the other reviewers I wasn't quite as happy. I received this late on a Friday and went to install it when I realized that the mounting holes in the spindle were not tapped. It is now Monday and I just talked to their Customer Service and find out that it needs self tapping screws to install it. I did not see this stated anywhere when I ordered it that I needed additional hardware to install nor was it mentioned in the part shipping info. I will now tap the holes myself and reuse the original mounting screws 3/8 x 16. If I had known that I was supposed to use self tapping screws, I would have been able to install it. As it was I didn't know if I had the wrong part or the part was right and they forgot to tap the holes when it was being manufactured. The part looks excellent other than this hiccup!"
3,gets the job done... sort of,"Easy to carbonate as long as EVERYTHING is chilled first, but the real problem is that the water gets a metallic taste FAST, drink the day you put the water in the siphon."
2,Great while it lasted,"When I first bought my siphon, it was great. I had delightfully carbonated water, and I didn't have to lug big heavy bottles home from the store. Then the novelty wore off, and I stopped buying cartridges, and almost forgot I had it. When I pulled it back out, it no longer worked. Others have written about the failure of the charging, and the water and CO2 leaking - that's what it does.Now I'm looking for a new one... but it won't be another ISI."
4,Great small-serving soda maker,"This is a great addition to a couple's or single's kitchen. It makes enough seltzer for several large glasses. It's very easy to operate and the seltzer is quite fizzy. It's perfect for 'sparkling' glasses of fruit juice or for 'spritzing' wine coolers. My only complaint is that there is a persistent drop or two of leakage from the spigot. I cover it with a small balloon, so it's no big problem."
3,ISI soda syphon,"Some of the soda water gets lodged in the bottom of the vessel and is wasted for soda water. Also, the first couple of squirts have way too much pressure and totally spray my wine or juice from the glass I intend to serve in, yet more waste.Good looking and easy to use and hold."
3,Siphoning strength,"Good, sturdy, even good looking. Wish it had more capacity to avoid going trough the refill routine so often. Buy it."
2,"It was great, until it broke.","This thing works really well, and it made me look really stylish offering up seltzer to all my buds at parties, but then it broke. Every time I screw in a charger all the gas goes straight out the nozzle. I had had it less than a month, but I dilly-dallied on making a return and now it's too late, so now I'm stuck with this broken piece of crap."
4,Great little fizzy water maker,"This is my second bottle that I bought as a gift for a friend. My first still works flawlessly for over a year now (I am using at least 2 CO2 per day.) This new one has defective spout (that let the CO2 out) but with a quick replacement from Amazon, my friend is now happily using the new fizzy water maker. Definitely do not over-fill the water and shake it after CO2 went in to make sure that it dissolves into the water. It has been known for the fizz to last more than a day (only when I'm away for the weekend).No more hauling water bottles from supermarket and recycling those plastic bottles."
3,Meh,It works but the water isn't nearly as bubbly/acidic as I like it. I tried using two cartridges but that's more than the seals are rated for. I ended up building my own carbonation system and I'm MUCH happier with it.
4,Fine Austrian Craftmanship,"Pro's:-Excellent, sturdy construction-Best tasting fizzy water I've ever had-Easy-to-follow instruction manualCon's:-Seems like you have to use only isi's chargers (see my review of100 ea Leland Soda Chargers Seltzer Chargers CO2-Leaks a little every-time I use itOverall:-Happy with my purchase and the fact that I'm saving money and the environment by not buying ton's of soda cans and bottles"
4,"A little less capacity than I expected, but...","We've been using this siphon for a few months now, and I still love it. A few things:1) It works best when everything is *cold*. Even when it isn't filled, I still keep it in the fridge.2) It tastes best with filtered water.3) It is plenty fizzy for me4) If you buy your CO2 cartridges in bulk, I've found that the price is really reasonable. The only thing is that the capacity seems a bit smaller than I expected. I get maybe three glasses of water out of it before I have to refill.5) Getting the hang of screwing in the CO2 cartridge is tricky at first. I've definitely gotten covered in soda water a couple of times. However, if you make sure everything is screwed in tight first, it works great.The only quibble I have is that it seems like I run through the water so quickly, but other than that, I love it."
5,"Sturdy, well made, holds large woodpecker house","I found this pole at my local garden center and found it to be my best birdhouse pole. The metal is heavy gauge and the sections go together easily and fit snugly. I pounded the pointed end into the ground by placing a small piece of wood on top of the section (so I didn't damage the metal) and pounded against that with a sledge hammer. It went right in and it was easy to add the other sections. I have moved it to a different location three times and it's none the worst for wear. I must have better than eight feet still above ground, so it's well above ground. The birdhouse, or feeder, mounted on a flat plate with provided screws. It will be holding the huge red belly woodpecker birdhouse I have mounted on it for a long time. I'm so glad I found it locally after the other reviewer's woes. I highly recommend it."
2,It I wouldn't recomend this product to anyone!,I had bought this headset for my fiacee as a present and he liked the fact that it was light weight and he could hear people just fine but no one could hear him. It sounded like he was driving a motorcyle. It sounded awful! Everytime I talked to him I had to keep asking him what he said at least 3 times. I had to make him change back to his old headset when I would talk to him. We sent it back within 3 days of getting it. If you like for people to hear you when you talk don't buy this product!
1,JUNK!,"This thing has a range of 1 foot, anything more and you get static and noise (or disconnect). The loudest it goes is a whisper. Do not buy this pos."
3,Bluetooth headset,picks up too much noise. Very comfortable to wear but just doesn't seem to have enough volume.
3,monster madness,"The game is alright, I Just wasnt in to it, was hopeing for more of a game like hunter the reckoning. What I got was a game with great ideas but a little short on delivery."
5,Favorite sleeping toy,I got this for my toddler to sleep with at night. She loves it! It's so soft and I love it because there are no plastic parts (like eyes) that I have to worry about her pulling off. A big hit in our house!
5,"Does everything a framing square is supposed to do, and it's blue.","I bought this square mostly based on the light weight rust proof material, for outside work during the monsoon season in the high country of New Mexico. It is very easily handled, and it is square to less than a half degree at 24 inches. The color makes it attractively decorative when not in use, hanging from a screw on the wall of my shop.The light weight makes it feel somewhat flimsy, as though it might be easily bent, but it has been proven very durable in some hard use. I wish they offered it in other colors. I'd buy a very red one and a yellow one too."
1,BAD COMPANY!,THIS ITEM ISN'T EVEN AVAILABLE ANY LONGER AND THEY ARE STILL ADVERTISING IT - AND $10 LESS THAN 2 DAYS AGO!@!!!
4,Beautiful but showing age,This is possibly the last commercial recording of Schubert lied from the great Margaret Price. At age 53- there is some wear and tear of the voice betraying occasional strain especially in the quicker passages and the top notes has a slight flutter even if it is still exceptionally beautiful. The interpretation I find is not as profound than say with Schwarzkopf which is surprising. The selection is exquisite and certainly Graham Johnson delivers classy support. This is a lesser accomplished performance than her disc with hyperion- nonetheless it is an important documentation of her work with Schubert. Recommended.
2,Cheap in More Ways Than One,Standard shipping meant that I had to wait over a week for my item to ship out even though the company is just a state away. So many people had left seller feedback about good fast shipping.The comb arrived looking cheap and bulky with a Made in China sticker. It's too wide and harsh for trying to part hair. Within a week of owning it the varnish began to wear off. I would not buy from this seller again.
5,Worth the wait,"MiG's CD is awesome! The originals are the best and we play them over and over. I really wish there would've been more but the remakes of the other songs are so well done that I like them better than the original versions anyway. Can't wait to hear more from MiG in the future. We fell in love with MiG on ""ROCKSTAR: INXS"" and we're hooked!"
2,Very disappointing for such a talented singer,"I guess I was expecting more. MiG was, in my opinion, the most talented contestant of Rockstar: INXS a couple of years ago... maybe not right for the band, but definitely potential to become an international sensation himself.For his first release, doing nothing but slow ballads was not at all what I had expected. I didn't look at the song list before purchasing, but was very surprised and disappointed when I did read it after the CD arrived.What I loved about MiG during the show was his ability to sing anything... hard rock, slow ballads, classic rock, etc. Limiting himself to the ballads (though his rendition of 'Kiss From A Rose' is still awsome) was, again in my opinion, not a wise choice."
4,fascinating insights into a Christian's stuggle for purity,"Very readible with many insights and practical ""how to's"" for a Christian's pursuit of spiritual growth. Being 500 years old, it also provides an historical background for more contemporary works, the absence of modern psychological jargon is refreshing. This version is theologically grounded in the Latin church and is the most literal translation. The Orthodox version from St. Vladimir's Press probably more suited to Protestant tastes, is loosly translated for content and embellished for a different school of thought, but tends to lose clarity in comparison. I suggest reading both versions concurrently. For Evangelicals, there are points for contention regardless, though neither invalidate the work's relavance for all Christians who strive after moral purity and virtue."
1,do not buy this item,"I was completely ripped off with this item. First of all, don't be stupid like me and pay $18 for shipping. This item is not adequate for a neuro exam. It barely vibrates so I cannot use this item for a neuro physical exam. Overall, I really regret buying this item, I hope nobody else makes this mistake."
3,worked great at first....,"i was happy to received this product and it worked wonderful at first, but now (2-3 months) it only pushes out bubbles on the first 1/2 of the wand, very frustrating... im guessing withing a few week i will need to replace it because that bubbles are becoming very large withing the first CM or 2cm of the bubble wand."
1,Battery Charger,I bought this product hoping that it would be easy to take with me when traveling. It is much larger and heavier than I expected and I find that I don't use it.
4,"Excellent, feature packed combo recorder","This is my first LG product and I'm impressed. The DVD Recorder supports many advanced features such as title split and custom thumnails for +RW discs. Dubbing VHS tapes to disc works flawlessly. Formatting and finalizing is also fast with all disc types.My only complaint is the lack of recording modes. LG only offers 1, 2, 4, and 6 hour recording. The quality difference between 2 and 4 hour recording is dramatic. I wish LG offered a 3 hour mode, like Sony and RCA recorders."
1,Nothing But Problems,"I had nothing but problems with this recorder. It worked fine at first; a little quirky with certain types of discs. Over time, however, it became more and more picky about the discs it would read. Now it won't even recognize your basic single-layer commercially pressed disc--let alone DVDs it recorded itself!"
5,An overwhelmingly inspirational book!,I have read this book over and over again and am still hit with the amazing impact! The words that Chris Fabry has to say are touching and have had an impact on my walk with Christ. His humorous topics are easy to relate to and will touch the depths of your heart and soul. At the Corner of Mundane and Grace is the best book gift I can think of. You will find yourself reading and recommending it to all your friends and family.
5,Danish chocolate may be the best in the world,"Danish chocolate may be the best in the world. I don't know, but this is the best I've tried.So far as I know, Anthon Berg is the only company which found a way to get around the need for a quality-degrading sugar-shell inside the chocolate to hold the ligueur, and this makes a world of difference."
3,On and on and on,"This book has a lot of information! It's filled with soooo many examples to make sure it sticks... or makes you sick. Just a bit too many examples. Tiny little paragraphs of 3-15 examples of the topic in a row and then huge 5 page examples. I could do with less, but I think if they did cut down on the examples this book would be 200 pages shorter but still able to get the point across. As a student, I hate that there is no glossary/definitions easy to find, this makes it very hard to study. Also beware, this book has a few corny lines. Still, I guess overall its ok."
5,Great-looking socks!,"Fast delivery, perfect description, and exactly what I needed for my craft project. And warm! I would recommend this products."
2,WRONG COLOR SENT! Now I have to deal with return.,"Extremely disappointed as I now have to deal with returning an item that was shipped incorrectly. The packing slip clearly lists ""knee high stocking socks with stripes (Black/white;One Size)"" however, they sent the Rainbow colored stripe knee high. And now, with the process of returning the item and then shipping the correct item back to me, my sister will be short one present on Christmas. NOT the end of the world, I know...just kinda' throws a little monkey wrench into my holiday groove. But, like Stella, I will get my groove back. Happy Holidays!"
5,Exceptional,"Maggie's marriage is over, she's lost her job...so she leaves Ireland and heads to LA. A change of scenery might be just the ticket. But this city of constant sunlight and glitz is a true culture shock...unfortunately it's still not enough to make her get over her bad spell.Angels seems to be a bit of a romp at first, but as the story unfolds, Keyes gradually explains Maggie's pain is more than just a failed marriage and losing her job. A deeper, more profound story emerges. Keyes blends humor and depth with flawless ability in this exceptional story of love and loss."
4,A Laugh Out Loud Funny Read,"Marian Keyes is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I loved Last Chance Saloon and I loved Angels just as much.Maggie is the Good Girl of the Walsh Family, her sisters describe her as ""plain yogurt at room temperature."" She seemed to have the perfect life with the perfect husband and perfect job, but that was until she found out that her husband was cheating on her and she left him. She stayed with her parents and two sisters until one day she decided that she needed a change of scenery to help her sort out her feelings and she went to stay with her friend Emily in Los Angeles. Once she arrives there she runs into all sorts of characters from the movie business and proceeds to have a wild time while trying to figure out her life.Angels is a laugh out loud funny book and I was sad to see it end. I look forward to reading more books by Marian Keyes and I highly reccommend reading Angels."
4,Not her best but still enjoyable,"Whilst I am a great fan of Marian Keyes I did not think this book was up to her usual standard. I found myself drifitng off halfway through the story. Her other books have held my attention all the way through. However the wit, humour and quirky writing style was most enjoyable and I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion."
3,Quickie Summer Read,There is not much that this author writes that I'd consider in the least boring but half way through I lost focus on this book so I found myself skipping around. I did the awful thing of reading the end of the book and actually found that I liked the end better than any other bit.
1,boring,I am a fan of Keyes and loved all her other books except this one. Her playing with words to give us an enjoyable book and her clever jokes do not exist in this one. big disappointment.
3,Good but would like longer blades,"I've only used one a tiny bit, but i'd expected there would be some longer blades in the package and I will have to buy some more to meet my needs. I thought this was a mixed package of different lengths...oh well my mistake."
4,Does the job,"These are a decent set of Sawzall blades. If you don't use a Sawzall often, they will do just fine. For heavy duty work though, I recommend the Milwaukee ones..."
4,sawblades,The blades arrived on schedule and in good shape. They work very well and are very sharp. They fit in my saw case in the original packaging
2,In Comparison,"""Breakthrough"" was one of two ""media"" purchases I made to improve my skiing ability. As ""Breakthrough"" is sold in DVD format, it presented itself as an attractive purchase. Unfortunately I did not find the presentation and material particularly helpful.As a result, I then purchased the ""Essentials of Skiing"", a book by Harald Harb and found it fully instructed me on the fundamentals of successful skiing.In conclusion, although the DVD appeared attractive, the essence of improvingmy skiing lay in the pages of Harald Harb's book."
2,A little disappointed,"This sunshade is not top quality and does not look exactly like the picture. It helps but I am not happy that it is not the perfect fit, it sags in the middle."
4,Sheer Nostalgia,"This is a wonderful assortment of children's songs and nursery rhymes my siblings and I grew up on, never thought I would be able to play them for my grandson! Ours were on LP vinyl discs, so I am estatic that I could get them on CD."
1,disappointed,"My son bought this with his birthday money from a ""science"" store. He was very disappointed that it didn't do what he had imagined that it would. WHen his father and I tried it, we also thought that it was fairly ""lame."" He was still going to make the most out of it for pretend play when it broke two days later while I was trying to change the batteries. Yet, my son is intent on trying out all their other ""spy"" products."
3,Good but there is better.,"Supersonic Ear is a good toy, yet there is better. You need to realize that it maximizes all songs not just voices. I Recommend that you buy the spy listener also by Wild Planet.On it you do not have to constantly keep holding down the button (unlike the supersonic ear which you constantely hold).I highly recomend You buy the spy listener instead."
2,It was okay,"This dumb toy is not what I thought it would be, it barely enhances the sound at all and it has a fuzzy ring to it that gets annoying. You cannot hear through walls, doors, or glass. It was not a toy I would recommend to anyone."
4,open up the imagination,"My son (9) asked for this last year for Christmas. It looked a little flimsy, but what the heck. He has used it for things I never would have imagined. Forget spying on people, he listens in on the birds at the bird feeder. He hauled it with to Yellowstone, then stood in the downwind spray of a geyser and got to hear the water roaring out of the hole. All the parents and kids around us kept asking where they could pick one up. The plastic sound collector cone has cracked, but we taped it back together and it still works fine. When we're low on batteries, it looks a lot like a laser gun so he pretends to be in Star Wars with it. In short, much more fun and imagination invoking than I ever thought it would be."
4,Delicious,The shortbread experts are the Scottish but this French version is equally delicious. I can recommend it highly to all cookie lovers.
2,Too much Quantity and not enough Quality,"Scott Mueller's book ""Upgrading and Repairing Laptops"" probably should read ""The History of the Computer and How it Works"". This book is over 800 pages and I quickly got lost in superfluous material dealing with how data is stored on a hard drive to a detailed description on how a video cable is made. What I was hoping for were specs of the top laptop manufacturers with detailed descriptions of removing and repairing, but found only minimal pages on the subject. Scott's solution is to download this information from the manufacturer which leaves me in a quandry why I bought the book. The CD disk I found useful but again deals with only one particular laptop.There is some very useful information in this book but getting it is chore."
2,Disappointment,"The book started out well, with the author's reference to Catholic teaching about Biblical interpretation, but then he loses me: not because I don't understand what he's saying but because he seems more interested in disproving fundamentalist interpretations of the Bible than in giving me a Catholic interpreation of the text of Revelation. Furthermore, after reading that the 144,000 refers to people in heaven (the Book of Revelation itself is referring to the earth--and I reread it to ensure I wasn't missing something) I would add that the author probably needs to be a bit more careful in his own reading of the book itself. After 70 pages, I've decided to return it and pick up an actual commentary from Ignatius Press."
3,How Jesus operates in our lives,A nice spiritual look at the Book of Revelations. Very little detail about what the various odd references really mean. The book is clearly meant to give the reader a chance to reflect on our Lords affect in their personal lives.
4,Very nice for use with a band saw,"I used this with a Delta Bandsaw 28-206.The good: Easy to use and only adds a little extra height to the work surface.The bad: Nothing so farThe silly: The base leaves a gap, which seems silly since the listing specifically says it is for the 28-206. A couple of pieces of wood makes it a nice tight fit."
2,remanufactured?,"I bought this thinking it was a new base, description and price both indicated that it was new but the condition and /or quality doesn't match. One side has a 1.5"" cut or sharp dent. The side with the 3 holes for mounting hardware is bowed and distended so that the plates don't match. Both and all seem to be painted with orignal black so this was shipped purposefully. Perfect for a lower cost reman that I could knowingly beat back into shape, but disappointing for a new product from Amazon"
4,"Not a country music fan, but ...","If you liked the outlaw country music from the seventies (Willie, Waylon), this is one of the pioneers of that genre. I forgot how good it was."
4,My 4-year old godson loves it,"Of course, he loves Snake Eyes in general, but he was just right age for this toy. Large enough to articulate the different positions, and great accessories, I was instantly the coolest godfather around. All plastic, the parts aren't too small and the box turns into a ""locker"" that keeps all of the accessories together."
5,Excellent wire wheel/carbon steel.,"This is excellent ""havy rust removers"" I purchase this Dewalt DW4930 4 inch cable-twist wheel to remove rust. And with 5"" grinder is perfect solution for removing rust from metal."
1,Avoid this Book like the Plague!,"Okay, I've read this novel, and urge you to save yourself some wasted hours. It's idiotic, lame and a total mess. There are occasional moments when it looks like something interesting may happen, then nothing does. It was well written enough to keep me going through it all, but when I reached the end I felt completly gypped.The story has to do with an extremely stupid teenage girl who happens to have a oiuji board that is directly connected to hell. Its a great idea, but doesn't pay off at all. Somehow this stupid girl is able to frustrate the plans of a demon, but the only way that happens is that he's even dumber than she is.Worst of all, there is no cohesive structure to the book, as if it were written in about a week, without any editing or cleanup. It feels like lazy writing to me. It was a waste of time to read it. I hope the author spends a little more energy on their next novel, because this one sucked big time!cb"
5,Tough ball,I have a 5 month old Pitbull and she has yet to destroy it. Great product. If you have a bully breed dog or a dog that keeps destroying toys this is one the will hold up.
4,"a good start, but that's it","First off, it looks like I might have an older edition of this book, so maybe it has been improved. The edition I have is concise, with some errors, and is okay as a reference for beginning students. It's quick and simple to use. But it's nowhere near in-depth enough for advanced students, and even intermediate learners will find it frustrating a fair amount of the time. Use it in conjunction with a variety of other resources."
5,Joss did it again!,I am going to agree with other reviewers that the first couple of episodes were on average bland but fun. Then came episode 6 and I find myself impatiently waiting for the episode to post online on the dollhouse website with FOX on demand. I just finished watching episode 11 and all I can say is wow...didn't see that coming. And now I have to wait a week to find out how the season ends...sigh. I have already preordered my DVD set since the elusive 13th episode is supposed to be on it and because I will probably watch this more than once or twice :) Then it will be a while before we find out the fate of the Dollhouse for next season. It has been worth watching though even if some of the premisis make you feel less than comfortable I find it much more interesting than watching yet another slasher movie. Hopefully you will take the time to watch it and judge for yourself.
4,lots of potential; I wish it had been better,"I probably would not have even given this show a shot if it hadn't been created by Joss Whedon. Now that it's over, I'm glad I did.The series began with too many stand-alone episodes, which are not the strength of this series. The stand-alones are mediocre at best. In fact, I actually tried to give up on the show after a few episodes. Luckily, my wife stayed committed long enough to pull me back when it turned around (I only missed one episode).The plot-oriented episodes are where the show really shines. It's got the intriguing ethical dilemmas that complicate all good sci-fi. And, the twists continually surprised me. Overall, it was good show... with potential to be much better.NOTE: At the time of this review, I have not yet seen the final stand-alone episode that is promised for the DVD release."
5,"Another hit from the creator of ""Buffy""","An interesting idea, being able to program people for different missions. This gives the writers a lot of variety to work with. The part of the story that makes it interesting is the continuing background threads. These provide the framework and character development. I'll be interested to see where this goes in the second season."
1,Ended up fast-forwarding to get to the end of the pilot.,"I was a fan of Buffy, Angel, and Firefly, so I had high hopes for this.Well, we've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women, no chemistry between characters, no endearing characters, and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl. Nothing like delving into a parent's worst nightmare with characters we don't care about. Oh well, that's that."
4,Should have had time to build,Dollhouse was far better than Fox's treatment of the show would have indicated (remember Firefly?). I'm just glad they had a second season to tie up the story line. The quality of the Blu-ray image is superb.
4,I Dig This Show,"I'm a big fan of Buffy TVS and Joss Whedon and it took me a while to get into this show. I watched the first episode when it aired and enjoyed it but wasn't totally hooked. Sometimes it's easier to get into a show when you have the DVD set or watch it on Netflix, which is how I got into Lost. This show was the same way for me. Once I got past the first episode I got hooked. It's definitely a new concept, fun, intriguing and great action and story. It's not quite as good as Buffy but probably on par with Firefly or better. Definitely better than Angel. I really love seeing Amy Acker again and I like the scientest character who also is in Cabin in the Woods, which was also great. If you're a fan of Joss Whedon this is definitely a show to check out."
2,Dissapointing blu ray transfer,After seeing this series in the UK on HD I was dissapointed how poor the transfer to blu ray is compared to its showing on TV.Outside scenes do look good but scenes within the dollhouse and dark scenes look no better then upscaled SD and the overall colour/brightness/contrast appears to be too dull.Was also dissapointed that all extras are not in high definition.This is a good example of a show that looked better on TV than on blu ray
5,Baseball stories,"I spend a lot of time in my car and enjoy baseball so I thought this would keep me entertained and awake during my drive. It started off slow with an explanation of how it came about, but once they got into the stories, I was laughing and remembering some of the best games and stories in baseball. It is really helping me get through the winter and my baseball withdrawals. It has a wide variety of baseball memorabilia - stories and poems and tidbits from spectacular games. If you are a true baseball fan, this is a must have."
5,Wonderful Baseball Stuff,"You do not need to be a die-hard baseball fan to appreciate this collection of truly touching, funny, enlightening stories told well. I will enjoy it over and over!"
3,Just ok,There were certainly some good stories but the live format was distracting. I am not sure I would recommend it as a good listen.
1,Rubbish,"I had already purchased a double DVD of David DeCoteau's; the Brotherhood, and the Brotherhood II.Sisterhood shares similar features. Young nice looking cast, set in a university campus. Young naieve person the target of 'seduction' by evil. That's the good points.The bad points are the 'seductions' are so lame - no one gets down to more than underwear. This happens a lot, but no scene ever really goes anywhere. Such a great chance to be a little bit sexy, but David DeCoteau reals back prudishly... making for very lame sequences.In this, the vampirism is really only evident right at the very end, when the head of the 'sisterhood' bears her fangs just once before dying. Thus it fails on several levels; it's not scary, it's not sexy, it's not really much about vampires.Had I known this film was also by him (my own fault), I'd not have bought it - based on the 'formula' of the other two films mentioned above."
2,Sorority vampires! Oh no!,"Christine (Jennifer Holland) is a new student at Greenway College, and it's sorority rush week, something she has no interest in. Psychology professor Ms Masters (Barbara Crampton) recognizes that Christine has special psychic powers and enlists her help to stop the sisters of the Beta Alpha Tau (BAT) sorority as they corrupt everyone on campus and take their souls.Christine joins BAT and soon learns just how seductive sorority president Devin (Michelle Borth) is. Part of the initiation involves sex with Devin and other sorority sisters. Christine watches and resists at first, but then joins in. It's almost soft core to a beat, but not really, just a lot of lingerie and touching that's not quite in the right places :-)Then we've got an unoriginal plot to stop Devin and the vampires. I kept expecting Ms Masters to rip her tight blouse off to give the film some redeeming erotic quality, but alas, that never happens."
2,Delta GR450 bench grinder,I bought this grinder in summer of 2010 even after reading some of the negative reviews. I wish I had paid attention to the fact that there were so many negative reviews. I have just retired and am seriously getting into wood turning so I need the grinder to sharpen tools for my lathe work. I ignored the shaking for some time but comparing my grinder to the grinder at NWA's headquarters I found that I had to do something about the shake. I have bolted the unit to a cabinet and the shake is still so bad that tools fall out of the cabinet while running the motor. When I place a chisel on the arbor of the unit it makes a burring sound as if the arbor is not quite centered. I am finally going to take it in for repair on Monday. I would not recommend this unit. I will let you know how this repair goes.
2,Too Much Vibration of Plastic Shields,"The grinder seems stable at low, med and high speeds without the eye protective plastic shields. When the shields are installed (A NECESSITY), they vibrate very badly, making a loud noise. The shields are not secured well enough to the grinder. As a result, at high speed the vibrate as much as 1/2 inch or more! This puppy is going back.."
4,Delta GR450 Grinder,"I bought this model for use in sharpening lathe chisels. The larger wheel (8"" vs. 6"") allows for better blade fit across the larger chisel blades. The wheels should eventually be replaced with Norton wheels in the 60 and 120 grit sizes. The biggest problem is that I need a portable grinder and this is too heavy to move easily. I have mounted it on a rolling stand which has helped some. The variable speed is good for sharpening and after the wheels reach speed the grinder is almost vibration free."
3,A good place to start,"As Palmer says this is not a biography or a history of Trinidad. It is a good look at key moments in the long and influential political career of Eric Williams who for better or worse helped shaped the region.I would say that although there is not exactly bias towards the Williams, the book is very focused on his viewpoint and at times neglects the broader implications of world events. To be fair to Palmer he never claims the book is anything else.I felt it was a very accessible read, if sometimes simplistic. It makes a good text for anyone interested in politics outside of the US or in post-colonial nations in particular."
2,Made for Small Children,"Although not terrible, wouldn't recommend buying it.There are better brands out there for the same price.Also, not included in the description, ""Hohner Kids"" is inscribed on the end of the fret board as preferred to ""Hohner."""
3,"Good overview, no good for developers.",Nice overview of protocols and good descriptions of basic concepts. Not useful for application developers.
3,Beware of the phsychology...,"How can the author spit out phsychological assessments on a person he has not personally interviewed? According to his analysis, any young teenage boy who is shy with girls and prefers the company of his ""buddies"" or (""mates"") suffers from some type of sexual ambiguity??!! This seems to describe just about all the teenage boys I know...Better not tell my 14 year old son...Apart from this, the books is an easy read, nothing really new, just take it with a huge grain of salt..."
2,"Horrible graphics, quick to get boring","The screen is SO hard to see, even in 'perfect' lighting. Not only that, it gets boring pretty quickly. It is SO not-random! The game will continually give you 'wrong' numbers so that you can't win (...). Sigh. I had such high hopes for this game. Perhaps the online version is better, but even at the good price here @ Amazon, I don't feel like it was a good 'investment' in my entertainment."
4,A must have for Slingo addicts...,"My husband surprised me with this game for Christmas. I'm an avid Slingo fan so the idea of being able to take it with me wherever I go really appealed to me. It also helps your Slingo cravings when you're waiting to get your turn online! The only disappointments I found were the dim graphics and the absence of cupid! Other than that I think the game is great fun. My niece played it for the first time on the hand held version and she got one of her own soon after. Slingo, in general, is also suitable for kids and kids at heart. Definitely worth buying."
5,"The game is the best, but boy is it hard to see!","This is truly a terrific game, but the graphics are so dim , that it's hard to see and play if the light isn't just right. I wish the manufacturer would have built in the option of lighting the background up."
1,First time Slingo-player,"After reading the glowing reviews that this Slingo game received, I purchased it a short while ago .... and boy was I disappointed! Not only are the graphics poor, but it is very hard to read; I was constantly turning the screen back and forth to see what angle gave the best view, but the contrast was so bad, it just became annoying over time.No real brain strain... I can't see why some would find this educational... you are just making random choices, barely any strategy involved. Stick with Yahtzee or something similar, at least you have to use some math with that one. I didn't find Slingo to be much fun at all and would rather play tic-tac-toe or checkers before resorting to playing Slingo again.I don't know how durable this toy is since I'm not going to play it anymore - but, it didn't fall apart in the short time I had it. Even though this game is probably fun for kids, grown-ups might enjoy Battleship or Yahtzee a lot more."
1,Not as good as I thought it was,"I am a beginner beader on the outlook for an extensive bead book, only to be disappointed with the purchase of this book. There are a few nice jewellery designs, but the rest aren't very inspiring."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I think the only way to enjoy this film is to be as stoned and/or drunk as the people that made it. This is very low budget, very poorly done, and they were practically GIVING this away at FYE a few years ago, so for $2.99, I'm much more apt to take a chance on something than I would at regular price....and now this is selling for $40 on Amazon cuz it's out of print? Oh Lordy....and to think I traded mine in ages ago. Well, at least I have a clear conscience that I'm not going to put this in someone else's hands."
5,butterflies kit,This was great because with a playdate everyone got something to keep them busy while I got a chance to make dinner. When the kids went home they took their proud creations with them that was a good day.
2,Busy mom of four with limited income,"I was pretty disappointed when I open this toy. I have very little money to spend on four wonderful children, and this was to be a Christmas gift, but when I opened it and saw that there were only three littel wooden butterflies, one paint brush and only six primary colors of paint, I really felt like I had wasted my limited resources.I wish I had taken the time to read ALL of the reviews before purchasing this product. At a lower price, like 3.99 or less, this would have been a great deal, well worth it. But not at $14.99 plus shipping. I will certainly be much more careful when choosing toys online that is for sure.Fortunately for me, my children are very well-manored and very compassionate. It is the reason for holiday that makes them happy. NOT the quality or quantity of the gifts they get. God bless them all..."
3,Nice idea but a little disappointed,"I was surprised when I opened this product - a little disappointed. I thought the butterflies would be larger and sturdier. They're not as big as I anticipated and seem like they would break apart pretty easily if they fall from display or accidentally get some pressure applied. My child picked this out and really liked the idea of being able to paint butterflies with your own design. I think it will be really enjoyed for a little while - maybe entertainment for an hour or so. Had I been able to handle the product and compare it with other art project options, I would have passed it by. I believe it is the price that bothers me - a lower price would have made me happier with it."
1,waste of money,Quality wise they are good but small with very limited use and my wife hates that I spent $10 on it.
1,Wrong part sent,Ordered tailgate handle. I recieved a door handle. Want order from these people again. Just because they are not professional enough to no the difference between a door handle and a tailgate handle.
3,worked but not exact fit,The handle works but it does not fit near as well as the original did. However on 10 year old truck it's close enough.
4,Astonishing,"A great book that gives good content of white migration into Africa and the repercussions of it. Unlike other books that discuss this very same issue, The Moon at Noon is brief, constant, and the script is simplistic enough for today's young adults to understand and relate to it. Recommended for those households that want to learn about culture."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased this book looking for insight, but merely found a collection of common practices and ideas. What makes this so disappointing, is the quality of Blattberg's previous works is excellent, I fear that this subject matter has passed him by.Anyone looking for a fresh perspective or actual insight for the marketplace, try Roland Rust."
4,Good family movie...,"I tend to watch a lot of animated type movies with my 5 year old daughter. This was a good movie none the less and it was enjoyable to watch, even as a 28 year old male adult.I would recommend watching without any hesitation."
2,Confused Christmas,Arthur Christmas was surprisingly unpleasant with an uninteresting array of dislikeable characters meandering about a confused Freudian plot. Skip this holiday atrocity and check out Rise of the Guardians.
2,Horrible intro to Santa for kids,"My four year old knows who Santa is, but has never watched a movie about Santa. This was horrible. Some funny parts, but it was mostly dumb humor. The four Santas, with three of them being ""meh"" or aweful, just doesn't set the Christmas tone. Wish that we hadn't bothered."
2,meh,"Not much to say:The graphics were good,But the humor was lowThe story was lameSo just save your dough"
5,Parents enjoyed it more than the kids,"The humor is dry which I like. My kids are 6 and 3 and while they enjoyed it, I'm not sure they were old enough to appreciate it. Here's hoping multiple viewings over the years make it a family classic."
4,Kid friendly,This movie is so cute it is action pacted and teaches the importance of family and the part we all play. Love the move great movie for all ages!
5,A christmas classic,"I haven't written a review on here before, but i just had too for this movie. What else can i say other than this is probably one of the greatest, if not greatest, Christmas movie I've ever seen. Christmas is my favorite time of the year and the holiday has a lot of meaning to me. When watching this I've never felt more Christmas spirit come alive inside of me. It was also the first time I've ever balled my eyes out from watching a movie. I had to wait until everyone left the theater so i could keep some of my manhood intact haha. But anyways if your on the fence about this movie DON'T BE! It's that good! I definately will be watching this every year during the holidays until the day i die"
1,Ultraviolet is a sham! Movie is good though.,"The movie is good and funny.But the ""digital"" copy requires Ultraviolet which means you don't get it in iTunes and to download it you need to watch it only on the Sony App or in a web window on your desktop. You are forced to create an account to view it.I would give the movie a good review but Ultraviolet needs to be stopped before it gets a foothold."
1,Ugghhhhhhh....,"I think it was pretty bad, not a good movie at all....Very slow moving so you kinda lose interest,It was hard to get through it"
1,Ummm - there was a dog having at it on a slipper,What were they thinking? I'm not exaggerating . A elf says to Arthur that the dog likes the slippers more than he does. The dog makes a pity face and Arthur gives him a slipper and he goes at it. What!?
1,turned it off after an hour,"Was really lookin forward to this 3d movie,sat back with the wifey abd started to watch it in 3d,bout an hour in we both looked at each other and said that we where done with this movie,wasnt funny and no real plot,only that santa is a fat waste that doesnt do anything and that arthur was way over goofy and annoying."
1,Don't,Don't know because it expired before we finished. Will rent from a different source so I can actually watch the movie with out it expiring and waisting my money.
4,okay,The movies was different but a little slow. Ended up falling asleep. can's say anymore than what was already said.
4,Great Movie,"I think this is a great movie for the whole family.Will get you in the Christmas Spirit, no matter what age!"
3,Fun for the kids.,"It was fun, but a little slow in parts, but young kids will really like the story and the concept."
4,A Christmas Treat,"I'm a little biased since my daughter worked on this film, but it's a fun telling of the Santa Clause lore. A must add for your Christmas viewing."
5,Great movie for the whole family!,One movie you will watch with your children every Christmas! It's about believing in who you are and loving those who are different then you!
5,Great Christmas movie. Funny and family friendly.,Looking for aChristmas movie and rented Arthur Christmas. It was a great movie. Funny and family friendly. Put it up there with my Christmas Favorites.
4,Good Christmas movie,Good family movie my kids 11 and 6 liked it and adults enjoyed it also. A few funny moments during the movie also
4,Great Christmas Tale,"Wonderful dichotomy of how the Christmas story and modern day technology combine to create a fascinating tale of Christmas around the World. The Everyman, Arthur, wants to ensure the spirit of Santa lives in every child. Great message for kids, amazing special effects, sometimes a little too much, and engaging dialogue. Recommend it for the whole family."
4,Better than average Christmas movie,"Some clever and humorous lines make it an enjoyable movie for adults, not just kids. Would watch again another year."
4,Cute Movie,"My 8 and 12 year old kids loved it. It was unexpected, but very glad we rented it. Enjoy : )"
5,We loved it.,"I was surprised, honestly. I was just looking for a quick Christmas movie we hadn't seen yet. We all enjoyed this one. It was really well done."
4,love it,"Super cute loved it. Not too cheesy, like some cartoon movies. Great lesson taught in this movie with of course a very happy ending a lot of comedy in it too that will have adults laughing also."
5,Marvelous!!!,"I watched this on Christmas day. What a wonderful Christmas movie. It is witty, charming, smart and very clever--a real Christmas present.So great to see such an original and creative story be brought so vibrantly brought to life. Very rare these days.I saw it in 3D and it was really special. A new Christmas classic....James McAvoy and Hugh Laurie lead the stellar cast of voices.Highly recommended."
4,Funny Movie,"We rented this movie and really enjoyed it. My kids liked it, and even I as the parent enjoyed it more than I expected to."
3,Arthur Christmas,It's okay. Our grandchildren will love it. A lot of action for a cartoon. Glad we didn't go to the theater to see it. Waiting for it to come out on DVD was good.
2,Wait and see,"Cut great holes through about 10 inches of ice, till one of the blades broke on about the 4th hole. Sent the auger back and waiting for a replacement. Rating could go up or down depending on how long it takes to get the auger back, and if the blades work properly this time."
1,Missing pages,"This would have been a great book, if the entire section on Holland wasn't missing. The seller was indifferent to my plight and wouldn't stand behind what he sold"
4,Very Impressed!!!,"I am staying at a Residence Inn where I have had the pleasure of using this iron and I believe that I'm sold. I love everything about it including the thermocolors, the steamer, the water capacity and it's also light-weight. After the first use, I wanted to iron everything because it made the job so effortless. It quickly ironed out all of the wrinkles in my linen pants and my husbands jeans. The steamer really helped with the difficult wrinkles. I love it and believe it may be replacing my Rowenta at home. I was surprised at the price of this iron because I assumed that it would be very expensive. I hope that I'm able to find one to purchase. I would highly recommend it."
1,Jacked up,"We call this the jacked-up jack-in-the-box. It's so bad that it's actually funny. The ""music"" is a random series of clicks, my 3 year old can barely turn the handle. Truly terrible. The single worst toy I have ever encountered."
1,Poorly built,"The item does not pop open very well. The handle must be turn in one direct to open it, then turned the other direction to open it again. For small children, it is too confusing to operate. If you turn the handle too much, the music stops and the handle turns without opening the toy. In addition, the sound of the music is of poor quality. I would not recommend this toy at all!"
1,Not satisfied,I was disappointed in the jack in the box. It was smaller than expected and the music was not clear. I would recommend spending more money on a better one.
2,disappointed,"I had looked all over for an old fashioned Jack in the Box. I was excited to find this one on Amazon. However, I was disappointed in this toy. The music is very muffled and sounds out of whack. The ""lock"" mechanism that hold Jack in barely works making it impossible for my 2 year old to do it by himself. I thought this was a toy that could not be poorly done. I was wrong. I would not spend money on this toy again."
1,Lasted Less than one minute befor it broke,I bought this toy for my granddaughters first birthday. My recommendation is don't waste your time. As stated in the previous reviews the music is lame. But the thing broke after only two uses. I took it back and I am looking for something else.
1,Horrible,"This is a horrible excuse for a Jack-In-The-Box. I recommend this toy only if you want to disapoint your child. My son wanted a jack in the box for christmas, He is only three, and this is all he kept asking for. Well when all I could find was this one, I took it. Not realizing how bad it was. The item does not work for anything. You turn the handle, and no music. So you keep turning, and eventually you hear the song, and if you are lucky, it will open. Now that it finally opened, fun trying to close it so the ""fun"" will begin again. We told our son that it was a toy from the Island of Misfit Toys. I am now trying to find a metal toy that actually works."
3,"Good basic book, but . . .","I guess I expected more in the way of creative techniques. It does have some good material, but the price is pretty high for this book, and it was not as helpful as some of the other books in this J-B series."
5,Exquisite purchase,This classic fairytale is vouluptuously illustrated in this version of the 12 wayward princesses that wear out their shoes dancing away the night in secret and the clever persistent man who finally follows them and wins a bride. Th eillustrations really are amazing and win the 5 star rating for this edition.
5,Kids book or not - they don't get to touch it yet!!!,Spectacular artwork!!! And an enjoyable version of a story I haven't read in decades.<
1,Will not prepare you for the CLEP,"Complete waste of money, and I really don't understand the positive feedback I see on Amazon for this book. My daughter used a different book for the CLEP biology and passed it. This time we tried REA for College Algebra and she failed. How could she pass a 6-credit biology test yet fail a 3-credit algebra test, especially when she just finished Algebra 2 with an A grade? It's easy when this book barely covered a third of the material on the exam. There were at least ten questions on the test on graphs, which the book didn't even cover. She did all the practice tests and scored high, so she felt confident about taking the test. This book gave her a false sense of security.If the rest of the REA books are like this, then save your money. Definitely save your money with this worthless book."
2,Not quite what you need for the clep exam,"I studied this book and confidently can say I have learned almost everything it covered. I got a 90% on the practice test so I was confident. However when I took the real one I realized how many problems this book didn't cover. Many graphs and function, almost half of the test is about those. I would say the book helps you about 60% of the test material, but then again that could be many different type. At least thats what happened to my test. I passed with a 65, but just because I had previous knowledge. If you don't this book won't be enough to pass the clep. Hope I helped."
3,Not complete...,"I found the information here helpful but the instructional parts and math review were not very good if you are not comfortable with algebra already. There were some key ideas and concepts that were not covered. I did not feel adequately prepared to take the CLEP after using this book, although I didn't give it very much time to ""sink in"", and ended up taking Algebra over the internet at a local college."
5,Politics and Rhetoric in Corinth is a beginning point for Welborn's discussion of the story of political and social inequality.,"Larry Welborn's Politics and Rhetoric is an important conversation partner with Margaret Mitchell's Rhetoric of Reconciliation and is more tuned to the strife that is caused by political and social inequality. Welborn deals with both First and Second Corinthians and foreshadows his later work on Paul the Fool and on the offender in 2 Cor about which he has written exhaustively in An End to Enmity. One could read An End to Enmity without having read Politics and Rhethoric first, but I don't know why one would want to."
3,A little disappointing,I bought this toy for my 2 year old son for Christmas. He enjoys playing with it however he gets frustrated with the back ramp to the trailer. It is hard to push back under and there is no way for the race cars to stay on the back end without falling off when he drives it around. He does like all the sounds it makes and the little driver is fun for him to play with. But overall I would have to say I was a little dissapointed in it. It wasn't was I was expecting.
1,Terrible cheese,The cheese came in a timely fashion. But it was all covered in some sort of rot and tasted terrible. It no way had the lovely flavor of roquefort cheese. Never again.
4,Putter Golf-PS1,"I enjoy playing this game. It has differt options to play with. It is easy to play an learn, althogh some of the tricks are confusing. It is fun to play especially with the mix course option."
4,Works for me,"I've had a Garmin unit before and thought it was pretty good. This unit blows the garmin out of the water. It has a bit of a learning curve, but it's worth it."
4,Magellan RoadMate 600T gets me there!,"I bought this item a few months ago. For the most part, I am happy with its performance. The directions have been relatively accurate, although on a recent trip to Orlando it directed me to the wrong airport (took me to an executive airport instead of Orlando international). My one big complaint about the product is that you must utilize the car charger in order to charge the battery. It does not come with an indoor power supply chord. However, I purchased one from Magellan's website for about $25. For the amount of money this thing costs, it should have also come with a case. That too I had to purchase separately."
3,Not as advertised,"The content is five star. This order was sold & fulfilled by Amazon as ""buy new"" but it certainly looks as though it was either a re-sale item or a ""used-like new"" item. One corner of the front book cover was damaged and the dustjacket marked with balck crayon (most of which rubbed off), dents and scratches. Won't bother to return it since it's not a gift but Amazon needs to be more accurate in it's description of ""new"" or charge appropriately."
5,Emanuelle Nera,"This is by far the best Emanuelle film out there. If you are a fan of Laura's then you have to watch this film. If you just heard about the film and aren't sure, then just get it, it is worth just seeing Laura Gemser in it."
4,Six years later and I still think it was a good buy!,"No, it's not the best saw available but they are filling a nitch for the occasional craftsman like me. And I'd say that the saws that cost twice as much aren't twice as good. I'm very happy with the results. Just take the extra care to keep it clean and oil the parts for a longer life. The blade that comes with it isn't the best so plan on replacing it before too long."
1,you get what you pay for,made in china - serious junk. the laser is useless and it is flawed in several areas when using. very unhappy with this thing
4,A good saw,"For the price, the GMC sliding miter saw is a good saw. Not hard to adjust and the one I purchased has a lazer that works just fine. I've cut a lot of 1x8 T&G; with no problems whatsoever.It's a big saw, and using it with a miter saw stand makes a big big difference!The blade that comes with the saw is a 24 tooth and will work for rough work, but I suggest you buy a better blade.I rated it a four (4) because the slider bars seem to get dirty fairly easy."
5,Sleeping with a passion!,"When something arouses passion in us, we are sometimes lucky enough to sleep with it. That is exactly what I have done with Jeremiah Comey's ""The Art of Film Acting"". The book rests on my nightstand, and I frequently turn to it for inspiration and knowledge. I have never found a more direct, simple and understandable explanation for this very complicated art known as acting. And if teaching art is so difficult, how does Mr. Comey make it seem so easy? I have a bachelor's degree in acting and more than 30 years in the business. It took me this long to find my ""bible"". This amazing book could also be titled ""The Art of Teaching"". Thank you, Maestro!"
5,"Great Teacher, Great Book","I began working with Jerry a couple months ago to hone my on-camera technique a bit. Before the actual class, I picked up the book and began reading.One of the best investments I've ever made--his book breaks acting down to the smallest detail; and even the most advanced actors can find little gems inside the book.As for me, I began applying his technique during Pilot Season this year...to much success.I still study with him and use the book as a guide. I strongly recommend this book...even if you're not in big markets like LA or New York City or in his class--you'll gain a wealth of knowledge from Chapter 1. I promise!"
4,A Beneficial Text for RF Engineers,"Measuring RF characteristics on die as well as packaged devices requires much attention to detail, from the theoretical to the practical application standpoints. Mr. Wartenberg's book takes into account all of these considerations in this well written book that contains many useful equations as well as practical hands-on tips.This book provides information on RF die and package probing that the entry level as well as experienced RF Design, Test and Product Engineering professional will find useful.Additionally, this text can be used as both a text and a reference book. It provides many references for the reader to investigate topics in even more detail than the extensive writings provided in this book. A must read for anybody who probes and measures die and/or packages containing RF devices."
1,Building Tablet PC Applications,"This book has not been ordered. Several months ago we received this same book when it had not been ordered. We returned the book and no charges were made. Now, I just received an email that the book has been sent again. I don't know what is happening. Please look into this situation. My phone number is 303.666.7011 I would like to straighten this out. Vivien Carter"
5,The Role of Migration,"A topnotch historian examines a very unusual aspect of Eurasian history: the interaction of several types of civilization in the Eurasian Steppe. It is very well written, destined for scholar and layman, and is a wonderful contribution to this complex subject. It is a detailed, expert, and well thought out examination of an often contradictory and hard to untangle history of migrations..."
4,Good but not indestructible,"Medium is good enough for my 38 lbs mix. Strong sturdy toy, but definitely not indestructible as one review/description said. She has a few small tears in it, but nothing life threatening. The vanilla scent is nice, not overwhelming. The football shape bounces all over the place.Good fun, easy to catch, keep an eye on anyone who likes to pick things apart."
2,fun vs. durability,"I have a 35 pound, 11 month old beagle/coonhound mix, who is a pretty strong chewer. It's always a challenge to get him toys that will last and provide fun for him. This rubber ball lasted all but 15 minutes after we gave it to him! Granted, he loved it when we gave it to him, cried when we took it away, and still seems to be searching for the remains of the ball. So, while he loved it, $9+ is a steep rate for 15 minutes. :) Not for strong chewers."
5,My absolute favorite,"This is by far my favorite text on Anatomy and Physiology. Since I was introduced to it in College I have used it time and again in grad school. Saladin has introduced the complexities of A&P in a manner that seems at least, intuitive and memorable. This text brings Anatomy and Physiology together in a way that unifies the body rather than continuously breaking it apart and compartmentalizing. My many thanks to Ken Saladin!"
5,the best Anatomy book ever,"This is the best book I have ever seen for my Anatomy and Physiology class. This book has the best picktures and diagrams, well explained material and websitite is great. I love this book."
2,Damaged Item,"The book arrived in poor condition. Although it was new it had a knocked/torn corner on the cover, and a number of the pages were ripped and bent. I believe this is because of the packaging not adequately protecting the book during transit."
3,Professor's perspective,"Saladin is a pretty good anatomy and physiology text but it contains a number of errors in fact in some areas (e.g., renal), is not well balanced in some areas (e.g., cardiovascular and gastrointestinal) and the pictures are often incorrect (e.g., illustrating epithelial cells as a cube). As a physiologist it appears to me that the physiology is weaker than the anatomy. Many A&P texts contain the same errors, which suggests that these works are not entirely original. I've concluded that I need separate anatomy and physiology texts for my A&P course so that the students will have the benefit of true expertise in each subject area."
3,Be Careful With This Edition,"The first half of the text is excellent; graphics and reader-friendly verbiage are well done. Though I am obligated to say Saladin's treatment of the autonomic system needs extensive supplementation if your future academic program includes a course in Pharamacology.The second half (roughly equating to second semester) is a disaster. I hope the next edition makes the significant repairs needed, especially with endocrine physiology."
5,i finally found it!!!!,"i watched this movie for the first time when i was 11. i used to get scared when the crocodile ate stephanie, but everytime the movie came on, i wanted to watch. my mother used to always ask what my fascination was with this particular movie being that i was afraid of the specific part, but for some reason i couldn't not watch.this movie is awesome. i have been looking for it for years only remembering the eden part of the title. i screamed when i found it, and i can't wait to watch it again and hopefully own it.great movie. you don't even realize how long it is, because it draws you in."
2,I can't believe how bad this album is!,"I saw Tara perform in Seattle and I was really impressed with her show. The next day I ran out and bought her CD and had the surprise of my life: I can't believe how bad this album is! For a woman with such a beautiful voice, she clearly has some producers who have no faith in her. Her vocals are drowned out behind the guitar and drums. It's hard to tell that there is some really well written music hidden in this wretched CD. Don't make the same mistake I did, wait until she puts out a live album."
5,Sparkling,"I first heard Tara on Nettwerk's compilation ""Slowbrew"" (a *great* collection, and a great introduction to a variety of artists). Her song ""Let Her Feel the Rain"" was and is a favorite of mine.""Passenger"" is a lighter, more pop album than ""Silence,"" but it still has Tara's heart, voice, and lyricism at its core. It makes a really good driving-and-singing-along soundtrack.If you get the chance, go see Tara live. I saw her during ""The Girls Room"" free-show tour, and she was wonderful. Even stripped down to guitar, one keyboard, and drums, her songs sparkled."
2,Discos,"Items fly out too fast, and are too small for the dogs to see quickly, so the game not as much fun for them as I would have hoped.Also, the supplies I bought were almost at their sell by date on the date I received them."
1,Made our dog sick.,"We switched to Nutro Lite Dry recently, and it had very negative effects on our Black Lab. The food itself was being digested, but approx 8 hours after eating she would vomit bile. This went on for about a week before we did a search online on reviews of the brand and found a lot of recent reports saying this same Nutro brand was causing other dogs to have the same symptoms. In some cases, people with 3 dogs, saw all 3 dogs start vomiting after changing to Nutro. When all was said and done, I tossed out the remaining Nutro and went back to her previous brand. She has not vomited since. This is obviously not the case with all dogs, but keep in mind you may want to test this brand by purchasing a small bag before purchasing something large. I'm just glad our dog didn't have permanent problems."
2,Same Liza?,"I wasn't at all a Liza fan until I saw her '92 concert from Radio City Music Hall. She totally won me over. Think about it, nine years years ago she was bouncing all over the stage like a young girl, belting out great songs with proper enunciation and pitch.It's hard to believe the Radio City Liza is the same Liza on this CD. This Liza seems very out-of-shape, sings too low, and slurs almost every word. My God, what happened? There are some good songs on the CD, including her rendition of the Trolley song but her voice doesn't meet the challenge of most of the songs. Still, I enjoyed hearing some material which every other broadway diva hasn't already sung to death.But what I really want is Radio City Liza back. Unfortunately, I think that woman is long gone."
3,Not The Comeback We Were Craving,"All the sentimentality and wishes for her recovery aside, this recording varies from quite good to almst embarrassing. At times, Liza seems out of breath, unsure of herself or her formerly perfect way with a song. A for effort, but not much more than a kind B- for results. and speaking of 'Results'--that disc is aging well and deserves a second (or first) look to see what Liza can really do outside of her Carnegie Hall glory days."
4,Nice Drill - When Used Properly,"I have had my 505 for about 3 years now and have not had any problems with mine. Most people don't use hammer drills properly and that's why this one has had a bad rep on Amazon.com. Hammer drills are more for smaller holes in concrete and brick and the occasional large hole. The largest hole I think I have ever drilled with mine is 5/16"" and the drill will drill these all day long. If you want to drill larger holes in masonry,or want a drill that will do whatever you ask of it, get a rotary hammer. They are designed for more abuse and have a larger capacity."
2,Great while it lasts...,"Being one of a dozen Dewalt tools I've owned, this drill is the first to have failed. The motor sparked its last breath today, before venting a wisp of smoke and then going quiet.The motor overheated easily under a load (quite the smell) and was obviously underrated for many of the jobs I used it for. I wouldn't recommend it for drilling holes greater than 1/4"" diameter.Also, the forward/reverse switch broke off during the first week of operation which made changing direction very inconvenient from that point on.Now granted, I mixed thinset w/ this tool and drilled a whole bunch of holes with it. Still, given the quality of most of Dewalt's other tools I expected more. Now I've got to buy another (non-Dewalt) hammer drill."
2,Very dry read and not very insightful,Content is weak and uninteresting. Read the book half way and ditched it to save myself time. Do yourself a favor and save your $.
2,Fun while it lasts.,I got this the day it came out and had completed story mode in a day. After that you can either do multiplayer or go through and redo the stunts in Challenge Mode. Thats where the game lost me. Fun for a day but lost its replay value after that.
4,Nice video game!,"This is a great video game to play. It get's boring fast though. There isn't that much to do in the game, but the first time you play it, you will like it. Once you do everything and do it over and over, it get's pretty boring, but it's still a great video game!"
2,It's Decent.,"My brother wanted this for Christmas. I thought it was sort of goofy and boring, but my brother really seemed to like it. He's 16."
5,informative yet entertaining,A great book for Gun collectors and Cowboy (and Cowgirl) shooters alike.Lots of information on the guns used in the old west presented in an way.
5,"\'dik-she-,ner-e\","a reference book containing words usu. alphabetically arranged along with information about their forms, pronunciations, functions, etymologies, meanings, and syntactical and idiomatic uses."
4,It's a dictionary,The dictionary is small an compact. The writing is legible and the definitions are concise. Definitely recommend for anyone who needs a simple dictionary for their desk.
4,A man's best friend,"The tenth edition is, considering its size and price, very comprehensive. While it doesn't have every word known to mankind, I keep one on me at all times (in the backpack, next to my bed) and use it frequently. So far I haven't really been outright dissapointed, its done much more good than bad as far as clearing up definitions of new and confusing words. Its nice if you need to be moving around frequently as its not cumbersome at all."
5,Everybody Needs a Dictionary,"Right? Not much to say other than it's Merriam-Webster and it's a dictionary but since I have to have a certain number of words, I recommend."
3,Merriam-Webster Dictionary,Got it some time ago an use it all the time. I have spell check on computer of course but this helps with other things to find meanings fast for me. Always a poor speller I depend on this book a lot....an I'm so slow on the computer it takes me twice as long to look it up. Fine for what i needed. Syl from Texas
2,P.O.C.?,"Why are so many people buying an RA175AR (reconditioned).Is it because so many RN175A are bought and returned almost new? Now, why would that be? I thought I had done my homework and was getting a descent deal on a roofing nailer with the Porter Cable. Well, I saw that a large percent of the nails were not struck in the middle, but off center, which bent the head. A blow with my hammer would make the bent head cut the shingle. No hammering meant the head would be cocked up to maybe cut the shingle on top of it. My NR175A is now on it's way to becoming another nice looking RN175AR and I'm on my way to pick up a Bostitch RN46, or a DeWalt D51321, or a Hitachi NV45AB2, or a Makita AN451, or a Max CN450R, or a Senco 455XP, or maybe a Ridgid R175RNA."
4,Came in real handy,Have had these waterbeds for awile and the siphon kit that came with them didn't work well. Once I hooked up the pump I got the water out pretty quick which made it alot easier to start taking the frame down. Great little product I'm sure I will find many more uses down the road.
1,Duplicate discs,"Ordered this 2 disc set twice and both times the set came with duplicate discs.The discs were correctly labeled Disc 1 & Disc 2 but both were actually Disc 2.Ended up returning and cancelled the order entirely, obviously there is a supplier issue that needs to be corrected.My low rating on this CD set is not a reflection on the band (Cheap Trick is 5 star)"
1,bummed,one of the disc has a big scratch and skips songs. it was a gift to my friend so i am not asking for them to send it back.just very disappointed
3,"If you like mozilla, you should like this one","The book is what I expected, but may be a bit less. I thought it would tell me some of the basics about how to put things on the web and then highlight one web development software program and go from there. It got into the web development software faster than I thought and I still had a lot of basic questions about how to put things up on the web. Having said that, however, it did point me in the right direction and I think I feel better about choosing a web development program now than I did before I read this book."
4,Basic abdominal endurance,"I've had this video for a number of years and always return to it. It has a warm-up followed by approximately 12 mins of floor abdominal work using a chair on which to prop your feet, followed by the second half in which no chair is used. All the moves are basic and familiar. No moves are out of the reach of the beginner. The key to this tape is variety, and endurance. Joanie moves without hesitation from one exercise to the next. The workout is almost aerobic in nature. All parts of the abdominal wall are worked. She is constantly queing and giving out tidbits of information. I would recommend this video for any level of exerciser."
5,I am Gabriel,This movie was a refreshing departure from the ordinary.Where so many movies are about the dark side of life.This shows you that if you trust in God even in the most desperate of situations He will see you through.
1,"I was very disappointed in the product, they were not, in fact, Justin boots, but a cheap knock-off made in China","I was very disappointed in the product I received, the quality was atrocious. The leather was of very poor quality, they were un-lined and the soles were composition. These were not, in fact, Justin boots but a cheap knock-off made in China. I feel as if I had been defrauded."
1,Not what I expect from Justin,"I have worn Justin Brand boots for 20+ years and I really thought these were fake when I first put them on. These are stiff, rubber soled, with a very thin insole. My 10 year old Justin boots were comfortable the first time I put them on so I bought 2 pair. My previous Justin boots were the best most comfortable shoes I ever wore so I am very surprised by these.I pay about this much to have a new sole put on my old Justin boots so it seemed like a bargain until I tried them on. My cobbler says he can't replace the soles because they are rubber. He can only replace leather soles. I deleted every clothing item I was considering to buy from my Amazon wish list. I was just so disappointed."
4,Used to clean fossils,"I used this tool to clean limestone rock off of fossils. It is good for that purpose, and doesn't do as much damage to the fossil as an electric engraving tool like dremel. It is slow work and doesn't remove much at a time, so if you are going to do a lot of this kind of thing get an air scribe."
5,Old Time Poetry in Motion,"David Schnaufer, a national dulcimer champion brought the dulcimer to the Nashville scene. Dulcimer means ""sweet sound"" and it's never sounded sweeter than when played by David Schnaufer. Combine that with Bruce Baldassari and you've got a winning combination. Bruce can play the mandolin like no other. I had the opportunity to hear these two together in concert, and I've never heard such a wonderful sound as the dulcimer and mandolin played together by these two masters. This may be heavenly music at it's best. It sure would have the angels singing, clapping, and stomping their feet."
5,great,The blanket came on time. It works great for my 6 months old son. Its soft warm and fits great with room for him 2 grow. I would recommend this product.
2,Not what it appears,"Don't order this item based on the image - it isn't accurate. The cord I got was not coiled, nor did it have an AC (household) plug on one end. Instead I received a straight cord with the sunpak connector on one end and the PC connection on the other. If that's what you want, then you're in luck. Do be aware that some have complained that the sunpak connector will snag in their Sunpak 383 flash because it has an extra groove on the tip. I've not tried it, so I can't say for sure."
5,Full head nails,"The price on this framing nailer is or was the best on the market when I bought it. I was sceptical, however, but I figured I could return it if I wasn't happy. This gun more than exceeded my expectations. It shoots full head nails, has a depth adjustment and has plenty of power for any standard 2X framing I will ever do. I highly recommend."
2,Inconsistent,"I've owned several framing nailers over the years, Senco, Duo-Fast, and Bostitch. While the price of the Porter Cable is attractive, you get what you pay for in this case. I'm running it with the same compressor and hoses as my other guns, but the depth of drive is very inconsistent when shooting 16d nails. Some sink just fine, and others are left protruding by 1/2"" or more. I'm not getting ahead of the compressor, and I've had this happen at a variety of air pressures. If I had it to do over again, I'd go with a Senco or (if you can swallow the extra cost) a Max."
3,Wrong Nailer,"Looked good, until I had to purchase the nails. In New Mexico, one of the hardest items to try and locate is round head nails, especially for the FR350A. Had to return the unit and purchase the FC350A, which I can honestly say is Outstanding. Word of advice... If you are about to get a Nailer, check on th availabilty on the nails first."
3,Pretty good gun working at ground level,"The FR350A is a pretty good gun. I have put thousands of nails through it. Working at ground level, the gun is great. Good balance, easy to hold right or left handed. My complaint is the lack of a rafter hook. When I'm working on the roof, I'm always trying to figure out where and how to put it down with out it falling to the ground. I'm going to add an after-market hook to it. But you'd think PC could build it in with no trouble."
1,not pleased at all,I had ordered a cordless nailer and got a air nailer this is bogus i have order two batery operated units and both of them arrived a air operated...... not good.......on unhappy customer
1,Good track listing. . . . however.........,"Ok, so, yea, it has good track listing, but the problem is, its just that. ONE TRACK! All the songs go right into one another. I suppose if you're having a party, then this would be a great disc to spin, but otherwise, I would avoid it at all costs."
2,Not Worth the Money...,"This game is fairly realistic in most aspects, but focouses way to much on being a good jockey. They make it so no matter how bad of a horse you have, if you ride it the right way you win. It was hard to get used to the first few races but by the 5th race I was winning every race, no matter how bad the horse was. It was really lame. I was only half way through the year and was the #1 jockey and had over $1,000,000 in earnings, which was almost double than the person in second. All in all, very unrealistic. Another thing which I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't own and breed your own horses, thats the funnest part! I was very addicted to Gallop Racer for that very reason, I worked for months breeding and training my horses to make the best horse in the game, it was very enjoyable. G1 Jockey 3 has some nice graphics and is fairly realistic in most aspects, but not in the racing part (which is the most important in my opinion). Hope this helps!"
5,LEFTY the Beanie Baby,I love LEFTY the Beanie Baby!!!! I collect a lot of beanie babies and I have ones I put out for holidays. I ordered LEFTY the Beanie Baby to add to my 4th of July display and it made a great addition! It arrived very quickly and within only a few days after I ordered it from the seller.
5,Excellent product!,I'm a big guy and this cot fits me just fine and could even probably fit another smaller person as well. Very comfortable and comes in handy when you have a large number of guests staying at your place or for when you go camping. I would consider buying a second one if I'm ever in the need.
5,Love the big cot,"This is the first time to review anything, That says a lot about the cot, it was everything I expected with my 38 in mat and XXL sleeping bag.. UPS dropped it off and I set it up in my living room with the custom pad and sleeping bag, sleep like a baby. My wife thought I had lost my mind. Now all I need to do is order the tent that goes with it. A couple days later I did order the Teton 6 tent. The cot is a little to big for the tent, but worked out great for me. Watch the set up and takedown It shows how easy it is to install the ends..."
4,"Great product, hard to assemble","This is a great piece of gear to have when you don't want to loose body heat by laying on the ground. The only issue I have with this bed is that its pretty hard to put together because it uses tension to snap the parts into place. Once you do get it going, its a good bed."
3,not so sturdy,The cot was impressive when opened and placed in the tent. The first hour or so was great until we noticed the cot was tilting a bit. By morning it was noticed to have a collapsing leg. Seems that the weight limit (600 lbs)was incorrect. Adult weighed only 225 pounds. Maybe leg was already crimped...we sent it back and are waiting for response. Everyone else at camp wanted to order one too but now wonder about the guarantee. We'll see.
5,love this cot!!!!,This cot is huge you have room to move and very comfortable I would recommend this cot to anyone looking for a bed it is very tight to set up the first time but it will loosen up a make it easier to set up I love it !!!!!!
1,Yeechch !,"What a disappointment !Hardly any detecting, lots of sick-mind-details of the murderer gloating over the sick details of his lust-murdering.Not AT ALL what you would expect from the writer of the BarnabyseriesDisgusting !"
5,beautiful music,Diana's voice is beautiful. The music is lovely and melodic. You can really hear the soul in her music. Beautiful.
3,A good view for a wet lazy day,"Story line is a bit thin & predictable, Bisset & Bergen do their best to add gusto & crediabilty to their rolls. Good for the glamour lovers."
5,Lime squeezer,I saw chef Rick Bayless used this squeezer on his PBS award winning show Mexico: One plate at a time. If you are into ceviche and fresh salads this is a must have for the latin fare enthusiast. Check out Rick's page for recipes and ideas.[...]
5,Two thumbs up!,"I read this in two days it was so good! You're always on suspense! It had me guessing till the end. Abby Rose is so likable and i you really feel like you can relate to her. Abby has sass, but she has a kind heart aswell.Read it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Video Game Master!!!,"I think this is far beyond all Dynasty Warriors games, and The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.If I picked a game made from Koei,IT WOULD BE THIS ONE!!! It has heros from Shu like, Zhao Yun,Guan Yu,Zhang Fei, and Liu Bei. It has heros from Wu like,Zhou Yu,Sun Ce,Sun Quan,and Sun Jian.It also has heros from Wei like, Xiahou Dun,Xiahou Yuan,Cao Ren,andCao Cao."
2,"Not the worst, but not the best",After reading this book I felt left in the dark. I was very disappointed.
5,Informative,"This book is a suggested by the doctor I work with. Awesome information for people who suffer with, and are seeking to oversome, social anxiety."
1,not what I expected,"The Item arrived right on time, it was a kindle fire buy, speedy, lol. It was not at all what I expected. Thanks, Ds_LD"
3,Premium masonry bits,"These bits are more heavy duty than any I had previously used in a homeowner setting. I was expecting four-flute bits, but these are simply a beefed up version of the typical two-flute bits with a hex shaft which is nice. Though I've only used them for one project, but it appears they will last quite a bit longer than cheaper bits."
5,Rumpole,"Rumpole of the Bailey is excellent. The story telling, and the acting make for many hours of viewing pleasure. The writer (John Mortimer) pulls from his own personal experiences as a British Barrister to bring interesting legal cases to life. Interesting too, is the fact these stories were written and produced over several years; meaning social changes, mores', and fashions are depicted. Rumpole is a disheveled, unconventional character to whom the viewer becomes totally endeared as the series unfolds."
4,Great Set to Have. These won't be around forever perhaps.,I am enjoying the boxed set. The video quality is good. I enjoyed these stories when the first came out and I am enjoying them now. Very English indeed Old Fruit!
4,fine product,"This is my second purchase of this product. I liked the first one so much that I didn't want to try a different phone when I needed a new one. The first one was still working perfectly except that a few buttons on the handset wore out and would not dial without extreme pressure, so I had to dial from the base. Neither repair nor replacement of the handset was available (!!), so I ordered a whole new system at a great price. It arrived quickly and in good condition from the seller but without instructions (which contain a lot of helpful information like the meaning of display codes, etc.). Fortunately, I had kept all instructions from the first one. Bottom line: very good product, very good service from the seller and Amazon.Product: AT&T; E5655 5.8 GHZ Expandable Cordless Digital Phone with Base Speakerphone"
4,Credible Signs of Christ Alive,An eye opening view of life around the world with the catholic Social Justice lens.
2,not actually 4 inches,"I ordered this because i was having difficulty getting a 4 inch thimble locally, saw this online for a good price, and ordered it. After I cut a hole in the wall and put in in however, I found there is a almost 1/2 inch gap around a 4 inch pipe. I measured it and found its 4, 5/8"" inches in diameter. I'm attempting to modify it up to a 5 inch pipe but its more hassle than its worth. otherwise it would be exactly what I needed."
3,I expected more I guess...,"Overall this film is definitely worth watching. That being said I would highly recommend a rental before buying. Acting was good and good Directing but fell short and got lost somewhere along the way. No real Chemistry between Affleck and Hall. Renner's character was ok but one way or another you really don't care either way what happens to these people. I think they only showed ""the crew"" all together once or twice and I could not tell you a single detail about the other Two members of the crew aside from Affleck and Renner. You are not pulling for Affleck OR his nemesis Jon Hamm. I thought the Action was good but they really don't go into the Characters enough. At the end of the Film I was kind of like, ""that's it""? I had heard this often compared to ""HEAT"" with Pacino and Deniro but I personally wouldn't compare the Two Films. As I said worth watching."
2,The Town is Thumbs Down,Was hoping I'd at least be entertained. Ben Afleck really isn't a good actor.The plot is predictable and uninteresting. I think that says it all. Didn't even finishwatching it.
1,used rented movie,Not satisfied with this no cover no original case not told to buyer when this was purchased will not do business again.
2,Boring,Bad acting and just plain boring.Unless you just like Ben Aflack this movie is not very interesting. Don't spend your money.
3,"Has some action, but it was boring.","In spite of the action, the film was somehow boring and without any clear logic, I still do not have clear what was the real importance of the girl who was the first bank's manager."
3,Good,"The premise of this film was good, but overall the story fell short. Well-directed and well-acted, there was no lack of talent behind or in front of the camera. However, I didn't feel like there was any chemistry between them all to show for it. It was as if they were each in their own little movie, not really finding cohesion with each other. Several holes in the plot left huge leaps, or lacks, in logic on MacRay's part, as well as in the overall assumption around the thieves' skills. It's one thing to establish the premise that Charlestown creates the world's most accomplished thieves, but that they carry automatic weapons, leap rooftop to rooftop to escape an entire precinct of cops, etc, is a bit fantastic. In places it can't decide to go for drama or action, all the while trying to be a thriller. All-in-all the film was well shot and keeps your attention, just don't expect more than that."
3,Eh...,It was okay. Kind of predictable. Cheesy at times. Worth watching once. I recomend getting it cheap if you can.
3,COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD IF I HAD NOT SEEN !HEAT! BEFORE,"This movie is a shell of the crime masterpiece known as HEAT,It doesn't make you understand and feel the cut throat,grimy,and cold bloodedness of the streets like HEAT does.The only thing memorible about this movie is the costumes they wore when they robbed banks & armored cars.IF you want to see true crime masterpieces then you need to rent the movie !HEAT! and you also need to see the movie !THIEF! with the actor JAMES CAAN.(In my opinion THIEF is the better movie)"
2,A nice plot with a presumable RAMBO style ending,The plot has a lot of potential but it falls apart by the end. It entertains much less than Spider Man and falls into oblivion soon after it is over. 94% on rotten tomatoes??? Maybe I don't know much about movies... you tell me. :)
4,modern blues from Niederland,"Exellent blues-rock album.If you fan of Oscar Benton(even if not)-you'lllove this cd,specially with blues -ballad""Vitta bella""(!!!)and very poverremake""Cold cold feeling""(of Albert Collins),very impressive 12 minuts blues-rock jam""When i'd rule world"".highly recommended!"
3,eh - french not so good,"I have come to expect a higher caliber of artistry from ms. lott, but in truth, her french on this is quite inconsistent. Her unstressed syllables are often either way too closed or too open, and she inserts very american dipthongs uncontrollably.Her phrasing is also often questionable, as is her frequent use of straight tone. She also tosses of some difficult notes, either learning them incorrectly or just not reaching their exact pitch.That being said, I think it is an admirable collection of the great poulenc's works. It is nice to see such an amount of them in one collection. Buy it for this reason, but for a more satisfying performance of at least the Banalites, try Veronique Gens - it is really stellar!"
1,Boring!,One of the few books I never finished - I almost fell asleep. I like magic and stuff in books; but that was just a little bit of too much of everything.
2,Booooooooooring,"This game is very dumb. All you do is run around and do chores. Then you have to figure out what to do without much instruction. I have finished the game and am not satisfied. The game ends abruptly and you get no reward for winning. To beat the final boss, all you have to do is burn a paper. TOO EASY! This game was boring and I would not recomend it to anyone."
4,Pretty good for 6+,my cousin trey had a huge interest for this game.i played it with my other 4-5 weeks ago he didnt really like it so its a good game and i liked more than Mario
1,Useful Advice and Etiquette; Cheesy wording suggestions,"I thought this book had good advice and tips on thank you note writing, but I found I really couldn't use any of the sample thank you notes. They sound so phony to me - and if someone sent me a thank you note borrowing their language, I would fall off my chair laughing. The book has notes something like: ""we adore the salad bowl you gave us and have filled it with floating candles and put it on the table so we can enjoy it every day!"" I trust that others have found this book useful (mine is the only bad review here so far) but it just misses the mark for me, overall."
5,"Very helpful, highly recommended to any bride.","It was very helpful in sending thank you notes to everyone who attended my wedding. I sent about 300 notes and after a while, I was running out of words to say and beginning to sound insincere. The book prevented those things from happening, and since my husband and I were driving cross-country at the time, the different postal stamps helped the notes be more endearing to the recipients. I highly recommend this book to any bride, especially to the ones who plan to have big weddings."
5,It is so cool,"I had Warship Gunner 2 and it was awesome. I bought this game to see how the first one was. It is very different from the one I had, but still is a nice and entertaining game to play."
3,I dont know about this...,"Let me start by saying I've only used it once. I am African American & I am trying to stretch my relaxers. I only do them once every three months. I bought this with hopes that it'll hold my edges down when my new growth comes in. Well when I used this wax stick it didn't hold like I needed it to. Maybe I didn't use enough or maybe my hair is just too thick or ""nappy"" for this lol. As of now I use Glaze by Elasta QP which works really well but the hold doesn't last long enough for me, especially in the summer months"
5,Plus!,"This item was pretty pricey, but well worth it. I ordered this wonderful series a week before Christmas (along with another DVD that I wrote a review for) and it came two days before the holiday. Although this item is still available at places like RightStuf, it was cheaper here at Amazon, especially when you choose not to pay for speedy shipping. It came in perfect condition, without any marks or dents on the box set; but then again I ordered it new, which is always better than used. Thanks again for the excellent service Amazon!"
2,Returned,"It's a nice watch but HUGE. I couldn't wear it, it was so huge. I ended up returning this watch."
2,"I really wanted to like this, but.....","The fact the the hero used coercion to get the heroine into his bed, has definitely soured this book for me. To me, this is very close to rape, even though, when it came to the act she was willing. He used her fear for her son, knowing that she thought they were lawless raiders, and therefore making a bargain with him, to (as I see it) force her to have sex with with him. JL tends to have her heroes as the very strong VERY silent types, so it wasn't too surprising that we didn't know his feelings, but I was very disappointed to read that his first thoughts of marriage were AFTER their first sexual encounter. I just couldn't like either of them very much. So I found it easy to put the book down, and in fact struggled to finish it. I just didn't care all that much how it worked out for them...."
5,Great Leather Product,Bought this to clean the interior leather of my King Ranch pickup. It does an excellent job of cleaning the leather and preparing it for the additon of the sister product of Leather Conditioner.
4,Great reading,"Life in the far north is so different, and complex, than that of the lower 48. This personal account of daily life depicts one, that at many times is, just a struggle to exist! Anyone interested in reading of those who decided to pursue this wild country life style, will certainly enjoy the vicarious journey."
5,a great new sound,I have heard this band's sound develop over the years. These are dedicated musicians who successfully produce a signature sound. Who is their fine keyboardist? This album should be the first of many!
4,What in Hel's name?,"Wonderful book, beautiful, intelligent writing style. But did no one else notice that the blurb on the back cover/description doesn't match the book... at all? I recommend this trilogy and this book highly, but I recommend you ignore the back cover's description of the plot. It's like someone paid a pig of Hel to read the book and write the blurb."
4,Great Collection of Nina's RCA years!,"Only real downside for this collection is that the liner notes are weak. Very little info. A lot of this stuff is on the Sugar In My Bowl 2 disc collection, which flows better and seems more important. The sound is good for the most part, but you know when Nina's covering the Bee Gees it's not the most essential music. I just wish RCA would release the original albums on disc because there's a great ""live"" album called Black Gold which contains a rewrite of Black is the Color which is one of the most amazing things I've ever heard."
2,bad Filter,"well, i bought this Filter for my Sigma 50-500mm, and it was in bad shape! it seems to be usaed b4,if you are looking for Circular Polarizer, dont buy this oneit is not Good."
2,Waste of money...,"If you have a toddler who loves letters, skip these and go fro the plastic or wooden ones. Ours are lost, chewed up or just plane deteriorated... and this is after only about 3months of use. I have to say my son loves them because he loves letters and numbers, but as a toy, these are a dud... I'm ordering the M&D wooden ones as I write this!"
2,Alright&Fun Fim,"I enjoyed this Film back in the day.DR J. was Really cool in this Film as was Kareem Abdul Jabbar,Meadowlark Lemon,Debbie Allen&some other Cool Folks Round up the Cast.The Soundtrack was tight though."
1,Gordon Wayman,I am a BIG BIG Bee Gees Fan and Robin Gibb is my favorite BG! I love all of his solo albums and give them all a 5 star rating. I was excited to order this Live performance. When I played it I couldn't believe how bad it was. Robin managed to mess up every song! Not one was good. He could have done so much with the Orchestra but he did not. I can't believe they would release such a BAD recording. His voice should have been recoreded at a higher tone. You also can't hear the orchestra like you should. BAD BAD BAD> I played it once and will put it on my shelf. I am too ashame to sell it becuase I don't want to rip anyone else off.I love Robin Gibb and I love his music. I just can't believe he released it. He must have had a bad night. His staff should all be fired because I am sure they told him it was great.Take my advise. Save your money. Give it to charity. Don't buy this CD!
4,haunting,"I think that all Marilyn fans WANT TO KNOW; we want to know how she really felt, thought, lived, and died. The fiction and non-fiction books all portray a much different woman, whether nasty and sexually aggressive or naive and scared (she was all these, I think). This fictional diary by Charles Casillo is fascinating because he got inside her head so well I occasionally forgot I wasn't actually reading Marilyn's thoughts... I felt upon finishing that if we could read her real diary, it would be something like Casillo's verson."
3,A bit disappointed...,"I adore Altan. I'd go see them live ANYtime, as they play with passion, clarity, and originality. This CD, however, doesn't quite do it for me, meaning, I have to make myself listen to it, to keep up with what one of my fave Irish bands is doing. I love the opening cut, and would love to see Altan do more vocally playful stuff like this. I must agree with the Dublin reviewer, however, about the middle-of-the-road quality of the album overall. I miss the rich,driving arrangements typical of their studio work (the sets here sound a little thin to me), and think there are too many slow ballads. (Of these, I do find ""Island Girl"" very moving, as it does seem to allude to Frankie. But I'd only include one of these per album.) I've always bought Altan albums on principle, without previewing, knowing I was in for a great listen. I will probably sample first, here on out."
2,dublin traditionalist,"As usual, Altan show great virtuosity, but it is a pity to see them becoming more and more generic and MOR. Pity also to see Maire Ni Mhaonaigh singing more and more in English. Beidh Aonach Amarach is good, though."
4,masterful,"Derek Trucks is a superb guitarist, although probably not the most animated musician you'll ever see. I really liked the variety of this band's music. Video & audio quality are good. I'd love to see Derek and wife Susan (Tedeschi) in a joint effort (other than in Clapton's ""Crossroads""). Worth adding to your video collection."
3,"realistic, but not perfect","I bought this game becuase my local bestbuy has it featured in a poster, and I thought it would be a good choice for on-line play. Honestly, I think this game is realistic enough, and the graphics are such that if you viewed it from a distance from your tv, it looks like a top-notch war-movie. A good feature of this game is that it let take up your rifle and aim down the sight, and release it as you lift the trigger, this provides much action and realism.too few checkpoints, granades hit you too easily, damage effect very annoying, otherwise, ok game."
2,wait for the new one on 360,"if they had just copied the PC-version and put in on the Xbox, i would have given it 4 stars. the sound is supposed to be great on this game, i only thought it was loud. i would rather have a quieter game with more detailed sound than just a loud obnoxious game. just making the game loud doesn't make it realistic. as a result, i found myself feeling detached from the game and sold it after 2 days. i guess i will wait and see what the next version is like on the Xbox 360."
4,"A good game, with some flaws.","I want to start off saying that this is a fun game, full of action and lots of fun. The graphics could improve, but, non-the-less, the battle scenes are relatively realistic, and the game is challenging.Aspects of this game need serious work, the Russian tank for instance has awful controls! There are some times when you can't figure out what to do, and that can be a little annoying. There is a ton of action and a lot of different stuff to do. You alternate between being Russian, British, and American.The reason I rated this four stars, not five, is because I started to compare it to Halo, so I took off a star. This is a fun game, but it's not like Halo 2!!"
5,"unbileveable, you will die when you play it . oh yeah ride the horse baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","this games is great. theres a few gliches in this game but its still realy fun to play. some of the other writers say its a bad game, its not. they just dont want you to have fun, thats what there trying to do to you. just play this game and you will be hooked forever. you will never want to give this game up!good things: great a.i, good grafics, great levels, fun to play, and its great to play different characters after every mission.Oh also you will love playing the russans, the british, and the americansbad things:nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooothing great game"
5,This CD is everything I expected and More!,"I have just about every one of Selena's CD's and I can honestly say this is one of the best. I have enjoyed listening to it. Her Voice is not only Beautiful, it is very powerful, and the combination of the 2 makes her voice unlike any others I have listend to. I strongly suggest to ANYONE to buy this CD you will not regret it TRUST ME!"
3,I give this book a C-.,"This book is just a guide to Simpsons merchandise and since it is from 1990, it's outdated. No good unless you like to collect Simpsons merchandise then you may like it."
2,Perfect anti-deer product,"It is question of smell, it does not smell too good. We use it to deter deer to come to the yard: just a whiff of it on a T-shirt you leave in the wind: it is very efficient. On a person, it does not work. I dearly hope Baryshnikov does not use it himself."
2,Could have been great but died after less than 3 months,"I purchased this last August 29, 2006. Received it Sept. 16. Last used it on Dec. 6, 2006. Tried to use it on Dec. 17 but it's completely dead. I tried 3 computers (all were able to detect other USB drives/devices) and in all instances, the computers were not able to detect this USB drive. There was just a cyclical clicking noise coming from inside.This product could have been great. It's a Samsung Pleomax but the hard drive inside is a Seagate. I don't know if this is how it is for all Samsung Pleomax UHD-6G or if I was just unlucky to get the one that's defective."
5,reishi,"pronounced ""ree-she""my friend told me about this amazing mushroom. I don't know what is in it but I get an energy boost when I take it (along with my cocktail of vitamins). I'll report back if something interesting happens (good or bad)"
1,Looks can be deceiving,"This is an awesome looking piece.. but after a month, the finish started to come off... It ended up being a pretty piece of trash.Maybe I got a bad seed, but I wouldn't recommend this."
2,another disappointment,"This book is like so many others of Gordon Lightfoots music, no guitar tabs!, For someone's whose music is almost entirely guitar oriented there is a dearth of sheet music featuring tab."
2,"easy, but very poor reception","My mother-in-law came to visit for a month and brought her computer with her. I wanted an easy way to connect her desktop computer to our wireless access point (also linksys). This product is very easy to install (USB), but must have a terrible antenna, because it has a hard time picking up the signal even when only ~20 feet away. We have two laptops that connect at high speed anywhere in the house -- compared to those, this adapter is very disappointing. That said, as long as it is installed very close to the access point, it works fine."
5,"Dont worry, this is awsome","ok, this game is AWSOMEsure, it has the same formula and bla bla blabut its a great gamepeople say the graphics are ok, but once you play it you will think ruby, saphire, fire red, leaf green and emerald are all badyou will never go back to those versionsthe graphics to me are amazing, they mixed a 2d world with a 3d world.when you walk into town all the buildings pop out of the screen,the windmill place is one of the best examples.then they included a other regoin that is supposed to be under sinnoh(the region you are in) called the undergroundthis is where you get your secret base and evolution stons and fossils, ect....it is a lot better then prevous gamesit has a good replay so if you get bored(i dont see how)you could start overthis game is just AWSOME"
4,Pokemon Pearl: Awesome :),"this game is great, because there are more things to do than the other games. So far my favorite thing to do is go under ground and search for stuff, and set traps for other people. And Wi-Fi connection for the game is cool cause you can battle people all over the world, and trade for pokemon you don't have. I give it two thumbs up! b^-^d"
4,A Nice Game,"This game is pretty fun. When I first got it, i was really in to it. After a while, it became pretty boring and i didn't want to play it anymore. I didn't know what to do next, what to catch, and where to go, etc... I wanted to end the game already but i didn't know wat to do!I think that it would be a pretty fun game for people who like to explore and have a loootttt of patience. Overall, the game is something worth its cost."
3,Met our needs,Nice costume. Our son was happy with it and it fit him thanks to straps in the back and velcro throughout.
1,Arrived broken. Was very unstable when we finally did put it together. Big bulky and ugly. Terrible.,I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. We bought it as a gift and the order was a nightmare. It arrived broken and when we did put it together it was very unstable. Ended up just putting it on the street for someone to take. No one took it.
4,Very pretty,"My daughters think this is pretty ""over-the- top"", and I kind of agree, but it is pretty and is kind of a conversation piece. It's one of those things that people view as ""if you can't say something nice, don't say anything""."
3,Nice Lamp,Nice lamp but the crystals (Plastic) look very cheap. For this price you can't really expect more. I replaced the plastic crystals with some vintage real Austrian Crystals that were my mother's. It looks amazing now.
5,I love this bookbag,The bookbag by Teton Sports is my favorite. I ordered a red one and I can't believe all the room it has in it. I like the special pockets to hold my phone and the headphone slot to bring the headphones through while keeping your electonics secure. I highly recommend this bookbag especially for high school and college students. Also great for camping with all the room it has in it.
2,I was not impressed except for Shoulder Suspension.,"This may be useful for school kids. Probably not recommended for Laptop. Not well designed for office use. For Gym or camp or vacation might be OK. Also the separating walls between compartment are thin nylon clothlike. Probably if you spill in one compartment very easy to sip through other compartment. Also the Main compartment Zipper comes all the way down till bottom. So compartment strength depends on how good are Zippers. The shape narrows at the top. So if you want to carry document they will fold at the top. No water bottle compartment. Probably I will check out Swiss Gear Backpacks. I won't say this is 5 star. Not for office going adults. But looking at price may be worth buy. Shoulder suspension elastic is good. If that is available in swiss gear, go for Swiss Gear backpacks. Like Maxxum or Rival."
3,Book Bag for School,My son needed a new backpack for the upcoming school year. I looked around and finally decided on this one. My son looked at the picture after I showed it to him and he decided that he wanted this one.
5,Great bookbag!,"I love this backpack. I carry almost twice as much in it as my last backpack, but it doesn't hurt my back or rub into my shoulders. I am a college student with a big, heavy laptop and it fits very easily. I don't have a lot of textbooks, most of my schoolbooks are smaller or novels, so I can't vouch for the backpack on that end. The pockets are spacious, and the bag looks nice too. I had never heard of the Teton brand, and I was a little skeptical, especially because it was half the price of some other full-size backpacks, but I am really impressed with the quality. The only thing I don't like are the straps on the side - I think they are supposed to do something, but I don't know what. That's just my preference, though. The top handle-thingy is reinforced, which is great. Very nice backpack, does everything I need it to and more. I would recommend it to anyone, probably high school and up because it is a larger back pack and is definitely too big for elementary school."
2,Terrible design and quality,"Very disappointed.The plastic handle on top started breaking after a couple of months. The straps on the side are very inconveniently situated: it is hard to move the zipper past them.. The main straps are falling apart. I mean, it's just such a bad quality. Don't waste money."
4,Great Product,"As a joke, I call this my ""man purse."" I use this thing every single day, and I'm not gentle with it. I carry a varying amount of stuff, and have used it on one shoulder and on my back. Had no problems getting it comfortable in either location.There are enough pockets for me to carry what I need. It swallowed a notebook no problem with plenty of room, so it's a nice size for students who would end up carrying more. The interior pockets in the ""second"" big pocket hold a variety of things nicely, and the little hole for headphone wires is convenient.I like the pocket on the strap, too. I keep my cell phone there, and it's big enough to keep it snug without worrying about it popping out. Whenever this pack ends up giving up, I'll definitely be looking into buying another."
5,Fantastic Tongs for the Professional Kitchen!,"I realize these tongs were designed with the home cook in mind (the cute rubber grips on the handles) but, these are the best tongs for the restaurant I've come across. They're beefy enough to stand up to commercial kitchen abuse and laugh it off. In fact, they're heavier than anything I've found in the restaurant supply stores. In the kitchen we use tongs as hands, pulling plates and pans. These tongs are so solid they can grip a stack of hot saute pans, or stack of heated bowls with confidence. The jaws have a nice wide grip, and the width of the handles prevents the tongs from ""rolling"" in the hand like most tongs when you have a heavy load.Anyone doing saute in a commercial kitchen needs to check these out. I ripped the cute rubber grips off for sanitation reasons but, these are excellent tongs. (Just leave them unattended at your station and see how quickly the cook next to you asks you where you got them.)"
4,Create and Educate,"I purchased two of these for my grandsons while they visited. One is 8 and the other is almost 4. The younger one needed more help, but the older one had a wonderful time creating with the backdrop. I had him assemble it onto a foam core board, made some paper mache out of toilet paper and glue and put that down for rocks and ground. He made a sky with some clouds out of the paper mache and painted the entire thing. It looks great. I read the pamphlet to him about dinosaurs while he was creating his background, so he learned while he was doing the project. He took it to school to show it after going back home. Great fun! I rated it four stars only for the durability, but that should be understood because of the mold concept."
5,Good price,"large batch of nice quality, no-smell/no-taste gelatine capsulesI had a few capsules of different size ""hiding"" in the batch but those were not too many"
5,worked well,"was on a diet where I needed to consume a 1/2 tsp of sea salt with my meals a day and I can't stand the taste of too much salt, so bought these to load them up with salt to get it down. Worked really well!"
5,Great project,I purchased this for my daughter when she was in the second grade and she had to do a dinosaur project. She used this TRex as her visual. She had a lot of fun making the bones and painting them! The finished product looked great and she got so many compliments from the kids in her class! I would recommend purchasing this.
1,Won't buy this book,"Although I love to do cryptogram puzzles, I won't be buying this or any other book of puzzles with a toilet seat on the cover. For this puzzle-doer, an instant turn-off. Sorry!"
4,Good movie,This movie worked out very well at keeping my 3 year old occupied. He loves Thomas the Train and this has a good amount of movie time and interesting stories. Very nice movie.
5,A WINNER,GREAT DEAL..2 DVDS WITH TONS OF CLASSIC STORIES..GREAT PRICE AND WE WATCH THIS ONE A LOT 20 STORIES TOTAL!keeps my 3 year old entertained
5,WONDERFUL,"I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH. I LIVE 3000 MILES AWAY FROM MY LITTLE GRANDSON AND HE JUST LAUGHED WITH DELIGHT WHEN HE RECEIVED HIS ""THOMAS AND FRIENDS."" THANK YOU AGAIN"
5,New Orleans Jazz,On this DVD you are catching the best of the New Orleans jazz culture up front in all its earthiness from Doc John to Allen Touisant .Simply a true joy to hear almost all the great aspects of New Orleans jazz stll cooking now .If you dig earthy New Orleans jazz you will cherish this DVD .
5,Dewalt Products,Dewalt is a very very good company manufacturing high quality products and the only brand I buy. I give this product 5 stars because I highly rercommend Dewalt products.
5,great tool,"Excelent for hardwork, combined with the Dewalt d25023makes hardwoork easy and fast.very good toolrecomended for home use and hardwork"
5,"Clear, convincing, good",THis books presents clear and convincing evidence about the Watergate break-in. The analysis is first-rate and the author does an excellent job of showing the whos and whys behind Watergate. Read this if you only read one book.
4,Awesome,"This track is awesome! It has very good sound to it and was written beautifully. Good job, Damon Zick!"
1,Hard-to-prepare mystery mounds,"Prepping for the assault on Mount Robson in Robson River Campground, we opted to give Alpine Aire's Mashed Potatoes and Country Gravy with Turkey a try. Oops--we don't pack a pot large enough for the 3.25 cups of boiled H2O. We found an O2 absorber and a country gravy packet inside. The directions didn't address the gravy packet. So we boiled 2 cups and mixed 'em with gravy and then into the main package while boiling another 1.25 cups. The water mixed poorly. We waited 8 minutes after each addition of hot water and still the moderately chunky turkey wasn't fully rehydrated, although the bits had a turkey flavor. The overall result was poor quality instant potatoes that were too runny and flavorless even with added salt and pepper. Perhaps space smuggler Blando Calrissian was forced to eat this in some dark spinoff Star Wars novel, but we threw half away and ate crackers instead."
1,Misleading advertising.,"Wanted to wipe data securely only, but not programs or operating systems. Perhaps this product doesn't exist, and this program and its companion Media Wiper are not selective. Why not just reformat the disk? Will return the product."
2,Museum Guide,"If you are visiting Paris to go to museums, this is the book for you... otherwise, look elsewhere. There is very little information for travelers who just like to explore this wonderful city, i.e. neighborhood flavors, interesting shopping areas, and great restaurants."
2,NONE of these come with F25. All sizes come with F11 adapter.,"The bag is great, but all of the sizes state in the title that they come with the F25 Fixer, which works with almost all bikes. The F11 Fixer does NOT!"
2,"Old recordings, not great to be honest!","This album is pretty much a bootleg quality compilation of very old Billy Joel songs - some from his first album, Cold Spring Harbour, and the rest from his earlier days with bands like The Hassles and Attila.The recordings seem to be fuzzy, distorted and run a little slow. Many of them sound so weird that I was wondering if it WAS Billy at all! Anyway, the earliest songs are, by Billy's admission himself, not great musical pieces.Unless you're a rabidly curious Billy Joel fan, it's probably best to avoid this one, and stick to the original albums."
3,"A useful introduction, but far too many errors and far too expensive","I wanted to like this book. It was recommended to me by a colleague, and it presents exactly the kind of introduction to statistics that I needed. But there are too many errors (mathematical, typographical, take your pick) within the sample problems presented -- and for a readership of introductory-level students, the number of errors needs to be ZERO.The price is also unconscionable for a small paperback book less than 200 pages in length. This is not Amazon's fault, and in fact they bring the price down a bit from the even-more-outrageous price set by the publisher. But pricing such a book at more than $60 is indefensible, and is nothing more than a shakedown for the average student. If I did not have a generous manager willing to foot the bill for this expense as a professional training tool (for which the book is well suited), there is no way I would have purchased this book, even at Amazon's discounted price."
2,Just Two Stars No More,"This book is averagely written in an explanatory context (given that the author is definitely a mathematician and not and English graduate (typos, spellings etc)). I have found it useful in grasping the basics of statistics.However as a member of the statistically terrified population I was appalled that so many mistakes existed in the exercises. Really unfair when you are unsure your answer is correct or not, i.e. a student of the book!!!!!The Author should be afraid, I am now 'less' afraid of statistics, however terrified of all statisticians' attempts at literature!Overall not worth the money to buy, maybe borrow from a library at best!(Postgraduate Researcher, PhD Pending)"
2,Proof-reading no longer a MUST?,Interesting name and contents of a book can in no way lessen the authors' duty on proof-reading. A book with many errors and typos should never be published in the first place. These two authors spit out this book to the marketplace similar to what Microsoft does with its software. This is sad and annoying.
1,Sword Indentity,"Not much action, the fight scenes were boring. Bad Movie! I don't have anything good to say about it, it was one of the worst movies I have seen."
4,Good for the price,"it's not the greatest quality picture, but i moved my computer to a more central location and needed a flat monitor in order to push the desk against the wall (normal monitor was way too deep). was a cheap price so i didn't expect dazzling quality and unmatched clarity but it fits my needs and i'm happy with it!"
1,the bundle was not as advertised,"I ordered the motivational book and video, and was sent the right book and some stupid documentary about fish."
5,Best doll for girls and boys,"My doughter loves Bratz dolls. She got this doll from her grandma for christmas (2003) and she won't stop playing with it. She even takes it to school. In fact she told me to bye her the run way for her for her birthday, os I got it for her and she LOVES IT TO DETH IT DRIVES ME CRAZY to see her whiel her dad puys it all away so shell get her mind off she will cry and cry for hours after hours. I cant stand it becuse she love it so much."
2,"Sturdy can, pathetic spout.",I stole that title review from another reviewer because it is spot on. I dismissed some of the reviews when I bought this and I regret that decision.
3,good but flawed,"I bought two of these containers back in july and mine have a different style filling nozzle; one with a safety switch and a handle you push down. I found if you tip the unit and then push the handle, the nozzle drips. They also leak from around the vent when tipped side to side during filling. Additionally, the catch that locks the filler nozzle to the can has begun to wear down after months of use, and the teeth don't really hold it in place any longer. Not bad for the price, but I will look elsewhere for future gas/diesel cans."
3,Origin of the Agates.,"A book far ahead in his time in explaning how the agates in his homeland, former Eastern-Germany, were formed and in particular East-German thundereggs from St. Egidien. The book contains some great pictures. Nowadays the origin of the agates are discussed and several theories excists, but Blankenburg was the first writer who dared to take the first step in what he believed was the right theorie."
5,excelente compra,"una increible opcion para los seguidores de las novelas de Agatha Christie las actuaciones sobre todo la de Margaret Rutherford genial ,la entrega antes del periodo establecido solo les pediria que existieran mas opciones con subtitulos en español de series basadas en las novelas de esta increible escritora."
5,"Sexy, dangerous, unforgettable....","When Anne Stuart has a new book out, I RUN to get it, the same way the last generation of readers ran to buy books by Mary Stewart, Victoria Holt or Phyllis Whitney.But Stuart brings her own unique, contemporary, sharp edge to her thrilling romantic suspense novels and this one is no exception. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be swept away by unforgettable characters, a twisty plot and a tale brilliantly told."
2,Lord...,"The writing style in this book was so tedious to read, i had to give up 4 chapters in. If you like reading random thoughts jotted down all ou of order, this is the book for you..."
3,I love this toy!!,I love bratz!! Especially when there going to the mall and they are soooooooooooo fun to play with !! If you buy this you will now what I mean!!
1,YOU CALL THIS A BRAT?,"Dana is the worst! She replaced Meygan!I AM MEYGAN""S NUMBER ONE FAN. This Dana is SOOOOOOOOo ugly. Her hair makes her look like a pineapple we brought her befor we knew she replaceed meygan when Ifound i was so mad I cutoff all her hair,scribbled over her with purple lipstik andbroke her leg off.DO NOT buy it your child will be so dissapointed with this pineapple-headed dollMeygan's number 1 fanDana's number 1 hater"
2,THE BEST!,This has to be the best Dana evermade! Dana and Meygan are the ones with style! Everyone loves Meygan so i think they should put her in all the collections Dana is in.hope this review was helplful
3,It helped me understand my rights in court better.,"""Gideon's Trumpet"" was a movie that helped me understand more about my rights in court and the term of double jepordy. Clarence Earl Gideon was arrested for breaking and entering into a pool a few blocks from his home. There was a witness that testified against him and stated that he saw Gideon walk out of the pool room with a pocket full of change and a jug of liquor. Being that when Gideon asked for a lawyer and was not appointed one, he lost the trial. Gideon was sentenced to five years in prision. He new that this was not a fair trial. He did research and found that he had the right to be appointed a lawyer. He wrote to the supreme court and was re-trailed. He won the case. Gideon fought back and won. This movie was very interesting and educational to me at the same time. It could have had some improvements, but it was good."
3,strange little spoon,Much shorter handle length than expected but a nice broad scoop. Strange little spoon
2,Yucko.,"If you enjoy this sort of florid, over-ripe, overproduced pop, then I suppose this is a very generous collection, what with the rarities and live tracks and all. It's not for me, though. I do not like it, Sam I Am. There are other Youssou N'Dour albums I'd recommend first."
4,The Great International,The book was wonderful. I thought it showed everything in great detail. When I look at it I can find everything right away.
4,BRATZ ARE THE COOLEST!!,"For all the mother's who think Bratz aren't for little girls, well, here's my oponion. I would rather have my 8 yr. old girl play with her Bratz dolls than watch Britney Spears videos. Get over it Party Pooper Mom's."
5,Bratz Formal Funk Jade,"I got Jade for Easter. She comes wearing an orange dress, orange shoes, a silver crown, a silver necklace, white gloves, a purse, and a silver bracelet. Her other outfit is a purple dress and another pair of shoes. Her other accessories are a purse, 4 bracelets, a crown, two pairs of earrings, and 2 hairclips. She can go on the runway really good (better than Nevra!)!"
3,S.T.'s opinion review,"i think this toy is a cool bratz doll and it would be fun to use if you are playing prom day or a dance or a ball or something with your bratz dollz and your friends bratz dolls.it might not be that durable considering if u have a dog that may rip the dress flaires.thats all for my review.over all 3 stars , WELL DONE""ok"". signed,ST KID."
3,Arguement,"J. W. C. Pennington put forth a lot of arguement in this book. A lot of it I agree to, but most of it I will have to do further research to make a final conclusion."
2,Metal vs. Balsa wood maybe??????????,"I DO NOT THINK THE RADIO FLYER TOWN AND COUNTRY RED WAGON IS A SUBSTANCIAL WAGON. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO PAY FOR A METAL WAGON THAT WOULD REALLY LAST THAN THE TOWN AND COUNTRY MODEL WITH SLATS LIKE TOOTHPICKS. tHIS WAS PURCHASED FOR A 3 YR. OLD BOY. SAFETY SHOULD BE PRIMARY, NOT THE COST. tHE LONGER WE LIVE THE MORE WE MUST REALIZE THE CHILDREN MUST COME FIRST, NOT THE DOLLAR."
3,Side boards,I was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side-boards which is very dangerous for kids. I was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson's wagon which I purchased for his 2nd birthday. He is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off.
4,Build it and fun will come,"Putting the wagon together took minimal amount of time (15-20 minutes) and our grandson loves to ride in it...either inside or outside. Great for trips to a park, the zoo, or just around the neighborhood; it's both durable and a great looking red wagon!"
1,Book,Not worth ordering in my opinion--I gave it away as soon as I looked through it . What a disappointing purchase
5,Refreshing Read,"What a pleasant surprise this book was. The characters are first rate, likable, interesting and just enough off beat. The story was interesting with a mystery that had a surprising conclusion. A great mix of sleuthing with an intimate look at Victorian London. And just the right amount of devilish humor. I can't wait to read the next one."
2,A Little Bad Language for your Child to Absorb,"I was delighted by the stop-motion animation, the charming tale, and the lively songs, when all of a sudden I, turning to my wife, said, ""Did that just say what I think it said?"" It had, just a bit of profane language, my 2-year-old daughter absorbing all that was on the screen. Disappointment had barely set in when something a little worse was said, this time by Badger. Such things exclude my family from viewing what would have otherwise been a pleasant treat.If you love your children, then you will want better for them."
4,Good family entertainment...,"My Son who is 4 just LOVES these series of ""The Wind in the Willows""... We have them all..."
5,The first and definitely one of the best books on the Compact Framework,"As the first Compact Framework book on the market, it helped light the way for all that followed. As a mobile developer, this book has helped me tremendously and I refer to it all the time. This book belongs in the collection of anyone who has to tackle the nuances of embedded development on the Windows Mobile platform."
4,A good Introduction for beginner but not too deep...,"I bought this book from Amazon once it's just published. Perhaps i have a high expectation on it, the book dissapointed me a bit.Though the book did covers most of the topics on mobile application development, but it goes too shallow and not much of sample codes. Some of the important topics are just covered briefly and zero sample codes for it.But well, I recemmend this book if you want to have an understanding of .NCF and a quick start. It's a good book!"
4,Best of the best,"This is definatley the most comprhencive and infomative book about pocket pc out there.Buy this book first, you will not regret it."
4,toy a boy has to have,This is a toy every young boy needs. Radio Flyer toys last and last. This wagon will be in the family for many years.
5,Perfect gift!,"I ordered this gift for our granson's birthday. His dad had mentioned trying to find a wagon just like the one he had growing up, but all he could find were plastic wagons. The gift really ended up being a gift for our son and grandson!! It was perfect!!"
5,"Great cart, arrived with dents","My son (4 yrs old) cannot leave this alone. We use it mostly to get the mail, walk to the pool, in fact anywhere we go he's either in it, or puling it full of toys, etc. It is strong, sturdy and easily put together. Arrived on time, but when unpacked it has two dents to the top of the rim. Thing is, it's not like you can pop back over to the Wal Mart and swap it when you've bought it online - once you've unpacked it and your kids have seen it you cannot explain to them they have to wait another week or two in the hope we get another one that has fewer dents. So I keep my dented one. I would buy elsewhere next time for this reason - it is a heavy item with less than adequate packaging and so you need to check it before leaving the store."
5,The Classic,"The Classic Little Red Wagon (Received as a gift ordered from Amazon)PROS:-Sturdy heavy duty materials (Quality tires, bin, handle)-Classic style and brand-Smooth riding wheelsCONS:-Did arrive with a few dents and dings, nothing that won't happen with a spill someday (if you drive your wagon like Calvin & Hobbes)"
5,Best Body Wash On The Market!,"I have been using Olay Body Wash for about 5 yrs now and my skin is just beautiful. I am always getting compliments on how smooth and radiant it is. Even from total strangers. I suspect some of it is hereditary, but a great deal of it is because I take care of it by using OBW every day. I recommend it to anyone who ask. AF"
4,"An excellent source for photos, but not much documentation..","This book contains some of the best photographs regarding this subject matter. Most of them I have never seen before. However, the photo captions are not very detailed, often being no longer than six words. Several photos do not even have captions. Be wary of the author's designations as well. There is a long-barreled ""Pz.Kpfw. IV"" on page 166, which is really a Pz.Kpfw. VI Ausf. E."
4,A clear and documented picture of modern slavery,"As far as I'm concerned, this book only scratches the surface in regard to the dangers of powerful corruption in the hands of those at the top of a global economy. Suspiciously averse to pointing out what I consider to be an increasing wedge of slavery in the U.S., Bales nevertheless paints a clear and documented picture of slavery elsewhere that the U.S. clearly benefits from. We need more books like this, and Anti-Slavery International <http://www.antislavery.org> definitely needs more help and promotion. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money. Anyone who runs a website can give them a hand.Read this book. Give it for Christmas. More, now than ever, how workers are being viewed and exploited is the most important window on where our government is going in 2004."
3,Good bur Redundant...,"I liked this book a lot. It was a huge eye-opener to the depressions of slavery in the world today. I never realized it was so bad. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that the author tended to say the same thing over and over. He would just re-word what he had previously stated. He could have had the same impact in less pages. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone who has an interest (or not) in slavery. Everyone needs to know that this kind of stuff goes on in our world today."
3,Rock On Christian Vintage,"Christian Vintage offers a selection from the 70s and 80s. You'll hear early ""hippy Jesus music"" of the 70s from The Doobie Brothers and Grand Funk Railroad. But the real gems of this CD come from Pacific Gas & Electric, Birtles and Goble, and Argent. The 80's music is a bit of a stretch and has a very dated sound. If you are interested in how the Jesus Movement of the 70s affected Christian music, then this CD will give you a glimmer."
5,WOW!,"This is a fantasic album. Completely enjoyable from track 1 to 9. I have never written an amazon review before, but this extraordinary album has ennerved me to do so. ""Cry"" is also very good but not as strong throughout as ""Believe."" From here I would suggest exploring Jenny Scheinman and Nels Cline's works on Crypto as well. It has opened up a whole new world for me. Todd Sickafoose, Todd Ettinger, Erik Friedlander here I come.Seriously, this is coming from a guy who likes Leonard Cohen, Willie Nelson, John Prine; but also Fugazi, Buddy Guy, Fran Zappa, and Mos Def. If good music hits you right in the middle of your chest - give Scott Amendola a try."
5,Outstanding,"Want to glimpse into the life of a family led by a person sold out to religion? Want to enter into the dynamics and the unraveling and heart wrenching that authoritative religion too often leaves in its wake? Read this book and find yourself getting drawn into the all-too-familiar story, which may even be your story. This fictional book will teach what thousands of sermons fail to achieve! A must read for all of us who want to do it right but fail to realize, we can do nothing without HIM!"
3,Britain Alone,"The book raised some interesting points and worth a read. However I don't believe that the German invasion would have made it much further inland than 10 miles after the landings. The RN would have destroyed the majority or the landing craft, the RAF could have pulled back to its Northern bases and been out of reach of the Bomber whilst still providing cover for the ground forces. The defences and Home guard would of been enough to have seen off the para drops, remember it was luck and spirit in Normandy that got the para through. The germans would have been starved of ammo and food, the RN was at least 10-1 advantage in terms of destroyers and battleships. For the invasion to have worked the build up would have been much earlier and would have been obvious to the British and French what was coming, and in 1937 we could of started to get ready."
3,Dunked,"Anyone who knows me will know my fascination with the German plans to invade Britain and why.I have read many books on the subject including Peter Fleming's Operation Sea Lion.This book is not as well researched as most. And the conclusions are hard to accept since Britain was demoralized from France and very low on ammunition and the Germans were very good. Once the Krauts are across, they live off the land and can be supported by air. Once the panzers are across and first armored division done in it's over. It would have been as messy as Crete, but the result would still be the same.Personally, I doubt Hitler really planned to do it. Though the plans were elaborate, the details and praparations were very shallow. I believe he was trying to bluff the Brits into a peace deal."
3,Audio Chinese for Dummies more useful,"For my 10 day tour of China, the audio CD's were more useful in learning polite phrases than this book. This book had more information than I needed or could absorb and its CD was poorly constructed compared to the Audio version of Chinese for dummies which pronounced the English phrase, the Chinese phrase, gave time for me to repeat, and then repeated the Chinese phrase so I could compare."
3,cheap option for beginners,"These balls are cheap and it shows. They're not filled all the way making them somewhat awkwardly shaped, not really spherical. They're also not all filled the same amount, giving them slightly different individual weight. That being said, they get the job done fairly well. I have my doubts about the long term durability of these things, but in the short term they're fine, if you're looking to try out juggling to see if you like it, but don't want to spend a lot of money in case you don't, then these balls are perfect. If you're already into juggling and just want a cheap set to mess around with, I would suggest something a little higher quality than these."
1,too small,I thought i was ordering classic juggling balls when actually i got very small balls - half the size -and one was very badly packed so not easy to use.
4,Juggling Fun,Overall these are very good juggling balls. The only thing I would say is that they are all not the same size and weight. Other than that they are great for practice and have been quite durable.
1,2nd purchase went wrong.,Length:: 1:11 Mins-1 stars for the balls from A&N; Books and Toys. 4 Stars for the balls from Power Tek Sales.
1,RIP,dont buy balls rip very easily. spend the money on better ones because they will break in no time. i spent 15 dollars to get good ones thats what i suggest
4,Very nice,"I'm pleased with the construction of the balls, they're not coming apart anytime soon...only thing was that there was a lot of little loose threads that started coming out after I'd been practicing with them a while, but other than that, they're fine!"
2,Juggling Balls,The balls are in fine condition and I can juggle them easily but they smell disgusting!! I don't know what happened or if it is something inside them but those juggling balls smell gross and so do my hands after I use them.
1,WAY overpriced,"At $45, this case is way overpriced. It arrived today, looking and feeling like cheap, shiny plastic. It is not leather, that's for sure. It might be worth $15-$20, but A) I paid $45 and B) if I wanted a cheap-looking case, I would have bought one for $15-$20. This is the type of thing you get free when you make a $100 purchase from Fingerhut. It's going back."
5,IRONMIKE IL.,"I PURCHASED THIS 17""LEATHER LAPTOP COMPUTER CASE ON 1-11-07 AND RECEIVED IT ON 1-17-07.FOR THE PRICE OF $19.99+ SHIPPING THIS IS A GREAT BUY.BUT IF YOU WANT A DIFFERENT STYLE AND HIGHER PRICE AMAZON HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED TO CHOSE FROM.BUT THE ONE I BOUGHT I'AM HAPPY WITH."
2,Bad Fall,"This story was a bit much. I had obvious Dee Dee figured out way before they did. Clumsy Claire just kept falling into trouble so Hero Nick could race to the rescue. And what a lame ending!. Why did it take a year after all the tragic events to get around to taking down the bridge? And our star crossed lovers still weren't married? I wonder if anyone has tested silk ties to see how much weight they will support tossed over a rough steel girder of a bridge? This story started out pretty good, mystery and an attraction between two people, but it fell apart somewhere 1/2 way through. I was just skimming through the pages at the end untill it was somewhat tied up and explained. The author tried a little too hard to weave every thing in to one story and it was not very cohesive. Even absent dad rallied at the end in spite of his constant dialysis treatments.Sorry Ms Harper try again"
5,Like reading a really good Nancy Drew mystery!,"Karen Harper's tale of ""The Falls"" depicted a fearless heroine, romantic suspense and descriptive settings for this fast paced story. Hard to put down till the end and I'll be looking forward to her next one!"
1,"no show, no go","Unfortunatly, after two tries at getting a copy of this DVD that wasn't damaged in transit, Amazon decided that they weren't going to try a third time. I was able to get the DVD from another provider and hence was able to watch this excellent film. It's just too bad that Amazon wasn't able to provide it for me."
2,Zorntomas,"I am sorry , i want to like this album allot more than i actually do . First off , it just sounds like a cheap , uninspired Fantomas re-tread . Mike Patton is my favorite musician , and John Zorn is someone i have appreciated for years . Which is why i am giving this album two stars instead of one . Although , i do enjoy the title track "" moonchild "" immensely . If the rest of the album operated on that wave-length , instead of trying to be the less talented little brother of Fantomas , then i would have enjoyed this album allot more ."
2,Doesn't fit ID cards,"My primary use for this item was to carry my house key, debit card and ID. Contrary to what is advertised, my ID and credit cards do not fit into the wallet. I am disappointed because I was looking forward to using it! If you only want to fit in 1-2 keys and some cash then it will be very useful. But it does NOT fit any cards."
1,Misleading -- Holds Nothing More than Paper Money,"I was excited to purchase this product based upon its description. I bought it believing that it would hold my ID, cash and perhaps keys. But the pocket is so very small that it will not hold a standard size card -- bank card, ID card or health insurance card -- which is what is recommended for joggers, etc. to keep on them. So in effect, this was useless. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought the Ipaq 1935 and the screen cracked when going from cold (outside of my house) to warm (inside of my house). HP says it is not covered under warraty. I bought another (the fool I am)the LCD on this one broke after 2 days! I did nothing to this machine. It broke while attached to my hip. It too was not covered under warranty. HP is not what it used to be. I strongly encourage to buy another brand. I have no beef with Amazon. They are great.
1,Defective Cordless Mouse,This combo package of cordless mouse and cordless number pad had a defective mouse ... the gift recipient is returning it to me to seek a warranty replacement from the mfgr or the seller ...
4,Gotta love wireless...,"Love the wireless. The mouse is kinda cheaply made - I have a diffrent mouse, but I bought this for the Keypad/calc. Happy with the Keypad."
1,2 Flaws in Excel,"everything works fine except for two flaws in Excel: on the numpad, the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key. this is unacceptable, i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games. logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products, but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings. i will never buy logitech again."
4,Excellent!,I'm very impressed with this book. I enjoyed playing and singing these songs a lot. I also thought the book was well laid out so songs were easy to find in it.
1,Socialist realism at its worst,"I found this account of life on a collective farm totally boring. The only reason I can see for reading it is to experience a good example of what socialist realism can do to writing. The story and characters did not engage my interest. After reading this novel, I felt as bleak as the life it describes."
5,Bonamassa's new CD is awesome!!,"This CD is worth every penny and more! Bonamassa does it again, even better than his last album!! He is a true blues artist. He ranks up there with the best! If you don't have this album you are really missing something amazing."
3,Muddy Sounding and Disappointing,"I've been a fan of Joe for a while. I've seen him live twice. Once in the US and once in the UK and I will see him again in Moscow, Russia in October 2007. That said, I was really disappointed with this CD. The sound is muddy throughout and he sounds like he is playing with his amp in a tiled bathroom or something. Joe's usually strong voice is also very muted and he doesn't really belt it out like usual. The two originally acoustic covers that he does here. One by the late, great Chris Whitley ""Ball Peen Hammer"" and the other ""Seagull"" by Bad Co. are diminished by adding violins and other instrumentation. On Seagull the slide work should have been done on an acoustic instead of electric guitar.On the title track the guitar sounds like it was recorded with the microphone in another room down the hall. Throughout the singing sounds uninspired and strangely muted. I got the impression that he was not sure where he wanted to go with this CD and ended up nowhere."
5,Maggie's Review,"One would not need to use 1000 words to describe this album. When the melodies are heard, Jesus can be felt running through your soul. Amen"
1,Poor Quality Control,"When assembling the Electron I found the holes attaching the handlebars to the upright had been bored over size. Some of the socket head cap screws, provided for attachment, went straight through the holes without gripping any thread. Others had so little thread in the holes that tightening would have stripped what thread was there. This item should never have been packaged for sale. For this type of error there must be many more out in the marketplace suffering from the same problem."
3,Bizarre theoretical musings on a cultural relic.,"The Claude Glass, a mirror made of black glass used by landscape painters to judge hues, is, as this work demonstrates, a potentially rich source of metaphor and allegory. This is an intriguing but occasionally obtuse text that attempts to locate deep cultural meaning implied in the black mirror's disturbing and sometimes contradictory symbolism."
2,Buy on sale only,I bought two of these Tulliani belts for just under $20 each. A good deal at that price. Anybody who paid the full price would be disappointed
4,A book I read based on the title alone,"Sneaking around, discovering what other teens or adults were up to, solving crimes, ahh, I loved this series.I read the entire series as a kid, and loved it. It chronicles two brothers and their friends adventures as they solve mysteries of all imaginable kinds. I only learned as an adult that Franklin W Dixon was a pen name used by several different authors, but the series had some great stories. I still enjoy a good mystery.Paul Buckner,author of ""From Broke to Broker, and other stories of finding financial freedom."""
5,An 8 second ride of pure Americana she-rock,"This album is a breath of fresh air to anyone who is into the Americana rock scene. These two unbelievable rockabilly goddesses grabbed my attention from track one and did not let go until the end of the CD. It was more like and Hour long ride of spicy roots country rock. The CD lead out with ""Why is it Always Raining"" co-written by upstart rockabilly writer Wayne Wigley. This track is upbeat and saddening all at the same time. It's catchy beat and melancholy lyrics plays havoc with your rockin country soul. Later in the CD ""Come Back Baby"" tugs at your heart, and you find your self wanting to come back to the lovely voice of the singer. Late in the CD the title-track ""8 second ride"" displays the life and love of the rodeo circuit. For anyone who is into rock'in country that doesn't sound like current Nashville pop, should definitely pick this album up today."
2,Did Not Include Some Essential Information,"I've read this book and includes some valuable information. However, it is almost unforgivable that the author does not mention a threat to authors, and that is ""vanity presses"" as way to self-publish. ""Vanity presses"" are businesses that appeal to the ""vanity"" of the authors. They usually ask authors some money ahead so they publish their works. Because of this, they usually have dubious business practices. Ironically this book suggests a list of presses in which some names of the list are suspected of being vanity presses.On the other hand, I find it incredible that it does not include Lulu as being one possible way to self-publish.So, in good conscience I cannot recommend this book."
4,OK for first timers,"I have read a major portion of this book. It is a good reference guide. I have used it as a companion for other self-publishing how to books. If you are attempting to self-publish for the first time, this book is a help, but don't rely on it for all the information needed to get the job done."
2,OK at first but then...,"I first installed my Basepump in Spring 2010. It worked ok for several months, then during the winter it seemed to be not working.I checked outlet for freezing but seemed like no blockages in effluent pipe or inside the pump. I waited for Spring thaw to see a if any difference, no changes.After exhausting my troubleshooting options and verifying proper feed water flow, I contacted the company to return for repair or replacement.They tested it and said it was fine. I tried it again without success.So it is sitting here without resolution to whatever problem exists.I know it can work and did for some months, but just don't know what happened to it, so can't say I am happy."
3,REasonable Bag,Unfortunately my bag did not arrive with the shoulder strap. The bag does have several compartments on the inside. This can help with sorting out small items but it is not so good when you have a bulky item to carry along. There is a removable internal divider. It can be great for sorting documents. Removing it helps when you need some consolidated space in the main compartment.The bag closes by folding the flap over. Sometimes insides of the bag may still be exposed the elements. The flap has to be buckled to stay in place. This makes it a bit difficult to quickly reach into the bag and close it again.The flap has two zippered compartments which can be used to store items for easy reach while the bag is closed.
2,"Mainly a Reprint of ""Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding""","I have a copy of ""Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding"" by Bruce grant and it has sort of become my bible for leather braiding and complex knot work as well a source for making braided western tack. I love it so much that when I came across this book ""How to Make Cowboy Horse Gear"" by Bruce Grant and Lee M. Rice I had to have it. I was mainly looking for a deeper treatment of tack making to help fill in the details that were not covered in ""Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding."" I was very disappointed to discover that all but the section on saddle making by Lee M. Rice at the end of the book (about 40 pages) is a reprint from the ""Encyclopedia of Rawhide and Leather Braiding"". Just buy the Encyclopedia do not waste your money on this book."
2,Not curved,I was afraid to put this on my Gibson because it is not curved to fit the body. It is a flat plate.
2,DECEPTIVE,This book appears to be a normal size book in its add on the web but is infact only 2 1/2 inches wide and 3 inches long.Nowhere do they tell you that. I was ordering for adults not children.Thank You for your time.Sarah Matthews
1,NOT written by Hashim Khan!,"Let the record show that this book was not written by Hashim Khan. The only book authored by Hashim Khan is ""Squash Racquets - The Khan Game"" with Richard Randall."
3,Almost does what I need,"I did not buy this for the navigation but rather to plot a couple hundred places of interest. It can import addresses just fine from Excel, but I also needed it to display name, address and phone number for each place by default. I haven't found how to do that, if it will do that at all. But, I select each location, choose the information to display then I have what I want."
2,Strange putrid smell,The pills smell horrible and make me a bit nauseous when attempting to take them. Will need to purchase another brand.
3,Cute scooter but wait to buy,Bought for son when he was 2 but probably would have waited to buy a more flexible one when he was three. It does not turn well at all.
5,son loves it,i bought this after my 3 1/2 year old kept eyeing a neighbor on his ripskate. my son loves it. he is so willing to put on his helmet and pads. we take it for a ride to the park. and i can easily hook the handle bar over my umbrella stroller if he chooses to walk instead.the same neighbor gave us their old skateboard with a steering handle. my son still prefers his radio flyer. it has good steering and a wide base for him.someone remarked about its tipability. no problem. my son's taken a few falls--all within my watchful eyes. but the knee/elbow pads have always protected him. then it quickly got to a point where he would fall on purpose to scrape his pads. and he loves showing off the scratch marks from his pads. it's a great beginning scooter for a tot.
3,For tall 2 year olds - not short ones.,"Just bought this for my 2 year old daughter, as she's been admiring her older sister's Razor for a while and wanted her own. This one said ages 2-5 so I thought this one might work. She is on the petite side, a little under 33 inches and the handle bars are at the height of her neck so she had to reach up to grab them and if she puts one food down to move it, she has a hard time reaching the handle bars. Will look for something adjustable I guess or wait another year."
3,NOT THE STURDIEST,"WE LOOKED AT THIS MODEL AND SOME OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES AND DECIDED TO TRY THIS ONE OUT...SEEMED LIKE MOST PEOPLE WERE HAPPY WITH THEIRS. FIRST OFF, WE LIVE IN A VERY URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD WITH UNEVEN PAVEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY THIS SCOOTER IS JUST NOT HEAVY ENOUGH FOR ROUGH RIDING. IT KEPT TIPPING OVER AND MY KIDS KEPT FALLIN OFF. I THINK IT'S DECENTLY MADE FOR THE PRICE BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL LAST AWHILE GO WITH THE MICRO SCOOTER."
5,Amazing book,"This book will change your life. He was a brilliant, gentle soul full of insight and wisdom. Buy the book!"
3,Worth reading...once,"This book is nice, and a great way to remember Mr. Rogers, who evidently was as wonderful a person as could ever be. But it is written from a very personal point of view--so if you are looking for more of a biography or profile of Fred Rogers this is not the one. Some reviewers have complained about the overt Christianity in the book. Hello! He was a minister after all! And a Christian one! Anyhow, the author gives many examples of how Mr. Rogers was never too busy for her and her family, even though they were not close friends. Pretty cool."
3,Appealing but Lite,"I appreciate the author's honesty and sincerity - and have no doubt that she had a special friendship with Mister Rogers. But the book lacks depth (also commented upon by another reviewer). The author states that Fred Rogers greatly admired and was a friend of Henri Nouwen, that renowned priest, pastor, professor and writer of the 20th century, yet also admits that she has read nothing of Nouwen. My sense is that she doesn't have the background to be able to articulate the contemplative heart of Rogers' faith. It is a friendly, easy read, appealing for all who love Mister Rogers - so see it as an introduction to the spiritual perspectives of this wonderful man, but not, by any means, as a full representation of his profound and visionary faith in Christ."
3,Too easy and too short,"Gameplay is cool, but the game is a little on the easy side and way too short. It makes a better rental."
4,legends is awesome,when i got legends it took me awhile to get used to the controls. but once i did it was all easy from there. basicly its about a new mutant knowed as magma but it is also about the enternal strugle between x-men the brotherhood and the morlocks. the best part is they show every costume of every x-men from pheonix to human beast. but to play as jugarnaut and three diffrent types of sentinal is cool to. i wont give away everything for fear of a toungelash from toad
4,But what if they won't reconcile?,"This is a good read if the relationship is re-concilible. But you don't want to stay in the Hope Stage. The e-guide I've been recommending to my clients goes thru 6 Stages, leading to the Growth Stage. You can see it on [...]"
5,First rate phone,"This phone is the highest rated cordless of the 143 that Amazon offers, and for good reason: equipment quality, sound clarity, and low price, offering the advantages of speakphone *and* cordless for less than half the price of similar products!"
3,Some Concerns,"I bought 2 Panasonic KX-TG2216FV phones based on the glowing recommendations and also steered a neighbor to buy the same phone model. Positives are that all 3 owners really like the features on this phone and the voice quality sounds superb to the caller on the other line. However we are all experiencing the same INTERMITTENT problem with the connection disappearing for a few seconds or altogether dropping. Maybe it was a faulty batch but the phones were bought from different sources. I suspect that this phone is particulary sensitive to any other devices in the neighborhood that use the same 2.4 Ghz frequency. My microwave is mounted on the other side of the wall and when it is 'active' the phone is unusable (conversation undecipherable). That is the only device I have that competes in that same frequency space. At this point I am weighing which will be more annoying, these intermittent disturbances or going through the process of selecting and replacing this phone."
2,irritating,"This book has some interesting stories of chemical discoveries. But the economics is hopeless, and the broader history potted. Preachy in places and often repetitive."
4,Excellent collection of science factoids,"I really enjoyed how much I learned from this book. It was slow to start, but once I got into the ""dense"" writing style, I learned so much, and can now really appreciate the critical balance between natural and man-made substances and their effects on the environment. A very fascinating read."
4,Organic chemistry and history,"Although the chemical formulas can be a bit daunting, especially for someone without scientific background, this is really an interesting read. Are you curious where everyday items,conveniences and d rugs come from? Then you will be rewarded with this book. I do have a scientific education yet I didn't know where and why plastics were developed, how synthetic rubber was developed, how the birth control pill came to be or why the Dutch gave up Manhattan. I learned something"
5,I Didn't Want to Put the Book Down!,"And I didn't. I read the entire book in one sitting! Susan Nusser depicts the lives of these professional horsepeople (and their horses) with humor and sensitivity. Her writing made me feel like I was there with the horses and their handlers. Not only was the book interesting, but it was informative. It makes you think about your own abilities and qualities as a horseperson."
2,Only 3 Zamfir tracks on this CD,"Don't be misled that this is a Zamfir CD. Only tracks 1 (parts a & c), 5 and 10 feature Zamfir. The other artists on this disc include Horizont (tracks 1b, 7, 12), Dagobert Bohm (guitar, track 3), Richard Souther (Synthesizer, tracks 2, 4, 8, 11, 13) and Amy Shreve (Harp, track 6). Unfortunately the music isn't as relaxing as the picture on the cover. For Zamfir fans, you can find versions of the 3 tracks on this CD featured on other Zamfir CD releases such as ""The Tranquil Sound of the Pan Pipes"", ""The Beautiful Sound of the Pan Pipes"" and ""Folksongs from Rumania""."
2,Not what I thought it was needed the main contraoller not sure what this will do,It was not what I thought it was and had to return it. I am currently waiting for a credit from the company.
4,Nice Live Junkies,"Previously released as a DVD only, it is nice to have a CD to go along with the DVD. It is well worth the price of admission in particularly for a somewhat more aggressive ""Sweet Jane"" highlighting Mike Timmins stellar guitar work, as well as an extended ""32-20 Blues"". Other standouts are ""Pale Sun"" and ""He Will Call You Baby"". The concert footage is excellent due to great performances of both old and newer selections. The DVD has 7 additional songs. My only gripe is that this combo CD and DVD should have been the only release. Having two releases is kind of a rip off of the longtime fans of this great Canadian group. Hence only 4 stars rather than 5."
5,Excellent buy from Farberware,"In my mind, nylon tools are definitely the way to go to preserve the life of your cookware. I worked at a department store in the Housewares department for several years and experienced first hand the destruction metal utensils can do to top of the line pots. Farberware is a name brand that is trusted and rightly so. This spatula is well worth the money invested in it. It is made from a thick material that can resist high temperatures for a longer period of time without succumbing to the heat. Of course I don't recommend leaving any plastic or nylon utensil on a hot pot for any extended duration. But, if you dart off to answer the phone in the middle of preparing a meal, this utensil will not look like a spatula in a Dali painting. I've had mine for over a year now and it is holding up excellently."
2,Very time consuming,This is NOT the most user friendly piece of software I have ever used. As long as you have lots of time on your hands (I am retired) you can arrive at the information you need/want. I purchased this software in a hurry and wish that I had taken more time to research other software choices available to me.
1,"Might be good for laptop, but no Pocket Streets 2007","I purchased this product because I figured it was simply the follow-on to MS&T; 2006 which *came* with Pocket Streets 2006. I already have a PDA and BT Gps and simply wanted better navigation software and up-to-date maps. It's very difficult to determine what capabilities are included in these packages.The short answer is that MS&T; 2007 does not include PS 2007. To the best of my searching, as of 12/29/2006 there is no PS 2007. Further searching revealed that PS 2006 is simply a map package that will show you where on the map you are with a GPS, but does not provide point-to-point voice navigation.Since I travel with a PDA and not a laptop, this was a complete waste of money."
3,Microsoft Losing Interest in Streets.,"I've always liked Microsoft Streets. It was a good product for a reasonably cheap price. Also, I could download maps to my PDA because it came with Pocket Streets. It's no longer as cheap as it used to be, it doesn't come with Pocket Streets anymore. You have to get Pocket Streets from Streets 2006 if you can find it; Microsoft isn't making any other provision. So essentially you are paying full price for the product and only getting map data updates. They don't even indicate on the box or in the literature that it no longer comes with Pocket Streets. It looks like Microsoft is getting ready to shelve another product."
3,could be better,"i was expecting more from this product. It takes a very long time to download. The directions were not very accurate, tried to use it in Las Vegas, i thought since it is the 2007 version it would be kind of up dated,it was not!. Some streets were missing!. I had to use mapquest to get directions to those locations. a lot of times it made me take back roads when there were shorter ways to get to my location. If you are not trying to get some fancy program and have all the time in the world when traveling, go ahead! get it! If not, look for something else."
2,"Microsoft, you're no Mapquest","Made a mess of my maps I made with its predecessor, adding false addresses to existing ones. It does not interface with outlook, and it still can't find about 30% of the exact addresses I put in it- it just puts a 'pushpin' randomly someplace on the road. I mainly bought it because they swapped names on two highways (J and 164) that I use regularly, and there are a lot of new roads that my old version didn't have. I use it mainly as a visual address book, so it does do that. But I don't see any significant improvements/features over previous versions."
5,Streets & Trips,"I previously had the Streets & Trips 1998 Version. The 2007 version has been greatly improved with the addition of many streets that weren't on the 98 Version. An added advantage is that you can install the entire program to your hard drive and not have to find the run disk when you want to look something up,"
1,Disappointed,Didn't like anything I made out of this cookbook. I had the same problem with her uncheese series. I guess I will stick with the cookbooks I've been using.
5,The Antidote to Bad TV,This great series really draws you in until you start thinking that these are real people in your life. There's such a wealth of entertainment here. You really can't go wrong.
3,Still doesn't convert this Socom player,"While this game did some housecleaning, a few poor aspects remain:- Search engine still blows. Aral Sea has become the new quarry, and there is no way to block that trash out of the server list that take upwards of 45 secs to show up. You can't select any game types when using the ""optimatch"", just one of three general modes(which has a possibility of 24 variations). You can't exclude camper friendly ""no explosives"" matches that the underskilled users tend to run. There's no excuse, the first Ghost Recon(XBL launch) had a better set-up.- Design maps for 32 players and have a 16 player cap.- Have sniper rifles that don't sway. While there at it why not make the rocket launcher automatic?- Red X. They have lots of nerve to pull the same stunt twice. These sorts of errors aren't supposed to occur with my Samsung-enabled xbox. I still get randomly kicked from rooms and the default kit has a cheesy weapon."
4,pretty much the same as GR2,"Summit Strike is to Ghost Recon 2 as Island Thumder is to Ghost Recon 1. There all about the same...The main thing I like about the Ghost Recon games are the ""save anywhere"" ability (and it saves instantly). The pacing moved up a bit from the GR1 games to GR2 games and up again in GRAW..."
4,CD please!!!!,"I loved the Christmas songs while watching the movie on 3D back then, but never found a CD online. And now i see all this music only available on itunes :(Why on earth was a CD not released ?!! :("
3,review #3,"The music truly comes from the heart, but you need to work on your lyrics. The words don't seem to be in time with the song. Also, the last production I went to had too much of an artificial sound. You need a live orchestra! Other than these small flaws, I enjoyed the music and production overall."
2,Be careful of the point in front!,"I cannot give this toy a high mark because I have found, after having the toy for almost 2 years, that you really need to be careful when letting your toddler play with it because of the pointy front. The point on the front is made of hard plastic and can damage walls, refrigerator doors, etc. in your home. I know because this happened to us. We have a new refrigerator that was damaged in this way. I would suggest gluing a piece of soft carpeting or something to the front so your home doesn't get damaged, too!"
5,Perfect.,"I was a little leary about buying earrings online. But when they arrived the earrings were perfect. Beaufiful quality, exactly what I had hoped for. The box they came in was too big. Would have preferred a smaller earing box, for the small earrings. But that being my only complaint, I am very satisfied."
1,Terrible,"After a few days of use you must get an activation code. But just try to reach the company for the code. After being told by their computer to hold for the next rep, after a while they dump you to voice mail. Of course they never call back.A big wast of $75."
1,"Dark Clouds on the Horizon, White Clouds on the Screen","Has anyone obtained satisfaction from SONY over the Mura Defect issue?SONY seem to be in serious denial mode.For many, the picture quality is Great .... until they attempt to view it in a darkened room.Then, in the darker scenes, irregular patches of light cloudy appearance are evident on very many of the LCD screens that have been shipped over the past several months.My warning to anyone who is contemplating a purchase ..... make sure that where you purchase it from gives you have the option of returning it (without punitive restocking or shipping costs).For me the Sony KDL-46XBR2 is a major purchase.I do not want to buy a nightmare.If you want to learn more about the issue, I suggest that you do a web search on ""Sony KDL-46XBR2 mura defect"".All the above are my personal opinions and observations.Good Luck to all in this Holiday Season."
4,Not quite a perfect 10 - but close.,"I've had this set for a few days and for the most part am quite happy with it. This set replaced my 1080i Samsung DLP. The brightness and colors on the Sony KDL-46XBR2 are tops. HD Broadcast channels look fabulous and movies on up-converting DVD player (Oppo DV981HD) look great. The SD broadcast channels also look quite good. Using HDMI connections eliminate much of the cable clutter.On the down-side, I can observe the much discussed cloud issue but mostly on a blank, no-imput screen. Not significant in normal viewing."
5,Spectacular picture,"In spite of some misgivings because of the spate of recent ""cloud"" and ""mura"" issues I decided to go with the Sony Bravia XBR 46"" LCD. I looked at a lot of plasmas in this size range, and I just did not like the reflections from the shiny surface and faded look in normal daylight situations. My home is NOT kept like a dark movie theatre! I see no ""cloud"" problems. The picture is bright with great contrast in even a brightly lit room. I think CR was right in giving this the highest rating. Pricey, but worth it if you want to spend the extra bucks compared to a budget model like Vizio or Spectre. Coupled with Verizon FIOS with HDMI input, and an Oppo DVD this combination makes me smile!"
5,BEST HD TV ON THE MARKET,"I did a lot of research on this tv and finally decided to go with Amazon since they had the best price.I was kind of hesitant because of the cloud issue,but the pros outweighed the cons.The picture quality is awesome.I even liked the speaker sound. I did not need a home theatre system. But it makes the tv sound even better.We just need more HD channels with our cable company. I will give them a couple months. The HD really spoils you. I might have to get satelite. My paper said two man delivery but only one came and he had no problem. He placed the box where I asked him to since I was also waiting on a new tv stand.I would recommend buying this tv from Amazon."
2,"I Own a Cloudy 46"" XBR2","I bought my 46"" XBR2 from the Sony Style store in Tampa, Fl. The set is great but when viewing in a dark room during dark scenes or when switching between inputs I notice cloudiness in the areas of the screen that should be black. I contacted the manager of the Sony Style store here in Tampa and he informed me that I am not the only person with a defective panel and he placed me on a waiting list to receive a new set. He told me that at the moment they don't have any of these in stock and there are other customers with defective panels that are also waiting for a replacement. It seems that the panels that are affected were manufactured beginning in Sept If you own this panel and the Manufacture date on the back is September 2006 or later I urge you to view your set in a dark room , turn to a blank input or watch a movie with dark scenes pitch black, sin city, etc. I assume that about 1/2 of you will notice the cloudy areas of the screen"
1,Is This All After 88 Years?,"As a lifelong Chicago White Sox fan, I was thrilled upon hearing that the 2005 playoff and World Series games were being released on DVD in a boxed set. Alas, the thrill is gone.It took the White Sox 88 years since their last World Series win in 1917, yet the ""boxed set"" contains only 6 of the 12 total games played. What kind of ""boxed set"" is this????I videotaped all the games along with the pre and post game shows. This will be my ""boxed set"".SORRY A&E; HOMEVIDEO. You dropped the ball. I ain't buying."
4,Good Product but Pricy,"I liked the small tip. It's smaller than many other baby spoons. I like the long and non-slip handle. It's easier to feed my baby. I can give it 5 stars for the design and construction, but taking out 1 star becuase it's more expensive compared to other baby spoons."
3,"Started off good, but kind of fizzled...","I was pleasantly surprised when I started listening to this book. Quite frankly, the story was better than I had expected. There was good action, the hint of romance (that never came to fruition -- which was okay), and suspense. However, after awhile, the story seemed to get bogged down in historical details and lost some of its momentum. By the time I reached the ending, which by the way was pretty good, I'd lost some of my interest in the book. But overall, I'd say the book was a cut above average, but it could have been better. (Abridged audiobook version)"
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"The premise was interesting, but the book was tedious and unexciting. As the plot thickened, I found that I cared less and less about the characters and their unrealistic motives. There must be a good story in the Catholic involvement in WWII, but this is not it!"
5,The best vatican thriller I ever read!!!!,It is a masterpiece! A great story in the fascinating world of the Vatican. Full of history and politics. Suspenseful and very sophisticated. And contraversial!In times where the pope is about to die Assassini is even a more interesting book.
3,Superbly plotted but based on an absurd historical pretense,"The mosaic of the plot is skillfully put in place. Gifford's style is very refined and certainly entertaining. However, the book is full of historical hogwash. The excesses of the Borgias have as much to do with today's Vatican policy as Henry the VIII's divorce by decaputation has to do with the family life of the contemporary English royalty. Moreover, making any references to Paris as a center of any actual resistance to the Nazis is an insault to any even semi-informed reader. After nearly a decade of research, Mr. Gifford should know that only serious casualties suffered by the Germans in Paris were those inflicted by French prostitutes. C.K. Tchorznicki"
1,"Extremely long-winded, tedious and boring, with lousy hero","If you are looking for a ""unputdownable"" book, this is not it. I found this book to be extremely, extremely long-winded, tedious and boring. I only finished it as I did not want to waste my money. 700 odd pages is far too long. I also found it difficult to sympathise with such a bitter-natured protagonist. The more I read, the more I wanted to slap the ""hero"" for being so self-righteous. This book is only for people who have a lot of patience and if you are looking for a fast-paced Da Vinci Code type thriller, please look elsewhere."
5,Fascinating,"A great novel. Lots of intrigue. The characters were made to seem real. The story line was a black eye for the Catholic Church, however with so much factual information produced, it made the history of the church and the mysteries still being unraveled, plausible. It is a bit like the Da Vinci Code ."
2,Don't put lids in the dishwasher!,"I bought a lot of these containers in 4 different sizes. They are great if you do not put them in the dishwasher. The lids shrink just enough to make it extremely difficult to put them on the container, even when placed on the top rack of the dishwasher. The container seems to be OK but the lids do shrink. Luckily I realized this before it happened to all of them. Otherwise they are great containers but you need to hand wash the lids which is a big minus in my book."
3,Dictionary needed more words,"I bought this dictionary to help my chilren with their school work. If they get stuck on a word that they didn't know, all they had to do was go to this dictionary look up the word and that would give them the english.They did not have a lot of the words that the kids are learning in the bible. I had to remember what the root of the word was and try to look it up from there.The good part about the book is that my kids are able to use this book without me and can do a lot of their homework on their own. I would recommend this book to friends but advise them that they will still need a hebrew/english dictionary to help out in a pinch."
2,Not that Great,"I had been cooking (at home) for many years, and then took on cooking for 50-100 people once a week. I thought the book would help, but it wasn't very useful. All the information was just common sense and the tone of the book is talking down to you. Don't waste your time on a book, spend it cooking!"
3,"Great idea. However, refinements are needed.","This sander works well and is a strong tool. However, a few changes need to be made before it deserves a five star rating. First, the straight edge fence provided with this expensive product is trash. Porter Cable probable spent two or three cents on this important accessary (and it shows). Secondly, this tool needs a case. Porter Cable does not make a case to fit this sander. Thirdly, you must purchase an adapter plate to attach the sander to the P.C. router table (poor design). Otherwise, the sander is another strong and reliable tool from Porter Cable."
4,"A home improvement enthusiast from Porto Alegre, Brazil","I fully agree with the home improvement enthusiast from Phoenix, Arizona. By the way, great review (see it)."
4,Save your fingers!,Nice product that adjusts to large caliber magazines to load them up fast. I use mine on a .40 magazineand it does what you need it to do and for a good price.
3,Speed loader,"Construction is good and thumb cam lever is easy to use and ergonomic. The adjustable slide will only fit a 10rd 40 s&w at best and less if the magazine has a thick hand grip extension on it so I don;t know where they get the ""up to 15rds"" on a single stack magazine! If you put the slide lock behind the magazine and squeeze them together it works decent on the longer mags."
5,Excellent learning the dragon pole,"It is hard to find any good material on the weapons of wing chun. Finaly this is one of them...great. The dragon pole was introduced later in the wing chun system, it is mainly used to teach balance and precision...but almost in any surrounding you can find something that looks like a stick..so if you are really in trouble, than it might be handy to know how to handle one."
3,Satisfactory,"If you're getting this book for a college course, just know that I got this and I haven't even used it. All I really needed the book for was an online access code for the homework, which I bought directly from the website along with getting this book from amazon."
3,portfolio,"low rating because it will not hold 11 x 17 inch paper. I assumed that it would, that is what we needed not another small portfolio."
1,Not Vegetarian,It's not mentioned anywhere on the product page but the caps are made with gelatin.That's a bummer for those of us taking this as a vegetarian supplement.Definitely won't order again. I wish I knew this ahead of time.:(
2,KEEP LOOKING,"As anyone who's picked up a computer tutorial book knows, the nature of the experience (from a joyous pleasure to pure living ... of earth) and value of the book as a learning tool (a welcomed gift to a overpriced doorstop) is directly proportional to the number of steps left out or inaccurately described by the author. The errors in this book begin on page 13 (out of over 600) and by page 34 you're [done], unless you can lay your hands on the text and divine the missing steps. Not only that, but, because you have loaded HOT's files on your harddrive you'll find yourself with a partially finished site hidden somewhere and not a clue as to how to get the [darn] thing removed and error messages warning you of impending doom if you try to get around it. (For mac users, using Sherlock gets you nowhere.) I'm really disappointed with this book. It was a huge waste of money and time. I'll just keep looking. You do the same."
1,Fertility Traitement for men,"I bought this one for my husband and i take Fertility Blend for women, never mind was not working for us, we try it for 6 months and was a little desesperate situation, because of course you want to see the results inmediatly !!! but for the persons who have this kind of problem, i recomended begin fertility exercises like yoga, meditation, etc. is less stress and you help your mind and body to receive your angel, if you have one around you. Courage !!!"
2,Multicultural drivel,"Want to sum up this DVD in one sentence? How about ""Let's indoctrinate little American kids into believing Caucasian kids don't even EXIST and every playgroup is one big happy stew of Indians, Japanese, Latinos, Iranians, Africans, and 7 other semi-brown kids picked at random.""And unless you speak with an accent, you are NOT cool. If you don't inject a foreign language phrase or word into every other sentence, you are NOT cool. If you don't find a way to praise a non-American culture each time you speak up, you are NOT cool.I fully expected any second for all the kids to get up on a hill, hold hands, and praise Coca-Cola.A completely nauseating production that is almost guaranteed to make any kid of European ancestry feel odd and left out.Only reason I gave it 2 stars was because my kids stayed perplexed just long enough to watch it, so it saved me $5 on babysitting."
1,Lasted less than a year,"Bought this about about a year ago, and then it sat in a drawer for six months, so really only used the thing for about six months. After that the left button went. It felt fine, but sometimes the click would not register at all, and sometimes a drag registered as a double click.I called the support number mentioned in other reviews (800-360-7561) and it was still under warranty and they offered to replace it with a Comfort 6000, until they realized that mouse is also no longer produced. So instead I had to fax my receipt to them and they say they're going to send me a refund check in 4-6 weeks. Sigh.For what it's worth, I have 2 Intellimouse Explorer 3.0's that have worked great for years. It seems the 4.0 series is just major step backward."
2,"Good Mouse design, bad left click button","I'm on my second Intellimouse, the first one the left click button stopped working after a few months of use, I got a replacement from Microsoft, the second one has the same problem after another few months of use. Stay away from this mouse...poor quality."
2,Pretty bad,"I've had this mouse about 2 months now. It was my first experience with a tilt wheel, and the first thing I noticed is that to get the wheel to register as a tilt, you basically have to grab the wheel with 2 fingers and move it to the side. The scroll wheel is very difficult to click, and as a gamer, that's pretty annoying. The scroll wheel also refuses to register as clicking if the scroll wheel is scrolling at the same time.My main problem with this mouse is that now, after only 2 months of use, the left click button occasionally doesn't register a click whenever I press it. There is a small space between the actual click of the button and where the electrical circuit inside makes contact. It may sound bizarre, but again, as a gamer, often times I find myself clicking the button into exactly that ""dead zone"" and no click is registered.I'll be buying a Logitech next time."
2,Don't buy this mouse if you use AutoCAD!!,"The ""Tilt-Wheel"" technology does not function with AutoCADprograms. It will give you nothing but problems. Also like oneof the previous reviews stated. The Left pick wears out in amatter of 4-6 months! You'll start to notice that you have topick things 2, 3 or 4 times to activate. Some good points are:The shape is nice. Moves well, very fluid. The wheel rollssmooth, better than most mice devices. If you don't useAutoCAD it will be fine until the ""Left Pick"" starts to go."
4,The Mouse that could,This is a great mouse for things like excel spreadsheets where you have to move horizontally but for things like games where you use the scroll wheel to change weapons and such this mouse fails. The scroll wheel has no clicking motion to it. The wheel glides smoothly. This causes problems for pc gaming. I still give this mouse four stars b/c it feels and looks great and the tilt wheel is great. Also the customizable buttons on the mouse are cool. Thanks and peace out and vote Communism in 2004. Just kidding on the last part. I would never say peace out.
3,Wonderful mouse broke in less than a year,This is a great mouse if you don't play FPS or RPG games that require alot of clicking the left mouse button. The scroll functions are great but the mouse doesn't seem to hold up to abuse as well as my Intellimouse versions 2.0 and 3.0. Mine stopped being as senstive to left click about 9 months to the day i bought it (12/23/04-9/26/05). For lighter/ less intense users this is a great mouse. I will end up buying another one because even with the lack of durability this is a great mouse.
3,An All-Time Great with an Achilles Heel,"As others have noted, the left mouse button glitch cripples an otherwise fantastic product (mine started to get quirky just a few weeks after it's purchase). The two buttons on the left side have become a ""can't live without"" feature. The 4 way wheel (up-down-left-right) has also come in handy at times. All buttons are very customizable too.They have redeemed themselves - after a quick (5 minute) call to Microsoft's hardware support number (800-360-7561) today, they offered to ship a brand-new replacement - the Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 (no need to ship back the old one!). What a pleasure to have such responsive customer support with very few questions asked."
1,"Oh, what a difference another six months make: what was once a Five-Star rating is now a One-Star rating","Back on 9/5/05, I wrote a glowing Five-Star review of this mouse after six months of use. Mea culpa. After barely a year's worth of M-F 8-5 usage, it is now headed to the landfill. The switch under the left mouse button started failing a few weeks ago and finally quit altogether this past week. It took awhile to figure out how to disassemble the mouse without breaking anything, but I was able to confirm that, yes, it was indeed the left switch that was the culprit.As seen with other reviews here and elsewhere, this is an all-too-common complaint. That being the case, I felt obliged to delete my original Five-Star review and replace it with this One-Star review.Bottom line: this is a one-year-and-done mouse. If you like its ergonomics, the IntelliPoint software's interfacing with Microsoft Office, and you don't mind replacing it annually, buy it. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,"bad mouse, good instant customer service",also had a problem with left clicker thanks to the reviewer here i called microsoft and they shipped a replacement Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 with no charge or having to return the mouse.thats customer service!Microsoft's hardware support number (800-360-7561)dial 0 when the menu starts
2,Wolf in sheep's clothing...,"I purchased this mouse at another online store back in February to replace an old intellimouse that was acting up. Upon initial use, i was really loving it...cool design, smooth feel...but now (less than 2 months later) I am having problems left-clicking. I find that I have to left-click mulitple times in order for it to work. Since I work in graphic design...this is very counter-productive and annoying. I tried getting it replaced with Microsoft's mouse replacement plan and was denied because it was an OEM mouse, which I was unaware of until I checked the product ID number on the bottom.I would suggest that if you are going to take a chance with this mouse, that you purchase the RETAIL version in case you need to take advantage of the replacement warranty. It appears that Microsoft refuses coverage of OEM parts and products."
1,Left click button going bad on mine too,I too love the feel and the features of this mouse but after about a year of office use the left click button is failing. Now it takes 2 clicks or one very deliberate click to make it work. I'm very disappointed in this mouse.
2,Left Click Problem,"This is a wonderful mouse in so many aspects... great ergonomics, very smooth scroll wheel and all the needed buttons -- except for one very serious flaw. The left mouse click button only lasts for about a year in normal use. I've had two of these mice and the same problem sent each of them headed to the landfill. Other reviewers have had the same problem. It's a shame that Microsoft hasn't owned up to the problem and offered an exchange program. They designed a great product, but the quality of construction just doesn't do this product justice."
5,Great Quality and Transferred my Phone number flawlessly,"After using Packet8 for over 6 months now, I am completly happy with the service and have saved a ton of money on my phone bill. After the first two months, I requested they port my landline phone #, that process went flawlessly and I dropped my SBS service completely. The porting process takes approximatley 5 weeks.I have read some negative reviews here, and am totally surprised by them, everything has gone completley smoothly for me without any hitches or problems.This service is great!"
2,Feedback on the line and static,"I've used this service for almost 8 months now. A lot of times, there's a feedback on the line (I can hear my own voice). My friends and family also tell me that they can hear static on the line when they're talking to me - at first I dismissed it as their phones but given enough complaints and that when I'm on my cell phone that doesn't happen I'm convinced it's the service.I also think they deserve a low score because when compared to their competitors they don't have the same number of features even though they cost about the same."
4,I with it had a Mets WHN radio play by play alternate audio track.,This set is very good my only nit pick is that I wish it had alternate play by play audio track with Bob Murphy and Gary Thorne from WHN Radio.
5,The new era of dot coms,"Paul was able to take decades of theory on Consumer Relationship Management and tie it together with emerging technologies in a way that is easy to understand, and above all: accurate.A must read for any business interested in staying in business by meeting the demands of their consumers through the deployment of CRM solutions.Using the Internet to attract, manage, and retain customers will be a requirement for businesses to grow in the new economy. Of special interest to me was the section on emerging Native Application Service Providers (NASP's) and how they are able to deploy solid eCRM solutions in weeks as opposed to the months/years (if ever) for the delivery of traditional CRM solutions."
5,A great way to live,"I finished reading this book in just under a couple of hours, but it is full of wonderful and helpful words to live by. It is written in clear simplicity with profound messages. It's a book to pick up over and over again to remind us to live with love and clarity. Both Jacob Liberman, and his son, Erik are two human beings with an abundance of wisdom and joy that have graced me with their friendship and have helped me grow along the way."
2,Not helpful in learning/teaching,"While some of this book, from the teaching how to tune the Guitar to the learning of the Major, Chromatic etc. scales, there is no real value to this book for any other reason and it is so short that if one could learn from it, they would require a new one rapidly."
4,Great read,"Couldn't put the book down. I'm anxious to get the next book, and start on reading it. Great finish and start!"
3,Sprinkles With The Bes,Tastes like powdered garlic (essential) and comes in handy when making quick garlic bread. Just brush bread with butter and sprinkle: Voila! Garlic bread to grand enough to shame the folks at Applebee's or Chili's. Seriously gourmet!
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Everything you are reading about this nasty program is correct. While it looks cool and has a very nice new Graphical User Interface... that's about all it does. It is by far the worst Windows update ever! I got my DVD today and performed the upgrade... which it would not do, and needed to install a clean copy of Vista. The entire process took about 50 minutes... WITHIN 30 minutes I was already doing a factory restore back to XP Media Center... NONE OF MY XP programs worked with Vista. Wait until they fix this horrible program! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! It's not worth it. This version has NO features... all the Media Center options are totally removed from the Business upgrade... All around it's a nightmare. PS you have to buy special Vista Anti-Virus... there are not many companies offereing ""FREE"" upgrades to Vista.MICROSOFT... WHAT A MESS YOU HAVE MADE! Does anyone remember Windows ME? Yeah I didn't think so... well meet the new Windows ME!So Sad!"
2,Ehhh...,"I'm a guy who loves quirky, non-mainstream, electronic, weird music. So my problem with this album isn't that it's not ""normal."" My problem is it's just not ""good.""The electronics are quirky and funny. They boop and beep and sound like an early version of a Casio keyboard. The style of music sounds like something somebody cooked up in his basement. It's got a great low-fi vibe -- real outsider music.That said, I don't find this particularly charming. Okay, so it's a little charming. But not enough to merit shelling out dough. It's a cultural artifact, and as such, you might listen once or twice and be a bit amused, but I can't imagine anybody getting this out for actual listening enjoyment. (The religious theme doesn't help.)"
3,wore to my sons wedding,"I have worn ecco sandals for years, but for my sons wedding I wanted something more fancy. I look all over and these were the best for my problem feet.The two strap are thiner and look very nice. One big problem is the strap on the toe kept comming undone."
2,poor value,I had this compressor 2 yrs it worked well for small short term jobs. When I needed it for an all day job (running on & off for 5 hours it burned out...... A real poor value. They are not worth more than $50.00
4,a game with few problems,"Not of played the first call of duty i can not tell you what faults there are in this game that were in the pc verison, but i do know that this is a fun game there a lot of different weapons and it has very fun gameplay. There are different characters you can be in each chapter of the game and three countries you play as but you dont pick which one you play as.There are some hard missions but overall this is a fairly easy game but it is very short. There are some extra features like animations and how they made the chapter. There are cheats to this game but i dont know what they are. So if you are sick of WW2 shooters this might not be the game for you ,although i have never played a WW2 game this good. If you like WW2 you will absoultly want this game. I personaly liked this game but it is too short."
1,Worst game ever,"Don't buy this game. Not even for your worst enemy. Annoying sound track, lame story line and game gliches too numerous to list. What were these people thinking? My copy will be going to the nearest landfill ASAP. I refuse to subject anyone else to this game by selling it."
2,what a drag!,"When Call Of Duty was released last year, it redefined how intense combat could get in a video game. Now, spark studios has released finest hour for the systems. Good right? not entirely. Something was lost in the switching process, oh I don't know, like the whole frickin intensity and action!!!! Now all I feel is my character running around shooting stuff he can barely see because of the fuzzy graphics. The only good thing about this game is that it has an intresting story line and historical backround. Otherwise, stay the heak away from this budget title."
4,"Good, But not as good as comp","Call of Duty is a very good game. I can play it for hours at a time on the comp. The problem is, is that it takes a long time to load on the comp if you have an o.k. computer. I recommend that if you do not have a good internet connection or a good computer to get this.The reason I rate the game a 4 is because the controls are hard to get used to, and you can not play multiplayer with 2 controllers. After playing C.O.D on the comp for 4 months it is hard to get used to using the analog controls and you can not customize your own controls. To play multiplayer you have to go online to play( I don't have a connection to the internet on my PS2). If you want a game that has a good multiplayer play Medal of Honor: The Rising SunAll in all it is a good game but I recommend you rent it."
5,"Great FX, but short","If I could, I'd rate the fun of this game a 6 out of 5. This game is incredible. The graphics are great and the sound is astonishing because of how real it is. The only drawbacks are how short the game is, and lack of multiplayer. The game still takes a while because of the difficulty, but it is not as long as I'd like. I also wish that it had multiplayer other than online, but if you have online capability, than it isn't a problem. Is this game worth $40.00? Definitly. It is the best money I have spent on a game since San Andreas."
4,Space medic!,Fun sci-fi yarns of a space medic traversing the galaxy with his delightful sidekick alien Hippocrates.Fine idealist adventure tales. Hubbard's writing moves very well here and kept me entertained.
1,Horrible.,"This book appears to have been written by a ten-year-old. I feel cheated and insulted by the author and the publisher. The book was clearly published by a VANITY PRESS: a company that is paid by book writters to print and bind the author's book because no actual book publisher would by the text. (The book was printed by ""Bridge Publications,"" which is a vanity press.) This shows you just how badly written the book is: the author himself had to pay to have it made into a book!Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,this toy sucks,I bought this rocket for my son to be a toy to help him move on to bigger better rockets. Plus give him some ideas about science. It did neither. I couldn't even get it to work. It is horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone.It is awful. the directions are lousy and the outcome of the rocket is even worse. It did nothing but sit there. I will never oreder this item again.
5,In the Mood alright,This CD is the best love songs Alabama ever did. If you love Alabama this CD is a must have....10 stars from me!
5,PHOTO SUPERSTAR,"Raw talent that is captured here, for you to enjoy...This man is...eye behind the lense.!"
2,It's already over??!!,"The game is all the description says it is...except it's incredibly short. There are 16 ""adventures"" to get through to win the game...which took me less than 10 hours total. The game, in and of itself, is fun, quirky, and very enjoyable. I just wish I hadn't paid 40 bucks for something with such a short life span; it doesn't seem worth it."
3,Somewhat dissatisfied....,My kids are having fun w/it but it is disappointing that they send a totally different product than the one pictured -- so agree with other reviewers to be prepared for that!!! Not sure why they don't just update the product image so customers know what they are getting!!!
1,Twin-Tested: Miserable Stroller,"It's so bad, I had to buy another stroller! Seats have no padding compared to Graco's single strollers. It steers poorly and requires more room than most stores have for turning. 2 Snug-Rides fit poorly. The straps fall out when shild leans forward. It's much heavier than other doubles, it's awkward to unfold, the canopies provide very little sun protection and make it difficult to access the kids, the canopies are difficult to detach, the angle & size of the basket make it difficult to squeeze in even a small diaper bag. My list of disappointments continues."
3,Blue????,"It was great that we could leave these lights on for the entire holiday season. However, none of us could get used to the blue color of the white lights. I doubt that we will use these in the house next year. I think they may go outside where the blue hue may not be as obvious."
2,Eww! Things were tough in the bad old days...,"There was a time when this was the best book on anime published outside Japan. Sadly, that time was some point in 1992, and before long, the whole thing was blown out of the water by Trish Ledoux and Helen McCarthy in quick succession. Now, a whole decade along, this Italian classic has finally been translated for the American market, but the age shows. So, too, does the low quality of the production -- parts of this book aren't even in English, but in a weird French-Candian-Italian dialect that makes no sense. Very, very out of date, very very incomplete, and completely superceded by the Stone Bridge Anime Encyclopedia just months after its US publication."
5,A must read,"This is another of the few books my brother and I bought to learn to program games. This particular one was for mobile devices. Like all the other programming books, we learned a lot but didn't do much with it after we did. Now we have the knowledge to program mobile games and we haven't done a thing with it. LOL. A great book for anyone wanting to learn mobile phone game programming."
2,Don't Wast Your Money,"This is absolutly the worst programming book i've ever read! Although Michael Morisson shows a lot of techniques and details of MIDP 2.0, he doesn't explain how to use them efficiently and how to integrate them into projects. This is also the way he programs himself. All samples are confuse and against all object-oriented principles. Sure, people learn how to write simple gags, but writing an average game is impossible with this book."
5,THIS IS THE ONE !!!!,"I have had larger compressors, but this little guy keeps up with want ever jobs I have for it. Great Bang For The BuckYou cant beat it ! it's a must."
5,Fantastic performance!!!!! Peace & Adrenalin atmosphere!!!,"This DVD has better production than the previous DVD ""Where You There?"" It`s harmonic!!! beacuse in this Concert the band accompany stringed instruments like violin, chello, in order to create a great atmosphere, some say that Antehema is a half of Pink floyd and half Radiohead, but the truth is that Anathema have a new metal concept which transports you to other worlds, I think is one of the best metal bands nowdays, Great DVD!!!! If You are fan, you must have it, I you r'not, you must give the chance to your ears to enjoy this music."
3,nothing special,"i was expecting more based on other reviews i had read. honestly i found this dvd to be rather dull. i bought it partially because i am a fan of the band's ""judgment"" and ""silent enigma"" albums and partially on a whim. i am glad i watched it to satisfy my curiosity about it. i do not dislike it enough to sell it, but i would have to be really really bored to watch it once more. i am uncertain whether or not the reviews of this dvd i had read were written relative to the band's other dvd(s). in the grand scheme of things, however, i found it drab."
5,Wow! I love this cookbook!,"This is by far the best, most useful cookbook I have! It not only has wonderful recipes like ""Veal Lyonnaise"", ""Herbed Skillet Scallops"", and ""Turnips Au Gratin"", but you will also be able to learn how to do just about anything in the kitchen from this book. It even tells you how to get the sand out of clams before you steam them! It makes a welcome gift for new brides or anyone just starting out on their own. I have had my copy for nearly 15 years, and it is always the first one I pull off the shelf when I'm looking for a recipe or instruction."
3,I like the book but my son found it really out of date,I think my son got something out of the book but he did not enjoy reading it. It could just be that he is 14 and this information is not something he likes to hear. He did find the references in the book old and corny and did a lot of complaining to me while I made him read it. I told him to put it in his book shelf and I hope he will read it again in a couple of years.
5,A great book for teenagers!,"After reading most of this book, I have learned a lot about the adult world and controlling your life. Read this book if you want to learn a lot about living a successful live as an adult!"
1,not relevant,"in an effort to help an asian american high school junior make plans for choosing possible careers and future education, i ordered the book. i found it less than appealing in all aspects, including format. the book is not relevant to 21st century young adults who are trying to deal with an ever-changing world."
1,Don't buy this tv,"Bought the Sony Wega KD-30XS955 in 2005. After first few months, tv would not turn. Light would just blink in stand-by mode. Had to unplug from wall to get it to turn back on. This problem would occur every few weeks. Now the tv no longer receives NTSC signal. Called technical support and after 2 hours on the phone, found them to be completely useless. Took it to get repaired and was told by technician that the problem was MANY bad solder joints and that this was common with Sony. Brought tv home and it still won't receive NTSC. Now I have to lug this thing back to have it repaired again. I bought the Wega based on Consumer Reports ratings. Please, do yourselves a favor, DO NOT buy this tv, or any Sony for that matter. Do some research and you'll find out that many people are having problems with Sony tv's. And don't believe everything you read in Consumer Reports!"
4,Great Trailer,This is a well made solid trailer with the added benefit of being convertable into a carrier or just transported easily without taking up cargo space.It is a better trailer than I expected it to be. I'm very pleased with the purchase and the Amazon price was better than most and shipping was free. The vinyl bearing cups didn't fit well over the grease nipples is my only complaint - not a big deal.
4,"Gilmore puts the ""Western"" back in C & W music","Before country music became all about the Dixie Chicks, Shania Twain and Garth Brooks (quality performers all ... if you think quality and unit sales amount to the same thing), it used to be called Country & Western music.This terrific collection of songs performed with heartfelt honesty and effortless grace by Jimmie Dale Gilmore harkens back to the now-missing second portion of that musical equation. If you like your songs superlative, your arrangements simple and your singers sincere, you're a candidate for being wowed by this throwback artist, whose nasal twang and obvious earnestness just might be able to cure even the most hidebound cynic. ""Ripple"" and the title cut are the best of a stellar bunch."
2,Plain and Simple,"Surprised at the poor quality of Sheldon's writing in this one! Single dimension characters, ridiculous situations - from which they somehow escape over and over again. Shallow story line. No real plot."
4,More Down to Earth,"I like this song especially the lyrics. It seems wholesome and something society as an axiom needs to return to and not the exception. When I first heard this song however I could have swore it was mostly guitar with no back up vocals or piano or drums. This version seems a little too polished and not in the spirit of the ""simple and the plain"" this song seems to be advocating. I'd love to be able to find that original version or have one recorded that is a little more down to earth."
1,a lot of reveiwers dont know what garbage is.,"First off garbage is stuff you throw away, and x-men legends needs to be thrown away. I bought played it for about an hour and then use it to eat hamburger helper off it. I not even going to go into details. If you think this game is fun. Your garbage too!"
3,Great game but.....,"I really like this game but it has some big problems.1)There are parts in the game that player one is the only one able to play, leaving the rest of the party behind2)health is easy to find when the game is easy and VERY hard to find the more you advance.3)Average opponents have five times the hit points you do and sometimes have powers that surpass yours (I.E the ability to stun you and cause massive shock waves)4) You can only hold 15 health packs(split between four players that doesn't add up to much) and if you want to buy them the price is outrageous.5)The missions are long. Usally I don't mind this but when it takes me 2-3 hours to finish one mission that's getting alittle exessive.That doesn't mean that you shouldn't get this game. I'm having a blast, but if you're a Bolder's Gate player and you're expecting the same game but with X-men, you're going to be disappointed"
2,Meh,"I'm not an avid game player, and only pick up the controller once in a blue moon. With this said, I had a very hard time playing this game. I actually haven't made it past the 1st level! I've gotten so frustrated with it that I think I'm going to sell it to someone who will acutally have the time and patience to play it. If you are a very skilled game player then this game is probably for you. Otherwise, I would recommend you look elsewhere for an X-men game."
4,Researching Mr. Right,"I love Wendy Straker's style of writing - so funny and lively and full of good, practical advice. My friends and I are mothers of successful, professional, highly-educated but lonely twenty-something sons and daughters who are looking for mates (or just dates). I say just give 'em the book because they don't listen to us anyway. Maybe she can help."
3,SImilar Product,"I received the package in great time, but when I opened it, it was the 120V 60 Hz type, not the 100-240V 50-60Hz that the picture showed (http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/ciu/5e/bf/5eed81b0c8a02563cc0d9110.L.jpg). The reason I wanted the dual voltage is so that when I go out of country, I can use this adapter without a transformer. The reason I gave it a 3 was because the shipping was quick and I can still use this adapter in the US."
5,Great Seat! Safe Ride!,"I read many reviews and rating, and this is the seat I purchased. It's been great. I purchased it because of it's safely rating and all the extra padding. Comfort I thought ... and it seems to be, but I didn't think about the summer heat. My son often has a wet back and a ring where his head rests on hot summer days ... even with the air on in the car. I didn't use the boot cover and the canopy is a hassle. We removed it. The covering material washes well."
5,"Easy to Install, Very Safe","I love this carseat. It was super easy to install with the latch system and is very, very safe. Once the base is installed, it's very simple to pop the seat in and out of your car. I have a base in my car and my husband bought an extra base (only about $35) for his car. That way, we can easily switch cars without having to install the base every single time. It took us a total of maybe 30 minutes to set up and install everything. I highly recommend!"
2,Why do they do this,Why oh why do they do this...They take a great movie cut it down to 1:33 FULL SCREEN and package it..The art of cutting down the movie to fit a standard TV is getting old..I love the animated series and have the complete collection...Hopefully I will be able to get this in an un butchered format...
3,100 Ways to get your kids moving........,"With summer vacation is nearing many parents are probably searching for activities that do not involve computers,or the television. Kids will be motivated to sing, dance, and come up with game of their own, or if too young with an adults help.Little ones will love these three discs, of their own music without limations."
4,Good original Southern style rock n roll!,"Podunk has a sound of their own. Definitely very talented, honest, and original. I purchased this CD for the song Dashboard Mary. For anyone that likes southern style rock with a twist of Austin. Also a very positive message."
1,"""Upgrade Edition"" = BIG BIG MISTAKE","You spent hours installing all your applications and customizing your setup. One day your computer crashes and you can't restart it. What happens next?With XP: You pull out your installation disk and do a repair installation. 3/4 hour later, you are functioning again.With Vista ""upgrade edition"": You're screwed. You need to reinstall XP. Then upgrade it again. Then reinstall all your applications and customizations. Plan on spending all weekend."
2,Another windows ME.,Unstable OS. Digital rights managment software built in so until we ( Computer users) disect this OS and remove the garbage I dont recommend buying till there are mods and patches available for it.
1,Very unimmaginative,"I am both a Windows and Mac user.And personally, when i installed Windows Vista on my laptop, it looked the exact copy of Mac OS X in terms of graphics...everyone is hyped about the ""3D scrolling of windows"" on the desktop ... but actually, there has been the same thing on mac for about 2 years now ...just press F9 ...also the widgets? cmon, could they have put a little bit of immagination and created something new and original? they even put the brick puzzle that's on mac!"
3,Not happy with Vista so far,"So far, Vista does not thrill me, however it could be that I'm not used to it yet so I will be patient and see how it goes."
1,Typical Microsoft Trash;,"With a fast computer one would think that the newest addition of the MicroScam work would perform relatively quickly... but the thinking ends there. Between HORRENDOUS game load times, SEVERE stability issues, and lots of ""NEATO"" features to cover up all of the garbage, it still smells like crap under the carpet. I have a new, fast, and sharp PC, and yes, with all the latest drivers, to absolutely no avail. I'll be joining the ranks of those of us that will be reformatting/reinstalling XP. Maybe in three years they'll have this running the way it should be and I'll waste more of my life calling these renobs to get a new key for the new hardware I'll certainly be running by then. Thanks for the huge pile Microsoft!"
2,How many years for a knock off of Mac OS,"First off Ultimate is way to expensive i paid an extra $100 for a extra security feature, a texas holdem game and the video wallpaper. I still think the Mac OS is better looking and other than better a looking xp and a very good and fast search I dont know what other positives i can say about it. If ur computer and programs are not vista ready i suggest u hold off. Also vista needs more than the minimum to run at a decent speed the start up and shut down are very slow. I have a 06 vaio that wasnt vista ready and a month later im still looking for drivers and software i lost. So if u have to have the newest and best out there ur mind is made up like mine was ur going to buy it. It takes some time getting used to but I learnd to like it. If your not sure about buying wait, its not worth the money it cost yet. XP is just fine for now."
3,Windows Vistas Ultimate,"As I keep hearing, Windows Vista Ultimate is a work in progress. Windows XP Professional is much cleaner and faster. I suppose if you have completely updated the maximum computer components (RAM & Video Card) it obviously should run much more smoothly. I have never had so many glitches and general ""bugginess"" in any previous Microsoft product. I recommend buying Vista if you ""really"" think you need it along with waiting until the first service pack release."
3,Not quite ready for prime time.,"Eventually I think this will be a major improvement over Windows XP. However, there should have been much more coordination between Microsoft and the vendors of third-party software. When I first installed Vista I had considerable problems with applications that I feel are essential on my machine.With the exception of QuickBooks by Intuit, most of the vendors have now issued patches or low-cost updates to their software so it will run on Vista."
4,Water & Bridges,This is not the best CD Kenny has put out but the type of songs that are on it he did the best he could do. I will listen to it every once in awhile. I think my score is generous on this one. Thanks OVB
4,Just too high,"I think I'm going to have to resell these on ebay. They are just too high for my foot, especially for a casual shoe. They are pretty, but not as comfy as I'd hoped. Width and length was fine."
4,Not very reliable,My sister bought this for my son's birthday. He had it for two months before it died. He was very upset. My mom is sending him a new one for Christmas. I'm sure that one will die too.
5,Hatching Magic,"This book gave me a look at magic in a completely different way than before. Hatching magic is a wonderful book that it is hard not to read it over again when you're done.If you love the mysteries and wonder of magic you'll love this book. The setting is mainly in present day Boston, but begins in the 15th century with a wizard, Gideon. Gideon's dragon, Wycca, goes through a bolt hole into the present day Boston, in search of a place to lay her egg. Follow Gideon on a magical adventure to find his dragon, and her baby, before his enemy does, and turns his beloved Wycca against him. With a little help from a dragon-loving girl,Theodora, the books different characters bring the story to an end. This book has a wonderful ending in a battle between good and evil with a little catch about a magical deck of cards."
2,Not so good.....,"I am a really big fan of Lemony Snicket so when I saw that the game was 30 bucks, I immediately bought it and played it when I went home. I was very dissapointed since I beat the game in like five hours! It is very short and the replay value isn't that good. One part that is actually good is that you can build the machines, but, no offense, but they have kind of ghetto names. I mean seriously! The Levitating Loafers? The Baby Booster? Sure it kind of sounds cool when you first hear it but seriously! If you just got a Gamecube, this could be a good game to practice on, but if you've been playing a Gamecube for a LONG time, then I suggest you skip this game like I wish I had."
1,not worth the money,"If you think you can hold a compact set of binoculars with 30X magnification still enough to be of any value - you are wrong. Buy a fixed magnification pair of 7, 8 or 10 X and be happy. If you need more magnification, go to a full sized pair for greater image stability. Quality was poor. The plastic seemed cheap. The zoom was not smooth at all. I bought them and immediately returned them. I was very disappointed beacuse I am a loyal Olympus customer for compact 35 mm cameras and digital cameras. Thought the quality would carry over. I was wrong."
1,not the bargen i thought,"the add does not show the optional spline or sds drive shankes needed for this tool the're expensive! now i have to weld a broken spline shank i saved ,not everyone can do this.i,m not happy i suggest you change the add"
3,Whoops forgot one last thing...,"...I did forget something that I noticed in one of the other reviews...I totally agree about Gregori's reaction to finding out a brother and sister were alive after not knowing for hundred's of years...he had I think 2 sentences to say, neither of which was ""I'll be right there"" or ""Hot damn! I'm on the next plane"" or ""I'm sooo vaklampt...talk amongst yourselves""...come on now...One scene where he came by to say ""Hi I'm your big bro...nice to meet ya gotta go, busy with the young missus...ya'll take care now here?"" wouldn't have been too much trouble now would it? Like I stated early of the Dark series which are all in the 5 and 4 star category, this book was really a 2...maybe a 1.5, but I gave it the 3 'cause of Darius...hope he lives up to the build up."
4,dark challenge,I have bought a great deal a books from amazon and i have been pleased to know that if i can not find the book i am looking for i know amazon will have it. I only buy from amazon know because when i look for something this is the only place that has it.
1,"Good, But . . .","The good: great design, beautiful, keeps perfect timeThe bad: not water resistant--wore it swimming (no diving) and the crystal is fogged. Am afraid it's ""toast."" Hopefully Amazon or Wenger will replace it under the warranty."
5,Closer to God,Jars is an annointed band with great musical skills. God has blessed them wonderfully. A great accompaniement to this CD is the 11th hour DVD which is the concert that you can view. You will appreciate the stage presence of a band that uses the gospel to heighten awareness of listeners to the Grace and Sacrifce of Jesus. I am a new fan and praise the Lord for their songs. Go to letssingit.com and get the lryics for these songs. To read them is tremendously helpfull to knowing what points the band is trying to convey. Enjoy
5,Best Christian CD,"I love that this comes with 2 CD's; one live and one in studio.I play the in studio CD over and over again in my car. It's really great worship music, then if you want to rock out there's the live CD too."
4,Not what you might expect...,"This CD masquerades under the title ""World Service"" but is NOT a digitized version of the original vinyl. For the most part, it seems to be out-takes and demos, perhaps working versions of the songs recorded for the ""World Service"" LP release. The versions presented here are spare, and demonstrate the depth of Moore's writing and arranging talent without the gloss of the LP's excellent production. Very interesting and enjoyable, but what happened to the masters of the vinyl release? I'd like to have the original in digital format as well...The rocked up version of ""Lucia"" is great, and there are a couple of renditions of ""Out of Angels"" that are both very listenable, but neither have the atmosphere of the vinyl release.A good addition to the collection that expands the scope of an under-recognized writer, producer, and performer. Now let's find the original masters!"
4,sounds good,"although i haven't rad this book, yet it seems like one which you can have fun with because of it's characters yt you can get the moral of the story as well. you can also see a different perspective of how people think. i have heard many good things about this book and anyone who has time for a ""fun/learned"" read, shouls give this a try"
4,aww,Gotta love you're classic Disney :)I know I do. Gotta say I'm really glad these keep coming out as I'd hate to have to keep those bulky VHS tapes.
4,High End Learning,The book is very well structured and is aimed at a level where the details of linguistics are fairly well understood. It is not a book from which you could learn how to converse in Hungarian but details how the sentences and syntax form and vary to elicit subtleties and variations of the language. Probably aimed at a level where the user is already capable of speaking and understanding Hungarian to an average degree.
3,Christmas in South Africa,"Not as good as some of the earlier Gaither concerts - it is not a video that you can watch time and time again as it is pretty depressing.It is more of an educational statement on AIDS and children in South Africa, than Christmas Music for the season."
3,Great as far as it goes,"This CD would be much better if it included some of the main instrumental themes including ""Wednesday's Child"" originally the theme for Quiller Memorandum and ""Experiment in Terror"" from the film of the same name."
2,Good but has room for more information.....,"The DVD is a bit expensive for it's contents. Despite of all the good reviews, never once in the entire DVD did he explain how to trim the dogs legs. He only demonstrates how to trim the bottom of the paws. Needless to say, if you are like me that owns a dog with long hair or wants to do a kind of style cut on your dogs legs like the round ball cut on a puddle's lower leg or any other type of style you will be clueless."
3,Doggie Cuts,"This video is great for people with dogs who have standard cuts especially for show dogs. It is detailed and step by step in its explanation. And it is chock full of ideas.There are two basic assumptions that didn't work for me. One that all dogs will have their standard breed cuts - no puppy cuts for usually long haired dogs are even alluded to.The second is that all dogs are comfortable with grooming. Very little is mentioned about readying a dog to stand for long periods of time.Also, I tried this on our Havanese puppy before her adult hair was grown in and it was a challenge just using the clippers on this fine little fluff. When dogs can be groomed should be mentioned too."
4,Helpful,"I thought this dvd was a big help as far as seeing what the featured groomed dogs are supposed to look like afterward. Two things bothered me: 1)the dogs were TOO well behaved and that's not realistic. And 2) it really bothered me when the groomer wiped his nose after grooming the back end of a dog. Ewwww.All the same, this dvd was worth the money to me."
4,Every Gay Man Must Own This!,"Yes, it is a travesty. But it is an obscure classic of the Disco era belted out by the Queen of show tunes! You'll laugh yourself into hysterics the first time you hear it, and your friends won't believe it's for real. I know - I have one of the very few original copies released on vinyl 25 years ago, and it's a collectors' item. Every time I have played it for friends, it has paid for itself ten times over. Even if you weren't dancing in the disco era, if you love the Merm, Show Tunes and dance music, you and your friends will love this CD."
1,'Wanna know what really killed disco?,"Then, listen to just ONE cut on this laughable (and, somewhat sad) release by one of Broadway's greats."
5,A Must Have,"This video gets in depth with Jim Garrison, and it tells of his investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy. This is a perfect companion to ""On the Trail of the Assassins"" as it takes you into the whole case, and interviews all the primary figures involved with the investigation. Highly recommended!"
3,only liked half of the book,i only liked the chapters involving nikki and mitchell. there story was a fresh take on newlyweds with baby moma drama. i started skipping the oj chapters half way through the book. oj just got on my nerves. i was tried of reading about playa days and his love story with the author was predictiable.
5,Hilarious!,"Augusten pulled it off again! this book is great! The coolest thing is how it's like a messed up QVC,HSN etc. WHo knows what goes on behind the scenes?"
2,This book has no soul (and needs a new editor),"Sellevision is by far the least enjoyable Burroughs book I've read so far. Although the premise is quite interesting, the execution falls flat on its face. I didn't become invested in any of the characters and couldn't care less what happened to them. The storyline never fully captured my interest and I was basically reading the book just to finish it, not to find out what happened next.However, what annoyed me the most is that the book is rife with misspelled words. One that springs to mind is ""trillian"", which was correctly spelled ""trillion"" later in the book. I find it hard to believe that a book by a best-selling author can be published and sold with so many spelling errors (especially when I paid $13 for it).Sellevision was a huge disappointment."
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"this cd really sucks, i havnt even heard it. but theres a good reason for that, and i think you all know why. my first problem with this cd is; its a soundtrack... who the hell buys a soundtrack. what are you? some kind of jerk? second of all; the only song even worth hearing on this cd is boy sets fire... and just buy their cd. what is wrong with you... you're looking at reviews to buy a soundtrack album... what are you thinking? serioulsy... you know this cd isnt cool. i dont care how many of your little sisters friends like the new nickelback video... if your even concidering paying money it should be only so that you can buy it, and then thow it in the garbage in on the way out, and everyone will be like ""he just payed for that"" but it will be funny, because it sucks so much. its sintastic. case closed."
4,Evanescence and Chevelle...my two favorite bands ^_^,"Not to say that the others aren't great; they are. This isn't Chevelle's best song, though. It was written for this soundtrack. I suggest getting one of their CDs to actually get to know them. As for Evanescence, what can I say? This is when they were great. (Unfortunately, they're not so great now.) Drowning Pool and Rob Zombie is a great pair, not as good as when Dave was singing for DP (RIP, man) but still makes for a decent song. And of course, you have a bunch of other sick bands, too.Overall, it's an album worth getting."
3,Not complete,"I am dissapointed in the coverage of the subjects and depth of those that arecovered. Book even does not provide a decent heart sounds. Time to time coverage becomes very technical in terms of Electrical Enfginnering, that is fine it is not very difficult but meanwhile other subjects are covered superfluously.I will be looking for other books to read.It is not fair to compare this book with specialized ""The Heart"" books but I think any decent Physiology/Pathophysiology book covers as much as even more than this book."
2,Help!,"Will someone please help me? I am traveling to britain next year and all i want to do is read a nice, charming, pleasant travel book about the country, and I can't even do that! So far i have read Bill Bryson's book and this one, and all that these guys do is trudge around the country grumbling about how ugly the towns are or how depressing the people are! I would really like to read a travel book about someone who took a stroll around green, pleasant little Britain, saw the sights, talked to the people, and made it home in time for tea. Call me weak, but i just cannott stomach these downer books. If anyone can suggest something a bit happier, please, let me know!"
1,Don't buy the hype.,This dvd like All Carlton Sheets courses are just fluff. you're just giving him money; for nothing.
5,One of the best Recording of the genre ever done before,"This is an historic recording where the highest level of brass playing can be heard. Indeed, it is a reference for those professional and students who want an insight of style and performance practicing of how Hindemith's works should be Played. The balance between soloists and accompainment is perfect. There is another recording with the same contents,that should be checked out for pedagogical porpouses. The album (sony records) was performed by the members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Gleen Gould piano."
2,no cassette,"Book is good , but received no cassette, if there to cassette they shouldn't list it! The book is OK but with out cassette it loses it purpose."
1,ultimate vista $400,"a. all peripherals are not recognized by vista(printers/keyboard/mouse/cameras/sound card/external memory/USBs/ISP/etc.)!b. all programs and files are not recognized by vista!c. although i paid $400 for vista and it is installed, i cannot use it!"
1,Bad Vista,Vista is only a bloated piece of software. I recommend you to just stick to XP or upgrade to OS X.
5,Requirements,"If you plan to upgrade or do a fresh install of Windows Vista, make sure you have a very decent processor (at least 2 ghz), at least 2 gb of RAM, and at least a 128 mb dedicated video card or your gonna have a slow time. If you plan on gaming plan on needing 4 gb of ram. Vista is a memory hog. But it will be a very nice operating system with tens of thousands of drivers. We have it on a few computers at my job and it is pretty cool."
1,Horrible OS,I regret every minute I use this OS.It is a resource hog and an immature operating system. There is too much visual 'fluff' and not enough utility to the OS.Looks like I'm going back to XP
5,Something Different!,"The album is terrific. These guys recorded it in their basement from what I've heard. I am a musician and have done much recording myself, but I'd never be able to tell this wasn't done in a pro studio! The songs show a nice variety. Everything from space rock to a little swing. I've had the privilage of seeing SEekingDawn live and they put on a great show. All I can say is to imagine Pink Floyd meets Nirvana with the kookiness of Queen! Keep on rockin'!"
2,ok book light,not sure why. i like this light a lot; but a have had a few and none seem to last very long. always have bulb problems.
5,All about the Message,Let's not get so caught up in who should or shouldn't have been featured in this collection. It's ALL about God's message being spread through music. It's the message that we need NOT the artist.God bless us ALL.
3,no different from the PS2 version,I wanted to buy the xbox version of this game for years. I played this game already on the PS2 good game I was hoping for difference in quality between the xbox and the PS2 version. I was hoping for smooth motion quality like the previous harry potter xbox games but this one has the same motion quality as the PS2 version but I'm happy I at least got this because my PS2 version is scratched really badly so I'm happy I at least got this
1,quick failure,"This product failed within the first two weeks. I called OTC and they said they would send out a replacement right away, I hope to have better luck with that one."
2,My g-g-g-g-grandfather,William Bloyd is my gggggrandfather and I learned my ancestors settle in Tigard Oregon by the Oregon trail. Their travels were record in the book along with wills and letters.
5,Ana's Best Album,This is the best of the best of Ana Belén. A must!!!! A very very good compilation and a best seller in Spain!
3,"Promete, pero se queda corto","Este disco promete, de veras, pero se queda corto. Su momento mas interesante ocurre en la segunda cancion. Pero lo demas, aunque produce algo de disfrute, no emociona. No hay riesgos. Bajo la apariencia de desorden, todo sonido en este disco esta milimetricamente medido, que en principio no esta mal, pero no se, no provoca esa emocion que produce un album excelente. Espero que en su proximo disco -si no lo han hecho aun, este disco que reseno es del ano de 1999- me convenzan de que debo comprarlo."
5,IN MY MEMORY,MELANIE was so beautiful and she has great voice!this song with great video is to remember her...
4,"If you suffer from depression, read this.","This book is a very sincere and honest account of every day life with depression. She had everything going for her but couldn't enjoy any of it. She didn't even know she suffered from depression. Like so many of us, she just kept slogging along for years living on determination with little joy. I found the story inspiring and uplifting. I also enjoyed her account of her session with a psychic. Having never been to one, I had no idea what it would be like."
2,Sending it back.,"Unit I received I sent back. Don't know if it was just my unit, or the product line in general, but I'm not getting a second to find out. The non-adjustable screen contrast made reading the small print on the touch-screen buttons very difficult. I have many smaller vendor A/V components that did not appear on the code sheet for remotes, so I had to use the remote learning. Although the remote learning part was easy, despite ""success"" messages during training, it seemed to be hit and miss (more miss than hit) when you then actually tried to use the remote on the equipment. Repetitive training didn't resolve the issue. I also experienced a lot of system freezes when switching into the programming mode - requiring a reset. Despite the internal non-volatile memory, resets always threw off the date / time of the unit and I had to reset that. There were so many nice features to this unit, I am really sorry I just hated mine."
4,Really Good,"I was reading this book and my dad asked me if it was another Harry Potter spinnoff. It's not. The main reason is that this book was written WAY before Harry Potter. Many people might think this book is alot like Harry Potter because it's about a) a school b) of magic. But there the similarities end.This book tells the story of fourteen-year-old Randal, once a squire at his uncle's castle. A wandering magician works tricks of light to earn a night in safety. Randal decides he wants to become a magician like Madoc and trains at the Schola Sorcerae. This is the story of his time as an apprentice and his friends, enemies, studies, magic, and a major battle that will decide the fortunes of all"
4,this cd was nice,this was by far the best cd ive ever since this cd has nice songs. so if you like rap music you will love this cd.
3,Murder Inc,"I picked up this CD today. Its alrite, nothin brilliant though. If you like Murder Inc then you might wanna pick it up. Its got Gotti and Rule and all the others. There is too many on it if you know what i mean, it kinda ruins the songs."
4,Wouldn't leave home without it,"I started taking vitamin B2 as a means of controlling my migraines and I was amazed by the results. Although there are certain side effects to taking a vitamin also used as a yellow dye in many instance (none are worth a worry, I assure you), I've had a great experience using this item. The capsules are easy to swallow, and the containers come in fairly good quantities. Sometimes there might be a capsule that spilled inside the container, however, and you might want to make sure you don't place the pills on a white garment or else it could end up stained."
4,A neat book,"A neat book for a photography buff, fan of Feininger, or an interest in Chicago. great photographs; too bad its only 63 pages."
1,NOT VERY GOOD,"THE MOVIE ITSELF WAS OK... BUT I WANTED SOME OF THE SONGS THAT WAS IN THE MOVIE...THE ONE WHEN SHE WAS RUSHING TO SEE WHAT THE EMERGENCY WAS...."" IM COMING HOME"" I THINK THAT WAS THE NAME OF IT............ IF ANYONE KNOWS THE NAME OF THAT SONG AND WHO THE ARTIST IS PLEASE EMAIL ME.......GREG LASSITERwww.misguidedproduction.com"
1,Where's the soundtrack?,"I was about to purchase a soundtrack from this movie, but after reading the reviews, I have just ""saved"" it to purchase another day. I hope that the production company will put out a true soundtrack. I loved the songs!"
1,this is Not the soundtrack from the movie,I was really disappointed to find out this was not the music from the soundtrack! Maybe if enough people complain we will get the real soundtrack.
3,"Research, people!","You can get the ""real"" soundtrack from the movie's website, but it involves choosing your own list of 10 or so songs and burning your own CD. And it's not free."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first of her books I have read, and most likely the last. The characters aren't well developed (Sara is supposed to be a strong woman but acts like a complete wimp and just sexually obsessed by Jeffrey!)... do people in a little town in the boondocks really carry on like this?? Even te siege episodes weren't that gripping...and why is Lena, another supposedly strong woman putting up with that creep Ethan?"
2,Confusing and annoying flashbacks made this hard to follow; gross.,"I had liked Blindsighted by Karin Slaughter so I thought I'd try this Sara Linton/Jeffrey Tolliver book. I found the jumping back and forth from the past to the present simply annoying. I found the characters in the flashbacks quite frankly unbelievable, implausible. Jeff's mother saying ""I can smell him on your (rude name for female body part) from here"", and a double murder and gay sex scandal in the flashback, plus a lot of rape and references to rape and mutilation during the current time, make this book a bit gross - they seem to be gratuitous additions that don't really add to the story. And except for Sara, the characters in the main timeframe of the book are not appealing either. I think this is enough of Karin Slaughter for me."
2,My least favorite Karin Slaughter book,"I have read several Karin Slaughter books and generally I look forward to the next one although there have been disappointments in some of them.I wait until I finish a book before reading the Amazon customer reviews. I was surprised to find just one, one-star review of this book and the others were five star. I tend to agree with the one-star reviewer.After reading the first 150 pages of this book I decided not to waste any more time reading it since I was not enjoying it. I skimmed through the remaining pages but the book did not seem interesting enough to continue.I know that fiction is fiction, but let's get realistic. What are the chances that two 20-something kids could enter a police station and shoot several people in different rooms without being fired on themselves? And I disliked the flashback technique of re-living the past for most of the book.This book was a big disappointment."
3,She let her readers down,"I so enjoyed Slaughter's Grant County books, becoming attached to Jeff and Sara. For some bizarre reason Slaughter felt she had to kill off Jeffrey so she could create a new story line for Sara.Robert Parker was once asked if he would ever kill off Spenser. His reply was that he would never let down his readers by doing such a thing. Slaughter could have taken his advice."
2,NO!!!,"I found WAY too many questions that were unanswered at the end of this one!!! I HATE THAT!!!Why would an author keep a minor character's story keep going and going and going? Personally, I'm not going to spend the money again to find out. You know the saying, fool me once...It's a shame too, because I like this author's syle of writing."
3,so-so book,"Indelible starts off with a bang as a group of armed men storm a police station, kill a couple of people and take hostages. Instead of a story that is a seige and negotiation, much of the story is told in the form of flashback in a trip back home for Chief of Police Jeffrey Toliver and his ex-wife Sara as he introduced her to his family and the people he grew up with. The initial flashbacks were jarring becuase they completely removed the reader from the action. The flashback uncovered a sordid tale of statutory rape, homosexuality, suicide and murder. in the end, there are very few redeemable characters left in the novel. On the positive side, the long flashbacks directly relate to what is happening in the present, but also rob it of mystery and drama. What's left is a solid read, but nothing spectacular.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
5,Great Flavor,Tastes just like it was made this morning! Amazing on everything from crumpets to baked potatoes. It has lasted in the fridge longer than the recommended time. Buy it----you won't be disappointed!
2,Very disappointing,"It feels as though she has lost her energy, she has become a distant memory of what she used to be with Mecano. Still a sweet voice, the songs chosen for this CD are mediocre. Her first solo CD was good, this was is not. The music just doesn't click, the art in the sleeve doesn't click either, maybe she needs new composers, a different producer. The Pink Floyd track is regrettable, she should not sing in English, she can sing in Spanish and French but I would suggest her to refrain from doing it in English. Maybe the Cano brothers should compose her new material, maybe Mecano should make a comeback...."
2,"Interesting, but not interesting enough. . .","When I listen to this CD, I space out. After awhile, one track sounds like the next, i.e., there's no variety, energy, or passion in ANA TOROJA's voice. Her CD is like music that's playing in an elevator. You hear it, but you don't pay any attention.For me, there's nothing memorable on this CD except for ANA'S singing in English ""I Wish You Were Here."" It was a mistake for her to sing in English. I could barely understand what she was singing.I regret buying this CD. For solo female Latina singers, I would recommend ROSANA or SORAYA."
1,the pbs movie was much better,"i don't know what this was. it certainly was not anything like the original movie or the the book that it was supposedly based on. the aliens were an important part of the book and yet do not exist in this version. the character of heather does not match how she is portrayed in the book. it seems as if the names and title were borrowed from leguin's book but very little of the plot or substance. If you are a true fan of the book, buy the pbs version instead of this one."
1,Don't waste your time,"This has got to be the worst remake I have yet to see! If A & E was too concerned with being politically correct to do this correctly, they should have left this alone. As it is they produced a senseless watered down version that made no since because they ignore the fact that it all is a dream world created by George Orr. Where are the aliens, the plague, gray people, etc. While I like both Lisa Bonet & Lukas Haas, neither was suited for this movie. If you want to see this produced correctly rent the original that is finally available after 20 years of petty arguing between the writers and PBS or better yet read the book."
1,Did Anyone Involved with this Movie Read the Book?,"If you want to see a movie about a strange man having a love affair with his lawyer while his Evil doctor attempts to have him locked up, this is the story for you....There is nothing good about this A&E; version, except perhaps the fact that it ends."
1,For once I couldn't agree more!,"Everyone seems to be in agreement on this title. The PBS version was much, much better and truer to the book. I saw the PBS version as a kid and was impressed with it even then, so much so that as soon as it was available for purchase on DVD this year I bought it. The new version is wooden and left me wondering why the story line had been changed so much. Don't waste you time or money. Purchase the PBS version instead because you won't be disappointed with it."
3,Lathe of Heaven,"I'm not familiar with the novel nor have I seen the earlier adaptation and so I had no preconceived expectations for this movie. Granted, since it's an A&E production, I wasn't expecting it to be first rate, and it certainly isn't. In terms of production quality, the movie is quite good. The story, on the other hand, although an interesting concept, really was somewhat dry and predictable. The dialogue was kind of lame at times, too. In the end I can't say that it's that bad of a movie, but it's certainly not a movie that I'd recommend going out of your way to watch."
1,Audio version is a disaster,"It seems all the reviewers exposed to the audio version had the same reaction I did. Mr. Roker self-narrates with only occasional hints of embarrassment all the banal details of getting to be a father, leaving absolutely nothing out. I tried to hang on until he actually gets into the kind of parenting situations alluded to by the title and cover photograph, but I just couldn't make it. One-third the way into the presentation, The baby's still not even born, and he and his wife are deciding how to decorate the nursery (they ultimately chose to sponge-paint the walls). That's where I bailed, feeling ashamed with myself for sticking with it for as long as I did. I've never felt so abused by an audio book in my life."
1,Al Roker: Don't Make Me Stop This Car,"Sorry to disagree with the other reviews, but this is undoubtedly the most boring book I have ever read. No offense to Mr. Roker...I really like the guy, so I'm especially disappointed. I heard him on the radio promoting the book, and he was a riot. So what happened? We've all been cornered by the well-meaning, but incredibly self-absorbed young couple that wants to tell us, blow by blow, every detail of their pregnancy and delivery. Well, that's exactly what this book does to you...Corners you, bores you, and finally lets you go, with regret that you wasted so much money on the book. Sorry gang, but this book was excruciating."
1,It ain't worth it!!!,First of all this is not a KIT as specified on the box. It is the rock tumbler ONLY. The drums are pathetic. The lids are held on with large 'O' rings and have a tendancy to pop off when tumbling causing the drums to leak. The lid will eventually pop out if not caught in time. My so called kit came in with one of the 'O' rings broken so I had to wait until a new one was delivered before I could use. I would not recoomend this to any one. It is definitely not worth what it cost. What a waste of money...
3,Not the size ordered,"I bought this pan for my mother who makes her meatloaves in wide, shallow pans. The 14 X 10 X 3 dimensions were perfect. What was delivered was totally different. Its size was 11 X 5 3/4 X 2 3/4 overall size (not interior). We will keep and use the pan, but it is absolutely no good for making meatloaf for the big family gatherings that we often have."
5,Excellent Product!!,Excellent product! Inner pan does sit slightly off bottom of outer pan. Cooked perfect and clean up was a snap. Highly Recommend this product!
2,it steams,The drain insert does not have enough holes in it. The meat loaf never forms a crust beacause the meat is just steaming while it is in the oven. I tried pushing the loaf away from the edges but that didn't help.
1,Horrible Graphics,The graphics were Horrible for this game. I have an excellent sound card and graphics card and it still (stunk). I wouldn't recommened this game to anyone...Do not buy it. Other wise it was good.
1,Waste of Money...,"This game is so buggy. I tried to install this on 4 different machines, with different hardware and OSes. Not 1 was successful. The publisher won't even respond to my tech support e-mails and phone calls."
5,Everyone's a Winner with This Game!,I have played this game in large groups and small groups. The large groups will consist of 8 people and the smallest is 2. When I have played a one on one game with a friend I leave with more knowledge about the individual than I went into the game with in large groups I feel more comfortable with each individual on a different level and usually I hear people say where can I get this game. I smile and kindly say just about anywhere.
4,Almost but not as good,"I have been very happy with the first four seasons of the show on DVD. The only thing that I don't like about this season is the fact that it is in widescreen. I hate widescreen, especially on a t.v. show. I can handle it a little better if it were a movie. It is kind of painful to watch. That is a shame since it is a great show. I hope that season six comes in standard format like it is shown in television."
1,Small isn't always best,"I thought this was a good multi-tool, until it was time to use it. I had to adjust my seatpost on a century ride and it took three tries before I was finally able to get the bolt tight enough to stop it from slipping. The thing was just too tiny to provide enough leverage. I was being forceful with it too; if I didn't have cycling gloves on I don't think I'd have been able to get it tight enough.I almost lost it once when it fell out of my tool roll. That's my own fault for not packing things well, but again a normal sized tool wouldn't have been small enough to slip out. I'm shopping for a new tool, I'll take a few extra grams for something that won't let me down."
2,Does not seem work much,I bought Vitex because it is one of herb medicines that claims help treat PMS. I decide give it a try and hope it works. But I did not feel much different at all at first few months. I keep taken it but still does not do the trick. The symptom remain same entire time and even after I stop taken it. So Vitex does nothing for my PMS.
1,CAUTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had a miscarriage in February. No EWCM and after period suffered from vaginal dryness. After only taking this for 2 weeks I once again have EWCM and am excited about trying for another baby! This product increased my CM all together.HOWEVER, I did experience heart palpatations the first weeK BAD ENOUGH TO GO TO THE E.R. my periods are REGULAR and I ovulated REGULARLY PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT IF YOUR CYCLE AND OVULATIONS ARE REGULAR. I HAD TO STOP THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE I WAS DOING OVER THE COUNTER OVULATION TEST AND WASNT EVEN REGISTERING, I'VE BEEN OFF OF IT FOR 2-3 DAYS AND TODAY I'VE STARTED REGISTERING ON THE OPK'S THIS CYCLE. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE."
1,Caused Heart Palpitations,"I can say with 100% certainty this product gave me heart palpitations. They started not long after I introduced this product into my daily vitamin regimen. I took it for 12 days and each day the palpitations got longer and more severe. I didn't make the connection at first as I thought it was hormonal. Finally after realizing it couldn't have been hormonal and thinking about what was new in my diet, all arrows pointed to Vitex. I stopped taking it and within 24 hours the palpitations decreased significantly. Within 72 hours they were gone and have not come back. I will say my body is very sensitive so this doesn't come as a huge surprise. I hope this helps anyone that has experienced the same symptoms while on Vitex."
1,Don't Buy This Book,"As a pubished author, I hesitated writing a negative review of this book. I know the amount of time it takes to put a book together and I wanted to be respectful of a fellow author.I won't blame the author solely for the final product. Her editor should have advised her on how to make this book stand behind the title - Syndication Secrets.There are no secrets in this book. In fact, a quick Google search and one can find out the information contained in the book. The information she provided is so readily available that they are hardly secret and don't fall under the category ""What No One Will Tell You."""
4,Keep your attention,I thought the book was good. Although I was surprised the attraction between Jasmine and Sandman was revealed and played out so soon in the book. Entertaining.
4,Enchanting,"The Heap is the story of street children who have started a society for themselves in a landfill. The children have been shut out from the world so they start their own society. They survive on being equals and looking out for each other. It starts to go wrong when they find something that the outside adult world doesn't want them to own.The author never tells you where the story is located, that I can remember, but things in it make you believe it takes place somewhere in South America. The narrator is a former priest who has lost his way a little and comes across this society. If you enjoy magical realism then you might really enjoy this book."
4,Challenging Mind and Heart,"This is a great book that will challenge your mind and heart. You will not only find that it keeps your interest and gives you pictorial descriptions, but it will make you consider what is in your heart."
5,Relationships,"This brought home the true meaning of Christianity, Relationship. As we strive to be good enough we fail to see the relationships around us and how those relationships effect our relationship with God."
5,Fantastic!! Very inspirational and practical.,"This book is excellent reading for anyone who is experiencing a setback or difficult circumstances. Always positive and uplifting, the book encourages you to see every situation as an opportunity for positive change and growth. Perseverance is a constant theme in the book as well. It's practical, funny, poignant, and right on time!"
5,High Priests of Brass,"The American Brass Quintet is truly the greatest ensemble the world has to offer. No other group can compete with the beautiful tone and lucidity of phrasing the ABQ continually presents. New American Brass is one of the ABQ's definative albums. With a vitality second only to hearing them perform live, New American Brass gives the listener a breathtaking panoramic view of the best contemporary brass chamber music. At the forefront of this album's selections is Eric Ewazen's Colchester Fantasy Suite, a living masterpiece that immidiately sweeps you into its current, and flows naturally into glistening rivulet of the main theme.The caliber of the American Brass Quintet cannot be matched by any other brass quintet."
1,"Sorry, Weenie!","My children and I watch Oswald almost every day, so I was eager to pick up the CD when I saw it at the store. I was shocked at how short it was- only 17 minutes from start to finish. I had expected more songs, or at least extended versions of the songs selected. Many of my favorites were not on the CD (""I Can't Rollerskate"" and ""Go, Go-cart, Go,"" to name a few). Almost a third of the CD is instrumental (not high on my two kids' playlist). I expected more from my beloved round friend."
1,"Danger Will Robinson, Danger","I read these reviews too late. I bought the product and used it. The fact that it didn't pop all the kernels is not the issue for me. I believe (my opinion only) the unit to be a safety hazard from the kernels being thrown in all directions including the floor. I actually had kernels popping behind me and suffered burned fingers when trying to pick them up. I used a stainless bowl as a collection bowl and it was too hot on the bottom to pick up - not from the air but from the unpopped kernels. I think that a plastic bowl would have melted. If you have this unit and if you also think it is a hazard, please submit a report to the consumer protection bureau at http://www.cpsc.gov/talk.html"
1,Can I give this no stars?,DO NOT BUY!! They Sent a 5$ Chinese made adapter that is the male version.. The same that is coming out of the computer so if I find my old Adapter perhaps I could charge that..
5,New Criterion Collection DVD to be released in MAY 2004!!,"The Criterion Collection will be releasing this movie for the first time ever on DVD. It will come out in May 2004. The retail price is $39.95 but as with most new Criterion DVDs, Amazon might be selling it for $29.95 soon after it comes out.Features:--New high-definition digital transfer, with restored image and sound.

2,OSI Large Blood Red Parrot Pellets,"I have 2 Blood Parrot tanks, which eat anything & everything in their homes. However, they will NOT eat this, especially after they have been eating my Oscar's Hikari Gold X-Large Pellets, while waiting for these to arrive. I guess I will be buying more of that brand. I have NOT EVER saw these sink after a while, like they are supposed to."
3,The dementors r coming. BOO!!,"This game is fun to play I really liked it. But there are pros and cons. Pros- Fly Buckbeak, Many spells but ur 3 characters can all use diff ones, Pretty good missions.Cons- graphics are sometimes better sometimes worse, no quidditch, slow loading and movement reaction, bad replay value,bad aiming. But all in all its a fairly good game it doesnt follow the movie and book very buch but oh well. My advice rent dont buy."
4,an okay game. nothing great,"Being a huge Harry Potter fan, of course I was going to buy this game, for myself and my son. But I have to say, I was slightly disappointed in the whole set up. The graphis are wonderful! Being able to change characters is very neat. But the game was to short. I was expecting more of a challenge. The first game, Sorcers Stone, was more indepth than this one. And it lasted a little longer. It is worth buying, but don't expect a whole lot. But then again, the movie based on the 3rd book wasn't that great either."
2,This game is okay...,"This game is not that great... The loading takes forever and the challenges are annoying and repetitive. It doesn't really follow the book or the movie. I wasn't really impressed. The Chamber of Secrets game was definitely better. Controlling the three characters starts out being fun, but soon grows to be very annoying. I wouldn't recommended this even to a fan (i am one)."
5,A very fun game.,This game was fun. If you like any of the other harry potter games youll like this one. It has fun puzzles.
1,Don't waste your money,This DVD is an absolute waste of money. I am an avid golfer and there is nothing new (much less ground-breaking) in this DVD. The author recommends 5 basic swing changes: (1) a narrower stance (2) no weight shift to the back foot on the backswing [ala Stack & Tilt]to facilitate turning around your spine axis (3) keep your back leg knee bent (4) push off of your backfoot's big toe to generate an active hip motion to power the swing (5)turn over the middle of your front foot on the downswing and swing your hips open fully.The presentation of information is not particularly scientific or compelling in selling its effectiveness. You would be better off spending your money elsewhere.
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,This is the most informational book I have ever read on RV maintenance. We have a travel trailer and it has come in handy many time when we needed a solution to a problem amd were unable to find the answer in other RV books. Would recommend this book to anyone with a RV or travel trailer of any type.
4,Good Information!!!!,A lot of good information in here for RV users that don't know too much about fixing things that go wrong in your RV!!!!!
5,Adorable!!!,"The frog footies are not only the cutest jammies going, they keep my daughter entertained. She loves the eyes on the feet and plays with them all the time. These are my absolute favorite. I keep buying the next size up!"
3,LINDA,FAST SHIPPING I JUST THOUGHT THIS SLEEPER WAS A LOT CUTER IN THE PICTURE THAN WHEN I GOT IT. I SENT IT BACK
4,Classic Puppets,Listening to it right now-- five years after I originally purchased it. Great collection and a great band. Highly recommend.
1,crapass game,"never could play it cause it was too scratched. i wont ever buy video games again, i seem to always end up burned like this on them."
4,The ABCs of Character Development!,"Author Marisa D'Vari shares insider secrets for creating colorful, rich characters. This book is the ABCs of character development; a blueprint for all forms of writing from screenwriting to novels. A 'must have' reference for any writer!"
3,Not such a big deal.,"While this book may be useful to the novice writer or one unfamiliar with personality assessment tools, I found it more irritating than helpful and not particularly original. Ms. D'vari has adapted the Myers-Briggs, Enneagram and the DISC to create her own, very simplistic, MORE system which she uses to help the writer develop the personality traits of the imagined characters.My biggest complaint with this book was that all of the question marks were upside down and backwards! This, along with numerous typos and/or misspelled words, indicates a lack of care in either the writer, the publisher or the editor. If you can overlook these, which I found to be more grating than nails on a chalkboard, perhaps you will discover more of interest than I did."
5,preview- ITS GONNA BE AMAZING,"I have just rented Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 for N64 and it a stunning game. Now if you do like THP2(how can you not?) then you will go crazy for THP2X. This game is going to have THP1 + 2 with 3 exclusive levels for the XBOX. It will have amazing graphics, and this cool blur effect when you have full special meter. Now you can go back to the old THP levels using the tricks scheme from the second game. Not only that but it will have Online Tournaments also. This game is going to be the best THP GAME out of all of them for every system.MUST BUY FOR XBOX"
2,This is a good game,"But Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 will come out on PS 2 before this game, you really want to buy a better virsion of 2 when 3 is already out? and 3 is much better than this one. so if you can go get 3 not this one you can also find it on amazon.com."
1,NO GUARANTEE GIVEN BY COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"bought airbed for Christmas gift (2008) -- the VERY FIRST TIME out of the box, it had T H R E E holes in. Tried to return using invoice info, but INVOICE ONLY states no return or guarantee on airbeds once opened. WELL, to get to the invoice, you MUST OPEN BED. Contacted company to no avail! Bed must have been old, dry rot, whatever! Now STUCK with GARBAGE. Beware of buying, better to buy locally from reputable store like WalMart, at least they accept returns."
4,It does what it says it will,"If you are looking for a convenient put up bed for a temporary visitor or as a stand by for your kids friends staying over, this is perfect for it!easy to inflate and deflate (although how you get it back in the box is a mystery) and feels very comfortable to sleep upon."
1,Exceptionally disappointed,Purchased an air mattress which started to leak after two weeks of use. I am exceptionally dissatisfied with the purchase and would like a complete refund of my original purchase price.
2,Not the Husky of yesteryear,"I repurchased this in December '08 to replace one that had ""lost its softness."" It is a tad larger than the one from a few years ago, but its plush is thinner and its eyes (oh get this) are cross-eyed now! He used to have such a beautiful face too, how sad TY is another company that seems to be hitting bottom. The picture doesn't quite capture his new face. At least the kids can learn to be sensitive to those a bit different than those that are ""normal"". So I gave it a few stars for educational."
1,Doesn't work and no instructions,The watch doesn't work and there are no instructions. So the fact that it arrived n time is irrelevant. Was a gift. Very disappointing. Won be using this vendor again.
4,pretty good,"It's basically a shooter game, and for me it got a little old after awhile, but there are several bright spots, like the ghost and the car. I am really looking forward to Microsoft getting broadband going for this game, over the internet. This will give Quake a run for it's money. It just seems like Microsoft is taking forever to get the xbox broadband thing going . . ."
5,...................buy..............it..........NOW!!!,"I can't even begin to tell you the reasons you should buy this game, but here is a summary: excellent graphics and backgrounds, challenging gameplay, and cool weapons. If you think this game is good, I just saw the full 8-minute playable demo trailer for Halo 2. If you know how good the first one was, then multiply that goodness by 12, and you will get a good idea on how Halo 2 will be."
3,Good Game but Certainly Overhyped,"3 stars is about right. It's not a ""bad"" game by any stretch of the imagination, but at the same time it is extremely overhyped and waaay too many people go around making outragious claims about how it is the greatest game in history. I personally think it's nothing more than a logical extension to the games like DOOM/Quake/Heretic, but something like DOOM was the originator and their designers had to come up with the idea in the first place. Halo is just a logical extension to these games... I can't give the Nobel prize to someone who just expands on the laser and adds a couple new features to it, I have to give it to the guy who first invents/discovers the laser to begin with."
2,Halorificfradgalistic,I love halo. mainly cuz its got shiney things in it. Shiney Shiney Shiney Shiney Shiney Shiney Shiney . Me and yawnie( no middle names for chickens) slapped each other with pudding from our nearby septic tank.then we drove towtrucks through san antonio and killed a mongoose.Then we played halo and we couldnt make the guys face appear so it sucked.
5,"Product works good, very fun game",The day I got my game in the mail I couldn't stop playing it! I finished it the day I got it and continue to still play it.This game arrived here very fast as well.
5,The Best I've Played in Years,"I have been waiting for a game this good to come out for a long time. This game has outstanding graphics, great sound, and is one of the most popular game around. At least on Xbox. When I got mine, Halo was the first to play on my list. This game has it all, a multiplayer mode. Were you can create your own kind of Multiplayer game or just pick a built in one. Also in multiplayer mode you can have a two player campaing so you don't have to play by yourself in single player mode. Or if you want, you can just play by yourself. You can choose the control configure and the color of the spartan you want to be. In the game you can use diferent weapns, human and alien. And will also be able to use vehicles (again, human or alien)in some levels to. Although the game is short I would rate the best!"
3,Meh,"I don't see what's so ground breaking about this game. I own it, played through single player, tossed it aside. Multiplayer in this game is a limited market. The only two levels with vehicles are too big for a small number of people and the rest are basically junk no matter how many people you have. Not to mention some major lag with any more than two people playing at once. As for story, I don't seem to be seeing much in the game. The book was great, but the game seemed kinda choppy. They don't tell anything leading up to landing on the ring. And while on the ring all you learn is that it's a weapon and you have to blow it up. If you're looking for a fun FPS, get this, but don't expect all the hype to be true."
1,Halo is too bloody,"Dear parents...This is a really bloody game. It really fills your kids heads with garbage. We dont want to have another Columbine do we? If your kids want an X box, the only reason is to get this game. Even if you dont buy it for them they will somehow end up owning it. If you want to give your kids the maximum clean enjoyment this christmas, go with a Game Cube, form Nintendo. The games on that system are much funner, and a lot less bloody.Good luck shopping..."
1,Halo`s,I hate this gamebecause its Out of Realityin Other Words I hate the firstI like the action & the horror
1,"OmG Liyke, TehH Halerz izzie tah r0><0rZ","Excuse the title, It is the total opposite of ""r0><0rZ"" This game had the privledge of wasting away at millions of peoples lives. If that wasn't bad enough, the game is no better than a simple game, like James Bond, it eats away at your head, until you have to buy the t-shirts, breakfast cereals, the ""licensed"" master chief helmet, then you try a game like Resident Evil 4, or the pure gold that is ""life"" you realize, hey, that's what light looks like!, and more importantly, hey... halo kinda sucks."
1,Dissappointed,"The disc seemed brand new but it didn't work. My household was looking forward into playing Halo, the first edition as an activity and the result was a disappointing."
