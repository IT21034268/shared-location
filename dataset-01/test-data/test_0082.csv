1,This is my first Anne Rice book,"This, unfortunately, was the first Anne Rice book I've ever read. Please don't tell me that all her books are like this."
2,NOT one of her best works!,"This book does not engross you like the rest of her books. I had trouble finishing it and thought the characters were rather shallow. Also, not much action/movement from the characters -- mostly crying. It's OK if you have nothing better to read."
1,What happened to Anne!,"From the beginning, this book was suspiciously autobiographical and was certainly not a quick read since I didn't really care to finish it. I held out all hope that it would get better. It didn't. Utterly depressing and not in all the classic style of Anne Rice. It was all over the place. However, there is hope. I recently sped through a copy of Pandora, a worthy return to the vampire chronicles, and look forward to reading Armand. Forget she ever wrote this book."
1,She won't turn around.,"Anne Rice is totally written out. She shouldn't be dumping that crap on her readers, but frankly, I don't blame her in the least for continuing to pump it out and collect her money, which she will continue to do as long as people think she's somehow going to turn around - so they keep reading. She won't turn around. She's pretty pathetic."
3,Better than the last two.,"Anne Rice may need to branch out and find another genre. While this book has lovely imagery, it lacks the page turning suspense of The Witching Hour and the senuality of The Vampire Chronicles. Triana is an average heroine at best. Wait for the paperback version."
1,Not interesting,"I have read almost all Anne Rice books, I did not like this one, the writer did not catch me this time, and I am looking forward to Anne's next book"
1,Really bad!,"I definitely agree with most of the reviewers;I don't know if I can get through this one. It is preposterous! I have read most everything of hers, and I think that maybe she should go back to historical fiction. A Feast of All Saints was her finest moment!"
2,Repetitive . . . Redundant . . . Regretful . . .,"Having read most of everything Anne Rice has written in her long and varied career, I am thoroughly disgusted by her last book, Violin. It has taken me more time to wade through one chapter of this book than to read the entire Vampire series. Is this just a filler (for her bank account) until she can become inspired again to write something more to her standards? Please, if you have nothing better to write, leave the page blank."
2,Not so pleased,"Plain and simple...I just didn't see what all the ""glorious reviews"" were about. Was I reading the same book the other critics were? For as short a book as it was, it was a waste of my time. I'm a reader who needs more ""meat"" to a story line. Perhaps one that isn't so predictable either!"
2,I'll Have None of It,"Overwrought. Underwhelming. Far from finding it humorous, I instead smirked at times at some of the breathless, panting blathering by Enda. The fish tale was mildly interesting, but that's all it was, a fish tale. Makes me wonder mightily about all of these breathless, panting reviews here."
5,A priceless Gem,"The relationship of a priest and a long time female friend, is shown to be priceless. A jewel of a story."
5,"Hook, line and sinker--this book netted me!","Few books hook me right off, but in this case, the writing was so wonderful--yes, exquisite--that once I started I wished the book was much longer. The feverish description of fishing the cove put a smile on my face the entire time. I was right there with Father...suffering and otherwise. A small story, expansively told."
3,Movie Seems Diffrent...,"The actors in this movie did a great job; whatmade this movie lose potential was the ending(Which I will not reveal).Here's how the storyline goes.A young adult named Thomas visits a Web Cam Siteand falls in love with a nice looking lady. Hedevelops a habbit of watching her on his screen.One day he logs on to her site and can't access it.He then proceeds to ""gain access"" to it. He viewshis ""internet girl"" as usual. Two seconds laterThomas sees his lady get slaughtered.The Police can not seem to help since the killer ismasked and Thomas viewed remotely. But then a beautifulpolice officer named Claire gets involved. Afterward,Thomas and Claire set up their own web cam hoping toattract the killer. Things really started to really startto get interesting. The movie was great until the ending."
2,Three Blind Mice **SPOILER**,"I agree with Dustin B - shame not to see Edward Furlong in T3 - this movie had so much potential (in the realm of Hitchcock) but went wrong in so many ways - it insulted the audience several times (old-fashioned cops and a hacker with a knack for buggin whose place is broken into and he doesn't check for bugs or wonder why someone was even there?) The ending fight was pretty lame tho the twist wasn't too bad - the older actors weren't very good - too stereotypical and one dimensional. It had the strangest clash of a 1940's/2004 that didnt mix. And yes, Furlong did seem too tired too much of the time (there were actual scenes where it looked like he had a good night's sleep). If you want to see something not so technical but along the same lines - rent 8mm"
3,Mellow 60's standards,"This collection is nothing we haven't seen before. The songs are good enough but there's not enough variety to really show the music revolution of the 60's. The early hits are represented, from classic teen lament ( ""It's My Party"") to more mellow contributions (summer standard ""Under The Boardwalk"" and the soulful ""Stand By Me""). Given that the 60's resulted in a dynamic change in musical style, I was hoping for a better musical representation. A good one to get if you are just beginning a collection."
2,Not for somebody who is obsessed with Harry Potter,"My friend and I who aer obsessed with Harry Potter decided to buy this book when we were having withdrawl symptoms. We thought it would be great read other predictions as well as seeing what other people think the books mean. Unfortuantly the book did not meet our expectations. There were many mistakes and they also wouldn't discuss what happens at the end of each book and therefore didnt' discuss the books in much depth. I think that if you are obsessed with Harry Potter like me, this book isn't for you."
5,best world poetry anthology I've seen,The breadth of this anthology is amazing. I pull it off the shelf and browse through it at least a few times each week.
4,Slim Shady is back by popular demand!!,"Eminem's new Cd is great!!! My favorite is Without Me. But I am also partiall to Superman, Soldier, and Sing for the Moment. I love the way he took my favorite song ""Dream On"" and added his style to it. This is a must for all Slim Shady fans.....Marshall's gone; Shady's back!!"
5,Em's Best Albumn,"Ok after listening to his first two albumns I didnot really enjoy his music minus a few songs however when I first listened to ""The Eminem Show"" I must say I was presently suprised that he changed his style a little bit from the catchy radio friendly songs to the more harder, emotional style that the Eminem Show has. My fav's on the albumn are ""Superman"", ""Square Dance"", ""Say What You Say"" & ""Till I Collapse"". Two songs on the albumn that I really didn't enjoy at first but see my self coming back to time after time now are ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"" in which the third verse of that song is one of Em's best verses ever and the song taken from the Aerosmith classic Dream On, ""Sing For The Moment"". This albumn is tight all the way through however and you don't need to skip any tracks when you play this. Definetly a classic albumn and I believe the Albumn of the year."
5,The Eminem Show,"This is the best CD ive ever had. I think that it is his best work yet.He's a genius and this cd proves it. I love each and every one of the songs on there, not to metion that he made a Fantastic movie and that just made it better. All in all it say that this is the best Cd so far."
3,God loves you,you most ask for what you wan't but you have to be a good person a man or woman of God read your bible do all the things that God said do and if you do God well here your prayer God well here the rightous he well answer your prayer but if your wicket or in sin God well not bless you so be saved put God first you have not becuse you ask not have faith to that it well happen put your trust and God count on him.
2,beginning of shady's downfall,"after coming out with the great 'marshall mathers lp', eminem didnt even come close with this one. his lyrics dont seem to flow and the songs just dont seem right. even his voice has become annoying. it sounds higher and forced. i loved the mathers lp.. this was a big disappointment."
1,Horrible,I cant believe that someone could go around and rap things like that. Im not dissing Eminem. But I really dont like this cd. The stuff he sings about is just way to horrible and violent. I would suggest KJ-52 instead of Em. He sounds just like Eminem just without the violent lyrics.
1,Pop garbage....,"Eminem is nowhere near being the greatest rapper ever. That title goes to a man named Tupac Shakur. Eminem could never hope to even be on the same PLANET at Tupac, much less actually better than him. Eminem is a fad who will die down in the next couple years, when his teeny bopper fanbase moves on to the next ""in"" thing. This album, like all his others, is mediocre at best, complete crap at worst. Now, if you want a REAL classic album, but ""All Eyez on Me"" instead. That album easily destroys any Eminem album.So recognize and realize. The greatest rapper of all time died September 13th 1996....."
5,Eminem's greatest,"There aint no dissin now bout eminems new disk! He has put all the haters to rest with this one. Everyone just thought he was another one hit wonder but after his three tight albums there's no thinkin that anymore. The Eminem Show has gots to be his greatest. He raps bout issues like Bin Laden, drug use, and even lets his mind flow bout the dealings with his wife! Scratch that! Ex wife. The best has gotta be ""My Dad's gone Crazy"", the track with his daughter on it. Who says he ain't a loving father? Anyhows, you gotta peep this cd if you havent!"
5,A Great Album,I blieve that this is a truly great Album and one of Eminem's best works. The songs are expressed wonderfully and have very powerful messages.To anyone who believes that this a negitive album and you should really sit down and listen carefully.
1,A SILLY RAPPIN FOOL THAT GOT HIZ NAME FROM A CANDY,"AHHHH!!! Thiz retarted world today with crappy muzik...everyone that listens to new muzik including thiz silly whiteboy name M&M are idiots and should start listenin to real rap that was made in the 90-99....thiz whiteboy iz silly with hiz muzik wit little kids voices in the background sayin ""ahh""...""Oh My Gosh""....what kind of muzik iz that....that eminem boy iz silly because he was grippin on dr dre and 50 penniez nutz....yall should listen to 2pac, 3-6 mafia or tommy wright III...thatz real rap muzik yo can bump to....If you bump thiz eminem cd, then you will look like a bozo driving a clown car...actually all theze people in this world are clowns because yall are brainwashed by crappy muzik and yall dont know bout the real or underground muzik yall are missing....all people that listen to new muzik are people that want to fit in and make some friends...hahahaha sad people nowadays"
4,"Grows on you...especially after listening to the embarassing ""Encore""","I was originally dissapointed with this album...I kinda let this cd sit on top of a pile of laundry for a few years until I actually listened to it again after his last album ""Encore"". Compared to Encore, the Eminem Show is much more cohesive and better thought out. Yeah, there are some tracks like Drips and Hallie's Song that shoulda been left off the cd, but gems like ""Till I Collapse"", ""Soldier"", ""Saying Goodbye to Hollywood"" and ""Square Dance"" wipe out any track on Encore. Hopefully on Em's next LP he will eliminate any of the crap like ""Just Lose It"" and ""Big Weenie"" that destroyed Encore. Purchase Eminem Show or his earlier work instead of his recent disaster."
5,Whose 2pac's Biggest Fan???,"Well, duh! Eminem! The guy can't keep 2pac's name out of his mouth. He has made more than thirty references of 2pac's name from his last two albums.""Below are some of Eminem's references to 2pac on his latest album.'Square Dance'Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies.""'Soldier'""I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence.""...'Say What U Say'""Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punkDon't give a ...! White 'Pac, so much spunk.""'Till I Collapse'""The criminal cop killin hip-hop villain/A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners/You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it/Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us.""""It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me."""
1,This cd has horrible songs and disturbing lyrics,"O.K. to start out with this CD has horrible songs in some songs there just playing a rock song as eminem raps to it with lyrics that are not good and possibly just for shock value. Its the same thing as all the other cd's when the first came out they were different and many people liked them but now its the same songs almost with a incredible amount of curseing. It wont surprise me to see his next album say ""Now with 40% more bad language FREE!"" His songs lack any writeing talent. His main audience is white kids from like 13-20. Theres so many other rap artists better than him. Although all rap has bad lyrics his are perticullary bad talking about how he hates his wife and how he hates certain races etc. This cd is a embarrasment to music."
2,A shameful display by Eminem,"After Eminem's first 2 albums he really did show a lot of potential and i wasnt ashamed to say i liked his music even though i was and am a die-hard pac fan. But this album is a BIG step in the wrong direction for Eminem, just when things were looking up for him, he had the rap world at his feet and blew it with this album full of songs containing nonsense and meaningless songs which appeal to the younger generations, the only plus's on this album are 'Say Goodbye to Hollywood' which he does show the potential of his talents, and the song 'Till I Collapse' which relies heavily on Nate Dogg's chorus to keep the listener's interest. Overall a poor display by Eminem who seems to have been consumed by the media and the attention on him, long live 2pac, Nas i think it's down to you now to pull the rap game out of the terrible terrible state it is in!"
1,There's no such thing as good rap!,"After hearing all the hype about this album, I had to experience it for myself. Why are people so obsessed about a guy that sings so fast no one can understand him? People actually think he can sing? He can't! I'd rather listen to fingernails against the blackboard instead of listening him ""trying"" to sing.In his song ""without Me,"" why dis a bunch of people he doesn't like? Does he have to be that childish to toilet talk them in a song? Please, who ever thinks this is music, seriously needs to have their head examined."
1,the star has fallen,okay- when he first came out- he was the sh#@. now- what? same played out style. couple of okay tracks- beat wise only. on top of all that- he dares to diss the great Canibus? that is suicide.he needs to go back to his freestyling/battle raps. this cd sucks. so does everyone who gives him a 5 star rating.
4,Really should be 4 and 3/4...,"Marshall Mathers LP was Em's best album. Let me get that out of the way first. The Eminem Show is a great album. There are certain tracks that I love, like Drips, Superman, I Think My Dad's Gone Crazy, White America and (suprisingly) Hailie's Song. I think Obie Trice could possibly be the next huge thing, but he needs to get out on his own. Stay with Shady Records, but get his own album out! I think it was good idea to finally put Hailie on a song. He has talked about her for so long, and she makes the song funnier than it normally would've been...Eminem has his own style, that either you love or you don't. I know many people who love rap, that don't really like Em. I listen to all sorts of music, and rap isn't at the top of my list. I love metal, but I love Eminem's rhymes? Maybe I'm messed up too..."
4,Not a Musician.,"Eminem is not a musician. Comparing him with one would be stupid and a waste of time. Eminem is also not just a rapper. At least not a pop-friendly rapper. (EX. Jay-Z, Nelly, or P Diddy, who just rap about how rich they are and how much they hate other rappers who are succesful.) This album has quite a few weak spots, but for every weak spot, there is an equally poignant spot to compensate. I have never come close to witnessing the raw power and emotion that can be brought to my speakers with rap. I don't even particularly like rap, save for Saul Williams. Check out HIS new album called: Amethyst Rock Star...it will blow your mind. So in conclusion, Em is not a musician. Em is a rapper with something to get off his chest, and he should be viewed that way...and not compared to anything else."
1,This Show is Cancelled!!!,"I heard a friend of mine's copy of this desperate CD, and I thought it was a new Weird Al effort. The nasal whining, the weak attempts at shock value and humor, the songs that any 4 year old could write (what PATHETIC lyric writing!}, and the overall and total lack of talent. I laughed so hard at some points, and sad at others because of the tragic result of someones need for attention. Negative attention is better than none at all, I guess. Please, do not waste your time, attention, or money on this. Go buy Moby's ""18"" instead. I did."
1,LISTEN TO REAL RAP!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHY CANT YOU PEOPLE GET IT HE AINT THE BEST RAPPER IN THE WORLD HE SUX!!!!!! ITS NOT CUZ HES WHITE THAT I HATE HIM ITS CUZ HES NOT FROM THE HOOD AND HE GETS ALL THE GLORY WHILE OTHER RAPPERS ARE CRITICIZED FOR PROMOTIN VIOLENCE. DONT BUY THIS CRAP. BUY ALBUMS FROM NOTORIOUS BIG, ICE CUBE, TUPAC, DR DRE EVEN THO HE CREATED THIS MESS HES STILL GOOD, SNOOP DOGG, WU TANG CLAN, NWA, NAS, JAY Z BEFORE HE TURNED POP, WESTSIDE CONNECTION, ETC. tHESE RAPPERS PUT REAL EMOTION INTO THEIR MUSIC AND BRING UP IMPORTANT POLITICAL ISSUES. i DONT HAVE A PROBLEM WIT WHITE RAPPERS I HAVE A PROBLEM WIT RAPPERS WHO AINT FROM THE HOOD. I LIKE SOME 80S AND 70S ROCK LIKE THE RED HOT CHILLI PEPPERS WHO ARE VERY CREATIVE."
4,He's Done It Again,"Eminem has manged to produce yet another album that is full of great tracks that stays true to his roots. The Eminem Show, is bound to offend some people, as his previous albums have, but then if you dont like it you dont have to listen. Without Me is the first single release and its shows you what you can expect from this album. A must have for any fan"
5,A Darker Eminem,"The best Eminem album ever. The artist has obviously matured and taken a role in the industry as a giant and a true iconic symbol of rap. The DVD is a little gimicky, but the CD is extrodianry."
2,Not like it was,"I'm sorry but this cd isn't good. It not bat or some thang but eminem ain't commin hard, know I mean. On the The Marshall Mathers LP he came raw, with songs like B Please II, Remember me and so on. So ya'll betta gon' cop cd's of Tha DPGC'z (Snoop Kurupt, daz) and of dr. Dre (NWA) that's all better. There 's only 1 real good song on this album: 'Till I Collapse . O yeah: Dre is also commin weak on this cd.Peace!"
2,Good Rhymes but Horrible Production,"Eminem can rhyme no doubt, but his production is horrible...Only when he leaves the beats to Dre does this album pick up steam.Worst Em album ever."
5,Excellent,"When I first heard this album I was surprised, I felt that he hadn't moved up from Marshall Mathers LP, I felt there wasn't that much of the raw anger, as there were no songs like Kim on there. Yet listening back on Marshall Mathers LP to the Eminem Show you realise that Eminem has grown musically, the ryhmes, the way he spits and the content are much more mature then before. The issues are even realer,that the anger is there just more on an hidden layer. In my eyes this album is excellent! Not only has he moved on with his lyrics he's beats are incredible as is his content and lyrics. Many of the songs are heartfelt, yet there is still some of the jokey songs that Eminem is well known for. I can relate to this album and see his pain with the whole pistol whipping incident. An excellent album for those fans and non fans!Not only is he buff but he is talented! Buy The Album!!"
3,A very special episode...,"Eminem's first two albums were fun dirty songs with grooving beats you could dance to, but this album isn't funny and doesn't have any grooving beats. All the songs(minus ""without me"") are slow and depressing, not a rockin' groove or a clever joke to be found. I give him three starts for trying to do something different but hopefully he will get out of this slow period and start making dirty party records again!!!"
3,"Excellent Beats, Childish and Annoying Rhymes","Just like every other slim Shady album, this is a combination of great hooks, great beats, but completely wack rhymes. Its not that he isnt talented, its that he has the mentality of a 10 year old when he rhymes. It gets three stars for the production (which is mostly handled by em) but when he's actually rapping it's nothing but nasal rantings.(example my dad's gone crazy) I'm waitng for a Eminem album that lives up to his potential, i might be waitng a long time..."
4,4.5-STAR Marshall the Master,"Eminem's third album, The Eminem Show, lacks the amazing tracks of the Marshall Mathers LP, such as ""Marshall Mathers,"" ""Criminal,"" and ""Stan."" However, this album is by far the MC's most consistent and actually is the second best of his three albums. The smash single ""Without Me"" is the most radio friendly track, while ""Say What You Say"" featuring Dr. Dre is an excellent response to Jermaine Dupri's boasting. ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and ""White America,"" though, are the album's two standout tracks. The former song puts an end to Eminem's feud with his mother Debbie Mathers, while the latter is a brilliant (and incredibly harsh) diatribe insulting American stereotypes and advocates of censorship such as Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. All in all, the album is well worth the price becuase of its incredible consistency-- THERE ARE NO BAD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM."
1,possibly the worst cd ever,I have written bad reviews of eminem before but the eminem show is definitly the worst thing to ever come from him. When it was first released it was a really big deal but I don't see what's so great about it. I borrowed it and listened to it but I coldn't stand to listen to the whole thing. The song white america is basicly a disclaimer saying that he can't help it if white people listen to his music. The reason why only white people listen to his music is because he's racist but he wont admit it. Eminem is such a cocky jerk I don't know how anyone can stand to listen to him or work with him.
5,Eminem & Dre do it again!,"Eminem is back with the best cd he has put out. This cd is like all the other cds he has put out. He raps about people he doesn't like, like Moby, Jermaine Dupri, and Kim. This cd has Dr.Dre and D-12 on it. The best song on the cd is the one with Dre on it when they rap about Jermaine Dupri. He even sings on one of the songs even though he can't sing at all. Everybody should have this cd."
4,Eminem shows why he's one of the best,"Actually, to me, this album gets 4 1/2 stars. It is that good. I love most of the songs. Not only is this album different sonically from The Marshall Mathers LP, but Eminem gets more personal. Also, the rock mix in some of the songs give them grit and power. Standout tracks for me include: White America, Business, Square Dance, Without Me, Superman, When the Music Stops, Till I Colapse and My Dad's gone crazy.This album would have gotten five stars if the song ""Drips"" wouldn't have been included. This song is absolutely awful. One of the worst rap songs I've ever heard."
4,it does the job,I send this product for my aunt in germany. It does the job but I believe its a little too pricy for the small amount of make up.
1,This was terrible,"I almost bought this to complete my Night of The Living dead Collection. I am so glad I didn't. The 2006 version of this was okay, although some things were changed. This version is just downright boring, and has a thin plot. It's all about zombis living in the crematorium. I honestly thought this movie would be good, and I really tried to like it. I am glad i caught this on netlix for free before i purchased this movie. I would buy this movie to complete my collection, but it better be in the $5.00 bin first. It really is that bad. Watch it on Netflix, and then decide. I can't imagine anyone liking it. The cast isn't bad, and the film quality is good. It's just that the script killed this whole movie"
3,ok 3d zombie flick.,"This is a direct prequel to the notld 3d feature of 2006. This one is in 3d blu ray and looks better. The 3d is decent and mainly used for depth. I believe this was shot in 3d, and not processed in that format. It's good enough but there is not 2d version on this blu ray so if you don't have a 3d player then you can't watch it. You need the player and tv for this one. The 3d is not terrible though as the others said , it's just not a popout movie much. They at least have two good actors in this one and I thought it was a average zombie flick. the gore and zombies are good enough too. It's not a action zombie flick though, it's more character driven and too many people today want endless zombie kills and no plot. You get plot here and acting and some zombies. I like the other kind of zombie flick though too. Still this has a story to it and is good enough as it was shot in 3d on low grade film."
3,Better Lyrics + Worst production=OKay album,I noticed that his lyrics are a tad better.I was a fan of Pastor Troy but he is far from a great rapper.He does try hardat least.He is a cult icon down in Georgia and has a ok albumLyrics 7/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 6/10 Classic 7/10 Me 7/10Overall-62 This album will pick up 3 Mics
2,The title of the album tells all...,"By any means necessary..sounds desperate dosen't it...kinda like this last ditch attempt by pastor to put a album out..what happened to the face off and u. souldier pt cruisa...Why is his name still pastor? His whole flow has changed...He went from a man wit a message to someone jus sayin ""fugg ya'll"" and ""i love atlanta alot""...Honestly only two good tracks....Maybe"
2,Aint feeling it,I have to say its a few tracks on this album that are tight . Worth buyin ...NO. I wasted my money an yes i sold it back. I mean compared to some of the new albums out its like a 1 star up against MP good side bad side and lil flip ....THis album is garbage . Pastor troy u aint ready anymore.
2,Not for Couples,"Although there are several very good photographs in here, I found the tone of the work trashy. There is quite a lot of fetish type photographs, as well as large amount of lesbian depiction. Although the images are not all that explicit they 'feel' pornographic rather than erotic.This is not a problem in itself, but the title makes it sound more like something for the erotic pleasure of couples in the style of the excellent Eros compiled by Linda Ferrer.If fetish etc is your thing, go for it. If you are looking for something classily erotic to share with the love of your life, this is not it."
1,No thanks...,What a stupid movie! Cybil Shepard talks WAY too fast to enjoy any of her dialog. The point of the movie is to show how uppety high society could be back then but I couldn't help but agree with them! The things she did were just wierd and tooo flirty. It is a g rating so it is viewable by the whole family but I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one!
5,Professor,This is an excellent book providing a comprehensive look at information technology in the tourism industry. The perspective of the authors is clearly IT. I would strongly recommend this book as a reader for senior level undergraduate and graduate level classes in this area. The authors should be commended for providing the first comprehensive look at the tourism industry.
4,"entertaining and thought-provoking, with one provisio","I enjoyed this book because it presented some thought-provoking ideas and was fun to read. My one provisio is that I wasn't entirely comfortable with the idea of feeling sympathetic toward a demon, nor with the idea that a demon would repent if given the chance. I simply don't believe that is possible. God is always just--toward all His creatures. But let's not quibble: the book was enjoyable and presented some interesting interpretations of Genesis that were worth contemplating. It was fun to read."
5,warm and dry,it meets all my needs being that I travel alot from country to country. No matter what the weather is it fits.
1,Worst book ....,"This book is not well written. I am sorry to say that but that is correct. To learn a new language, one has to know the rules and not just start reading. As someone else pointed out, books does not tell you about past participle or future tense, until very late in the game......"
5,SIMPLY THE BEST ALL AROUND POCKET KNIFE,"I have many pocket knives of high quality and high cost, but this knife has unquestionably been my everyday favorite for years. I sharpen the blades to a very flat grind geometry making them almost surgically sharp and they still hold their edge for several weeks of daily cutting use. You can crock stick these right back to shaving sharp as well if you prefer the steeper edge grind. This combination of tools is the best and the least I can live with. Occasionally scissors and pliers would be handy, so I may have to look at other tinker models. I try often to switch to nice folders or even a bone handled case but I always come back to my swiss army tinker."
3,"Good quality, outdated tool selection","Victorinox makes fine products, and this model is lovely, classic, and durable. However, it is missing tools that you will probably want, such as scissors, while including things you rarely use. (Also, a blade that locks open is preferable for safety.) Pick another model and you (or your gift recipient) will be happier."
4,Another great book,"I really liked this second book and thought it was a good continuation of the original. The plot was good and there were many surprises, just not enough detail. I liked Stine's books for kids and I like how he's started to write books for more mature teenagers. Good book."
1,Very superficial book,"I didnt liked the book. I'm really a samurai's books fan and i'm intersting in Japan.The characters in the book are very superficial and the calumny is not suit to Japan in those times and also very shellow. It looks like the author wrote the book without really study japan's culture in the time where the story takes place. It may be good book for childrens although it is very violent. Maybe i compred it to ""Shogun"" by James Clavell which is a better book on that time, by far."
1,too late...,It seems some foreign bio terrorism agent had already started eating at this man's brain before he put pen to paper.
4,pop at its very best,Its a shame these boys have split up seeing as they made this piece of pop perfection now all we're left with is n'sync.full of heartwarming love songs and sopme rather suprising moments('gunning down romace' a true addition to the dark side of pop).this albums does seem to be more about the lyrics than about the look of the band.shame to see them go really.
5,Affirmation has a true meaning,Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones really out do themselves with this album. Affirmation is a c.d. full of emotion that lets listeners know they're not alone. this c.d. can really reach out and touch your heart!
5,Definitely Worth It,"What a great CD...purchased it for ""I Knew I Loved You"" and now listen to EVERY song over and over. Definitely worth buying!"
5,TOOK ME BACK TO A WONDERFUL TIME IN MY LIFE,"""I KNEW I LOVED YOU... AS A LITTLE GIRL I ALWAYS DREAMT OF WHAT MY PRINCE CHARMING WOULD BE LIKE. I WAS 16 YRS. OLD WHEN I FINALLY MET HIM AND COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO THE MAN I DREAMED I WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH. AFTER MANY YEARS OF A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP WE PARTED WAYS, BUT HE IS STILL AND ALWAYS WILL BE MY BEST FRIEND. I ACTUALLY DID LOVE HIM BEFORE I MET HIM.THESE GUYS ARE DEEP, EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO THAT SONG I GO BACK TO THAT VERY SPECIAL TIME IN MY LIFE. THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES , I WISH YOU MUCH SUCCESS"
3,"Okay, but all the same","I can't say as I didn't like this album, but the songs all sound the same. If they varied in tune a little more this would be an awesome album. A little more work put into the emotion of the music would also do this album some good. Other than that, 3 stars well earned!"
5,The Best Album Ever!!,"Savage Garden's most recent album, Affirmation, has to be the best album I have ever heard (and I have heard a lot!). Their music is just astounding. The words are so emotionally moving, and when they are put together with beautiful harmonies, the product is just too amazing for words. The Australian duo, which consists of singer/songwriter Darren Hayes and instrumentalist Daniel Jones, write their own music, which shows a huge amount of talent. Not to mention that Darren's aching falsetto is SO amazingly beautiful and Daniel is very talented at playing whatever instrument is needed. Whether you liked their self-titled debut album or not, you will undoubtedly love this one. I would rate this 100 stars if I could, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone."
1,They were okay to listen to ocassionaly on the radio,"That's when I got interested in them. I liked their ballad songs especailly. But when I had a chance to listen to Affirmation in a CD store, I passed on it. It just had too many songs that sounded like really bland filler. Something also just bothers me about guys who use falsetto the whole time. When I first heard some of the songs, I could've sworn it women signing it. Just looking at the guys (really effeminate looking) and also knowing they use falsetto makes you obviously think they are gay, but of course I can't prove that. If they are, they should come out about it so it wouldn't make people ask embarassing questions about them. People would say they're in love..."
4,"Different than the last album, but still good...","I was surprised at the variety and inventiveness of all the songs on their self-titled cd, finding each song to have a special something that clicked and found a nitch. This album isn't quite like that. It has beautifully written songs and is carefully and wonderfully arranged, but only perhaps three or four songs really stand out as being ""different"" (Affirmation, Chained to you, The animal song, Gunning down romance.). The rest of the songs are absolutely beautiful (I knew i loved you and Hold me are breathtaking) and worth listening to, but they don't stand out. I do like this whole cd, save two songs (You can still be free and Two beds and a coffee machine), and would recommend it highly."
2,Good when taken with a dose of depression.,"Let me first say that I loved the first album. It was more of a dance/techno thing that made me surge with energy. AFFERMATION is nothing like the original. Instead of having an up-beat rythem and fast lyrics, this album is focused on ""Someone to watch over me."" This album is not for the average good mood, however, if your boyfriend/girlfriend has just broken up with you, if your parents are divorcing, or if everybody hates you and you have to eat worms, this is the album for you. Those who love self-pitty, this is your lucky day."
5,They are great talented guys!,"I love the cd. At first, I too, brought the cd just for the song ""I knew I love you"" but after listening to the rest, I fell in love with the songs. I play it over, over, and over agian when I'm bored. It's easy listening and it gets you hyped. The first cd, I brought just for the song ""truly Madly Deeply."" That was an awsome cd as well. I love the song ""universe."" Overall, I'm a huge fan I savage garden. Hopefully, they will stay great and have another cd out soon."
4,I knew I loved you before I heard you,"Savage Garden is a very talented group, wonderful lyrics and great beats. ""Affirmation"" proves they are here to stay. The songs are great, but need a little more variety. ""The Animal Song"" is my favorite song on the album but there are many other great songs on it. Savage Garden is passionate and just growing into their music. I can see their next album being even better!"
5,Savage Garden Rules!,"I love these guys, and this album is even better than the first! Full of so many wonderful inspiring songs that just make me feel so good. :) I highly recommend it!"
5,The best CD ever!,"This is the best CD I have ever heard. I've been listening to it almost every single day since I got it (which is almost a year and a half ago). It is that good. I had just recently lent my CD to a friend and he told me it's making him a fan now. If you like upbeat songs, you'll probably like ""Affirmation,"" ""The Best Thing,"" or ""Chained to You."" If you like slow songs, you'll definitely love the rest of the album. My most favourite songs include ""I Knew I Loved You"" (which is a simple love song), ""Crash and Burn"" and ""Two Beds and a Coffee Machine"" (this is a sad song about spousal abuse). Not only are the lyrics good but also the music. Darren and Daniel are definitely genuises. They are the best. If you liked the first album, you'll definitely like this one (unless you think slow songs are boring). It's WAY better than the first. They songs are more poetic and more mature than their first album. If you haven't already got the CD, I suggest you try it out."
5,They made it again!,"After many listenings to the record I must say it's great! The Animal Song, their first singel is still great. I Knew I Loved You is weaker. I also don't like Two Beds And... and I Don't Know You Anymore. They're too slow.THE BEST: You Can Still Be Free and Gunning Down The Romance. Especially ""You Can Still Be Free"", which is among the best songs I've ever heard.Affirmation, Crash And Burn, Hold Me, The Best Thing, Chained To You and The Best Thing is also great songs and they can all be big hits!"
4,good book,kind of outdated.. Product did arrive in a timely fashion.. It is a great starter book to have as a reference.
3,"Nice glasses, but lacks durability","The glasses have good fit and great style. The lenses work well. However the plastic frames are quite thin and do not stand up well. The frames broke the third time I wore them, but were repairable with super glue."
2,Not what I ordered,"(-2 stars for getting the order wrong) I ordered the clear lenses; I received the smoked lenses. I don't know that I'll have a use for bifocal sunglasses, but I'll give them a try. I had hoped to use these for working on my home renovation (indoor electrical, plumbing, etc work), but the smoked lenses are just too dark for that. For the price I paid, I'm not willing to spend almost the same amount of money to repackage and send these back.(-1 star for making me have to go look for another, similar item) Self-explanatory.If I find out later that these are actually useful to me, I'll come back and update this."
1,"A waste of good cash,my friend.","Buy something else with your hard earned money,my friend.I have been involved with Pez since the 50's and I am tired of the constant profiteering.Ed Haas must be turning over in his grave,my friend."
1,Waste of money!!,"Sorry to even have to give this one star. This is a joke and the only use I have gotten out of it, is lining my bird cage. Don't waste your money."
1,Not Good,"If you've listened to Double Eclipse, STOP RIGHT THERE. Great CD. Everything after that sucks. They are terrible live. They butcher all of the great songs from Double Eclipse on this live gig........it is really bad."
2,Don't buy it.,"Clumsy attempts at eroticism usually come out vulgar, as did this. Alternating scenes of the movie and the home movie within it is only one example."
2,Cheesy,"The Lickerish Quartet, though tame by today's standards comes from an era when for a movie to have some explicit content would have to be deemed ""to have political, social or artistic value"". The ""experimental"" aspects of The Lickerish Quartet are weird or don't make sense like sudden cuts to Bosch paintings or a couple making love on a floor with words written on it as from a dictionary that suddenly happen to be words relating to sexual terms. The whole ""was it real or just a dream?"" plot barely pieces together. It is a relic of its time. Radley Metzger, unlike Russ Meyer (Mudhoney, Vixen) the other ""auteur"" of this genre puts together a film that is fun to watch as a camp classic but otherwise will have you scratching your head one minute and laughing the next."
4,Fascinating study,"I learned of this book watching a ""Booknotes"" re-run on C-SPAN, and found Elsa Walsh's discussion intriguing enough to buy and read her book. While a longtime enthusiastic believer in the wisdom, strength and talents of women, but who also believes women and girls continue to be considered inferior or unworthy (in some cases by members of BOTH genders), I still found this book to be a fascinating study of how these women had to struggle to attain their full potential. I'm a man, but I know from my experience that countless women today are totally unaware of these kind of struggles by their sisters. I also have to wonder, based on periodic and recent observations, what women continue to experience today. I fear that things may not have improved all that much, and I'd like to see an updated version.I bought copies for my daughters, all of whom were youngsters or not yet born when this book was written."
3,there are no answers here,"While the book is well-written, there are no answers here. There are women who need to stick to their priorities and accept the tradeoffs that come with them (Meredith Viera) and who need to take a realistic look at the choices they've made (Rachael Worby). These are women having trouble making a career and family function despite having no real financial constraints, yet they still can't do it. I suppose this should make the rest of us feel better, but I found it quite depressing."
4,Excellant,"Call it ""nu-metal"" if you like... this band really have something distinctive about them, and categorisation ultimately subtracts, rather than enhances.The voice is excellant - sometimes singing, sometimes the odd bit of shouting. The guitars work well together. Everything is played to the hilt, and invested with a passionate intensity. The tunes motor along with quite frenetic energy and occasional use of odd time-signatures to keep you on your toes.The album gets off to a blistering start - with the wonderful ""I'll Find You"" - and just keeps on going. Highlights include ""Falter"", ""Silver"", ""Dissolve"" and ""If I Coluld"".I coluld hardly disagree more with the previous correspondent, whose head appears to be where the sun don't shine."
2,Urgh...,"This month has its fair share of disappointments, but this one surely takes the biscuit. This is guitars by numbers: rock bluster pasted over a canvas which has no innovation and with the exception of the singles, no tunes either. People who buy this are a public anxious for a new straight-ahead rock band to enjoy, but they're cheating themselves. Hundred Reasons aren't ready to be a rock band for the masses: hell, they're not ready to be a rock band for a couple of their mates."
5,"Way Too funny, Not for younger children","Ok I heard this was, very funny so I rented it I loved it the starting made me laugh although I should say it's not for younger kids, Garry Shandling was very funny, a alien well totell you adults you'll like it i did enjoy."
4,Interesting take on music Erasure was born to cover,"While I am in agreement with a few other reviews that call for an Original Erasure album as necessary, I found Other People's Songs to be an altogether refreshing concept and album. The arrangements are absolutely mystical and are untouchable by any other duo or group on the market today. Erasure has held fast to a unique blend of music they helped originate and are continuing to improve as a collaboration. Other People's Songs has the feel of their previous album's ""I Say, I Say, I Say,"" and ""Cowboy"".Rather than see the songs as ""remakes"", critics should take a step back and consider how well done each effort comes across. ""When Will I See You Again"" and ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" ARE INDEED songs that should be remade, their timeless classics and Erasure puts their own staple on them that only THEY can. Solsbury Hill is a bit overrated I think, simply because it is the first single and Erasure fans have shown their support."
1,Tripe,"I will not waste many words here.Easily the worst Erasure album ever. This is quite a surprise, as ""Abba-esque"" over ten years earlier was a tour de force.Recording landmark songs by others was always likely to be a failure: they would have been far better advised to pick songs which lent themselves to new interpretations rather than just imposing a style upon the original concepts.The only good point regarding this album is it reminds one that Erasure are good composers. Without their own songs, their production and vocal skills are not nearly as impressive."
3,Classic Erasure production,"Interesting song selection makes this disc worthwhile. Poppy '80s electronic sound will be retro delight for some... but becomes somewhat tiresome as disc continues, especially the last track ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" which is the only song that does not provide a fresh take on the original. Erasure fans should enjoy this collection."
4,Bought as gift,"Was a gift for my dad who fancies himself a magician, he seemed to really like it. Only gave it 4 since it wasn't for me so who knows if its perfect or not."
1,BEWARE: SYNTHESIZED JAZZ BAND. ZERO STARS,"There is no mention on the cover of the CD (and thus, not surprisingly, on Amazon's page) that on the Stravinsky and the Artie Shaw, THE ACCOMPANIMENT IS A SYNTHESIZER intended to sound like a jazz band, but it just sounds awful.This was a nasty surprise. I've written to the label asking for a refund, because the CD is not (technically) defective and thus I have no cause to blame Amazon.Amazon allows 1 star as the minimum. I would give this zero stars for false advertising."
4,Brick is great for hardcore fans.,"I saw this box set and nearly fainted, a Talking heads box of all their Byrne era studio albums remastered in 5.1 surround with bonus tracks and videos. Well, this is a great box set. The only real drawback is the price, it seems like it was padded a bit. The other reviews said that the 5.1 wasn't working on their players but it works fine on mine. So in the end if you're a hardcore fan (you probably already have this)then it's worth it, but for the casual listener, save $50 and get the old releases."
2,Content excellent but hard to rip,"The music is awesome, the bonus tracks are great, and the dvd features are pretty cool- HOWEVER, Duel Discs are excruciatingly difficult to rip to your computer. Some take hours per disc and you'll get skips in the tracks occasionally but some computers can't even rip them at all. BE WARNED!"
5,For us visual types,"For those of us who are more visually oriented, this was just the ticket. Very clear and concise. You could read it all the way through or use it as you need it. A useful resource to have by your computer."
4,Imaginative & entertaining,"For the toddler just beginning to use their imagination, this book gives just enough rhythmic rhyme to get them started. The illustrations are fun and my 18-month old daughter just couldn't put it down."
4,One of the best Hardware's for an Animator,"I'm so glad to have bought this off Amazon for three reasons. I got it cheaper than the price stated on the Wacom site, the shipping was free and I got it in 4 days from the day I bought it under the ""free shipping"" plan.Cintiqs are some of the best hardware floating around the market for animators and artists alike. With the real time feel of drawing right on the Screen and softwares that support the Wacom's pressure sensitive and tilt features, this is a boon to the industry.I would love to give this product a 5/5 for everything but I think it loses a star only because of its high price."
4,Money well spent,"It is what we expected. Nail polish seems to be good quality. Stickers are fun, but do come off fairly easily. Definitely worth the money."
1,Nail Dryer Does Not Work,"We set up the nail dryer and it worked for about 10 seconds. Its all my daughter asked Santa for, and she was deeply disappointed."
1,Cheap quality,Pretty cheap. Bought for my niece who loves to do nails. Fake nails came off before she was able to put them all on.
2,ok ?,hi i got this and i think that it is ok and the nail polishes take FOREVER to dry i got this a couple of years ago not today. the dryer is nice.
5,Lego explore My first builder game,Lego explore My first builder game.I bought this for my grandson for Christmas. He loves playing with Lego blocks
3,"Simple engaging story, with a strange, unrelated epilog","A simple story about a WWII vet who retires to a private island off of Fiji after a successful business career and unexpectedly runs into a Japanese WWII vet with whom he has unfinished business.Reckoning ensues.Overall, a well told story of a guy thinking back on the events that shaped his life.And then strangely, after the story is complete the author tacks on a unrelated and somewhat misogynistic rant in the ""epilog"" (women don't belong in the workplace - they used to be on a pedestal, people these days have sex without getting married, America is going to hell in a handbasket, yadda yadda)."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on.,"This book has so much biased and erroneous information, I would highly recommend anyone who is REALLY SERIOUS to consider ""The History of Karate"" by Tetsuhiro Hokama. There are so many other books far superior this was not just a waste of money ~ but a disappointment."
3,Unfortunate flaws,"This book has great potential to be a serious exploration of the history and traditions of Okinawan karate. Unfortunately (as had been repeatedly mentioned by others) this pompous author is unable to resist tainting the book with personal bias and baseless conjecture.The authors' research method seems to have included showing-up un-announced, and without recommendation, at various dojo and asking probing questions about the background of the school and its instructors. This suggests an acute lack of sensitivity toward Okinawan/Japanese culture and manners.When this faux-pas resulted in a cool reception or otherwise reticient attitude on the part of his subjects, these people were presented in a negative light by the author. It seems that nothing short of immediate and full access to family and dojo genealogies, a demonstration of technique and an invitation to dinner were necessary to earn a favourable review!"
3,DOES A TREE GROW IN RED HOOK?,I didn't know that Red Hook is a district in New York City until I read this book which I liked. I say that because I do not read much fiction and am not a good judge. I read this all the way through which is good for me and denotes an interesting story. The flavor of a distressed neighborhood and the makeup of its citizens and geographical setting is really well done by the author. The story will hold your interest
1,"Unconvincing, poorly written, would-be thriller","I had expected a lot more of this work, but was terribly disappointed. I'd been told it was both a good read and a literary novel, but it was in fact neither, being both poorly written and plodding. It was also incredibly unconvincing. The details struck me as all wrong, more like the work of someone slumming rather a writer actually acquainted with the scene of which he writes. Give this one a miss. Your time could be much better spent."
3,Thanx,Thanx for the speedy service.I wouldn't say the cd was Lisa's 'very best' but there were a few good songs!
4,The Very Best??? You Betcha!!!,"That's right you freaky freaks! This CD encompasses the finest creative output by Lisa ""Ear"" Loeb. It's kewl because it's got that one song from her first album, and then it's got another good song from another album, but you only have to buy one CD! And you don't get all the shplange from the complete albums that you don't want to hear. She looks nice and harmless, but I still am kind of afraid that she would smack me if I didn't buy her CDs, so you better believe I buy 'em!!! Peace out! Stay Young!!!!!"
3,About average results,"I've used the patch for 2 months now. I've had an 11 pound loss the first month, and a 12 pound loss the second month. That's better than I did on any oral diet aids. I did have a rash from the patch, but I do have an adhesive allergy. I'll continue to use the patch. For me, it's alot easier than trying to remember to take a pill 30 minutes before I eat."
2,ill stick to low carb diets,"Ive been using these for 4 weeks and I look nothing more like a patch work, with itchy reddish brown jag-ged squares all over my body,there are 10 packets of ""stickers"" in the box, and you're to stick them on different parts of your body with a new one every 3 days,Sticking them on was fun, taking them off was hair raising, they werent like band aids that come with friendly adhesives, I had to rub liquid soap and warm water to take them off and they would leave a mark. They were there no matter how much I exfoliated my skin and when I peeled it off at one go, it left a scar like the first one already did,I just hope the scar will fade off someday.I lost about 3.5 pounds in total,but its a lousy tradeoff for looking like a patchwork.Im sticking to low carb diets."
3,Dark Eyes Review,"I enjoyed this album very much.It had been many years since I last heard Alien and that was their self-titled album.I popped it in and wasn't real sure about it right away.Was so used to hearing them 20 years ago.But like most people,you come back to it and then really started to enjoy it.I think they put a lot of heart into this album and it shows.Little heavier on the vocals and it also shows that they have matured in their craft.I recommend it to anyone who buys and builds their collections by all the albums an artist has,good or bad.It is a very solid and powerful album with great vocals and creative energy.Only wish I could find second album,Shiftin' Gears.Then my Alien library would be complete."
4,Too Heavy,"The quality of the suit not withstanding, it is much too heavy for me to wear. I am sorry I bought it."
2,Eh. So-So.,"I'm probably going to take this one back or sell it elsewhere. I stopped it about 16 minutes in. It seems to jump all over the place...there's no continuity or sequence to the exercises. I also didn't like the lack of symmetry; he didn't do the same exercise on both sides. That's just a personal thing, though.I fell in love with Basic Taebo, and this is such a departure. It's too dancy, too many complicated moves and steps that I just couldn't get."
4,Nice Pace - Good workout,I enjoyed this video tremendously. He keeps it at a faster pace throughout the entire video. It felt like I was flying through the workout. I didn't get bored with it. No floor work. There were some new combination moves that were a little tough for me to remember without him reminding what to do next. Overall I think it's a great workout and I will use it frequently.
4,Just ok,"I really can't say anything good or bad about this one. It was just average. I've done many of his workouts & this one just seemed kind of bland to me. I don't think I've been able to finish it yet- not because it's too hard, but because it just doesn't grab my attention."
3,OK but more of the same,"I have been doing Tae Bo for 12 years and wanted to try a new one. I was looking for a straight cardio workout that was shorter than some of his others (like the old Advanced tapes that I still do). I wanted to like this, but it's just OK. The majority of it is just a rehash of all the old moves, with a few new ones thrown in. Then near the end he just starts doing a bunch of hard-to-follow combinations that seem like they were thrown together because he's run out of ideas. It's a decent cardio workout, not as strenuous as some of the others, but it does the job. And the woman behind Shellie with the gorilla arms was really annoying me too."
3,"Okay, but...","I found this DVD way too easy. It's great for the morning, when I feel a little lazy or I am running late, but I really don't feel very sore afterwards. I prefer the advanced workouts- I can manage the advanced DVD without too much trouble, and I am not in great shape. I think I am going to give it to my mom, who has never done Tae Bo before. It's a good place to start.The music seems to have improved also (but only slightly)- in the older videos, it was some weird drum machine stuff. I'm sure it is pricey to buy the rights to songs, but come on now- this guy has an empire, surely he could do better?On the brighter side, he is such a lovable goof- he motivates you and makes you laugh sometimes because he can be a bit cheesy and over the top. But I am trying to purchase more workouts, so he must be doing something right."
4,kicks my butt,dvd plays great and im glad that i own a workout video that really helps me get back after months of laziness or to keep my muscles in shape
1,Not the purfume expected,My husband usually buys L'Air Du Temps every year for Christmas. This was NOT that purfume. It is horrible. Smells like bug spray.
1,0 star. Terrible. Do not rent this.,"Trailer looked good. Looking for SYFY, action and special effects. Got 0, nothing. Even women aren't all that hot. Just forget this one."
3,Oh no the alien lightning storm is gonna get ya!,"This will entertain you IF you are bored enough. It's worth a buck at redbox, maybe. Not worth the time. Just kind of a 'meh' movie. And the ending was kind of lame to say the least. It was a good idea in theory but turned out to be a bit cheesy at times with terrible dialogue to boot. I had high expectations and anticipated this movie coming out after seeing the preview, but I was let down tremendously. There are better movies out there. If I were you? I wouldn't spend an hour watching 'The Darkest Hour.'"
3,Just okay...barely,"I bought this movie in 3D (not from Amazon) before having seen any reviews, but had second thoughts about it so also rented it from Redbox to watch just in case. I've seen worse movies, but this one was pretty bad. Stupid dialogue, overacting, and crap aliens. I liked the kooky electrician, but he got dead. (Oops, spoiler alert.) I also didn't mind the guy with the vest made out of keys; he was interesting, but had stupid dialogue, too."
2,"Low,low,low,low budget film","Could have been a good movie, but it fell flat! Aliens that you can not see? Even then it could have made it if the ending was better."
3,The Darkest Hour,"A movie that had lots of potential, but somehow went wrong. Looking at the reviews, I thought this was going to be another good movie that gets nothing but troll reviews saying how bad it was, when in reality it's an awesome movie. This time, I was wrong. The first twenty minutes are okay, especially right after people start dieing. Then, everything gets boring. There's a couple interesting scenes, and the special effects are really good, but it's just not a movie I could see anyone really getting into. I'm not going to call this the worst move ever, but I will say it's not worth buying, or watching more than once. If you wish to see this, rent it first. I watched the whole movie and just could not enjoy it."
1,truly awful,What else can I say? Acting was terrible. Script was terrible. Production was terrible. I've not a good thing to say about this terrible movie.
2,It is the darkest hour,"This is allright, I watched it under prime so it was free and it was worth exactly what I paid for it and not a dime more"
1,Russian Ghostbusters,"I was half expecting the Russians to yell ""Wolverines!"" when they were shooting the ""aliens"". Who walks around with a jacket made of keys? Did he just have that laying around? What is the moment when one realizes, Yea! the Aliens can't kill me if I make a sweater vest of keys! And bye the way if the alien apocalypse happens in your part of town, don't worry, because any random guy in a submarine can whip you up an extra Microwave gun in about 3 to 4 minutes.... y'know to kill an alien or cook some hot-pockets."
4,love the squeek squeek,"My daughter got this toy when she was seven months old and two months later she is still playing with it. She loves the clacking noises it makes when you shake it and she loves to carry it around by it's hand in her mouth while she crawls. I was worried that this toy might come apart but it's held up to my daughter's abuse. It is a little hard (solid wood), so it can cause damage when thrown. Luckily she's hit the dog only once with it. As a parent I have to say it's great to have a more ""classic"" toy made of wood that doesn't light up or make noises. My daughter prefers this over any noisy plastic toys."
3,Baby Loves this,"My 6-month-old loved this even before he was able to hold it on his own. The arms swing around and make a clacking noise when you turn it, and he likes that he can hold it on his own now. I hate that I have to worry about the beads coming off, and I wouldn't buy it again now that I realize what a choking hazard it could be. However, it's sad because he really does love this toy."
2,3 good songs and a lot of garbage,"This effort is very uneven to say the least. It's far from Motörhead's finest and the only good songs are ""Slow dance"", ""Stay out of jail"" (could easily been included on ""Overkill""), and the title track ""We are Motorhead"" (very similar to ""Ace of spades""). The rest is not good at all, and the opener ""See me burning"" is just awful. The cover of Sex Pistols' ""God save the queen"" is forgettable. Lemmy have said that the band usually spend two weeks writing the songs for each album, and from listening to this release, I would suggest they put a little more time as well as effort in that department."
3,"3,5 STARS",This album is a little better than average. Because i love classic Motorhead this album is not of their best but not so bad as 1916 or Snake bite love. I dont really know if you are gonna like it . I guess if you are a huge Motorhead fan you will like it a little.
4,"Best Album since ""Sacrifice""","Motorhead's new release ""We are Motorhead"" is a return to brutality for the band. Gone are the standard rock or blues riffs, and in there place is that buzzsaw sound we all know and love. This is easily their heaviest album since ""Sacrifice"". The opening track ""See me Burning"" is a rapid fire scorcher featuring that classic double bass drum thunder heard in other Motorhead thrashers. Most songs are uptempo, and Phil Campbells leadwork sounds spontaneous, and top-notch. The closing track ""We are Motorhead"" is an instant classic and one of the best ""theme-songs"" I've heard from ANY band. The only weak point (and this is minor) is the production. While not awful, the guitars sound like they needed to be mixed higher,as the overall sound is a little bottom heavy. Still, a must have for Motorhead fans, as well as fans of loud rock/metal."
1,Counterfeit Pulltap's - Garbage,"Bought this because I used to wait tables and loved the Pulltap's corkscrew that I had. It took me a while to figure out that this was a counterfeit.1) The foil cutter is dull and works very poorly,2) The worm isn't teflon, but it is painted to appear to be teflon, and it squeaks like mad going into a cork.3) The stainless part doesn't carry the engraved Pulltap's logoThere are a ton of really cruddy copies of the Pulltap's corkscrew from China being sold on the internet. If you want a proper Pulltap's, don't order from Amazon. Get it somewhere local if you can. If you cannot find locally, I might order from wine enthusiast - at least I would trust it not to be a counterfeit product if ordered from them - but they are too expensive, really."
1,Not As Pictured / Named,"The Picture clearly shows the name Pulltap on the chrome and the Product descrition name is Pulltap's --- yet when I received the item its the same generic version I bought for $3The Pulltap brand version is far superior and that is what I assumed I was ordering based on 1. Description/name 2. PictureThis product is not the ""real"" brand item as the picture/description indicates -- the seller is decieving usIf you are searching for the generic version order from someone else for less -- don't give a dishonest vendor your bussiness"
2,Wine Enthusiast,"The corkscrew works well, however, I was surprised and disappointed to see there was a winery logo embossed on it. I never would have ordered this item had I known about the logo. This type of thing should be clearly stated in the add."
1,Not Good - with white powder mark stay on cloth,I have been using liquid detergent in the past and this is the first time I am trying with powder detergent and I am very disappointed. because many times I would see white spot from the powder stay on the washed cloth. I will switch back with liquid detergent for sure.
5,Wow,"I'm very impressed with this product. It cleans so well, but doesn't leave a scent on my clothes. Great for people who don't like the scents or that have allergies. I bought the powder for myself but the rest of the family has been buying the liquid. Good value on the multipack too."
2,Top Loading Washing Machine,My top loading machine doesn't really do the best job dissolving this detergent. I find little white dots of powder residue on almost everything everytime and have to rewash several items. Test this first yourself with a small box instead of the larger purchase.
5,Gran tamaño por un gran precio!,"Diseñado para las personas de gran estatura (1,90 m), buen grosor, un reloj relativamente pesado, diseño sencillo y elegante sin mucho detalle. 100% recomendado!"
3,One of King's better efforts,"I enjoyed this story about an extraordinary young girl born of parents with odd telekenetic powers. King's style is in good form here and the trademark elements of his writing are evident: the compelling, deep characterization and the way he can inspire a sense of horror without having to write endless pages of gore."
4,A great read for conspiracy theorists.,"Like The Stand, Firestarter is a great read for conspiracy theorists suspicious of U.S. government agency activities. In Firestarter, King draws upon real-world events such as the CIA's early LSD experiments to lend a modicum of authenticity to this yarn."
2,Kindle version has big problems,"The Kindle version of Firestarter is the sloppiest print-to-e translation I've seen so far. I have done some of these conversions myself so I know that the scanner sometimes mis-reads a word or a few letters. That's what spellcheck is for. Also proofreading. This ebook contains so many uncorrected ""typos"" that at times it's hard to read. Some examples: cata instead of cars, wooda instead of woods, hone instead of horse, itay instead of stay, capital L at the end of a sentence (the scanner sees the small l plus the period as a capital), and random periods in the middle of sentences or words. Not all of these would be picked up on spellcheck (hone is, after all, a word) but many of them would."
5,U'll adore the girl!,"Reading this book U'll experience a plunge in the dramatic desperation of a girl with a monstrous and letal power. This cute and innocent creature is fighting for her life and her father. U would help her, U'll feel her power, U'll suggest her what to do, and U'll feel her same sadness.WO"
2,lacks sparks of greatness,"boy meets girl during an experiment. they later get married and have a kid. the man turns out to have a certain ability, but it's the kid that really has a ""gift"". she can start fires by will alone. the family is under surveillance by an agency. one day they by misfortune kill the woman. the man and the child is forced to escape and hide. this is the story about how they manage (i won't give anym more away). actually, i liked the father and his ability much more than the kid. there is an indian here having a large role, that i never appreciated. this is a thriller, carried out ok. what i found sad, was that it really didn't have anything to recommend it. usually, SK gives you something, but this simply doesn't. plot:mediocre. descriptions:can't even remember them. characters:uninteresting. psychology:strangely absent (to be king, he is usually better). events: mostly not that interesting. etc."
4,A Pretty Good Read,"Firestarter is an exiting thriller by Stephen King. This is not his best work but it is fun to read. This book follows a father and daughter that are escaping a government organization. The daughter is the ""firestarter"" and can create fire just by thinking about it. I suggest you read this book because it's a fun read and a relatively quick one. There are a few slow points that I wasn't interested in. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone that is thinking about reading it."
4,"Characters are well done, as with all King novels.","I always get very caught up in the characters in a King novel. Yes, he does deal with the supernatural, but I think the characters handle these events in a very real way. This book cried out for a sequel; after rooting for Charlie, you want to know what happens to her."
3,A good horror,"This is a good, staple for new Stephen King Fans- the tension is gradual, climbing to a peak and then plummeting. Good for a rainy day."
3,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Love Stephen King's books.What impressed me: Firestarter delved a lot deeper into the how and why of Charlie's pyrokinesis that the original movie did. I found myself a lot more interested in the characters that I was when I watched the movie. There were some truly horrifying scenes, but mostly, the book worked because of King's ability to get deep into the psyche of his characters, which translates better on the page than on the screen.What disappointed me: Firestarter kind of dragged on and on and on, when it really wasn't necessary for the plot. Charlie was held captive for quite some time and the reader is shown a lot of that - even though more often than not, she was uncommunicative and not really doing much of anything.Recommended: Eh, not really. I'd suggest just watching the movie instead."
4,Go Tae-Bo,"I am a true Tae-Bo fan but am not always thrilled with every dvd. Not the case with Get Celeb Fit - Sculpt. I love...love, love this dvd!! It reminds more of the live workouts of the late 90's that contained a lot of cardio while working you muscles. I have over 15 Tae-Bo dvd's but I can't seem to take this one out of the player. I workout to Celeb Sculp several times a week. I also enjoy that the arm sculpting portion is relatively short and near the end (I never find these moves to be of much benefit in any of the series and prefer to do resistance training to work on these muscles groups). This is a winner!"
3,Good & Bad,The Amazon service is excellent. This was shipped USPS and arrived very quickly. It was well packaged and arrived in excellent condition. That is the good part. The ink cartridges work just fine but contain a small amount of ink. That is HP's way of giving you the shaft. The printer itself is fairly inexpensive but the markup on the ink cartridges is where they stick it to you. That is the bad part. One of the factors to consider in making a printer purchase is the cost of replacement cartridges. If you go with a HP just be sure you don't bend over.
4,lesbian background music,Up-to-date background music with an exciting touch of lesbian chick. A major step forward for the cause of furthering womyn's and lesbian rights.
2,No Lyrics,I completely agree with the Long Beach customer. There's really only 2 good songs. Vocally they are quite talented but they can't seem to put it together as a mature group. If they're trying to be the Jodeci--they can't pull it off cuz they're not as good and they're trying to hard. It just seems like there's been no growth from they're 1st album.
5,What A CD!,"This cd is awsome! The best songs are ""Wifey"",""Jerk"", ""What You Want"". It's a great cd, buy it!"
3,NEXT LEVEL,THE ALBUM IS OK KIND OF FUTURISTIC BUT DOESN'T COMPARE TO THE FIRST ONE....WHICH WAS A CLASSIC
3,Dry pleasure,"Something doesn't feel right when so many senior officers are ordered away on vacation-- and Rostnikov *knows* that something's wrong when one of his fellow vacationers dies suspiciously. All trails in this mystery set in the last days of the USSR lead to a problem larger than simple homicide...Well-written, but ultimately not compelling."
2,Demo Not A Demo,"""Spirit In The Sky"" on Disc #2 is the same length as Disc #1, 4:01 mins., and is not 3:02 mins. as stated on rear of CD case. When both are simultaneously played, they sound indentical and sync perfectly. This (missing) demo track was the reason why I purchased this CD set."
4,This was a great game but there could have been cooler stuff,The game was fun and everything. But there was only one code that I could even uderstand. the book had a couple of typos but it was good. I woul have been better if it were in color.
2,Journal,I was disappointed in this item - It was not the quality I expected. The pages didn't appear to be secure - they looked as if they would fall out easily with repeated page turning and the cover was too hard. I expected it to feel more like leather. I returned it.
5,Flesh and Blood or a Ghost?,"Is Contance a real live flesh and blood woman, or a ghost who is haunting an old house? The minister in town determines to find out. Unfortunately, he had been out of town when Constance bought the house and moved in. He quickly finds out she's real!Constance had been rich, but was now improverished, but is determined to make a go of making a tea house out of her ""haunted house""!"
1,Hated it,"I found the premise of this book to be totally unbelievable. Maybe I am too ""cosmopolitan,"" but I find it impossible to believe that in the mid-1990s, the setting for this book, a father would kick out of the house and stop speaking to a daughter who, apparently at least 30 years old, becomes pregnant and decides to have the child. In addition, we are expected to believe the whole town condemns her and her ""loose morals"" and character deficits. We're also expected to believe this same man would leave his most treasured possessions to a man who has little, if any, respect and affection for him, and that he would suggest this same man to be his ""illegitimate"" granddaughter's legal guardian! What a bunch of hogwash."
5,There back! And better than ever!!!,"I first had to be sure that this was the purchase that was worth the wait, and this was definitely worth the wait! I didn't really see what the worry was all about in the first place.Granted, you do notice that there is an absence of one individual, (Kevin Richardson) but you can't barely tell that there is one voice missing in the background. But the voices sound just a great as they did, when they last appeared together.If you haven't bought this album yet, you are going to have a hard time convincing me otherwise why you haven't!"
2,could be better,"this is a must for any decapitated fan that loves the band to death. however dont expect to be watching the live concert more than once, or even the whole way through. the camera men that taped the show all decided to catch Parkinson's disease before they went to work.they do everything they possibly can to ruin it. from horrible camera angles to constant zooming in and out. if there is a cool guitar solo, you wont see it. if they ""focus"" on the drummer, it wont be on the drums that hes playing on.the only thing that saves this dvd from being a complete waste of time is the fact that they interview vitec alot. they give some kinds of background info on the band, but nothing real in depth.even if your a hardcore decapitated fan you should think twice about buying this dvd."
2,Not so much,"well, this is inexpensive, but , really, not worth the money or effort. get another better one, like the wowee speaker for a little more money, with shipping, this one really isnt cheap anymore. and the other one works really well, especially, for audio books."
2,"Written almost experimentally, it falls flat.","Abse's ""Dr Simmonds"" was a boring novel that is thankfully short(about 180 pages). Most of the novel takes place through the diary entries of Dr. Simmonds, who is an Anti-Semite and has a noticable dark side that becomes darker once he becomes attracted to the wife of one of his patients."
1,Annoying..,"I liked the size and weight, but the tip is so squishy that the metal barrel taps the screen when I use it."
4,Size runs small,"I should have listened to a couple of other reviews and ordered a size bigger ( I can still squeeze into it, but feel a bit self conscious at the pool). Other than that it's a great suit for the price"
4,Good value,Great value. Fits well. Too several days to hear from the seller which had me wondering but it finally arrived.
3,Percorsi purchase,"The book was advertised as ""new"" and admittedly was in good shape but did have scribbles penned in on the margins."
2,"Not the Lipton ""Orange Gardens"" that you had in the hotel","I had the most wonderful orange spice tea in a hotel recently and even took some bags home to enjoy. It was Lipton Orange Gardens. I ordered this orange herbal thinking it was the same one but it is not even close. Although the ingredients look the same this one is like water compared to the deep rich orange spice tea I got from the hotel. I went to the Lipton site and there are several orange teas and the one called Orange Gardens is under the food service section available to hotels and other food services like cruises etc.. I did find it searching on Google though and it looks like it is available from one company. If you like very weak mild flavored tea then this orange herbal is for you. It's not bad it's just way to weak for my taste. If you like a strong aromatic, robust and very tasty tea look for the Orange Gardens it is amazing!"
4,Great Childrens Movie,"My Grandson loves this movie and watches it a lot. It is a great quality product, received on time and I would buy again."
4,A Refreshing Tea Alternative,"I don't remember when we first discovered this tea, but it's been a really long time! We usually keep at least half a dozen boxes of this tea in the pantry as we want to make sure we don't run out.The tea has a distinctive spicy orange flavor which we enjoy especially in the afternoons with some refreshments. I have noticed that a slightly longer steeping time is probably a good idea; we'll usually give it about 6-8 minutes before we serve it.If you enjoy a tea break this tea is an excellent choice!"
3,"DECENT PRODUCT - boring sound, big size","This was a large product, appropriate for school-age kids not toddlers. Boring medium-pitch sound might be a blessing for parents, I was disappointed it did not have a deep tribal sound like a conga."
2,Cozy but snags easily,"This robe is cozy and fits nicely. However, it snags very easily. I have very old towels and wash cloths that don't fray this easily. I had an old terry cloth robe that did not snag much and lasted until it became threadbare. I will wear this new robe until it looks ugly but would not buy a ""plush"" terry robe again...the loops tear too easily in very normal/light use."
3,Less than impressed.,Disappointed. Product is not the quality I anticipated for this price range. Material is much lighter weight than others in this price category and the fit and finish are average at best.
1,Yawn....,"If you wanted to conpare this book to a feature in the Goldstein-edited Village Voice, it would have to be Michael Musto's gossip column rather than the more thoughful social/political analysis of people like Nat Hentoff.Sadly, there's a lot of bitchy personal attacks and parlour psychologising (which will guarantee plenty of attention in the gay press), but little serious engagement with ideas. The only ""attack queer""on offer in this book is Goldstein himself.This is another volume for people looking to have their existing prejudices confirmed, but it adds nothing to rational debate."
2,Did not like it,Very hard to read and could not get into reading it. Would recommend that if you are looking for an Amy Carmichael book to look for a different one then this
5,Got replacement disks,I bought this box set too and noticed the track errors - no Kill As One demos!! But I emailed someone at ryko and they sent me replacement discs. The box set is awesome. You can email rykodisc here: earful@rykodisc.com
3,Not bad!,"The music is good, but it's just not as good visually as many of the other Baby Einstein videos. It didn't hold my sons attention as well!"
1,Dear God what happened?,"I've always LOVED the heavy, grunge side of silverchair. When Diorama came out it took me by surprise with the new sound and it was hard to get used to but after awhile I thought it was GREAT..definitely a more mature album. But Young Modern..? They've officially gone way too far. This album isn't just NOT GOOD, it's downright annoying most of the time. Straight Lines is just OK, not good..and the rest of this is utter garbage. It makes the new Hoobastank cd look good, and that was up until now the worst rock cd of the decade."
4,Feministi vocals rock!,"As you might have noticed the reviews for Young Modern here on Amazon fall into two categories. People who love the album and people who are angry that Silverchair are not rocking out like they did on their first 3 albums. So feminist vocals from a guy who used to rock are not well received by his old fans. That's understandable to an extent. I urge all new listeners to give this album a go. It's catchy, poppy, young and modern."
5,"Are you listening, or are you faithless like the others?","Young Modern is original, spontaneous, and fun.Waiting All Day, Reflections of a Sound, The Man That Knew Too Much, All Across the World.Mind Reader.....""You're not a private detective, take off your telephone shoes"".Thieving Birds and Young Modern Station!!!!!!!!!!After getting kind of tired of the same old, this album has definitely rejuvinated my love of music.""That's all that I want to do, just keep coming up with new, interesting things, and remain inspired, and stay in love with music. Don't get complacent and don't just sit comfortably on the ideas you've already got and milk them. It's better to use them once and then move on.""Daniel Johns"
3,bad production,i have all the queers records and i love them all.this one has good songs but the vocals seem to get drowned out on alot of the tracks.thats the only problem i have with the disc.otherwise another good record from joe.
3,Predictable,"I enjoyed this movie for what it was...yes, predictable, a no-brainer...you won't be on the edge of your seat wondering how it will turn out...but it was a sweet film and entertaining."
1,DOn't bother,NOt a great movie. Waste of time and a waste of money for everyine involved. I am bummed that i bothered
2,Adult Disney fare,"I wasn't expecting much - I rented it simply because of Colin Firth.It's nice, it's what Disney/Touchstone are coming up with for their adult audience.But the idea that a broken-hearted man falls in love again, so quickly and almost without questioning his lost love bothers me -- can we go in and out of love that easily?Minnie Driver is very good in a catty diva type of character.Rent it but don't buy it."
2,What the ****,"I stumbled across this movie on my INDEMAND program from my satelite company. I was so excited to learn there was a Colin Firth romantic comedy that I had not seen. I have loved Colin since I first saw him in Pride and Prejudice in high school. (now my fav movie).This movie was such a disspointment. Heahter Grahm is just insipid in this role, and absoulutly does not fit with Colin's character. There were a few funny scenes, but in general the plot made no sense. Their was no explination for most of the events, and no reason for half of them. Skip this one and watch one of his better movies (I suggest a period peice"
1,horrible,"Going into the movie, I expected more than I received. I like Colin Firth and Minnie Driver, but they seemed miscast along side Heather Graham. Nothing really fit with this movie. The storyline was lame; Heather's character did not make sense, nor was she any good; there were too many holes in the storyline. Those are only a few of the problems. This movie was just plain awful. One of the worst I have ever seen. Save yourself the anguish."
3,Colin Firth fans will ike it,This certainly wasn't a great movie but it was fun. There was lots of Colin Firth and some very tomantic scenes that made my heart flutter but only because I think he is probably the sexiest man alive. Story wise it was not great but who cares? Colin Firth is so immensely appealing that one could watch him read the phone book and still enjoy it if only for the eview.
1,What a waste!,"I needed a ""feel good"" film tonight. This one triggered a number of emotions but ""good"" was not among them. Embarrassment. Impatience. Frustration. Disappointment. Anger. Boredom. Yes! This farcical romantic comedy was neither romantic nor comical. I never cracked a smile. Nevertheless, I was determined to endure it to the end - all the while hoping against ""Hope"" that the dashing Mr. Darcy would eventually make an appearance. He did not. Instead, this impostor develops a midlife mismatched infatuation with a ditz no where near his equal in gravitas. Even the conclusion is ponderously tedious. The next time I notice that 30 percent of the reviewers give a film just a single star, I'll save my time and my money."
2,Thank Goodness He Got The Zipper Unstuck,This is my least favorite Alice studio album. The early 80's albums defied the mainstream and it is a shame that albums like Dada and Special Forces were overlooked. However this in my opinion is a poor effort. Listen to stuff like No Bologna Homosapiens and you'll see what I mean. The album goes all over the place and just can't seem to decide what it wants to be. If you are purchasing the early 80's albums buy this one last.
1,Wrong item,"Searched universal remote control garage door openers, This one came up. It is not a UNIVERSAL garage door opener. Cost too great to return because of handling fee and return postage. File 13, from now on look very carefully at small print."
4,Works well when it eventually gets there,"The opener is easy to program and use. Can't complain about the product at all. The delivery however took a week longer than anticipated, but the blame lies more with the delivery service than anything. If I needed another one I'd get this again."
5,Good remote!,I ordered this remote because the new door opener I had installed only came with one remote! I was able to buy the opener through Amazon for about half the price the dealer was asking and it is the exact same product! It was delivered in a timely manner and works great!!
5,Great product with a great price 371LM remote control,I want to brag on amazon.com/open door remote company for providing us an extra remote control for only $16 when our greedy garage door company wanted a whopping $40 for us to get an extra opener for our teenage daughter even though we wrote him a check for $1000 for him to install the door and new opener. People are so greedy sometimes! The opener was easy to program in about a minute but I had to get a step stool to reach the motor to press the learn button. Product arrived within a week in new condition and the battery is still going strong now after 7 months so far! Great service.
4,Liftmaster 371LM review,I ordered two of these garage door openers when my wife and I bought a new house. They work flawlessly with the craftsman opener in the garage. Very easy to program.
3,Second opener,When we purchased this house we only got one remote for the garage and needed a second as we could not get the programmable one in our car to work with this opener.
5,garage remote review,"This is my first time ordering through Amazon and I must admit it is great, the product was exactly as described and I will definitely be making more purchases in the very near future."
4,Garage door opener,Received item quickly. Works great but you have to be within 30 feet of the garage door before remote works. Had hoped to activate at least from 100 feet away like my other remote.
5,Happy Camper,"I recently built a new garage and the contractor installed this Chamberlain Pro garage door opener. When I tried to find an additional remote, I discovered that I would have to find a local vendor, so I checked Amazon. I found the door opener for less than half the retail price and the reviews were very good. I ordered mine, Free Shipping, and they arrived within a week. They work great, it took less than 5 minutes to program both and the range is great. I highly recommend this item and this vendor."
4,Works Great...Had to Reset My Unit 1st,"It took me about 3 weeks of contacting Chamberline asking why my unit would not program the LiftMaster clickers.They referred me to an ""Authorized Dealer"" to come out and program my clickers for $350...In the end I had a neighbor electrician who came over...he disconnected the AC & DC power, pushed the circuit breaker, & then reconnected power. Once he had ""Reset"" the gate opening unit, the clickers programmed great!The seller tried his best to help problem solve also...I was very grateful for this.In the end, Product is great and works to spec!Words of Wisdom...Just make sure to reset your unit if you have any issues with programming your clickers.Cheers ~ :)"
5,Perfect extra opener,"Needed an extra opener with one button, price was right and it works well with my door opener. Programmed correctly the first time."
4,LiftMaster Remote,"Exactly what I needed at a good cost. Took some time to get here, in fact, the package passed through the same sort facility, just a few miles from my house, twice before it arrived."
5,"Works great, programs easily",This remote is simple and easy to program. It's light and stays on visor without dragging the visor down. I'd buy it again.
5,Great Garage Door Opener,This garage door opener is exactly what I needed. It's simple and matches the color of my car and now I have a second opener. Great product!
4,Agassi Story - Story of Agassi Family,I was kind of expecting an Andre Agassi biography but this book is actually Mike Agassi's story of his family and extended family. I found it interesting to see their rise from poor conditions in Iran to the top of the tennis world.
4,The Mike and Andre Story,"This book is ostensibly the biography of Mike, but really ends up about how he raised a star tennis player, Andre. Nevertheless, I liked it. However, if you are not a tennis fan or at the very least and Andre fan, then this book is not for you."
2,not much more than a train reading,this a very modest summary on brancusi's works. it's rather superficial and at times it's wasted on tangents of little value--such as the reference to brancusi's sexuality.i gave it 2 stars mostly for the photo reproductions.
2,Trash,"Don't even bother - unless you are desperate for a specific dose of nostalgia - there are only two great songs here, and one of them is repeated three times."
2,Burning Flame...,"Is the primary reason I bought this album as a download. I have to say the mp3 transfer is EXTREMLY LOW QUALITY. The version here is the one I remember from MTV and my 45rpm vinyl single. There is another one available, however, on the ""Sharp Stone Rain"" CD. The version of ""Burning Flame"" on SSR is a different mix and longer (4:09 vs. 3:49), but if you can find the CD the transfer quality is much higher and I recommend that version over this by a mile.db"
2,Not durable,"We've had these for 2-3 years. I love the concept, and they are very handy. However, they are not built to last. I have 4 strips, and today am having to epoxy the magnets back onto all but 4 containers. The magnetic strips have also separated from the metal backing."
3,"Great Idea, but form over function","The containers are very handy, but are definately not air tight and do not preserve the spices."
5,The best way to be an informed reader,"Thank you Jay S. Cohen. I love the way he is not trying to sell you on his idea. He takes responsibility of educating you on facts from both sides of the medical field. Very informative! I suffered from a stroke which was caused by an embolism, yet we do not know where the clot came from. My neuroligist and doctors want me to take medicine 1. to prevent migraine which I have been suffering 2. for cholesterol. I'm 41 years old, and just didn't to start taking the medication that could have lots of side effects. I'm thinking of long term. I currently do not take any medicines. I still take children's medication if I need something. I stared on magnesium and B vitamins to start and feeling pretty good. I'm just thankful for Mr Cohen giving me the information so I can be an advicate in my health care. I will be sure to pass this along to others. Thank you! Thank you!"
1,Cardo Scala700,I had to return 2 Scala700 bluetooth devices because I found both the original as well as its replacement to be defective.
2,Challenged in a Convertible,"Pros: small and comfortable; quiet in low ambient noiseCons: noisy at speeds; fiddly to put onLooking for a Bluetooth headset I could use driving in my convertible, I researched and bought several last summer. The Cardo Scala 700 was great in the house, but not so good in the car, which is my primary use (thus biasing my rating). I put up a page with some MP3 noise tests at http://SeizeTruth.com/Tech/CellPhoneHeadsets"
4,Good Headset,"I choose this headset based on a recomendation from a friend mainly for its flexible ear hook. It allows you to bend the ear loop to fit exactly to your ear. Once fitted, it stays on secure and I cannot shake it off my head on purpose or accidental. The sound quailty is good for me and the caller. The noise cancellation works good too. It has all the standard features you would expect in a headset. The headset is also very light, so wearing it for etended periods of time is no issue. Overall it does a great job and for the price I paid on Amazon, you cant go wrong."
3,Adequate Bluetooth Headset,I tried several headsets before settling for the Cardo Scala 700. All headsets are relatively week and have low volume. They are particularly poor in loud environments. The interior volume is high in my cars (on the high performance side) and people usually have difficulty hearing me at highway speeds. I also have difficulty hearing the other party but to a lesser degree. The Cardo is as good as few of the others and better than some. It is adequate and acceptable in a product field that leaves much to be dsired and its price is in the middle. The features are sparse but sufficient for the general purpose. It is light and comfortable despite its simple design.
2,wow,"its like basically it doesnt work for me. i cant adjust it right, then the people i talk to always complain about hearing backround noise. i really needed to find my bluetooth one night and i tried the calling someone else and using the volume key and that didnt work so i had to find my bluetooth and it was hard tryin to do that."
3,"I purchased 2, mixed reviews....","I bought 2 of these ear pieces. Mine works fine, but my girlfriend's doesn't work at all. I plan on returning it and getting another one because I like the small size and the easy set up of the Cardo 700. I upgraded from the Cardo 500 that I bought in March of 2007 (I still use it to this day- a great buy) and the 500 has worked through all sorts of weather and conditions (I'm a police officer and a member of the Air National Guard.)All in all, if you get one that works, it's great."
2,Bluetooth,"I have tried 4 different bluetooth models/makes. Some in the $25 range all the way up to $100. The bottom line is fit and sound. I have not found one that has both benefits, and I have had one just quit. This model while functional and easy to use was floppy on the ear and one of my least favorites. It has been frustrating, when most of the cell phones are free or nearly so and the bluetooth sets while not that expensive, are such a small piece of hardware for the price. Not pleased. I think it is the latest rip off in the personal electronics market."
2,Keep Looking,"Very flimsy, cheap product. Takes 8 seconds MINIMUM to turn On/Off. Battery life only a couple days. I sure expected better from the previous reviews."
3,Satisfied,I am generally satisfied with this earpiece. It connected well with my Blackberry. Overall very satisfied. Only complaint is that it is not as loud as other earpieces.Still for the price it is a good earpiece.
4,A Classic CD....,"This album is a work of absolute greatness. Just about every single song is fabulous. There are a few uneven points, like, for instance, ""Yard,"" which in my opinion was a bit too draggy. And the lyrics are sort of... um.... how to say this.... enigmatic. There we go. Despite this, this is one damn damn fine album. It somehow manages to straddle the line between their earlier Boys Next Door records, their major Stooges influence, AND their later gradual metamorphosis into 80's goth rock heroes (as seen on Mutiny and The Bad Seed.) The good massively outweighs the bad in this case, though, and I highly recommend this work to anyone who has not heard the Birthday Party before. A very good introduction to either Hee Haw or Mutiny/The Bad Seed, and probably the best place to start with the Birthday Party. (P.S.: The 'Explicit Lyrics' label is very misleading. I don't know who put it on there, but it doesn't belong. The lyrics are too enigmatic to be 'explicit' anyway.)"
4,disappointed,"I bought the My Firs Leappad for my 2 year old son who is advanced. he enjoyed and did not treat it rough-no scrathces! However, it only lasted 10 months! The computer started making weird noises and kept saying that the cartridges were not for this system. I am very disappointed and he gets really frustrated. I am not happy that this product only lasted this long especially since we have bought several books. He is now 3 and I am considering buying another leappad system or the power touch."
2,I was disappointed,My mother bought this system for my 3 yr old . I we have had problems since . The voice sometimes doesn't come on or it just makes a humming noise . So I finally threw it out. I will never buy another leappad product again.
2,A lot of money for a little bank,"I have three children ages 3-9. Not one of them has enjoyed this product. Actually, my youngest does but only to tear the pages out of the books. If you have money to burn, it is a product worth trying. Otherwise, it is not worth the cost. There are so many other products that help teach that are far less expensive. Some take more one-on-one time, but kids benefit from that. Seriously evaluate this product before buying it otherwise it could be just one more thing to dust around the house."
3,"good learning softwear, but, too many glitches","I really liked our leap-pad at first. My daughter played with it a lot, but it seems as time goes on it acts crazier and crazier. For instance, if she bumps the cartrige even a little, it says ""this is not a leap pad cartridge"" and turns off. Sometimes, even if I just changed the batteries, it will just turn off by itself when my daughter is playing. She hardly plays with it anymore because it frustrates her so much and I never know if it is draining the batteries or if it is something else. It does have a good set of learning softwear, if we could only use it!"
4,"Fun, but breaks easily","We have this Leappad. We are on our second one and I refuse to buy a third. We have kept each leappad put away on a high shelf when not in use, and have kept the books and cartridges put away as well. While this toy has been much enjoyed, it quickly stops working. The pen starts misreading words or simply stops recognizing what page the user is on. Also, we had a cartridge that stopped working after it was used several times. This is not a durable toy for kids (mine is 5), even when cared well for. By the time you invest in all the books, you feel compelled to buy another leappad once the original one breaks. I, for one, will never buy another leap frog product again after my experience with this poor quality."
2,Durability is poor,"While the educational value of this toy is OK, the durability of the pens is so poor that the product is not worth buying. If the pen breaks after 90 days, you have to buy a new one (only a few dollars but still). Many people are frustrated and do not understand why their leappad is acting strange, well it is probably the pen."
1,Doesn't last very well,"It's a reasonably educational toy, but be careful because it will break quickly... and if it does, you only have a 3 month grace period! We used it carefully and it still started working erratically after only about 6 months... that's $15/month! What a waste."
3,but do they play with it,"I have three boys 1,4 and 6 and this toy stays in the closet. It's a nice idea and the 1 year old loves to hear it talk, but they don't actually want to sit down and learn from it. My neighbors say the same thing about it. I thought if we bought more books and gave them more options, they would use it more, but they do not. Think twice before buying this item, kids at this age don't want to play alone with a toy. I would have given it a 5 star rating, but to be educational, kids have to play with it. It is durable, my one year old can't break it, even while chewing on the pencil."
3,Money,I think this item is a good educational toy but the only problem is the price ...it is a bit expensive for a book that will help you learn to read that is a good idea to make a book that will help you to learn to read but not as many people will want their child to learn to read at that expense
3,Breaks too often to enjoy,"This is a great toy in theory. If only it would work. My daughter is NOT hard on her toys, but the pen broke. I called LeapFrog and they wanted $7.95 for a new pen. They sent a new pen (this time with a stress relief) but then another part of the toy broke. After more than an hour on the phone with LeapFrog, they decided to send me a new pad. With the new pad came an older style pen (no stress relief) and it turns on at full volume every time. We have many, many books/cartridges and they are fun and educational, but this toy is just not made to stand up to even the most careful child's use. Now, I'm waiting for the pen to break again. I do not look forward to another call to LeapFrog -- the company you have to fuss with to have them stand by their toys."
1,Complaint against Amazon,"Amazon advertises My First LeapPad software on this page, even though it is not compatible with the LeapPad learning system."
5,"A must have, but be careful with the pen!","This is a truly wonderful educational toy that is fun and easy to use. It engages my daughter, who is 3, and keeps her involved for long periods of time. It is also easy for her to navigate the various books and work with them, as the instructions are the same for each one. The main drawback to this product is the pen - the wire it is attached to the book with is pretty stiff and it's hard to get it to lay just right when the lid is snapped closed. I have a friend who got the wire stuck outside the book and ended up breaking it (it can't be fixed, apparently) after very little use. Also, it drains batteries fairly quickly and you really need to snap the batteries in place firmly. I would also suggest getting the backpack to store it - the books and cartridges are easy to lose!"
2,Save your money. Read them books,"I bought this toy on an auction site well below retail prices. I really don't see what the fuss is about. I think it's a waist of plastic & paper.The books have very limited value from an educational stand point.If you want a sound effects box (electronic babysitter) that your child can mindlessly play with then this is the toy for you.I normally love Leapfrog, but I really believe they missed the mark with this toy. I will be putting our toy immediately back up for auction."
1,Didn't work,Bought LeapPad but I found out as usual. LeapFrog is a cheapskate. LeapFrog did not provide batteries as do most toymakers. Result was poor quality control because had LeapFrog installed batteries LeapFrog would have discovered that the battery compartment was missing parts so that the LeapPad did not work.
1,Not reliable,"I bought five of these for my new house about 3 years ago. I am now replacing the last of them with passage door sets. They worked well for a while but then one of them caught on the strike plate and we had to take the lock apart to open the door. I have replaced three for this reason. Now I am replacing the last two because when you go to open the door the lock part pulls out and you have to push it back in every time. These locks are a good idea, but they are just not reliable."
5,Fiction about Cyber,"I really enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down because it was easy to read. Although the author says this is fiction, it was very believable. Stormy Steele did an excellent job with her first novel, and I look forward to reading her next book."
4,"Fascinating, disturbing, and uplifting","A very well written and well documented account of a period in the life of a jazz legend, Bud Powell. Francis Paudras' sincere and humane relationship with Bud Powell is evident throughout the book. Great quotes from other musicians and friends in Bud Powell's life. Although I knew the ultimate fate of Bud Powell, the ending is very disturbing. I have many questions that I would like to ask Mr. Paudras. It is shame that he is no longer with us. An excellent book."
1,We laughed over this one,"Every month my ""girl"" friends get together on Saturday afternoon. We usually set one topic for discussion over wine and snacks (men, fashion, movies, books, and stuff like that). This time, we decided to talk about decorating, so we brought in magazines and books. One neighbor brought this book and passed it around and that's when the chuckles began. It started with the funny cover of the ""luxurious"" room with the one round seat in it. From there, we laughed over a lot of the rooms that are so uncomfortable or ""stiff"" looking . We decided to rename this book ""Funeral Parlor Design"" or ""Decorating for the Old Folks Home."" It definitely isn't about the comfort my friends and I crave."
4,"Better than average, but not up to his ussual standard","I read ""Strike zone"", Q-squared, Vendetta, and Imzadi, They all had one thing in common, they were mind-blowing and you learnt something about star trek. But, with thr captains daughter it was just an ordinary enjoyable novel. I hope new frontier wiil be bette"
5,Peter David is a Master!,One of the best Trek novels I've ever read -- David fleshes out characters like Demora Sulu and Captain Harriman so well that I'd love to read more about them. David is hands down the best Star Trek writer around today. A must-read.
3,translation fine- decent but not great formatting,"this is a review for the kindle product.i can handle an average translation, since i know a little bit of french and have access to translate.google.com and my own imagination.what i *can't* handle is stupid formatting. luckily, this book (for the kindle) has decent formatting. it's not too difficult to figure out what is going on most of the time. no where near what i would consider ideal (or really what a person should be getting considering what he is paying)- but not impossible.having received so many impossibly formatted kindle books (especially in the bilingual poetry section) in the past, i am relieved at least to see a half-assed job done at this point.really amazon- think about it a little. would you sell a paper book that had bizarre formatting? no, probably not. so why sell an ebook like that?fix the formatting and this book will get AT LEAST a 4 star review."
5,Definitely Different and Familiar,"In what can only be explained as an awakening of musical exchanges and ideas, Nikki Sixx and cast deliver an extrordinary package. It delves into a dark genre, much darker than any Motley Crue song including Primal Scream could ever dream. Nikki expands his horizons and truly comes into his own as a singer/songwriter. If you are expecting a typical Crue album consisting of songs about drugs and girls in scantally clad garments you will be sadly dissapointed. However, if you are interested in what Nikki can acomplish when free of the limitations of Motley Crue than this is the album for you. I only wish more of today's singer/songwriters could take a note from this extrordinary expression. Dig deep, deeper than you thought possible and start creating some real music again. This is a must album for anyone who happens to be a fan of Nikki Sixx and for that matter any true music lover."
4,"From anger to inspiration, a philosophical voyage","Patsy Powell moves us with her very personal account of a bitter conflict with the educational establishment in Central Louisiana. Her devastating testimony condemns the entire ""good ole boy"" system which perpetuates the status quo in a very conservative area. No one is spared. Principals, fellow teachers, students, parents, school board members and even her not so loyal attorney share her critical appraisal. Being from the area, it was easy to change the names and know exactly about whom Mrs. Powell was writing. It remains to be seen whether out of state readers will share in the same pleasure. Mrs. Powell paints a somber tableau, not only of those around her, but sometimes of herself as well. As the story progresses, the angry elements fall away and the inspirational core shines through. A courageous account by anyone's standards. Keep writing, Patsy!"
2,Rotten Apples.....Angry at the world are we?,"I have to say that this book reads like a see-saw. There is no coherence to the book at all. It skips from childhood to adulthood to college back again to childhood. Very hard to follow her. She might want to recheck her records of what she writes in her book. I was one of the ones listed and I can tell you by first-acount that the stories written were, at best, lucid,false accounts from the author. In her psychomaniacal way she paints this story as ""poor me"" tribulation. The title to this book should be ""swiss cheese"" as there are a million holes in this account of the authors life."
2,Very Christian in viewpoint,"If you, like myself, tear up at the end of ""Touched by an Angel"" episodes and are a professed Christian, this may just be the book for you. I was surprised by the reviews that the ""surrender to Christ"" aspect of this book was not emphasized; if you are not theistic in the sense of God intervening in your life, this book will be of little existential help. Let me tell you the plot: God and the belief in Jesus will sustain you in this life, and if you are imaginative enough, you can see God making people's lives better all the time, and hence, ""why worry?"" If you are reasonably convinced that consciousness as we now know it does not survive death and are looking for some insight to allay the fears that belief brings, you need not apply here."
4,Came as promised,"The DVD I ordered came as promised and in good condition. However, the plastic it was wrapped in was all dusty and got some dust inside the DVD case. Then again, it was an older movie from the 90's probably stored somewhere for a while."
5,Little Women,"I mistakenly rated this a 5 star before realizing this is the version I returned,did not want, and ordered the one with the cast of the original I saw, starring Margaret O'Brien, June Allyson, Liz Taylor, etc., which in my memory rated a 5. I am waiting for time to view it when I will not be interrupted by caregiving for an ill family member. Thank you."
3,"A pretty good movie, except . . . .","Having seen all versions of the movie and having loved the book, I would have given this a higher rating except that the mis-casting of Clare Danes really spoiled this movie for me. I thought Winona Ryder did a credible job and comparisons with Katherine Hepburn and June Allyson would be inevitable. Susan Sarandon was good as the mother too. But, who in the world cast Clare Danes as Beth! She's too big, too tall, there's nothing frail about her. In one scene where she is laying in bed, her legs and ankles look like giant Sequoias. Her acting is nothing to brag about either. If another version is made, please read the book and the descriptions of the characters."
5,Heartwarming!,"Finally, a classic story brought to life! The most recent version of ""Little Women"" illustrates the true meaning of Louisa Alcott's timeless novel that stresses the importance of strong family ties and the true meaning of love. Christian Bale is such a talented young actor and complements the fine cast. Great!"
3,Not Entirely faithful To Book But It's Good Anyway!,"This is the 1994 movie adaptation of the wonderful Louisa May Alcott book Little Women and despite not being entirely faithful to the book with liberties being made with the plot I still liked this movie and I think the cast is good, Susan Sarandon as Marmee and Trini Alvardo, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst as her daughters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy and Christian Bale as Laurie and Eric Stoltz as his teacher John and Gabriel Byrne who I thought was a great Professor Baher and very handsome! This is a lovely, sweet movie and I higly recommend this DVD!"
3,Ok..........,"The movie all in all was ok, but definitely does not go hand in hand with the book. I absolutely love the book and was let down by the movie. Some of my favorite parts were left out and I felt that the movie was compacted and rushed."
5,Best Movie Ever,"This is a truly heart warming story of four sisters turning from children into ""little women"" durung the 1860s. It's as good if not better than the novel. They let you in in their joys and hardships. Winona Ryder is truly amazing as Jo, and seems to capture her character perfectly. It's a also a very good proformance by Christian Bale as Laurie, the boy next door. He makes it seem as though he really is Theodore Lawrence."
4,Worth it for the grade A cast,"I hope I'm not spoiling anything here, but Claire Danes' death scene is the most touching one I've ever seen. Everyone is doing some seriously great acting here. This is a family movie, children can see it, too :)"
5,Delightful Interpretation of the Timeless Classic,"To be honest I was a bit wary of watching another ""remake"" of Louisa May Alcott's book ""Little Women."" I had seen the versions with Kate Hepburn, June Allyson and the NBC television version with Susan Dey. However upon a friend's urging I checked this version out from the library to watch. After viewing the movie all I can say is this is a delightful interpretation of the timeless classic. The movie was well cast, scripted,directed and scored. The movie flows flawlessly from beginning to end. I have no idea why this movie was given a PG rating it is definitely a ""family film."" This movie is a great follow up to reading the classic story."
3,Where are the directions?,"I am a teacher and found this book on the author's website when I was searching for origami links. While the picture book is a great introduction to the art of origami, I had assumed there would be directions included to create the origami animals the little boy in the book made in the story. I was disappointed that no directions were included, nor were they available on the author's website. As a story book, it is beautiful though."
5,Hard To Put Down,"I found Eye On The Horizon to be a rigorous adventure without personally breaking a sweat....In fact, I had a hard time putting it down once I started reading it. Mr. Eye's description of the AT was thorough, but not tedious. After having time to digest it, I found his message to reach beyond that of a manual (albeit helpful) for hiking and nature enthusiasts, but to motivate those to live their dream regardless of self-perceived limitations. I look forward to reading Eye's next book."
4,Good snow shovel for the money,"These shovels were available when everyone else was out, for 36.04 + 10.77 S&H (I ordered 2). After a few uses, they seem to be as good as new, with no sign of wear yet on the wear strip. The steel core handle is an advantage; durability should exceed that of the wooden ones, which tend to weather, and the unreinforced ones, which jacknife too easily. The shovel part has a scoop shape, which holds more snow that other kinds. Shipping wasn't lightning fast, but reasonable; I ordered December 21, 2007, shipping estimate was Dec 24-26, actual was Dec 27. UPS uncharacteristically misrouted the package, with delivery on Jan 2 instead of Dec 28. Ironically, it's a 40 minute drive from the original shipping point to my house. Overall I give the product a good recommendation."
5,"Snowcast 20"" snow/pusher",I bought two of them this winter. I used them for cleaning roofs due to the very hard winter in Maine. They worked great! I would recommend them.Jeff
5,Great book by one of the foremost theorist on war,"First the price is right, FREE. Second whether you consider yourself a Jominian or a Clausewitzian you have to read them both to understand what puts you in the other camp. Jomini has been used since the French Revolution to today and was used extensively in the US Civil War. Again a great read and much easier than Calusewitz On War."
3,Good Book,A classic military read for anyone who that is interested in tactics. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to learn more.
5,The Art of Life,"The Art of War (which I own several versions and copies)I believe should a primer for all people who wish to be in businessconduct relationships of any type and in general to be in this world.The process is simple, everyone is trying to make this planet a great place a FOR THEM to liveyou need to be aware of the implication of surface and deep structure of language, of actions and of intention."
3,Size matters.,"The valance is advertised as 48 inches wide. It is barely 44 inches. Quality is ok, not worth the price. I would return them but I don't have time to find anything else for the kitchen window. Rather disappointed."
3,Live in Detroit,"Frampton can still kick it out, is the short version. And he's developed a mature irony to go along with his chops. The version of ""Do You Feel Like We Do"" rocks as titanically as the _Alive_ version did. But this one includes a rollicking, funky piano breakdown, as well as a more boisterous bass line. The crowd roars in anticipation of the by now familiar climaxes, but they still sound fresh, nonetheless. And Frampton is on to himself as rock dinosaur, never taking himself too seriously. At one point, during the talkbox section, he even breaks into a little Austin Powers routine. ""Yeah, baybee!"" A treat!"
4,A Great Historical Read,"This book offers a great retelling of the 1912 election and the personalities involved. The book is light on analysis, but rich with historical details and stories to drive the narrative forward. Although the race featured four candidates, it was unlike the other serious four candidate election of the 20th century, 1948. In that year, the full political spectrum was represented by Thurmond, Dewey, Truman, and Wallace. In 1912, the fight was over who was the most progressive. Even the incumbent, President Taft, had some progressive credentials despite being the conservative in the race. If the book has a failing, it is putting a bit too much stock in the long shot candidacy of Eugene Debs. If anything, Debs could have played spoiler, but did not have a serious shot at the White House."
4,Good book,The book has a lot of info though the game is so extencive that at times it may be hard to find the info you want.
3,"A bit outdated, but still helpful.","While this guide is helpful in certain aspects, it is a bit outdated as to be expected with any guide covering a mmorpg. By the time I got my hands on it, several placements for collectors were listed wrong. Still, I do like the guide as it has helpful hints and tips for beginning players and covers PVP play (but keep in mind that changes too)."
3,Not bad but Not Great,I've never held much hope for the John Payne era Asia CD's but this one surprised me. There's enough good material on it to rate 3 stars.
2,"Not Bad,...But Not That Good Either","Silent Nation is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Though I enjoy tracks such as ""Ghost in the Mirror"" and ""Long Way From Home"", most of the rest of the disc is just plain mediocre. Most of the songs simply collapse under the immense weight of Payne's dark, foreboding and pretentious lyrics. Musically it ranges from clever and melodic to morose and dull. After purchasing this cd when it first came out, I gave it many listens but for the most part it has remained on the shelf. Frankly, Payne's overwrought, hair-metal vocalizing hurts as well. Asia's earlier effort ""Aura"" was a far better effort and has aged well. It's great to see John Wetton, Carl Palmer and Steve Howe back in the fold. Hopefully, on their new cd, Asia will again give us the classic, prog-pop sound that made them a household name over 25 years ago!"
5,Amazing !!,"It has been a little over 3 years since Asias' last studio CD and it has been well worth the wait ! Asia has recorded by far thier best Cd since ""Alpha"". Sure thier have been some excellent Cd's after ""Alpha"" (Aqua,Aria,Arena and the most recent Aura), but ""Silent Nation"" has the sound and feel what Asia fans have come to love over the past 20 years. Songs like ""What About Love"", ""Ghost In The Mirror"", ""Silent Nation"", ""Midnight"" and ""Long Way From Home"" are so reminiscent of the Asia of the 80's that it's hard not to enjoy this record. So do yourself a favor and pick up the strongest Asia album in years."
3,Poor old NY Philharmonic,"What did they do to deserve Mehta, Masur, and Maazel, all in a row? These Mahler readings, of which only the song cycle is actually compelling, are dogged run throughs, the work of a virtuosic orchestra led briskly through its paces. Of true Mahler feeling there is very little. The sound is glaring and shallow, too.Altogether, a sad reminder of a long era in which a great orchestra has lacked anything close to inspired conducting. Like everyone who loved the NY Phil. from the Bernstein days, I can only wish them much better days to come--but Maazel has signed up for another five years, so their salvation won't happen any time soon. Meanwhile, they still sound great and do wonderful work, especially when their resident conductor isn't around."
2,Hitachi Camcorder Purchase Review,The camera is ok but sometimes it just is not worth the technology because the disks have had errors while recording and after recording (two different types of formats). At least with the 8mm we used to use we knew what we had. I sure wish I had an 8 mm instead.
1,Love the Look but it's Peeling,Wanted a sturdy colander that looked nice enough to leave out. It's a nice size and handles are helpful. This looked good at first but found that after a year or so the finish started peeling off. We've only hand washed it and don't use it every day. Expected it to wear better.
3,Ok,"I was surprised that the items arrived dirty. Although, at first i did not look like something that could be cleaned. With some elbow grease, the dirt on the handles, rims and inside the colander were able to be cleaned. The colanders work just as they should after a thorough washing."
5,Black colander 2,Have been looking for a black enameled colander for 3 years andfinally found one (actually 3 different sizes).
5,A Delightful Blend,"A wonderful blend of present day characters, Chaucer's characters and a history of Medieval Europe and the Catholic Church. Ellis's blend of American Indian mysticism adds to Chaucer's journey to Canterbury as he meets a variety of people along the way. What was a long and dangerous journey in Chaucer's day is completed by Ellis with hikes through London and the countryside with stops in fields and at bed and breakfasts. Strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys reading about history, travelogues, or gaining a better understanding of Chaucer."
5,They deserved so much more,"With popular music little more than an overproduced, homogenized mess these days, it's even more heartbreaking to realize that a band with such great hooks, harmonies, and songwriting never got its due. The Reivers had it & delivered -- jangly melodies, evocative lyrics, and the ability to tell stories & evoke landscapes of memories with seeming ease. There's a warmth to their music, a homespun flavor that reminds the listener of old times, old friends, lost dreams & treasured moments. Criminally overlooked in their own brief lifetime, they're deserving of rediscovery by anyone interested in quality songwriting by a superb band. This one can be played over & over without ever growing tired or old. While I consider this their single finest album, all four are well worth getting. Most highly recommended!"
3,John B Stetson as Horatio Alger,"This is a biography of the famous American hatter John B. Stetson, 1830-1906, written for young readers. As a former teacher and a father of two, I estimate the reading level as late elementary school. The book is very much in the style of biographies written for children of this age. It's the old work hard, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, American success story. I recommend the book for all aspiring hat entrepreneurs under 13 and over 10."
3,Somewhat recognizable.,Somewhat recognizable entries of herpetology by Hobart M. Smith. He seems somewhat experienced in advanced herpetology and does not hesitate to document it in this guide.
4,Awesome,"It looks pretty good,a lot of customizable parts to choose from,but the only problem is it would probably look better if the camera was like in Armored Core, because in Custom Robo the controls are screwed because the stupid camera is at an angle and your too far away to see your Robo in most battles. What's the point in customizing if you can't see the bot? Anywho, it would probably be better if the Other Robots would react if you attacked.You shoot there health just goes down.Not alot of explosins, or any getting blown to the other side.This game could use a few touch ups,but other than that,it's a great game.Good story,and weapons"
4,S'good.,"It is by NO means deep, but it's a fun game, if only for one play through. The beep-beep-boop style of dialogue WILL get on your nerves (you'll know what I mean), but the game play is tight and fun and the music is catchy. All-in-all, a fun game."
3,Custom Robo review from a 13 year old who played it,Its a good game to get but it gets a bit repetitive.I like this game because as u continue u get some real cool stuff it also is kinda funny and actually teaches a little bit about what could happen to the world if we dont learn from history.
1,Book,I have still failed to recieve the Book Geosystems: An Intoduction to Physical Geography. This is the only book that i have not yet recieved out of the books i have ordered. It has been 2 months and still no book. I will be asking for a full refund if the book is not in my possession by the end of this month.Thank you. . . Very Concerned Customer
4,Nats 1201,This book will be a great value to me in my NATS class. This book came with the Atlas in the same box but was not damaged like the Atlas. I look forward to using this book in class.
1,Horrible Text,"Poorly written and organized. One of the worst texts I have had for a class, it makes things more confusing instead of explaining. It covers many topics instead of explaining anything in detail."
3,geosystems a study guide,very good conditionjust like it said it would bevery pleased with the book itself it will be very useful in months to comeit did take longer than it said it would to reach me but cant help that.
4,Geosystems book,"Good condition, came with online code and CD for other studying purposes.Good deal for the good condition of the book.Thanks!"
3,Geosystems/Sixth Edition,"Good Book! Lots of good illustrations and examples, with an overubundance of current world data, and concepts. This book would be great to use in conjunction with classroom lectures for a sixteen week or full semester course, so that you have an opportunity to absorb pertinent material. With the amount of information in this book I would not recommend its' use for a short eight week internet course."
2,Going through the motions,"First let me say that Cale is one of my very favourite artists: I consider him a genius. But when I saw him in 1983 (supported by Jon Richman) and in 1986 he was genuinely live, even frightening; didn't use damn lyric sheets (reminds me of Peter Hammill on VDGG's 'Paradiso' DVD) and paid attention to the audience. Here he treats the audience with disdain, as if he could barely wait to plunge through the set, do the obligatory scream or two and get a cab back to his hotel room. I've owned the Audio version of this since it was released, and trust me you're better off without the video. Cale is one of my heros, but watching this and comparing it to similar shows I saw live a decade before, it sucks."
4,in your mind's mind,"Rebeccasreads recommends MINDLINGS as a thoughtful trek into another world -- your mind -- which is ""peopled"" by the strange critters of the title.MINDLINGS is a provocative flight of fancy & philosophy about power & love, & the ""outer"" & ""inner"" worlds we live in... or not!"
3,"Cute, but small","I bought this as a gift for my nephew who is 9 months old. I was expecting to be much larger than the 5inch height it actually is. I was hoping for something that would stand on the floor and he could play with and it wouldn't fall down - I obviously didn't catch the ""Clutching Toy"" description. It turns out that this is more like a rattle. He seemed to like it to hold on to, but it wasn't a toy that I think he would play with for a long period of time. But it is a very cute toy and very durable. I'd recommend it to people who are looking for cute quiet toys that you can stick in a diaper bag."
2,not happy,The top Pokemon fell off of the stylus but otherwise it was as expected. It was delivered on time and it was fairly inexpensive so I will give it two stars.
2,no noticeable impact.,"We have a very noise phobic dog and a ""normal"" dog that only gets worried for very severe thunder and close fireworks. the phobic dog is scared of the trash truck, barely audible fireworks in the distance, highway noise, you name it he's worried about it at some point. I didn't expect this to make him brave, but it doesn't even noticeably take off the edge in any concentration. it doesn't help the normal dog either, but the things she's scared of are so big and so loud that I imagine a full tranquilizer would be the only thing that helped. I'm not sure it's reasonable to expect a difference with fireworks the next house over, but we hoped it would ease mr scardey pants off his worry about the trash truck."
4,-,i'd probably really give 3.5 stars but that's beside the point. when love is here came out i was one of the first to buy it and then no one really had any idea who starsailor was. they promised to make their follow up cd different from the first and it deffinately was. silence is easy wasn't a bad cd really; it just wasn't spectacular. i don't think follow up cd's are ever as good as debuts because by the second time around artists now have a crowd to please. popularity generally wins over creativity and starsailor proved this to be true. there were a few excellent tracks near the end but i predict that with the release of their third album starsailor will become mainstream and cultivated by society into a pop culture disaster.
2,Overrated,"This album could have been good. The tunes are ok, the lyrics are nice, no gripes on that. But the sound is very flat, it lacks depth and warmth (which is terrible for a pop album). And there is a bit too much orchestra in the background.I was much more thrilled by Turin Brakes' ""Ether Songs"", or even Moloko's ""Statues"", which both display amazing arrangments, and an outstanding sound."
2,"Great Band, Disappointing Album","I am a Starsailor fan and was completely riveted by their first album, the stunning vocals, the song-writing, the depth and diversity of subject matter and musical approaches made for a full, satisying album. Sadly, that's not the case here. While the vocals are as compelling as ever, the songs are, save two or three songs, much weaker, redundant, anemic, cliche-laden, forgettable. If you love Starsailor, then you will, as I did, buy this album, but it is clearly a mediocre shack compared to the splendid skyscraper of the first album."
5,Job's Niece,This is another great book by Grace Livingston Hill. I really enjoy the Christian theme's she brings to her books.
3,"Fun, relaxed read; needs a little polish","I enjoyed Institutionalized -- it's a fun, relaxed read with a story that moves along. There are some likeable (and some equally hateable) characters. As a whole, the book is a strongly satirical dig at corporate culture which will ring true with anyone who has worked within a large organisation -- you will also be barracking for the anti-corporate hero, hating the incumbent villains and incompetents, in no time.For me, the book lost a few points for lack of polish and subtlety -- satire doesn't need to be a sledgehammer! -- and there were some unnecessary diversions which appeared to arise from the authors' personal agendas, and should probably have been edited away.In summary, some editorial furphys slightly detract from an otherwise funny, raw, quick-moving, satirical look at corporate America."
2,"History only fair, mostly vague data, coverlet info poor","This book takes snippets from other books with no footnotes. Much of what is stated about coverlets is historically wrong. Most descriptions of coverlets and weaving history are either vague or just wrong. It is not as bad as the Knopf guide to quilts and coverlets, though."
4,Good Down to the Bone but NOT Acid Jazz,"I've been hearing Down to the Bone for years now and have all their albums. I've enjoyed them as I have rarely enjoyed music, they simply make my day.Sadly this album is not what I've been hearing in their past albums...they have turned from Acid Jazz (a mix of Funk, Jazz and Soul) to FUSION jazz (a mix of Jazz, Samba, Bossa Nova, you name it!).I gave this disc 4 stars because it does not generate the feelings the other four albums do, but it is still a very good album (I can hear the piece ""Dancing to a Samba"" a THOUSAND times and still want to hear it one more time).One thing to keep in mind is that we usually complain that artists start composing in a certain way and continue releasing albums that sound exactly the same. Maybe this change in Down to the Bone is for the future best."
4,"Good on ""What You Must Know"" - Skimpy on ""Natural Alternatives""","This is a tough subject. Some people consider statins as the ultimate wonder drug...others consider statins to be the ultimate evil drug. Lots and lots of BS in the newsgroups.Cohen does an excellent job in explaining how to use statins while minimizing the possibility of adverse side-effects. His approach makes a lot of sense.Unfortunately, there is no natural alternative ""magic bullet"". So don't expect to find any natural alternative even close to statins in effectiveness. He does weed out a couple of ineffective natural alternatives."
5,Key book for health,I have been battling high cholesterol for years now and have spent hours and hours researching the literature. I was surprised to find that this book finally told me something new! I investigated a lot of the claims in the book and the author seems to know what he is talking about. A treasure.
1,Expirded date on them realy not cool,I recieved this product late and they are nine months expired. I can not believe this. They were shipped from India so it took forever to get but to be expired are you kidding me.
1,Poorly designed,"Will not dry, does not wash well, and it makes horrible metal on metal sounds. We have had the mechanism replaced 3 times and have given up. I believe in their attempt to make a tall tub, they made the wash/pump/heat mechanism TOO small and unreliable. Our dishwasher repairman says these LG products keep him very well paid as he goes from one to the other all day. Lowes will not sell these, and shame on Home Depot or anyone else that does."
1,review of Pink Floyd,"This is a history of Pink Floyd, it is not a concert, although there are pieces of songs in it. There are stuffy British journalists venting their opinions of the group. I felt I paid way too much for way too little Floyd.I could care less about what some nose in the air journalist thinks, I want to see and hear Pink Floyd when I pay my money!"
1,Echoes The Best Of Pink Floyd 2 CD Set 26 Remastered Tracks,"Echoes 2 CD Set Is the best of both Of these Items"" 2 1/2 Hours Of their greatest music. Sequenced by the band as one continuous experience.Give Echoes 10 Stars"
4,Great product for the most part.,I really like this bra. Only complaint is that I'm a 38C and the XL is a bit snug (almost too tight) across my ribs and the cup part could be tighter. Overall a good product for the price.
2,Superficial,This is not a reference work and will be mildly interesting only to readers with a superficial view of the recorded music industry. Nothing new is included. I read it in 1/2 hour and now it is put away for good (until I give it away).
4,"Just like the old MTU, with better artwork","This glitzy team-up series is a worthy successor to the original 1970s version... It has a lot of the same elements -- quick action, somewhat thin plots, supervillans you don't really care that much about but look forward to seeing defeated (Titannus, the mutant kid named Paul) and lots and lots of Marvel superdudes, with Spiderman as the focal point. So far so good. The artwork by Scott Kolins is nice -- realistic, but not filled with fetishistic, super-exaggerated body-builder muscles... The introduction of an evil, alternate-reality Iron Man is fun... he's the bad guy that gives this book its bite. In short, this isn't a like a great work of art or anything, but it was a fun read. I kinda wish I hadn't spent the money on it, but I enjoyed reading it... Above-average wham-bam superhero stuff."
1,Condition of the Book,"The condition of the book was not ""Good"" and totally unacceptable. I would not purchase from this seller again - it is a library book! The name of the library is stamped on it, the bar code (on the front cover) was blacked out (so nice) and the library codes on the spine was ""X'd"" out. Paperback books sold at libraries are $.50 - $1.00 and that's what this book (that I paid over $5 for is worth! It's going back and, as previously stated, I would never buy from this seller again."
5,Robots Rule!!!,"The Robots of Dawn is a great book, so great that once you get started, you can't put it down.The planet on which the roboticide (murder of a robot) takes place is Aurora, the capital of the Spacer worlds. Elijah Baley, veteran of two other such incidents, arrives with his humanoid robot partner Daneel, and another robot, Giskard. Baley must attempt to free the man accused of the roboticide. And he interviews several people to come to a conclusion of who killed the robot. But Giskard, the seemingly unimportant robot, is a lot more than what anyone thinks"
5,mystery and Science fiction in one,"Great book. Gives great psycology of humans and robots. We see how diffrent robots ""think"". Plus it is a great who's done it. Asimov brings back a great idea from ""I, Robot"" I couldn't put it down, fonoshed it within a day. I never expected the ending, even though it was hinted to through out the book. shows the power of Asimov as an Auther. Plus their is deffinete charecter develpment througout the robot series. this future us deffintly possible. Technolgy without using thehumanity of life."
5,Nice Little Opener,"My dog chewed up my garage door opener and I did the ""push the button and run under the door"" thing for too long. Bought this opener and wondered why I waited so long. Now life is good again, I can just roll back out of the garage without the hassle of running around; don't do the push and run! Oh, you will have to take out the little Philips screw and set the switches to match the garage door opener; was easy."
2,SHOULD OF BEEN BETTER,"FIRST OF ALL THE PUPPETS WHEN THEY WERE WALKING THERE LEGS DIDNT MOVE IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE HOVERING,UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS MOVIES. LEECH WOMAN SHE DID NOTHING, JESTER DIDN`T DO MUCH EITHER APART FROM SLICE 1 COPPER IN THE HEAD WITH A KNIFE. THEY USED PARTS OF ANIMATION FROM THE OTHER 5 MOVIES. TANK PUPPET LOOKED CRAPPY, THIS PUPPET WAS A WASTE OF TIME. THERE WAS ABOUT 4 OR 5 KILLINGS FROM THE PUPPETS. LETS PUT IT THIS WAY I WAS DISSAPOINTED, IT WASN`T AS GOOD AS THE OTHER FILMS. STORY LINE WAS GOOD , BUT THE MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE."
1,What happed here?,"I have been a big fan of the Puppet Master series since part one came to video and I cann't beleive how bad this entry was. It could have been good since the production values looked decent and up to par with the others in the series. However, it was the bad acting, bad story , and boring useless characters that did this entry in."
5,"MASH, in my opinion, is the best show out there.","This is a great season, but aren't they all? This is a great item for any MASH fan, no exceptions."
4,Should have been a five star,"A terrific anti-war collection alledgedly manufactured in the good old U.S.A. BEWARE: Before slicing open the cellophane, buy quality cases to hold the three discs, because the original container is so crappy the discs will simply fall out. And, I can guarantee that, when they do, they will fall shiny side down! For some reason, ""Guerilla of My Dreams"" did not play for me , but, when I purchased a new DVD player, it did. You figure it out. Anyhow, except for the quality control issue, this was almost a great purchase."
4,Unique and Enjoyable,"I purchased this item after spending a good hour looking online for tail lights for my 2000 ford explorer. Th eother tail lights are either too pricey for the design or just plain old ugly. After seeing this one, I decided to purchase it. The item arrived shortly there after and was very easy to install. So far I have yet to see this item on any other vehicle since I purchased it and even well before that. Only issue I have with it and it might be a manufacturer defect, is that when it rains, the upper area seems to get water or like a mist in it which leads me to believe that it is not sealed properly. But it might just be an issue with mine. Aside from that, if you want tail lights that not everyone has, this is the one for you."
4,Scanner Reset & Computer reboot,"This scanner is great. Only thing I am not happy is that after around every 10 scanning (photo or negative)It locks out and asks to off & on the scanner. Then after around every 20 scans, it lockscompletely up and have to reboot the pc no two ways about it. I have Sony Vaio Digital Studio.If any body has any suggestion for this improvement please write to me Pooran9412@yahoo.comOther wise the quality is great.Prior to this I bought Epson Scanner, it was quite contrary to what the specification said. I had to return it within two days of trials & baught the Canon 5000F."
2,Spots on image,"Hello, I purchased this for christmas 2003. Right out of the box I had the same problem as ""wshiii from Philadelphia, PA"" The glass was dirty on both sides and all the images (no matter what the resolution) had white spots all over them. I will call canon tonight to see what they can do. If they cannot fix it, I will look elsewhere for a replacement"
2,dissapointing,I loved the first tribal fusions dvd but this one is too expirimental and not enough tribal..im not a big fan of the music and expected to see rachel brice or mardi love..loved sharon kiharas performances and zoe jakes are pretty good but this dvd is definitley moulan-rougey..its just different.
4,The Flintstones,"It was exactly what I expected and remember from my childhood. Perfect for the big kid at home, or within."
5,Love it,"Great christmas cartoon to have for the family. Thanks again. Really enjoying this Christmas cartoon, since they do not show it on tv."
1,Junk as a brake bleeder,"This is a fine vacuum test kit, but garbage for bleeding brakes. I could not get a tight seal around the brake bleeders no matter how much grease I used on them and the cup. The cup is also very brittle and feels like it's going to break just putting the hoses on it.I went back to my simple tube with a check valve in it and a second person pumping the brake pedal - works great. Save your money and don't bother with this kit."
2,Made in China,"It's made in China, only mentioned on the packaging, not even on Actron website. I am exchanging it for the pump made by Lisle."
2,Could be better,Purchased to bleed brakes on a motorcycle. The pump itself is pretty good and sturdy but that is were it stops. The container is too small and it is almost impossible to stop it from leaking. The amount of sealant included in the kit is laughable and not even remotely enough to use the kit once. It is hard to make any kind of connection with the various adapters that doesn't leak. I was able to get the job done but this is not a very impressive kit.
4,It's not a pump only a vacuum,This is a good product and it appears to be built well and is suited for things like bleeding breaks or siphoning out some excess fluid. However I that it had a reverse flow based on the title vacuum pump. I know silly me. It does not just in case you read into things like I do. If all your looking for is suction this is the product for you. If your looking for pressures keep on shopping.
2,Probably not in my library for very long,"The Firm Bootcamp - Maximum Calorie BurnI thought I would try this one out on Netflix before purchasing it. I'm glad I did. This one is not a keeper!The routines were uninspiring, the music unmemorable, and the camera made it hard to watch the right instructor at the right time! I just didn't care for it.That said, I do think this is a good routine for beginners or for folks just getting back into exercise. I will do it a few more times this week and then happily send it back with no regrets."
4,everybody follow Sue Mi-uggghhh!,"I just recently started using the Firm exercise videos and I consider myself in pretty good shape. This video will get your heart pumping and leave you sweating after the work-out. I agree with most reviewers in that the camera work is not very good, when it should be on the trainer it's on the modifier (Sue Mi). Oh, and it gets very annoying after the 15th time when the instructor tells you: ""for all you beginners follow:Sue Mi"" I guess she doesn't have much to say.....Other than that i really like this video and I find I get a good work-out.I am going to purchase more from this company."
2,ok for a change,"This one is OK, but still mostly boring. It's fair for just cardio, but not much on the strength training part."
4,great overall workout,"I consider myself an advanced exerciser and this had me sweating buckets! It's a great overall cardio and weight workout and the ab section at the end is wonderful. The cueing is great, and so is the music. It's also very easy to follow the beginner moves if you're new to working out or the FIRM style. Previewing it before you actually do it is helpful since some of the moves are very quick paced. I highly recommend it!"
2,An extremely silly movie,"Perhaps this movie reached new ground when it first appearred in the 1950s, but it is an unfocused, melodramatic mess by today's standards. James Dean excessively emotes; Natalie Wood, although extremely beautiful, seems to suffer from multiple personality disorder; and Sal Mineo is so obnoxious as an apparently gay kid in love with James Dean that it is difficult to care what happens to him. And the lack of communication between all of these kids and their parents seems to have no genesis, no force; it's just a plot tool. Why is this movie considered such a classic?"
2,Easy on the eye,"For my penn'orth see my comment on George Schaefer's 5* review. Find it by accessing his review of Maxwell Parrish by Eileen Myles. On 2nd thoughts, don't bother. He's probably dead now and I'll be next."
2,This was not east of eden.,"OH my god. After reading the book by john steinbeck, this movie seemed so flimsy that it was unwatchable. It is the kind of movie that you can watch for two hours whithout actually watching anything at all. sure, james dean is great but this movie is not east of eden at all. It only covers a tiny portion of the book and leaves out all of the great characters like lee and is grossly innaccurate. It was just rediculous and a huge letdown.---READ THE BOOK!---"
4,groundbreaking,"This movie is a one of a kind treasure. Given that Dean only made three movies, it is a very memorible preformance for that reason alone. I think the movie has stood the test of time and made my teenage daughter watch it. The story behind the movie is even more interesting!"
2,SO SO,"Having just finished the book, I was so excited to watch the movie adaptation. I was quite disappointed. The book is a saga. The characters that we are introduced to are the results of their past but in the movie we are only made aware of their past in passing admissions and allusions. What made Adam who he became was his relationship with his brother, his service in the army and his drifter days. Kate's past behavior was so heinous that her days as a madame were the the least of her sins.On the plus side, the acting was flawless.Sometimes it's just best to leave a book alone."
4,East of Eden,Have been checking the price out at various places for sometime. Finally Amazon reduced the price for a short period during the Christmas holidays. This was a gift to myself and was pleased.
5,Rebel rocks!,"If you are looking for a good classic movie with a star that lives up to his legend, then Rebel is the one to see. In the movie James Dean becomes a real rebel when a gang of hoodlums challenges him to a fight. All through out the movie James Dean and Natalie Wood give a wonderful performance, not to mention that James will steel your heart from the moment you lay eyes on him. This is by far my favorite James Dean movie! See it, I know that you will love it!"
4,Micro and Macro Effects of Hate,"Very good book with respect to personal struggles resulting from hate. The Macro issues of nation against nation, while informative, were not the reason I purchased the book."
4,Silkwood,"Silkwood is a gem from 1982 starring a fresh Meryl Streep and Cher. Kurt Russell also puts in a brilliant performance.Silkwood is about Karen Silkwood who decides to publicise the danger that co-workers are exposed to at a plant she works. This is brought on by contamination she has suffered while working there. Overall, a very sad film.The only annoyance is Streep's constant (repeat, constant) smoking during the film. That may have been Karen Silkwood's nature, but it seems pointless to the film.The DVD is very much worth owning. Worth owning for a snapshot of how good films were in the early 80's."
5,"Silkwood is thumbs up, Peter Alerich's review is a downer!","This is less a commentary of Silkwood, which is terrific movie highlighted by superb performances punctuated by Meryl Streep's, and more a request that Peter Alerich, who wrote a review below, never pick up a keyboard again. What surprises me is that he uses the word ironic, and that he reads. Maybe he should see the movie seven more times so he can figure out what acting really is."
1,Expensive,I was brought to this item as I searched for replacement wick for my humidifier and this seems very expensive for this item
4,Quick Service,"I ordered this product from Amazon because, after 2 visits to my local hardware store,they still couldn't get it right! Amazon provided mewith the technical details needed to get the order right and I hadthe item in 2 days. No problems whatsoever."
3,Replacement filter,"Very fast delivery. Filter sorks well. It must be turned over every 1-2 days to keep it moist. If it dries out, it may begin to grow bacteria. Rinse it at least once per week and be prepared to change it monthly. I am satisfied with the Honeywell Humidifier that I purchased it for. I would like to be able to keep the filters in the appliance for longer than a month ,but the bacteria (and filter) begins to smell like a wet dog."
4,Works,There are no magic bullets when it comes to filters for humidifiers. If you flip the filter every time you fill the tanks these filters will last longer. During the driest times of winter you can get about a month to month and a half out of one of these. That is a lot from a filter. If you do not flip then you can cut the length in half. I am happy with these filters. To also help get the tank cleaners that come two in a pack.
4,Add this to your DVD Collection...,"Love and Basketball is a beautiful film, A Must have, and a great introduction to the fine actress Sanaa Lathan.."
4,Spike Lee's Done It Again,"This album is hot.I was in the movie theatre jammin'.They went all the way back to one of my favorite groups of all time- New Edition. When I came home, the first thing I did was take out my New Edition CD, and called my mother and asked her to pick up the wonderful Love & Basketball soundtrack. The only thing I felt was missing was Donnel Jones' other song- Where I wanna be. It would have been just right for the part when Monica and Quincy broke up outside of the college"
4,"Reply to ""Missing Song""","You asked about the song in the trailer and you listed some of the lyrics. The song was originally done by Kate Bush, and the song title is ""This Woman's Work"". You can find it on the soundtrack to the TV show ""Felicity"". Hope this information helps!"
5,Soulful,"I thought the soundtrack for Love & Basketball was off the hook, I really enjoyed it, I listen to the CD all the time, if you are a real music lover, you will enjoy this CD."
3,DON'T FALL FOR IT,"This soundtrack has the potential to sizzle but only manages to fizzle as the hottest song in the movie is nowhere to be found on the soundtrack. So don't be fooled looking for ""THE SONG"". You know which one I'm talking about. The one that'll probably boost Maxwell's sales. Altough I'm not sure that it's him. But the heat from M'shell is there."
4,"A blast from the past, with a little extra !","I went to see the movie on its opening day. I really enjoyed it along with the soundtrack. It has alot of songs from ""back in the day,"" that reminded me of my high school years. The best song is ""YOU MADE A FOOL OF ME"""
5,Great cover,"This is a product that is very convient to use when I want to gowithout stockings and want to have a nice even look on my legs. I haveused other products where I had to set it with powder. This just gets puton and you're done. Doesn't come off on clothing, and even can remain onin the shower if it is not soaped off. Great product , lots of shadesare available."
1,total garbage!!!!!,"Got boots 2 weeks ago......no soft insoles!!!....whatever????. A 15 dollar pair of dr. Scholls later things are going great. Not exactly waterproof but okay. Then yesterday an eyelets ripped out while I was tying laces. $$$$$ wasted, find another brand. Thank you."
3,"More theremin, please","Tunes such as Calcutta, Caravan, and Bali Ha'i are amazing and full of theremin-goodness, but much of the rest is good lounge music with the theremin as support. Fun, interesting, kitschy, but not as much a study in the theremin as one might hope."
5,Hitchcock's Best,"RebeccaIs by far my favorite Hichcock film.It's a movie you can watch over and over again.Laurence Olivier is at his charming best and Joan Fontaine is wonderful as the confused naive newlywed.My favorite character in the movie is Mrs Danvers.Playing an obvious but unspoken lesbian""Obsessed with the late Rebecca""She is the personal maid to Miss Fontaine's character as she was to Rebecca before.She is deliciously creepy.This movie will have you confused but in an oh so good and suspenseful way.When you finally find out what is going on you are joyous in the revelation.Hichcocks camera work and style is that of cinema royalty.It did win the Oscar for best picture after all.do your self a favor and introduce yourself to Rebecca."
2,Faulty DVD,"This started out as a great movie - until around Chapter 24. Then an entire Chapter went missing! It was a key plot element that was left out, so it really affected the quality of the movie. BUMMER!"
1,Wait & See,"MGM has a reputation as being very cheap when it comes to restoring their classic films onto Blu Ray. I am suspicious of ""Rebecca"" because neither advanced copies nor information about supplement material has been provided prior to this release on Blu Ray. Wait and see. Hope for the best. I am not commenting on the film itself, it's a classic, hell I pre-ordered it. I want to see what the reviews are about the Blu Ray transfer."
5,classic,"i first saw this film when i was a teenageit has always been one of my favoritefilms, the new release on dvd has lots ofadded extras and the quality is so clear .its a must see for true movie lovers....."
3,Good sound and quality but . . .,"This drum is extremely high quality and the sound is great for the price but I find that my child was senselessly banging on a drum and then just got bored of it after a while. I think for the same price parents should consider the alternative toy ""Toysmith Parum Pum Pum Drum"". The quality on this Remo percussion is 10x better but the playtime on the Parum Pum Pum Drum is exponentially better of kids. There's more musical gadgets and doohickeys that come with the Parum Pum Drum and although it doesn't have a better drum sound, my eardrums and sanity gladly welcomes the more soother and subtle sounds."
5,The perfect drum,"I love this drum! I got it for my 1 yr old. I was looking for one with a real drum head & nice sound because I was a percussionist back in my school days & am living vicariously through my child now. I didn't think the plastic heads on the toy drums would meet my expectations. This one does. I like that it doesn't have a tinny sound, so it's not annoying or real loud. I also like the fact that it will last her for many years. It should be suited for her up through grade school at the very least, so well worth the money! And the drumsticks are durable. I like the safety of the soft mallet end. Plus, many drums have one stick. This one came with 2 so she can practice her coordination as she grows."
1,Poor Sound missing mallets,Our drum arrived missing the 2 mallets that come with it. Would have been no problem as we have mallets from a different drum. This thing sounds terrible with a ringing sound that is just too much. This was returned to AMAZON immediately for missing parts and poor quality.
5,Christmas Gift,"I got this for my two year old granddaughter for Christmas so she hasn't gotten it yet. But my own review is that this drum is made very nicely, looks and feels like a 'real' as opposed to a 'toy' drum. It came with two tom tom sticks, also very nice quality. I think this was a real bargain."
4,Good tasting,"I bought these for goodie bags for a dino themed birthday party. They candy tasted good and was loved by both children and adults. The colors are vibrant and make a great little gift. I live in the south and had them shipped when it was warm out, and they didn't melt during shipping."
5,One Reason Why DVD Players Were Built!,"The tagline for The Star Wars Special Edition Trilogy was: ""3 Reasons Why They Build Movie Theaters.""The tagline for this DVD should be: ""One Reason Why They Build DVD Players!"""
5,Bigger than Derek's Cucumber,"Perhaps the funniest non-slapstick movie ever made, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is a welcome addition to any DVD collection. Though the format has been best utilized for action and sci-fi films, this comedy DVD truly does the film justice.The transfer is exceptionally clear and crisp, with bright, vivid colors and a great sound mix. The extras are quite funny and entertaining -- very much worth your time."
4,Pseudo-documentary about dimwit band,"Spinal Tap, directed by Rob Reiner, follows a dimwit band on their tour in America. The band has a series of episodes, that do not portray them in a positive light. They are silly, and even admit they are child like. Their popularity has diminished and they need to come up with new ideas to rejuvenate the band. The film follows a young director making a documentary about them.This DVD has good transfer and sound. The extras are good as well, with a commentary with the band, out takes and more. The film itself is an effective comedy/satire of rock n roll bands from the 60's folk to 80's hair metal. I found the jokes throughout the film set up well, and one joke comes up right after another, with no dull spots, although it is not bust out loud laughing kind of humor. Fans of metal with a sense of humor should enjoy this. 4 stars. Check it out."
5,"without a doubt, the finest comedy ever...",and also the funniest. plus they sound better than most of the coq-rock bands of the '80s.
5,Incredible humor and value!,A must-have for anyone who loved the movie. The extra footage is extensive and hilarious. And the movie itself just gets funnier every time I watch it.
2,ehhh,"So many people have told me to watch this. I'm glad it was free (for Prime members) because I couldn't finish it... it was soooo boring! I can see how this would have been funny when it released in the 80s, but if you're watching it for the first time in 2012 it doesn't have the same oomph it apparently had back then. Maybe our moral standards have significantly declined, but the band's ""shocking"" behavior/thinking/etc. isn't at all shocking by today's standards. There's a scene, for instance, that I can tell is supposed to be funny wherein the record label won't release the band's new album unless the cover is changed. The ""shocking"" cover is just a woman with a dog collar on. (Insert yawn.)This is probably a great movie for fans who've been watching it since the 80s, but if you're a newbie like me... well... let's just say watch it while it's free or don't bother!"
2,Good thing this was at a low price.,"There's only one word I can say after watching this Blu-ray: Depressing!The characters are all non-entities, trying to find reason as to why they're existing in this world.Maybe the problem here is, you have to be stoned, before watching? Since I wasn't, and I don't drink either, will just put this away in my collection, never to be watched again! (Although my wife make look it over when I'm not home?)"
5,An excellent entry to a very rich garden tradition,"The best single short book introduction to the classical Chinese garden I have read - especially with respect to desired mood and intent. Well illustrated, it includes very instructive succinct items on design and exquisite quotes from Chen Fuyao's 1688 Huajing (Flower Mirror) that convey so clearly the attitude of a wealthy literatus to living in his garden over the seasons."
2,Boring and overrated - but still required for McQueen fans.,"Bullitt is the kind of movie that people like because it's popular, not because it's necessarily any good. When people talk about ""tough cop"" movies, this one always seems to come up in discussion, and invariably people will talk about the famous car chase scene. It has been called the best chase scene of all time.To be fair, the cars are pretty cool. A late 60s Mustang fastback and a Dodge Charger - the ultimate bad guy car. And yes, they do go up and down the streets of San Francisco. For about 10 minutes.The actual story has been reviewed and summarized enough on here that I won't get too into it, but it's pretty standard cop material.At any rate, for serious Steve McQueen fans, this movie is pretty much required viewing. But if you're just looking for a good action/cop movie - don't be mislead by the flashy cover art on this one. The movie is slow and boring, and the car chase is hardly worth the price of admission."
3,only one steve mcqueen,"Product quality was good. Story line a bit thin with predictable antagonists. Seem to remember a very weak and unsatisfying ending. The car chase may have been hot in its day, but it seems really ordinary by today's standards. You have to love Steve McQueen though. He even looks good in dorky pajamas."
4,Car Show,Great movie to add to your collection if you are a car buff! Forgot how great of an actor Steve was.
4,They just don't make them like this anymore,"Corny monotone lines and washed out Technicolor. Simply beautiful! Plus the greatest car chase ever! And I'm talking actual car chase with cars! Not CGI, fake cars built for the stunts, using nitrous, or any stuff like that. McQueen even does his own driving (for most of it anyway).I only complaint is that the sound track need to be remastered. It might be in Dolby, but its weak."
5,Better than Ever!,"Well,for a Movie thats 40 years old ,this Blu-Ray edition is Incredible ..if you own the Original and now your into Blu-ray ,this is A MUST HAVE ...Steve McQueen Looks Awesome ...and That Car Chase ...Phil Dantoni your the Best."
3,"A Classic Film,Cropped To Fit Your TV","This is a classic film,which deserves a five star rating.But anyone interested in seeing it as it was originally filmed may want to hold onto their older DVD copy.As Amazon notes here,Bullitt was shot in the 2.40 to 1 aspect ratio,which means there should still be the usual black bars on a 16x9 set.Instead,Warner Video cropped the ends off to fill the screen.It's still a fantastic film,and the image quality is fine,but...If I had known,I probably would not have bought it."
4,cool as a Bullitt,"Being a native San Franciscian and growing up in the 60's, this will always be my favorite cop movie because it was filmed in my home town. The movie was based on a book call ""Mute Witness"". Steve Mc Queen plays a cool and groovy unconventional cop, there is only one scene where he actually wears a tie and overcoat looking like an official Police Inspector, all other scenes show him in a turtle neck. Car chase scene is a classic and if you have a big screen television monitor, your stomach will rock when they go flying down hills. If you know the streets of San Francisco, the chase route does not make sense- but it is still cool anyways."
5,So Good,"Great movie, I will gladly recommend this movie to any and all my friends interested in a classic Steve McQueen movie"

2,A good movie but poor video quality,"This is a good movie for its age, but the video quality of the DVD is not that great. If Bonnie and Clyde can be done so well, it is around the same age, why can't they get this one right."
3,An improvement over 'Violations',"Much more better than book 4.#'s ""Violations"". I thought the writing of an alien without a face (except for a mouth) and Tuvok mind melding with him was a masterpiece. What I look for in these ST Voy books is something different and spontaneous that is not on the show, and sometimes it delivers and sometimes it doesn't. I think the idea of aliens fighting over advance technology in the DQ is something that certainly the show hasn't dealt with much. This is one of the last books set during Season 1, including the following ""Murder of the Sun""."
4,Information Correction.,"The product detail information given for this item, states that the puzzle has 750 pieces; the customer image displayed shows 550 pieces advertised on the package. I have this puzzle and my item also has 550 pieces. I want the customers to know the current information listed as of 12/29/2009 should be corrected to 550, instead of 750 pieces. The name given for this product is ""I Am With You Always, 750""; It should be 550. Thanks!"
5,Beautiful Puzzle,I haven't put this puzzle together yet but I know it will be fun to do. And it will be framed for all to see.
4,Becoming Chloe,Great book. The write captured so much of what the girl was feeling about how she had to live. I've read her other books and find each one to be a great read. The story line draws you in and you really don't want to put it down. Keep up the great work!
4,Better than I remembered (nose picking included),"My wife recently got the full frame (standard) version of this DVD and I watched it with the kids. I don't know why I had such a poor impression of it from seeing it as a kid, but I thoroughly enjoyed it as an adult! Gene Wilder is perfectly cast and the kids (as well as adults) in the movie did an excellent job. In the review before this one, lizardkingjr stated that the nose picking scene with Violet was cut from the widescreen edition. This made me feel better about my wife having gotten the standard version, because the nose picking scene was not removed from that version. I recommend this title for children and adult enjoyment."
5,The original seed!,"There are untouchable pictures through the years, movies that shine instantaneously, acquiring a kind of self life, crossing the common and accustomed commercial lands to live far beyond the rainbow.In this category, I can mention The Kid, The Gold rush, The circus, he Navigator, The cameraman, Duck soup, City lights, The little princess, Wizard of Oz, Gunga Din Fantasy, The blue angel, Miracle in 34th street, It's a wonderful life, National velvet, Great expectations, Oliver twist, Limelight, Shane, Le balloon rouge, A day, a cat, The wonderful world of the brothers Grimm, Mary Poppins, Sound of music, The never ending story, E.T., and obviously Willy Wonka, the last hobgoblin to date.Based on a children `s story by Roald Dahl, Wilder (in his best performance ever) is a very famous candy-maker who will invite to his Paradise land, to five lucky childrenA must for all the family"
5,$5 for a classic...woot!,"So i got this for my kids this xmas. I read the book when I was a kid and saw the movie. I loved it then. I saw the remake and thought ""did this really have to be remade other than for corporate greed?"" I like Jonny Depp, but didnt like the remake. After watching this with my kids and seeing how much they liked this, I think that this is still one of the best kids movie."
5,excellent service,I ordered the dvd Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory for my daughter. I received this item in less time then what I expected to arrive. This was excellent service. This movie is great.
3,Good,"This is a nice collector edition, but I'm viewing the Blu-ray version as I type and it's not a very impressive HD transfer at all. I owned the DVD version and gave it to my older sister when she was over recently so I replaced it with this. I will compare the DVD version included in this set via my PS3 which offers decent up scaling. I find many of these HD transfers are sorely lacking and it's pathetic to waste money on many of them. I'm watching the scene where they enter the magical candy land area, honestly I thought it would look breathtaking... really doesn't.The tin pencil case is great I keep my check writing pens and checkbook in it. You do get a golden ticket and the book is quite nice, lots of behind the scenes photos and info.In the end it's not bad for the money, but the star is the movie in HD and I do not think this delivers. 5 star edition. 3 star Blu-ray and that's being generous."
5,VCR tape,My granddaughter loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. She has gone thought a lot of the DVD's. they get scratched pretty easy or just break. She has had the tape a lot longer than any of the DVD's she has gone through.
5,All time favorite classic,"This is one of the all-time favorite children's classic that I grew up with. Gene Wilder is phenomenal as Willy Wonka and the story is a classic story that never grows out of style. Even as an adult, I enjoy watching this movie over and over and never tire of it. I have seen it many times on TV and still get excited to see it. This movie is a real family film that the whole family from young child to adult can enjoy together. It has a wonderful message and great scenery and story. Don't miss this opportunity to share a bit of family fun with children and adults alike."
1,Wrong Copy,"This picture clearly shows the old Willy Wonka movie, but I recieved the new one with Johnny Depp. Completely upset."
4,"wonderful, but extremely creepy","this movie is wonderful, but there are a few scenes that I would recommend you not let your younger children watch alone, like the psychadelic trip down the river, when willy's quite open about the fact that they're all going to die and horrible scenes flash by. when i was little it scared me to DEATH! other than that, it's all peachy-keen."
4,Willy Wonka--Delicious in HD!,This HD DVD comes to us 35 years after its 1971 theatrical release. It is presented in full 1920x1080 HD and delivers the goods. The picture quality is greatly improved from the DVD and pops 3D in many scenes. A definite purchase for any fan of the original Willy Wonka movie!
5,The Best Children's Film Ever Made,"This is a movie for kids and adults alike, entertaining from start to finish. Some grumpy critics are quick to note that this film, like alot of now classic films, was panned when it first ran in theatres back in the 70's. Don't listen to them, I love this film, the musical numbers are great and Gene Wilder is perfect as the mysterious and often crazy Willie Wonka. Above all, it does'nt insult you or your child's intelligence..."
5,gret service,the service and the price were fantastic that's why i give it high marks. i would recommend your product to anyone
5,Fantastic Movie,This is a classic. I do not like the remake at all!!! Can't beat this all around good family moive with good values!
1,Surely ye jest!,"$43.99 for a Blu-ray DVD?! Even a movie as awesome as this does not deserve to be priced so high. I have nothing against the film, which is a classic if ever there was one, but I do think Amazon needs to be a little more reasonable about pricing."
3,Why waste the money on the full frame version?,"This is one of my favorite films but...there is only one reason to buy this DVD. That is if for some reason you are unable to get the Wide Screen Version. This is a magnificent film, probably fits in most boomers ""all time favorite"" category. I purchased it not knowing it wouldn't be wide screen, I was horrified to see that they panned and scanned this wonderful piece of art. What idiot at the studio decided to do something like that? Buy the widescreen version and enjoy the film the way it was intended to be viewed. Then you will be in a world of pure imagination!"
3,Butchered product!!,"I saw Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory as a kid. But I am not making a sentimental review. It is a great KIDS film. I never read the books it was based on. It's exactly as I remember it. I like the dark humor that exists in the movie. The music has some standout performances. The production quality is actually still quite good compared to certain movies today. So why the 3 star rating? Because I am rating the product as a whole.I gave it three stars for the quality of the product. I prefer widescreen over fullscreen so I can see the director's vision of the movie! The WIDESCREEN DVD is not correct at all. It is the full screen version with bars on the top and bottom! Not only are you NOT GETTING the UNSEEN FOOTAGE on the left and right, but you are also LOSING the top and bottom footage! Scandalous! It is an outright problem that needs to be remedied. So you don't get what you paid for!"
2,way overrated....,"This is a bad movie -- slow, poorly directed, indifferently acted, and mostly unfunny. Any episode of ""The Sopranos"" has more to offer Mob movie fans and aficionados of black humor.Raised a star for Anjelica Huston, who delivers far and away the best performance in the film."
1,Bad.... everything really,"I have to admit I could only sit through this movie for about 45 minutes before I had to shut it off. It was that bad.First of all the acting is horrible, even Jack Nickelson and Kathleen Turner. Jack's accent is afwul and both are really flat. Lowest point is where they confess there love to each other when a band is playing. The dialogue is so bad that George Lucas' Star Wars dialogues seem written by Shakespeare.The music is great, nice classical stuff with a lot of strings. It would work wonderful in a costume drama but now it sounds like technomusic in a movie about a classical composer.Looks like you really have to be Italian to get the accent right and not have it sound so rediculous like Nicholson and also Anjelica Huston.Bad in everything, don't buy it"
4,fun gangster romance parody,"This film is one big joke: you have all the basics elements of romance (love at first sight, great passion, etc.) and gangster flicks (brutality, dagerous machinations, the mysterious don, etc.), but it is all done with the crudest humor.It's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately ""get"" or you don't. That is a matter of taste and expectations.I enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s, when Nicolson and Turner were in their primes. The acting is very good, if a bit obviously tongue-in-cheek.Recommended."
2,Scratched!,The Headphones were bad scratched on the outside of the right earcup. I am very disappointed as the scratches were quite visible.
1,Stopped working,"I've had these since mid-October and this weekend the headphones just started not working. My sound goes in and out no matter what I do. I use them for gaming, so when I can't hear things, I have to stop my game to try to fix it.So not happy with these.Wow, so another star gone because I tried contacting Koss and found on their warranty site that I have to send them $9 of my own money for 'shipping and handling' to replace or repair. I tried sending them an email to let them know the problem and that it's not OK to charge customers for THEIR defective product... surprise surprise, it came back undeliverable.First and only time I will ever buy a Koss product.Off to get Amazon help as they understand the value of customer service even if their suppliers wouldn't know it if it hit them in the face with a 2x4."
2,Do not recommend.,"I don't recommend purchasing this item. I bought Mine around 3 months ago. They function great, but in about 3 months the mic started shorting out. Then a week later the sound was shorting, finally within two to three days, they wouldn't work at all. Now, the packaging says there is a life time warranty, no questions asked. Though, when calling for a replacement, they informed Me there would be a $9 shipping fee. After what it would cost to send Mine back with shipping and their $9 shipping, I might as well BUY another headset, another brand surely. No one wants to pay twice for a defective headset."
5,exactly what I expected,"It is exactly what I expected. Fits comfortably, blocks out all sound around me. Just what I wanted."
3,Not bad for the price,"I have been a Koss user for many years and I bought this one primarily for online gaming purposes. I also use it for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone service. The sound quality is excellent for the price and voice onversations are crystal clear. However, the Koss SB-45 Communication Stereophones headset is missing one feature that would have made for a higher rating in my opinion. There are no volume controls built into the set. Such adjustments must be made using the audio controls on the computer. This can be an annoying inconvenience during gaming. Although I am not a fan of inline volume controls because the cable wires have a tendency to break at the point of the control connector with regular usage. A built-in means of volume adjustment would have been a nice feature. Otherwise, it is a relatively good headset for the price and I would recommend it to all but the more discreminating gamers."
4,New Headphones,"These are an excellent pair of headphones. The ones I bought previous of these had broken, and I needed a new pair quickly. The sound quality is definitely worth the price that they come with.My only con is that the headphones have no way to change the volume, like an attached dial or something of the sort. Rather annoying when I'm not next to my computer. Otherwise, great pair of headphones."
4,Good buy a couple flaws,"This headset works pretty well for gaming. It is comfortable and the mic has good quality. The earpieces have decent sound quality and good isolation. The only reason these don't get 5 stars is that 1) the bass is pretty weak, especially for a closed headphone, and 2) the cord is a bit flimsy."
4,Pleasing,"It worked out of the box and my friends on TeamSpeak said my voice was very clear.The comfort is not bad, but I worry about the bottom of the earphones falling off my head. It feels like its going to slide off and air comes through the bottom of my ear area. The rest of it is sealed.I worry that I will break it if I fold it into its small form because of the ominous squeeking sounds from turning it a lot. Could be the material and friction but loud sounds are very assuring of it.Overall I like it, very good deal for what this thing can do."
2,Not as good as I'd like,"Usually Koss has pretty decent headphones, however these are not something you're going to enjoy using. They work, however the sound thru the speakers is terrible, they are hot, heavy, and sweaty. After using them about 10 minutes I feel claustrophobic, and taking them off is like coming out of a dark cave and breathing a breath of fresh clean air. The mic quality is quite decent on the other end, but that doesn't make up for the other shortcomings. If you intend to use these for anything other than short voice I'd find another pair of headphones.I should note that I'm relatively young, and still have decent hearing. I've been formally trained as an audio tech, so my expectations for audio are rather high. That said, I was overall disappointed. I wouldn't spend more than $7 for these."
2,too bulky,"I guess I did not realize how heavy and bulky this item would be. I really does muffle all sound but the weight gets to be a litte uncomforable. If you are not planning on using it for long stretches, I would recommend the purchase; if you plan on wearing the headphones for a long stretch--I would not."
2,"Great sound, but my ears get so hot","Good quality, solid build with excellent sound quality in both the microphone and ear phones. Can't use it though. They are too uncomfortable - way too tight. After 15-20 minutes my ears get unbearably hot! I am a big guy, with a fairly big head, but still, I am not Charlie Brown! I am retiring them immediately."
5,Excelent headset,"I buy this headset for a friend recommendation. This is excelent for the price, is good for game, talk, listen music and more.Pros:1)The confort.2)Audio is as a box. The sound is not lost to out.3)Large wire to connect in back panel PC.Cons:1)The Audio isn't multi speaker (5.1, 7.1) capable. When play Farcry 2 in Windows Vista with configured to 5.1 sound this lost many sounds, as shoot's, cars runnig, etc.2)The speaker wire is no flexible and is far from the mouth.In conclusion is excelent headset/speaker for this price.My friend say ""Koss is a sound specialist company"". I said this is true."
1,"Boring, not classic Scooby-doo",Fell asleeep watching this film. It jumps from one dumb story line to another. My three year old doesn't even like it
2,Brondell S400,"This seat is somewhat disapointing, The sitting area toward the back of the seat is slopped up higher so when seated you are forced to lean forward. The seat itself is not flat, it is rounded and narrow adding to discomfort. The wash wand does not come out far enough so with every wash, water is splshed on the back of the seat and needs to be wiped up. Must set power saving feature daily instead of set and forget. The unit does wash well and the water comes out warm."
2,Johnny Ramone does NOt play electric heavy metal guitar!!,"Frist of all this is an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams."
4,"Great game, however...",The game itself was great however the cartrige was a little beaten up. It apeared to have been chewed on by a cat or small dog. The game still worked and I am very satisfied. Will be using this service again.
2,"""Rising Sun: International Organized Piracy""","... is the first thing I read when I turned this game on. I bought this game expecting childhood memories to flood back, but I received a pirated copy. Not sure if it's any different functionally, it seems to run fine. However, the cart label is different than the original intended label, and the cartridge seemed pretty badly beat up. Nothing against the actual product, it's a really good puzzle-platformer. But just a word of advice, don't buy anything from ClutterDucks."
5,Botts Drums Are Great!,"All their work is excellent. Good things CD's don't wear out like the tapes and vinyls. Mike's drums set the drama and the impact of many of the songs. Next time you listen, concentrate on the drums."
3,truth saves it,"This is the true story of Our Lady of Fatima. Much was left out in the movie that can be read in books on the subject and the acting is not good, but this was expected. I recommend the book 'Our Lady of Fatima prophesies of hope or tragedy' which is a detailed account of everything concerning Fatima. An excellent book that can be obtained at [...]. or by the author William Thomas Walsh. Still, the movie is worth the buy in order to add to your Catholic collection and to remind ourselves that Mary Most Holy is active in the world scene to help and guide us."
2,Has this tea changed?,"I've noticed recently that Quietly Chamomile does not taste the same as it did in the past. It was my favorite, but not anymore.Has anyone else noticed the change??"
3,Hasn't Aged Well,"I remember loving this film when I was younger. Now, I find many of the scenes laughable. The psychiatry is over simplified and downright silly.That out of the way, Spellbound is still worth watching/owning. The Salvador Dali dream sequence is rightfully famous. The acting is good, but the chemistry between Peck and Bergman is a little odd. Ingrid Bergman, as always, is beautiful and touching. Bergman's Freud like mentor is delightful. As with any Hitchcock film, you are in the hands of a master. The music, story, and visuals mesh beautifully.Many Hitchcock films are timeless, this isn't one of them."
4,Bergman - Yes! Music from Heaven,"Not Hitchcock's best but Bergman is worth watching no matter what and the Dali dream sequences are a real breakthrough in cinema.If you like the soundtrack as much as I do, you'll want to get a recording of The Spellbound Concerto!"
4,Monterous Manual is essential if you wish to be a master DM.,"You cannot call yourself a master DM unless you become familiar with the creatures that might inhabit your realm. Like a green belt must first learn his katas before he dares to advance to black belt, a DM must learn his creatures before he can convincingly portray the monsters the PCs must battle to survive.A master DM needs to dedicate his mind to the story around the PCs and populate his realm with creatures that descend from the hills or rise from the chasms.The Monsterous Manual is THE place to start."
1,Give me a break,"This is a prime example of another gaming company making an extra buck off of the fans. At best, the Monstrous Manual and the Monstrous Compendium are equal. But how is the Manual a good tool if you can't remove your monsters for easy play. Another downside to the Manual is that you can't add monsters to it as they ""come out"". With the three ring system you had this ability. The best thing the Monstrous Manual can be used for is to make an extra buck for TSR."
2,boring and long winded,"After seeing the interview of Mr. Rankin on CBS Sunday morning I was very excited to read one of his books. I picked this one up and quite frankly wished I hadn't. To see that it is back ordered surprises me (maybe everyone else saw the interview). Mr. Rankin's mystery novel is a quick read but is one of those types of books you put down only because of boredom. It is very long winded, and not very descriptive compared to other mysteries I have read."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't get into this book. I didn't think the characters were very interesting and I really couldn't get too excited about the plot. Perhaps I found the characters too pathetic. Also, this was my first Rebus book and I must say, I don't like him much as a character. Some of the description about Edinburgh was interesting but I guess I just found the book too sordid, too boring."
3,Not too impressed,"Stop reading this if you have not read the novel, because a spoiler follows.I sure have read a lot of great comments about Ian Rankin. Comparisons to Michael Connely caused me to search him out. Not in the same league in my book. A so so story with a hard to believe plot. Does every wealthy man in Edinburgh enjoy wathcing underage junkies beat the heck out of each other and then have sex with them or watch their buddies do so? They sure are having a gay old time in Rankin's sordid Edinburgh. I liked the Rebus character, but I don't plan to seek him out again."
2,BAD remastering compromises excellent album,"The Ramones have fallen victim to terrible remastering on the latest Rhino reissues. The sound has completely changed. Listening to the original lp's that I've bought and then comparing the sound to these, demonstrates a clear decline in the power and intensity of the recordings.If your looking for cd issues of the four original lp's (all brilliant), the cd remastering on ""All the Stuff and More"" (I and II) seems minimal and therefor far superior in sound quality."
4,Evolve or Die (or something like that).,"Like every band that scores a bullseye its first time out, it isn't long before the worrysome issue of what to do for a follow-up rears its ugly head. This, of course, is where a lot of bands lose the plot and make a beeline straight for One-Hit Wonderland. Not the Ramones. Rather than simply try to repeat the two-chord assault of their debut album, on ""Leave Home"" the boys somehow manage to get poppier and (I might as well just come out and say it) more MATURE without losing any of their punky edge. Songs like ""I Remeber You"", ""What's your Game"", and the glorious ""Swallow my Pride"" are real songwriting advances that are miles ahead of anything on the first LP. Of course, there's still stuff like ""Pinhead"" and ""Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment"" for those of you who need that type of fix...."
5,Could they possibly improve over their debut?,"The punk landscape is littered with bands who were capable of blowing one load and one load only. The Sex Pistols, The New York Dolls, Richard Hell, Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers come to mind quickly and I'm sure that if I give that notion any more thought I'll be able to double that number up in no time flat.While these bands were busy dissapering from the scene, The Ramones were busy crafting their second masterpiece, one that wouldn't even crack the Billboard 100 in the U.S. but would prove to be part of rock's glorious pantheon.This CD contains what is perhaps the single best romantic song ever written about American teenagers living in the city - ""Oh Oh I Love Her So"" and a nod to The Beatles ""You're Gonna Kill That Girl"". And that's only two great songs out of 15.This particular reissue sound luscious and I'm especially thankful for the number of live cuts included. Rhino does it right again."
5,A story of redemption,"The Tryst is a story of adventure, redemption, and love. I enjoyed it very much, but I am a real Grace Livingston Hill fan and would like to read all of her books. I love the Christian message that she includes in her books and how it changes many of her characters. She has a very distinct style of the 1930's and some readers might consider it to be antiquated. She wrote in the 1930's and it was a different time period, but people haven't really changed all that much."
5,"Sweet, wholesome story","This story was well-written with several engaging characters. It will be of special interest to Christian readers, since the characters' journey to faith is a central focus of their stories. As one might expect, the story is a bit old-fashioned, but I enjoyed it even more as this suited its setting. I found it a charming story that held my interest and improved my character."
4,Inside Lindbergh's Flight,"The Spirit of St. Louis is a largely entertaining look at an important moment in history. I have two issues with the film. First of all, there are too many flashbacks that interrupt the story, although I understand their purpose of keeping the movie interesting through some of the uninteresting parts of his flight. Also, Stewart is too old for the role, but being the great actor that he is, he still pulls it off convincingly. This isn't the kind of film I would expect from director Billy Wilder, but he manages to create tension during the flight that surprised me since I knew how it would end! The film also gives the viewer a good idea of some of the technical aspects that went into creating Lindbergh's successful attempt, and the viewer also gets a good feel for what it must have been like to be inside the plane. Although not a perfect film, The Spirit of St. Louis entertains and informs, and I enjoyed it."
5,Jimmy Stewart!,"A really great film!Jimmy is terrific as Charles ""Slim"" Lindbergh!The ""lone Eagle"" flew from NYC to Paris in 1927. The first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean! Very interesting tale of his life and flight!"
1,Run for your life. Seriously.,"I thought this game was going to be like the PC version. Oh, god no. No pedestrians to run over. No way to leave tire tracks in blood. No way of knowing WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ON THE SCREEN at any given time. No way of controlling your car. No joy. No fun. No seasons in the sun. Just misery, and fifty bucks down the drain."
5,pulse racing rhythm!,"here's a lovely little story about this particular album.me & my beautiful mother were strolling downtown after we got all of business done one day,&we came across this local record shop,so we started to walk in, there it was,this gorgeous album cover staring at me.i immediately asked the clerk to please play this record & he did.just then i immediately fell in love with the fabulous pulse racing rhythm of, SPANISH FEVER!!NEEDNESS TO SAY I BOUGHT THE LAST ALBUM OF IT THAT DAY.JUST ONE WAITING FOR ME TO GRAB.EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE THIS ALBUM!!WE GOT LATIN SOUL!!J.H.52757"
3,"Good book, but too long and too confusing","I had to read this book for my 9th grade history class. I'm a really slow reader, and at 600 pages, it took me forever to read. I enjoyed the scandalous parts about Spring Moon's family, but I didn't understand the military parts. I might recommend this book for anyone that wasn't being graded on their knowledge of the storyline. It's entertaining in parts."
4,Rare Movie,This movie was crazy but funny at the same time because it was so outrageous. But I liked the chemistry between the two actors.
3,C'est Bizarre!,"If you're up for a bit of Gallic weirdness, GIRL ON THE BRIDGE should certainly fill the bill. It's beautifully shot in very evocative black and white--visually effective even if the plot is glorified TWILIGHT ZONE cum romance novel. Daniel Auteuil and Vanessa Paradis make for a lovely (platonic) couple. Lovers of moody art cinema could doubtless do worse. Still it seems to come up short in the emotional impact department. When style and substance get conflated, you sometimes end up with very interesting results. Here, though, despite the best effors of all concerned, the results are only moderately interesting."
5,Hoora for MCR,"Sometimes you get a little tired of the same crap over and over again. I was looking for something outside the emo-screamo genre and found My Chemical Romance. It was almost a breathe of fresh air to find a band with such intensity and originality like these guys. Some may find their lyrics a little too ""gothy"" for them and i was trying to steer clear of that crap myself, but this band is a major exception. Try ""Helena,"" ""The Ghost of You,"" and ""Thank You for the Venom."" It'll knock you flat on your ass."
4,MCR - I was surprised - in a good way,"My friend gave me both CDs, he said I should listen to them and I have. I like these guys a lot. They sound as if they have been through more than the average ""punk"" life. Helena is my personal favorite of all the tracks. It's sad, kinda creepy, and it has been stuck in my head for a week now. The video is pretty awesome as well, but the I'm Not Okay (I promise) video is better. Wes Andersen-esque videos on MTV make my day.All in all, I would buy this CD. It sounds more mature lyrically and instrumentally than just about any new punk band out there. Plus, it's energenic and full of cross-references and jokes.A well-rounded, mature compliment to anyone's eclectic collection."
2,no,"yes, i fell into the MCR hype. but its been almost a year since i fell into that hype, and ive left the MCR franchise forever, feeling betrayed. i was into them back when the video for Im Not Okay was just some live footage of the guys goofing around on stage and such. i loved it and got into them quickly. then they got super popular and the band said no matter how popular they got that they would never change. but they did. they changed alot. its sad to see a good band go bad. i cant even listen to this junk anymore. it sounds so fake to me. i cant believe i ever liked it. just overpriced junk in the sea of bad music that is today."
3,"Painfully maudlin, but not bad...","I have to say, I originally hated this band, because it's fans were pseudo-punks who liked crap like Simple Plan and Papa Roach. I heard a block of MCR on the radio, and they actually sounded pretty good, so I picked up this CD.It sounds a lot like post-Art of Drowning AFI, with a layer of gloss on it. The guitar work isn't memorable, but it isn't bad, either. Bass and drums are solid, and simple.The vocals are alright most of the time, but sometimes they get so freakin' sentimental, it's embarassing. That, and the album title and some of the song titles are ridiculous and too long. They remind me of Engrish. I can't wait til they come out with the new single ""All Your Base Are Belong To Us"".To sum it all up, if they shortened their titles, and stopped acting like suicide girls, they'd be a fairly solid act."
5,no emo!,"okay, I love mcr, but i must point somtin out. they are not emo! they only have 3 songs with an emo feeling[Early Sunsets Over Monroeville, Cementary Drive, and Helena(in my opinion)]."
1,this band is as punk rock as a little pink dress-stay away at all costs and hope that this pop trend will end,"rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
3,What he say?,"After hearing the song I'm Not Okay (I Promise) by this band, I was compelled to check out the CD. The song just rocked, and I was hoping for more of the same. To be honest, I was rather disappointed.I don't know if it was my stereo, or if my copy of the CD is no good, but half the time you can't hear what the singer is saying. I've looked at the lyrics, and they're great, but you just can't hear the words. I tried turning it up and it just made it worse. Perhaps there's something wrong with my CD, but it's given me a bad impression of the band itself. The music is good, but the lyrics are just impossible which takes away from it.So, if only one song on the CD has lyrics you can hear and understand, it's really not worth the buy. If you can get it to work, though, by all means, buy it."
2,It isnt all bad,"I dont think you could call this album completely bad, there are some good songs on it like Helena, Cemetery Drive, and Ghost of You, other wise the album is pretty tasteless. And sure Gerard Way is an a**hole, but hey whatever.Top Albums:. Rainbow Country-Bob Marley. Led Zeppelin-IV. August and Everything After-Counting Crows. Street Songs-Rick James. Before these Crowded Streets-Dave Matthews Band. Rock and Roll will never die-Wesley Willis. Per-Nounced-Lynyrd Skynyrd. Crash-Dave Matthews Band. Carolina Dreams-Marshall Tucker Band(Gotta pick them they're from SC). Parachutes-Coldplay. Desire-Bob Dylan"
3,Uh.... Is this really pop?!,"The computer kept saying that My Chemical Romance is pop punk, but people kept saying they are not, so now, I'm really confused. I do know ""Cementery Drive"" and ""I'm Not Okay"" is poppy. I'm not saying that this was bad, but now this band is different, they don't wear that black suit with a red tie, and both Way brothers had a hair-cut, and Gerald dyed his hair blonde. I would say that my favorite song in this album is ""I've Never Told You What I Do For Living"", ""Ghost of You"", and ""The Jetset Life Will Kill You"". But, glad that I threw this away."
2,THEY ARE NOT THE USED...,"...although they want to be like them, skip this one probably the only good song is the catchy I'm not okay but you better just download it. Buy ""The used"" or ""In love and death"" of the used, if you're not sure listen to the song samples you will love them."
5,MCR,"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge is an amazing album. It sounds more polished then I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love but it's not so over-polished that you don't recognize them.This record is honestly unlike anything else. They don't sound like anything that's in the industry.This album has given me hope for the future of music and where it's going."
2,hmm...,"Well i have to say.....this album is pure trash. Every song exept 1 have the same rythim and they all sound so similar it gets boring. Only song i can say i liked about this album is ""The Ghost Of You"" because of its deep lyrics and the melodies that give me chills.....even the singers voice sounds awsome when he screams. I think this is the only song that i can really appreciate the guys voice. And the beats rythim sounds so hunting......everytime i listen to it i always think of something so damn tragic....i just love the song. Other than that song the rest of the album is trash. And for everyone who thinks this is punk have no idea what they're talking about so be quiet. If you like good music that have a variety of sounds then dont buy this damn album...just download ""The Ghost Of You"" seriously. But if you like this kind of mtv ""punk"" music then you'll be happy with this trash."
1,not the great vinyl pressing this awesome album deserves,"i love this MCR album on my ipod but i really prefer vinyl generally. i was really excited when i saw that there was finally a vinyl release but when i put the record on i was really disappointed how hissy it sounds. listening to a great vinyl pressing always reminds me that kids growing up with mp3s (and to some extent cds) really missed out on the medium that is most likely to create a fulfilling, dynamic and memorable listening experience. the band & record company really should have spent the money on a 180 gram black vinyl pressing instead of flashy gimmicks like a stencil. maybe if we are lucky they will press it again in a few years with the normal artwork and a record that sounds as good as the content of the album. despite how much i love this album i ended up selling it used and went back to listening to the mp3s."
5,Camel Hair coat from Jos. banks,This is a classic. Makes you feel good and looks good too. Everything you would want in a classy looking coat. Very warm.
3,well...,I love Fania all stars. That's why I bought this album with my eyes (and ears) closed. It is an exelent album with wonderfull musicians BUT terrible sound. It can really ruin a good record.
2,I'm Disappointed......,"I ordered these because most reviews were favorable and they were inexpensive. I plugged them in to my Sansa C150 and they sounded average, at best. Yes they sounded better than my OEM buds but not by much. The bass was actually too deep and treble response weak (even after adjusting my equalizer settings). As for comfort, they felt good and stayed in well.I just expected better from a 4+ star rating."
3,"great sound quality, but uncomfortable","Some people have complained about the loud bass you hear from these earbuds, but I like it that way. The main down side (which I probably will trade these in for something better) is that they are uncomfortable if you're not used to wearing earbuds and they keep falling out after I've been running awhile and get sweaty."
3,"Not bad, not great; good deal for the price","The fit works well, which was my main concern. But the sound is not great. The highs are muted. It is not a crisp sound. The price is so low, you can't really lose."
2,"Decent sound quality, terrible construction","From the moment you open the box, you realize how cheap these earbuds are. Granted, they cost $10, but the foam looks like it was ripped from a stained seat cushion and barely fits in your ear. Once you manage to squeeze them in, they gradually expand and fall out within about 10 seconds.Seriously, they're inexpensive, but they're still not worth it. Go with the JBuds or another product. Koss makes great sounding products, but these earbuds are simply a poor fit for your ears."
4,Very nice headphones,"Okay, first things first: all the people who say the sound quality sucks are idiots who don't know how to use an EQ. That said, when I first plugged them in, I was appalled by the enormous amounts of bass I was getting. A quick navigation to my equalizer (which you too should have if you have a respectable mp3 player) created a decent mix of lows and highs with quality approaching that of my ""real"" Koss headphones. I love the slow memory foam on the earbuds, but I do find myself having to take them out when conversing. My main gripe is that mine are also now partially broken. I thought I would be cool and buy the kind with the mute button and the the little case, but little did I know that about two weeks later the mute button would cause the headphones to play too quiet in one ear, and too loud in the other. A piece of scotch tape fixed this, but I plan to go to Koss (I'm in Milwaukee) to get a new pair (for free!)."
4,OK for non-audiophiles,"I just got these ear plugs and have used them a few times, and I can confirm what many have said about the sound--to me it has a somewhat muffled quality. I only use them for podcasts, though, so for this price they're fine. The buds themselves seem a bit flimsy and may not last as long as others I've had, but a big plus is ready availability of replacement cushions.Koss PLUG Replacement CushionsI don't care what anyone says--they get a little funky after awhile. Fine for the price."
3,They're ok,"Not sure if I really like these. The sound is ok, but they still don't stay in my ears very well. They have a little piece inside the foam that helps it to stay attached to the base part, and if you push it too far into your ear, it pokes and hurts."
3,bought for motorcycle use,"I bought these for use under a full face motorcycle helmet for use during riding. My helmet seems to go on pretty tight, but these stayed in OK. Also, sound is good, and they cancel noise to some extent. Overall a good product."
4,Very impressive,Nice. I do lawn care and so these poor things see a LOT of torture. But they fit incredibly well and cut out an astonishing amount of background noise. I actually listen to my MP3 player at half the volume I used to because the sound-blocking is so effective. Sound great high and low.
2,"Poor durability, poorer sound","I bought these and returned them the next day. I'm quite familiar with the material used for the earplug pieces as it's the same stuff I used to use for ear plugs in my shop. If you get 3 months out of these, I'd be shocked. And it's a good thing they're black too because you'd be disgusted by how filthy this foam gets when it's bright yellow.As for the sound: I was used to my Sony ear buds which I initially refused to replace because of their evil DRM schemes. These Koss earbuds sound like I've played my Sony's through a wax paper covered pillow. Muddy, no highs, absolutely horrible. I actually spent money to sell a little piece of my soul and bought replacement Sony earbuds.I gave it two stars because they were cheap and they worked."
1,Koss should be ashamed of themselves for poor quality control,"I have been a stereo connoisseur since the 70's and have always studied and only bought the best for the money value. About 6 years ago, i bought a pair of Koss Spark Plugs and still have them. The pair that i bought 6 years ago are the most comfortable ear plugs that i have ever had and they still have exceptional base. However, i wanted another pair for my wife and when they arrived they had NO BASE whatsoever. They are extemely ""tinny"" in sound and even my wife acknowledged that they did not sound good at all. They are the exact same look and name, but apparently Koss doesn't do quality control anymore and I would suggest buying another brand, preferrably American made. These apparently are made in China, where all bad products come from."
1,Why Did You Change a Great Product?,"Like several other reviews here, I had purchased a set of these about three years ago. Those headphones sounded great with clear highs and umbelevable bass for such small drivers. My old ones were getting a little worn, so I decided to purchase these. What a disappointment! The new ones are tinny sounding with little bass. They can't handle the same amount of power that the older headphones handle with ease. The new ones come with a straight plug, the old design comes a curved plug. Beware, looks like the accountants and not the engineers have won again."
3,Koss Sparkplug,"The Koss Sparkplug is very good for use when exercising. The ear plugs stay in place during exercising. After a hard workout even perspiration did not cause them to slip. They go in the ear easily and feel comfortable. The sound is just ok. If you want rich deep sound quality you probably need to select another type of ear plug. However, for someone who wants to listen to music and not be bother with an ear plug that slips out, the Koss Sparkplug is a good choice."
3,Koss Sparkplug Earbuds,"Except for the fact the straight plug only lasts about 30 days under moderate use with an iPod touch, these ear buds work pretty well. They are quite good for use in airplanes (they don't blank the noise but reduce it substantially), and sound quality is pretty good. It is really annoying however that one channel will quit pretty quickly. I had an older version that had a right angle plug and those lasted almost a year under rough use, but these have lost a channel already. These are inexpensive so buy several so you can junk them when they quit."
5,Great earbuds for the money,I use these earbuds while exercising and they provide very good noise cancellation and excellent sound quality. I'm sure you can buy better ones but not for the same low cost. The rubber cups are easily replaceable and Koss will send you several at a very modest cost.
3,Pretty darned nice,Inexpenseive. Comfortable. Does ANYONE like the buds that come with ipods?Only with the foam was a little more secure in ear.
2,"Too Much Bass, Muddy, no Treble","I compared the Koss ""Spark Plugs"" to the Sony 829's, and there was no comparison. The Sony's sounded sooooo much better for about the same price (why buy a $300 MP3 player that sounds bad?). The heavy bass on the Koss was way too much (reminds me of an AM radio), no treble at all, I had to hyper adjust my equilizer and that still wasn't good enough to rescue the Koss earbuds.However, the Sony's didn't fit my ear (they stayed in fine when I held both hands over my ears, but made typing difficult) and the Koss fit wonderfully. What's a person to do? I returned them both and will try the Sony 51's."
2,Not a good deal,"Got these as well as one other pair. Twice now the left ear ""Plug"" has gone out in both sets. This includes the replacment set going bad as well. In my opinion it is mainly a design flaw. The wire is too thin for the thin insulator. They should make a thicker insulator and thicker coupling at the ""Plugs"" if the resistance needed to obtain performance, needs to remain constant.Also: it costs just as much to rreplace under warranty as a new pair ( you pay shipping which ironically comes the same price a s new ones ).Sorry, but if the truth hurts....Wear it......or actually, don't wear these!!!"
3,Muffled Sound Ruins Good Design,"Everyone has their preferences in phones and their dislikes.I ordered these when I ordered the KEB-24s, thinking I'd like these more. These fit better but to my ears, they are muffled. I like the others better."
2,What a waste,I used to buy these before but the last pair I just got the soundhad no base any more and it was all tinny and weak. A big disappointment.What has Koss done to what was once a great product??I will never buy these again.
1,"Godd bass, bad quality, bad fit., no customer support","The earphones has nice bass which is perfect for listening to hip hop music. The fit of the earphones is bad since it will constantly fall off during physical activity. I bought the ear plugs 1 months ago and it has stopped working because the wires of the ear plugs connecting the the mp3 player was broken, a sing of bad quality. To make things worse, customer suppport was unavailable-i called the koss customer support and received a recorded message stating that ""its offices are relocating and uable to take any calls"". What a waste of money for a bad earplug."
1,Save your money,"Unfortunately the quality of sound with these ear plugs is extremely poor.The experience is one of being in a cave or barrel with severelyaccentuated low frequency response and no mids or highs.The fit within the ear canal is terrible with severe irritation of theskin surface within the ear after short use.External noise blocking seems absent, so I doubt these ear plugs will beof any help in diminishing aircraft flight noise."
2,OK if you don't care what your music sounds like.,"I used these once and stuffed them in a drawer. If you are concerned about quality music reproduction, these are not the earphones to buy. Spend some more and get some Klipsch or Bose in ear plugs. I got Klipsch and am happy I did."
1,Big bass no fidelity,"If you like big sound, bass, an earplug and a nice earphone's purse get this set. Otherwise, these sound crude.I had been using Philips SHE5910 Virtual Surround, which broke one day. So I tried these earplugs from Koss for 2 minutes and ditched it for good. The Philip has higher fidelity, clear vocal, more high and mid range, but less bass compare these Koss. For large headphone, Sennheiser's lines are the best.I like jazz, vocal and some techno trance and these will not do. The sounds are unclear, muggy and you get ear fatigue. Maybe if you like hip hop or hard rock these might do, but they are flat out cheap and un-engineered.Koss from my experience has big sound and bass, but lack fidelity."
1,STAY AWAY!,"Stay away from these cheaply made ear phones. I thought the audio quality would save it, but you know what? If the phones cause your ears to hurt after about 2 minutes of use, audio quality is least of your worries.Things that are wrong with this product:1) black foamy things are susceptible to dust/ear wax collection.2) black foamy plugs don't fit correctly in your ear.3) the white plastic where the little speaker is housed is made cheaply so if you move while you wear this ear phone and if your ear flap touches the plastic edges - they hurt! (sharp edges of the plastic)4) The wire is made from some cheap rubbery material which means it tangles really really easily. Plus it feels sticky which is just unnatural, and you don't any wire to feel sticky.5) I implore you to consider some other headphones! Koss makes some other good onees."
4,For early Elegy fans - bought it for Hovinga,"Definitely a must for fans of early Elegy works (Labyrinth of dreams, Supremacy, Los). Eduard Hovinga shows again his sweet high pitch vocal. The melodies here are simplier than Elegy. It tends to be more Hard Rock or Power Metal but nothing ""pop"" or too much ""deja-vu"". It seems he has lost nothing of his range and its a good suprise he uses more his low vocal range.A lot of the album Lost of Elegy is in here.For the other musicians, they're pretty good but nothing special here. Great solos, the drums are simple but very good.The production should have been better. Its too much clear. A little more punch would have been great. Again, feels like the production of the first 3 Elegy."

2,Interesting effort,"It was a neat concept, awkward pacing and some jokes that didn't quite come off well pull it down. Worth a rental."
1,Unhelpful.,"I wanted to show students an informative guide to the building, and this dvd was very unhelpful; the narrative explains very little about the building. A dud. I would actually like to return it; not sure I can, but will check the policy."
3,Mixed feelings . . .,"As a regular Pilates practitioner, I found this video to be intermediate to advanced. It should be labeled as such because to those who have never practiced Pilates before, the basic 6 elements are not discussed, and throughout each movement, the basics are not emphasized which can lead to injury. This video, as so many out there, exemplifies why Pilates should be done in living color, with a Pilates instructor on hand to correct form, etc. ESPECIALLY when moving to intermediate or advanced sequences.I do like Ana Caban as an instructor to those who already have a solid Pilates background. For newbies, please go a different route."
2,annoying,"The work out itself is challenging. But, the woman's voice is sooooo annoying. Quick pace, gives a good workout, just wish I didn't have to have the sound on."
4,"A study of the world's oldest monotheistic religion, Noahism","This book explains, in a clear and reverent manner, the world's oldest monotheistic religion, the Seven Universal Laws, six given to Adam and a seventh given to Noah, and all reaffirmed to Moses at Mt. Sinai, laws for humankind for eternity. Noahism is a universal religion that is a blessing for all people but in particular for people searching for their place in spirituality. Two other good books on the subject are The Rainbow Covenant by Michael Dallen, and Palliere's book, The Unknown Sanctuary."
1,CHRISTMAS COLLECTION BY FOSTER & ALLEN,"This CD was receved 12/12/11 and the case look like someone used a saw on it.The case is in terrible condition, this is the first time I haverecieved merchandise in this condition from amazon"
2,Bean Deluxe,The Bean seems to be an excellent work out tool but ours broke the first week we had it. The included repair tool did not work so we're out $50.
3,"Great workout, but....","I really love my Bean, but after going through 4 of them in the last year, I have had enough. I use mine from 4-5 times a week and all of them sprung leaks within around 3 months of use. It does a great job working your abs, but unfortunately not well made."
5,Good Exerciser,"I had the version without the handles for many years, but when it got a leak, I was upset when I found out that the company is no longer operating. Was delighted to find The Bean through Amazon. It was even better to find one with handles, much easier to carry. I would not want to be without The Bean. It has helped me become stronger, and it gives my abs a good workout. I store it in the closet, so no big equipment to trip over."
5,A real thriller,"Having read Pandemic, I looked forward to Resistance. I wasn't disappointed. Kalla's clear writing and excellent plotting kept me turning pages like crazy wondering, ""What next?"" This is a superb medical thriller that will keep you totally engaged throughout. I recommend it to readers of both mystery and thriller genre."
5,Can't beat the price!,I sent these to my friend Tammy and she loves them!!! She had been looking all over for these with no luck.
3,Works but is made of cheap plastic,"I bought this on a trip after realizing I'd left my Nikon battery charger in my secondary camera bag. It works just fine for charging a variety of different batteries. There are three inserts for attaching Canon, Nikon, and a few other battery designs. However, the quality of the plastic is not very high. I don't expect this charger to withstand tough conditions so if you're going overseas, make sure you pack it well in your luggage."
2,Not what I expected from Canon products,"I used to work for Canon USA as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer and tested many Canon scanner and printer drivers in the past. As far as this scanner goes - I wouldn't buy another one again! The problem is in the scanner's driver, it has to recalibrate every time it scans a page. It takes 8 sec., so 8sec. times 10 pages, that's 80sec. waiting time where my other older Canon scanner does the scan right away! No wating time to warm up the lamp before each scan. What a shame !!"
1,"slow, buttons don't work as advertised","The buttons on the front of the scanner don't work as advertised, so I have to go in through the software to initiate a scan. Scans are slow but good enough quality. You're better off spending a little more money for a quality product."
3,Nice for the money,"If you're looking for real high quality scans, look elsewhere and expect to pay for it. This scanner works just fine. Especially, for the low price. I'm not sure why people have ""bitched about not getting a good scan""...Maybe they don't read the instructions that come with the scanner or don't know how to adjust the scan with the software it comes with.....Maybe they don't even calibrate their monitor correctly...Once you scan a photo, you can then import it into Photoshop or Paintshop Pro and tweak it all you want. No big deal...This is a good scanner for the money...If you want something more...then pay for it..."
2,"Poor, at best","First the good points: the scanner does actually work, and doesn't cost much.The negatives, however, are many. The driver is slow, performing a length recalibration before every scan. There isn't a WIA driver available, only TWAIN, so stuff like the Windows 'scan now' context menu item just don't work. The provided 'Scan Toolbox' software is ugly, slow, and horrible to use if you're scanning more than a few documents. The front panel buttons break easily. There is no on/off switch, so when the unreliable software hangs you have to physically disconnect it from the power and then plug it back in.All in all, not a great purchase."
5,This is the best.,I have had these a little under a month now and so far so good. I love the design because I have a lot of things that were running up my electric bill just by being plugged in. I can now easily turn off what I am not using without having to mess with unplugging everything.
3,They are just OK!,"I'm a little disappointed with the items! Some of the jars I purchased years ago cracked so I ordered this set as replacement. The quality was definitely not the same, these were thinner plastic. Also, the lids or the metal closures did not fit exactly right and did not close smoothly; it scrapes against itself as it closes. In addition the spoon on the small jar is about a quarter inch too big and extends beyond the bottom of the jar. Overall they are useable until I can find jars a little better quality."
3,"Ok film, soundtrack to die for.","I've read some rotten reviews of this film and I know it's not going to win an Oscar anytime soon, but can't see the need for such vitriol. It's what you'd expect: a film about rival gangs in a prison competing for money, drugs, respect and the studied myopia of corrupt prison officers. It's all action and you can't really get bored watching it. But what makes me want to watch it again is the soundtrack. Just a handful of hardcore punk tracks, and the last one is called ""Sometimes Anti Social but Always Anti-Fascist"" - an anti-fascist anthem at the end of a football film works for me! From a female point of view, Timothy V. Murphy's fake Russian accent is quite sexy. Not rocket science but worth a view over Saturday night's takeaway."
1,sequels do'nt always pan out,"Vender was great fast and careful, but this movie is terrible. Not even close to original as far as action and entrigue."

This kind of dross needs to be stopped and wiped out as it openly mocks sound talent and flood s the market with c**p blocking yet another door to geniune talent in the music industry.I have to give it 1 star becuase of the way Amazon software works, if I could I would give it minus 5 and torch every copy ever made!"

2,Crappy,"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. Not worth the money. Rubber ring failed and couldn't get it to fit back in. Also thin construction. For this price, I assumed it would be good. It's not."
2,From a distance they seem ok...,"...but once they're actually in your hand they look and feel like they're from the Dollar store. They rubber rings that create a seal between the lid and the can constantly fall off. The cans themselves are super thin aluminum that feels cheap. I'm just keeping cashews and almounds in them so I imagine the will work ok, but real low quality."
5,awesome,This was the item that my kitchen was missing. This Oggi 4 piece stainless steel canister set is durable. It looks great on my counters.
2,Steel Canister set,"Used for about 4 months, everything works OK, Keeps everything fresh,however, the metal canisters leave marks on the tile counter top."
2,eh... ok,they ARE NOT AIR TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!they are nice on the eyes and look good in the kitichen. i just put my goods in a ziplock bag in the canister.
5,Another hairy animal..,"Again a snarlin'heavy hard rock disc from these old road dogs. These guys wont die. Again with Billy Rankin they produced a real gem in the classic tradition of their sound.Big funky rhythms and chuggin loud guitars and the same simple tales of the road life. No heavy lyrics to analize just feel good rock by a veteran band thats been with us since 1970 and still have the swagger of a young upstart pub band. The modern Nazz era is just as good as always, McCafferty's sand paper voice Agnew's busy bass lines and this is a good Darrel Sweet performance and he is solid as ever. With a huge production this is a great album.Check out ""Boogaloo"" also for another guitar and drum bombast. Germany has been good to these old Scotts.."
2,Poor,"This book was for a class, but it's overly simple and wordy at parts where they could've said what 3 or 4 pages explained in a short paragraph, and then at other times they don't explain things that they should and the book moves forward onto the next subject. There are likely to be better books out there on behavioral research methods, it amazes me how this one made it to a 10th edition."
5,Excellent Movie,This movie is a really enjoyable movie for all ages. My son will not stop watching it.
3,A Movie Kid's Will Enjoy!,I reccomend this movie to kids only! Parents won't enjoy it. But kids love it. It's about a boy who moves from California to Scotland. He has a difficult time fitting in because he is an outsider. But he meets a vampier his age and they become friends. His family is looking for a stone that will let them become human. It turns into a gigantic adventure that all kids will love. Buy it for your kids today!
3,the Little Vampire,"I got it for my grandkids and they seem to like it enough. Not academy award stuff, but cute, family entertainment."
5,Friends can from anywhere and be anyon,"who would not like the friendship of a human boy and a boy vampire. and,because this child sees no prejudice he longs to help and does help the whole vampire family. very heartwarming."
3,it's scary,i like new movies on halloweeni Dislike vampiersmy other friend always has bookson halloween movies and loves them
2,Not Quite What It Seems,"I thought that this would be a King James Bible with the concordance integrated into it. That is not quite what the Kindle version of this product is. It is more a topical reference with scripture markings. I am sure that it would be a great tool to study with, but if you are wanting to read the Bible and then look up references, this product is not for you."
3,Bible,"The product was what the advertisement said it was. It was the kind of Bible I wanted but the cover was not what I like. It a textbook cover and not something I would like to carry to church or Bible study. But since it was as stated, I would not return it. It is in good condition and would be excellent for home study use. I havce used this study Bible for years and have enjoyed it."
1,The description is a lie.,"The description made me think I was actually going to get the Bible. All I received in the download was the concordance. If all I am being offered is a concordance, then say that! Don't make me believe that I am getting a Bible and concordance. I wasted my time looking for something that I was never going to find."
1,Not for me,I had a hard time using this app and finally removed it off my kindle. This is not user friendly.
2,Deceptive Advertisement,"I purchased this unit expecting it to play both DVDs and VCDs as advertised by Sharp. As it turns out, only one particular VCD format is supported while the other is not. So, only one type of VCDs can be viewed by this unit. Somehow Sharp has conveniently excluded this point in their product descriptions.Also, this unit gets hot after 15-20 minutes of play and while the owner's manual warns the user about exposing the unit in direct sunlight due to the heat might severely damage the unit, I can't help wonder how long it would take before this unit heads for the repair shop."
5,Nokia BH-900 Bluetooth Headset,"Excellent headset. I've been using it for a few years now, and keep buying it as there's no better replacement. Every now and then I've been trying other options but this one wins them all."
4,Fair deal to buy this piece,"This product is and effective one in terms of its usage and the different functions, with different buttons for different functions included. Has been a very handy thing. One problemm i have been facing with this device i that it witches of automatically ans some time even is very very defficult to search, i.e. it odes not connect to the phone even it hows that the device has been detected by the mobile handset. Ha some software problems with my device, but do not know about the other customers using this.Overall rating of 3.5 for this product"
3,"Nice design, but lacks staying power.","I have owned this product for over a year now. I like the look and the feel of it. It is easy enough to setup and use. I used it with a Motorola phone, and now with my TILT, and it works well enough to get the job done. It does not impress me however. The main issue I have is the lack of volume. It just won't put out enough sound to use in a car, mall, or other place with back-ground noise. I added a couple more holes for sound to come through from the speaker, but it is not enough. Now, it has lost the ability to hold a charge, so I will need to find a new battery, or a new BT device. For the money, I really expected it to kick a little more but-t. A such, I give it a middle-of-the-road rating."
2,Sorry - interesting but not romance.,"This heroine is in love is when the man is married to someone else. Interesting how the author portrays the ones involved in incest, affairs and having abortions as the good guys and gals."
1,One of the worst,"This film is absolutely one of the worst I have ever watched. It was so strange,disturbing and sick that I sped through it in a forth of the time. If you are looking for a classic or even fair vampire film this isn't it and it should not be classified as such. Please consider carefully before renting this one."
2,Best Avoided,"Quality is dire compared to the German DVD (Mosquito der Schänder), which includes the English and German audio tracks.Spec says it included a trailer which it doesn't - it's simply an overlong promo reel of some sort. Best avoided."
5,Improves options for playmats,"These links allow me to add items to the overhead struts on the Fisher-Price play mats or to lower some items so that they are more easily grabbed by my infant grandchildren. Very useful for ""customizing"" the play mats."
1,Cheap,"I usually love Kenneth Cole shoes, but these ones look and feel really cheap. I bought mine on the end of November and they lasted me a month and a half and they already broke. The sole came off by the heal and there's no way to fix them. Really disappointed."
3,Looks nice but painful,I bought the shoes from Macy's. The quality is reasonably good. They looked great but they were painful to wear. Had pain in my toes and my lower back. I'm a very tall and a little bit over weight person. That would be a factor to consider. I think it will be ok if you are a slim average height person.
3,they dug into heels,"I bought these shoes for my brother who was in dire need of a new pair of black shoes for work. We ended returning them because they dug into his heels when he wore them, but they seemed like a good shoe, just not very comfortable."
3,dig in back of your ankles,"the design is alright. you can get better pricing if you spend time shopping at the department stores. however, i agree with a previous reviewer that these shoes dig into the back of my ankles when I tried to walk in them and actually cause abrasion at the lateral malleolus (that bony protrusion on the side of the ankle). as a frequent traveler, if/when i wear these shoes, i have to wear double socks."
1,very poor quality,"This is only the second time I have worn these shoes and the sole is already breaking away from the shoe. Extremely poor quality, especially for the price. Do not buy these shoes!!!"
2,Only for the most devoted fans,"I've loved Caetano Veloso's work for years, so when I heard about A Foreign Sound, I couldn't resist buying it. My advice: resist unless you feel a need to own everything he records. It's just plain strange. Only his natural artistry saves it. I found myself skipping from one cut to the next, trying to find something I could stand to listen to all the way through. Now, I think Caetano comes across nicely in English, and I'd love to see him do another album, but next time, I hope it makes more sense.These songs odd choices -- ""Feelings"" and ""The Carioca"" are not high on my playlist these days -- and nothing seems to flow together. Better to stick with his classic recordings until he gives this another try."
2,below average,"I like Caetano a lot, I've heaps of his previous CDs, but this one sucks...a lot...He needs to put his feet back on the ground. THis Cd is sooo pretentious that it hurts...You can easely skip this one."
3,good entertainment,"Kevin Sapcey is a favorite actor. In this movie, he demonstrates his versatility in the craft. good character development is included."
2,Good Cast Done In By Mediocre Writing And Direction,"A good cast is undone by a ""seen it, been there"" script and heavy-handed direction. The script is peopled with familiar stereotypes - the Hollywood analyst who needs treatment as much as his patients because he cannot deal with his own grief following his wife's suicide; the troubled teen; the various neurotic Hollywood types. The main problem is that too many characters are introduced who remain undeveloped, so that they seem to be just filling space. Having many of them cross each other's paths has become cliched since Crash, and the ending where everyone suddenly seems to come to terms with his/her problems is just an insult to the audience. A disappointment."
4,Hot Blood Sundae is a delicious bloody treat!,"Hot Blood Sundae is very entertaining, B-horror comedy about an adult ice cream store and the stacked-and-sexy employees who work there. Some gorgeous actresses packed into very small outfits in this flick, including Bobbi Billard and Akira Lane. Also a ridiculous slasher/killer with an ice cream bucket on his head. Not bad at all if you like that sort of thing."
3,Average Slasher-Comedy,"Hot Blood Sundae has breasts. Lots and lots of breasts. Big Breasts. Small breasts. Fake breasts. Real breasts. They're all here. So why didn't I enjoy this movie more? Well, not even breasts can make up for a lackluster script and some stinky acting. Also, for a slasher movie the deaths are so lame and uninteresting. The movie kind of reminded me of a cross between Bikini Bloodbath and Jim Wynorski's Sorority House Massacre 2, only not as fun as either of those. Oh, but it has breasts. Did I mention that already?"
4,power otlet,"Very usefull ""killer"" switch at the back, can turn off almost all the devices pluged on it. Large area at top, can plug 4 chargers with 2 non switched outlets (fantastic). Large space for each plug, solid constructuion. Large space at bottom to hide the long power cord."
1,Really very poor and it's just a mixture of several books.,Poor. Mixture of several theories and stupid experiments. There are in fact other much better books.
3,REYNOLDS & DELUISE TAKE PART IN A RACE FROM CT TO CA,"BURT REYNOLDS AND DOM DELUISE ARE BOTH PARTNERS IN AN ALL STOPS OUT NO SPEED LIMIT AND HIGHLY ILLEGAL RACE FROM CONNECTICUT TO CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WITH OUT GETTING BUSTED THEY ""BORROW"" AN AMBULANCE TO USE AS THEIR RACE VEHICLE. GUEST STARS INCLUDE SAMMY DAVIS JR., ROGER MOORE, AND JIMMY ""THE GREEK"" SNYDER."
1,The Cannonball Run,"I hadn't seen this movie in years. I had forgotten just how dumb it really is. I still had a few laughs, though."
3,"It's ENTERTAINMENT! Don't take it so seriously, people.","Actually, this would get 3 1/2 stars. It's a good movie, but no award winner 5 star movie. If you're a tree-hugger (like the other reviewer) and the premise of this movie bothers you, than why did you use the electricity to watch it, not to mention using the electricity for your computer to rip it apart?"
4,"Dumb fun, and Dino and Sammy RULE!","More dumb fun from Burt and Hal Needham, just enjoy the ride.This movie probably set a record for total cast members that can't act at all, but hey, it's looks like they shot this movie over a weekend, so who cares?One big mistake, this movie could have used a lot more Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.They have the funniest lines in the movie along with the always great Jack Elam.The voice-over commentary track was fun too, a couple of old-school movie guys talking about ""makin' pictures"".They also tell some great stories about the real Cannonball Run race.Put this one in the DVD player when you just want to relax and be goofy."
5,woo hoo,It was made in the 80's. It's corny but I liked it. The ladies are hot in their tight suits. No nudity.
2,The Cannonball Run,I purchased this video because Amazon had the offer of purchasing 3 DVD or videos and receiving a 4th one free. I puchased three videos and 2 books but did not receive a 4th one free so I would caution all who see the same offer as I not to rely on the validity of the offer....Rosella Mehling
1,Do not buy this,"The movie is good, however we cannot watch it because we hate the widescreen format. Nowhere in the description and product details does it say that it is widescreen. We looked.What is it with the companies putting out only widescreen. Give us fullscreen! At least have both so that customers can choose.The movie is good but the format sucks. Because of the widescreen, we give it 1 star. We recommend that you do not purchase this item until it is available in the fullscreen format."
3,Eccentricity,"It wasn't what I expected. I was watching a Herbie Hancock special in which Wayne, amongst other stars, was featured. I understand the acclaim, but not this LP- it just wasn't my cup of tea."
3,My world?.. well yes this is,"Secret Affair... if you like the post punk retro 60's sound which the band described as `new wave soul' then you can do no better than this album.I personally didn't take it out of my car CD player for weeks, I can describe their band sound as not as hard as The Jam but not as soft as the Style Council.Now if you don't know who those bands are then this album is not for you!"
2,"A different direction for GU, typical for Freeland","I am going to have to give this one a few more spins in my rotation. I'm not a huge electro-funk style fan and therefore don't fully get this album. Of course this goes right in line with the typical ""Miami"" expectation of: ""If it's not progressive, it's not music."" I will admit, this release seems somewhat listenable at times. Disc 2 starts a little more progressive but never really seems to take off. Disc one is a trippy ride to electro land that I just don't appreciate.Perhaps my viewpoint will change with time...but for now....ehhh.For those that enjoy this...check out Tiga, or most of the FabricLive series."
1,1989,"awful, awful, awful. is it 1989 again? so dissapointing. I just can't convey how awful this is. if you want a great Global Underground disc, try Deep Dish, John Digweed or James Lavelle' installments. Deep Dish's solo projects by Sharam and Dubfire are also pure gold.Avoid GU 32 like the plague."
3,Evening by the fire,Nice collection of classics for the guitar that was easy to listen to. No surprises and no disappointments.
4,good cd,"I am writing this review because I saw that someone gave a 2 stars to this cd. The only problem with this cd is that it only has four songs and only two are bloody good. even if it only had Juanito Alimaña, the cd is worth it because Juanito Alimaña is a clasic song that you just can't find in other cds."
1,Outrageous,"Do NOT order this book on Amazon. It's just an extremely bad scan. Three pages of the text are missing (43, 65, 117), and all the photo plates (seven of them) are simply black blots without any recognizable form.This is a true affront to the Oxford University Press that originally published this book and whose mark is on the very first page. A SWINDLE!"
1,OVERPRICED!,The list price on Alba's website is $5.99 but on Amazon the list price is listed at $11.10.
5,A purer Love,"Films about imagination and about involving a weirdo make me feel at home. This film brings me home every time I watch it. Depp and Ryder are two people who can really bring out the best of imagination and a delightful weirdness. Depp's character, a strange creation with scissor-like hands(if you can imagine)speaks to me in how different he is. When he comes to a suburban town, people love him, but for the wrong reasons. One girl, Ryder, sees him for him and loves him for that. Their relationship gives me hope everytime I watch this film. I am reminded how sweet and rescuing a purer love is. This film is on my five star list."
3,hope it makes the cut,i bought as part of christmas gift so i havent opened it yet. i hope i am not disappointed at the end
4,Go Jonny Depp!,"This movie is a great movie! I think most parts are appropite for all ages. There's some parts that may not be, so I suggest if you have a young child to watch it with them. Or you could watch it first and see if you think it's ok for them to see. There is some blood and violence but besides that its a very good movie. When I first saw it it was one of my favorite movies. In the opening there's an old lady telling a story to her (was it grand daughter?) - and the story was acully about her and Edward Scissor Hands. The makeup he wears looks so odd and also the hands already look odd. And the reason why he's alone and has no real hands is because his creator died right before he could finish him. This movie is very sad but it's a great movie.Nori"
3,Not too good extras,"**This is for the collectable tin version**The DVD content is basically the same from other Edward Scissorhand DVD versions, but this version is dynamite for DVD collectors. This DVD has limited edition tin, 8 Collectable movie stills, and the same features from other versions. If you would like to know:*Audio Commentary by Tim Burton and Danny Elfman*Original release Featurette*Concept Art*Theatrical Trailer and TV Spots"
4,Exciting Movie For All Ages,Great movie. You gotto watch it if you haven't yet. Really good roling by Johnny Depp. It will tie you to your screen. Some pats has great affects on people because of the surrealist scenes. If you are looking for a movie both emotional and unreal this would do for you.
3,A Story Of a Extra Ordinary Man,"The film is about a machine like a human and a family. A woman tries to sell some cosmetics and finds the Edward, the machine. The woman takes him to her house and Edward begins to live with her family. Then the film begins to show us the change in their lives. The film is a kind of tragicomedy, because you can laugh in some scenes and feel sad in the other ones. In every part of the film you focus on Edward, because he seems strange. The director tries to affect the audience by some extra ordinary scenes. I think director is successful, because while you are watching film you wonder what will happen next. And it makes you to think about the film."
2,2 of 5,"Edward has scissors for hands, but no one ever says why. All his backstory explains is that the scissors; which, like his mountain home and the personalities of the people in the surrounding neighborhood he eventually pierces, are largely exaggerated; were supposed to be temporary. But the man who invented him died just before putting on his hands.Not that it matters much. Scissorhands, a well-mannered ghost of a man dressed in all leather like a slave in a bondage session, is annoying rather than intriguing, and I don't care anything about him. So even when a plot finally begins to develop, it's all in vain. The fairy tale epilogue, which explains the origin of snow in pastel Suburbia, is cute though.marcellee.com"
2,Could've been much more...,"So the movie itself is still great. Visually, creatively, everything. However, I can't recommend this movie on DVD. The extra's don't do anything to enhance the movie. It has a few Q&A type questions, from the cast and crew, that last about 20-40 seconds each. Burton is a great filmmaker, but he definitely cut the audience short on the inspiration for this movie, and what went into making it. It's just not one that I could recommend. Save your bucks for something else."
5,Simply one of the Best,This is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again with out getting sick of it. It's that good!
3,"Great Art, Weaker Story","Since it's Frank Miller, you know this graphic novel looks awesome, and you can pretty much count on a dark moodiness too. The book starts with samurai in feudal Japan failing his master and becoming ronin (wandering and masterless) before a climactic encounter with the demon who slew his master. Then the book flashes forward to a dystopian 21st-century New York where the streets are rubble ruled by gangs, and ghouls rule beneath the streets. The ronin and demon's story is carried on in the context of a a giant corporation involved in bio-technology. It gets a little complicated and somewhat cheezy after that, but it's still worth checking out."
3,"Great art, so-so story","The # of 5-star reviews for Ronin demonstrates a problem with the comic-book field i.e. there's such a dearth of great writing that good, competent writing is over-hailed.Frank Miller is a terrific artist, and he plots well, and writes good crime fiction. But c'mon, Ronin's story isn't really that great...doesn't deserve all of the hype. IMHO, only a few graphic novels like Sandman or Watchmen are actually worthy of all of their accolades."
4,"Miller being creative, and when he could draw well","I had an old friend who owned this book when we were younger. Having recently read this for the first time, I wish I had picked it up sooner. Very cool storyline (especially if you consider when it was penned), drawings are well done when they need to be, and simple when it will suffice (unlike most modern comic artists who need to show off in every damn panel).My only gripe is that this it obviously a later printing, and the cover is newly drawn by Miller. If you're like me and really just can't stand to look at his most recent 'style' (if you choose to call it that), you'll wince when you look at the cover and wonder why they had to change it at all."
3,Book for school,The over all time to get the book was good and the condition was good. Just like in the the message said when I went to buy it.
1,"cheap, cheap, cheap",Terrible. Burned out after first use. The company itself was horrible about it.Avoid at all costs.
4,Read the Bible 1st!!! Then read this book with discernment,"When reading any book that teaches faith, prosperity, and spiritual gifts, always use discernment and read the Bible daily, as my Pastor Art Aragon always says, we need to get in the word daily, and not only get onto the word but live the word!!! This book is motivational more then religious, however there are many scriptures in the book, just remember you should also look up the scriptures in the Bible for yourself and make sure that they are NOT taken out of context. I was raised in the Calvary Chapels, and later in life decided I wanted a more charasmatic experience in my life, and belive me the Holy Spirit is stil lworking miricles everyday. I too ka lot of good things away from this book, especially positive thinking from the word of God."
4,Great Accessory for Onkyo Receivers,"This is a great accessory for an Onkyo receiver. Very easy to connect and configure. Wonderful sound and look's nice. Perfect for listening music, however a little more complicated to view video. Receiver's (TX-SR605) remote control works ok with this dock using the supplied RI cable. The bad: The OSD is awful and old style. Forget it."
3,GOOD FOR THE MONEY,IT IS VERY GOOD DEVICE WORKS VERY WELL WITH MY SR605 THE SOUND IS VERY CLEAR AND IT IS WORTH THE MONEY NOT MUCH NOISE INTERFERENCE WORKSWORKS WELL WITH MY IPHONE
3,Dock is nice but the the OSD Stinks,"If you can get another ipod interactive dock for your receiver, I would suggest it if it is cheaper. The OSD is archaic and is no fun to muddle through."
4,Works exactly as advertised,"I bought this ipod doc to use with my Onkyo 8511 receiver. The design of the docking station is attractive, works well and easily accomidates different ipods. Setup was easy. Sound quality is excellent. The on screen display, although not hi-resolution graphics, is perfectly serviceable and a nice addition to the usual ipod dock, allowing the user to select songs easily from anywhere in a large room. The Onkyo DS-A2X works exactly as advertised."
5,sweet!,this unit is a joy to link up with the onkyo receiver- works wonderful and very simplistic!love it!
4,Not Bad/ Not Great,"I bought this product to supplement my Onkyo 605 (great receiver) and was expecting the same great engineering from Onkyo.The audio is great, but it is very old tech. when it comes to the screen display. Looks like the old 80's video games.It is also painful to switch between displays. Aside from all of this, it charges my Ipod and lets me listen to music while I work out.Little overpriced for what you get."
2,Preistess of where?,"If you're a great fan of Mist's of Avalon the first book, I wouldn't waste my money on this one. I was exited about a new book by Ms. Zimmer. To my surprise thisBook was a complete disappointment! I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. If you would like to still read it, I suggest going to the library!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Fails to capture any of what makes the first book more special. There is no Arthur, no Merlin, no Morgan, none of those characters at all really, but more of other priestesses that on reading, that I had no interest in. I guess it boils down to the less Arthuriana, the lower the rating, for this series."
4,DONT BE MISLED....,"is this their best album?not by any means,but i dont understand why people blast this release.this disc has probably their best production,which helps bring out the riffs - i also feel that the slow,sludgy pace is almost hypnotic.""doom"" indeed!no,the vocalist is not on the same caliber as Wino or Reagers,but he doesnt suck either.so,if you are a fan already,this is worth adding to your collection.if you are a newbie,it is a fine introduction to where St. Vitus was at (provided you can find a copy!)"
5,Nanotechnology: A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea,Good book for begginers. It starts simple and build you up. Not too many hard conecpts.
4,A boot and a shoe -but not wrong-footed,"There are some prickly reviewers out there. Some people obviously didn't like this -which is fine, but they sound like they didn't like it for all the wrong reasons. Sam is no longer Leslie and Leslie no longer Sam and vice-versa (although they are the same). This is an interesting album, and Sam Phillips writes twisty and intruiging lines. The musicianship is impeccable and there's a late-night kind of feel to it. While it doesn't possess the lighter moments that highlight ""Fan Dance"", it's probably reflective of her own troubles at the time of writing. The song 'Help is coming' (one day late) is my favourite track. It sounds like a sad song and probably comes from pain but seems to be suggest that answers do come but not according to our demands, or notions of punctuality. I guess it's a believing persons version of clouds with silver linings."
1,'La Ronde' for Dummies:,"Man: Hello. Come in to my small Parisian apartment overlooking the river.Woman: I can't stay but a minute.Man: Come closer...take off your corset.Woman: You're pretty fresh, you are.Man: A kiss!Woman: Somebody might see!Man: We can go somewhere private.Woman: It's too far...my sister...Man: Cognac?Woman: I'm not thirsty.Man: Stupid thing! My treasure!Woman: You're tearing my chemise...oooh...Man: I love you! Let's screw!Woman: No! Oh, okay.Later -Man: (weeping)Woman: What's your name again?"
2,"Disappointed? Yes, a little.","I bought this as a fan of ""Wallace and Gromit"" and a fan of animation. The animation is fine, but if you are expecting a story with the kind of humor and action you get in ""The Wrong Trousers"" or ""A Close Shave"" you too will be disappointed. If you want a harmless holiday DVD to distract the kids for a while, you'll be happy. For me, I can't honestly see pulling this out every year (unless the kids ask for it). For my money, I'd rather watch ""A Christmas Story"" or any of the the old Rudolph/Santa movies from my childhood."
2,Not formatted very well...,This Kindle edition doesn't do the poem any justice at all.Hardcore fans are more likely to have paper copies anyway.This isn't an illustrated version either.The text is grouped together oddly with the appearance of an - sign at the end of every other sentence.It isn't a very good reflection of the flow or text. Although perhaps ok enough to get the general gist of things it certainly isn't a brilliant copy.AVP-UK
2,"Great buildup, great letdown.","Iggie's House begins as a pleasant read with an easily-accessible character and believably enjoyable high-jinks as Winnie grapples with the racism she didn't realize existed in her town, in her parents, and in herself. A moral could be smoothly inserted without even seeming terribly pedantic. However, the final few chapters, suffer a tremendous breakdown.Blume chooses to treat the reader as an untrusting parent would treat an irresponsible child by not explaining any meaningful rationale behind the various parties' decisions regarding moving away. Moreover, the physical telling of the conclusion involves surprisingly messy narration and unfocused dialogue. The nice setup is unfortunately wasted."
2,Describes ways of life,This was an excellent book to read. It was good to see the changes in character's when they knew who the where
3,Blume the dyed-in-the-wool liberal,"While I found the book entertaining, Blume comes across as preachy.Everyone has the right to like/not like someone for ANY reason, race included. HOWEVER--it doesn't give anyone the right to harass anyone else.If someone prefers to be around others of their own race, that is their right.She mentions the Detroit race riots in the book. My dad was living in Detroit at the time and saw it first-hand--he could not go home from work for three days, it was that bad."
1,Copy Protected,"This is no notice that this CD is copy pretected, that means it is useless to me as i make my own CDs and have an ipod. I do not pirate.I love the CD but I will now have to buy again onitunes."
2,...DEFINITELY A BIT WEAK,"My real rating is ""2 & a Half Stars"" for ""Play It To The Bone"" ....It is definitely weak in many areas, but it still managed to make me laugh more than a few times. Just go into it expecting a comedy instead of a serious boxing movie. The fight at the end was pretty realistic-looking and cool, even though the ending was very predictable. ...."
4,Pretty good despite bad reviews,"I don't know whether it is my own lack of intelligence, or this movie simply appeals to me for some reason - I don't even know why, but I really liked it. For some strange reason the movie felt refreshing, at times exciting and overall pleasant despite broken eyes, jaws and bloody everything at the end.I thought the characters were plausible, actions and emotions were credible for the most part, music was good. It seemed like a medium-to small- budget movie, definitely off beat, but heck, it takes all kinds, doesn't it?The only character I did not at all dig was Lucy Liu's. She simply was too trashy for my taste. Besides, I think she is too ugly to play an arm candy... But that's just my humble opinion."
4,Eu gostei,"Nao entendo os que nao gostaram deste filme. P'ra mim, Woody Harrilson e um bom ator, e Ron Shelton direitou bem"
5,A Real Book,"This book is outstanding. It takes characters that are next door and introduces you to their fears, challenges, hopes, dreams, and failures all in the same story. ""Moonbeams"" is one of the best stories I've read and ""Not exactly a parable"" is one of the saddest creepiest stories. The author pulls you in and makes you feel tons of different emotions about the same characters. You are inside their heads and can feel as if you are right there with them. A definite must read!!!!!!The author also gives you just enough to allow you to interpret the story yourself. I felt while reading that I was part of the art.OUTSTANDING STUFF!"
3,Short and Sweet,"Just got back from the North Shore and was missing it. Saw the video and bought it. Its fast paced with no narration, just tunes. It was short only 30 minutes with only quick views of Halewia and none of the bay! . Its just basic nice waves and surfing. I was disappointed because a video is needed catching the whole vibe of the North shore Area. The story and feel beyond the great surfing. The Real shaved ice, the shrimp trucks, the ranch, the small great restaurants and the local ""underground"" flavor. Even hit on the locals vs. high rise development angle. Its a treasure, and by the way don't go."
2,Flawed by misunderstanding,"While thought provoking, Fingarette often misses the nuances of meaning in the text of the _Analects_, which limits the accuracy of his understanding. Further, Fingarette underestimates the difficulties inherent in dealing with a text which clearly is the work of many hands over a longer period of time, not a treatise in the western sense. This book is worth reading, but must be approached with great skepticism."
2,Truimph of the Will,"Overall, the picture was somewhat of a disappointment. While much of the footage is interesting from a historical point of view,the photography has not been digitally remastered. As for content, a more descriptive title my be ""Hitler Goes to a Parade."" It becomes repetitive for the length of the film. The narration, does nothing to enhance the film. ""Hitler put himself on a pedestal."" We know that. What we want to know is how does a tryant like Hitler take control of a couple of million people and bring them and himself to total destruction."
3,A true horror movie (and a blueprint for Obama's propaganda machine),"""Triumph of the Will"" is simply terrifying for many reasons, not the least of which is its applicability to modern America. This film is basically a training manual for the Obama administration's propaganda machine. If you doubt that claim, take this test: In Hitler's speech, replace the word ""Jews"" with ""Tea Party,"" and suddenly Hitler sounds like a Democratic Party spokesman and/or MSNBC commentator. I can't think of a horror movie that's more frightening."
4,Still terrifying after 60 years!,"Connoisseur Video Collection has put out yet another brilliant film, this time on DVD. There is not much that can be said of Hitler that hasn't been said or speculated over the last century. The production of this DVD is quite superb with a state of the art Menu Page and Scene Selection page, but what i find intriguing about this DVD is that the integrity of the film was kept in tact...still hauntingly dark with it's natural light source which was used throught the film (there were few shots that actually used electric lighting). Accompaning this DVD is a beautiful package which includes a 6 page booklet with wonderful photos and a text focusing on Leni Riefenstal, the director, detailing her ups and downs before and after the war both personally and professionally. A very insightful source of info on Leni Riefenstahl, who's life is more spectacular than Hitler's I came to find out after reading this booklet. Great learning! thanks Connoisseur!"
4,Quality is a bit disappointing...,"I've owned a VHS copy of this film for 20 years or so and was eager to replace it with a DVD. I'd hoped for better quality than this. On the other hand, the optional running commentary by historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro is worth the price of admission. If you want to understand the evil that was Adolf Hitler and Naziism, you gotta go to the original source material and this is the Real Deal. This is how Hitler and his people wanted the world to see them and, given the perspective of history, it's far more revealing than they could have known at the time.No wonder than Frank Capra borrowed heavily from Triumph of the Will when he wanted to show the sinister aspect of the Nazis in his ""Why We Fight"" series of films for the U.S. armed forces.If you're serious about history or film (or the history of film), this DVD belongs in your collection."
1,Amazon- STOP THIS STUPIDITY,"Amazon is now combining reviews from all editions that has the same title, and because of that there are negative reviews here that belong to another inferior edition, and because reviews from this edition appear on the page of the other inferior edition, people bought it and were disappointed. End this crap now and leave reviews the way they were in the past"
5,Loving Portrait of a Madman,"Forget ""Scream"" and ""Friday the 13th."" If you want to see something that will scare you to death, watch this film. See a worshipping portrayal of the man whose maniacal twisted vision of a Third Reich that led to a war that left tens of millions of people dead. This is not to suggest this is a simplistic film. This is a brilliant film. You will be amazed by it. Propaganda film at its best."
2,Ad Moore-inem,"Yes, this meta-documentary shows, in a rather cobbled way, some interesting sides of how Michael Moore's fudging and bending distort some truths. But, too often, books and films like this one seem to exist to say, ""Well, Mikey Moore and his ilk aren't 100% titanium pure, therefore the issues they care about are non-issues and the films and books they produce are untruthful, inferior, lying crap and not fit for real 'merkins."" That's called distortion,too, in my view."
3,Manipulator vs. Manipulator,"Debbie Melnyk's film, unlike other films about Moore that tend to be wing nut hatchet jobs, questions his approach to making films rather than his politics, accusing him of exploiting issues for personal gain. We live in a world where info-tainment & spin has become business as usual. Right wing shouting heads, Carl Rove, Ralph Nader, Michael Moore & now Debbie Melnyk all competing for a piece of the action. She does indeed turn the tables on Moore unfortunately she also commits many of the same sins she accuses him of. Following him around and pestering him for interviews at inopportune moments, presenting his detractors, some obviously jealous film makers, as if they were unbiased voice of authority, cherry picking and bending facts to build her case"
2,disappointed,"I have read many of Allende's books and enjoyed them. Unfortunately, this one was a dud. The characters were wooden stereotypes and the story was far-fetched. I kept reading, thinking things would begin to gel, but they never did. Eliza was too unbelievable a character, as were most of the others. Too bad."
2,Allende's First Disappointment,"Usually a big fan of Allende, I have been known to rave about her books for months after reading them because of the compelling stories and the lovely prose. This time something did not click. It is neither charming/captivating nor interesting. I may not be able to finish this one. It is a pity Oprah did not catch on to Allende when Paula was published."
2,More of the same,"Taking a page from her roots as a translator for Barbara Cartland novels from English to Spanish, Allende spins another romantic novel in the same mold as her previous works. A decent work, but certainly not 'brilliant' or 'genius' as many editorials have proclaimed. Provocative and sensual, yes. Angela Carter, no. She perhaps has some genius in cashing in on a distant relative, Salvador Allende, by keeping the name through marriages. If you have never read a book by her, please read this, you won't need to pick up another as they vary quite little in depth and scope."
1,"Awful, verbose, dialog-deprived drivel","and House of the Spirits is one of my favorite books. I don't even believe she wrote this boring, loquacious crap. Made it through about 200 pages...."
5,Simply great.,Though it took me a while to finish this-I was busy for the most-I read Daughter of Fortune with pleasure. Isabelle's work is nicely done and Margaret Sayers Payden-who should have credit-did a really great job of translating. A worthy Oprah read.
5,a rich tapestry,Author writes with a smooth flowas she weaves her characters into a rich taprstry. Eliza is raised in Chile and follows her teen age lover to California during the goldrush.`Racial bias at its worst shows how women and men lived during the early days of San Francisco. Women were property rgardless of their race;class in one form or another existed for men as well. Eliza finds herself in love with a Chinese physician who practices acupuncture and uses herbal medicine ever looking for new ways to improve his skills. A way of life painted in great detail kept me reading as I thought of my great-grandparents and how they lived in that time period. I feel sorry for the readers who did not like this book..I loved it and highly reccommend it..to me it was fascinating!
4,worth reading,"While I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Allende's writing style and scope of research she obviously did to write this book, I felt that after she superbly spent the first half of the book setting the stage, the second half sort of went nowhere. Like she was weaving a tapestry and it started unraveling before she was done. Her writing style captivated me and that is what kept me interested in reading the book until the very last page. Definitely worth reading."
4,It fell apart at the end,"I listened to this on audio and was mesmerized for the most part. I loved the charachters and how the plot wove between Chile, China and California. However when I got to the last disc I thought how on earth is this all going to tie together. It seems that Ms Allende is setting us up for a sequel.That's the only explanation that I can see because it leaves the reader hanging to some degree. Daughter of Fortune is better than Zorro and I think it is because there is more character development of the women. I also found it interesting how Ms Allende described the many types of love that one encounters in one's lifetime."
3,Not a Great Piece of Literature,"But an entertaining read.What I mean is that I read this book for my book discussion group. Unlike other books we've read, I am not sure that there's much to discuss. I don't see a lot of ""turning points"" in this book, where a character is forced to make a decision, and makes one that the reader doesn't expect.This is not to say that it's predictible, of course. There's a wide range of locales, spanning three continents. It would probably be enjoyed by people who enjoy novels about a ""woman making her own way in the world.""For a (completely different) historical novel focusing on a woman, I recommend _The Russländer_ by Sandra Birdsell."
4,i loved it,"Very well done by Ms. Isabel Allende. I like the book from start to finish. The secrets that each of the character holds kept me wanting to read more and more. Then soon enough, i could not put it down anymore. The love triangle between Tao Chi'en, Eliza, and Joaquin kep me connected to the book. I gave this book 4 stars because it kept me connected and interested. After reading this book, I also got into reading book that are made by Ms. Allende.I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to read about the adventures of finding true love."
3,too ambitious,"I loved House of the Spirits, but this book went all over the map in its effort to paint a picture of Eliza's childhood, etc., in an effort to show why she would go chase a man to California who clearly had problems, didn't love her and never found out she was trying to find him. I was disappointed."
4,Good reading...,"I enjoyed reading the book. I thought the characters were interesting and well developed. The plot was sort of fantastic, but if I wanted reality, I'd read non-fiction. I liked the way it all came together at the end. Not exactly ""happily ever after"", but congruent. I rather liked the writer's blending of cultures and characters in the ""new"" land. It was a colorful story and an enjoyable read. I would recommend it to others."
1,Totally Over-rated!,"Daughter of Fortune was very disappointing! It had NO point! A woman poses as a man while her former lover turns into a murdering, pillaging legend. I've read almost all of the books from Oprah's Book Club, and this one really should not have been on there!"
2,"Daughter of Fortune, By Isabel Allende","Questions unanswered. What happen to Mama Fresia. When will Eliza find out Miss Rose is on her way to California? There is another whole story, which should include reactions when they find out it's Miss Rose writting the Pornagraph Books."
3,"Mediocre, predictable.","Normally, I like Allende, although her works are always better in her native Spanish. But this novel was surprisingly lackluster in its plot and character development.This was a very easy read, but didn't really get me going. The plot is very predictable, It seems like this story has been written over and over again with nothing to distinguish them from any other romantic story. If you can read it, do so-- it's a fun read, but not worth the [money]to buy."
3,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this book. While it was a good story, I found myself thinking more about the history and place and lost interest in Eliza. I thought the book really ran out of steam once she leaves Sacramento - we don't see or feel much about her emotions during the time when she is coming to realize that she is on a journey in search of herself rather than for Joaquin. I wish I had read the book in Spanish because I think this may be a relatively pedestrian transalation.When I finished the book, my first impulse was to go back and read Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose - a superior but similar novel. I believe that Daughter of Fortune will ultimately be considered a minor work by an otherwise accomplished writer."
2,A Grand Disappointment From Isabel Allende,"Regrettably ""Daughter of Fortune"" is a far cry from Allende's great novels such as ""House of the Spirits"" and ""Eva Luna"". There is far less magical realism, and instead, regrettably, ample banal realism present in this novel. Indeed, one could regard it as a ""paint-by-numbers"" tale in which the plot and characters seem too familiar and contrived. The most appealing character in the novel is the Chinese doctor Tao Chi'en. I wish Allende had built her tale around him, emphasizing his own epic journey from Manchu-occupied China to Chile and finally, California, instead of her main protagonist Eliza Sommers. Unfortunately Sommers comes across as the least interesting female character in a novel replete with strong-willed wives and prostitutes. Those in search of epic writing by Isabel Allende should turn instead to her earlier work, most notably ""House of Spirits"" and ""Eva Luna""."
2,Formula Romance + Adventure,"Girl gets boy, girl looses boy, girl finds another boy. Sorry but I did not find this to be an epic novel. The characters seemed very formula driven to me. However, the adventure and historical pieces I did find of interest -- 19th century Chilean society and economics, sailing from Chile to California, the California Gold Rush, the early Chinese immigrants, the birth and development of San Francisio and the state of California."
3,Not her best work,"I loved some of Allende's previous novels. This is not her best work, but it's still an enjoyable story. Some of the motives and actions of the main character, Eliza, seem a bit contrived at times - convenient to move the story along. Her relationship with Tao could definitley be better developed and explored. I was also disappointed in the tone the book takes when describing San Francisco during the Gold Rush. Allende wants to force her viewpoint on us instead of weaving it cleverly into the narrative. There was a good story here, but Allende could have done a better job telling it."
2,"Strange book, not sure it was worth the effort","This was a difficult read. I've never read Allende before so I assumed that maybe the problem was in a translation or something. And then I read the other customer reviews which says that this is simply not her best book. On that, I can't comment. But this was not my favorite either. I was tempted to abandon the book at several points. It got mildly intriguing when the ""California gold rush"" got underway, and I found this book to take so many bizarre turns, I stuck with it. I think Allende was trying to make too many statements about disjointed social issues and ultimately, her point got lost entirely. There's social class issues, gender issues, race issues, moral issues (the prostitutes were memorable), ethnic issues and on and on. What was her point? ...Don't know if I can recommend this one."
3,It gets better as you read...,"It really took me a long time to get into this book. Allende spends so much time describing the rich Chilean culture and environment that the book inches along for 150 or so pages before the plot really gets good. Unfortunately, by this time, the main character was not developed well enough for the reader to understand her passion and motivation or even care that much. Tao Chi'en was much more developed, easy to understand and relate to; that I would have preferred more focus on his young life and his love for Lin, what drove him to leave his country forever. The characters later in the book are colorful and sympathetic...all joining the gold-rush for different reasons. The book ends well, but it sure was a slow start!"
2,ok,This was very nice in the pic which is why I picked this.. I sent out two actually...well the gift is much smaller then it shows and the gift wrap had a blue wrinkled bag with the brown amazon box inside..it showed on the gift wrap option that they were wrapped individually which was absolutely not the case..it was stupid to pay to have them wrapped...I am very disappointed in this and wish I didn't send it let alone 2 of them..
1,Anyone want to give a stale food basket?,"I purchased this for my sister for Christmas, because she loves receiving food and gourmet baskets. This was my first order from this company. My sister said it was mostly filled with ""fluff,"" and most of the products were stale. I would like to get a refund on this gift or send her a new one. She said she didn't want to hurt my feelings, but she thought I would want to know. Nice basket, sis but almost everything was stale. Could this be last year's left overs? I would not reccommend this product. I give it an F for fraud advertising!"
2,"Compared to previous releases, nothing special here","First off. Common?? Neptunes?? Neptunes as in the same production team that did Hot in Herre and Im a slave 4 you? Seems like Common sense that he is trying to broaden his audience. And the cover of the album?? What the hell is that? What is he trying to do, get a Ben Kravenston look?"
2,"Eclectic, yes - Electric, yes - Enjoyable, not quite","Don't be fooled by this record. I am not sure if Common and ?uest were trying to be cutting edge, but if so, this album doesn't quite do it. It's like listening to an album trying way too hard to be progressive, but ending up sounding like a bunch of stuff crammed together for no real purpose.There are some standout tracks - ""I Am Music,"" ""The Hustle,"" and ""I Got A Right Ta"" (a track I like more now than I did when I heard it out of the context of this record). But overall, it's not innovative, it's just different - for Common. Remember Stankonia? Electric Circus is a scaled down version without all that pesky cutting edge stuff that Stankonia embodied.I applaud Common for taking this journey, but I hope next time I get less of everyone else, and more of him."
5,Chocolate Star,"Common's new CD is ahead of it's time. Each song is a all out assault on your senses. With guest appearances by Erykah Badu, Omar, Bilal, Jill Scott and Prince. This album sets sail on a musical journey through Hip Hop, Trip Hop,Soul,Jazz and Rock.Common is not just another MC. He is a FULL BLOWN ARTIST.Dont Sleep.................Markinyo"
3,Electric Cir,"Let me get started by saying the single was wonderful but the album was ahhahh ok. Not the best and not the worst. I understand the he was trying to expand what he was writing about, but he didn't have to change his entire sound. Also some songs are wonderful and I commend Common on his creatvity."
2,I'm a HUGE Common fan! But...,"This is a strange CD. I picked it up, just to say I have his complete collection. There's 3 tracks you can groove to, otherwise the rest seem 'irratic' at times. There was different production on this one, that may be why."
3,"Great organizer, despite rust problem","All the reviews are correct, there is a rust problem. Our Oxo Good Grips Stainless Steel Sink Organizer is about 2 years old and the brush holder broke off the base today. However, that did not stop me from ordering another one. We're hoping the quality of the ""Stainless Steel"" has improved over the years."
3,Doesn't fit the Oxo brushes very well,Great idea. But my Oxo brushes (the ones that hold soap in the handles) just don't fit well - the fall over & out or drip to the side. Wish they worked together better.
2,sink organizer,"looks nice; but is not functional. You have to hold the base to take out brushes (or insert them), also it could be a bit bigger, you have to squeeze everything in."
2,Meh,"It is nice looking, and it does its job, but it started rusting pretty fast.I would not buy another."
3,"good, could be better","Great idea for organizing items in a compact space, but should have gone a bit further. Organizer is not quite wide enuf to allow the standing cleaning devices to drip into tray. The pads are are sized appropriately for cleaning, but hang over the drip tray and drip onto the counter. Must try to shake all the water out to prevent this, yet unit still continues to drip. If the tray organizer were about a half inch wider, it would be perfect."
2,Rusting after 3 weeks.,"Looks sharp, but it's rusting after 3 weeks of use. The brush holder fits a soap dispenser nicely. They need to make it out of aluminum or stainless steel, not this ""stainless"" steel they claim to make it out of."
5,watermelon rind,The jars were well wrapped to prevent breakage with a couple of hard candies added to the box. The sweet pickles are delicous. They came well within the listed delivery window.
4,Very Good pickles,The pickles met my expectations; they were a quality product with a sweet flavor of homemade watermelon pickles. I will buy them again.
1,deceptive product discription,The flamingo whirly gig was advertised at being of $113.00 value. Who are they trying to kid ? It is a 1 sided toy mounted on thin coat hanger legs. Amazon needs to better police what items are being sold by these sellers. I bought this for a gift. But I'm too embarrassed to give it. The wings wobble and squeal as they rotate. This is obviously a toy worth $1.13 not $ 113.oo.I will never buy from this seller again.
2,"Great idea for weight, but the finish didn't last.","I installed this sink about five years ago, based on the description of features and the look of the sink. It was easy to install, seemed well made and was light enough to manage the installation myself. Unfortunately, it just didn't perform well over time. I barely knocked a pot on the center divider and the surface chipped, showing the black underneath. The bottom of the bowl started to look worn after about 2 years with fine scratches and stains. The stains come out with BKF but you have to use it every other day to keep the sink looking clean. I even used a plastic mat in the bowl when washing dishes by hand so as not to scratch the sink, but the surface is just not as durable as necessary for daily use. I replaced the sink this week with a Blanco Silgranite, so time will tell. I would not recommend the Americast finish."
2,Pure Soap,"This is pure soap. A friendly romeo of a shopkeeper and his embittered invalid wife, a mysterious new couple (is she a witch? is he mad?), a mean-spirited vicar and his brutal rapist son, a worldly kind-hearted tart, a long-lost son, a crusading female Labour MP, a handsome idealistic ex-miner, his assorted cute siblings and, above all, a poor but honest, educated and beautiful young heroine...are you breathless yet? If so, you will enjoy following the characters as they grapple with the economic depression of the 1930s and each other. If, instead, the above chronicle left you unmoved, abandon this book to the many fans of Wendy Robertson."
5,History has never been more enjoyable,Neither has historical fiction. Harry Flashman is both. By now you are probably joining me in wishing Harry Flashman was here today. I'd vote for him to President.
2,Great game but glitchy,"A fantastic game, the best I've ever played of it's type. The feel and control are superb and the game play addicting. The only problem is it has a tendancy to crash no matter how I tweek it. I only wish the designers had made it more compatable with windows, and had cleaned up the in game glitches. Over all I had to stop playing because it just got too frustrating to keep losing my progress when the game crashed. If it was ever re-released with improvements or a ""flying hero's 2"" ever came out, I'd be first in line to buy it."
5,Yummy addition to chocolate martini!,"This item shipped quickly..Would have loved to have used it but noone wanted chocolate or peppermint drinks over Xmas. Figures. Last year when I DIDN'T have it, that's what they were into. Go figure."
2,Too small!,"This nifty looking hook will not fit onto a standard Occidental tool belt (3 inches wide.) Occidental tool belts are the construction industry standard. I am a contractor, and this hook would be very helpful to me, but oddly enough, the ""heaviest duty tool hook available"" won't fit the heaviest duty tool belt available. I think it was designed very poorly in that aspect. And if you look at the pictures, you'll see how ridiculous it is. Who wears a tool hook on their regular belt around their pants? They say it'll hold 200 pounds on their website, but the only belt capable of that is the one the hook won't fit on."
3,pretty good,does not seem as focused as earlier efforts. also doesn't sound as good. untold stories was so good on my home stereo.
5,Honest,"I was lucky enough to see Jeff at his first Australian gig at The Metro in Sydney in August '95. It was the most powerful couple of hours of live music that I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing - breathtakingly, jaw-droppingly incredible.This album is, above all else, honest. It captures the essence of a Jeff Buckley performance, warts and all - the power, the poignancy, the improvised gems - Jeff having the courage and the conviction to just go with the moment, to follow wherever the music might lead him. No gloss or pyrotechnics - just brilliant, transcendent music.There's no denying that it's pretty raw at times, but for those of us who yearned for the opportunity to see Jeff play just one more time, this is undoubtedly the next best thing.Credit also to Mary, Michael and the rest of the band for pulling together such an inspired playlist. This is a recording very much for Jeff's fans - a must have (as if I needed to tell you that)."
3,"Mammoth, yes, groundbreaking, no.","The title is a bit of a misnomer -- the stories are as much about private eyes and criminals as about police in the future.Most of the stories have a strong disoptia tone, which can be wearying after nearly 500 pages. A few stories have clever ideas or societies that I would have liked to see more of, but many seemed typical of the genre.With 30+ stories, quality varies. I didn't find much that stuck with me after putting the book down, but there was enough variety to keep me reading until the last.For the folks who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they'll like."
3,Almost...,"This book was almost satisfying. Almost! I loved the pace and the little bits of wisdom sprinkled throughout (my copy is quite dogeared for those little bits) are right up my alley. The area that was lacking for me was depth for the characters. But it was a fun ride overall, and as I am sending it along to a friend I must admit that I recommend it! Because in books, almost counts."
3,Happiness when the book ends,"I was snowed in and wanted to read a book that would make me laugh. I thought this would be it. It has a good story line that I enjoyed but it was inhibited by Ferguson's attempts to find faults with self-help books which resulted in something very close to his own version of a self help book mingled into his story line. Not that some of his advice wasn't insightful only that it was not what was expected. I kept getting fusterated when some of his ""almost preachy"" moments interfered with the story line. As long has you understand that the balance of the book is 50% self-help and 50% story you won't be disapointed."
5,"The ""Awesome"" Jester Race","This is the first In Flames album I've bought. When I listened to it, I asked myself if there could be a better death metal album. (Unfortunately) I think the answer is ""no"". Although other albums of the band are quite good ( a lot of people say that Whoracle and Colony are their best ), I don't agree that those albums have the same music quality and standards. There are super hits such as Lunar Strain, Stand Ablaze, The Hive, Colony, however they are not as good as Artifacts of the Black Rain, The Jester Dance, December Flower or Dead Eternity. So, if you have buying an In Flames album in your mind, get The Jester Race."
5,Must-have black metal,"This is some goood sh--. It sounds somewhat like Dissection only better recording, guitar is incredible, song complexity is expansive, great cd."
2,Polished and Clean?!,"This CD was my first experience with the band, and could be my last. Under recommendation I purchased the CD along with several other Death/Black Metal CDs (Mayhem, Emperor, ect.). What I discovered was not a raw hungery DARK metal sound but a refined, polished and very clean metal... almost trendy 80's. However, the musicianship was nice and the song structures very interesting, but because I was expecting power and raw meat! I was sorely disappointed. Not Death, not Black, just clean and polished. Not my bag of tea for metal."
5,Like,Purchased clay pot while stationed in Germany and this has way more recipes that guide that came with the pot.
5,Reco International Clay Cooker Cookbook,It is just as I had anticipated. I have owned My Romertopf Cookers for over 30 year I purchased them in Germany. At the time their were no cookbooks. I have started sourdough Baking and was wondering about the use of the cooker for that and they work greta. Thank you hope you publish more
3,Clay Pot Cooking Cook Book,"The book was not up to my usual Amazon purchases because it had a damaged front cover. Not huge... a small flaw on the edge of the cover.What made it bad,however,is that it was part of a Birthday gift for my wife. One part the clay pot ..... the second part the clay pot cook book. It was a bit embarrassing explaining the flaw.Bob Deddy"
1,Bad rendition of a book,I've read this book several times and really enjoyed how the characters were introduced in the book and how they grew and developed. This was lacking 100% in the movie. The characters were poorly introduce so you don't learn to love the characters The director just assumed you knew all the characters. Also the narration of the main character is dropped which plays an important roll of how Mary develops in the book. Most important part of the story was the history of the garden and why it was locked up. This is so disappointing.
2,The Secret Garden,"This item is being returned. It was a gift, and they said that it would freeze up so wouldn't play."
3,"Low-key, with one Kieslowski-like moment of epiphany.","Director Holland manages the trick of being faithful to Burnett's text - in terms of narrative, setting, character etc. - while subverting its ideological assumptions. The unobtrusive analysis of class qualifies all movement towards resolution, focusing on the excluded, working class boy rather than any restoration of aristocracy. Mary's parents in India are symptomatic of wider Imperial apathy; while the ghostly manor is an allegory for a sick, disintegrating empire.Mary the outsider in Gothdom bares the mark of 'Edward Scissorhands' writer Caroline Thompson, but Kieslowski proteges Holland and Preisner only get one chance to emulate their master, a firelit childrens' wish reaching their guardian thousands of miles away."
4,Not just for girls...,"This remake of the classic title was a disappointment at the box office and no one knows why. It's exactly what parents say they're looking for in a kids' movie. Perhaps it's because many think of it as a ""girl's movie."" We found that both boys and girls identified with characters on many levels - losing parents, being part of a family and learning to understand one another's feelings. It's a wonderful, universal story. Kids are inspired and moved by the emotions each character goes through. They commented: ""No matter what your problems are, you can overcome them."" ""It must have been shot in a big garden. It was neat."" ""Awesome, it was the best video ever!"" Best for 7 to 12-year-olds."
5,How to keep a Secret....,"""The secret garden"" movie...bought through Amazon, is a lovely rendition of the classic story much appreciated by my 9 year old granddaughter who loved it as much as she loved reading the book.... The life of 2 different children collide and unfold beautifully despite adult restrictions, ending harmoniously for all concerned."
2,Inferior to BBC version,"This version of The Secret Garden should be titled ""Ms. Burnett goes to Hollywood"". It's overwrought and clichéd. If one has been raised on a steady diet of Saturday morning cartoons, this film will appeal. Otherwise, get the BBC version. While it was obviously made with a much lower budget, the BBC version is FAR more faithful to the original story, the actors have the correct regional accents, and it captures the magic much better."
4,MMJ Decent,I sort of first loved them and then they do get somewhat droany. They also sound somewhat like the chill flaming lips. Its the best in moderation not an album to keep on repeat nevertheless the musit is very pretty. A few tracks really seem to stik out from MMJ esp golden and I will song you songs
1,Too country for me,"If you like country or alt country, you may like this. If you really don't, then steer clear. It's good for what it is, but really not my style, so I hated it."
3,"part o' dis, part o' dat","good stuff, but derivative.A little bit Neil Young, a little bit Rick Danko. Catchy tunes, slow and mellow and a little sad; music to curl up with on a cold night with a nice bottle of tequilla, a fire, and just yourself. Sound quality is iffy: guitars are a little too jangly, mix is not quite right on a few songs. But, hey, whatever gets you through the night."
4,It Still Moves by My Morning Jacket,"Reminiscent, if I may, of the Allman Brothers and The Band, and to a lesser extent, Neil Young. It's a little more polished than those guys, with really nice choral flourishes, reminiscent of Pink Floyd maybe? What contemporary band would I compare My Morning Jacket to?I heard a review of the album on NPR and then went and bought it. Ever since then I've wanted to start a band called Several Pairs of Shoes. Ha ha ha ha."
2,seventy-one long minutes,"""Raw?"" ""Energetic""? ""In your face""?I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things.Energy level is close to that of ""The Trinity Sessions"", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever.Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush.Coming soon to garage sales all over the country."
5,Rock and roll throwbacks strike again...,"The usual Neil Young comparisons will be thrown around, but also think Bob Dylan, circa John Wesley Harding and The Band... it has that ""Old Weird America"" feel of The Basement Tapes, but is much denser and fuller sounding, and Jimmy James' voice is pretty unique, and reason enough to dig this music.""One Big Holiday"" is a personal favorite, but every song is terrific, and ""Mahgeeta"" (sp?) has a really great fake ending with roaring, building guitars fading into drums and cowbell (!), then coming back with the full band and rocking a little more before ending.In short, it's terrific, and I know my attempts to come up with apt comparisons don't do it justice. If you like rock music at all, this will be one of your favorite albums of 2003."
4,Nice reminder....,Cute book. It's a nice reminder...not just for your kids but for adults too. Sometimes we need to be reminded to look at the bright side of things and not to search for things to be angry about.
5,Great book,"This book is very funny - my roommates and I would read it whenever one of us had a bad day, and it always cheered us up. The illustrations are especially great - lots of detail."
3,This short is OK for the beginner,"When my wife bought me this short, I thought it was great. It was definitely better than the regular short that I used. She then bought me another short-a Pearl Izumi Classic 3D short. She paid $10 more for the Pearl Izumi. Well....I no longer use the Aerotech short anymore. My precious you-know-what got a little numb with the aerotech short after about 5 miles. The Pearl Izumi provided me with the comfort and protection for a much much longer ride. The quality is so much better for only $10 extra. The moral of the story is: spend a little more and not having remorse. The Pearl Izumi opened my mind to other great (and expensive) brands. The quality, design, and comfort that the more expensive brands offer is definitely worth it to me. Instead of trying to block the discomfort out of my brain, I can now concentrate on my workout!"
4,Very Good On Balance,"I had taped this off of Bravo or another channel back in the day, but have not watched it for years, especially since I haven't owned a VHS player since 1998 or thereabouts. It's as good or better than I remember, especially in our modern world of 5.1 sound. Definitely an interesting look into the making of an album and the controversial (at the time) change in direction for Sting. The person who decided that the credits should roll OVER Sting while he does a solo performance of Message In A Bottle during the encore should be locked in a room with one donut and Rosie O'Donnell. Seriously?? There's not enough space on this flipping DVD to roll the credits on a black screen?? You gotta do it over arguably the most iconic song in modern pop history? Good looking out, producers..."
2,Sting during his pretentious phase .......,"Probably my own fault but I hadn't realized that this is a quite early video dating from the period not long after Sting left Police. It isn't a full length rock concert - it is more of a documentary - and it was probably very enjoyable in its day. However, it isn't much of a spectacle as a Blu-ray offering and I'm afraid that, despite being a fan of Sting and his work, I just didn't enjoy his persona in this recording. Maybe Blu-ray has just the raised the bar on recent recordings and hence, in comparison to other offerings, my expectations were not met here. Most Sting fans will like this but will probably also own the DVD already - there is nothing in my mind to justify the increased cost of Blu-ray."
1,I want my money back,"Nothing irrates me more than having a concert interrupted. I know this is a documentary of sorts, but there should be a way to watch the ENTIRE concert from beginning to end without cutting back to the 'documentary' sections. Its bad enough that the interruptions happen in between songs, but it is inexcusable to cut to an interview IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG. I've owned the CDs of the concert since they came out and have enjoyed listening to them ever since. I was very excited to get this on BluRay, thinking I'd be able to enjoy the concert. However, this is a waste of time and a waste of money. I want my $20 back."
2,Not as entertaining as the others!,"My preshooler (3.5 yrs old) has recently discovered MSB and is now hooked on it. It is the only thing he wants to watch. But not this one! This one did not get the kind of enthuastic response that the others (the Bee Hives, Salmon, Lunch (Arnold's digestive system), etc.) got."
1,How did we get to this point?,"In a world of great technological improvements, this movie is proof that the horror/suspense movie genre is actually DEVOLVING. How did we get from Hitchcock to Final Destination? Poorly scripted, poorly acted -- the list goes on and on. The opening plane sequence is well-staged, but from there this movie spirals out of control, piling implausibility upon implausibility. One of the worst movies I've ever seen, in any genre -- this movie is a waste of 90 minutes of your life."
3,Glossy horror flick.,"Final Destination starring Devon Sawa and Ali Larter is pretty far-fetched but enjoyable to watch. Some of the death scenes are out of this world, too gory and disgusting. The first half of the film is the best but the rest drags and never picks up speed again. I recommend watching this film but stay away from the sequel, it's truly horrendous."
3,Do you believe??,Do you believe that there is some other force out there that will seal your fate... Watch this movie and you will.
2,Could have been good,"""Final Destination"" contains some of the silliest death scenes I have ever seen. I actually held out a little hope that it would be at least a little bit above average given its premise. But, no it is a typical, by-the-numbers game of ""who's next?"" If that's what you're looking for then have at it. I guess I just shouldn't have bothered. The movie I really wanted has already been made. Rent ""Fearless"" instead. Its a serious explorarion of how it might feel to cheat death."
2,"the beginning was cool, but after the plane crash, blah!","there's not much to say about this movie. it's just a bunch of pretty teens running from death because they were also meant to die in the plane, ok whatever. so, the rest of this movie is over an hour of teens running around, looking attractive and getting killed in the most silly ways. yeah, the director tried to make the deaths brutal, but with the cgi effects, it just looks dumb and phony. the 70's-80's horror movies that had all these death scenes looked a lot more realistic, even the real cheesy ones. they looked a lot better than this i assure you. also, none of the deaths come to you with suspence, it's the same formula over and over. formula=one false scare, then the real thing. for example: boy plugs in radio, water seeps up to him, no not an electicution, instead boy slips on water and gets strangled by a cord, and repeat about 5-6 more times and there's the formula for the deaths."
2,could been better,i had high hopes for this movie.unfourntely what could of been a great permise is made stupid by annoying streotyped teen chacters. the death scenes are gross like when the guys end gets chop off. i like the movies when just the suggestion of the death is enough.the end is also terrible. what i really think is that the movie goes down hill after the plane explodes.with better chacters the couldof been good.
2,Great movie,I liked the movie a lot. I saw it several years ago and it's one that I would see again.
2,This movie is down right hysterical,"Forget terror, this movie had me more afraid that I may hurt myself laughing than concerned about the fate of the characters. After a very smart opening, the movie spirals into one obsurdity after another. If you're looking to be scared, forget it. However, if you want to laugh, not just at the movie, but the fact that someone actually sat down to write this, then see the movie. The only scary thing about it is that it took three people to come up with this drivel. I gave the movie two stars because humor is not deliberate. It has to take you by surprise. And if the filmakers meant for this movie to be funny they certainly did a good job."
2,"Well, it made me laugh.","I saw this movie in the theaters, and saw it again (not by choice) on DVD. Both times I felt that the film was more of a comedy than anything else. Anyone with any sense could predict what was going to happen next.And that's the good part, because at least it was funny! The acting was terrible, the special effects stunk, and it was just an overall bad film."
2,Too big and heavy,I got these shoes in a 9 and they were just too big. I have to wear two pairs of socks. They are also very heavy.
2,My kettle also rusted.,"Like the other reviewer, my kettle rusted. It took about 6-8 months for rust to develop, but now every cup of tea from it tastes like an iron supplement.This is very disappointing because I, too, have generally found this line to be of high quality and was surprised to find rust so early. Back to my humble Korean stainless steel kettle from Freecycle...The enameled finish also chipped on the exterior without any obvious accidents/bashings. I'm not sure what happened here."
5,You'll Never Get Rich,"If you appreciate, Fred Astaire, You will really enjoy this movie . There are stunning dance scenes with Astaire & Rita Hayworth that are exciting as well as equisite. The plot is often very humorous & takes place on an Army base during WWII..It is a very enjoyable film to watch and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys fabulous dancing & the era of the 40's."
3,No classic but the stars shine,"This cross between a backstage musical and a service comedy isn't one of either star's greats, but it nestles rather comfortably in the middle of their cvs as the kind of glossily executed forgettable studio fayre that fills in an hour-and-a-half pleasantly enough. The title sequence is probably the most memorable thing about it - the credits appearing as roadside signs - and the initial mistaken identity plot could have just as been tailored for Fred and Ginger, but Hayworth is particularly stunning to look at and Robert Benchley offers good comedic support as our hero's duplicitous producer. Columbia's general stodginess with musicals is not quite so apparent here, although with the exception of a guardhouse solo the numbers do lack the panache of the RKO or MGM films. Nonetheless, it's still light and amiable formulaic entertainment.Columbia's DVD has a decent but not outstanding print and includes the original theatrical trailer"
3,A disappointing Cole Porter musical,"Despite a promising combination of talent in providing the film score (Cole Porter) and principals (Fred Astaire paired for the first time with Rita Hayworth) I never found this movie really held my attention. There were no hit songs, though `Dream dancing' and the appropriately titled `So near yet so far' came closest. The dancing was excellent and Hayworth proved herself to be at least as able a talent as Ginger Rogers. The ensemble number `Wedding Cake Walk' that was staged by Robert Alton was also quite memorable; but this was not a film I would rush to see again. I felt the Astaire-Hayworth pairing worked much better in You Were Never Lovelier.You Were Never Lovelier"
3,NOT FOR COPS ONLY...,"This is a book about cops, for cops, and by cops. The author has done an excellent job of organizing their stories about what it means be a member of the blue team. There are over a hundred such accounts compiled, and each one has a ring of authenticity, colored by a layer of humor and cynicism that goes often goes with the territoty. The often raw and gritty language, coupled with their vividly described experiences, gives the reader a birdseye view of the underbelly of the beast.The only problem with the book is that policing has undergone a substantial change in the past several years, which is, of course, not reflected in this book, as it was published in 1985. Read in that context, the book is somewhat anachronistic. Still, it is one that will be enjoyed by those with a penchant for police war stories. If you are an avid cop buff, add one star to my rating."
2,No BS...,"I think it's funny that in the intro to this text, the authors criticize other project management books for rambling on and including lots of ""BS,"" because that is EXACTLY what these authors do anyway!! Ultimately, the main reason I was ok with paying so much for such a useless book is that I got a ""free"" copy of microsoft project with it. Other than that, I'd say it was NOT money well spent."
2,Project Management,"This is the hardest text book to follow that I have ever had. But,it does contain a wealth of information"
2,Cure for Insomnia,"I don't know what is worse, my Instructor or this text.The authors re-define ""babble"" in this book. It's quite a compendium of sleep inducing theory that never ends. They repeat and define concepts over and over. The chapters are a long and wordy. I can't wait till this semester is over so I can unload this hundred dollar tome of esoteric Project Management lexicon and ""theory"".."
3,mr.,"Please i need the recept of the previous purchase items. i.e., Project Management.Billing Addres as follow:Samson Abraha7501 quincewood ctderwood, MD 20855Thank You!"
2,A Primer and VERY Boring,"Okay so we all know that PM books can be pretty dry and boring, but wow is this text a snoozer. The case studies are excellent, but general concepts are muddled between the author's opinions, babble, and history lessons.If you are looking for concepts, facts, examples, and down to earth solutions to common problems, then look elsewhere. Wayyyyy too much babble. I wouldn't use this text for the PMP exam. If youre a ""get to the point"" kinda guy...this text will continually annoy you.For the academic classroom its okay only, but get ready to explain concepts and shorten the history lesson. Nice Dilbert inserts, MS Project explainations, and earned value analysis though. :)"
4,easy simple solution,"I've had this adapter on my son's desktop for over 6 months. I wanted an easily removable adapter, so I could remove it if internet interfered with homework. The install was fine; I always find it easiest to install updated drivers from the website rather than the install disc. they are always outdated. So I downloaded the drivers onto a jump drive on my pc, then installed them onto his pc. Attached the usb adapter and set windows zero config to run the wireless and it has worked flawlessly ever since. I did not install the Client software that came with the adapter. I use StatBar to monitor my access (freeware). I have not had issues with overheating as mentioned by others. The unit is powered up 10 hours a day. I like having the extension cable so we can aim it towards our router (2wire). I recommend it as a simple upgrade as long as you install only the drivers from the website and use Windows to configure."
4,Early 90s Fans Rejoice!,"Its as if Stereo Mcs didnt take a break. As accessible as Connected, if not more, Deep plummets into crunchy, funky beats without being too much or not enough. ""We Belong In This World Together"" is a must hear for any fan who still believed a comeback would happen. The title track beeps and blips itself into your heart, while ""Sophisticated"" just simply makes you smile. While these songs wont win over everybody and break much ground in the world of laptops, drum machines, 20 or so soul singers, and vocoders, it will definitely win over those kids who dug ""Connected"" all 1,000 times they played it on MTV, K-Mart, and your favorite tv commercial. Thats deep, man."
1,This is a bad movie,"I'd give this movie ZERO stars if I could.... Is it Vulgar...yes, is it ""Madcap""...yes...is it Funny?????? NOOOOOOO I got this Blu-ray for free and frankly, I much rather have the 2 hours (or whatever it was) back in my life.The first movie had some funny stuff in it, nothing to go wild about, but this one makes the first movie look like an all time Comedy classic by comparison. Save your money and your time."
1,Horrible,Please don't waste your time. There is nothing funny or entertaining about this movie. The characters have no depth or backstory or commonsense.
2,Two Stars for the Monkey,"I saw the first one and liked it. But, after watching this one, I feel as stupid as that Allen character. The scenes with the Monkey are worth watching, hence two stars. The Monkey was the only intelligent being in this film -- on and behind the scenes. Save your time and money and skip this movie."
1,SO NOT FUNNY,It was 1 hour and 12 minutes into the movie before i ever laughed...The 1st movie was really funny..this one...NOT
1,worse than a pirated film,"the whole movie is shaking, the sound is fine, but the image keeps jumping throughout the movie. never had this problem beforeThe Hangover Part II (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]"
1,this movie sucked...,this movie was the worst that i seen this year and that saids alot considering the movies thats been out...i dont think they new the difference between stupid and funny they should of stopped with the first one...
2,Disappointing,"The original ""Hangover"" was hilarious. ""Hangover Part II"" got only a couple of giggles. I give it a disappointing 2 giggles."
2,They should have left Hangover Part I alone.,"Just like everybody else is saying: They should have just left the first Hangover alone as a classic in its own right...but they HAD to try to copy the same formula and almost un-originally make a part II that was just a carbon copy and LESS funny. The movie really sucked....and it was so predictable. Sure...the first one had its crazy and unrealistic moments...but it was still kind of believable in most parts. This one just takes it even further and many of the scenes are so unbelievable it's not even worth writing about. I don't even want to waste too much time writing about how disappointing this was. It's just like Grease 2.....a HORRIBLE follow-up to a classic (well, kind of a classic)."
3,DON'T PLAN ON THE UV COPY TO WORK ON ITUNES,"Overall, I think this is a great movie, if your expectations are similar to the original. My biggest problem is the stupid UltraViolet copy that comes along with. It does not allow you to download in iTunes. It downloads to some crappy app called Flixster. I use Apple TV to watch movies and that is not possible with UltraViolet digital copies. I am not buying any actual dvds because of this. Extremely unhappy on Christmas because my parents have a Apple TV and no blu-ray. Thanks Warner Brothers for ruining Christmas."
1,an embarrassment to the acting and movie making community,"We rented this movie to unwind after the long Christmas weekend. The writers, editors, filmaker, actors (and i use this term only as an adjective, for there are no actors in this movie)publisher and producers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this kind of sloppily finished product out for the public. Not only does it insult the average person's intelligence, it slams whats left of todays morals by their crude shock and awe language and images. Shame Shame Shame. It is pretty sad when one stoops this low to make a buck; at another's expense; giving nothing back, stealing what they can get. If I had read the reviews I would not have rented this trashed vulgar movie; the only good thing from it is the lesson i wont forget for a long long time, read the reviews before buying."
2,Could've Been Better,The second Hangover does not come close to the original Hangover movie. It is basically the same storyline but not as funny. Only watch it if you definitely don't have anything else to do.
1,waste of time & money,The movie is NOT funny. It is also very vulgar. Sorry I purchased it. I thought it would be like the first but I was so very wrong. I threw it in the trash.
2,HANGOVER PART 2,Don't bother with this one. It is nothing like the first HANGOVER. Some funny parts but not enough to buy it OR rent it. DISAPPOINTED
2,"Decent movie, ultraviolet sucks","Movie is pretty good. Reused some jokes from first one that made them less funny. Ultraviolet sucks. I will never use it.I use audials tunebite 9. Let's me legally store DVDs on all my devices, copy them, and convert formats as I want for my own home use."
3,"Decent, but the first is better","The Hangover 2 is a mildly entertaining case of deja vu since a lot of the film is as if Todd Phillips just simply edited the script of the original and replaced the tiger with a monkey and the baby with a monk in a wheel chair. While the wolf pack ""Phil, Stu and Alan"" go through similar stages of hell in about the same order as they did in the first. Then when the film realizes it left out Mike Tyson, even he's lazily thrown in there for the hell of it.Yet, I can't say I kept my eyes off the screen through-out the Hangover 2. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are a fun trio to hangout with even if the same material all over again is a waste of their talents. But if Phillips decides to make a part 3, he needs to be much more creative than simply just giving us similar situations...in the same order."
2,Same as number 1,"This movie was the same movie as number 1. I liked the first one too, but it would have been nice not to see the exact same movie just in a different country."
2,Disappointing,"The first movie was great, hit it out of the park. I had high hopes for this movie, but it didn't come close to meeting them. I bought this for $3.00 with $2.98 shipping, its a movie that i think is worth four of five dollars, but I wanted it off my wish list so I picked it up. I doubt there will be a third, but if so they need to listen to the audience of the second movie and highly improve how they are going to do it... there is so much room improvement. I would recommend this movie to someone who hasn't seen it yet and has a open afternoon with nothing on TV and nothing else to do anywhere else."
3,Not as good as the first one,"Not as funny as the first one, but I would still buy it. It is still good and has the same characters. I laughed more the second time I watched it. The sequel to most movies aren't as good as the first, so I wasn't disappointed."
1,Ultraviolet Nonsense,"Ultraviolet copies should not be able to have the ""digital copy"" logo on them. As there is no copy only streaming. This is so weak on the part of the studio. I'll hold off, and in 6 months I'll buy the Blu-Ray on Amazon for $9.99, and I'll also buy it on iTunes for $9.99 and I'll have EXACTLY what I want and Ultraviolet can piss-off. The movie is 5 Stars, it is amazingly funny."
1,Ultraviolet ruins it for me!,"I will pass on this and just download from iTunes. Ultra violet does not work with all my stuff. I tried Horrible Bosses, but gave up. Movie was not great, but good enough to purchase."
1,Don't waste your time,This is just an excuse for a sequel and has no redeeming qualities. The characters have been robbed of their personalities and the humor is non-existant. Very disappointing.
1,Awful!,"I usually loooooove movies like this...but this was awful. Every.single.joke.went too far. I saw the first one and thought it was pretty good, that scene where they woke up in the hotel room is a CLASSIC. This movie was pretty much lewd and crude, but with no substance to back it up. Skip it and see Horrible Bosses instead."
1,Terrible product do not buy,The Ultraviolet digital copy does not play on the iPad. Very disappointed in the product it failed to meet my requirement. I hate to say this but should have ordered from iTunes. Old digital copy porcess was easy to use. There is zero help with Flixster and Ultrviolet issues you are stuck with a worthless product.If you wish to use digital copy find another source.
4,Hot...,"I obviously bought this CD for the song Shackles, but there's even a song that I like better called Be Happy; Still my child is also a beautiful song. This is a really good CD, although not perfect, and these girls have some beautiful voices. They remind me of Trinitee 5:7, but with better song writing. I recommed this CD for anyone, whether or not you listen to Gospel, It can really touch your life. I look forward to future projects from Mary Mary."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I was not impressed with Mary Mary's debut cd. I expected the songs to be of higher quality. All of the songs sort of sounded alike. There was nothing about the songs, the voices, or the music to really grab my attention. I listen to secular and gospel music, so it's not like I'm a gospel ""purist"". Even the song they did with Destiny's Child was weak to me. I hate to say it, but this is not a very good cd in my opinion. Hopefully their next effort will be worth the hype."
2,Too Many Fillers,"This album started out well until we get to 'King Creole', then it falters badly with a bunch of forgettable movie tunes thrown in to fill out the album. Towards the end, it improves again with the exception of 'Roustabout' which sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. Volumes are not stable either throughout this album. Very disappointing compared to vol. 1. Expectations were not as high as most of his really good recordings were on the former."
5,Not Even 2nd to Elv1s,"In my opinion, this CD/Album is the best of the two greatest hits compilations. This CD features numerous songs with Elvis at the peak of his performing prowess. My personal favorites are:If I Can Dream - A masterpiece from the 1969 special.Always On My Mind - Long Before Willie Nelson, Elvis made this song magic.Loving You - How was this not a number one song?You Don't Have To Say You Love Me - An underrated gem.A 5 star CD!"
5,A must have!!!,"If you dont have the cd ""One"" yet buy it and buy ""2nd to none"" also. This is the follow up to ""One"" and contains some great songs, I enjoy this one ever more than ""One"". Elvis died the yr after I was born but he is an influence now more than ever. He will always be the king and this cd just proves that you cant fit all of the great songs even on 2 cds. I will be waiting for a third one. ELVIS lives!"
4,"Good, but weak about tropical soils","I'm an agronomist.Here in Brazil, I read this book.This book is long and has many informations.Every agronomist must read, a book such as this.At least in ediction that I read, this book has a big failure.This book is weak about tropical soils.For american reality, I think this book deserves 5 stars.Well, I live in Brazil.I'll give four stars for it."
5,"Insightful Book, Opened my Eyes to Acts","I bought this book looking for something to enhance my quiet time, something that I could read the Bible along with. I chose it pretty randomly, and ended up loving it so much that just today I bought another book in the 'Preaching the Word' series. This book really brought to life the early church for me, and continued to ignite feelings in me that the contemporary church just doesn't have it figured out at all. It's a great thing to read in the mornings with a bowl of cereal and your Bible. :)"
5,Nice,She looks great in these and really makes her legs pop. What are you waiting for buy them and you will not be disappointed.
3,Nice,"It's about what I expected, having played every previous iteration of this software. It's addictively fun.Thank you, Loki, for porting it to Linux!"
5,the tampa boys know how to whoop-de-do it,brutality is one band of many that knows how to whoop-de-do it. hope they come back with a new album
2,Sick of the same old same old,Man i don't understand what is going on here. I was in another band in Philadelphia named Brutallity and we were so much more talented and artistic than this. It really gets me burned when I see someone get signed who's songs sound the same as well as their riffs from alblum to alblum. Please if your gonna write an alblum and put it out please put some creative thought into it. Thanks
3,A Mixed-Bag,"I prefer the Balkans/Turkish Gypsy sound. This is an interesting mix of Mediterranean and Central/East European sounds. Tracks #3,4, 9, 10, 12 were the sound I prefer. The Albanian group Kurbeti was my favorite. The Iberian and Russian sounds a very different from the Balkan style."
1,What the?,"I have been a HUGE Jayhawks fan for a long time. This record, unfortunately, misses in a big way. I have no problem with bands trying to ""spread their wings"" or explore new musical soundscapes, but this is just a mismatch, plain and simple. The songwriting suffers, the production is bland and embarassingly close to sellout, and if it didn't say ""Jayhawks"" on the front cover I wouldn't know which cut-and-paste band of the week I was listening to.This can't be the same band that created the beauty of Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass. Instead of beautiful melodies we get boring, unoriginal riffs and (shudder) drum machines. Fine for some bands, but the Jayhawks do NOT play to their strengths on this one. There are a couple of nice songs, but I can't bear to listen to this thing straight through."
1,Will not hold plates!,"I should have read the reviews before I bought. It will not hold dinner plates. The vendor was wonderful about the return, though."
5,Durable and Worthy,"Very good quality. Folds neatly to put away, and very durable as far as the weight I put on it for drying, pots pans,etc. Holds many items and can be cleaned by washing on a lite cycle in dishwasher!"
1,Don't Buy This Item,"I wish I had payed attention to the negative reviews I read about this product before I ordered it. I found this rack wouldn't hold plates larger than an 8 1/2 inch luncheon plate, making it useless for draining dishes. I returned it to Stacks and Stacks and it was delivered to them on May 1 but as of May 12, I still haven't received a credit for the return. If I do receive a credit, it will be of little value to me because it cost about $14 for the return postage. I seriously considered just putting it into the garbage, but didn't think Stack & Stack should be able to sell this product without any repercussion."
5,All I can say is WOW!,"This is possibly the best book I've read in years. I found out about this through a friend of mine and I was reluctant at first. Now I'm kicking myself for waiting as long as I did! This book was so good that I bought a copy for pratically everyone I know for Christmas.This book is exicting, has an original story, interesting plot, solid writing, well drawn characters, and is a real page turner. As good as this book is, I couldn't believe that it's not on a Bestseller list. Truly an awesome find. I would recommend this book to anyone."
4,Completely enjoyable for kids of all ages (including over 18,"I first saw this movie 8 years ago with my two children. We all loved and watched it time and again. I have now introduced it to my 6 year old son who, like his older sisters, enjoys it enormously."
5,Memory's a Bit Blurry and Admittedly Biased.,"First off, I used to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks when I was younger, whether it be by television or VHS tapes. I actually didn't care for some of the characters (Alvin, his female counterpart Brittany, and how Dave is always clueless) but the songs more than made up for it. When this movie first appeared on TV, I tried to catch as much as possible, and was instantly hooked. The songs were catchy with lovable lyrics, easy for young children to sing for hours afterwards, and, of course, the underlying message of strong family bonds throughout the entire second half of the movie. I can only hope that, one day, my children will enjoy watching this marvelous movie as much as I did."
5,WHAT A CLASSIC! THE CHIPMUNKS ARE!,THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE IS ONE OF THE OLD FASHION MOIVE THAT I LOVE. THE CHIPMUNKS CAN BE FUN BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC THAT YOUR SON OR DAUTHER WILL LOVE TO SING AND DANCE TO. THE CHIPMUNKS ARE NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN ITS FOR BOTH YOUNGE AND OLD ITS A GREATE FAMILY MOVIE FOR ALL SOME OF THE SONGS THAT YOULL LOVE ARE BOYS OF ROCK AND ROLL WOLLY BULLY I YI YI YI AND A BUNCH MORE. NOW BUY THE MOVIE AT A LOW PRICE AND HAVE FUN!!@$
4,Alvin and the Chipmunks - The Chipmunk Adventure,This is one of my favorite movies from childhood! I must have had good taste then because it is still great.
5,It is a great movie.,I loved The Chipmunk Adventure ever since I was litte and I still like it. I have the movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I think that they should make a sequal to this movie and keep on making movies about alvin and the chipmunks. It was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it. I am a chipmunk fan.
5,Overlooked Classic,"Clint Eastwood has made more than few great movies, however this is very underated and overlooked. Eastwood plays cop with few city miles on him but what makes flim great is that, unlike his other cop roles, he has certain vulnerablility to him. Sure he's a badass be hes damaged and seems like he is searching for redemption by trying to complete a suicide mission. Sandra Locke, who Eastwood was married to in real life, plays the street smart, heart of gold hooker to perfection. This movie is full of action with a great story and its all done in classic 70's style."
4,nice product,This works very well in our new cabinets. I liked it so much I am doing all my shelves in this.
4,Useful Workbook,"The book is great and my teacher recommended, The price is good but the only thing it was that I had to erased every answer. Thanks God the previous owner wrote it with a pencil."
3,Primitive Italian Prog.,"I must admit, I found their late nineties release, Exit, far more appealing than this 1973 effort. The difference between the two is that after twenty five years they developed a much keener sense of melody and used the prog arrangements to enhance the delivery of the compositions. On Zarathustra it often sounds like an exercise in jamming on vaguely related themes. I found the musicianship to be somewhat dated and the vocals somewhat strained. It's not bad just not ""classic Italian prog"" as other reviewers would suggest. I much prefer the 70's output of PFM or Banco Del Mutuo Soccorso where composition reigned King. If you enjoyed the first Banco recording, Le Orme's Collage or Balleto's Ys you may like this one. Proceed with caution...Simon"
2,Didn't like it.,"He did a poor job describing the battle scenes, and he spent a lot of time trying to get out of battle. I heard The Old Breed is much better."
5,helmet for my pillow,Great book. I couldn't put it down until I was done. Now I'm using it to cross reference it with Guadalcanal Diary an The old Breed. It works.
4,Leckie's War,"I came to read ""Helmet for my Pillow"" through the outstanding portrayal of Leckie by the actor James Badge Dale in the series ""The Pacific."" Leckie dominates the early parts of the series, giving Dale and the writers plenty of space to fill out Leckie's character as it develops during the trials of Guadalcanal, New Britain and Peleliu. He is a warrior and good soldier, literate and loyal to friends, as well as rebellious, cantankerous and irritating. I wonder how Leckie's family feel about the film, though it is much kinder to Leckie than his own account of his adventures during those early campaigns in the south Pacific. The omissions and condensations in the film are understandable and do not contradict the spirit of the book. I am grateful to Tom Hanks and the others who have spent so lavishly of time and resources to bring this story to the screen, to actor Dale for his masterful recreation of Leckie, and to Robert Leckie himself for writing this remarkable book."
5,WWII...,"After watching the movie version first (Pacific), I was compelled to read Leckie's book. I followed the book and movie the second time around, GREAT STUFF!"
4,Good follow up to HBO series.,After watching the TV series I was eager to read this book and it meet my expectations.
5,Good deal,The ghillie works very well and order a size up to be able to make a gun rag out of the extra material
4,Personalizes An Issue,"It's easy to feel empathy and fear for these kids, especially the girls. But it's even easier to feel rage at the parents and grandmothers, who often sabotage a tiny window of escape. For sensitive viewers, I find it necessary to reveal there are a couple of happy endings but several that probably will not be."
5,Interesting and fun to read,"This is a great story well told, about somebody who put poison in the church coffee. It should be a movie."
1,A Disappointment,"This seems to be a writer in search of a plot. I couldn't finish the book. I found the writing and the premise amateurish. The author also chose to make up ""composite"" detectives who use fictionalized dialogue to provide information. That doesn't work in journalism and it doesn't work in ""true crime."" Plus, the technique made it difficult to understand what was really happening. Pick a different genre."
1,"Fluffy fiction, at best","Disappointing piece of unilateral journalistic dribble. Author was obviously spoon-fed anecdotes and suppositions from New Sweden's answer to Miss Marple, and then felt compelled to expound on them. Does any reader of this book find relevance in what Stan carries for inventory in his store?The holier-than-thou perspective of certain church members would seemingly be better utilized in helping to clean up the ""trucker mouths"" of some of the parishioners instead of spying on others. This is a church after all.Reader does not recommend this book."
2,A good historical fiction,"Even though I sound skeptical about this book being a work of good scientific research, I did enjoy it as reading like historical fiction. There are too many books that clearly and succinctly cover the areas this book does, with facts to back up the prose, which is not sufficient here for me to believe that there was a secret paprii that Carnahan had completely distorting history as we have had it thrust at us. It is a fact that history is in the eye of the beholder, but this goes beyond what I can accept as fact, but I did enjoy it. I recommend this book to anyone who can read it with a grain of salt, some speculation and just plain enjoyment for the manner in which the history of this time has been manipulated."
2,"Mostly shine, not much substance","I am sorry to say I saw this book on a book list and asked my then girlfriend to buy it for me...what a waste of birthday wish. The author spends FAR too much time explaining the book of Exodus, offering no new insights whatsoever."
3,good,low end board. very good for average use. I wish i would have splurged for the higher end price boards.
4,Clonepocalypse Now,Star wars meets Apocalypse Now. The whole book I couldn't help but picture Samuel Jackson with a lightsaber on a boat in Vietnam looking for a female Marlon Brando (with a lightsaber). But a pretty good read.
3,Not Your Typical Star Wars Novel,"I was torn as to whether to give this book three or four stars, so I guess it's a 3.5 star in my eyes. It starts out making Mace Windu seem pretty weak. I don't quite buy all of his actions either. It seems they based his character more on his other personas in the numerous other films he's done in his career rather than basing his character on the fact that he's so high ranking in the jedi council.So overall, it's definitely not the best Star Wars novel out there, but I did enjoy reading it. The shear brutality of it was unexpected and made it much more interesting, and that's why it got the rating it did. If I based it purely on being a Star Wars novel, I'd have given it two stars."
5,Be ready to be surprised,"I absolutely loved this because it was amazing how surprised a SW geek can be. Windu has always been one of the most ""human"" of the Jedi to me, not so disconnected from reality. This book proves it, he shows the good, the bad, and the ugly of himself and the Jedi Order in general. The most exciting by far is just the ""newness"" (love my vocab?) of the book, how it makes everything and everyone seem new."
3,"Okay, but not as good as I'd hoped","I had Shatepoint recomended to me. Not having much time to read I bought the audio version. I don't know if it was the abridgement, but this book lacked something. Plus, the ending seemed very abrupt still leaving me with some questions."
4,"Very entertaining, but definitely for adults","Right off the bat, this Star Wars novel is not like the typical Star Wars novel. It's written for adults. There's some pretty gruesome violence throughout and it deals with some pretty mature topics.This, however, makes Shatterpoint stand out. Focusing on Mace Windu, a dark character himself, creates a lot of tension in the story. There's a lot of insight into Mace's character. A fun aspect deals with his guilt over how the battle of Geonosis turned out. After reading the book, I felt like I understood Mace better in the films, and some of his smaller nuances had much more meaning.Matthew Stover has become my favorite Star Wars writer. His Revenge of the Sith adaptation was infinitely better than the movie version, and his Luke Skywalker and the Shadows of Mindor was a great follow up to Return of the Jedi. He has a knack for not only nailing the characters from the movies, but expanding upon them. I highly recommend all of his books, including this one."
4,Collin Raye /Tracks,"This is a wonderful album. Collin Rayes ability to deliver a ballad is unmatched.His vocals on Tracks show that even the best can improve.The best song on the album is ""Harder Cards"". A well written , well delivered song. Rayes soaring vocals on ""Completely"" leave you drained. One thing that I was hopeing for before hearing this album , was that I would hear more upbeat tunes. Collin usually fills his albums with too many ballads. This album is no differant. Far too many ""Fillers""-- boring ballads with too many ""hooks""! But , overall, this album is a good one. I do recommend it --even if you're not a Collin Raye fan."
4,"Not bad, worth the money for a simple wide angle","Basically this works by screwing onto the end of your lens like a filter. There is a conversion ring for the Cannon lens, a 58 series VII (46mm to 58mm) adapter. It does open up the wide angle aspect of the lens, but it also cuts down on the light you are getting. I think with the faster 50mm lens it gives you a really nice wide angle lens that isn't as dark.As for the Macro aspects, not really any better than the stock lens. Also a pure wide angle or fisheye is probably better, but the price on this was right for what I wanted. Haven't shot much with it yet, but so far it looks okay."
3,There is no 5-pack from Recording Store,This company ships late and also puts two loose tapes and a 3-pack in a box. They are not selling the 5-pack so if you are like me who uses the 5-pack box for catagorizing then do not buy from them. Or buy two 3-packs.The tape is good but look into the HDM-63VG tapes from Sony also. I have had good results from those.
4,mini HD Videi Cassette,It is hard to review because I won't know the quality of the product until I have had a chance to use it which won't be for one month But it was deliverd in a very timely manner. And appears to be fine.
4,Webkinz Pink Pony,"My granddaughter loves this pony! The website associated with it is educational and she learns how to take care of her pony with feeding, brushing, excercising and housing it."
2,The book is too basic,The book is too basic and lacks real content but it would be good as a primer to westerners. However there are many other books available which are much better still for introductions
1,Standard,"This book shows no understanding. It is probably not even written by a Chinese. I bought the book cause I thought it was autenthic. I feel like I've wasted my money. After contacting Eric Yudelove about this, and visiting his website, I realised that this guy has more mental problems than the average joe blow. You are welcome to see for yourself and the complaints at this guys website."
1,A Break With Charity Review- Michael Jenn Annie Jason Sandra,"A Break With CharityOur Rating: :( Two thumbs downAnn Rinaldi's historical fiction, A Break With Charity, is about an adolescent girl's view of the Salem Witch Trials. She must choose between her family and the truth. Sounds enthralling? It could be, but it's not! A great theme...wasted. No excitement, monotony, and wordiness wreck the novel. To our minds, the story is like a rubber band, forever stretching, chasing the color away as the story line grows thinner and thinner. While reading Abigail Hobbs's trial, we were falling asleep. Although Rinaldi wastes this one, we recommend other Witch Trial books because most are exciting, edge-of-the-seat thrilling, and not as wordy as some books we know!"
4,A Break with Charity: A Story about the Salem Witch Trials,"I read this book as an independent lit circle book, and I really think that I will read more of this author. Even though this type of book usually doesn't appeal to me, I really thought that the accuracy with history of the Salem Witch Trials tied in really well, while still providing a fictional but moving story about a girl who struggles to speak the truth in a time when it seems like everything is at stake."
3,"OK,but not too good","This book was good compared to other books,but I would reccomend ""Hang a thousand trees with ribbons "" more.I was disappointed in this book, because it sometimes got boring. It's about the Salem Witch Trials, a subject I am usually interested in.Don't read this book unless this is your first time reading a Rinaldi book. If it isn't, I reccomend you read some of her other books."
1,mis-leading personified,the only color i found was a orange moon or sun or whatever for a few seconds. amazon should not sell this crap.
1,pathetic attempt,"Maybe instead of cranking out 4-5 books a year, Mr Patterson should try for one CREDIBLE story. What a ridiculous, sorry excuse for a thriller. Unbelievable plot lines, complete lack of rationale for characters actions. What a waste of money. Try a Nelson Deville novel instead, or read the Kite Runner--now that was a good book!"
2,Shocked. Stunned. Horrified.,"I realize that Patterson is known for his exciting, page-turning reads. I realize that he is famous for the relentless pace of his novels. And, most importantly, I realize that he is famous for stunning twists at the endings of lots of his books.Keeping all that in mind, I have to say that I was shocked and hurt by the, well, absolutely horrifying surprise ending to this book. To say it came at me out of left field would be a massive understatement. It's more like I was standing at home plate in Dodger stadium and was hit by a ball thrown from left field in Yankee Stadium. Truthfully, I never saw it coming. And I was horrified by it. I finished the last pages with my mouth hanging open.And I feel betrayed as well. I realize that twist endings happen often, especially when it comes to Patterson, but I DID NOT LIKE this one. I felt hurt by it.Putting that aside, it was a good read overall, which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one."
4,Tricky Twist,"Although I have noted that many reviews were disappointed in this offering by Patterson and DeJonge, I found the story engaging and well done. However, I listened to it on an audiobook,and that may reflect my overall satisfaction. Unlike most CD books, there was a variety of actors, a different one for each of the many characters. This provided a very interesting listen since I felt the readers characterized their roles with considerable skill. Since the story was told from the variety of viewpoints, one chapter devoted to one voice, it was possible to keep the reader/listener unaware of the villain's identity. The twist at the end took me completely by surprise, but was a satisfactory turn of events for this story. The tricky device of multiple points of view allowed the authors to keep the reader/listener 'in the dark' until the unusual climax arrived. This book doesn't measure up to an Alex Cross novel, but it has merit and is a good crime drama."
3,An ending without salvation,"I am a big James Patterson fan and this book didn't disappoint me until the ending. Patterson's writing is concise and well versed, succinct yet lyrical, ingenious. His books are part of my summer diet and I was happy he wrote a second Beach book. BUT I hated the ending. Surprised or not surprised, I was left feeling empty and a little angry. So, four stars for the first three-quarters of the book, and one star for the ending."
3,Disappointed,"My favorite author, a disappointing reading. His books are usually so action pacted, filled with twists and turns, but this one didn't do it for me."
4,Entertaining.....but just barely,"A bit simplistic....I've always been a Patterson fan, but it seems that the prolific churning out of material is having a negative effect on the end product. It's still a lot of fun to get through a book in less than a day, but much in the same way as watching an episode of CSI or SVU or one of the many franchise cop shows. Character development, plot development are starting to fade away along with overall quality of writing. I still recommend the book and all of Patterson's work, but I yearn for the good old days when I could look forward to a much more engrossing experience."
1,complete waste of time,"Beach Road is mindless and pointless. As for the ""surprise ending,"" Agatha Christie already did that -- and a much better job of it -- with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd 80 years ago. James Patterson, like so many others, appears to more concerned with ""churning them out"" than actually doing the hard work that quality writing requires. Glad I didn't pay for this book!"
2,love patterson - hated book - bad ending,"I love Patterson, read all his work. I am a big fan.this book, has a poor ending, and not believable.disappointing."
5,His best book ever,"I have recommended this book to anyone having never read James Patterson before. I couldn't believe the ending. I was in shock for days. His best to date and I've moved on to several after this one. I couldn't stop saying ""Are you serious... Unbelievable... No he didn't!!!""It was simply masterful.I personally don't understand those 1 star reviews."
2,"Great story, bad last few chapters",I couldn't but this book down. It kept me reading and I was so eager to read the next page. I liked everythin about it until the end.. Come on...Every thing i loved about the book Didn't make sence after i ready the last chapters. I think they tried to hard for a Shocking endng that the messed the whole thing up.
2,Suspenseful but ultimately unrewarding,"I've just finished this book, having started it this morning. As other reviewers have said, it is a holiday read for when you have time for something mindless and gripping. I was entertained by the book and wanted to find out what had happened. Yes, the writing could have been better, but in a book like this I value an interesting storyline over high literature! I did feel invested in the main character, Tom, who is likeable and the best fleshed-out, and also in the plight of Dante, the accused teenager. The twist at the end was startling, but it spoilt the book for me. When I saw it coming I thought that it must be a double bluff, as the resolution of the story unpicks the entire plot and makes the story meaningless. I was disappointed with the way the end of the book played out."
2,Surprise Ending went too far,"Although Patterson seems thrilled he gave us such a surprise ending, for me his surprise went too far and ruined the book.I enjoyed his book until the last 50 pages after which I threw it in the trash.And I am a Patterson fan who always reads and usually enjoys his books. I will think hard before buying his books again."
4,Starts off slow BUT VERY GOOD,Almost stopped reading... first 50 pages slow BUT GLAD I KEPT Going... VERY GOOD
2,Glad I didn't buy the book,"As others have written, the characters are not well-defined (I didn't really care about any of them except the future basketball star), the chapters are painfully short--less than three pages per chapter on average, and I felt cheated by the ending. I am usually a fan of both Patterson and the twist ending. I'm so glad I borrowed the book from a friend rather than paying for a hard cover or even a paperback. I am terribly disappointed in James Patterson."
3,Beach Road,"What a disappointment! I've enjoyed most of Patterson's other novels, but it looks as though he teamed up with the wrong guy this time. Although the novel does give a pretty decent description of that neck of the woods, after reading the story, I sure as heck wouldn't wanna live up there. I'll stay here in North Carolina, thank you very much."
2,Unsatisfying Ending,I have read many of James Patterson's books and have liked most of them except for the extremely short chapters. This one kept me entertained most of the way through but I absolutely hated the ending. I found it completely unbelievable and unsatisfying to the point that I wish I hadn't read it.
4,Interesting writing style,I didn't understand why the writing style was used until the end of the book. Then I realized any other style wouldn't have worked well. I was completely shocked by the ending and had to go back and read a few chapters to see if I could have picked up on it sooner. I recommend that anyone reading the book not scan through it. It's not very long...read it thoroughly.
2,Disappointed,"I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed. This book however, was a big let down. I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing. After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end. The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO sense. WHY?? I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't."
1,Forget Patterson,"How could anyone say anything good about this book.Only because he has made so much money for the book sellers was this book out in print. the charcters are idiots. The plot does not go anywhere, and defies all logic.The ending is to say the least the worst I,ve ever read. I read a lot of his books and put up with his poor writing because he has such good villians.But put me on hold for a long time unless he does better than this."
1,Skip this one,"This was my first -- and last -- James Patterson read. The characters are flat and predictible; the women are especially stereotypical. (Gorgeous, highly sexed, blah blah blah.) The pace zips along, which I suspect is what makes him popular, but the story is poorly plotted and the improbable ""surprise twist"" feels like an afterthought. In the end, the story doesn't hold together. Disappointing on every level."
1,All over the place,"Although I see nothing wrong with trying a different narrative approach, using a first-person perspective that jumps from character to character makes confusion inevitable. Even if you are paying attention, you will, at some point, think a different character is narrating during the numerous chapters.I also thought the ending made the rest of the novel make very little sense. I would also suggest that if an author is writing about lawyers and court cases, that he have a lawyer read through and edit the book. There were several parts that were just silly in regards to the legal aspects of the novel. Maybe I am spoiled by reading John Grisham novels, but an author should do a little research.Overall, the book jumped all over the place, the first-person style led to occasional confusion, and the ending was ridiculous, and made the rest of the story make little sense, without explaining away the inconsistencies. Obviously, I didn't care for it."
1,don't bother,"I have to admit that I didn't finish this book. I needed a couple of books for a long car ride and picked this. Having read Patterson before it seemed like a good choice. If I had read the Amazon reviews prior to purchase, it would have been a more enjoyable trip. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Save your money/time,I am sorry to report this is the last Patterson I will buy. This book tries an unusual technique of telling the story in a series of first person chapters. I find it annoying and disruptive to the narrative. I felt grossly manipulated at the wrap up at the end.
1,BIG disappoinment....terrible ending,This book had potential but the writers blew it!! I felt like throwing the book across the room. There was way too much jumping around from character to character. While I love a surprise ending this one was poorly written and was just a dumb way to end it. The ending didn't figure in well with the rest of the book...it was more like they were tired of writing and just pulled something out of left field and stopped.Don't waste your money buying this book...borrow it if you can find someone that wasn't mad enough to throw it away or check it out from your library if you insist on punishing yourself.
1,Worst ending ever,"The ending is the worst I've ever experienced. Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending for you if you still decided to read this book.The ending is totally implausible for many, many reasons. I mean, it's ridiculous to the point of being a satire of a mystery. I just couldn't believe James Patterson allowed this to be published.The rest of the book is obviously hastily thrown together and definitely not up to Patterson's previous standards.My first thought when I finished ""Beach Road"" was, ""I want my money back."""
1,Garbage,"One-dimensional characters, a ridiculous plot and an ending that made no sense and seemed just slapped on to add a shock to an otherwise dull book. A real stinker. Skip this one."
2,Reader: You've been Punk'd!,"This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense. The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works. Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before. In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene. To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere."
2,OUCH,"I have been a James Patterson fan for years, however this book was a huge disappointment. Soap operas are more convincing and realistic than this book."
3,Perplexed?,"I really liked the book up until then end. I liked reading each person in the books point of view, the way it was broken down from each ones perspective. I was really looking forward to the twist at then end, since there alwasys is one, but i was totally unprepared for what it was. It just made no sense. I sat there re reading the twist when it happend to make sure i was reading it right. It just did not fit at all. I still love James Patterson but this one left me with nothing but ""what the heck???"""
4,Entertaining Read,"I am a James Patterson fan from way back and read Beach Road in one day. I love Patterson's use of short chapters, character dialogs, and fast pace because they make it hard to put one of his books down (even if some of his books are better than others). Although I enjoyed Beach Road, I have read better by Patterson. The plot was engaging, but throwing in Hollywood's A-list of celebrities seemed a little 'hokey'. The ending was a surprise, however it seemed to tie up things too quickly (I was a little fuzzy on Macklin's character). But even with a few glitches, Beach Road is definitely a good and entertaining summer read."
2,Not enough that's new...,I am a big Mandy Moore fan... but I find it difficult to pay 15 dollars for a cd that has most of the same songs I can find on SO REAL. I think this album was a way to make the record company some quick cash. They should have waiting like about 6 months and released a cd with 15 new songs on it!Mark Snyder
1,"Cute, but no cigar","Mandy is a cute girl, but that doesn't make this CD good. Just because she is young doesn't make it OK to have a bad voice. Sorry, but it is true. After listening to this CD, she really needs to stop acting so much like Britney. All the other girl soloists have theie own identity (Brit, Christina, Jessica) but Mandy doesn't. Her songs are way too similar. Britney does it much better than Mandy. So buy Brit's new CD and spare yourself from this 2nd rate trash."
3,Nothing To Squeal About,"The best track on there is probably ""Everything My Heart Desires"". If I'm not mistaken, UK actor/singer Adam Rickitt (who happens to be pretty cute :P) originally did that song. Mandy's version is more sugary and mild. Sometimes she tends to drone on a little due to lack of emotional intensity, which is a pity because some of the songs are catchy. Vocals, for me, are a big thing. But if you want something that will satisfy you temporarily, give this CD a try."
5,WOW!,"I really liked the new Mandy Moore record. It was so mature and sweet at the same time. My favorite song is "" I wanna be with you"" cause there is a guy that i like and Mandy's song totally expressed my feelings toward him. That song has so much emotion and heart put into it! So does her mew album! Way to go Mandy!"
3,Its ok,"This album is pretty good. The best song is definetly ""I wanna be with you"" and the next best song is the remix of that song. Most of the other cuts are from her old album, and they are good, but they aren't new. My advice; if you have her first album and aren't crazy about ""I wanna be with you"", save your money."
1,Don't buy it! It's a WASTE of money!,"My friend WAS a Mandy Moore fan but ever since she went to buy this cd, we were both disgusted on how bad this cd is. The remixes are horrible and the songs are poorly written. Her voice is terrible and often nasally. This cd is over hyped and whoever wants a bad cd get this one but if you want a better cd, i suggest you search on for it. this cd was put out so quickly so people would not forget her but to put out already existing songs on her last cd on this one is ridiculous and her voice sounds really bad. DON'T BUY THIS CD< ITS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,YUCK!,"This CD was given to me for my birthday. It's awful. Who told this girl she could sing? I'm only 15, but I can recognized talented singers, and she's not one! Don't waste your time or money on this CD. There's nothing appealing about it."
2,Not worth the money...,"The only song worth owning off of this cd that is not on Mandy Moore's mediocre debut album is the title track, which is a great song. However, besides ""Walk Me Home"", no track on this album is worth listening to at all. The remixes aren't all that good, the new tracks are week, and all in all this album is a wasted purchase. The best part of the album is the videos, which are nice. Other than that, buy her debut album, download the mp3 for ""I Wanna Be With You"", and get her good third album..."
5,This is what Britney wishes she was.,"There's a lot of blonde hair working out there: Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy. Does Mandy Moore have the best voice? No. Does she have the best songs? Not really. Why should you buy this disc? Because she manages to do what Britney can't: take pure bubblegum designed for the pre-teen crowd and make it INTERESTING.Yes, this CD doesn't have a lot of new material. It's mostly remixes with some new tracks (which are sublime). Nevertheless, in terms of quality it far surpasses Spears' mediocre sophomore set. While it's hard to picture Spears maturing behind her material, it's easy to do so with Moore. Her breathy vocals and lyrical interpretation belie her young age, and makes this disc a must for those who do or don't have _So Real_ in their collection."
1,RIPPED OFF by Sony Music,"anyone thinking that they are getting the full remixes of 'candy (wade roberson remix)' and 'i wanna be with you (soul solution remix)' will surely be disappointed with the 3:00 and 4:00 edited versions. c'mon 550music, epic and sony... how can you be more misleading to your buyers? if you're going to put the EDITED remixes on the album you should say ""EDIT""."
1,Uggggh!,"I really disliked this. They are trying to show off Mandy's talent in all the ballads, but she actually has none. The ballads are boring and sappy. Everything else is a little better, but too sugar-coated and corny. Mandy is not half as good as her peers."
4,I wanna be with you~mandy moore,"Sounded good, but not awsome. She has a really pretty voice and will continue to mature and become better as she grows"
4,Nicely done,Heres how I put it 1 I wanna be with you: My second fave on the album! Sweet and lovely! eveything my hart desires: Great song catchy lyrics.It's kinda like ricky martin (It's got a latin beet)! 3 Want you back: Preety good! It is a great song to sing along with. 4 The way to my hart. This is my third fave on the album! Great song! 5 So real (remix): I dont like this much. 6 Lock me in your hart: Great song! sounds like Chritina agularia's genie in a bottle. 7 walk me home:great slow song. 8 I like it: This has a disco sound/beet to it. It's preety good.9 So real: this is my fave on the album. great song!10 candy (remix) It's ok! The normal one is much better! 11 your face:It's slow. It's ok. 12 I wanna be with you (soul remix): It's ok!
1,Possibly the worst movie ever produced,This film is terrible beyond description. Avoid at all costs.
1,WORST FILM EVER,"Jesus, it kills me to give it a star, but unfortunately there isn't a no star option. Worst film I've ever seen."
1,VERY AWFUL,THE ONLY WAY THIS MOVIE WILL BE FUNNY IF IT WAS PUT ON MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000.THAT S ONLY WAY IT WILL MAKE SOMEONE LAUGH.
1,"Pathetic, vulgar, confusing movie",.... We watched it as a group and were shocked by the vulgarity for the sake of it.. Oveall a disaster.
1,THE Worst film ever...,"I know I've given it one star, but only because I could not give it a negative 10..... It's just the ""F"" word strung together over and over for three plus hours. In fact, if you took out all the times the ""F"" word was spoken, then you'd have a twenty minute movie....I ran out to see this picture immediately upon its release because I was so impressed with Anderson's Boogie Nights. Now, I use Magnolia as my rating for the worst film ever made....After an hour into the film, I wanted to leave but was certain that it had to get better. After two hours, I felt I had vested too much time in it to leave. At over 3 hours I had to stay until the painstaking end and then I literally, screamed out, ""I want those three hours of my life back!""Just absolutely horrible!"
2,Love it or hate it = rent it before you buy it,You will either love it or hate it. I think it is a Robert Altman wanna be film that ultimately fails to tie everything together. Please rent before you buy and you decide.
2,"Remember ""Short Cuts""?","I think I already saw this film in the early 90's. It was called ""Short Cuts"". Altman directed it. I guess no one remembers because you never hear anyone coming out and stating the obvious... ""Magnolia"" is a stone rip-off. How clever can it be? It's got the same style w/ the interesecting storylines, LA county setting, and ""riveting"" ending. They even swiped one of the lead actresses! Give me a break. See ""Short Cuts"" instead."
1,zero stars please,"holy cow, did this movie stink! poorly adjusted people swearing, complaining, doing drugs, spacing out, whining about their feelings and misery for more than three whole hours. oh joy! then there were the overly-long dreary songs and the cast sing-along in the middle of the film to boot. and of course don't forget about the ""surprise"" ending.this film tops my ""stupidest films of the 90's"" list, with *the green mile* a close second.someone please get pta some prozac before he writes his next film. because this film was complete trash."
2,One of the few if only movie I ever walked out of in the theatre,"The movie was a bit too confusing and lame for me to enjoy. Yes, I can see how some people like it. It seems like people either love this movie or hate it. It's sort of like Mulan Rouge - a kaleidescope of confusion.For me, I like something that is a bit more grounded. It's definitely original, but expression without a thought or care of what the audience might like is like throwing darts. You can hit your target or miss the mark."
2,Mildly entertaining.,"I was fascinated at first with how intriguing Magnolia seemed to pretend to be. As the story went on, you could readily see that the highly mysterious beginning had absolutely nothing to do with the actual film. Nor are the individual characters in the movie intermingled at all, as the film purports they are. There isn't any cohesiveness. Great performances by he actors...all did a charming job...but the stories were mostly boring and had almost no depth at all. And way too much music. Half the movie was a music video for Aimee Mann's great songs."
5,"""and this was all just one big coincidence""","This movie is great. PT Anderson is a great director. and what great ideas. This movie shows a little bit of everyone in it. when i first watched it i felt as though there was a little part of me in every charcter of the film and that's what got me so emotially attached to it and why i loved it so much.this moive seems to be very long which it is i think its about 2 hours and 30 minuates(where in somewhat of the parts it drag)the movie is all mixed up, it goes form charcter to charcter and they all tie into together it was kind of like watching the dramatized version of pulp fiction.i was really impressed with Cruise's part in the film. he did a really great job of acting like the egotistic male then being complealty sensitive on the inside."
1,Terrible,"Stay away from this movie. The whole movie was pointless and boring. Reading some of these reviews you might get the idea that the movie has a deep plot. It doesn't, it is about as deep as a van damne movie. Ohhh and the ending is terrible. Please don't waste three hours of your life."
5,Utterly engrossing and wonderfully made,"The Bottom Line:A great film that introduces and develops a half-dozen connected storylines in a thoroughly unique manner before introducing a plot element that has polarized viewers but completely fits in the context of the film, Magnolia is a modern masterpiece by PT Anderson which will stay with you long after much tamer and shorter (it is long, though very fast-moving) films are gone; don't be put off by the nay-sayers--see this stunning film.4/4"
3,"Messy, but meaningful","Magnolia is a strange movie. We learn about all sorts of different characters, who all have all sorts of problems. The beginning was wayyyy confusing, because everything went so fast! But things slowed down. Another disadvantage, all throughout the movie, we keep flashing by every scene as they're left off the last time we saw them. Chaos. But not everything is bad. There are good performances by Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore. The acting is great by everyone. There are some funny moments.Most of this film is depressing. NOTE: There is no MAGNOLIA!!! (Why'd they call it that?!). The surprise climax is quite breathtaking (and somewhat humorous). I recommend this DVD if you rented it and you liked it, but not for any other reason, besides the extra features on the bonus disc."
1,I want my money back and...,"After renting this movie, I felt the need to return to the video store and not only demand my money back but my hourly rate for the three hours I wasted as well.This movie, sporting an excellent cast, had great potential. The first ten minutes of the movie made me feel I was truly in for a great movie. The next hour and a half kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for how the plots were going to come together.While watching the last hour of this movie, it became obvious that they never would. The dialog became slow and the characters lost their interest and the common theme that brings the movie together in the end is...I so wish I could tell you how this movie ends just so you WON""T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON IT! All I can say is...when it rains, it pours!"
1,Boring,"All I can say is that this movie really was trite and very boring. It was tring really hard to be something that it wasn't. It felt like someone was despertly tring to tell me, ""look I can be creative."" There wasn't anything ground breaking. Way overhyped."
3,PT Anderson is good but...,"Well, this is a very well directed movie, but that does not cover up for the weak story. The plot is a jumbled mess that flies all over the place, and never comes together the way you were expecting. The ending as well, is very dissapointing. Whats good, about it? The acting, is top notch, by far. Everybody (a very impressive cast) shines as an actor, and inspite of disliking this movie, I will see anything that PT Anderson does in the future. He's young and filled with promise, and I am sure in the future he will outdo this movie."
1,Huh?,"Let me just say this movie was completely engaging, interesting and thought provoking, right up until it started raining frogs. Huh? I love how writers sometimes throw something into a story which is completely absurd and irrelevent and then try to pass it off as some kind of artsy smartsy thing. I thought and thought for some connection or metaphor that the frogs could represent. Did I miss something? What so brilliant about raining frogs? I could think of that. All in all, some nice performances, interesting stories and characters which no doubt some people could relate to, but it all crashed and burned with that ending."
1,One of the worst movies I've seen.,"In my history of being an avid filmgoer, no film maker has been more offensive, pretentious, and without a point than P.T. Anderson. The intro to this film was so worthless, but sadly, seemed the film's greatest attempt at being clever - and it goes downhill from there. Lack of editing seems evident throughout all of his films, but this one offends like no other. The idea of great actors + no script = art house success is a crime to the idea of cinema. This summer held too much evidence that the end of cinema is near, this movie is the swan song of the decline. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. Well, maybe... Depends on how much I disliked them. Avoid like herpes. But then again, my favorite directors are S.Kubrick and W.Allen - and I didn't get the joke in Boogie Nights. Or was the boredom and depression I suffered intentional?"
5,Magnolia,"The characters of this poingant film are each caught in their own tradgedy, trapped and struggling to find meaning, to find resolution, even to find life, and yet in the chaos of thier lives is an honesty, and an inexplicaple beauty. From Meaninglessness and coincidence become themselves a meaning. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a masterpiece. He uses fresh tecniques to tell a complex set of stories about sorrow, cancer and corruption, that instead of being depressing, is a life-affirming expirience. The stories are dark, yes, but not without hope, and not without humor. Many of actors adeptly portray fascinating characters, Tom Cruise in particular is a suprise with a fresh new style. I can honestly say, without reservation, that this is the best movie I have ever seen. Watch Magnolia. Its an expirience."
3,Worth seeing but not all that compelling,"Anderson is obviously a very talented director and the performances in this film are all quite good but the interweaving stories never really moved me at all, despite the fact they they were obviously supposed to. The opening sequence is very original and brilliant, though, and it's beautifully shot all the way through. I'd defintitely recommend seeing it but I'd be surpirsed to find anyone truly blown away by it."
2,Huh?,"Well, I'm not a film aficionado. Nor am I an artiste. So . . . in the opinion of a philistine, this flick is a bit weird, rather confusing and often boring. And too long. On the positivie side, there is some good character creation: I particularly liked the work of Robards, Macy and Cruise. There IS some really nice camera work. And there are a few riveting scenes. But there are also scenes that played like nails on the blackboard -- particularly the scenes between the cop and the drug addict. Fortunately, I saw this at the dollar movie house so I didn't lose much money on it."
1,Proof that nice packaging can trick us into renting bad DVDs,"The beautiful packaging of this movie and the ensemble of actors looked promising, but something gets lost in the translation. Perhaps it's the director's insistence to make this 3 hours long when 2 hours would suffice, perhaps it's the in-your-face moral messages, or perhaps it's the constant use of the f-word and other phrases meant to shock, such as the one the is repeated about respecting certain things that are really more functional than they are worthy of respect, but somehow this film fails to deliver. The raining of amphibians must have been added at the end when the director realized he had to give the audience some sort of an ending. Three hours of watching messed up people deal with the consequences they can no longer avoid is not much of a movie and this isn't art -- it's just nonsense and weirdness masking as art.However, if you wanted to illustrate overacting, this film would be a great reference tool."
5,The best travel book around!,DK guides are by far the best for any trip -- their black-by-block walking guides just can't be beat.
2,its not worth it./....,"i read this book for an english project, thinking it would be exciting....yet it is interesting, it is also very confusing..the characters confused me, as did the journal exerpts...unless you are forced to read this book, or have a lot of time on your hand, then i suggest that you go and find another book...."
1,too complicated,"I love war strategy games and played clash of steel, panzer general series, etc. countless times, but AOW is just too complicated for me. The interface is busy and there are hundreds of tiny icons. You just can't tell how good or what a unit is without clicking on it. I tried to learn the game twice over a year and couldn't even do the tutorial. I'm sure its good if you can figure out how to play."
3,Eye-lock electronic door lock room guard,"it's good for girls who have brothers or sisters that are always going in their room, this will keep their room lock and keep their brothers and sisters out."
1,Annoying Toy!!!,"I hated this toy. For the past few nights, the alarm on it has been going off for no reason at all. When I first got it, it worked perfectly, but after a while, when your trying to enter your password, it records things when you don't even blink! I thought it was cool, but now it just wakes me up in the middle of the night!"
2,THIS TOY IS A RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I went ahead and bought this stupid toy for myself.At first it worked perfectly,but then it said the code was wrong,so I had to take it off to get into my bedroom sometimes.And at night,it would fall right off the door and the alarm would go off!!!!!!!!!I couldn't fall asleep for hours!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!"
5,It really works!,"The eye-lock room gaurd is the best toy! When I was at a sleep over, my brothers tried 1,000 times to get in but they could'nt!No one could get in exept me."
1,don't buy it!!!!!!!,"don't waste your money on buying this toy!!!!! i recieved 1 for my b-day and it worked for about two weeks and i would try and blink in the password and it wouldnt accept it! then it started falling off because the tape wouldnt stick!!! even if it was on my door and staying on, you sould be 15ft away from it and the alarm would go off!!! then one time i needed into my room for an emergency, and it wouldn't accept the password, i ended up ripping it off my door to get in!!!! just trust me, this toy doesn't work. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Review of Eye Lock Room Guard,I purchased the Eye Lock Room Guard for my daughter. She loves it and thinks it's a great way to keep her brother out of her room!
1,a bad room guard,the room guard isnt worth money!i mean who will come into your room!if you want to keep your brother or sister out of your things get the Room Gear Lockable Snoop Proof Safe For Girls!Eventualy your brothers or sisters will find out the color blink code for the eye lock room guard! Please if your child wants this so called toys rethink gettig them it and explain to the it isnt going to work! The Room Gear Lockable Snoop Proof Safe For Girls works perfectly for me!
2,No me gusto,"La fragancia no dura nada decepcionado después de usar productos clinique de hombre, solo me dura 20 minutos ahora uso el perfume de ambientador no lo recomiendo uso varios de este tipo y duran todo el dia menos este, dinero perdido"
4,Nice gift!,I ordered this men's cologne as a gift for my son. He loves it! And I enjoy making him HAPPY! Pun intended.
3,Good Product.,"I have a really good sense of smell and usually it takes me longer to get used to a scent to where I'm no longer smelling it on my body. I cant smell this cologne from the first spray, however, others say they can. I give it three stars because others smelling it is what matters but me smelling it is just weird. So just be wary go somewhere and smell it before you buy it see what you think and see what others think."
4,The best single GED book I have found,"While this book is not as good as it could be, I have used it through a couple of editions preparing students for the GED and prefer it to several others I have tried. My favorite thing about it is that it highlights (in grey boxes) important things to remember, and chooses them well. It's awfully big to carry around, but it's a lot cheaper than trying to use many different books for each GED subject. I have my students purchase this one, and use it primarily, but then loan them other more specific books when they need more details, or more practice in a particular area. I try to get them to keep and use this book for a reference when needed, and it is pretty good for that. The science area is my least favorite (but maybe that's because it's my own weakest area)."
3,Strictly,If you are looking for a few laughs and a romantic story then Strictly Business is the movie for you. The movie was not only funny but it touched on a few life lessons.
2,light-hearted,this film has something catchy about it.it's pretty average but the story holds my attention everytime i see it.from the business world to the party scene very interesting.
1,NOT THE BEST WORK FROM TOMMY DAVIDSON,IT'S STRAIGHT AND ALL HALLE BERRY LOOKS FINE AND YOUNG.TOMMY DAVIDSON ACTS LIKE HE'S READING THE SCRIPT RIGHT THERE ON THE SET.THE MOVIE AIN'T WORTH GETTING TRUST ME.ONE LOVE.
3,Long shipping,"It took two weeks to get this product. I was in okay condition, with a big bend on the front cover. I just wish I got it faster. I purchased from this seller because of the great reviews on fast shipping but my shipping wasn't as fast as I had hoped for."
3,It is OK,"My wife likes it so it is OK. I thought it is very small . The photo fooled me , I guess that was the point. I would call it BB's on thread and would be telling the truth!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Love these socks,"This is the 2nd time I've ordered these. They're cushy, they stay in place (don't slip down your heel) I love them!"
4,Making it work for you is the Challenge....,"When I realized that I Binged daily, I finally saw that I had a problem with food. My counselor turned me on to Feeding the Hungry Heart, which made me try her Workshop (MP3 format from her direct site). I was finally on the right path, but don't let the easy rules fool you. Learning how to eat again is hard work, with daily challenges, and relapses. I would never have beleived how many others face the challenges I fac everyday. To anyone struggling with Bingeing; I wish you luck, and happy eating, it truly is a lifestyle change."
4,"refreshing, freeing",How basic. What has hatred ever healed? How many fat people believe that if they just felt bad enough about themselves they would find the motivatoin to loose weight. If this worked... we would all be skinny. I am delighted to reccomend this encouraging book.
2,Opinion of Breaking Free.....,I sat down very motivated to learn from this book as it's titlehas been my lifelong problem. I found the book very hard to getinto and have not gone back to it.
3,"Fun toy, the Mice on the corners fall off easily",Fun toy but for what I paid for it I expected the mice on the roof corners to be sewed on instead of glued. They came off pretty quickly.
2,Too hard to change the battery,"I bought this product in March 2009. It was accurate and stayed put on my clothes. The problem came when the battery ran out in October 2009. The instructions for opening the case don't work. After much effort, I succeeded in getting the case open... and simultaneously broke the clip off."
3,An unbelievable story of a woman evangelist (1880-1924).,"Maria B. Woodworth-Etter defied the imagination for women of the latter part of the 19th century and the first 24 years of this century. This book is her own account of preaching long before she could vote, packing out an 8,000-seat tent, resisting opposition from Mass. to Californian. She received opposition not only from the admitted ungodly but also from other Christian groups. When they told her women were to keep silent in the church and learn from their husbands at home, she gave a classic example: ""If some women learned from their husbands, they would die in ignorance."" The book is well over 500 pages and covers her meetings and quotes newspapers of the day. A companion book is my biography, ""The Woman Evangelist."" Although I document many of her claims in ""Signs and Wonders,"" I am objective and do not overlook her weaknesses in theology and practices. However, I think you'll consider it a fair treatment. Wayne Warne"
5,Gloria Vanderbilt Amanda Stretch Denim Jeans BLACK 10 Misses,Good fit; washes well without shrinkage; would recommend.
3,Item info didn't say 'stretch',"The jeans are ok, but I was disappointed that when they arrived they said 'stretch' jeans...I purchased the jeans as a Christmas gift for my mother and she does not like, and will not wear stretch jeans. Would have been beneficial to have that info in the description."
1,Who is a Jew?,"What's the point of this movie? That you are a Jew if your mother was born into the Tribe even if you reject everything that Judaism stands for? Isn't there some level of moral and ethical behavior that is required even if it is not the extreme world of Chassidism. Don't Jews have to belong to a Jewish community and celebrate at least some of the basic rituals? I won't spoil the end of this film for potential viewers, but to me it was highly unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, ""Mendy"" does raise the very timely question of ""Who is a Jew?"" For me, it is not Mendy."
4,Out of nowhere,"I had heard about this album and had no clue what was in store. It's an album that is made for headphones, stereo speakers, anywhere you can sit and zone out and soak up the music. BMSR sucked me in with this one, and I've been buying up all their albums ever since. Quite a while from now, this might be regarded as a classic. I already do."
2,"Nice cabinet, poor cooler","My order arrived to my home slightly damaged. Although the seller discounted the item because of this scratch, the actual cooler barely keeps the wine cool. I will probably have to purchase another cooler to replace the one that was with the cabinet. All in all, for that much money, I am very very disappointed in the product."
4,as good as I remembered it,"I have not seen this since 1964, when my dad and I went to it. I loved it so much that I had a comic book of it that I read and re-read. Limpet is a kind of hero Walter Mitty, magically transformed into a fish and devoted to the US Navy in WWII. The animation is strong, it is full of good characters who are funny in their awareness of the unbelievability of it all, and there are some surprisingly adult themes, like the fact that Limpet's wife may be having a love affair.This time, I watched it with my son, who has a kind of indulgent tolerance of all the ""strange stuff"" I like to add to our DVD library. Yes, he enjoyed it as much as I did, another thing to share across generations. It is a wonderful film and Don Knotts adds his quirky talent to an original.Warmly recommended."
5,My opinion for amazon,"I received this movie, and it was in very good condition. It looked almost new I watched the movie and it was very good quality picture. I buy A lot from Amazon. i bought hachi, the Stallion, And will buy more from Amazon."
4,"Service great, price not great","The delivery service was good and the dvd was new as promised, so I rate this a 4. However, I paid $8.49 and then found it at Walmart for $4.00, so I am not rating is a 5."
1,None the wiser re Inquiry,"If you are seeking understanding, knowledge or a functional exposition on the processes of Inquiry, don't bother with this book. It doesn't convey anything apart from vague generalities. 480 pages of pointless waffle."
5,Awesome Devotional,"This is probably the best devotional I've read, especially when going through a rough time. I've recommended this book to friends and they love it as well."
4,Circle William,"Without a lot of convoluted subplots ""Circle William"" delved into the workings of both an Arleigh Burke Class destroyer and the behinds the scenes working our government. I liked the Schmidt brothers, I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of profanity. Even though this book was written several years ago, it was incredibly relivent to current events.What initially drew me to the book was that it was written about the USS Winston Churchill (DDG81). My son is currently assigned to the USS Roosevelt (DDG80), he thought the book was good and did a good job dipicting life on board ship.It's an easy read, gripping in spots, especially toward the end. I will never forget that ""Schmidt happens!"""
3,"Good , but wasn't enough fast-paced for me","Just finished this book.... I really liked the psychological aspects Poirot addressed, but I think the story would have been better if you could have seen more of what the expedition was like before the murder. I like how Christie's books always supprise you at the end when she reveals the murderer(usually the last person you guess!) My favorite books by her are ""N or M"" and ""They Came to Bahgdad"" Read them!"
3,It needed a different reader,"The story is great. I love Agatha Christie and Hercule and have many of the audiobooks on CDs and cassettes, but I was disappointed with the reader on this one. She did not have the range of voices that were needed and just was not good at the accents. Poirot was terrible. I hope they don't let her read too many Agatha Christies. I will think twice about getting an audiobook that Ms. Massey reads."
2,Too Dark,"This version just did not capture me. I love most all versions of A Christmas Carol, but I felt this one was a little too dark and broading."
2,Nope!,"I think Patrick Stewart is a terrific actor however, I didn't care for him in the roll of Ebenezer Scrooge. A real disappointment. Donated it to the local public library."
5,Christmas,One of these items was a Christmas gift. The recipient was very happy to receive same and is a big fan of this holiday movie. I also enjoyed this version.
2,An Okay Movie,"Because I'm a huge fan of Vivien Leigh, I bought this movie a while ago to add to my collection. It was somewhat slow. Three times I watched it and ended up falling asleep. I think I'll just read the book instead."
4,Captures the beautiful simplicity of the play,"The utter effulgence of Brando's portrayal of the brash, uncouth Stanley was somehow overlooked by the critics. His natural charisma and sexual magnetism is overwhelming. Other than this oversight, the film was richly rewarded with many well deserved Oscars including Best Picture and a Best Actress award for Vivian Leigh's wrenching and pleasingly theatric submission as Blanche. The primative environs of New Orleans set the foreboding mood of the story well."
3,Histrionic,"Histrionic and overdramatic by today's standards, with a lot of crying, screaming and exaggerated dialogue. Nonetheless, an interesting story and social commentary whose message has held up well over time."
5,A Classic,"This is a marvelous update and restored ""Streetcar"" and I loved it....especially the booklet that accompanied the Blu-Ray versionI love Tennessee!."
4,Air Filter for Briggs & Strat,Good after market air filter. Fits the same as the OEM type and same quality.
1,ugh....,when I ordered this I expected it to be nice and sweet.While instead it smelled trashy and sour.I would not even send this to my worst enemy.the only good thing about this was that it arrived 6 days early.
5,"OMG, I can't believe you people","Any TRUE die-hard Nirvana/Kurt Cobain fan would treat this CD (And all other Interview CDs) like their own child...I mean, this is an interview of the one and only Kurt Cobain. I would LOVE to hear this guy. I'm buying this CD as soon as I get the money, and I CAN'T wait! Any true fans out there...get this CD =D"
5,Best Norwegian Band Ever!,For All Tid is another album I can't understand because it's in Norwegian but I still like it! I first came across Dimmu Borgir in about '07 or '08 on this music show Hard Times I didn't know who they were but I know I liked the front man. In 2008 I saw them in the Hit Parader magazine and for some reason I thought Death Cult Armageddon was a really cool name so in January 2009 I got Death Cult Armageddon for my 19th birthday it was my first album of them and now I have all nine of their albums and four dvds. I haven't see them live in person yet and I can't wait to see them.
2,My Least Favorite Dimmu Album,This is a very strange album. It's lo-fi in its production and the vocals are well quite bad. The worst thing about the album however is just how disjointed it feels. Some of the tracks are just outright pointless. There are some good tracks on here though such as Hunnerkongens and Raabjorn. Overall though this album is recommended for diehard Dimmu fans only.
4,Better than the TWILIGHTS !!!,"Extreme scenes open this wild ride of a film,Shows the audience a character...Well who was BORN BAD.Michael Welch has a JAMES DEAN screen prescence, He controls his emotions and brings you into his reality.Great cast and plot that just flows with a ` Roller Coaster' of emotions drawing you into the jeopardy and sheer terror.Wanted to hate ( And probably was made to by plot) these bad guys from the start and feel for the family that they invade.Great cover (poster art) and to think Welch comes from the TWILIGHT movies,Huh,May have to watch one now to see in another role."
3,Pretty Good - fills a need,"This is the apparently the only drainboard made any more that drains out the short end -- all the Rubbermaid and other ones I looked at drain on the long end, which doesn't fit our counter. I was glad to find this one, though being hard plastic instead of soft, it does tend to shift around a lot on the counter. Wish someone would make a nice high quality drainboard that drains on the short end. In the meantime this one at least does the job."
3,satisfaction review,"The drainboard was just as presented. We found it a little too lightweight compared to the one we were using before. For this reason it moved around too much and the drained water collected on the counter, not in the sink. In addition, the price of shipping was more than the item itself. But that was the offer and we knew it."
2,Flimsy and not very sloped.,"I really wanted this to work. I could have bought a different kind at Target for less but I thought this one would be better. I really need one that drains from the short side, like other reviewers. Why is it so hard to find boards that do that? This one though, is not worth the money. It looks nice, which is why I gave it 2 stars. But it is SO flimsy, and the slope is not steep. Once I put my dish drainer on it, the board bows in the middle and the water pools up. I actually had to set this new board on top of my old and stained but firm and sloped board that I've had forever. Such a bummer really. Looks like I'll have to get the one from my physical Target store after all."
5,its a wall plate,"Very sturdy, works prefect, I would recomend, not sure why I have to use a minimum number of words though"
3,Only clean wall plate in 3-Gang I could Find,There aren't many 3-Gang+ wall plates with a clean - hidden screw connection. I didnt find any at my local home depot or Lowe's stores. The unit is made up of two pieces. One piece is mounted to the switch or receptacle using two small screws for each screw. The fitting is tight and there is no wrong way (top or bottom) to connect the piece. The second part is the cover that snaps over the unit that is screwed onto the switch. Its quite difficult to separate the two units and several times I found myself using a flat head screwdriver to detach the two pieces. This should be easily re-engineered by the folks at Lutron as there are other brands that easily detach themselves. The overall look is very nice but the only reason I purchased this particular unit was due to the lack of competition in this 3-gang market. There is no reason why a piece of plastic without tight tolerance requirements should cost this much.
2,When it works it is great,I could do two pages on the ordeal I have been through with TWO different WGT634U s.I will however give a synopsis.BUGGY - not sure if it is firmware or hardware but this router needs constant rebooting.HOT - Quite possibly one reason for the buggy nature. I have a fan on mine though and it still has problems.FRUSTRATING TECH SUPPORT - outsourced to India.Only reason this POS is getting a 2 is how fast it is when it does work.
3,"When it works, it's fine, but this is a buggy product.","My initial review for this product was a good one. When it works, it's a nice router, and the USB feature is useful. Two problems though prevent this from being a smart buy or a reliable product.1. There is a bug in the configuration that prevents you from automatically seeing the Mac addresses of attached wireless devices. This makes it difficult to add them to your Mac filter if you use one. You have to manually type in the addresses. A Pain.2. After 3 months of using this product, and suffering random repeated loss of Internet requiring reboots, we finally traced it to this router. The drops, both wired and wireless, only happen with this router in the picture. Didn't happen with my old WGR614. This is apparently a widespread problem that Netgear has yet to admit to or resolve. Perhaps a class action will jar them into reality as this is obviously a faulty product. Faulty in design"
5,The most diverse Dylan live album available.,"What Sony Japan has published here is simply the most varied live album that any fan of Bob Dylan might be able to purchase. The selection spans his whole career, from humble folk beginnings to Elder Statesman of conscious, intelligent, creative fusion music. Surprisingly enough, two of the most exciting and freshest items, the opening gospel song 'Glory' and 'Times have changed', are among his most recent songs. An excellent compilation, featuring all the different shades and perspectives that a long-time Dylan fan might hope for when buying a newly issued live album from Bob Dylan."
4,"Worth It For ""Born In Time""","I have many official Bob Dylan CD's but I have never got into the bootlegs with Bob because it just is too much and too expensive for me to keep up with. That made this a good purchase for me because it had many songs from a broad time frame. I think all the songs on here are at least good and some are great.I might be a neophyte here but I really think the live version of ""Born In Time"" is outstanding and is worth the price of this CD by itself. That version just shows what a great performer Bob Dylan is. I only wish the CD was a bit cheaper.Finally I hope one day Dylan releases many more of his complete live concerts like the Dead or Pearl Jam have, particularly after reading Paul Williams 3rd Dylan book because it sounds like Dylan was doing much of his creating on stage in the 70's & 80's as opposed to in the studio. Ill keep my fingers crossed and make sure I tune in to XM radio on Wednesdays at 10 AM EST."
2,NOT Widescreen,"According to IMDB, at least two of these should be widescreen. They're not, in this release."
1,Crass presentation,"At the lower right corner of the screen there appears continuously throughout each movie the text, 'Ed Wood Collection'. These classic movies are in many ways short on craftsmanship, but that does not give the distributor license to deface them with crass self promotion."
4,Triangulation,"As Suze Simon begins her junior year, she finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. On one side is Paul Slater, a ""hottie"" who seems to really like her and understands about her unusual abilities, since he is also gifted in that way. Unfortunately, he's a creep. On the other side is Jesse, a charming, courteous, debonair guy who is every girl's dream. The only drawback is, he's dead.There are some truly laugh out loud scenes, yet a poignancy to the novel also exists. This is a book for any one of any age who likes a good romance."
5,this was such a good book,i read this book in 2 day! after school i would read until my eyes hurt. i loved this book and would tell and one and age to read this. the ending is a little disapointing but ovewr all i give this book 5 stars *****
4,a good book,"I recently bought this book after reading the other books in the Mediator series, this time, it is a harcover book. If anyone remembers the last book and what happened between Suze and Paul Slater, well, Paul is back, he now attends the same school as Suze and he wants to teach her more about being a mediator. Suze is still in love with Jesse and she still thinks he doesn't feel the same way. All in all, a good book."
3,nice fragrance,"Bought this today for my oldest daughter's b-day in March she will be 21 yrs old. She loves Clinique Happy & rarely buys it for herself since its pretty spendy, I found this at Marshalls here in Oregon, as part of a gift set with a 1.0 oz spray along with a body lotion for $22.99, it's not quite so powdery/fruity as the original Happy. I like it better we will see if she agrees, Clinique produces Happy Heart, original Happy, & this version Happy to Be. It's not my favorite perfume, but my daughter really likes Clinique perfume,if you like a lighter, younger scent, I think you will like it. Update 02/12/07 well she didn't wait for her b-day but the good news she loves it even better than the original Happy, she says it has a more perfume smell & is a more mature scent than Happy, whatever that means, hope that helps anyone choosing this perfume."
1,Never receive the perfume !! Or appologies for making we wait for almost a month!!!,"I waited for almost a month for the item , but never received it nor did I receive information on what happened to the item. No appologies. Instead of crediting back to my credit card account, Amazon gave me a store credit which is unfair as I prefer the money back and it was not my fault the item never got sent to me ."
5,A Gem,"Very entertaining and informative, this little book was a pleasure to read. Written by Irish folks, it offers witty commentary on the social and cultural traditions of Ireland as well as discussing the wholesome and delicious cuisine. If you've got any interest in Ireland at all, you're sure to enjoy this wonderful guide."
1,Completely misleading,"First of all, let me tell you that there is a reason none of the songs have the lead vocals on Rhian Benson's website - she is NOT a soul singer. She's not even a crooner. She sounds like a 40-year old lounge singer tryiong to keep up with thowaway tracks from every ""neo-soul"" artist's album from the past five years. The lyrics are mind-numbing, the vocals are laughable and the melodies themselves would be the only saving grace, if only they didn't sound like essentially the same song...over and over and over and over and over again.Skip this."
4,This Is My Chance To Say How I Feel,"I first got a sample of Rhian Benson from a promo cd (think I got it at some club). Never heard of her before but was skeptical that it was just another singer trying to make a club hit. And when I listened to the promo I decided that the cd was a must have. Rhian Benson blends jazz elements with the contemporary R&B sound. The instrumentation is extremely enjoyable and relaxing. Rhian doesn't have the greatest voice but she can still sing. With a voice deeper than most singers folks may be turned off but that will be them missing out not me playa. While a few of the tracks are too experimental when she hits the spot she hits the spot...if you know what I mean. Sing To The Child, Words Hurt Too, and Say How I Feel are classic tracks with funky harmonies. The only problem with this cd is that towards the end it gets kinda slow & syrupy. They should have tried to mix up the tracklisting. Other than that minor detail this album is well worth having. 4 stars."
5,"Authentic! Jazzy, She writes and composes..Impressive Debut!","I first heard this CD while listening to WCLK online out of Atlanta, Tavis Smiley intervied her and played samples of most of the songs. Not only did she appear very humble to be soo beautiful as I now see, but she was intelligent, heartfelt and compassionate. She discussed her life in her hometown of Ghana and her migration to Los Angeles, both being ""Gold Coast's"". Her music is authentic and her Song ""Sing to A Child"" almost brought tears to my eyes, she said that the children in Ghana inspired it. She's true to herself and her music and lyrics are reflections of that. I also like ""Say How I Feel"" and ""Spirit"". Her voice is different and hte music is really nice. This is a star rising...one to buy!"
3,A talented songwriter but only an above-average vocalist,"Great tracks - several haunting and beautiful melodies are present on this CD. Unfortunately, however, Rhian's vocal talents simply aren't impressive enough for my tastes; she doesn't exhibit much range on this disc. While she sounds somehat like Sade, ostensibly, Sade's vocal talent far surpasses Rhian's. Perhaps the chanteuse will prove me wrong on her next album by stretching herself more vocally."
5,RHIAN AT HER BEST,I am surprise Rhian Benson never had more commercial success. This is a great CD and the song arrangements are excellent. VEry nice night music or when your driving alone in your car
3,Good book,"I would reccommend this book to anyone who knows nothing about the art of rapport. I knew a fair amount about this and this book taught me very little new. I would highly reccomend ""Unlimited Power"" by Tony Robbins. Much more value for money and the one chapter in that book covers most of this one!!"
3,Therion-'Arab Zaraq Lucid Dreaming'(Nuclear Blast America),"Another Swedish metal band.Best thing about 'Arab Zaraq...' is that it features some decent covers,like the Scorpion's ""Fly To The Rainbow"",Iron Maiden's ""Children of the Damned"" and Judas Priest's ""Here Come The Tears"".As for the band's originals,most of the CD here is okay.More like goth/metal.Nothing great,but then again it doesn't suck either.Might appeal to fans of Iced Earth,Kreator,King Diamond,Edge Of Sanity and Fates Warning.See what you think."
4,Whistle Stop,A long time ago my mother bought a new truck with a cassette deck and we had one of Roger Whittaker with some children's songs. My particular favorite was Whistle Stop and Google Eye. I would love to get a an MP3 recording of this one for my player. It was a beautiful piece and man can he whistle.
1,Poor Teaching Methods,"This video's presentation is poorly thought out. For example, when showing how to chip from the fringe, the camera only showed the instructor and the initial hitting of the ball. They should have also shown us the trajectory of the ball hitting the green and rolling to the pin so that we can get a better idea of the entire shot and what we are trying to accomplish with that specific technique.Also, the entire video is divided up into short sequences of less than one minute that require you to continually hit enter to play the next sequence. There does not seem to be a logical flow from one to the other and many are short meaningless fluff. There is too much dead space between each sequence."
3,"Clear Instruction, but Basic","The best part of this DVD was the chipping method. Keeping the heel of the club off the ground and using your putting stroke allows you to really use a sharp stroke, but the ball doesn't go too far.I would've liked to seen him cover pitching."
5,quality product,The product is well designed and quality production.If you considering anything less.... dont.Buy this unit.
3,input device overkill,"I bought and returned this item with the idea I would use it as an input device alternative to relieve some stress from my mouse. Not good for that application, you still have allot of motion which includes increased arm and wrist motion. As far as a drawing device its very good but the amount of drawing I do I accomplish with a rollerball, not Picasso stuff but simple shapes and objects. Those into serious illustration cant live with out this device though. The quality of the materials seemed very good."
1,"AWKWARD STYLE, NO EDITING","This book needs an editor. The stream-of-consciousness thoughts are not blended well with the dialog or action.Even worse are the sentence fragments. This book is written. In a very awkward. Writing style. A lot of. Incomplete sentences. And word phrases.Not much of a story, either."
5,.-. .- -.. .. --- .- -.-. - .. ...- .. - -.--,"This album has morse code on it, what more can you say......well some of that morse code actually sounds like that UA6 you just worked on 40 metres, complete with T6 buzz and slow drift.And the music is pretty good too."
3,"Buy it for ""Antenna""","I like Kraftwerk a lot, but frankly there's only one really good song on this CD: ""Antenna."" It's almost worth the cost of the CD, however!"
4,clearex,"clearex worked great . just like it was supposed to. easiest way i know of, to leach potted soil."
3,This book has a lot of example code.,This book seems like a lot more of sample reference code than anything else. It really doesn't teach very well how to do stuff but it does have a lot of code examples.
4,A memorable short book,"America's changing lifestyles in the early part of the 20th century and the effects of war on relationships, are some of A CUP OF TEA's principle themes. Although it aims to mimic Wharton-style settings and is remotely reminiscent of WASHINGTON SQUARE, TEA suffers from some glaring grammatical errors, (notably pronoun/antecedent agreement). Nevertheless, this is a novella that speaks to socially driven behavior and expectations and their role in romantic love and passion. (That's how I explain and excuse what some critics view as one-dimentional characters.) This is a simple story, that succeeds in remaining with you even though its ending is one we have seen before, or would expect. A good selection for a book club because it is discussionable."
2,don't believe the glowing reviews,The problem with the book is that Ms. Ephron does not know how to develop characters the way a writer in 1917 would. We are left with characters whose dialogue reads as if it were a TV script.
3,A page turner of questionable worth,"I couldn't put ""A Cup of Tea"" down. It definitely held my attention but so does a Grisham novel! When I finished it, I didn't have any sense of having been enlightened, touched, moved, etc. The characters are poorly drawn. The action is predictable. The prose is ""okay"". Its historical credibility is questionable. ""A Cup of Tea"" would make a perfect book to read on the beach where one's need for literary satisfaction is pretty simple."
1,Unbelievably bad,"Absolutely dreadful. Where was this woman's editor? The plot is the sort of thing a pre-adolescent girl might dream up, the characters are as dull as can be, and my 5-year-old can construct a better sentence than Ephron. At first, I kept reading because I thought there had to be a reason the book was this bad -- perhaps the author was playing some kind of trick on us. When it became clear she was serious, I started actually enjoying the book's awfulness, waiting to see how bad it could possibly get. Pretty darn bad, as it turns out, culminating in an absolutely ludicrous ending."
3,not a bad way to pass a short bus ride,"First off, this really is more of a novella or short story. It should take most readers under an hour and there's not much to focus on. The period detail consists of a hat shop and a few mentions of WWI and trenches. That's about it. If you want a New York period piece, try Jack Finney's Time and Again. I just read this and Richard Paul Evan's latest book in the same two day span. They both share a nice story, simple plot and two dimensional characters with sketchy love stories. Pretty blah. If you want to see the difference, pick up the work of a great writer -- I just started Philip Roth's The Human Stain and its writing alone blows these fluffy books away. If not for her name, I don't think any publisher would have jumped at this run-of-the-mill story. I enjoyed the book, but it was not a work of art. Stick to the Mansfield story it was based on."
2,Disappointing but at least quick,A Cup of Tea by Amy Ephron is a short book about wealthy woman who brings home a young girl she finds on the street for a cup of tea. The woman's fiancee finds the young woman irresistibly attractive and they begin to have an affair. You can guess the rest. The story is set in 1917 during WWI. I found the story to be predictable in parts and I found the author's ending to be very disappointing. Don't waste your time with this one.
2,"A quick read, but it wasn't that good","I read the back cover and I thought it would it would be really good. It was good in the beginning , but there were too many errors in verb use and stuff. Some of the sentences were really cheesy too. Very predictable."
5,My second favorite In Flames album,"This the heaviest in flames cd and while is very good, I just like The Jester Race better. The best thing about this cd is Worlds Within the Margin, which is one of my favorite songs of all time."
3,the cliche band at thier best,"contrary of every other cd this band has put out, this is the one I can stand the most. this is your cliche satanistic poser black metal band, nothing more. putting a band like emperor on thier heros list, and in mind. Dimmu borgir, tries to make thier own sound. This is the plain ridden with crap, and still this is there best album they came up with. hail to the next band that will play/tour with slipknot, linkin park, and manson mainstream. If you want to get into actuall black metal. go somewhere else. I'll buy this cd for ""mourning palace"" alone -- everyone has to take a cr*p every now and then!!"
5,Best Black Metal band ever,"Third album from the best Black Metal band (In my opinion.) Although some people disagree, Dimmu Borgir plays Black Metal. Enthrone Darkness triumphant was the first Black Metal album I bought and is still one of my favourite albums of all-time. On the album there are classic Dimmu Borgir tracks like Mourning Palace and In Death's Embrace. Enthrone Darkness Triumphant is not fully Black Metal. There are also other Metal influences. Occasionally the guitarist plays Heavy Metal and Thrash Metal riffs. The keyboard player plays a lot of classical piano parts, which gives it a Gothic/Classic vibe. The vocals sound raw in the traditional Black Metal way. Although more recent albums of Dimmu Borgir show improved writing compatibles, I still think that Enthrone Darkness Triumphant is their best album. I can recommend this album to anyone who appreciates diverse symphonic Black Metal."
4,An American tragedy,"What a fall from grace for one of America's ""model"" citizens in the war between good and evil. The story of Robert Hanssen, a man and a family who werre not who they appeared to be, is a good story. As a baby boomer who remembers the tensions of the Cold War era, and as a parent with children always looking for a good ""fable"" regarding making the right choices in life I liked the story.."
2,Didn't give me any clue on how to build web services on J2EE,"This book is not very useful for the average designer who wants to implement web services on a J2EE platform. It is more for managers and high level architects. It spends alot of pages on topics like business cases and ebXML, but JAX-RPC is covered in one single page. It does not focus on the core technologies you need to build a web service on a J2EE platform. The WS-I basic profile is hardly mentioned.If you are a programmer/designer/architect you should have a look at the book ""J2EE Web Services"" by Richard Monson-Haefel instead."
4,Steven Caney's Invention Book,"This book is great for those children who are interested in inventions or who are fasinated by interesting information. There are inventions that I have not seen covered in other books, as well as more common items. The pictures are great to look at, and the fantasty invention aspect allows kids to think about what invention they would like to create."
4,It's a webkinz - it's two toys in one!,"So says my seven-year-old daughter. ""And if you lose your real Webkinz, you still have the one on the internet to play with."" It's a toy, and a passcode in the tag to get on the Webkinz web site and play in their virtual world. That online world is pretty well put together, and it DOES have some educational value. The toy isn't too bad, either."
3,Very entertaining book,"I can't disagree with the other reviewers that say this book is original and intense. However, I'm struggling to find out how my running can benefit from Heinrich's advice. The problem I have with the book is that it's disorganized. It starts off comparing the physiology of animals and humans' running ability, and ends with Heinrich's triumph at the big ultramarathon. I'm not sure what message the author and publisher are trying to convey to me. I was totally enthralled though with the discussion of the physiology of animals. I guess I was hoping for more details on how a runner can best prepare for an ultramarathon."
1,Battery does not work for Minolta Dimage G500,"I bought this battery to replace the one I had for my Minolta Dimage G500 as it was advertised as such. Unfortunately, the battery even after charging it would not work. Disappointing."
2,5 star movie in 2 star format,"It is regretable that the producers of this DVD put in out in Full Screen (TV) format instead of Wide Screen format. John Ford's series of three pictures were shot in some of the most breathtaking scenery in America and chopping off the sides ruins much of the quality of this great film. IF you have to own a copy now then this might be worth it, but my recommendation is to wait for the Wide Screen edition to come out."
5,The DVD is in the correct aspect ratio !,"To the earlier reviewer who complained that the DVD is is full-frame rather than wide-screen- The movie was shot, as was typical of movies in the 40's, in a 1.33 / 1 aspect ratio. Thus, the DVD is presenting the film in it's original ratio. The DVD is a beautiful print."
1,The last thing we need is another WWII film about Vietnam,I don't understand the positive reviews for this garbage. This movie is just another WWII film that takes place in the 60s. WWII was NOT Vietnam!
4,Riveting Insights,"Becker again posits brilliant insights into the human condition and the psychological forces which motivate us. This is an early work, not as complete and relevant to his later, brilliant, The Denial of Death, but still definitely worth the read."
5,"Truly the most aggressive Techno/Electronica CD, ever.","Songs such as Virtual World, Zeitbombe, Sick Of You and My Condemnation are the coolest ever. If you're ever in an angry mood, then this CD will welcome to the world of Girls Under Glass."
5,Relentlessly Heavy,"Not much exists that is heavier than this. Meshuggah comes at you, claws and fangs bared, and pummels you into goo. But somehow it remains pleasurable. I have a lot of other metal in my collection but nothing quite like this. I have heard them dubbed ""math metal"". They experiment with different time signatures with good results. This is one of the things that makes them more unique in the metal world. There are quiet moments, but they are short lived. With Meshuggah you can count on their music being relentlessly heavy, and the vocals are very intense. If you are used to more conventional sounding music, Meshuggah may sound abrupt to you, but if you are bored with the same old sounds Meshuggah may be just what you are looking for. Destroy Erase Improve is a very good album."
4,Very good,"I am not usually a fan of the death metal style singing, which can unfortunately make up my mind for me about a band in a lit of cases. Fortunately, it did not make my mind up about this one. Being a fan of progressive and technical music, as soon as I heard 'Future Breed Machine', I had to get this album. The singer reminds me of old Fear Factory (but throatier), but the band is loads more technical. Time signatures fly by the wayside as these guys take you literally on a wild trip.What really sold me on this album, though, is the pure energy. Listening to this album makes me wanna go out and break something and just cause destruction and mayhem. My one and ONLY complaint with the album was the lack of technicality solo-wise. These guys obviously have the talent, I would just like to hear them show it off a little bit more. How about a band like Meshuggah combining their sound with a Symphony X style (or just with Michael Romeo)? I would pay a lot of caaaash to hear that."
5,Great Flash!,"When the EF 500 DG ST was out of stock I ponied up for this. Couldn't be happier! Not sure why it was given a two star review, that is uncalled for and ridiculous. Slave capabilities work just fine for me. Was not impressed by the Pentax offering at this price and I think this is comparable to the AF 540 Pentax flash."
5,managing the monkey,"Caffeine can be cruel. I regularly drink coffee at work, but if you are as lazy as I am on the weekends, you don't make a pot of coffee on Saturday morning, and in the early afternoon, you get a horrible headache from caffeine withdrawal. Enter the amazing Penguin Reds caffeinated mints. A few of these in the morning, (three equals the caffeine kick of a can of cola), and the monkey on my back is placated for the day. I keep a tin with me when I'm traveling for the occasional caffeine boost without having to stop for coffee of questionable quality at a convenience store, and I get the bonus of minty-fresh breath instead of coffee breath. Penguin mints rock. Penguin Reds rock harder."
4,"Good film, horrible DVD transfer.","I saw this film on TV many years ago some time after it hit the theatres. It was a period piece that was somewhat slow moving, but with excellent acting and overall production values. As others have stated Michael Caine puts in one of his absolute best performances ever. Everybody else does a superb job in the acting department as well. There are no missteps in the performances. Some of the camera work is a bit raw, but overall the film shines as a film.Even so the DVD transfer is a low bit rate, and the presentation suffers for it. A new transfer with the original edit on blu-ray would be welcome. If I had a critique of the film itself, it's that there aren't enough action sequences. I think one more might have helped bolster the film a bit more, but that's just me. Otherwise, as it stands now, it's outstanding, and deserves a better preservation on optical media.Hopefully a new transfer will come in time."
1,You can spend less money and get an unaltered version,"This is just a head's up to the people who haven't converted to Blu-Ray just yet, and were considering giving this DVD a purchase. The 5-star reviews for this product are all fake.Koch completely butchered this classic animated feature. The most notable alteration to the film was stretching the picture from its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio into a 1.77:1 aspect ratio so it will fill up the entire screen on an HDTV. As a result, Gulliver and all the characters look fatter than they actually are. Aside from altering the picture, sound effects have been added to the soundtrack that weren't originally there. Lastly, the two Gabby cartoons in the bonus features section are not outtakes from the movie. A series of Gabby theatrical shorts were actually made to build on the success of this feature film."
5,"wow, the sound and color!!!","I have wanted to see a really good copy of Gulivers Travels for a long time. The colors are bright and the sound, for the first time I have heard, crisp and clear, I can hear every word clearly! I wanted my kids to see this, its been a great memory from childhood, and I was not disapointed, they loved it! My 3 year old keeps saying ""My Gulvrs"" So, I would recomend it strongly as a bit of good clean fun, something we can all use right now!Max Fleischer's Gulliver's Travels [Blu-ray] I have just seen a regular DVD copy and it is almowt as good as the blue ray, the sound is really great, better than any other version, and I have seen them all. I have been a big fan of this film for many many years, this is as good as I could ever expect!"
2,Singing credits,"I had hoped that oneday I'll might find a copy of Gulliver's Travels that list everyone who had a part in singing the different Melodies’ of songs who had not been credited when this movie first came out back in 1939, because their was one perticular song that I had been trying very had to find out who sang it, but was not credited for singing ""I hear a dream"" during the making of this movie."
2,Vision obscured and sand gets moldy,"My son received this ant farm as a gift. In an attempt to be cute, the manufacturers painted one side of the plastic with goofy pictures - this means you can only see what's happening with the ants on the other side. Also, the sand gets moldy even after following the directions and limiting the water. If I ever get another ant farm it might be the gel type."
1,Terrible,"Unless you want to follow a bunch of annoying examples, this book provides little in the way of clear cut explanations. The explanations that are included are poor at best."
1,it's not compatible with Minolta A2,"This battery from BatteryGeneral IS NOT compatible with the Minolta A2 camera. The voltage doesn't match to original Np400 battery, the battery indicator in camera shows a fresh charged battery as almost fully drained!"
3,Warm and Wonderful!,"Funny and smart, a ""great escape""! Jane Wyman really lights up the screen! I was a stewardess in 1964/65 and this movie brought back memories of a time when ""service with a smile"" meant something!"
3,Cramps - 'Smell Of Female' (Restless),"First thing I couldn't help but to notice about this release,of course was the stunning cover where guitarist Poison Ivy looks extremely HOT!'Smell Of Female' is okay as far as a live album goes.It's got some good tunes like ""You Got The Taste"" and ""Faster Pussycat"" for starters.However,I see/hear two things wrong with 'Smell...'.One,the duration is just 33 minutes and two,their version of the 1967 Count Five garage/psych classic ""Psychotic Reaction"" is rather weak.I've seen the band play live twice now and I KNOW they can do better on that cover.I liked 'Rockin' N Reelin' In Auckland,NZ' and 'How To Make A Monster' better(see my reviews on both)."
3,"good, but it's NOT country, people!","i like this CD, but Shania is getting greedy for money and is coming out w/ pop stuff, and she knows she can still keep her country fans. it sounds like a good CD, but most of the music on it sounds the same."
1,"DVD quality poor, storyline poor","I am a Crawford fan, and also enjoy old B&W movies. But this is just so boring to watch, and you wonder why they bothered going on location to Catalina Island - all you mostly see is the stage stuff anyway. The film apparently got bad reviews when it was first released, and Crawford herself said if she could have re-done it, she would have as the overall film lacked spark -she also referred to her own acting as too over the top. This is one of her worst films in my opinion, yet it was one of the first they released on DVD. Why not release the good ones first - like Mildred Pierce? What's wrong with movie companies? The quality of this DVD is also really bad despite my copy saying ""Digitally remastered from the original print"". It was so poor that it kept fading in and out. For the collectors of oldies only. Sorry the review could not be more positive, but i dont want you wasting money on a bad product."
2,Rain,"The first time I saw this movie was on TCM.It was incredble!The first shot is of Joan's hand on the door then she comes around the door and we can see her face,then her body and you get the big time WOW factor. Well I bought the DVD because I loved the movie and most of all Joan Crawford. The problem is that the disc I got seemed washed out and the editing was not the same. The first time I saw this movie you heard music then saw a hand with nice polish then the face, Joan! The DVD I got in the mail did not have this beginning and it looked washed out. Not only was it changed from what I saw on TCM but the music wasn't there! Anyone who loved this movie the first time they saw it would be dissapointed in the DVD they purchase from Amazon! I feel very dissapointed! Do not purchase this DVD from Amazon!"
3,Enjoyable for Americans but not for Brazilian Listeners,"This is a showcase of the most recent Mr.Lins output just for American ears. Very good renditions in American terms from Sting, Chakka Khan but privilleged listeners of the originals should not enjoy as much. Some tracks show a negative quality gap when compared to the original rendition as is the case for Doce Presenca here registered by Dianne Reeves. Maybe some day EMI Records will wake up and issue the original Nana Caymmi rendition in the USA. Also English versions of Mr.Lins songs make completely different compositions out of the original ones, some with good but some with bad results. Alert: curiously, many reviewers here try to develop a comparison of Ivan Lins to Antonio Carlos Jobim just because they both come from Brazil. I think this is a useless task just because they are so different composers and musicians. It would be the same as comparing Bob Dylan to Duke Ellington just because they are Americans."
4,Always Ivan Lins !,"Im from Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, and I think that this album, a homage by Americans to the lovely music of Ivan Lins, is one of the best cds I've heard in 2000. Take a look at other people's rewiews and you'll certainly buy it."
1,Would not recommend at all,"The Prolab Pure Whey seems to satisfy everything that an individual is looking for in a protein supplement...nutrition facts that is. Apart from that, the powder tastes rather chalky. Don't even think about mixing it in water with a spoon or nything other than a mixer. I have tried almost every brand out there from EAS to Weider, and this is probably the worst thing. Would NOT recommend it to anyone."
2,Not upto claims!!!,It doesn't mixes well as has been claimed in the description and in other reviews...another problem that i faces is the wierd aftertaste it leaves in my mouth...i tried to return the product back to amazon but their return policy about food items are not that hassle-free either so ended up with a product that doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth.
4,A Great Departure,"This album shows Hypocrisy really coming into thier own musically. The departure of Masse Broberg left Peter in vocal control, and almost with entire creative control, which shows is a good thing. This album remains a little closer to the Penetralia/Osculum Obscenum era than it does to the later, more melodic era of Hypocrisy. None the less, this album shows Hypocrisy leaning toward more melodic, and heavier musical stylings. The songs ""Apocalypse"" & ""The Fourth Dimension"", along with additional track ""The Abyss"", gives hint as to where Hypocrisy is to be headed. This is not nearly my favorite album, but it is definetely a good Hypocrisy album to get into if you are a fan of more traditional, speed death metal."
2,Could have been so much better!,"Set up in part as a parody of Star Trek, comic books, Science Fiction and Horror movies and series, Free Enterprise brings to the screen the story of two geeky friends nearing their thirties as they go about their life with their every day problems, until one day they meet their number one hero, William Shatner, by chance and their whole world comes undone...As a major fan of comics and Science fiction, I was rather disappointed with the film in that the actors' performances are not that great, the plot and the music are mediocre, while the dialogues/humor could have been a LOT better.One good thing that comes out if it is Audie England who was delightful as Claire; let's see more of her!The potential for a good movie was definitely there, but it somehow fails to take off. A shame really...In all honesty it's pretty bad, though if you're a fan you might want to give it a try."
1,Music Video is the only thing worth it,I once watched this movie on HBO and it was horrible. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the final scene which had William Shatner doing a rap/hip-hop version of Marc Antony's funeral speech from Ceaser. I enjoyed it so much I bought the soundtrack. My dislike is probablly because Im a generation behind all the characters. If you were in your late twenties in the early 90's you might relate to this film.
3,A Sweet & Funny Film,"""Free Enterprise"" is a love letter to William Shatner. Long before his current renaissance and current appreciation, this movie captured the wit and talent of the man who is a cultural icon, but ""much, much more"" as his says on the wonderful Ben Folds' produced ""Has Been."" The film is rated R, which is great as it's not for kids with plenty of great eye candy. By far the best performances are Rafer Weigel as the cooler of the two nerds and Eddie Deezen who we haven't seen in far too long. The creator of ""Sledge Hammer"" does a funny cameo near the end which is sort of like what Tarentino did when he was in a movie telling his theories about ""Top Gun"". The gorgeous Chase Masterson is in one of the deleted scenes. She should have been in the picture as she's hot!"
4,An Excellent Quick Reference,"I actually read this straight through, like a novel, but it in no way approaches a novel nor a narrative history, but it is a very good quick reference for historical events and personages. Of interest, are at the beginning of the major divisions in the history are individual timelines of each of the peopled continents with significant events, with references to Gupta dynasties in India or Mali empire in Africa, which are sadly enough almost ignored in the interior. If you want a quick biography of historical personage, most likely it's in there, if you want a specific time and date for an event you can find it, but you if a view to extend beyond the myopic preoccupation with white europe, especially England, you maybe in for some trouble. This reference throws breadcrumbs of the events transpiring outside of Europe's grasp, but then never follows through. However, it is a good reference for the standard Euro-centric and traditional historical accounts."
5,We Love Handy Manny,We have only had the DVD for a few days now but my daughter has watched it multiple times and I can honestly say for any Handy Manny fan this DVD is cute enough for a family time movie. You will enjoy it from beginning to end. What a great buy.
3,Handy Manny DVD,I bought this trying to get my grandson into something different other than Bob the builder or Thomas the train. Not too much luck though. I think the movie is really cute but he still wants his regulars.
2,Cadderly the demigod,"While I enjoyed the premise, improved villians, and character development during the first 3 novels in this series, I found myself unable finish the 4th, as Cadderly has grown from a talented but sorely inexperienced initiate of Deneir to a virtual demigod.The attaction of Cadderly to me was the idea of a heroic character who survived as much on wits, intelligence, and able teamwork as overpowering force. And while this often held true through the initial books in this series, Cadderly is a one man wreaking crew here, his otherwise potent companions often serving as little more than conversation pieces and humour devices. Ancient red dragons, interplanar beings, arch magicians, the outcome of any encounter is never in doubt. Honestly, the only apparent way to defeat Cadderly is to gag him. While others may appreciate a seemingly omnipotent hero, I was gradually left without any feeling of suspense, and ultimately a lack of any interest to continue reading."
2,BLAME ON COMPAQ,"I`ve tryed to buy one for the last two months, and they are very hard to find, near IMPOSSIBLE to find. Accessories are even HARDER to find. Compaq created a little marvel to be seen on web stites, but not used in the real-world. It would be better than the competitio if it were available... The lack of a serial cradel exculdes Win 95 and NT. COMPAQ EXECUTIVES ARE LAUGHING AT US RIGHT NOW: ""YOU CAN LOOK BUT YOU CAN`T BUY, AND EVEN IF YOU BUY YOU CAN`T HAVE THE NEEDED ACCESSORIES... JA JA JA JA!!!!!"" ""KEEP DREAMING BELOVED CUSTOMERS!!!!"""
2,Phone Support leaves product out in space,"I went out on a limb and bought 10 of these for my company leadership. They look great, but getting any useful information from Compaq is a joke. These things don't run on NT out of the box not that anyone tells you that. Compaq has no clue when the serial cradle will be available (they don't even claim to sell them) and I was transferred 4 times to get that information. We chose Compaq over HP based on customer support. At this point I'm thinking of sending all of them back and getting HPs since it seems that they are both at the same level."
5,AMAZING,"This is an amazing product. Irecently bought it after playing with 2 other pocket pc's: The journada and The casio, The handheld pc's (W/ the key board) are way too bulkey. Having an on screen keyboard is not that much of an Inconvenience as many people may think."
3,"Amusing Stats, Runs Linux...","It is entertaining that the description indicates that the iPAQ uses a ""real Intel processor;"" what it contains is a StrongARM, produced by a consortium that included Digital/Compaq, whose fabrication facilities were purchased by Intel. It certainly wasn't designed by Intel, and has no compatibility with Intel's IA-32, IA-64, or other microcontroller lines.The other ""claim to fame"" of the iPAQ is that its design is based on the Digital/Compaq ""Itsy"" design, a StrongARM handheld running Linux and the X Window System. Compaq engineers are now working on making the iPAQ a usable platform for running Linux and X. ..."
3,Can't Connect Online,"The iPAQ H3650 has great features, and a fast processor, which makes it perform like a laptop, but Compaq has dropped the ball not including an Expansion Pack with the Unit. I can't buy one anywhere, and Compaq claims they won't have them available at the Direct Plus Store for another month or longer! I purchased the Hand Held to connect online with Internet Explorer for Pocket PC. You cannot do that with this device as it ships from Compaq. You need the Jacket, or Pack with a PC or CF Slot in it. The other two brands have the slot in the units, and I am seriously considering switching to one of them. Sorry Compaq, but a High End user wants the connectivity!"
2,Disappointed.,"This game is heavily developed based on the actual movie. If you haven't seen the movie, and/or your kid was too young to understand the plot, then they might not get the game.Most of the adventures are based on the story plot. A lot of the adventures are a bit dumb, like McQueen bumping alphabet tires into a truck, McQueen tipping over the tractors based on counting smoke rings, McQueen herding the tractors back into the pen, McQueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes, McQueen driving down a road looking for Mack based on memory, McQueen dodging the firetruck water blast, etc. The only adventure I liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers (odd vs. even) and installing them on the race car.Don't buy this game unless your kid is obsessed with Cars."
1,Do you value your time? Yes? Good. Avoid this movie!,"Despite the fact that Eye of the Beholder has two relatively capable and interesting young actors, it fails to perform the job a good movie does...to entertain. The main problem with this movie is the fact that it is not coherent. It lacks a degree of structure and clarity necessary to allow the viewer to comprehend the story. Most of the so-called 'developments' are absurd and unbelievable. Why does Ewan McGregor suddenly become so obsessed with Ashley Judd? What happens to the mental projection of his daughter? What happens at the end? Does she die? What is she saying to him?...it's incomprehensible. I am a very intelligent person...I read Dostoevsky and Nietzsche for pleasure...but this movie made no sense to me."
2,"Good lead performances, good premise, LOUSY movie.","Ashley Judd and Ewan MacGregor are two of my favorite actors, especially since seeing Mr. MacGregor in ""Moulin Rouge"". So we had to see this movie. But it was such a let-down. The plot never unfolded, it never went anywhere, there was no dramatic conclusion, no conclusion at all in fact, no satisfying ending. One of the worse endings of any movie I've ever seen. We all looked at each other and said, ""That's it?!?!"" It felt like a 3-hour movie."
2,WHEREIN LIES THE BEAUTY?,"EYE OF THE BEHOLDER is one of those films that revels in its artistic vacuum. Sure, director Stephan Elliott gives us some moody visuals, appealing camera angles and two performances by Ashley Judd and k.d. lang that far outclass the movie. Ewan McGregor's loneliness is so telegraphed and forced he becomes a mere tool in the film. And ultimately in spite of its artistic merits, where does it end? Why would anyone fall in love with a serial killer; his wife and daughter left him--so what, life goes on. His obsession with her, in my opinion, does not justify wanting to ""save"" her. She's coldblooded, heartless and intrinsically selfish. Lonely--it's her choice, just as it is his. The ending...why in the world is Judd so upset that McGregor knows what she's done?Ashley has gone on to make better movies; she's a very good actress. Too bad the script didn't use her better."
1,THE WORST FILM!,This is absolutely by far the worse film I have ever watched (endured is more like it).
2,"Not too bad, but not too good","I actually had this on my shelf for 2 or 3 years. I tried to watch it a time or 2 and just could not get past the first 10 or 15 minutes. I was finally in the mood to watch it the other night. Let me say I am a big fan of Ashley Judd and I have loved every movie I have seen her in. She did a great job, as always, just poor script writing. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, such as how he always manages to keep one step ahead of her in order to place cameras in her hotel rooms, etc. This fellow was so obsessed and in the end what was the point? I may have to watch it again in a few more years just to see if there is something I missed...."
1,OH THAT MY EYES HADN'T BEHELD THIS,"To call this movie an abomination would be too generous! If Trashley Dudd had tied me down and defecated in my face, she couldn't have inflicted on me anything worse than this cinematic atrocity."
1,"If I could give it less than 1 star, I would","This is one of the worst movies of all times. Even bad B-films have their redeeming qualities within the genre. This movie, however has nothing to say and takes up two hours of your life doing it. You'd be better off staring at a blank screen for the same amount of time. Please skip this one and save yourself."
