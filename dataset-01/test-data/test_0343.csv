1,"too small, too fragile",Cute but legs are just felt & tore off after a few days. Smaller than it looks in photo. My daughter was very disappointed & I wouldn't recommend it.
2,"Good First Effort, BUT...","There are a LOT of grammatical errors in this book, from missing quotation marks on conversations to bad paragraph structure to phrases like ""she use to visit"". While I applaud Ms. Braxton's first effort, the editing was horrible. It made the story a bit confusing, because sometimes you can't tell that dialogue has changed from one character to the next."
5,Crying Shame by Sharon Braxton,"Crying Shame is HOT! It's a book you must add to your book list. Crying Shame is one of those books, once you start reading it, you will not want to put it down. (Cece/ Massachusetts)"
1,Horrible Piece of Self-Help Work,"This book is basically a collection of other people's stories. The author does little more than repackage others' stories/experiences in a ""collection"" of anecdotes that may (or may not) be applicable to readers' situations. Most of the situations are EXTREME (drug abuse, sexual abuse, etc, so be warned. I suggest you look elsewhere for a self-help book on reconciliation."
4,Works as advertised...,Works as advertised...though...place it near where you want to hear it...the alarm is not loud...sounds more like a watch alarm.
1,Too quiet,"This ""alarm"" is too quiet. It wouldn't wake up a mouse. It measures 56db @ 12"" from the device.For comparison, the fan on the freezer I wanted to protect is 54db.It needs to be at least as loud as a cell phone.Useless for me."
2,Disappointed,"I liked the price, the shipping was fair and the design is outstanding. Problem is that it's not loud enough. My watch alarm is louder. Can't see it waking me up. Quite disappointed overall."
5,good idea,I needed a power failure alarm which could wake me if power goes out during the night. The alarm is not real loud but it can wake you up if plugged in near your bed.
1,Crap!,"The beeper volume sounds like an old digital watch: definitely not 86dB! More like 60dB.**This can barely be heard even from across the room, never mind from the basement or garage. If it goes into alarm during the night and if it doesn't wake you up immediately -which is a certainty, then the battery gets weaker and the beeper volume drops even lower! Completely useless.** for a generic volume chart see [...]"
4,Emergency alarm!,"It's very nice...but like others said...the alarm is not very loud.It's like a wrist watch alarm!I have a wood furnace, and when the electricity goes off it would heat up real fast.This is a good product to alarm me to close it down!"
1,Absolutely Worthless - Save your money!,"Thought this was my solution to knowing when the freezer lost power. I plugged it in on a Sunday, by Wednesday wee hours of the morning it was going off! I went down to check it and found no power issue.....but that didn't stop it from sounding...just kept going and going! Complete failure!! It flat out does not work like promised! I'm very disgusted with this product!! I hope my review will save someone else from making the same mistake I did in buying this product!"
3,A snoozer,"I've read several Turow novels before this one and enjoyed each of them quite a bit. I have to say, though, that if this had been the first of his works I'd read, I probably wouldn't have read a second one or even finished this one. My primary complaint about this story is that I found it to be slow and boring. The flashbacks were tedious, the characters weren't very appealing and the story wasn't exactly gripping. All in all, I call it a snoozer.But, I do know Turow is capable of much better work and I wouldn't want to steer anyone away from it. Just avoid this turkey. Three stars is probably way too generous."
2,Weakest of the Turow Novels,"Before encountering The Law of Our Fathers, I had enjoyed reading everything written by Scott Turow, beginning with L1, his memoir of his first year of law school at Harvard. But, alas, this book just didn't hold together. The characters were interesting, and the writing decent, but the story failed to hold my interest. Every good writer to takes some risks and Turow is entitled to one less than stellar work. I look forward to reading his next!"
1,Snoring and disappointing,"I have to admit that I listened to the audio version first, then for what I have yet to determine reason, I punished myself with the book. I was so disappointed. A waste of time. I had eagerly awaited the tapes for a cross country motoring trip. I had to listen to it on a personal cassette player or wear earphones when I used the builtin player because my husband thought it was so boring he couldn't drive and stay awake! I had trouble as well listening to the tapes and reading the book! I finally got through it, but I think it was mostly because we were on vacation."
1,Forget it... a snoozer,"This is definately not one of Turow's best books. I have enjoyed many of his others, but this one gets lost between the present day (mid-90's) and the 60's. I know he was trying to set the sage for the present day story with background of the characters relationships in a different time and place, but the reader gets lost in too much detail and extraneous information."
2,I had to force myself to finish this one,"I've read all of Turow's books and have always been captivated from beginning to end. How different this one is! I'll finish it out of sheer obstinacy, but I have had a very hard time staying interested. I lived through the campus protests of 1970, and I still couldn't connect with it. I'm less than 100 pages from the end, and I'm still trying to figure out what's it's about! I keep thinking there's a plot in here somewhere! I will definitely think twice about buying another Turow book if this is representative of what he's going to write."
2,What to read and what to skip,"If you have glanced at the other reviews, you know that the main problem with this novel is that it mixes good court drama with endless and boring reminiscences about the 1960's.To actually enjoy the novel instead of dying of boredom, read the chapters where the characters are at court. Skip everything else, except, at the end, ""Summer 1995 - NILE"" and pages 813 through 817.The court drama is actually quite good, IMHO. The tricks of the sneaky defense lawyer are very interesting and quite enjoyable.Four stars for the court drama, zero stars for everything else. Average result: Two stars."
4,Complex and complete,"This is a book not for the timid-hearted nor the shallow Grisham-lover. Despite overromanticizing the sixties (especially when the seventies generation deserves the credit anyway), Turow weaves of masterful tale of personal and criminal intrique. He traverses through racial, gender, and generational barriers with great skill and leaves any reader over 30 wondering about life, relationships, ethics, and weakness. Not a modern classic, but give Turow credit, it is a step in the right direction."
1,His worst work by so far he can't even see it.,"I have read all of his books and enjoyed them. This book, however, is so boring I can't believe anyone would compare him to Grisham. He has continually gone downhill since Presumed Innocence, although the others were at least entertaining. This was so bad I don't believe I can ever read another book by him."
2,Needed A Better Editor,"I think the author was trying to fit two books into one here, a view of the 60's race relations and a legal thriller. Becuase of that I think the thriller got a little crowed out. I have no issue with the story line and some of the detail, but I thought it took more away from the book then it added. He is known for writing tight, suspenseful legal thrillers, great fiction that you can sink your teeth into. The subtle preaching of societies wrongs also left a bad taste in my mouth, I am looking for fiction when I pick on of his books up. On the other hand he is a good author who writes in a somewhat complex way so that you have to pay attention. This is not the McBook of Grisham, but a deeper telling of a story. He has put out much better books in the past and I would suggest starting with them before taking on this beast of a book."
3,In Serious Need of an Editor,"A long, and at times, slow read, this story could have used some fine-tuning before sending it off to the printer. Some characters ring true, while others seem like poor characterizations. Not Turow's best work."
2,Where's the Beat?,"I've had this DVD about a year and a half now, but have never been able to get into it because of the issue I have reconciling the instructions and music with my steps. I never had a problem with coordination, but this workout gives me such a complex that I usually end up marching to the beat. Would not be my first choice."
2,Case of Passive aggressive,"That's how i felt when i read the part describing Slim (Nancy Keith). He never really outright says bad things about her himself. But quotes various social figures who bad mouth her for him. Basically it seems that Slim and Blass were a 'couple' for sometime, and that on a vacation together, Slim has a plan to talk marriage with Blass. When he senses this, he just left the vacation home without telling her.I feel bad for Slim. Judging from all these New York socilites' terrible words on her, she must had a lonely social life at the end when she became a single girl. She had her faults, but she was an unique American character: with Extraordinary look and sense of style unlike any others. She also had warmth and coziness that was unique to her.Judging from just this episode alone, I don't think Bill Blass was a gentleman."
4,extremely good - though not excellent,"A theme I'd like to see tackled more often. Although this effort is an entirely successful book, I could hope that more were made of the possibilities it opened up."
3,Doesn't get a full seal,"Seals well enough to extend the life of produce, cheese or use for freezer, but items tend to stay a bit loose still. Read the manual well, it's a bit tricky to get going."
1,You get what you pay for.,"The sealer works ok, but I could not get the vacuum to remove all of the air."
3,Petrol has it's ups and downs,"Sometimes they find some great music, others times, they turn out to be bland (depends on what you're looking for).Heres is mostly slow-paced, old-school French music, you know, the kind you here around the streets of Paris or in one of their cafes.The only exception was the song ""colore"" by ""Les innocents"" it's a good blend of traditional, and more modern French music.If you want to find a playlist of World Music that has more variety in sounds, look up ""Rough guide to"" or ""Putumayo"".you'll have better luck with those guys."
4,Makes a world of difference!,"I was skeptical at first. ""If the shave cream protects my face, what do I need oil for?"" But after trying i'll have to eat my words. This oil is a necessity!! It transforms your shave. Rinses clean and doesnt harm complexion. Took off one star 'cause its pricey, but at twice the cost I would still buy it."
5,Forget what the other people said.This stuff is great,you guys say this stuff is way over priced but if you look at the fact that castor oil and olive oil is not cheap when you get into the all natural high quality stuff and maybe you did not know but pure high quality lavender oil can cost you $30-50 for a 5ml bottle . Spending $22 in a all ready mixed bottle is not that bad.If you want quality stuff you have to pay for it and as far as I can tell the Art of shaving line is one of the highest quality lines around.I say if you care about your skin and your shave get this stuff
5,OMG OMG OMG close your eyes and grab it...,"I usually write reviews only for products which impress me... I just used this right now for shaving (my wife's gift)... I was like, what is this pre-shave stuff ??Applied and then saw the writing that I need to apply lather on top of this... Iz like... what the hell !!!But when I shaved... the effect was mindblowing... my skin was sooo smooth that if I dont write a positive review, that would be a crime...Go for it... !!!"
2,Would not spend my $$ on this again,"""Softens the beard""...sort of. Like one of the reviewers has said...you can get this softening effect at a fraction of the cost. 20 bucks? heck no. For 20 bucks I was expecting wonders."
4,Good Book on Leadership,"There are a lot of good and lengthly reviews for this book, so I will be brief. This book is a fast read and is very interesting. Professor Cohen, head of Strategic Studies at John's Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies (SAIS), lays out through representative case studies examples of civil-military command during war, with specific focus and emphasis on the interface of civilian command and military command. I thought the book was an excellent overview of some of the issues involved in this most important subject."
2,Not a well thought out book.,The writer tries to generalize from the experience of four great statesmen in war times to make a conclusion that politicians should tell generals what to do!I think this book is political biased.Say if I was to reverse the equation and generalize from the experience of four great generals to make a conclusion that generals should tell statesmen what to do! Would the writer agree with me?I could also write a few essays where democratic leaders just left his military leaders to do their job and the military leaders did a very good job eg prime minister Eshkol of Israel in the six day war and the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indian Gandhi in December 1971 in the Indian Pakistan war. Is the conclusion now that statesmen should stay out of the actual war.Also I should stress is that most people are not *great*. To try to generalize from a few great men is a very dangerous experience. Great men by their nature are gifted and unusual.
3,BE READY TO INVEST SOME personal TIME,"This educational software will be helpful to any child's knowledge, BUT be ready to invest time into ""dowloading"" software patches from the Topics Entertainment website.I guess there were some software difficiencies in the CDs, so you have to invest some time into fixing these deficiencies. Its pretty easy, but don't expect to download the software into your computer and be able to run all the programs instantly."
2,Could have been better,"The idea is right but the script could have used a little work. Rich girls are usually smart and know what not to do during pregnancy. April plays a dumb ""white girl"" yet has smart moments where she catches on to what the first wife was doing. The argument in the kitchen could have been better from Aprils side. After all the woman tried to kill her baby!Ending was terrible. Bottomline is a happy marriage and a family is split up because of the selfishness of the first (and seemingly dead) wife. Ugh"
5,My daughter and her husband loves this movie.,"I ordered this dvd for my daughter and she loves it. She says its a good movie and that the seller sent it in good condition. Everytime she and I talk she and her husband has just watched or are going to. I would definitely recommend this company to family, and friends."
4,Cute movie!,"Good quality, shipped before time and was like new as stated. I saw this movie on BET and I knew I needed it for my home movie library. Not Oscar worthy acting, but very original plot and entertaining."
3,Of mixed feelings,"This is a film that you should rent before you buy it. Some of the logic of this film is just wrong, but I actually enjoyed the film. The whole idea is pliable, but not realistic because of legal issues which aren't addressed at all. The script needed some work on it, but Cheri Johnson does make a good attempt to carry this film, but even she struggles to do it at times.If you are into modern day ""Black Cinema"", it is worth seeing at least once, but rent it to make sure that you really want to buy it and add it to your collection."
4,Not enough aerobics,"I really enjoyed the ease of this workout with Kathy Kaehler. I have never tried a video of hers before. It definitely is the basics because I knew most of the exercises. I found it a little lacking in the aerobic portion. I don't think any ""total"" fitness workout can only have five minutes of aerobic exercise, and then 30 minutes of strength training. Also, I am doubtful of how much benefit you would receive of only doing five minutes here and there. I really like Kathy, the exercises were easy to do, and I do feel I will benefit from them. But I wish the aerobic exercise was extended. I almost feel I need to do the video twice to get a real workout."
1,This Band Sucks!!!,"Over rated, over produced bomb DO NOT WASTE A CENT ON THIS ALBUM AND KEEP MALL GOTH OUT OF THE SCENE."
3,Five for the original United Artists' version minus two for the edited Jet version,"Originally released in June 1976, this LP was originally compiled by United Artists Records as a promotional album for American radio stations, but when copies of the LP started selling to fans ""underground"" United Artists decided to release it in the U.S. to capitalize on the band's growing popularity. The original United Artist release included full length versions of all the songs. Unfortunately, when Jet records picked up the release many of the songs were edited. My first copy was the UA release and was quite surprised when I picked up a copy years later to find that many of the songs were edited. Four for the original release marked down two for the edited versions."
4,"Aptly titled, a definate must for a To-The-Point Collection!","The music is in the Classic Jeff Lynne Style, one which, sadly, he maitained barely into the '80's.I agree wholeheartedly with the original ALBUM Cover statement that ""Ma Ma Ma Bell SHOULD have been the bands' breakthrough hit""...The opening riffs are pure gold rock & roll!The haunting Viet Nam era tune ""Kuiama"" and ""Roll Over Beethoven"" were the surprise disapointments of the CD as they have been chopped up and shortened considerably from what was released on the original record album. This is the main reason the CD draws a 4 star rating from the original 5 star material.If you're one of those collectors that seek only to grasp the best of a bands' best, you CAN NOT do without THIS CD of ELO hits...""Definitive"" isn't the KEY word...It's the ONLY word to describe OLE'ELO!"
4,Great fun! Keeps them busy!,"Its really a great toy, keeps my 6 year old daughter very busy and she enjoys the dimensions. Not too thrilled with the message it teaches though, the pixel chick is a real snob!"
2,Sound but no comfort,"Shares excellent drivers with KSC35, KSC75, Portapro and Sportapro models. That is good--very rich sound with the perfect amount of bass emphasis.However, as others have mentioned, the band is way too narrow--almost like it's made for children. I doubt any male head will fit into these things without the band digging into the sides of your scalp! Like the previous reviewer, I made the mistake of trying to bend the band to widen it--snap! And these were brand new!!! Luckily, the lifetime Koss warranty came through to replace it for only $6 s/h. Because the headphones are brutally unforgiving for my head, they are still in the package unworn. I highly recommend the behind the head band style of the Sportapros if you like this style (I DO--I can wear a cap without band interference) and feel it is more easy and comfortable to wear than the clip-on ear style of the KSC75/35."
4,comfortable and breathable,"My newest Jobst knee-hi support hose (20-30) are a more comfortable fabric blend than the older style. When I first took them out of the package, I was afraid I would have difficulty pulling them on. No more so than before. The support is good, but never feels tight. The foot is long enough for my size-10 foot. Although I am 5'7"" I find that they are a bit long, coming onto the knee cap. If it weren't for that, I would give them a 5-star rating."
5,Beethoven Songbirds TRACK LIST:,"(1) Symphony No. 6 in F, op. 68, ""Patoral"" - Allegretto (2) Piano Sonata No. 14 in C# minor, op. 27, ""Moonlight"" - Adagio sostenuto (3) Symphony No. 2 in D, op. 36 - Larghetto (4) Violin Sonata No. 5 in F, op. 24, ""Spring"" - Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo (5) Symphony No. 6 in F, op. 68, ""Pastoral"" - Andante molto mosso (6) Violin Concerto in D, op. 61 - Rondo = EXCELLENT CD to Own & Enjoy"
4,am I the only one who found it hilarious?,"All right...so it wasn't a GREAT novel. There were a good number of parts where the writer's 'jokes' were ill-timed and ill-fitting. Meaning, some parts were extremely corny and stupid. I was laughing throughout the entire book. Junius Podrug is a decent writer, and his depiction of Russia and Russian jurisprudence makes shivers run down my spine, and makes me feel very, very lucky to live in America. I suppose the fact that I read the ending when I was still around page 5 made me want to finish it. However, the book was not especially understandable at certain parts, especially at the end. Perhaps I am too immature and young to understand a novel of its uh...caliber. Haha, sure. Well, Presumed Guilty is not a book I'd recommend, but I certainly like it. It kept me focused throughout the entire book, even throughout all the corny and sexist and explicit parts of it. ""Little Kosca""...hahaha!"
4,Wonderful Story !!!,This short account of a true story of two young men and their quest to have a first summit attached to their names is wonderful. Their undaunted courage and lasting friendship make this a great story to hand down to your children.
5,Cute!,I ORDERED THIS FOR MY CLASSROOM FOR OUR OWL UNIT. THE KIDS ENJOYED ACTING OUT STORIES AND PUTTING ON PUPPET SHOWS FOR THEIR PEERS.
1,"Just sweet, no flavor","Had purchased this years ago and didn't care for it, but thought now w/Splenda and the good reviews, it had to be good. Wrong. They get you to bite w/the Kahlua on the label, but there is no comparison to Kahlua, doesn't taste at all like Kahlua. Actually it doesn't really even taste like coffee. It has just a sweet artificial flavor, but not a coffee flavor. Very disappointing."
5,nice CD,"I have most of the songs on other CD's, but to have them all on a new 2 disk set is very convenient. I love the songs.Great background music for the holidays."
4,"Between 2 musical worlds: ELO's ""transitional"" album","The face of radio was changing and by the end of 1975 ""FM"" as a format effectively ceased to exist. Many bands at this time began changing their styles, leaving the ""excesses"" of Progressive Rock behind them in a bid to become more ""commercial"". On ELO's FACE THE MUSIC, the glorious sounds and arrangements of ELDORADO were maintained, but the songwriting was clearly aiming more for Top-40 AM than anything Jeff Lynne had done since 1968. ""Fire On High"" is a spectacular album opener, combining orchestral sweeps with rocking guitar. With that out of the way, the rest relatively ""normal"", if only in comparison. ""Evil Woman"" is actually the one ELO song I came to HATE from too much radio exposure, but I think it works much better as part of the whole album. ""Nightrider"", ""Poker"", ""Strange Magic"", ""Down Home Town"" and ""One Summer Dream"" --this entire album has grown on me SO much over the years! And yet, for me, the best was still to come..."
4,amazing,I lived only 45mins away from Skara Brae and read this book as a kid. Living so close to where the book was set was really something for me. It's a book that conjures up loads of different emotions for a young reader (1st read it when i was 9) and now 15yrs later i'm trying desperatly to find a copy and recapture those feelings again. If you've read it you know what i mean...and if you haven't get out there and find yourself a copy and get reading. If anyone manages to find someone/anyone that sells it could they let me know i really really want it!!!!
4,"Chong, Bongs, aand Boobs!","Tommy Chong and Evil Bongs!!!! How can you go wrong?? There's lots of fun here. You got your group of stoners (think the gang from Half Baked but more clueless) that stumble on a bong with magic powers, but not the good kind, the bad kind... the EVIL kind. Once you smoke this bong you're sent into this evil world filled with strippers that try to kill our heroes (not a bad way to go) and now they must find a way to destroy this evil bong. Tommy Chong is hilarious as the guy who has gone up against this bong before. He's got that classic stoner's charm that has made him famous. I couldn't stop laughing at all the goofy stuff these guys were doing. This is your perfect stoner flick with hilarious moments and naked chicks. I mean, this is no masterpiece but if you like some just dumb fun entertainment it's certainly worth a watch. And I just heard that a sequel's coming out in July!!!! I can't wait to check it out. I hope they make a long line of the movies in the future."
1,Don't buy this product!,"The quality of these cards is poor. They are the size of a deck of cards. The black and white drawings are crude. They are not ""ring-bound""; they just have one hole in them. I recommend Trail Guide to the Body instead."
5,The BEST I've seen in years.,"Miss Reba, Thanks for making a wonderful movie I can watch with my family. We loved it. Hope you make more like this one. The rest of the indurstry should take your lead in good movie making."
3,good live album!,"By the time Live Bootleg came out in 78,Aerosmith was burnt out on drugs and their popularity was about to decline,shortly after this.The songs that are on the album are great,represents their first decade very good.My only complaint is that the band being burnt out,they are kind of sloppy and at times unteresting.Good CD and great songs,just not performed at their very best.I would recommend for hard core fans,casual fans would be better surved with the regular studio albums."
5,No BS,"Raw, rough, fast, loud, irreverent, dirty, smarmy, fast, crumpled, lean, soulful, fast.....LIVE! Remember when bands used to play faster and sloppier in concert - and it was accepted? Hell, if any band played their songs faster live anymore they wouldn't be able to follow the click-track that has been surgically implanted in the drummer's head (lest he be fired). This is what concerts used to be."
1,Doesnt work,I dont know if I got a faulty CD but this one just doesnt want to install. I wasted an hour tryn to figure it out but in vain. My system faaaaaar meets all its specifications
1,don't purchase,"horrible stapler. the spring broke before i even used it once, and the shipping cost as much as the item. you would be out of your mind to buy this item. i would have given it less than one star if the option existed."
4,for the collector,"Contents: Box big enough to hold the entire series. Includes a 1/6 scale action figure of Hand Maid May. Figure has 9 points of articulation and comes with stand. Some assembly required. Also includes a CD-ROM disk (in a dvd case) with additional production, images and story information from the show. You'll need a web browser, 1024x768 screen and 64meg of memory to use (according to the box it's Mac & Windows friendly). Includes NO dvds, just the space (once the model is removed) to store them."
5,Original Sound... Not For Everyone!,"I personally love this band. I think this album is better than the first, after listening to it for a while. I can see how HH can be hated by some though. It's definately not for everyone."
2,funny stuff,"LMAO im having an awesome time reading these reviews. there are actualy more bad reviews than good ones and theyre all funny! but to be honest i think alot of the negative things people are saying about this band are not very thought out. yes, alot of their songs do sound almost exactly the same and yes they do make the stereotype for emo all about cutting and being sad but the only people here calling it emo are those who are being critical about hawthorne heights. if you want to make a new word for bands like hawthorne heights maybe you should. that way you wont be able to say theyre crap just because they are not like real emo bands"
1,Victory Records and all the bands signed to them SUCK!,"Avoid at all costs. Do not touch Hawthorne Heights, a group that repeats their choruses ad-nausem. Victory Records sign the worst bands on the planet, and will even tell them to change their sound. They rip-off the artists they do sign and don't give them much money. They are polluting and flooding the scene with loads of -core bands, far too many of them who have little to no real talent and the vocalists can't do proper screams and sound forced. I recommend getting bands signed to the Ferret label, most of them are decent."
5,It's a must have for small hands.,I love my paddle gloves. My hands are small which makes it difficult to paddle out as fast as other surfers. I'm able now to keep up. It's a must have!
4,A very true and funky jazz album,"I chose this album since the track ""Getaway Day"" was a song that was sampled by Musiq on his latest project. But after giving Tom Scott's whole CD a listen, I was definitely impressed. It was definitely funky and has its sensual moments as well. A very thorough album which I recommend to any jazz aficianado"
4,Great compilation of contemporary celtic music,"This is a terrific album. Some compilation albums can be uneven, this is consistently good. Loreena McKennitt's Anachie Gordon is very good, from one of her earlier albums. I especially like the 4th track, Tonight Is Just For Us. This is a CD I'll listen to a lot.I also like the fact that they published the lyrics in the liner notes.With the explosion of celtic music, there is a lot available - good, bad, and mediocre, and of course a lot of it depends on personal taste. To gauge similar tastes, I also like Loreena McKennitt, Clannad/Maire Brennan, Sinead O'Connor, the Putamayo Celtic Women of the World 1 (but not 2), and the Women of Heart series."
5,Celtic Woman,I especially like this Vol. 1 group of music by this inspirational group of women with melodies.
3,Expectations,While I enjoyed this volume I was disappointed that it was not as good as Celtic Woman. Maybe when I listen to it again I might change my view.
1,buy vol.2,"Few selections good. If you love Loreena McKennittkeep buying her work, skip this cd and buy vol.2 of this title.Vol. 1 will not keep your ear interested for long."
4,People admire this bag,"Its great because of all of the pockets and boy do I like pockets! One friend offered to buy it from me and I may give it to him since its not as suitable for me as a woman. I need something softer that opens up in a more rounded fashion like a huge open purse. I love the look and construction but I need something bigger to hold all of my personal items, my lunch, plus my drawing pad and about 50 markers since I'm an artist and never know when I may want to draw. Its hard for me to let go of it because its so darn cool looking and well made!"
5,highly recommend,"Wonderful book. For all siblling out there who can relate for a multitude of reasons, this is the book to get."
1,Presents worst-case only - unbalanced and self-serving,"I read this book to gain insight as I have a disabled child and several other children. The author of this book has a very skewed version of reality. Even her own culture promotes the kind treatment of the disabled and mentally ill, yet she feels ""Normal"" siblings would benefit from having the other child institutionalized. The scenes described int his book do not occur in our home as we are active and involved parents, not misguided and overly indulgent while ignoring the ""normal child"" which is the only description of parents afforded in this book."
3,Not like shaved ice,"Purchased the after shave lotion with great anticipation after reading reviews. However, although the lotion feels good to the skin it doesn't have the 'shaved ice' feel as promoted. In fact, it doesn't seem any cooler than other much less expensive brands typically purchased at most stores. I will not order this product again."
4,"Lots of Fiction, Not much Historical","If you want a steamy, fun book, this is it. But do not use this book as a basis for your History project.But for enjoyment on a cold wintry night -- it is perfect."
5,One of Peter Jennings' best!,"When Peter Jennings died this was a video I had in my collection and watched it because I was there in Times Square for well over 20 hours watching the celebration unfold.It was quite the event I will never forget to this day with the dawning of the Millennium. Thanks to the ABC 2000 tape I recalled all the moments from around the world as we watched it together outside the ABC studios in New York. I was proud of Peter Jennings' coverage that day and night plus we can't forget Dick Clark's countdown. As one of Peter Jennings' outstanding works, this was a classic! Thanks Peter."
1,ABC 2000 the New Millennium Highlights,"This is a great display of ABC's talking heads and not to bad display of American celibrations but lacked showing the Celibrations around the world. Since America was not the best celibrations I am not sure why ABC wanted to feature it. I wanted to see the great music and fireworks and dancing, not talking heads!..."
5,finger licking good,"This book encapsulates most of what I've wanted to believe as a Christian but was afraid to believe as a Christian because of what other Christians might think about me. Driscoll's Luther-like qualities are unlike any pastor I know of in the 21st century American church. Driscoll's passion for God, people, theology, culture, music, art, and yes, beer, make him one of the coolest people I've never met."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.........,There are much better books out there on the exact same topic. This one was rather boring.
5,Absolutely essential historical reference,"This book is quite simply the best book on the 16th & 17th century witchhunts that I have ever read. Well researched and easy to read (no plowing through dry academic treatises here!) it is one of the few books (besides Leonard Shlain's The Alphabet vs. the Goddess) to link the witch persecutions with the decline in status of women in the 17th century and the decrease of women's contributions to society. Also, many of Barstow's points regarding the scapegoating of poor women are all too relevant to 1990's society (witness ""welfare mom bashing"".) A must read not only because of the subject matter but because it is well written."
3,Good for a laugh,"Old fashioned slap stick comedy, doesn't always work but often does. It is worth watching just to view the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso who saves this one too."
3,"Help Yourself, read Dave Pelzer's other books instead","With best intentions, Mr. Pelzer has written a self-help book. However, most of the advice doled out is really anything your mom or dad or teachers could have and probably did tell you over the years. Believe in yourself and Motivation comes from within are old addages that are key to this novel's advice. Drawing from his own childhood experiences of abuse, the author shows how you can overcome any obstacle to become a happy human being. The book is good, but its lessons aren't anything I haven't read or heard before. What is inspiring are the author's other 3 books. A Child Called It, The Lost Boy and a Man Named Dave. This trilogy of novels is gut-wrenching and inspiring at the same time. I admire Mr. Pelzer's will to achieve and to help others & those books and his personal appearances are where his strengths lie. Not in the self-help, Help Yourself."
1,Not Happy,"The router bit does not come with this item. I tried twice. The return process was good, however, the outcome was the same. I gave up and went to the store and bought the bit. So if you purchace this item make sure you purchase a router bit."
2,action packed,"this book is not well written and I just could not get into it as a result, I believe I would have enjoyed otherwise"
4,Dance to the music,"I first heard the music from this musical at my mother's house when I was just a kid and thought it was for dancing lessons or something. But recently while rumaging around the attic I found this music, and others, put them on and realised what I was missing out on all those years ago. The musical itself is a tad weak, the lyrics are a bit humdrum...but the music is sensational. With just one playing I was dancing around the floor, the beat seems to fill you and you must dance. Although as a musical it may be average but the music, for me, saves it...I could dance all night to this music!"
3,Not Bad,"So when I ordered this CD i didnt expect much from it. Its older, and about ballroom dancing. But the music is quite soothing, and not at all ""old."" The show is sweet and intamite with lots of duets. But the star voice is definitly Lynn Roberts. Wow has she got a sweet smooth voice. So in short, this is one for amature collectors, and up. Probably not the best for someone who likes Wicked, but thats the only show they know. Favorite Song: ""I've Been Waiting All My Life"""
2,"Don't buy this watch for its ""alarm""...","The alarm function is WORTHLESS!Nice looking watch, however the Alarm is so soft and high- pitched that no one in my family could even hear it until I took it into a quiet room. This ""alarm"" is worthless in any normal setting with background noise."
3,Part missing,"The bell is quite sturdy, as advertised. However, the mounting bracket was not attached to the bell or included with the other parts. Rather than go through the return/replace hassle I am making one at home. We are installing the bell up front on our hybrid Toyota. People keep stepping in front of us in parking lots and other places because they don't look and they can't hear the electric motor. A backup alarm is installed for the same reason."
5,Just gets better and better,"I got hooked on this band after hearing their song ""Dry The Rain"" on the High Fidelity soundtrack, and I certainly haven't been disappointed after hearing some of their other material. I now own all of their albums, including this one. The true beauty of this band is that no two songs of theirs sound the same. The Beta Band are one of the most unique and innovative bands I have ever had the pleasure of listening to, and I recommend this album (or any of their others), highly."
2,Totally Mediocre,"This album is simply a complete letdown.It doesn't have any kind of lasting power that THREE EPS or BETA BAND or even HOT SHOTS II and KING BISCUIT TIME do. I listened to it 7 or 8 times through, got bored, and haven't listened since. Now, I love the Beta Band. I think they are awesome and brilliant and talented and so good at that trippy, spaced-out layering sound, but it's just NOT here on this album. HEROES TO ZEROS sounds like it could have been made by any NYC band around these days....totally UNunique."
2,Really Disappointing,"I think maybe the Beta Band is simply a spent force. This CD has so much filler and weak music that it is not worth the price. I was glad to hear they reined in their more ""experimental,"" trippy stuff, as I found their 2nd CD to be almost unlistenable. But I was disappointed to hear the dribble they came up with. Only 2 good (B+) songs on the whole CD-- a pretty low ratio, if you ask me."
2,Zero to slightly above average,"2 1/2Experimental indie pop band has a little trouble reconciling its dual sides, often serving up mushed, ill-developed combinations instead. However, with the (relatively) wide range of production and a few standout tracks, the disc becomes an intriguing mistake instead of complete throwaway material."
2,Sweet story but too long and plot not balanced,"Sweet story about helping others in their time of need, and I love the old-timey feel of the illustrations. I just wish the text could have been tightened up. Aside from it being too wordy, I also felt like it took too long to get to the meat of the story, then the ending felt rushed."
5,Blast from the Past,"I bought toa iruni for my self with spare allowence money and it was worth everything it cost. All I see in the way of negatives are 1, the spinneres and rip cord always seem to get lostand never found. 2, i personoly am geting board with the toa metru desinge. Enouge abuot cons and on to pros. 1 Iruni is extreamly flexibal as all toa are. The golden chronicle staff on the tip allown makes it worth the measly $9.00 it costs."
5,Perfect for its purpose!,"I bought this little guy so I can make a mess in my mothers cupboard at work. I pulled some of her snacks out of her little box, stuffed some christmas decorations in it, knocked some stuff over, and put this guy in there. She thought it was pretty funny and now has it sitting on her computer monitor at work.No complaints."
3,really smelly,"Got this fast, but has a strong rubber smell, maybe because it's new. Not worried enough to return, glad i got the yellow one just in case someone see me in my house practiceing quick draw, and calls the cops. lol"
5,I'm Addicted,"I saw Munly in concert with Slim Cessna's Auto club and picked this CD up from Munly himself at the show. First off, Munly has a presence, for sure. He completely looks and speaks the sound of his music. He was incredible on stage. This album did not disappoint. If you aren't familiar with the Denver sound, you need to give it a listen, it's unlike anything I've ever heard and I can't get enough of it. Needless to say, after purchasing this album I have purchased 2 more of Munly's albums and all of the SCAC's albums and wish there were more. Jimmy Carter Syndrome is a perfect album in my opinion and show that Munly knows a thing or two about how to put together not only an amazing song, but a kick ass album."
4,Excellent Beginner's Primer,"I found this little book handy and very useful, especially some of the references, the author uses. It begins with a basic overview of the realities of astronomical phenomena and moves on to more specific calendarical issues as the book progresses. The author moves methodically from more simple information, adding information and complexity as the book continues. Overall I felt it an excellent primer to begin my calendrical research. However, it is simplistic in places, and its use only applies to calculating the calendar on a simple level. The diagrams are hand-drawn and are sometimes unclear."
4,Worth the wait but goes too fast,It's a shame that a complex story can't continue to pour out of the bookstore like a weekly serial. When the Devil Dances continues the great series of the Posleen Invasion. (I recommend reading Gust Front first. That book is really a keeper). This is a bridging book in that the author admits that due to the distractions of 9/11 and his subsequent fame as a Fox and NY Times correspondent he simply couldn't get it(this book) to where he personally wanted to end. But character empathy will tie you to this one.
3,Plot Missing in Action,"When the Devil Dances did little to advance the plot of Ringo's Posleen War series and instead took the reader through a number of battles as seen through the perspectives of various characters. The book had all of the action of the series' first two books but little of the plot development.Certainly, the action was well-written and Ringo was, as usual, precise and entertaining in his description of all things military. Ringo's usual strengths kept me reading the book until the end but it was, compared to the first two books, something of a disappointment.I'll continue to read the Posleen War books because of the engaging overall plot and Ringo's writing talents but I hope that they resemble A Hymn Before Battle more than they resemble this third entry in the series."
1,Shafting the Reader,"I understand the need to keep readers involved so they'll buy the sequels. I'm quite willing to play that game, just continue giving me interesting characters in interesting situations, and I'll keep buying. But this book cheats. It meanders along for almost 700 pages with what are basically a bunch of subplots, some of which are fairly boring. The series' main character barely appears. A climactic battle is elaborately set up--and then the book ends before it happens. Ringo capped off the two previous books in the series with terrific, extended battle scenes. Here, he might as well have written on the last page: ""HA HA HA, I sure fooled YOU! Get your money ready for the sequel!"" Sorry John, I don't like being shafted and I'll be spending my money elsewhere."
5,This CD is the best Freakin' CD!!!,"This CD is the best complimation of Grunge and Hardcore. With the beggining of such bands as Overcome, and NIV, this CD really rocks. Also, with Bloodshed on this joint, this is one that will be around for a long time. Tooth and Nail really out did themselves this time with this CD. This is my favorite complimation CD T&N has put out."
1,A sleeper,"For those wanting to find stories of warriors this one has very few in it. Tucker can't help including every mundane detail about the soldiers he encounters as they are in camp or standing around, but has very litle to say about combat. Some of the dialogues he includes verbatim (esp. those of three Ohio reservists) read like an Ayn Rand novel--monotonous! The book has no rhyme or reason, and his insistance on giving every soldier he meets a nickname is uncalled for, confusing, and should have been edited out."
3,Maybe I wasn't reading the same book,"...but after reading ""Thunder Run"" (and several others), I found his style to be more a part of the book than the story. His way of talking is ascribed to all speakers in the book. I doubt seriously that our soldiers spoke the way he writes. Small complaint, true. But when you put words in quotes, especially in a historical book, the words should match the speakers.Not only that, but his rather skewed viewpoint comes through in near every paragraph. Just a bit irritating, at least to me. Again, maybe because of the previous books I recently read, maybe not.On the other hand, his insight into the everyday life of Iraqis did make for a more balanced approach than the others. It's just that 'style' of his that bugs me.I'm not saying don't read it, but if you're looking for an unfiltered read on the war, don't go here."
2,broken after 3 months of use,"Well, at first the product seemed to work great. Then, it turns out that the little brackets that connect the transmitter to the outlet are not very stable. Within 3 months of not so excessive use, my transmitter is broken, the brackets swinging in the wind. I love the idea of this transmitter, I just wish it was sturdier."
1,not worth it,"from the day i bought this it never worked well. at first i had trouble keeping a good connection in the cigarette adaptor, so i hard wired it into my car under the dash, but even with a good connection, there was always a lot of static on the radio, so i extended its internal antenna so that it was only a few inches away from the car antenna, while some of the static went away, it still did not transmit clearly. the music sounded fine, except for all the static in the background. overall i am very disappointed with this transmitters performance, but its looks and simplicity are nice."
1,Be Forewarned!!,"This book may appear to be a legitimate piece of journalism, especially with the rave reviews. But be forewarned that it is really a loopy, crackpot polemic that blames America and the Jews for September 11th. Do not buy it and do it read it."
5,War on Freedom the best book I've ever read.,"This book belongs in every school and home in America! It is a well referenced look at the ""mistakes"" that were made before and during 9-11. I can't begin to expain how important it is to read this book! It will change the way you view 9-11 and reveal how it was possible to occur. This book is like ""Farenheit 9-11"" uncensored!!! It is not about conspiracy theory but it really makes you wonder when you put all the pieces of the puzzle together! Please read this book and open your mind so that we may never have a 9-11 again."
4,there is a learning curve,"the negative is that there just isn't an instructional video that shows techniques...there is a learning curve you have to go through...it is NOT as easy as it made to look on TV...the only other negative is that there is no way to store the power cord...the positive is that I am improving and getting better results in a shorter amount of time...it's taken patience...bottom line, it's a thumbs up...I like the results I'm getting now and it is easy, once you learn how..."
4,Steamer,"The steamer takes a bit of getting used to, but it works well for all the shirts I had to do. It's easy to put together and steam comes out quickly and consistently. The only problem I ran into were the hard wrinkles that took 2-3 passes. But it beats a steam iron."
3,"Good steamer, but broke down after two years","I bought this steamer in August 2005, and I swore I would never iron again. I used it 2-3 times a week, and it was fantastic. The only problem I had was that it would occasionally get clogged with mineral deposits which would come out onto the clothes, but using distilled water helped solve that problem.But a month ago, the heating element in the main unit stopped working. Top Innovations said they could send a new unit, but the cost of that was only a little less than buying a whole new steamer. I've noticed that most clothing stores use steamers made by Jiffy, which is where my next steamer will be coming from.UPDATE JANUARY 2011: I've been using theJiffy Steamer J-2000 Residential Series 1300-Watt Garment Steamerever since I wrote the initial review, and it has been really terrific -- even better than my old SteamFast. And it hasn't broken down! I'd recommend the Jiffy over this one."
3,useful but not durable,"The size and functionality of this bag is great: zip on the backpack to the suitcase and it still counts as one carry-on (except in Japan--for some reason the Tokyo airport required that it count as two bags). The backpack straps on the suitcase make it even more versatile for travel. But I've had this for just over a year and the backpack is already coming apart at the seams where it zips at the top. If it were more durable, this would be a five star rating."
1,I want my money back,I took this bag on an international trip the first time I used it. I am sitting in the airport looking at the seam which has ripped out and I still have another flight until I get home. It also falls forward when I put my laptop in the zip-off backpack. I spent $80.00 on this piece of trash. Oh - and It doesn't fit in the overheads in smaller aircraft unless you unzip the backpack. Then you have 2 pieces of carry-on which is the limit.
5,Excellent travelling bag,"I'm a business traveller, on the road almost every week, and I use this as my carry on. Because I'm a bit of a gadget geek, 99% of the time it just has electronic components, and a set of emergency clothes. Additionally, as an IT consultant and trainer, I often travel with more than one laptop. I use the main compartment to carry both laptops and accessories (using padded neoprene bags to protect the laptops themselves) and the day bag for a portable DVD player, snacks, magazines/newspapers and other sundries. I rarely have to check the main bag (and usually its a gate check on smaller aircraft), which fits fine in most overhead bins. The day bag goes under the seat in front of me for easy access to the DVD player, magazines, etc.All-in-all this is a great bag, and when it falls apart, I will probably replace it with the same make and model (assuming they still make it!)"
2,Uncomfortable for Small Frames,"I ordered this backpack because of all the great reviews I read on Amazon, but I was very disappointed. The pack looked great, and had lots of compartments.Unfortunately, when I unzipped the day pack to try it on, I found it extremely uncomfortable. The shoulder straps rested on my neck, and if I walked, they rubbed against my skin. I am a small-framed person, so it may have been due to this. I ended up sending the pack back the following day."
5,Open your mind to receive by Catherine Ponder,I received this book in top condition and I am thoroughly enjoying it. I have read other Catherine Ponder books and truly believe in her philosophy.
1,Men STOP do not read this book,"It will put you off relationships and I hope women are not this selfish and pathetic.26 upper middle class women fantasize about being victims would be a more accurate cover note. I guess it is a writers talent to make ""emcee birthday parties"" sound like a daily chore. I'm sure that some women in this world are ready share their lives and not see life as a competition in their relationships.Love is used often yet not one writer defined her definition of love.The book contains many poor excuses for being a bitch so at least the title is accurate. I'm glad I don't live in NY.The book is about anger. I felt anger reading the book so unless you are addicted to this emotion like many of the writers do not waste your life here."
2,Uhhh....can I have my money back?,"I apologize in advance that this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but all I can say is ""Can I have my money back?"""
2,Jarhear Letdown,Jarhead started out good and showed how the troops went through training with the mental and physical struggles both during training and in Desert Shield and Desert Storm.The letdown was that there was absolutely NO fighting!They had a great buildup to a big fall.
3,Watch the deleted scenes,"I was not impressed with this movie at the theaters, but that was probably because the previews looked really good. I watched Jarhead again on DVD and thought it was much better with the deleted scenes. Some of them really give you a better understanding of the complexity of the characters and where there are coming from."
2,"""The Suck,"" the movie","In the book that gave rise to this film, one of Anthony Swofford's Marine buddies refers to the Corps as ""the Suck."" That pretty much captures the author's love-hate relationship to the Marines. And ""suck"" is what I think about this adaptation of Swoff's fine memoir.Jarhead the book is a cerebral exercise that dissects the hilarious, pointless and terrifying experience of joining, training for and being a warrior in the US Marine Corps during the first Gulf War. Jarhead the film extracts the small amount of action in the book (except, sadly, for the prodigious bouts of drinking and screwing) and plops them onto the screen, drained of humor, emotion, irony or context. No comparison to the power of the book."
2,just ok,"i thought this was a good move for Jamie foxx after his roles in 2004,but the film is all over the place. Jake Gyllenhaal does a decent job in this film,but this film feels like a Music video in spots&just takes on so many cliches of service life&War without having a real central zone. the film felt long&just didn't really move me in the end. there was a great story wanting to come out,but this film was nowhere in that neighborhood to me."
2,rent this or don't watch it at all,"This is a waste of money. It is boring and has nooooooooo action whatsoever. The only action parts are in the beginning when he is in basic training.It is very realistic of the war though. Both my parents were veterans of the gulf war and they said it was right on the money in terms of how it was out there. The only people I would recommend this movie to are people into war movies but not into all the guns, explosions, and gore."
3,one confused fellow,"This movie is not Mash, Catch 22 or All Quiet on the Western Front.They say every generation has a war: here a marine and his fellows in Desert Storm feel cheatedfor not getting to kill any Iraqi soldiers.The current generation might complain about getting too muchkilling of Iraqis?The idea that you want your soldiers desiring to fightis probably important, but I found the scenes wherethe marines were thirsty for blood kind of hard.Somewhere between WWI and now, we have lostsomething important?I think we need the draft back,because these marines don't seem to represent Americaand how that country feels about killing."
3,Typical war movie,"Well, this to me is definitely a guy's movie! It did have some very good moments and it gave me a sense of what it must have been like for the soldiers during Desert Storm. Surprisingly, the time went by fast while I was watching this movie so that tells me that I got into it. Yet I feel that I will not be able to remember much of this. Maybe for me this was a typical well made war movie. Something I liked while watching but doesn't stay reach me down deep.Well, one scene I might remember is when a Vietnam Vet came on the bus with the soldiers during a ""welcome home"" parade. He wanted to shake their hands. Since the soldiers of that war didn't get cheered when they came back to the America I think he was glad they did. I also think at a subconsciouses level wanted a little vicarious pleasure out of their victorious return."
2,a movie leaves some questions,"I didn't read the book, just watch the DVD, and it leaves some questions:do the Marines Crops live in the bay, even the permament party?does Fergus listen to their leader or follow the common sense??? he made open flame on the Humvee which has boxes of ammo!!!one of the supporting character, Alan Troy (Swoff's battle buddy), nobody knows why he diesI don't know did Fowler ever go to cultral awareness class? he stared at an Arab lady and make funny face, this is rude against Arabswhen the group of 6 marched on the desert, the Arab guy told their camels got shot, but they look OK through the screenthis movie sounds degrading Marine Crops, the Kuwait scene is FALSE (currently I am here for OIF), don't ever think every desert is the same, wrong!personally I don't recommend the movie, except you're Jake Gylanhaal fans"
2,A Full-metal jacket wannabe,"This movie is a pale imitation of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, updated to the first Gulf War. It is worth seeing together with Kubrick's great film just to contrast the imitative mediocre with the excellent."
2,boring and never needed to be made,"first and foremost, this is basically exactly what being deployed is like. that being said...NO ONE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT BEING DEPLOYED IS LIKE!!!!! it's boring, depressing, and not very interesting. any insight that might be made in your life is just internalized and rarely expressed with anyone, and once you get home you realize that you're probably just going slightly crazy. the monotony of if all is terrible and i wouldn't wish it upon anyone. so why in the world would anyone make a movie about it?the acting is good and i could, maybe, understand why someone that's been in (or has been in) the military would watch it. it is definitely relatable if you've been in that situation.NOTE: if you're on deployment i wouldn't watch this. the ""dear john"" scene will get you way more paranoid that you probably already are."
2,another a war movie,"In my opinion the message of the film brigs notting new on the subjet, any war as no resenable meaning, a war is a war. It's not all bad in this movie there are some good scenes but now a day i think that every one knows the reasons behind Irak's war. I only recomend this film if you would like to see once more (Apocalipse Now, Platoon)the psycological effects of war in the soldiers and civilians or if you like war films."
3,Good movie but could have been better.,"I'll get right to it.The good?Great acting, pacing, score, cinematography.The movie was fun to watch and I honestly don't think I've heard the ""F"" word uttered this many times since Rob Zombie's Halloween movies.The bad?Kind of like The Hurt Locker I have a hard time believing that our troops really act like this in real life.Why does Hollywood insist on vilifying our troops?If you (Hollywood) have a problem with our involvement in the Middle East then please take it up with our politicians.Do I recommend Jarhead?......not really.If your looking for a movie that's just a tad more realistic than Hurt Locker than sure, rent it.Otherwise I'd rather watch a documentary any day over this."
5,Superb resource for high school Journalism teachers,"I was handed Harrower's book when I took over as Journalism advisor at a San Francisco high school four years ago. It has been one of the best texts I've ever used. Its clear organization, excellent examples, and basic principles make it easy to use, both for me and for my students. I don't really teach from it; I just hand it to my student editors each year and let them learn from its examples. I notice that our paper always looks better after they do."
4,Very helpful in the classroom,I have taken this book apart and used it in the classroom. I bought it used and didn't receive a CD-ROM with it. My students are able to glean many ideas from it for our school newspaper.
4,Very useful,I had wanted to go to his seminar- but ended up buyig the book instead which seems to cover everything. it really has improved my newspaper writing and has me thinking of layouts and the reader BEFORE I start. I know our paper has won 30+ awards from KIPA and KPA in the last 18 months and have used the book for the whole time. So it really does help and is easy to use! Visually stunning!
2,Picture for product is WRONG!!!!!,"If you plan on buying theHOMAK HS10036683 10-by-3-1/2-by-7-1/2-Inch Electronic Access Pistol Box, look at the picture for theHOMAK HS10036684 10-by-5-1/2-by-7-1/2-Inch Electronic Access Pistol Boby. That's the real picture for it. The pictures for the two products need to be switched.We ordered this product based on the picture (thinking the short and deep one would be better than the tall, shallow one, but we ended up getting the tall shallow one)"
1,Warning,"I ordered this safe. I got the box and instructions for what I ordered but the safe itself 10x7.5 and the height is a slope from 2 to 3 1/3"". this is not what I had wanted. The box says satisfaction quarenteed. My satisfaction would be getting what I ordered not something else in the right box and it is most definitely not having to send it back to get some money back, I bought this online to save time not money. HOMAK has lost all of my confidence."
1,Was fine for a few month but ended with a big problem.,"I had this safe for a few months, everything was fine until one day I was punching in the combination and smoke came out of the box and it stayed closed, I tried to use the battery on the external contacts but safe still didn't open. This safe has no key, to bypass an electronic lock, for such an emergency so I spend quite some time opening it and getting my stuff out of it, after I was done only thing I could do its to throw it out."
4,Difficult at first,I purchased this product for storage of my Glock 23. I had trouble reprogramming it for my own code. Once I figured that out it's been smooth sailing every since. It seems nice ands sturdy and it's easy to hide or mount.
3,Too Thin & Small,This safe is really too thin to hold my Glock 21 properly. The dimensions are outside dimensions and there is very little usable space on the inside.
2,Very small interior,"Since the keyboard intrudes into the interior space, the dimensions do not reflect usable space (there was no room for my .38 special).The 9 volt battery external contacts in case of battery failure is a good idea, but when the keyboard malfunctions one day, be it a year or ten years, there will be no way to open the safe short of a pry bar or saw."
1,Okay for starters,"I have to say I'm in agreement with the reviews down below. I'd seen Mod Fun and they were okay, but way too Jam-derivative. I saw Chris Collins' other band, The Punch Line, twice and they truly were something special. For a local band, they had star quality written all over them. How typical is it that a really awesome band didn't make it? If they're back, DON'T MISS THEM! Whatever they do--live or on record, I'm there. This CD is a reminder of that time."
3,Repackaged figures,"These are just repackaged versions of the 1996 Jawa figures. They're not bad, but there are much better ones out there now. Hasbro basically put a joint right at their waistlines so they could sit. However, this makes the figures look pretty silly. Plus, since when do Jawas need to sit?"
3,A little too basic,"Even though I am new to bead stringing, I found this book to be a little too basic. The projects are very easy, but I had already figured out how to make similar things on my own. I would recommend this only if you feel like you know nothing about bead stringing."
2,No depth,"This new album from Janes Addiction seriously lacks the depth from Janes Addiction Live, Nothing Shocking, and Ritual. But I guess you can't blame them since they have cleaned up from the drugs. Honestly, they used to make such better music when they were under the influence. I think it's safe to say that the old Janes is gone and this is what we are left with. It's funny, the more I listen to ""strays"" the more I want to pop in the older janes albums. I was dead wrong when I initially thought it got better with repeated listenings. It really doesn't. I just caught a couple of good sound moments here and there and then realized, this doesn't even come close to the depth and sound of the old Janes. If you are big janes addiction fan, you will probably be disappointed as I was. There are, however, a couple decent songs and that hint back to their trademark sound. It just doesn't hold up to my expectations of what a Janes Addiction album should be."
2,Janes Addiction or Bust???,"I tried; I really really tried to get into this album. After much anticipation I flew out the door to buy this new CD hoping it would deliver, sadly it does not. When I talk about delivering it is coming from an early Jane's fan. My first concert was at 15 and when I heard Ocean Song, and Ted Just Admit It I thought I saw God. I am not trying to relive the past with the CD, sadly I think Jane's Addiction is. I was hoping for a new revolution, but it wasn't much different from the trying to be indie rock I hear on the local radio station. I will give it a few more listens before I shelve this CD; although I think I have already done that, I guess I don't want to fully give up on a band that had near life changing meaning for me. For the newly acquainted Jane's fan, please don't hold it against them for the die hards well..... keep hoping for the revolution."
4,amazing classic janes,this album is as good as any they have done. album comes highly recommeded.... run out and buy it.
5,Jane's Addiction finally hit their peak!,"This CD is awesome. I love Dave Navarro's guitar playing and the vocals are cool too. This is easily the best album these guys have ever released. The songs are balanced, well-written, and hooky. The production is outstanding. I love the huge guitar and drum sound they have finally achieved. Dave's overdubbed guitar parts add so much body to these songs. I also loved the sound he got with the Chili Peppers as well. It's a real shame that Jane's Addiction fans have not embraced this album as much as previous efforts. I guess the music is too polished and catchy for long-time fans."
4,Very Welcome Surprise,"I came across this album by ""accident"" (didn't realize they had a release on the horizon at all) and couldn't have been more pleased by it. As a long time JA fan, I've missed the magic that the band creates. Perry Ferrell sounds great- and the music is incredible. It's one to crank up in the car and drive long distances to listen to over and over.Each song transitions into the next. And while a lot of it doesn't follow traditional JA style, it's a true graduation into the next realm of JA. So glad to see them back- and so disappointed that I missed Lolapalooza this year!"
5,The Best Comeback Album of All Time?,"Only time will tell if this is the best comeback album ever but what a return! Top songs for me are ""Just Because,"" (the single), ""Strays,"" ""Wrong Girl"" and ""Hypersonic"" but there really isn't a dud on the album. Dave Navarro continues to amaze me with his prowess and Perry Farrell is in perfect form. Can't wait to see them live this summer. If you can find it, there is a special edition release of this album with a DVD full of extras."
3,Instructions for use...,"I payed just over $20 a week ago, from this same seller, and I'm pretty satisfied, so far. Here's the issues with it that I've found:- there are NO instructions for installation. If you are tempted to unscrew the two little bolts in the center, DON'T! It took me a very long time to put them back almost where I found them. Just twist the ends until it's the right length.- doorways larger than 3 feet will leave you off center.- Foam pads, while comfy, are too close, and not adjustable.- Mounting brackets (unless you're brave or dumb and don't want to use them) require three screws on each end. This is a lot of damage to do to your door! If you're like me, and can't use the ones that just hang from the doorframe, look for something a little more user friendly to install.Still, I'm thrilled to have a pull up bar in my apartment, and I haven't hurt myself using this one, yet!"
3,friction pads not enough to support the bar,"I purchased this item after reading reviews saying that the bar can hold weight of an adult using only the friction pads. However that it not true. In fact, it could not hold the weight of my 11yr old (about 80lbs) either. Moreever it needs a really solid door frame as it needs to push on the frame tightly. It is a good product with solid construction but you need to be ready to mount the holding brackets using screws onto your door frame."
5,works great,"I like this product very much, I use it morning and night and can see the difference. It delivers what it says it will. I am finding all the Billy Jealousy products to be great quality and excellent value(try the hits vol.1)"
5,An Awsome Read,"As a member of the EV team at Northamton-East, Caroline Kettlewell made me feel the whole adventure all over again. It was like she took what I saw and felt and put words to it. I am so glad someone told this story, that other people get to read our stugale to the top. If you like to cheer for the underdog you need to read this book. Bryan T Ferguson ""the man who drove to the record"""
5,Couldn't Have Done It Without this Book!,"As a new medical transcriptionist coming from a completely different background, this book has proved to be more valuable to me than almost any other book in my library. If you can only catch part of a phrase or know what the word or phrase is related to, you will, almost always, find what you are looking for! The only other book that would be in my library is the ""sounds like"" book-set up exactly like this one!"
4,Cute and functional for one person,"An American measuring cup holds 8 oz. A **teacup** holds 6 oz. This teapot holds 12 fluid ounces, which is two teacups worth. Now you know. From base to the top of the pot is about 3.5"", not including the lid.I think this is an adorable teapot. It holds just enough water for two tea bags, which is just what I want. If poured slowly and balanced, it does not drip. The color is not neon, but a bright and cheerful green. There is a strainer between the spout and pot to keep your bags out of the spout.The glaze is uneven. It is very thin at the spout connection to the pot, the lip of the spout, and around the top ridge. If you are looking for perfection, move up to a higher price point. For the price, this is a lovely teapot that is what it's advertised."
1,Too Small,"This Teapot is tiny. It will only hold a cup and a half of tea. To be fair, I misread the dimensions before I ordered it. My question is ""who would ever need a tiny teapot?."
5,Double your time with this watch,"Hey, Seiko used to make this watch, but I have not seen one of those in over 15 years now, so I have bought 2 of these over the years. I like the double time zone features on the digital portion of the watch along with the stop watch feature.I love having both a digital watch and the old fashioned hand watch with a sweep second hand. Makes it easy for me to tell time with a quick glance. When I travel it makes a great watch for the nightstand as the hands glow in the dark and it has an alarm feature. I have had two of these for over 10 years and have never replaced a band and they both keep acurate time all the time."
2,Died after 1 year,"This watch died (battery?) one year after I bought it. I like the watch, it fits well and I'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it. But I can't find a place to repair it here on Maui. It has a 3 year warranty but I'd have to mail it in. After the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested. What a hassle..."
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK! ITS MISSING EVERY OTHER PAGE!,"After ordering this book and anxiously awaiting its arrival, I opened up the box and flipped through the pages only to notice that EVERY OTHER PAGE IS MISSING IN THIS BOOK!!! So ,I re-ordered this book, hoping it was a mistake... well... the mistake was mine.... It was the exact same thing! So , I returned and am seriously reconsidering buying a book from amazon.com ever again!! BOO!"
3,Read the Prologue Often,"This book wasn't for me and I sensed it from the beginning, but I struggled through. I might have put it down except for the fine writing and well-crafted story. My drama prof talked about the need for a strong protagonist and antagonist to make a compelling story. This book had neither, and that was the essential problem. It lacked tension. Also, I thought the many island characters made it difficult to follow. It needed family trees and also a map of the island would have helped. But, read the prologue carefully and several times during the reading. That will help get you through."
1,Don&#65533;t waste your time.,"Painful, painful, painful! The slowest book I've ever attempted to read. I made it though the first 150 pages, but only because I was stuck at the DMV."
2,Not easy to install,"Fan instructions did not mention a part that needed putting on until after steps that would have to be reversed to get it into the assembly. Fan is heavy and hard to work with, and directions suggest ancient system of a mounting in wood (are you kidding?)rather than more common fan support boxes. Took lots of effort to balance--what is up with that? Trial-and-error system of observation (which wobble is worse after weighting?--not measurable!) Finally, measuring from ceiling revealed the blades that were best candidates for weighting (installer's idea--not in directions, and wouldn't have worked on angled ceiling.) Next step would have been taking off light fixture and trying blades in different positions--oh, that's efficient! And this was installation with someone whose done dozens of these through the years. Also, wish I'd taken more note of the review mentioning light strobe effect--it's unpleasant."
2,Nice product - but shipping with wrong part,"I bought 5 of these to use in a new home. I've always been happy with Hunter fans. They balance easily, are quiet, and have never failed me. The metal piece on the bottom of the glass has the holes in the wrong place causing the pull chain for the fan to bind. I contacted Hunter by email and sent photos - but never got a response. I corrected the problem by drilling new holes - but you shouldn't have to do that. If you put it on a wall switch and only use one of the 3 speeds then it won't be an issue - but I feel really let down getting such an obvious flaw from a fan that is not cheap."
1,S/W does not work,"This s/w was bundled with my Maxtor 5000 drive. The drive is great, but the Retrospect software does not work, the interaction between the drive and the s/w is flakey at best; the user interface is very difficult to understand. I finally had to de-install the software and use Windows XP Backup with the drive. The company who makes this product would not offer support because by the time I got around to calling them about their failed s/w it had been more than 30 days past the date I bought the Maxtor drive. Maxtor's reponse was, ""Call Retrospect"". In the future, I'll be keeping away from this company for sure."
2,Might as well be written in Greek,"I agree with the reviewer from Charlottesville that ""the prompts and messages seem to be written by someone for whom english is a very second or third language"", and the PDF file documentation is no better. I find it extremely irritating that simple step by step flow charts for executing the various back-up features are not used. Come on Retrospect,how about some straitforward explantions on using this program. And please, take some lessons from the people who wrote the documentation for the Tech Tool ProUtility program -now they know how to write documentation inclearly defined steps."
1,In Retrospect - Avoid This Product,"This program is not intuitive. The Retrospect engineers invented a secret language with terms nobody understands. For graphic arts - you are better off buying large capacity external hard drives and not archiving your files. Even if you can figure out how to use this program, why risk the damage of ""Retrospecting"" your files? In the past, I've had two hard drives fail, and both times I have a feeling it was caused by Retrospect throwing data all over the place that was irretrievable."
1,Who Is To Blame?,I bought two sets of these shelves and managed to make one set out of both boxes. The shelves are not protected in any way when shipped and they were apparently walked on by every person in UPS prior to making their way to me. The materials were bent so badly that I spent the better part of an evening bending them back into a somewhat usable shape. The material that was bent too badly ended up in the trash...cause that's how I like to spend my money! Buy something in town or you will be stuck with crumpled metal crap once it arrives at your door.
3,"good sound, but uncomfortable","I don't think you can beat their sound and isolation for the price, but I find these headphones quite uncomfortable. The cans are small, and while I have a relatively small (female) head and smallish ears, they don't cover my ears completely, pressing on the tops of my ears and squeezing my head."
5,basically perfect,"like a said in the title these headphones are great! i'm a great fan of metal and i always find CD's ranging from Rush to Judas priest in my CD player. those ear piece headphones are really annoying cuz they slip out of ur ear when ur moving. these however are always stable and barely move. I know this because i always thrash and bang my head. i originally found these at borders and they looked cool and they were cheap so i bought them. i was shocked at home when i found that these headphones were pretty heavy in bass. i don't mind that actually. i found it much better than ear phones! they need a bit getting used to at first but otherwise its great! the sound comes in perfectly. another thing is that i somehow end up accidently pulling on the wire thing but it always stays put. i was afraid that the wires in the headphones would break but they never do.so overall what i'm trying to say it that these headphones are great because they are comfortable, durable, and cheap."
4,Great for Beginners,"I am new to exercising and I found this one to be easy enough to actually stick to. However, it's very repetitous.My favorite is still Denise Austin's Indoor 2 Mile Walk. I'm so out of shape right now that this is a good ""easing my way back to loyal exerxcising"" with Leslie. Denise's is pretty intense and for the moderate exerciser to give you a good sweat."
5,LIFE CHANGING,"I was very skeptical at first. But i found this book in the bargin bin at my local book store, so i picked it up. I planned to tear it apart.It was an entertaining read,but i didnt believe any of it. One night i awoke in a bright white light with Azna floating above me. She showed me my past lives, i was surprised to find that i had 20 previous past lives. I was chinese my last 10 lives.Azna assigned me a eskimo spirit guide.I was informed by him that sylvia browne is Azna reincarnated into the human form. Only 30% of humans are white spirits, fortunately if you read this book you are a white spirit and will be saved! I love this book, it changed my life. I have become a priest of Azna. May Aznas light shine upon you."
5,This will open up your soul,This book was a great help and anyone who believes in Slyvia's work will truely want to read this book. This book just answered so many questions that I had and it has helped me see where I truly am with God.
5,Beautifully relaxing,This is one of my favourite CDs to listen to when I want to relax. It takes me back to happy moments in my life and the places I find peaceful. Highly recommend this CD to anyone and to all ages.
4,Who's the Bossk?,"Bossk is the Bossk. My son is all about collecting droids and bounty hunters. No storm troopers. No rebels. No cantina aliens or intergalactic musicians or weirdos who hang around at Jabba's Palace. Just droids and bounty hunters. So he asks me who my favorite bounty hunter is. I'm not gonna be a typical geek and say ""Boba Fett"". No. I gotta be a smartass and say ""Bossk"". He says, ""Well, get me your favorite bounty hunter for my birthday."" OK. No probs. Except that Bossk is out of production. Hasbro isn't making Bossk in any of the current lineup. So I finally found one for sale. The up shot is I got it for a third of the price of a new figure. The downside is he isn't as articulated as the newer ones, but the boy was happy, so whatever."
4,When the past will not let us rest.,"Sebold had been writing The Lovely Bones that begins with the rape and murder of a young girl, when she found she had to stop and write this book. She had been raped , and ""lucky"" to have survived it. In the reactions of her family, law enforcement, and the rapist himself, Sebold found the lack that she needed to survive the attack in her heart as well. The writing is honest and without an attempt to justify herself. Well worth reading."
5,LUCKY,What a chilling tale! She does such a GREAT job making you see what she's going through and feel what she is feeling...This was hard to put down!
4,"I liked it, but probably won't read it again","I admire that Alice Sebold wrote this book. I didn't know anything about it before I read it, and there were parts that made me feel sick to my stomach because of the intensity of her descriptions. She is a fantastic writer. I thought it sort of fizzled out before it ended, though, and I probably won't read it again."
4,A must read....,Alice Sebold wrote a very powerful memoir. I did at times find myself skimming pages to get on wtih the story. I found the ending to be a little disappointing though. I think Alice fell short at the end. It is almost as if she was tired of writing and just ended it. I would have like to have heard a little more about how her drug habit started and more on her life up to the point of writing her memoire. I do hope that Alice comes out with another book. I have shared this and The Lovely Bones with friends and family.
4,Emotionally Involved,I was so emotionally involved with this book; I read it in 2 days. Sebold writes in a way that makes you feel you are the main character. When she was running; I felt out of breath. When she was crying; I wept. When she spoke of her parents; I saw my mom standing there. This book was probably the best I have ever read. I thought it would be too disturbing for me; but instead it opened my eyes to the trials others face in life. MUST READ
5,Lucky reader,Alice Sebold tells the account of her rape and more importantly everything afterwards. One can really appreciate the entire affect of rape on not only the victim but everyone in the victim's life.
2,Blah,"I don't recommend this book to anyone who enjoys prose or literature. Sebold's use of a stripped down, matter-of-fact tone desensitizes her story. Though her rape was a traumatic event, I couldn't feel for her. Perhaps it was her intent not to draw out feeling to avoid pity but personally, I think it was uneffective in conveying her complete story because a memoir needs an emotional plot as well.I wanted to put down this book before I was even half way though there were still many unfinished subplots like the conviction of her rapist.I would expect this book in the children's/ preteen section if it weren't for the detailed account of the rape."
5,"Innocence interrupted: stark, straightforward story of a sexual assault","At age 18, Alice Sebold, an innocent (in every sense of the word) college student was brutally raped while crossing campus one night. She starts her story by recounting the event in graphic detail, and continues the tale in the same frank fashion. Nearly as shocking as the opening chapter are the reactions and actions of certain members of the police force, her family, and fellow students. That she was able to keep a level head, in spite of what she went through, in her attempts to obtain justice is a testament to her mature mental state. Ms. Sebold story, told with frank forthrightness, shines a shockingly bright light on scary situation. Equally interesting: Even Silence Has an End by Ingrid Betancourt, I Am the Central Park Jogger by Trisha Meili, and The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold."
1,"BLAH, BLAH .....BORING","This is my second Alice Sebold book and it is my last. This book was so drawn out and pathetic. She made the bad thing that happen to her effect her entire life. Move on, a terrible thing happened to you ok we get it. I think there was a total lack of subject matter, blah, blah, blah so, what else and then there was nothing. A true disappointment after Lovely Bones. Alice please go back to your previous style of writing and leave the single tragedies to someone that can expand their knowledge."
5,Only The Strong Survive,"Pertaining to the novel, ""Lucky,"" a young, eighteen year old college freshman was brutally raped and beaten in a park off campus late on night. This novel truly stounded me! Alice's ability to recover from her tragic experience and keep going with her life. Alice's ability to rebuild and construct her life was absolutely remarkable. Of course, Alice did recieve a little help from her friend Tricia at The Rape Crisis Center, and her lawyer Gail, whom was sort of like Alice's role model. I believe in order for Alice to go on she must first find a place inside of herself to shine again. Alice accomplishes this horrific feat by facing her fears and reliving that dismal night of shame. Overall, I believe Alice grows and prospers with every step she takes to eventually put her rape behind her. In the end all of Alice's hard work and will pays off when she can finally sleep at night knowing that she has sought justice and is finally at peace with herself."
3,A good story about one girls journey,I thought it was a good read- with an interesting twist at the end. The writers conveys what it feels like to deal with a tough topic that makes everyone once close to her become removed from her experience and how she manages to find peace within herself to survive through her experience and continue with her life.
3,Lucky,"I enjoyed reading Lucky, I found it very interesting to see what Alice had to go through after the rape and how brave it had made her.I thought the first couple chapters were really interesting,and I wanted to keep reading. As the novel continued it seemed like everything was drawn out, and I could predict what was going to happen next.Overall I enjoyed the novel, but I wouldn't want to read it again."
3,Ambivalent,"I'm really ambivalent about this book.On the one hand, I understand the impulse & need to write through & past such an enormously life-changing experience. On the other hand, I found myself skimming my way through chunks of the book about two-thirds of the way through because it just started to get disjointed & flat & jarring in some way that I just couldn't bear to read.The first 100 or so pages are excellent, especially if you can get past the first chapter - an excruciatingly detailed explanation of what happened to the author. It's ironic that she notes at some point in the book that an essay she wrote for The New York Times Magazine about the experience was quoted in the ""Trauma"" part of a book on trauma & recovery & this inspired her to figure out more about what she needed to do to move forward - ironic because I think I'd still include her solidly in the trauma category & that makes me very sad for her & angry that this happens so often."
4,"A Lucky Pick, A Great Read!","After reading Lovely Bones, it seemed nearly impossible to have another moving emotional book such as that by the same author, but after reading Lucky I was truly amazed. Lucky begins with the tragic event of rape that Alice Sebold encounters and continues into her struggle afterwards. The detail that Sebold reaches through this novel allows the reader to get somewhat of an understanding of this traumatic experience and difficult journey she began after rape. After reading this book the perspective on society takes a different outlook because Lucky allows the reader to realize how hard society is on people because of what people have heard. Lucky goes further into detail of events that occur after her rape, even with such a difficult subject. Sebold does an amazing job with expressing her emotions and experiences through her long struggle."
5,Lucky to have read Lucky,"Last year my son gave me THE LOVELY BONES for my birthday. I was most impressed with how the author was able to be funny with such a dark subject; brilliant.This year my son gave me LUCKY and I was blown away by the author's ability to move me through the horrific experiences she endured and feel somehow I too had triumphed over trauma in the end.And lastly, I grew up in Syracuse, my father and nephew graduated from S.U. and I bought pizza and a leather purse on Marshall St. I am older than the author and somehow felt guilty that while this was happening to the author I was possibly eating an icecream cone and unaware of her pain.Outstanding!"
3,Strong First Chapter but Started Skipping Pages,"One thing in common with the Lovely Bones is the fact that Sebold has an extremely effective and powerful style of grabbing the reader in the first chapter. Even though I knew what each book was about, I found both Lucky and Lovely Bones riviting in their first chapters. However, unlike Lovely Bones, I found myself skimming pages in Lucky to get to the essence of the story. I gave it 3 stars and was contemplating 4 because I was not only compelled to finish it, but found that it stayed with me enough to discuss it with friends. (one friend also agreed with the skimming technique to try to finish). The book is important because Lovely Bones would probably not have been written but for Sebold getting out this story, which is in itself a very powerful story of survival. Something to talk about. . ."
5,great supplemental workout guide,"Besides USMC recruits, you can really use the book as a supplemental tool to regular cardio and weight training. There are whole sets of routines for warm-up exercises. The workout doesn't require equipment. In case you travel and can't access a gym, it's convenient to do the exercises in a hotel room."
5,Highly Recommended,"Valerie Paradiz has written a very powerful account of her struggle to help her son develop his unique and creative capabilities, to find and build a positive sense of self within the culture of high functioning autism. This book pushes all kinds of envelops, especially our own and our sense of what ""normal"" perception/congition/experience is... Gripping, edge-of-the-seat writing. Loved it and have shared with many friends."
4,works as advertised,It's a very simple gadget but it works. I had no problem using it to press back the calipers when changing my pads.
5,"An Inspiring, Informative Miracle of a Book!","This book is brilliant, an engrossing, well-written and well-informed masterpiece. I'm giving it to ALL my artist and writer friends for Christmas. I never knew any of this stuff! And I majored in Art! It's utterly fascinating, the impact these women had on these great artists! I couldn't put it down. I wish I had 6 stars to give it."
3,Was written in already,"This book was difficult to find at a reasonable price. So, when I found this deal I was excited. It was mentioned that it had some wear to the cover but made no indications that it had been used. I am not opposed to purchasing used books but would have appreciated if there would have been mention that it had been written in in several different places. So, I was a bit disappointed but am satisfied with the book overall."
1,Guitar by the Sea,The CD I received is titled Guitar by the Sea but has none of the listed songs on it. How the heck can that happen??
2,TWENTY YEARS AND THIS IS ALL THEY GET?,"After the Beatles, the Ramones were the most influential rock group of the past 40 years, and they deserve a lot better than this hodgepodge. There's nothing on here that you shouldn't already have, and the hour or so of rarities and B-sides they recorded are nowhere to be found. Why are box sets always so awful? They don't satisfy the true fans and they're too expensive to appeal to anyone else. Start with ALL THAT STUFF VOLUMES 1 and 2, IT'S ALIVE, TOO TOUGH TO DIE and ANIMAL BOY, then get the rest of them in any order you can. Gabba gabba hey."
5,"Ramones, The Best Band Ever","If you are a fan of the Ramones like I am. I would not let this jem get away. Every song on this classic album rocks. The Ramones have never done a bad song. Even their later work is great. Even if you have never even heard any of the Ramones songs, I would pick this album up I am sure you will love it.RIP Joey you are a GOD!!!"
3,nothnig great about this encyclopedia,"The encyclopedia is easy to install and not heavy on the system. The contents are not very exhaustive, and there are not sufficient MM clips as you would expect. Overall an average buy."
3,Worth getting if the price is right,"The videos of ELP, Curved Air (yes, Sonja appears), Family and Focus are excellent-quality vintage performances from 1970-72. The tracks by Caravan, Wakeman and BJH are 1990s performances. The track by Nektar seamlessly blends a 1972 performance with a 2002 one, toggling back and forth, and the visuals from each are in perfect sync with the 2002 audio. Very cool!My biggest complaint is that each video has a long printed script introducing each performance, which crawls along the bottom for up to 30 seconds each time. I guess the purpose is to dissuade anyone from uploading the vid to You Tube, but it sure does look cheap. Why should buyers of this DVD be penalized like this? Still, not a bad little video at a reasonable price."
4,GOOD CD!!!!!!!!!!,"good cd don dokkens great singing,george lynch's awesome guitar playing!!!the only reason i gave it a four star is because unchain the night is not on the cd.IT'S A GOOD CD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Didn't work on my Epi EJ200CE endpin/jack,"This fit on the button behind the neck of my Epiphone EJ200CE, but the hole wasn't big enough to fit over the other strap button, which is an endpin with jack. If your guitar has two regular strap buttons, I guess it would work okay. When I tried to push it over the endpin/jack, the inner disc came apart form the guitar pick-shaped piece. So, yeah, not so great."
1,Fell apart!,"Hard to believe this was so bad. I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. However, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when I tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps."
2,"Hassle-free 10mm ""hole-in-one""","Because it's made of mere plastic, it's suitable for light-duty use only - as evidenced by the other users' experiences here.It works, but shouldn't be considered for use with endpin diameter larger than 10mm anyway. And also don't consider it if your guitar strap's got thick/extra thick ends.However, for US$3.99, it's still not totally useless to me."
4,Jack as Jack...,"Straight from the hip[flask] of Kerouac, a simple tale about the search for his family's history, which means (like every Kerouac novel) it's not REALLY about that at all, but more about life in general. I loved chapter two (which you can read all of through the link, above) because it sums up Kerouac's writing philosophy in an nutshell (a good starting point for anyone diving into his works for the first time). Since we all know booze would kill Kerouac not too long after he wrote this novel, it's tough not to feel sorry for him as you read -- and, at least for me, wish I could go back and smack his drunk ass out of it -- but I guess that's what made him tick. After reading Kerouac's vivid, rambling accounts of the most mundane events, one can't help but to find a greater appreciation for life and everything in it. God bless him."
4,Philadelphia Then and now,"Being from Philadelphia I appreciate pictures of what many my age (86) never knew existed. It would be nice to see more pictures of working class neighborhoods and things like the ""Chinese Wall"" and the RED Light"" district"
4,A beautiful coffee table book about the city of Brotherly Love!,This book is clearly more visual and offers insightful and useful information if you are interested in Philadelphia history which is really also American history. The author does an adequate job in focusing on past and present while offering information without drowing it's reader into it. I would have liked to have read more and seen more.
2,Smells good,"Unfortunately, it did not alleviate my headache at all. There was no sensation to it at all. It did smell good, though."
4,I already knew most of this stuff,BUT I am a crazy internet search engine fool of a guy. If you are new. It packs heat.
3,Good for novices,"I am writing this review because I think that the current reviews are a bit over the top. This book seems to cover the basics well, but at nearly 600 pages I find it overly wordy. The same information could be conveyed in a third of the space. There seems to be an abundance of information online on the topic of SEM but not a lot available in book form, which is probably because things change so quickly that books quickly become redundant. So in short, good for beginners, but more advanced users will probably be better off sticking with webmaster world and other forums and sites."
3,a decent printer for its price,"i recently bought this printer and so far i have had no problems. I have printed full length 8x10 best quality color photos and every time the printer has printer superbly. I did experience a paper jam once, rather incorrect paper feed, i just pulled it out, reinserted it and the printer printed it properly. speeds for a 8x10 better quality color photo on a normal paper is 1ppm. with just text the printer is quite upto spec in printing speed and quality is excellent, no doubts there. catridges are costly though. even with color prints, if you use better quality instead of best, the printer does print quickly. overall i would recommend this printer."
1,Lexmark no longer supports,"this printer for the MAC. No drivers are available if you have Tiger, Leopard, or Snow Leopard. I just got one of these used and it worked fine when I first plugged it in, but when I updated to the latest OS, I discovered that this and dozens of other Lexmark printers would no longer be supported for MAC. And this was AFTER I had purchased new ink cartridges for this printer (Over $50) which are now useless unless I can find some third party workaround."
2,Do Not like this printer,"This is not a good printer. It jams the paper almost every time I try to print. The only way to be sure it will print properly is the stand there and feed only one sheet at a time! If I even put so much as 5 sheets of paper in, it pulls the sheets crooked and proceeds to jam. I have looked into the trouble shooting, and all it says is to make sure you are loading paper correctly and that you use ink jet compatible paper, which I do. The only redeeming quality about this printer is that it does print decent quality color pics, once you get it to stop jamming!"
4,4 1/2 stars,"Miami attorney Nick Rey seems to be on the fast track as far as his career is concerned, when he finds out his father has been kidnapped in South America. Here starts a chain of events that leads Nick on an adventure not soon forgotten. From the jungles of Columbia to the streets of Miami, Mr. Grippando has written another gripping adventure that dares you to finish reading in one sitting. At times emotional and at times humorous, yet always gripping, the author has written a solid story that entertains all the way through. A timely thriller including some ransom for hostage problems in S.A. You'll feel the sweat and chills as you read.Highly recommended for all thriller readers."
4,Great Organic Mascara,"I love this mascara! I have been searching for organic/natural products, and I have tried other organic mascaras. I have had allergic reactions to the other mascaras due to their ingredients, especially the algae related ingredients. Plus, the other organic mascaras that I have tried do not have any hold or provide definition to the lashes. Dr. Hauschka's mascara has soft hold that lasts all day. It is a bit pricey, which is the only negative thing about the product."
3,Not My Cup Of Tea.....3 1/2,"I've had high hopes about this book, the description interest me and I thought it was going to be a really great romantic novel. It is indeed a classic romance but other than it being too long when cutting the pages in half would've been sufficient without having too much information about the comanches and such (got too boring), there was just too much tragedy going on, but hey, I don't mind having a bit of drama in my novels but this was just too much. It is not a keeper for me, I don't think I'll be reading it again after spending three weeks of reading it. It will definitely go back to the library today where it belongs so others may have the opportunity to read it as it is out of print or very hard to find from what I read.Recommendation: anything from Lisa Kleypas"
3,"Yarn use, not structure options","Was hoping for a book that showed many shaping options---different sleeves, necklines, waistlines, edges, etc. Nope---this more concentrated on different yarns and some different stitches---decoration rather than structure. She does a nice job showing how using different yarns can change the look, and talks about making the shirt as flattering as possible, but this was not what I was looking for. If I had been able to ""look"", I would not have bought this---but will be an excellent book for someone interested in the effects of different yarns."
5,It's about time for Time Again,"This is an EXCELLENT CD. What an amazing collaboration between Donald Rubinstein and Bill Frisell. The songs are soulful and cut to the heart - the kind that stay with you long after they've been played. The title song, Time Again, is rich in lyrics, music, and truth, which sets the stage for the wide range of songs you experience on the CD. I highly recommend it."
4,A must read for an intelligent person needing capital,"If you are thinking about or in the process of building or starting a business and have to raise outside funds, this book is for you. The author, Andrew Sherman, assumes he is speaking to an intelligent reader unlike many books I bought on this topic. I just ordered another copy of this book for my father-in-law, who is thinking of expanding his small printing company."
2,There've Been Better,"I watched this show when it was on the air. I don't honestly remember being highly impressed with it, just interested enough in it to keep watching every week.Some have compared this to 'Family Guy' and 'Firefly' but to me there really is no comparison. 'Family Guy' i liked instantly, it was a can't miss after the first episode! Honestly, 'Firefly' took me a bit longer to get into and I really only did right before it got cancelled. But I was SURE after both of those series that I loved them. This one I'm just not as enthused about it.That's why I plan on giving this show another chance. I missed some of the last episodes so I didn't see it all. I plan on renting this when it comes out and reeducate myself on it. If my idea changes I'll be sure to rereview it. But until then I remain not highly impressed."
4,Sharp,"Sharp, works great on 6061 aluminum. Wish it had a hex shank for hand operation. Haven't tried it on ferrous metals."
2,Poor Quality Yet Functional,"I have used this flashlight extensively. Out of the box, the radio wouldn't work unless you pushed the dial in certain direction. But it does work as long as you want to hold the dial. The knob on the charging handle broke off shortly after. When it's dark, more than likely you're going to knock something over eventually. The first time this flashlight fell off a bench, the charging crank broke off completely. I jerry rigged it using an aluminum port cover from the back of an old computer wrapped with duct tape so I could still recharge the flashlight. Last week I pulled it out of a backpack only to find the radio buttons had completely fallen off. The beam is adequate for my purposes, On low - a minute of cranking seems to provide 15 - 25 minutes of light, which I find to be an acceptable ratio. The siren is totally useless. Not loud enough to be taken seriously. The USB charger is woefully under-powered to the point of being useless as well."
4,emergency,this little thing seems to work real well. I bought it because my wife wanted one and was surprised at how well it worked.
4,Great value.,This thing really works. Both the light and the radio function very well. Great price. The fact of not having to install batteries is wonderful and means I can keep it handy without worrying if it will work when I really need it.
5,a perfect Christmas gift,It was purchased for an older lady friend who had heard the music once and never forgot it. She was all smiles as I handed her the surprise gift.
3,"Mary, Did You Know","The words of this song take you to another world, a world of understanding we/you are not at the same level as did the human form of our saviour."
3,Johnny and the Dead,"Terry Pradget writes wonderful character based novels, but somehow this one fell a bit flat. I missed the rich characters that populate Pradgett's other novels. Characters like Granny Weatherwax and Angua, the werewolf police woman are so complex that they seem real. I will try Pradgett again, but Johnny was a disappointment."
2,getting a bit old,"not as good as the first two shows... 2004 and 2007... getting kinda old now needa a new host we have seen enough of Bill Murray. Hope the next one has some different guitar players like maybe Mark Knopfler and Eric Johnson Brad Paisley, and can someone tell Jeff Beck to lift a few weights he has an arm like a 80 year old woman"
3,Hasn't arrived Yet,"Despatched a month ago and still hasn't arrived. There's no options for chasing international freight. If it ever arrives, I'm sure it'd be great."
3,No 3rd DVD Disc in packeage on arrival 3/15/2011,"I received the ""Deluxe 3 DVD Blu-Ray"" set yesterday from Smogtown in California, a firm rated at 99% +/- reputable. The touted 3rd Disc was not in the packeage despite words and advertising to the contrary both by Amazon and in/on the packaging. I am sadly disappointed by this episode as my other purchases through Amazon have been most excellent."
4,Blues Fan,"There are many great performances on display here. Many established artists who appear to have drunken from the fountain of youth. Yet, in the middle of all this talent, is a young musician named Gary Clark, Jr. who only performed one song but was absolutely amazing. His performance of Bright Lights alone is worth seeing. I had not heard of him before and hope to see his talent better recognized in the future. All in all, the whole show is a worthwhile viewing adventure."
2,TERRIBLE CAMERA WORK,"While I appreciate some of the more comprehensive reviews of this DVD, the essential facts are these:1. excellent sound quality2. exceptional, primarily blues performances3. TERRIBLE CAMERA WORK/EDITING - No guitar fan wants to see a shot of the crowd or the back of the drummer's head during a SOLO!In a nutshell, buy it for the sound, not the video."
5,5 star and then some,"Any rating less than a 5 would be written by a whanker who doesn't know shit from shinola!I have looked at this Blu-ray for over two years agonizing at the 24.95 sticker price.Three weeks ago I grimaced a little ,sucked it up and doled out the 24.95.What was I waiting for excellent value with around 39 different players on this lineup.Steve Winwood,Ronnie Wood, Derek Trucks, Robert Cray,Keb Mo, B.B. King, Warren Haynes,Earl Klugh,Buddy Guy, ZZ Top,Doyle Bramhal II, and moreExcellent audio great visuals!Arguably two of the best guitar players on the planet today with John Mayer doing a wonderful rendition of BillWither's ""Ain't no Sunshine""and Smokin Joe Bonamasa playing on ""Goin Down"".There's something for everybody on this offering.A must for any audiophile or music aficionado !"
2,archaic,"First of all, having to ""unplug"" because it froze up is rediculous. It will freeze up to where neither the remote nor front face button commands work. So you have to unplug it.While dubbing from vhs to dvd it periodically stops saying "" cannot duplicate, copy protected"". The funny thing is is that I am dubbing from a home movie vhs tape made from a camcorder.I have only made three of these home made vhs to dvd recordings and the third one will not "" finalize"". I have tried multiple times and it just goes back to its screen saver. The dvd will not play in any other dvd player.I am sorry I bought it."
5,Great selections from a great band,"If you like E,W and F, you will love this CD. Excellent songs from beginning to end. I am very glad I purchased this."
3,OK.,I was a little disappointed with the album. That's because I didn't listen to the songs before I bought.
4,One of the Best!!!,"Simply, one of the best! Where have all the groups like this gone? This CD doesn't have all E, W and F songs, but it DOES have all their greatest and biggest hits! Well worth the price! If you only want one E, W and F CD, this is probably the one to get! We're glad we did! Great CD!"
2,So much more to give.,"After reviewing the selections on this CD,I found myself wandering;""WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THEM?"". I grew up with this group on my stereo and there is so much more of EWF that this compilation is lacking.It's a good collection,but I would venture to try and collect their entire collection before resorting to buying this."
5,If I had it my way...,"This is the best single disc collection of EWF...everybody knows that. Sound quality is impeccable...I can see that a lot of effort went into the remastering. What I was also impressed with was the sequencing of the song selections. This makes listening to the CD that much more enjoyable. Maurice White, you truly were in a class all by yourself and this collection is indeed your gift to us. I like pretty much all the songs here but if I had to put out a 17-song EWF collection, I would have left out ""Can't Hide Love"", ""Gratitude"", ""Mighty Mighty"", and ""Getaway."" In their places, I would have included ""Love's Holliday"", ""System of Survival"", ""Sunday Morning"", and ""Spend The Night."" Anyone disagree? But clearly this is such a minor quibble on my part. The disc really is a gem."
4,Red Oak,"Product was as expected. Works like it is suppose to. Once opening the package, be careful as they all will disappear. Need to store in a medicine type bottle."
1,junk,I bought this thing 3 days ago It wouldn't start using the starter button so I did a manual start it did light but only in an inclosed place as soon as I took it outside it died and yes I waited the 2 minutes for it to heat up tried it a few times still the same thing If you want to sell something then lets get the word defective out of the product before we try to sell it.
1,Melts like butter,Fogger worked great until it melted. I went through about 1 1/2 bottles of the spray before the plastic housing and trigger assembly melted and fused together.What a waste of money.
2,cheaply made,"Bought it since we also got some at work, then found out how cheaply it's made. I used it maybe 7 or 8 times, sometimes it would make a good fog and sometimes not. The liquid reservoir leaks - there's not a real lid on it. Found this out later, so if it's not 100% upright any remaining liquid will drip out and get all over the place. The squirt mechanism isn't even as robust as the cheapest kid's water gun. Now it won't squirt and it's going in the trash. Seems like a great idea, and I'm willing to pay $60 or more for something similar, but I at least expect it to last one full mosquito season. Save your money on this trash and buy something else."
3,THE MOST DEPRESSING BOOK EVER,"I don't know why I gave this book three stars, since it is truly the most depressing book I have ever read. I have to say that despite that, it was hard to put down. It is about a retarded (and taken advantage of) man who hooks up with a total nutjob named Dottie. These two losers kidnap a little girl, and are on the run for the next five years. They have the most hideous lifestyle, they think they love this little girl, but are to stupid to realize how horrifyingly abusive and damaging their lifestyle is. They eventually hook up with a family that is even more depressing and deranged than they are. I think I stuck with the book in hopes of a good ending..which never happened. When I finished this horror, I actually felt sick, unsettled and depressed. I recommend reading this if you like to be severely depressed."
5,"Searing, Gripping and Original","This is one of the greatest books I have ever read and I am sure that the only reason it did not win both the Penn Faulkner and National Book Awards (It was nominated for both) is because it was the first novel Morris ever wrote. This book grabs you and plunges you into a world that when you emerge from it, you may never see the world you are in quite the same. WOW!"
3,its ok,"the mixes on this cd are nto really made for today, they sound like older disco mixes, not to crazy about it, i wish they woudl sound more like todays dance mixes. but its ok. should have had more songs, all the songs are 4 or 5 minutes long, and were is the hex/mac mix of i never knew. this really is for serious gloria fans."
3,Life Goes On,"One is ill, another has to go on with life. It wasn't as good as some others I have watched, but it was a clean movie showing the worst about Alzheimers."
1,DISGUSTING!!!,"The hero??? of this book is a violent rapist! I don't know about other women, but I like to read about men who are sensitive,loving,caring and most important of all gentle. Not this kind of garbage!"
2,Product was open when I received it.,"I buy this product every 3 months. Usually you have to remove the foil safety seal on the inside of the bottle, however when I received the lotion from them this past Friday, there was no seal, and it felt like half the bottle was missing. I will be filing a complaint with Amazon today."
2,We've Heard This Before...,"What I disapprove most about James Horner is that he borrows from the works of others or reuses his previous scores (Titanic and Deep Impact, anyone?) for inspiration for his newest scores. As for this soundtrack, James Horner completely ripped the title score ""Ethiopia, Pt.1"" from The Prayer Cycle's ""Movement 6: Innocence"" which featured the vocals of Salif Keita and Alanis Morissette and was showcased during the opening credits of ""The Affair of the Necklace"". If you listen to the two, there's almost not a single bit of difference - except that the latter is far better.As for the soundtrack, its good - I just disapprove of the uncanny resemblance of this piece of work with already previously released works from other artist's."
4,Juke Box Jive,"After the band had signed with Mercury Records, their former label - Columbia Records - released this 10-song set that takes a glance at the three studio albums released from 1976-1978.The trio of albums - I Don't Want to Go Home (1976), This Time It's for Real (1977), Heart's of Stone (1978) - were critically-acclaimed, but did not meet the marketplace expectations set by the record company. The sizzling R&B; sound cuts right to the roots of rock-n-roll.Maybe it was the close linkage with Bruce Springsteen, the coming of punk rock or FM radio playlists that focused on arena heroes, but Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes never broke out from the bars. It was not because of inferior material or band indifference....this is one of the best groups to burst onto the scene in this ""Golden Age of Rock."""
1,Constant static sound reminds me of the 1970's AM radios,"The static sound is constant no matter what volume or if you're playing from CD, IPOD or Radio. Radio reception is bad too. These are easy things to get right. The manufacturer must have had to cut some pretty serious corners to foul this up."
2,Great fetures but sounds terrible,So if this sounded like it did not have blown speakers it would be a great item. if you have to have a Ipod Boom box for under 100 bux then this is a great deal. If you have to have some decent sounds come out of it look elsewhere.
2,Beware,"Could not find a unit at this price that had more on it and I was thrilled enough with all of its features to buy 3 (one for each of my sons for Christmas). I had bought the first 2 at Meijer and could not find a third until I found this one on Amazon. I am nervous because I aleady had to bring one back to Meijer. After only 2 weeks one was making a VERY loud noise, like an alarm clock and went back to Meijer. Unfortunately we only saved one box so I am hoping the others don't break too. If you buy save your box and receipt."
1,"First edition, not 1899",This book is a first edition reprint of the first edition not an actual first edition book. The product title is misleading and I was unsatisfied with the purchase.
4,Nice recap,"It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s ""heydays,"" including the crank-it-up ""Gotcha"" (Starsky & Hutch TV theme song) and soulful ""Shadows,"" among others. I was disappointed more from ""Blow It Out"" wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott. If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this. Certainly worth $..."
5,Excellent Seller & Product!,"This book (the 2nd I've read by Evan Twede)was well-written, to the point & the information is accurate. The seller shipped immediately & the book was exactly as described. Will return to this seller--thank you:-)"
2,Rust Spots,"I bought this knife as part of a collection from CulenHome as a gift for my parents. Unfortunately, when it arrived, my father said the packaging had split open and there were tiny rust spots along with little dents on the entire blade. He took the rust off himself which made the dents less noticeable. Very disappointing considering it is supposed to be ""Stainless Steel"" The design itself is beautiful though. They are very pretty knives."
2,Incontinent...,"Imagine a rusting, leaky, creaky, hulk of a ship loaded with high explosives that go boom when they get damp, a cranky crew, and a passenger list borrowed from the love boat. Now, put these poor wretches through a mutiny, a hurricane (in a lifeboat), a shark attack, and being lost at sea. Next, add a tangled mess of killer seaweed. Then, throw in a spanish galleon full of pirates / conquistadors / inquisitors and big-boobed babes who walk around on the killer seaweed in balloon shoes (I'm not kidding)! Finally, toss in a few floppy, rubber ""monsters"", hand-made by four year olds, and you've got THE LOST CONTINENT. The title is interesting, considering the fact that NO continent, lost or otherwise, ever appears in this film! Just lots of seaweed, boredom, and plot threads that add up to nothing in particular. With all that's going on in this movie, you'd think it couldn't possibly stink. Think again..."
2,This ain't the whole Pirate,"After giving up all hope for a DVD edition of this very special film, I purchased the import advertised on this web site. Alas, the quality was poor and the film just stopped in the middle of the Nicholas Brothers' dance with Gene Kelly. Whoever packaged this abomination should be required to watch every Charlton Heston movie ever made. Twice."
4,Why oh why did Al have to sing?,"Please, if you get this CD skip over tracks 3 and 8... they are certainly the most annoying tracks ever on an Al CD.The rest of it is great though..."
1,East to the Dawn: The Life of Amelia Earhart,"I can't believe the author spent 10 years researching this book. I've found two errors in the first chapter. Pottawatomie Creek (pg 12) is not west of Atchison, Ks. It's approximately two hours to the south. Kansas State University (pg 23) is in Manhattan, Ks. It does not have a law school. The law school is located at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. These facts could be easily verified in a short amount of time."
3,Detailed biography,I would have enjoyed reading about Amelia without all of the background and generational material. This book is definately the final word on Amelia!
4,Excellent text for an introduction to computer technology.,"I have used the last three editions of this book and been impressed with the author's willingness to revise and upgrade it as the technology evolves and progresses. Despite a wide range of backgrounds and abilities, my students have been almost universally complimentary about it's value. The auxillary material offered online is excellent, aiding the beginners while still providing a challenge or two for the semi-experts bent on validating their knowledge.The illustrations support the text very well, and the material covers a great deal of ground from the history of computing to the propagation of the Internet. This is an excellent introductory book, very well written."
3,dr oz suggested this product,"I bought this in replace of coffee and in hopes to jump start my metabolism. But I could past the smell when drink it, It smelled like a barn. if you breww it and let it chill and make ice tea with added flavoring it is drinkable."
4,Works for me,"I bought this tea from viewing Dr. OZ and he recommended drinking it for help burning belly fat. I'm not so sure how that is working for the fat burning being as I just started it, but so far one thing I can say is it has been surpressing my appetite when I drink it. The taste is smooth for me, but the smell isnt the best. Overall it works for me!"
5,Awesome,"This is an awesome product. It will wipe out the weeds within a couple of days. Be careful, it easily catches fire to anything in its path."
2,Not what we'd hoped,"Not terribly effective. The flame seems not really hot enough to actually kill many of the local weeds and grasses, though it looks scary to the neighbors, who think we're about to start a brush fire. (This is Southern Arizona.) The device is also awkward to use without getting a proper propane tank dolly. I tried to gerry-rig a tank tied to a hand-truck. Didn't really work, though it might with a hand-truck of a different design. The one Red Dragon offers costs more than the Weed Dragon itself. Might be worth it if the flame system really did the job with the weeds, but that doesn't seem to be the case -- around here, anyway."
4,torch,"Works great, have had lots of fun with it. Only down fall I wish it had a lever instead of the dial."
3,Not a very pretty result,"The Item works, it does kill the weeds quickly and effectively. The thing I don't like about it is that the weeds don't just disappear after being burned, instead you end up having a lot of ugly looking yellow spots in your garden. Another disappointment was that I was expecting to use it to get rid of poison ivy in my property but when the item arrived, in the instruction manual it says you shouldn't use it with any poisonous plant. Had I known this before hand I wouldn't have bought it but there was no mention about this in the item description nor it's website."
1,This book seems to be just a ploy to sell author's wares,"I was really disappointed in this book -- especially considering the price and the lack of credible reseach within the book. Instead of exploring the topic fully and providing a solid grounding for the recommendations, chapters are wasted discussing specific tm tools of the authors/consultants. The content of this book has been done before -- usually in shorter magazine articles and often more thoroughly."
3,Cute but pricey,"This is a very cute doll and weighted much like that of a real baby, however, this is a bit expensive for a ""toy"" doll. I also bought two of the other Molly P. Originals and feel the same way about them. Too expensive for a ""play"" doll. Fine if you want to put the doll up as a collectable. The hair and clothing is of good quality, however just above the hands and feet you will immediately find sewn fabric.I bought these as toys and think that next time I would buy a less expensive doll for playing with that also has a lifelike quality."
4,Very informative,I have long been familiar with the Deane/Balderston version. This book provides the missing piece; the script that Hamilton Deane wrote that toured England and made such a sensation before it came to America.
4,Max Strom is an amazing teacher.,I think anyone wanting to learn more about yoga anotomy and alignment should watch this video. I also recommend TAMARA'S YOGA FUSION
2,Difficult to assemble/paint,Woodland Scenics are some of the hardest HO scale things to assemble and color. Very different product than the picture on amazon shows.
2,Sort of works - but no faster than weeding by hand,"It only works in areas where you only have weeds (as fire could kill other less sturdy plants) and where it is not easy to start a fire (need to be careful about it - may want to use it after it rained.Also, don't think it is fast (takes as long as weeding by hand)or that it kills all weeds. Basically you need to flame the weeds, wait a week and finish the job by weeding by hand. I personally prefer then weeding by hand and remove the roots rather than just weakening."
5,"Red Dragon VT 3-30 C 500,000 BTU Heavy Duty Propane Vapor Torch Kit","Rate AAA+++. Recommend for all. What you want is what you get. he he.Recommend.Red Dragon VT 3-30 C 500,000 BTU Heavy Duty Propan"
3,"Fun, But NOT Great","I got the Red Dragon kit after reading all these reviews... but honestly, I am not that impressed. Yeah, it sounds cool, but it is not like the thing cuts through ice. It melts the ice generally, but it is far from being ""dragon-like."" Frankly, I expected more. I just cant believe it doesnt simply melt the heck out of ice... but it doesnt. Oh well."
1,KC and the Sunshine Band 25th Anniversary Collection,I have not even opened this because the first two CDs I ordered from Amazon sounded like they were fake!
4,THE ULTIMATE PARTY BAND OF THE DISCO ERA...,"... it's practically impossible to resist the lure of the dance floor when a classic KC song starts to play - are there any songs being recorded today that have that same impact? I haven't heard any... rock critics can criticize disco all they want, but they were missing out on all the fun - man, those were the days!My only critique would be the exclusion of the extended club version of ""Give It Up"", otherwise, a terrific 2-cd set."
5,Comfort,"This mattress topper is wonderful. My back does not hurt when I wake in the morning. Compared to the mattress I paid $1500.00 for that my ex has, this reasonable priced topper is just as good."
4,"Well worth it, but make note of the size discrepancy","This was money well spent. I added the queen topper to my mid-grade full size mattress and it fit almost perfectly. The only trouble was with the depth of the corners on my fitted sheets. The topper made it a little too tall, but the queen size seemed as if it were cut for a full size mattress length and width wise. Size discrepancies aside, the topper made for a much more comfortable bed. There has been less tossing and turning, and I have not noticed the springs in my mattress since adding this topper. Considering the bang for the buck, I recommend it."
4,Who's in the Kitchen with THAD?,"Sin was an interesting story of individualism and rising above the status quo. While an obsessive tug of love was the underlying theme, the struggle Thad encounters trying to spread his wings and make his dreams manifest was inspirational. Through his whole eye-opening journey and labor to please his woman, father, mother and the memory of his brother, I enjoyed this novel mainly because it shows the downside of bringing others into your dream and how friendships can be as phony as a three dollar bill. From a relationship aspect, this novel is a psychotic terror filled ride as Thad is strapped on to a woman who makes Glen Close in Fatal Attraction look like Martha Stewart meets Mr. Rogers."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This book was not worth the time spent reading though it. If I had not received it as a gift, I would not have wasted my time reading the entire book. It was very mediocre with absolutely no substance. Meandering for 235 pages and ending with a twist from out of the blue made it seem as though the author thought of the ending at the last moment.I definitely would not recommend it."
2,Ms. Foley has written better,"I am a great fan on Ms. Foley's writing, and while the book was not poorly written per se, the characters were not compelling. I am in no way adverse to an espionage type romance, but how on earth the Puritanical Alice was paired with Lord Lucifer (Lucien) was beyond me.Alice was too prim, too proper, too naive, and rather annoying. Very annoying, even.It seems very easy to create a Stupid Illogical Heroine. To illustrate this- Alice witnesses the death/murder of a Russian spy, then afterwards when Lucien warns her to stay away from London because her life is in danger, she responds angrily that all he does is lie, and why should she take his word. (I'm paraphrasing). I mean really you imbecile !There ought to be a rating system for these blockhead heroines."
3,More depth please!,"Where shall I start... characters undeveloped and full of irreconcilable differences; a master spy that commits the same mistake again and again; a heroine that faces choices that are not real choices. And the list goes on. I could not keep thinking that the heroine needs to grow up and face life. But what really annoyed me enough to make me write this commentary is that the respected American author is confusing the Wild West with Napoleon Era England. Let just say to Ms. Foley THERE ARE NO SHERIFS in England neither at that time, not ever nor since. This is an entertaining book but I would advice you buy it used. It I not worth USD7. More research would behoove the author."
4,some good songs,"hi,first, it seems that the sound is remastered, it's so good for musiclovers! get the words of each song and a nice packaging with!I think, that there are 4 great songs on this album, Lightnin' in the sky, Love, Hard times and Aqua marine, and maybe Stand up! the other songs are not so bad but not unforgettable!a good copy this 30th anniversary edition!"
2,nothing kills weeds,"This thing sounds like a jet engine and seems wildly dangerous to set up, light, and operate at the end of the day is non-effective. Cool but a week later the weeds or anything for that matter have grown back with vigor. But cool"
1,"Love dewalt, but this adapter is trash.","Bought this adapter 6 months ago somewhere also,after only 3 times I used it broke just like any tool from china, dewalt better start hiring better engeneers, makita has passed you guys in quality and diversity of tools, thanks."
5,Very Useful,"This is a must-have in my view for a professional using an impact driver. It allows you to use regular drill bits in your impact driver. It's easy to use and very solid. I've used mine professionally for a few years now, and it's been very effective. It also allows you to use your impact driver as a hammer drill."
4,dewalt dw0521,great for dewalt 1/4 drive impacts. The makita version doesnt fit right in Dewalt products.price is high but other than that it works
1,locked up and no good,"I have only ever used one drill bit in this chuck. It is a 3/8"" pilot point titanium bit that will not release from the chuck. I have tried everything I could think of to release it to not avail."
3,Social history,"This is not a costume book in the usual style of ""how to design your own medieval garb"" but it is a good introduction to the crafts involved in making clothing in the late Middle Ages and the attitudes of the people wearing those garments. It is a social history rather than a manual, and it is very interesting. My only complaint is that a great number of the illustrations are from the early 16th century and so are better examples of transitional styles than purely medieval ones."
3,Useful text with some inaccuracies,"The text is straigtforward and readable. However, it is not thorough in treating all areas, and there are some inaccuracies. Clinical applications and case studies are helpful."
2,A bit advanced for a 2yr old,"My 2.5yr old son owns almost all of the Brainy Baby DVDs (he's got 10 of them) so when I saw this DVD and read the positive reviews I bought it and Brainy Baby Art. When we received it I sat my son down and watched it with him. He just was NOT interested in this video. After a few minutes he went off and started playing with his toys. At 2 he's not interested in knowing wind instruments, string instruments, quartets, harmony, etc. My son loves music and he loves making music on his keyboard and he owns alot of musical instruments he loves playing. This video seemed a bit to advanced to be understood by a 2 or 3yr old unless they're gifted. I'm going to put this video up and try it when my son's 3.5 or 4yrs old. If you've got a 2yr old who's interested in music I'd suggest ""Blue's Big Musical"" wich is more toddler friendly. He LOVES that DVD."
5,Making Music,This video is great! We originally saw part of it on cable on demand and decided to order it. My 14 mo. old loves it!
1,Piece of junk,Very disappointed - the plug doesnt stay in the only way to use it is to hold the plug into yoru phone. Very disappointed
3,GOOD SELLER,DVD got lost in the mail but Seller immediately credited my account. Not their fault!! I would deal with them again in a heartbeat. A+++
5,Fun!,The children that I babysit for absolutely love it! They dance around and sing like crazy! I get a good laugh out of it!
4,Joy watching the grandbabies,I have two grandchildren ages 1 1/2 and 3 1/2 and they love dancing and marching to the Laurie Berkner Band. It is such a joy to watch them and participate with them!!!
5,Fantastic DVD What's not to love?,All I can say is that it is about time! My kids love Laurie Berkner on Noggin and it is great that we now can watch more than one video at a time. I only wish it were longer because my kids love it so much. I hope they put another DVD soon. Highly recommended.
3,not the best from brainy baby,"This is alot like flash cards on TV. I sit with my twins while watching this talking about it with them, about 2/3 thru the dvd we all are ready to goudge our eyes out. It gets irritating very fast imo. Some kids and parents may really like this dvd, it just didn't fly at our house.I (we) do very much like the 2 other Brainy Baby dvds we have : )."
4,Very good,Very good to teach the kids but they should use more children to make the baby interact more. My son like ( your baby cab read) more.
3,Great Atmosphere !,Horst Frank dominates the cast in an eerie amospheric horror tale that is somehow interesting without being blatant !!
5,very good starp,very nice strap i love it would buy more if needed seem's strong hold's up well not much more i can say
4,A notch below,"Not as introspective and complex as 'Point of Know Return', not as catchy and powerful as 'Leftoverture', and somewhat uneven. Nonetheless, a decent follow-up to two absolute masterpieces - but don't start your Kansas collection with this one."
1,Middle School English Teacher's Nightmare,"I really wanted to like this book. Time travel, witches, Salem, all story elements that I enjoy. However, this book is so badly written, I couldn't finish it. I tried, I really tried. I rarely give up on a book. The characters are painfully stereotypical and one-dimensional. No one would have the inane conversations depicted. The book is reminiscent of the creative writing efforts of my 7th grade students. I am surprised this book made it to publication. I wish I could get my money back--it's that bad."
3,size is best feature,"This is great for running. It is light, and fits perfectly in your hand. It is easy to skip songs, and adjust volume while running. Things I don't like are the arm strap (to big for me), headphones it comes with (lightweight and won't stay put), and the fact that I can never get it to turn off - I just take the battery out. And I go through a ton of batteries."
4,Rockin!!,"If you want something to manage your MP3s and take care of all your audio needs, look elsewhere... If you want to play MP3s while you workout, or drop into your car player (with adapter of course) for an hour or two and that's all, this rocks!! The software that comes with it really blows but gets the job done, transfers are fast enough, but it really shines when your pumping in the weight room or running, really small, really light. I did not like the ear-buds it comes with (I just don't like ear-buds period), but a simple replacement for the Sony sport headset and I am thrilled. One note, if you have 18"" arms or bigger, you will have to get creative with the arm-strap... oh well, I got it to work and stay in place well without cutting off the circulation to my hand."
3,I've used both these and the four prong cutters...,"For use in a hand held drill, the four prong cutters work much better. These cutters tend to walk all over the board before grabbing hold. On the other hand, properly controlled in a drill press, the waste is much less with these as the cutting edge is much thinner.As mentioned in a previous review, the General plug cutter burns the wood much easier than the four prong vesion...the bottom is essentially a flat rotating knife edge with only one cutting slot. Feeding it too fast, or at too high rate of speed builds up a lot of heat very quickly. The multi-prong cutter chews through the wood much faster and cuts a wider groove. The chips clear easily and this pretty much avoids the heat problem. If you go with the General Tools cutter, run it at a slow speed and back it out of the hole often to allow the chips to clear and the cutter to cool."
1,didn't receive a plug cutter at all,arrived in package was not a plug cutter instead was a bunch of brass pilot tips i am sending back to amazon i really needed it but now i guess i will go to spend money elsewhere
2,Not so much,"Unfortunately, I didn't find much reading pleasure in this book. The book covered some very basic details of cemeteries and the mourning process."
5,A Wonderful Show!!!,"I recently purchased the first season of American dreams, and I must say it is a wonderful show. I'm surprised that such a wonderful show only lasted 3 seasons, the show should still be on the air now. I love its' family values, it shows hard working parents who love and care for their children. There is some history there, it takes place in the early sixties during President Kennedy & Johnson administration and the impact of Vietnam and Civil Rights Movement. I love the music and the American Bandstand TV program used to set the mood of the decade of the show.If seasons 2 & 3 ever go on sell, I will gladly purchase them"
5,LOVE it!,Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed these dvds... put us right back in time as we re-lived the events depicted in these videos. The music is awesome.
4,The one disappointment,"I would have given the ""American Dreams"" DVD set 5/5 stars, but I only give it 4/5 because I was disappointed that there was not a commentary track for each and every episode. Otherwise an excellent DVD set of an excellent first season of a show that only seems to get better with each new season."
5,My fave REO album,"This is my favourite REO cd.It is a great cd i love it,and i love the art work also which REO always had cool art work."
1,STOP!!!!! don't be fooled,do not buy this game it a rip off the gold edition is not supported by the website and is out of date please don't get fooled like i did your wasting your money. buy a more updated editions they will work this one is useless. the guys selling this game should be ashamed of him self
3,A Hit and Miss Collection With a Few Nice Rarities...,"Fans of Daltrey's vocals will enjoy this collection, particularly the first disc which collects songs from his more well-received early solo albums. There's not a lot new there, though, if you're already familiar with his solo work. The second disc has a lot of potential, but the song-selection is somewhat frustrating (particularly when it comes to picking songs from Daltrey's good-to-excellent ""Rocks in the Head"" album). There are a handful of really nice rare live tracks, though, including a version of ""Born to Run"" that'll have you wondering why he chose to do this song in concert. Finally, the collection closes with a ""new"" studio track that shows there's more to Daltrey's vocal technique than just macho bluster. Overall, it's a fine collection to have and definitely worth picking up on the cheap BUT, if you like what you hear, be sure to get a copy of ""Rocks in the Head"". You won't regret it!"
3,Only for the Dinosaur lover!,"My daughter loved Zoo tycoon. I thought she would like this more, but no. She thinks Dinosaurs are cool but the care and up keep a zoo was not very natural. By natural I mean, she thinks of a Dinosaur in the wild, and it made he uncomfortable thinking of ways to pin them in. It is a mindset that made her stop using the game after a couple of tries.You might have better luck, but that's what happen to me."
3,Good computer game but not alone.,"Dinosaur Digs is a great computer game but not by itself. In order to enjoy the game fully you need Zoo Tycoon & Marine Mania. With the three games together you will get the full feel of a zoo, how to run it, keep the guests and animals happy etc. Even if you have Dinosaur Digs & Zoo Tycoon it will not be complete without Marine Mania. Make sure to get Marine Mania as it includes Dinosaur Digs as an added bonus.With all three of these games you and your children will enjoy hours of fun building and maintaining your own zoo. Just don't forget, unhappy guests mean no money for your zoo which means unhappy animals and no funding from outside sources for new exhibits, etc."
3,The halfling's Gem,"""And the beat goes on"". Unfortunately the Legend of Drizzt series is starting to seem stale. When the series began, Drizzt was a very interesting and multi-faceted character, surviving in an underground society that rewarded treachery and evil. A magical and ruthless world where he felt like an outsider. A world that was becoming more and more an anathema to him. However, since escaping to the surface world his character and the story lines have become ""samo, samo"". While the Halfling's Gem was a little bit better (introducing albeit briefy a possible love interest for Drizzt), it seems R. A. Salvatore missed the opportunity to more fully develop some of his new characters, whichinmy opinion would have enhanced the storytelling. May be he was behind on his publishing deadline. Alas, it seems Salvatore has has run out of original and creative ideas."
1,this isnt what it looks like..,Thought it was the full blown movie and it wasnt. dont waste your time downloading it. its just a preview thing.
1,Not my thing,I don't like most making of movie prologues. I actually hit this by mistake thinking it was the movie. It wasn't and so I stopped watching it. I'm reviewing just to get the thing off my to be reviewed page.

3,Decent cd,"I only expected one cd i got 2 it was decent... i didnt know who they were until about 2 weeks ago... buy the cd, fast shipping."
5,Great Workout - Watch your neck,"Very, very good workout. I am an avid Jillian fan and have all of her DVD's. This is intense. I workout 5 times a week and am probably intermediate/advanced level. I am still on level 1. Of course I do a different DVD every day so as to change things up. The only problem with this workout is if you have ANY kind of neck issues don't go here. The first time I did this I had a sore neck for 3 days. I know form and all that bull so I know I was doing the circuits correctly. Please be careful. Otherwise, this is another good one from Jillian."
3,"Good for variety, but don't depend on it for your fitness","I have all of JM's DVDs and Biggest Loser and Jackie and a bunch of other ones. This is definitely not one of her best and overall her latest products don't really rock, like 30-day Shred, Boost Metabolism and Trouble Zones did. That said, it is a decent core workout. My abs were definitely not sore the next day with either of the work outs and I am in medium fitness stage right now. Don't expect to see six-packs in 6 weeks with this workout alone. Even though the second workout is more aerobic, it still is not challenging enough to achieve this goal. You will definitely have to do something harder and in fact, I think trouble zones had a better ab workout than this DVD. That said, for people that work out at home a lot, it does add variety with different exercises that give you a chance to change the angles that you work out your abs and this is definitely beneficial to get a six-pack."
5,I'm convinced!,"I am nodding along with many of the reviews I've read here. I am devoted to my (admittedly not hardcore) workouts, six days a week, for many years now, but my midsection does not reflect that. I just finished six weeks of this program and can actually see a difference! I did it three times a week, with a 15-30 minute brisk walk after, and continued running and doing cardio machines three days a week. I sweat more in a half hour of this than I do five miles running. It's fantastic for someone who doesn't have much time but is ready to give it their all.No, definitely not your traditional ""crunches on the floor"" ab workout. In fact, I was really skeptical starting Workout 2 b/c it felt like mostly lunges. Somehow it did hit my core. I feel strong! Definitely worth trying!!"
2,it's ok...,"It is pretty good compared to most workout dvds...and very intense...What I did like the most is that there was a way to start at a low impact level and work my way up to the Levels 2 and 3. I was able to decide how long to stay at each level. The thing I didnt like was the workout not having much abs workout.. The sound was good, and the quality was great....but there was no good music..that was fun to work out to... Good music definately motivates you to keep going even though it hurts... It is well worth the money,.."
2,Good= But .......................,"Yeah you'll sweat, sure you may lose inches- but my neck kills me everytime I do her workout...And yes ! I do have proper form... I know what it is...I want feel sore in my abs but I'm not- I'll give it another try - so far only level 1 - Oh well ill keep you posted..."
5,"Great, Great, Great!","Jillian does a great job overall. For the person(s) that get injured, I wouldnt say that's Jillians fault, so I dont think its fair to not give full stars because of an injury you did to yourself. She explains about form and geting core strenght to lessen the chances of injury. I would highly recommend her videos, I use to work out 6 days a week till I had my son(then a size 2, now a size 4) and its hard for me to get to the gym now, I just started her videos this week and on the 2nd day my abs were super sore. This is an ab work out, like she says you have to shed the pounds by doing cardio and working on your abs at the same time."
4,"Pretty good, not too long, and feels effective","I really liked the 30-Day Shred DVD, so when I saw this, I pre-ordered it and did it for the first time yesterday. It's a good workout, and I like the length of it -- it's not SO long that I feel like turning it off before finishing, but it's not short either. I expected mainly variations of regular crunches, but this video contains a lot of moves I didn't expect, some of which target legs/buttox, so it's actually more varied and interesting than I expected an abdominal workout to be.I'm sure that sticking with it will lead to results!"
3,She's tough.,If I had the motivation this would be a great DVD but I have to say its definitely not for a beginner.
4,An Excellent Introduction,"I first heard ""Baby, Better Start Turning 'em Down"" on a sampler LP of New Music from Columbia Records. It was the best song on the collection so eventually I decided to buy the album it came from.To be honest, nothing else on the album matched the immediate sensation I felt when hearing this song for the first time. But that's not to say I was disappointed. Rosanne Cash's ""Right or Wrong"" was a pleaseant surprise with lots to recommend it. At the time, the arrangements and production (by then husband, Rodney Crowell)were innovative and fresh. The music had a definite country sound, however it also had a rock feel to it.A great introduction to what would become a tradition with me. I now proudly own every album she's ever made."
5,"If the single is this good, I wonder how good the CD will be","I think that this song is tight and that the cd will be even better. I heard a few of there other songs in concert and they were all just as good and some were even better than this, so I expect that the CD will be really good."
1,Don't Buy This One!,"My son insisted on putting this toy on his Christmas list for Santa to bring. This toy has the most misleading commerical I have ever seen in my life! The toy itself falls apart as you play with it. The rope that Spider-man is suppose to glide down only cause him to crash his legs into the bridge and it stops him. Every ""action"" feature has some kind of problem with it. My son wouldn't part with it though and continues to try to make it work. Heartbreaking! I would gladly return it or trash it. It I could rate it lower than one star I would. It doesn't deserve any stars! Please don't waste your money or time on this toy."
1,Difficult for kids of all ages to work.,I bought this toy for both my Spider man crazy boys for Christmas and it was awful...from the get go we could not get the play set to stay standing up and working the pulley that spider man is supposed to glide on was difficult for my boys. My oldest is 9 so it is not like I need to hold his had to play anymore. We finally got rid it because it was such a source of frustration. Please do not waste your money.
1,speechless,I am speechless that a company could manufacture such a horribly cheap and flimsy toy and be allowed to charge what they do for it! It should be a federal offense. It will not remain standing and constantly comes apart. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for it at a garage sale.
1,Dont buy this!,"This toy was purchased for my 4 year old son for christmas by his gramdmother, and from the moment we put it together, it just fell apart! Very unsturdy, pieces dont fit, the bar that Spiderman is suppose to magneticaly stick to is very flimsy, and just pops out of the sides so he cant even perform. My son said he really wanted this, so he got it, but we are very dissapointed in the construction and the performance of it.Not to mention the cost! It just basically sits in his room in the closet in pieces. I wouldn't recommend buying this toy, especially for the high price it is going for."
1,Overpriced dust collector,"Toy biz should go back to the drawing board with this toy. I didn't believe the incredibly poor ratings that this toy received. Our son wanted it so we bought it. Then, we opened it to put it together. 1st, a piece was already broken off when we opened it, and it wasn't even in the box to superglue it back together. This toy not only doesn't stand up to a 5 year old, it barely even stands up. Its base was poorly designed. Did they actually let some kids test this toy first??? You know real kids, not adult wanna be-s. They only thing that my son liked after 15 minutes of trying to keep the playset upright while using the web was the Spiderman magnetic character(not worth 35$ alone). Toy Biz should've just made this figure available for sale by itself (the reviews would've been better). Don't waste this incredible amount of money for a hunk of junk. Believe what these people say. BUYER BEWARE!! Caveat emptor, surely."
3,Doesn't work,"My four year old son received this playset as a gift. It was fairly easy to put together, but fell apart as he tried to play with it. The set comes with a Spiderman with magnets on his hands and feet. Spiderman is supposed to be catapulted from a spring board onto the metal portions of the playset, but the momentum is too great and Spiderman seldom sticks. My son loved sticking the Spiderman to the refrigerator and anything else metal he could find. However, after two or three days the magnets fell out of both of his feet. He playset now sits in the box and now Spiderman only sticks to fridge with his hands. If your child loves Spiderman like mine, invest in the Spiderman action figures and let your child create their own adventures for Spiderman."
3,I keep only the box!,"I have a beautiful 6-year-old boy ho loves Spiderman! He got this as a birthday present. I am disappointed with the pile of junk he got! The whole system is unstable it falls apart very easy, the magnets on feet and hand of Spiderman are very powerful and stick and hold very well, but fell out the very next day. The net is supposed to be somewhat retractable, it does not work. The best thing about this toy is the box. DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
1,Cool looking waste of money,"No stars for this awful thing. My kids begged for this and we got it for Christmas. It was falling apart as we put it together. Finally my husband mounted it on wood with glue, nails and velcro (crazy that we paid 35.00 and we had to MOUNT it) and it stayed together a little better. It is all posterboard and plasitc chip pieces, if Spiderman tried to slide down the web, the toy would implode. It was pretty much in the trash can by the end of the week. Wish it would have been made better."
4,Better than the first one,Now the the series has been on the air longer the author has done a better job of catching how the crew of the Enterprise act. Well written and good story plot.
3,I found some good and some bad in this book.,"The plot itself held my interest enough that I wanted tofind out how it would end, but I did manage to figure outthe basics of what was happening well before the end ofthe story. I have to agree with others that the charactersdid not seem to come across as strongly as they do in theseries. Their ""spark"" was missing. And yet, even with itsshortcomings, this story came across to me much better thanEnterprise: By the Book."
4,Star Trek Enterprise: What Price Honor,"I really enjoyed the book. Too bad there aren't more about Enterprise than the few I've seen offered. For those who liked the TV show, you're into the action right away. Nice to recognize most of the people in the story."
5,No Market for Camouflage Clothing Here.,"HOW TO BE INVISIBLE is a dandy read. I needed the information in it for a short story I'm writing. I give it an A for the useful and humorous. What I learned from reading it should prove invaluable in making my story authentic. Further, if the fame I fantasize about descends on me--in the style of Stephen King or R. K. Rowling--I'll know how to handle it. General Grade: ASincerely, Eugene H. Bales"
1,Better off watching a Bourne supremacy movie,"A bunch of tired tricks from the pre digital area when it was ok to not have a picture ID.The author says he is hidden in the canary islands off the grid, but then discloses that he sells a whole series of Internet products.Think gypsy scam artist.Save your money."
4,some useful information,"At least this author doesn't rant against the government and tell the reader not to pay taxes. It is a more reasonable book than the last one I read. Some of the information is obvious, like not receiving mail at your home. Some of it is interesting - he recommends LLCs repeatedly, and just coincidentally happens to have someone in New Mexico who can hook you up. I don't know how useful his information is for the ordinary person who needs to hide from an abusive spouse, for instance. I still think that The Gift of Fear is the best book on that subject."
1,worthless,"I hope those who just got this and think this is a great product don't get burned like I did. I thought it was great at first too, but after a few weeks the battery held less and less charge and finally wouldn't charge at all. No help from customer service. Do not buy this."
5,If you have kids this is for you,"I love this. It is so much faster than getting out the large vaccuum. It's even fun. I use this mostly on the hardwood floors in my kitchen. Definately buy the larger one the extra mechanism that pushes the dirt in front of the sweeper is a must have, the smaller one does not have that feature and has less than 1/2 the charge life for the battery.This is great at picking up Cheerios and whatever else my 1 yr old throws off her high chair. I'm thinking of buying everyone I know one for Christmas."
4,Great for the Handicaped,"I have read the negative reports and am sorry they are not using this product correctly. This is a SWEEPER not a full size vaccuum. This is for quick pick ups between regular vaccuums, ie: a cereal or salt spill on the kitchen floor, fluff from your pet or just a quick touch up before someone comes over. That said, however, this does do the job of a lot of the full vaccuums. I use it quite often, even though I have a Roomba which I also love and a full vaccuum. I gave one to my sister who has MS and she is able to do some of her vaccuuming again. For someone with limited mobility with their balance or hands this will be very helpful. This is my second vaccuum for me. The first one I had I used for over 2 years and then found the vaccuum no longer held a charge for long, so I just replaced it with the latest model and love it even more."
1,Handle broke within 2 years,"I brought a Euro-Pro Shark Cordless Sweeper in 2004. It was light and easy to use; but, it doesn't last long. The top of the handle broke off after one year (just in time that the warranty won't cover the repair). Then the entire handle (stick portion) snapped off. This product is not made to last. Its life span is less than 2 years. Don't waste your money."
2,Disappointed,I returned this after two weeks. It wouldn't pick up much. I tried using it for the pine needles that had fallen off my Christmas tree - it just ran them over but didn't suck them up. Disappointing.
1,Rubbish,"This is a piece of rubish! I bought it, charged it for little more than 22hrs, and it could not even pick up the birdseed our bird messes on the floor! It is a wate of money, time, energy and gas, taking into account that I returned it the day after I bought it! The ""floor"" setting for harwoodfloors is pathetical, and then when you put it on ""carpet"", it at least picks up some of the dirt. I would not even give it to the Iranian presidant as a gift, let alone buy another one of these ""cordless stick vacuums"". They only seem to work on TV, NOT at your home. I cannot but wonder if there is not some or other ""trick photography"" behind those TV ads on this kind of junk. I had to give it one star, personally, I would give it ZERO stars."
1,More Like Minnow Than Shark,This thing doesn't hold a charge for very long and anything with weight gets left behind. They need to do more work on this idea.
4,Better than a stick vac,"We saw the Shark being used in a Mexican restaurant after a family with many children left. The job it did was amazing so we bought one for ourselves. It has not disappointed. It cleans carpeting and hardwood flooring equally, getting up all the little bits that stick vacs do not get. The Shark is just the tool to keep all floors looking tidy."
4,Mammatus - self-titled (Holy Mountain),"Looks to be the first of two CD releases from this West Coast four piece. Some would tag it as great 'stoner rock' as others might describe it as 'progressive metal'. You call it. Either way, this four song effort is pretty dang good. Tracks I thought were to be most inspiring were the last two cuts that appear to sort of run together. The eight-minute ""Dragon Of The Deep, Part 1"" and the soaringly epic twenty-two minute ""Dragon Of The Deep, Part 2"". Well done. Personnel: Nicky-guitar&vocals, Mike-guitar, Chris-bass and Aaron-drums. Might appeal to followers of Bongzilla, Monster Magnet, Electric Wizard, Kyuss and Sleep."
3,Scream Dream,"I feel that this was one of Ted Nugent's finest studio releases. It captured the early 80's hard rock sound just perfectly. With such songs as, Wango Tango, Scream Dream, and Termanus Eldorado, this is sure to satisfy your hard rock appetite."
3,Ted goes completely GONZO!,"OK, maybe on a mindless day this is a four star album, but this is Ted fully unleashed, full of Gonzo, and not giving a God Damn what anyone else thinks. Ted made this record on Ted's terms and for the Ted fans all over the world, and it's really good. Terminus Eldorado and Scream Dream (yep he screams alot!) are rockers, Wang ze Tango is a fun listen, however Hard as Nails and Spit it Out both just smoke. Charlie gets to sing I Gotta Move, and that's whats a little disappointing about this record, is that Charlie Hunh sang most of State of Shock and is hardly vocal on this album. Dispite that a fun record to have in your Ted collection."
3,Another overall disappointment from the Nuge,"This was the third disappointing studio album in a row by Ted, after the lackluster Weekend Warriors and State of Shock. This album is a little bit better, though, because of three songs: ""Wango Tango"", ""Scream Dream"", and ""Terminus Eldorado"". Cover your kids' ears if you're playing ""Wango Tango"" in their midst, because the lyrics are, even today, not for the young.As with his previous two studio albums, this band was never the same without Derek St. Holmes. The songwriting is pretty weak overall, and once again the production is VERY weak."
5,"Expensive, but Worthwhile","Yankee Candle is expensive, and I hesitate to buy it.However, I found that this candle is worth for the money.I like their small. I figure out that the quality of their candle is very good, and that must be how this candle is burning so well even in a such a big glass bottle."
1,This is really poor,"I have never seen such a bad horror film. The storyline is absurd. The scares are few and far between. The film uses light and shade but little in the way of creepy special effects. If you find the silhouettes of children in a house on a thundery night scary, this is for you. For me it was very tedious indeed and the storyline didn't make any sense either"
1,Plot gets lost in the Darkness.,"This film has very little to accomplish. It's on the exact same level, if not lower, as THE GRUDGE, THE FOG, RESIDENT EVIL:APOCALPSE, and many others. It's all style and not enough plot.It was confusing from begining, middle, and end.This could've been so much better if the film would have broken out of it's shell and done something different. I'm tired of seeing recycled themes.Pass this one up, you'll really be glad that you did."
1,A VERY DISAPPOINTING FLICK TO SAY THE LEAST,"I must say, I was very disappointed with Darkness. I really expected a lot more and this movie just does not deliver. The advertisements claimed it was scary, I didn't find it scary at all. In fact, it's just downright dull from the beginning and the ending makes no sense. So, if you get this movie expecting to be scared witless, forget it. Sorry, that's just my opinion on this one. I love thriller, suspense and non-gorey horror but this one just let me down. I am waiting to see Boogeyman and White Noise when they are released. I hope they turn out to be a little more entertaining than this one did."
1,"Hey, I Want My Two Hours Back!","Boring horror film with ugly actors repeating ugly lines. Over reaction abounds. Anna Paquin should drop a few pounds and trade her Oscar for some acting lessons. And what's with the pony tail? You have not seen overacting like this since Richard Boone died. You've seen every ""shocker"" in this film at least a hundred times in much better movies. And Ed Wood never wrote lines as lame as this ""script."" If ever there was a DVD made for the Wal-Mart five dollar bargain bin, this is it!"
3,Up to 3 stars for second viewing,"This movie would have gotten 2 stars from me after I saw it once, but at a get together one night it was shown and I watched it again and the plot seemed to make more sense the second time. It's not a real good movie, but if you watch it closely and pay attention there are a few good horror movie moments. The one thing I still don't get is the ending. I won't spoil the ending by saying what happened, but...What the??? Yes, I know the powers of evil are out there, but come on... Finally, Anna Paquin. I don't understand the fascination with her. She does okay looking somber, but other than that, she has no depth of character what so ever, in this or the X-Men movies."
2,Puts the B in Boring,And the B in Banal. The only good thing about Darkness was Anna Paquin. Nuff said. Wait til DVD for this one.
2,THIS NEEDED TO BE MORE SCARY AND A BETTER ENDING!!!!!!,"When i watched Darkness i was hoping for it to be at the edge of my seat and really scary!!!!!! What i got was not either one of those and i was really upset with this movie,because i saw a lot of trailers for this movie and it looked like it was going to be a awesome scary flick!!!!!! I loved where they filmed it in Spain and i like the settings,but the acting needed some work and the story needed to be more intense!!!!!! I have to say,but it had no ending i was like ok now what is going to happen!!!!!! They should have explained more and if they did and this movie was more intense and scary then i would rate it better then what i did,but unfortunately this movie deserves a two star or a one star and if you are in the video store i would not recommend you watch this movie and get something else!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Not Scary, but good acting from Paquin.","Anna Paquin Academy Award Winner* (Best Supproting Actress- The Piano) stars in ""Darkness"" from Miramax/Dimension the unrated version wasn't even violent!"
1,Not scary......,"Well I'm an avid fan of the movie horror genre, and even though people say that a scary movie is not ""scary"", I will defend the movie. I love seeing how directors will scare the audience, and how they will incorporate a good story line with it. But then I saw ""Darkness"". I was disappointed when I first saw this movie. First off I assumed the movie was scary because of the name and the many movie trailers I see on television. Second, the plot of the movie dept jumping and I got lost somewhere, and yet the ending didn't end, it continued into a dark hole. Well if you are a hardcore horror movie buff this one might not make the cut, but it is ok to watch."
2,Left me in the dark,"I love horror films. I'll forgive lots of loose ends, awkward cuts and tenuous logic. I'll suspend belief like a lobby chandelier if it will help the director move me. ""Darkness"", however, is just too bad a movie. When characters behave counter to humans everywhere, when the director throws in a white boa constrictor just because (I imagine) somebody on the set knows where to get one, when the particular rules of the movie's world are set aside for the sake of a chilling moment, when the ""revelations"" in the plot come about 20 minutes after they are painfully apparent, then, sad to say, the movie flops. Bigtime."
1,Oh my god. I couldn't even watch it all.,This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. I wouldn't even have somebody pay me $5 just to watch all of this terrible movie. NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIE!
2,"Slow, tedious, and ultimately boring...","This review is going to be short, to save us all some time. This film is not horrible, it has a couple (and I do mean two) good scares. BUT, the overall movie itself is terribly slow. You keep waiting for some kind of shock or revelation, but it never comes. Even the end, when you'd at least expect the tediousness of it all to pay off, it doesn't. Avoid this one. There are plenty of other good horror movies out there.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
2,"Meh, not very good","I knew this wasn't a Nero Wolfe book but Rex Stout's writing is so engrossing I thought I would enjoy this book. I was wrong. Poorly written, overly cliched, and deadly dull. Rex Stout does such a good job with male narrators but fails miserably with female. I forced myself to finish the book but, ugh."
4,Wonderful Christmas gift,"Woody Allen Collection, Set 1 was purchased for a Christmas gift. It's a wonderful collection, was very well received and has many of Allen's earliest movies; makes for a solid foundation to one's DVD collection."
3,Expected an extra fancy case from description..,"I went for the more expensive set because I thought it would be something special from the description. While the Woody Allen Collection is as expected, I was unhappy when I saw the slip case and I am now a buyer who will be much more aware when this dealer offers anything."
5,The Woody Allen Collection - 8 Pack,"How can I describe this collection? Woody Allen is a sheer genuis at what he does, and this is the best evidence of it. The best movie is without doubt - Annie Hall. A truly magnificent film!"
3,Four Words,Hannah and Her Sisters. What is a Woody Allen collection without this amazing film? I just don't get it.
4,"Great concert, missed a few songs","He had a great band back then, with horns added for his typical ""country jazz"" sound. Hag is in great shape vocally, too. The musicians all excel with great solos. So why only four stars. Just personal taste, I guess. I would have liked to hear songs like ""Today I started lovin' you again"", ""swinging doors"" plus other old, bluesy tunes. But, by all means, this is a disc well worth owning. Both picture and sound are top notch."
4,Never be another Merle,"I enjoyed this video of Merle Haggard very much. He is one of a kind, a poet, a musician, and sings from the heart. I would recommend this video to anyone, I will watch it many times."
4,This was exactly what i was looking for!,"Found this book on accident looking for a birthday present for a friend, who happens to be a Deaf lesbian! This turned out to be a great find, a really interesting book, & some insight for hearing people, gay or straight, into Deaf life & culture! A great book!"
4,greatest hits album,"This is bones first greatest hits package. It contains some of their biggest hits (not all), some rare songs, and a couple new tracks. U can buy this cd alone, or with the video. I recommend buying it with the video cuz of the rare interviews it contains. This cd has only one weakness: It shoulda been a double album. If bone put all of their hits, rare songs, and a few new songs; they could have easily made a double cd. This album peaked at #25 on the Billboard charts, and it has received the Gold award (over half a million copies sold)."
4,Amazon's Search engine falls apart!,The composer is Frederic Chopin. The performer is Arthur Rubinstein. This is a beautiful budget priced introduction to both the Polish composer and an incomparable pianist. I'll give it five stars when they remove Immer's name as (Composer).
1,I but a kid but is great!,"Still a great camerra if but you like bad cameras. I docked the dock by the dock. Hickory dickory dock. The camera is good, but I wish I could still write.I think that the batteries should give it power, but I only had it for two days.Sometimes it fits in my pants.this is a good camera unless you like good cameras then you should consider buying a different one one that is better or people will hate you everywhere"
3,"Good beginner package, but...","I like the convenience of this camera - it came with two sets of batteries - rechargable and standard lithium. It connects to theUSB port and downloads pictures fast. The downsides: the power button is small and often doesn't turn on/off unless youhold it down. The dock does not charge very well at least forme so sometimes the battery doesn't get charged all the way. Ifyou buy this, I'd recommend getting a case to go with it."
5,Charming story by a well-loved children's author,"This is a wonderful story about Fritz, a short, shaggy pony who lives his life in the shadow of the tall, sleek horses of the kingdom. His life changes, however, when this little ""nobody"" prances forward to rescue the children when the ""beautiful"" horses cannot.An endearing story which teaches children that true beauty is found inside. As with all Jan Brett books, the charming illustrations will captivate even the smallest of children.Add this one to your child's library ... it's sure to quickly become a favorite!"
4,Mostly good,"I love the illustrations in this book, and my horse-crazy daughters enjoy them too.I just think that the very end of the book [SPOILER - the citizens welcome Fritz into their town at the end because of him saving their children] wasn't handled the way I would have. It felt like an implicit ratification of the townspeople's attitude - still only the beautiful horses allowed in town, and Fritz is allowed because he worked so hard. I'd have preferred something about the people realizing that the heart matters more, or that they were wrong about what's most important (exterior vs. interior beauty). I don't think it would have needed to be heavy-handed.As it is, we don't read it that often and when we do, I find myself modifying the last few words. Or starting a discussion about being kind etc."
2,"Subtle, but still the wrong message","We received this as a gift.Pros: The illustrations are beautiful and richly detailed, as are all her books.Cons: As the story goes, only the 'beautiful' horses get to live inside the city walls. Once Fritz proves that he is useful, everyone thinks he's wonderful, he gets to live inside the walls, and the children take special care of him. So...what about the other not-beautiful horses outside the walls? Have they nothing to recommend them? Guess we'll never know, because no one gives them a chance. Or are we to just assume the villagers have learned their lesson and change their ways?This one mostly stays on the shelf. Try ""The First Dog"" instead."
4,One of the funniest stories told,"Jill is a wonderfully, alive crazy woman who has a bizarre family and work place to put up with. But she overcomes all obstacles placed in her path, including her own neuroses, to succeed professionally and personally. All of this in a great comedic novel. Laugh till you cry with this one."
3,"Alright, though you're better off reading the Narnia Series.","Hello, don't worry peoples, I have read every book in the Narnia Series well over three times, and I know what I'm talking about here. This book has lovely pictures, and even though the text is taken from the books, it just doesn't quite fit. The best things are not the main pages of the book, but instead The Cast of Characters and the timeline. Those are much more useful to you. I only recommend this if you love Narnia, but I'd advise you to go with the paperback edition, and never touch it again if you hate it. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the Cast of Characers and the timeline. Remember, only buy it if you are a devoted fan of Narnia, like I am, though I'm sure you'll like the book series better."
1,Not very good,"The problem I'm having with this item is that there is no tolerance % for the set desired humidity level. What I mean is, if I set it to 40% humidity, it turns on at 39% and turns off at 40%. What ends up happening is it goes on for 2 minutes, then goes off for 2 minutes, all night long! It should have something more of a tolerance, like 3-5%, so that is goes on at 35 and shuts off at 45, so that it's not going on and off constantly."
5,Humidifier with hygrostat sensor,"I purchased this product after using for a week, I think that I made a good decision. The best part of this product is digital preset humidifier; set the number of humidifier that you want and whenever it come to the right number that has been set it will stop itself, and when the air is dry it start itself. For example, I set my the humidifier at 40 in my room and when it come up to 40, it stop or when it drop less than 40 it start itself.I recommend to everyone whom need a good humidifier and don't want to have a mold in their room."
2,NOT for dog owners!,"I bought this product based on the reviews, as we're all suffering from the dry air in our apartment in the Chicagoland winter time. It certainly looks nice, seems to humidify OK, and is quiet as a mouse.... to HUMANS! The ultrasound vaporizer seems to be well into canine hearing range and drives our dog absolutely bananas. Her behavior went back to normal the moment we turned the device off, and back to battiness the moment we turn it back on.I am giving it two stars because the device seems to be OK otherwise. And I'd still recommend it if you don't have a dog (or another pet with hearing in the ultrasound range). But we will be returning it because it is basically useless to us: we cannot turn it on at all without torturing our dog."
3,Not as fun as I thought it would be,"My Daughter got this for her 3rd B-day. She played with it all day on the first day, and that was it. She hasn't touched it since. Not enough storage, and the oven door does not close all the way."
3,General Tools 55 Heavy Duty Circle Cutter,"While using this tool on 1/8"" aluminum, the arm kept getting loose. After it threw arm out twice I discontinued using it. Maybe it would be ok for much thinner material."
4,freud laminate wood blade,"If you are looking for a blade to cut laminate wood, this is your blade. Works well, clean cut."
2,Very Dissapointed,"I was dissapointed with this album because all the songs, except a few, are on the other albums I have of her. I do like the one with Brian McKnight, and the other ones that arent on other albums. It would of been better if she put songs that werent released."
3,CHEER UP!!,"HONESTLY, I BELIEVE MARIAH HAS ONE OF THE BEST VOICES BUT SHE NEEDS TO CHANGE. IT'S ALLWAYS THE SAME SAD SONGS. COME ON GIRL! CHEER UP!!"
5,"An excellant, must have cd for any Mariah Carey fan!","With 13 #1 singles under her wing, it was only fitting that Mariah released them all on one disc. They compilation is awesome, how can one go wrong when putting 13 chart toppers together? The four new songs, Sweetheart, When You Believe, Whenevere You Call, and I Still Believe are just as good. I Still Believe is the best of the 4 new ones. Mariah sings so much better alone then with other artists. Her voice is as powerful as ever and she puts her all into I Still Believe. Mariah is one of the best singers of her time and a cd like this allows you to listen to all the favorites on one disc. But don't call this a greatest hits, because it is not that at all...ask Mariah herself!! These are just the number ones according to the general public and Billboard, her greatest hits...now that is a cd to wait for !!!"
2,"Okay, she can sing, but not a singer","Give her some credit she can sing. Diva, NOT! Just because she can sing, you cannot call her a diva. Just because she sold alot of records, that does not make you a diva. Classic, she is not. She is more hip-hop,r&b. Proving she is not a diva, look at the cover of her album. She is great for the young crowd to get up and dance. When you talk about divas, classics, look for Celine, Whitney, etc.. A little more experience and maybe she is ready to be called a diva. She need to get pass, Janet Jackson, Toni Braxton, Celine Dion, etc. One more thing Mariah, get over your body. Sleezy, is not considered a diva. Take some lessons from Celine and Whitney."
3,HOT Cover!,"This CD came out the same time as Jewel's CD - one has a HOT cover and the other looks like a snaggle-toothed ragamuffin! The music? Not exactly my cup of tea, but with a cover like that..."
3,WHY IS IT BACKWARDS!?!,"I do like that Mariah supposedly ""hand picked"" this compilation, but what drives me up the wall is the fact the stupid thing is backwards. All the newer songs (bar I Still Believe) are at the beginning and all her later hits are at the end, which makes it very confusing when manually looking for a certain track on the CD player. The track listing isn't on the back, either. It's on the insert. The back just has a randomized list of songs on a bullet chart. If you want to get technical (and I don't really give a crap about the number status of her singles), I believe a hand full of the songs never exactly made it to one on the chart."
1,painful,"I have heard all the songs on this cd and have to say it was painful to listen to. Mariah is beyond boring and unoriginal, how did she get so many number 1 hits. Mariah sings about love which I think she doesn't truly understand. She married an old guy because he had a lot of money, married for money not love. So how can act as if she knows love when she marries for money. Her songs are not the true Mariah Carey, they are lies to cover the truth that she is unable to love. She has no soul and this album proves that she makes the songs for money. Most recent hit is heartbreaker not featured on the 1hits album."
1,Horrible!!,"This is a really bad album!! The only decent track on this CD is ""when you believe"" with beautiful Whitney Houston. What happen to MC's voice on ""I still believe"".? Did she have a bad cold when she recorded that last track? I wish Mariah Carey would dress a little more classy,and not like a cheap slut!! she's a role model to many young girls around the world. Please wear a little more clothes!!"
2,This CD is OK...,"The reason so many of the songs on here are old is because they are her number one hits throughout her career. DUH! I mean, read the cover anf then you won't be confused as to why there are older songs! As for the new songs, half of them were good, half of them I didn't like. And I must say MC should wear WAY more appropriate clothing and not scream and wail so many times. Anyway, if you want REALLY good music, listen to Whitney Houston or Celine Dion. They have talent. Mariah's OK, but she's not all that."
4,#1's,"This CD is really 1's!I like the songs very much. Especially ""Whenever You Call"" ""My All"" and ""Emotions"".But if there was ""Merry Christmas"" in this CD,it would be much better.""Merry Christmas"" is one of her best songs I think."
4,"Great but what about ""Breakdown""","Everything about this CD was oh so tight but it was disappointing to not see ""Breakdown"" on this CD which is one of her best in my opinion."
1,Total Junk,"An affront to your ears and intellect. Buy this for your acquaintance who (1) you don't like, or(2) appreciates trash TV. Come on, is this what the 20th Century has come to? Can't we do better than put her at the top of the charts, when there are so many truly great artists out there?"
2,A POOR IDEA AT BEST,"This album of #1 hits was a poor idea at best. The music is all over the place. There are so many different incarnations of Mariah here that it comes across like the roar of an unruly mob. The album lacks any sense of musical cohesion, making listening to it the equivalent of listening to a radio that keeps wandering from station to station as reception wavers and changes. There is some good material here, but her efforts to be ""hip"" and ""street cool"" are disasters. Mariah has talent, there is no argument there, she is even a thoughtful and generous person, but this compilation stinks. Avoid it."
3,Evidence that her songwriting is in decline,"When ""Mariah Carey"" debuted in 1990, it introduced the world to a jazzy singer-songwriter with a knack for soulful, inspirational, and sometimes heart-breaking melodies. ""Vision of Love"", ""Love Takes Time"", ""I Don't Wanna Cry"", and the bouncy ""Someday"" all showed the great potential of the then 20 year-old Carey.Now, several #1 hits later, we have Mariah, pop diva. Her songwriting has deteriorated to the point where many of her songs are starting to sound alike. Take, for example, ""Sweetheart"", ""Honey"", ""Fantasy"", and her new hit ""Heartbreaker"" (from her forthcoming ""Rainbow""). Try listening to these songs back-to-back. You'll be amazed at their similarities.This is a collection that chronicles the declining quality of her songs, and while all of her recent releases may have earned her multi-platinum status, that doesn't mean they're good."
5,Another great snack,"Based on other reviews, I tried these Kavli products. They're great low-fat snacks. These are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between 2.Recommended."
3,International Marketing,"I found this book not to be a hard read as I have heard it was; I did however receive the 11th ed. and not the 15th. But that is what I get for not looking at the editions; instead I looked at the price but I still can get the basic understanding. So I am happy about that! Next time I will watch out for that, the person that sent me my book was on time. I had started my class however give the fact that I didn't send for it until late it made it in good time. I would buy from this seller again."
4,Not as bad as others are saying!,"I purchased this book for an International Marketing course I had to take for my MBA Program. I have to disagree with what I have read about in other reviews - I found this book easy to read, and simple to understand. The examples used help clarify concepts and I felt the book was well organized. I especially liked the Country Notebook section in the back of the book. It was the perfect course-long project to apply the concepts and knowledge we learned about in class. I feel that this book is just about as good as an International Marketing MBA textbook can get!"
1,defective battery,"not as pictured (no labels), would not charge, fit phone too loosely, the two cover pieces are not even sealed closed."
1,"JUNK, do not buy","Junk. Purchased two to replace 8-year-old original batteries, and they performed WORSE. These are NOT Panasonic batteries. This is not the first time I've been stung by generic (""aftermarket"") knock-off batteries. I should have returned them but with shipping cost it's barely worth it."
1,worst movie ever made,"I can normally find at least one thing I like about a movie no matter how bad it is, but this one doesn't fit the bill. If you take out the 'f' word and all the other curse words, as well as the sexual scenes or innuendos, etc, you'd have about 10 minutes of film. I can't believe that someone actually wasted part of his/her life to write this film, and that people actually wanted to act in it. I certainly wasted 2 hours of my life watching it. I don't know why I just didn't turn the film off. But, I kept telling myself that surely it has to get better. Unfortunately, no. I gave it a '1' only because the site wouldn't let me put nothing. But, I give it a '0'."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable,"First off, I'm a big fan of Dane Cook's comedy. The man's a comic genius in my book. This movie didn't disappoint. And Kate Hudson is magnificent! Definitely worth a look and a great choice for a night requiring a good comedic flick that doesn't take much thought...just sit back and relax but be sure to enjoy."
1,The Worst,"The worst mainstream movie that I have ever seen. It is a great premise that probably was pitched well--but the worst possible execution. The jokes are flat, the film quality is poor, the audio is poor."
5,Great step forward for Blof,"Right, they're from the Netherlands, not Norway.In the Netherlands this band is huge already - one of the most popular bands around - but this single is their first big step towards international stardom. They did collaborate with various international musicians like Christina Branco, but working with a band as huge as Counting Crows is great for them.""Holiday in Spain"" (originally written by Counting Crows, with the Dutch parts freely translated by Blof's bass player, Peter Slager) also shows the many similarities between Blof and Counting Crows. One can really hear the influences also more or less present on Blof's previous albums.This makes that these two bands fit together perfectly, even though Adam Duritz' voice differs greatly from that of Paskal Jakobsen. If you're interested in hearing more from Blof, this single is a great introduction."
1,Awful,"I genuinley have a schoolgirl type crush on Ben, but this really is like putting fork on my fillings.Not good.D"
1,nothing like what you expect,"if you are a fan of Ben Folds Five and the incrediable new solo album he just came out with, then you may not like this too much. It doesnt sound anything like any of his other work, and takes some patience to really listen to. I didnt like it at all"
1,UGH. Avoid this album.,"I am one of the biggest Ben Folds fans you will ever find. I can't get enough of his music. And so I decided to buy this CD, the last one of his that I do not have in my collection. WHAT A MISTAKE. This CD is immediately making its way to the trash can, it's not even worth my time to sell it... This CD is NOT the Ben Folds music you have come to love over the years. This CD is comprised of ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC and SPOKEN WORD PIECES (not all spoken by Ben Folds). I don't even think Ben Folds' singing voice shows up once on this entire album, let alone any REAL songs. [...] Avoid this CD if you're a Ben Folds fan. This CD is for electronica/dance lovers."
4,Like these cups,"Like these sippy cups. Great alternative to plastic sippy sups. One complaint(?) - the spout is pretty soft, so my kids love to chew on it. On the flip side, my kids love the cups because the soft spouts also make them very easy to drink from. They only seem to leak if you push on the spout. Durable. Would recommend."
2,"Looks great, but Not Functional","Also have found this sippy fairly non-functional. Unless you get the sippy portion in just right and tighten it extrememly tight, it leaks. So far, we've only been able to use for H2O due to leakage. Does keep stuff cold, but for only 7 oz, does it really matter? It's empty within a few sips. Also an issue is it's weight. My toddler has a bad habit of throwing his sippy's in the car, so with this cup, we've got a dangerous flying projectile. Too bad, b/c we love the concept of a non-plastic thermos."
2,"Stylish, but what good is that with a leaky sippy?","Ok, so the Thermos part of this is cool, and it looks cool. It's nice to be able to keep milk chilled for 5-6 hours.Other than that, this sippy isn't practical. Why, because it leaks and is difficult to clean. Yes, all sippy cups do leak to some degree, but this one is one of the worst that I've experienced (I own 6 different brands). Also, it has no lid or travel sealing disc. So there's no way you can put this in your diaper bag. It's only good around the house if you follow your child around.This is on the back of the shelf and only gets used when all the other cups are dirty. Don't waist your money. Get an Avent sippy cup instead, they work great."
5,Awesome!!,"Being an ardent fan of Michael Jordan, there can be virtually nothing about him that I would not like. But this is an excellent package with Jordan's basketball life summarized in an admirable content. You get all you need to see although however much you get for Jordan, its never enough! It surely makes a great collectibles and a perfect gift."
5,What more can u ask for??,"Man, this dvd set is just incredible. All of Jordan's highlights are on it. And for just under $25, I couldn't believe it. Even though it's only region one(North America) I had to have it. There are Jordan fans in other parts of the world, so make it region free!!!! When I watched his five best games, it just took me back. Come fly me with tells his whole story. Above and Beyond talkes more about the man behind the player. And then you have the top ten moves, assists and buzzer beaters. You have six different movies on it and his 5 best games. Even if it was $100 I would still buy it. This is classic material. A Jordan Fan who doesn't have this is not a complete Jordan fan. Get it!!!!"
4,"Macbook Pro 15"" Case","great product- tight fit- I'm thinking maybe I should of ordered a 17"" sized case. But it's very chic!"
4,Excelente recopilación,"Tiene lo mejor que le hemos escuchado a esta excelente cantante, que con una fuerte base en el Jazz, nos deleita con un pop-fusión latina muy agradable de escuchar....el registro en sí es de muy buena calidad bajos potentes y agudos claros y precisos, la vaoz de basia brilla como nunca."
5,Very Exciting,"The best music I ever listened to in its own right. Soft, smooth jazz, contemporary harmonies, consistently intiricate, and perfect. Oh baby, if you like quality music, well thought out,ever changing non-repetitious...this is it!!Beautiful singing, great bass, great horns, treble piano, great never-ending mixture of rhythms, etc. Well done... sounds great. Covers a wide spectrum of quality music, one after another. In todays terms it leans soft and ballad jazz. Great!"
3,One-Size does not fit all,"Our little girl hates the process of being swaddled and gets hot wrapped in lots of layers, but sleeps so much better when she's wrapped up tight. Thought this would make it easier for me, and harder for her to squirm out of, but at 4 weeks old and 9.5 lbs she's swimming in it. It would be great if the fleece fastening tab were a few inches wider, but as-is it's useless.On the upside, it appears to be well made. It's soft and lightweight, great for summertime."
1,Cute boot--Low quality,This boot has a leather shoe with a stretch man made shaft. The sole is man made rubber and very flexible. Overall this boot is comfortable. But don't buy these if you want to wear them. The heel of the boot became detached the first time I wore these. Not the quality you expect from a Clark.
1,Comfortable but cheap quality!,"I bought these boots from a retailer besides Amazon. They are great looking boots, very comfortable after wearing all day, but the quality is terrible! One of the seams on the front right side of the boot just ripped all the way down after wearing maybe 5 times! Definitely not what you would expect from Clarks!"
2,"after reading SISTERIA, this was a bore","I read Sue Margolis' second novel, sisteria months back before I grabbed a copy of neurotica and well, I was sorely disappointed. Sisteria was much more enjoyable and hilarious and definitely a gripping read. Read that instead. I commend Mrs Margolis on her sucessful writing career."
2,I just couldn't get into this one.,"I tend to enjoy British novels--Bridget Jones' Diary, High Fidelity, Jemima J, etc.--but I just couldn't get into this one. I think the main reason for this is that I found the characters to be unlikable and too over the top; I just never really related to Anna and Dan, both of whom I found to be whiney and annoying. Also, Margolis over-uses metaphors to the point of ridiculousness--a good example is the ""wooly mamouth"" quote in the editorial review above. I think that this is supposed to be raunchy British wit, but I just found it to be stupid and not at all funny, unlike the other British books I've read. Perhaps fans of Benny Hill-type humor will enjoy this one, but it just wasn't for me."
4,"Fluffy, erotic, and funny","This is NOT great literature, but it is great fun. Essentially an old-fashioned sex farce, if it weren't for a couple of brief references to computers, this would seem much more a Seventies book than a Nineties book.Get a book cover so your cultured friends don't know you're reading it, and then enjoy."
3,An O.K. Read,"Neurotica is a story about a lady who just isn't satisfied. From there you can guess that it is about how she ""tries"" to find satisfaction. Interesting tale that you can guess the ending of during the first 30 pages. But, entertaining."
2,"But, wait, she gets better","I did not like this book at all. I bought it because this author wrote another book called ""Spin Cycle"" I LOVED ""Spin Cycle."" It was great, so I thought I'd like this too. It just wasn't what I expected.But ""Spin Cycle"" was her second book, so the author is improving."
2,Disappointed,Too many extra characters with no purpose to the story. The tone and the the occasional wit don't make up for a story that isn't finessed to the end.
4,Wickedly funny!,I found this book to be wickedly funny and raunchy as hell. It's well written and the characters come alive for the reader. The sexual liason scenes are hysterical. Not for the prudish or those who are easily offended.
2,"""World Cultures"" more of a world history","I teach 7th grade world cultures and was given this book as my classroom text. I found the text to be very informative but the title is very misleading. Rather than a classroom text on world cultures it was more of a in depth analysis of world history. It failed to include everyday cultural activities such as clothing, habits, beliefs (outside of religion) and everyday life. Too much of each chapter was focused on ancient history without connecting the culture to the modern world."
2,Yikes! Not even good enough for a grade schooler.,"I had high hopes for this book, which promises to show you how to use color and other design principles to make more effective presentation slides.But the slide examples are terrible! Yellow text on a purple background? Cheesy clip art? These all look like BEFORE slides from the 1990's. No professional would ever present slides that look this bad. Look at the book's cover. That's the most attractive visual you'll find in this entire book.Even my grade school daughter looked at the pages and recoiled in horror, crying ""Are these supposed to be GOOD slides?"". Can you imagine the impression these slides would leave with executives and prospective clients?There are a few useful tips but they are buried in so many bad slide examples I cannot bear to give this book more than 2 stars."
3,Not as good as the original,I was really looking forward to seeing this movie; I loved the original (Hera Pheri) and expected this one to be even funnier.Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. Whereas Hera Pheri relied on some very humorous situation comedy; Phir Hera Pheri was a slapstick comedy. Very different from the original and not nearly as funny. I think I might have cracked a smile a few times but that was it.I hear Akshay Kumar was involved in the editing of this film which doesn't surprise me; he clearly has more scenes than Suniel or Paresh. I wouldn't be surprised if some of Suniel's and Paresh's best moments ended up on the cutting room floor.Hopefully the sequel returns to the humor I enjoyed in the original.
4,picture perfect,I have needed this book for some time for my food web lesson. Very glad to have it. The students enjoyed it also.
4,Beautiful singing and sappy strings,"Speaking about arrangements, this album might have been completely according to Joe Williams' tastes; he liked strings and ballads...And he does sing it nicely (actually, much better than wonderful Sarah Vaughan in similar circumstances, at least in my opinion).But, compared to Joe'w work in more jazzy environments, it's just not making him live up to his potential... He is such a great jazz singer!Well, if you're into conservative, romantic ballads, this is an album for you..."
2,One of the Cult's worst.,"One Canadian critic called this is favourite BOC album. The only thing I can say is that I disagree wholeheartedly. Easily the most unfocused songwriting-wise, teetering on the edge between raw and intellectual (like pre-1976 BOC) and polished (like Mirrors and Agents of Fortune), Cultosaurus Erectus is just not a very exciting listen, the only moment of energy coming with the lyrically dumb but at least lively ""The Marshall Plan"". The rest is mostly an uneasy marriage of keyboard and guitar, plus a lot of ""strangeness for strangeness' sake"". I expected much more from the album that sits squarely between the positive, bright sheen of 1979's Mirrors and the soaring, hook-filled pop-metal of 1981's Fire of Unknown Origin. Don't make this your first Blue Oyster Cult album -- it'll give you a false, fickle impression of this brilliant, if erratic band. Best for BOC fans who want a complete picture of the band's output."
5,Can listen to this over and over again,Timeless quality. Never tire of the melodies and the musicality. The band is tight. No weaknesses. Just great solid rock and roll the BOC way.
5,CLASSIC BOC AT IT'S FINEST!!!!,"Ranking second only to ""imaginos"", this album is spectacular. It contains ""Black Blade"", which is their greatest song ever. The other highlights include ""Deadline"", ""Lips in the hills"" & ""the marshall plan."" Definetly worth the price!"
4,The mini-series picks up!,"I was worried about what the ten-book mini-series was going to be like after reading no 45, which wasn't half as good as I expected it to be. But this book was a huge improvement. There was a lot of fighting, but somehow it seemed to return to the quality of the old Animorph books, even though it was short. Ax's previous books have made me dislike him slightly; he seemed more and more arrogant. This book has changed my mind about him, showing why he has always been so careful before to not interfere in human matters, and the terrible choice he had to make. The ending was brillant and echoed parts of the Hork-Bajir Chronicles, especially. The book didn't change so much from the-war-with-the-Yeeks point of view, but it changed Ax's friendship with the Animorphs completely. One of the best Ax books recently!"
3,Another fine quote.,"A great gift for any Laurel & Hardy fan. It consists of biographical sketches of the pair, an account of their careers, a complete list of their movies, plenty of excellent photographs and - what gives the series its title - a fine selection of quotes. It is certainly not a definitive biography but its 80 pages include some interesting trivia. Diehard fans will appreciate it for that and for the illustrations."
2,Jammed Slot,"It was good for a week, but than the slot that counts the money got jammed and now it won't count the money."
1,money jar,"Our money jar broke after the first use. It's cheaply made and not worth the trouble. Its spring mechanism broke at the count of 76.00. I can't return it since I threw away the receipt, so I think we are stuck with a very expensive plastic jar!"
3,Czech:a Complete Course for Beginners,"It depends on why you wish to learn Czech.If it's for a good grounding in grammar and to be able to read Czech literature, then this book is fine.If you're learning, as I am, for holiday purposes, then it's not much use.I shall be travelling alone, and I need to be able to ask about hotels, trains and buses,local sights,to order meals, to change money.This book is no use for that at all. The audio cassette is very difficult to follow at first, as the speech is so rapid. I know all the arguments for presenting it in this way, but when there are new and very difficult sounds to master we need more help.The r/s sound is a beast. I've got it, but no thanks to this course."
3,Assumes a person learns everything at first glance!,I found a simple dictionary that showed how to pronounce each word in English. This book assumes a person learns the pronounciation of words throughout the text by reading the front of the book. The book needs to show the phrases throughout the book so that a person is not always trying to dig back to figure out how to pronounce a word or phrase in English. Czech does not look like at easy language to learn.
3,"Nice film - not great, not awful","This is a good, family-friendly film with strong Christian values throughout. It lacks some depth, but does have several scenes that openly include prayer and Scripture reading. The main plot points follow the book relatively well. However, they did mess with a couple of things - 1) the daughter, Missy, is considerably older than she is in the book, making it necessary to tailor the story a bit to make the character fit; 2) - spoiler alert - they changed the ending. I won't tell you how, exactly, but they definitely tried to rev up the drama.Some of the acting is clunky (Theresa Russell shows ZERO warmth or humor as Ma Graham, and Skye Bartusiak hasn't quite hit her stride here), and the dialog at some points can get a little slow. It did bother me a bit that the actors seemed to have difficulty creating sparks between Marty & Clark.Overall, though, it is a nice, wholesome alternative to all the junk on regular TV!"
3,This one is the best one out of the entire series,"This movie is pretty good. The main problem I had with it, was that they use the Lord's name in vain a few times (and continue to do so throughout the rest of the series). Most people will not care about this, but I know some Christians (like myself) may be disappointed over it. The acting and some of the lines were pretty cheesy, but overall sweet. The little girl, Missy, is quite bratty. Her character has such an attitude, that it was just plain annoying. She softens up to Marty half way through though. Yes, the story is predictable, but if you're not too picky and can appreciate the little things in life, this will be just enough to keep you entertained all the way through. I've seen the rest of the series, and this first one is as good as it gets. It's mediocre good."
4,Good family film,"Directed by Michael Landon Junior this movie tells the story of Marty a young bride who is left widowed after the accidental death of her husband. In a strange town she is unable to return to her parents, so accepts the offer to marry from Clark, another widow who has a nine-year-old daughter Missy. She agress to stay through the winter - he agrees that if she is still unhappy he will pay to send her home to her parents.A lovely family film with a good story which flows well and doesn't get bogged down with boring parts.Don't forget to watch the sequel called ""Love's Enduring Promise""."
5,"Romantic, family-friendly--a must-have!","This is one of the best movies Hallmark has produced. Film combines a great love story, inspiration, and family values. Katherine Heigl and Dale Midkiff have great chemistry! This is the best of the entire series. ORDER IT!"
1,Does not live up to book,"I was very disappointed with the movie. I love the whole 'Love Comes Softly' series, but I don't feel the movie did it any justice. Changing the age of Missy from a toddler to a preteen completely changes the whole feel of the story. I would not recommed buying this at all. Just stick to the book, it is much better."
4,Endearing but Too Religiously Preachy,"Endearing film and the starter to the equally endearing Love... series.Be forewarned that this series is faith-based, replete with a heavy emphasis on Christian beliefs. I wasn't aware of this before I watched; although, 'written by Michael Landon, Jr.' should have been a tipoff to me. So if you are not religious you may find the repeated references to God, bible, and religion tough to take. Several times I utilized my fast forward button to get me through some of the more over-the-top preachy dialogue.But putting religion aside, the movie's wholesome focus on love and family is refreshing. So much of our society is sex and violence centric. It is refreshing to take a look back at how life used to be before our society became uncontrollably warped by the crudeness of drugs, greed and lust. It makes me almost willing to give up modern conveniences if we could go back to life as it was back then-- minus the social injustices suffered by women and ethnic groups."
5,Great romantic movie!!!,Thanks Michael Landon Jr. for putting out good wholesome movies. I am looking forward to more movies in the future.
4,Good family video,"The story of Marty and Clark is a good one as seen in the movie, and definately one I would not mind my children seeing (as I am very, very strict with what they can and cannot see). However, I must say I was very dissapointed with the movie, for while the movie itself is very good, it strays dramatically from the author's original writing of the book, ""Love Comes Softly."" I felt that as a Christian-based book, the movie should have followed suit. It only vaguely gives a viewer idea of Christianity."
5,THIS MOVIE IS TOPS IN MY BOOK,"Love Comes Softly is one of the BEST DVD films I have ever seen. The characters are outstanding, scenery magnificent, and music uplifting. I thoughly enjoyed this film, seeing it 5 times already! I highly recommend this film for all age groups!!"
2,"Clichés, clichés and more chlichés","I seem to be in the minority here, but I found this movie very overrated. The story is standard romance formula 1A, with some discussions about faith thrown in to please Christian viewers. It's extremely predictable and never feels authentic. The movie has nothing to offer that we haven't seen a hundred times before. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichés since ""Blonde Ambition"".The acting is also weak, and having also seen ""The Last Sin Eater"", which also had very bad performances, even by talented actors, I'm starting to suspect Michael Landon doesn't know how to get good performances out of his cast.Recommended only for die-hard fans of sappy made-for-TV dramas."
3,Good movie,"The movie was good, but fans of the Love Comes Softly series by Jannette Oke will be dissapointed. The movie made Missie, who was supposed to be 2, 10. They changed the baby's name from Claridge to Aaron. They also changed many of the other major plot points in the book. Fans of the book: disreguard the book when watching the movie, or you'll be dissapointed."
1,All Reviews on this page are incorrect!,"All of these reviews seem to be for the Denver, Colorado group Mass Confusion. After listening to the sound clips on this page I can tell you this is not Colorado's Mass confusion. Beware when you order this cd it will not be the Colorado Mass Confusion but some california rap group."
1,These speakers Suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These Speakers Suck balls. I don't even have an amp running them and they blew in less than a week. I never even turned them up to the max. Save you time and money, these speakers Blow, Literally."
1,can't learn from it,This cd isnt' good to learn from. Many of the applications are incorrect. The quality of the kung fu is at a beginner's level. Some of the techniques are wrong and you may hurt yourself praticing it the way shown on the cd.
2,Cheap and inaccurate,"Bought this to help with sharpening and honing of chisels and plane irons. Big disappointment. Lack of a positive indexing system makes the duplication of angles very difficult. Each sharpening job includes lots of back and forth adjusting of angle, getting the light right, looking for light under bevel, etc until you think you have it right. Much to your dismay, when you begin sharpening in earnest, this eyeball method usually leaves you off enough to necessitate much more sharpening than you should have to do. This device has not saved me any time. I must admit, however, that any fixed angle results in a better cutting edge than what I can achieve by hand. I am not a gifted sharpener, so I have trouble with some 'rounding' or skewing when sharpening by hand. This jig has at least given me some very sharp tools, but 3 chisels and one plane iron took this perfectionist about 4 hrs to get sharp."
1,Mariah Carey is finished,"I have never heard something this ear-grating in my life, a subdued, outrageously boring and overlong remake of a terrific 80's song (one of my favorites) that is performed with none of the feel the original had. It is obvious that Carey's carrer is in jeopardy, and apparently the execs who hold the checks over her head have opted to hop on the nostalgic bandwagon to cash in on radio kids' inabilities to recognize good art. ""Miss You"" is almost impossible to sit through. Total pop trash for people who wouldn't mind spending their allowance money on a sippy-cup coaster, which I'm sure this single will become within the next month or so."
2,Queens and Crescents,"I had trouble with the storyline of this book. The author took the hero on a journey to find the love of his life, only to loose her in the end. I think the story should have stopped here, it would have been a fine tragedy. However, the author adds more. I will stop here so, I don't give away the entire plot.Rita@ritalsmith.com"
1,"small tulips, $8.99 value at stop and shop",I sent these to my mom and mother in law so it was just the thought that counts however these tulips were much less than expected. It has the value of 8.99 at the flower store for $30 shipped.
1,Grower's Choice doens't look anything like that,"Boyfriend ordered Grower's Choice bouquet for me for Valentine's Day. The resulting bouquet was all filler stalks, broken stems, and no shape. You might find this combo for $6, except this is exactly the combination I'd ever buy because it's ugly. Talk about a massively disappointing V-day. I cried on opening the box, which I'm pretty sure was not his intention."
2,You get what you pay for,"This tool is just not accurate enough for woodworking. If you want to make acurate miters, bevels, etc., you're going to have to bite the bullet and buy a much more expensive tool. We're talking a hunderd bucks more expensive. If you need a protractor for lower precision work, like framing, splurge and get one that isn't made of plastic. If this thing cost any more it would have only gotten one star."
3,"sounds like an old, very worn cassette","Shredding, but this would been a much cooler album if the sound quality wasn't so horrible...that and it sounds too improvised (except the last track). The track ""Time is the Enemy"", however, is as perfect as they come - if they'de recorded 5 more tracks like that (preferably in the studio), I'd have given the album 5 stars."
4,Good RAM fan,"Runs great but a little loud. Of course, I have 7 fans in my case not including this one or the video card fan or mobo fan, but it could use quieter fans. Keeps my RAM nice and cool regardless of noise."
3,Performance and Silence,"Good product... but... It cannot be firmly placed... the ""just put it there"" system could be a little uncomfortable... Before buying it ask yourself ""Do I really need it?""... I didn't."
2,fan sucks,fan sucks all 3 fans no sqell on start up only last a month what the deal with that you expect it to be good it's corsair.
1,Pure Hype,"Very disappointing. I also use a Braun razor. This product improved glide slightly. It did not improve shave closeness at all, even with repeated passes. And the smell is quite unpleasant. Conclusion: incredibly overpriced and ineffective. I can get equal benefit by simply applying a thin layer of aloe vera before shaving. That costs less than a penny an application and is beneficial to the skin. For me, this was a complete waste of money."
1,not recommended,"Many of Billy Jealousy's products are really great. Not this one. It creats such a drag on the electric razor that's it's a real impediment to a good shave. It makes the skin sticky and creates friction, no matter how much or little is used. Best= Williams pre-shave or talc. Don't waste your $."
4,"Great game, easy play.","Lots of fun to play and many different characters.Cons: becomes a bit repetitive.Overall, still a great game."
4,Bring back the Republic!,Show your support for our old nemesis in this sturdy t-shirt with durable printed letters.
3,Still Trying!!,"Haven't quite gotten into it yet. The subject facinates me. Usually have several books going at once.This one my heavy read, will get back to it."
3,A Few Interesting Items of Information But Mainly Mormon Propaganda,"I bought this book to find out more about the life history of Mary the mother of Jesus. I understand that not much documented history is known about her but was looking for a book that would pull together from various sources what is known. The book did offer some interesting new information I didn't previously know, basing it largely on logical suppositions from known Jewish traditions of that era. Unfortunately, the book was also thinly disguised Morman propaganda to impose that religion's version of Mary on non-Morman readers."
1,Is this for real?,"I mean, c'mon - SHELLFISH AND SHUBERT?!?!?!? I can't even believe this was released. If this isn't the last nail in the American cultural coffin, I can't imagine what is.Oy vey."
2,Constant Struggle- Mystic Roots,"Pass the marijuana is simply the gayest song I have ever heard in my life. I listened to that off of a mix a friend had and I thought it was a song he made on his computer, it sucks. Don't let any fake reggae fans fool you."
1,10 degree Bevel Router Bit,The picture in the add does not have a bevel on it. Is this a 10 degree bevel bit or not?
3,The Best of Joe's Solo Work,"This is as good a slice of the guitar according to Joe as you're likely to find. Sans his nemesis/partner Tyler, Joe forged ahead with this solo effort at a time when he was still coherent enough to work. The enthusiasm more than makes up for the erratic songwriting, and some of the tunes (""Conflict of Interest,"" ""Ready on the Firing Line,"" and particularly ""Discount Dogs"") would've made fine Aerosmith songs. For the record, I never liked Tyler's screwing up of the title track, yet it continues to be a part of their live act to this day. Check out the exhilirating bit of guitar work on ""Break Song."" If you enjoy Perry's work on early Aerosmith albums, and even today, you'll enjoy this. Maximum volume is necessary."
2,Just bad.,"If vocals on rock songs didn't matter, this would be good album. Unfortunately as soon as the singing starts (whether its the rent-a-singer that was hired, or Joe himself) this is no better than a million high school start up bands. Did the label fund this or did Joe use some of his millions to keep this dead horse alive?"
4,Great Stuff from a guy who doesnt get much credit,"well first I want to say Eddie and his band doesnt get enough credit for their tunes. this album is a great one. from the tracks ""The Wish"" and to others as ""Get A Move On"" the last track ""Million Dollar Girl"" are all good driving songs. and as always his voice is ever amazing. people ask me how I get into this kind of music because im pretty young. I tell them well this is when music was music and when it was done for the pure enjoyment and the fun of just writing and making records. and they always say back yeah you're right. I looked for this album for a looong time and finally got it off ebay for yah 22 bucks but well worth it. if your a fan of this group then if you see it somewhere pick it up bc its out of print. so grab it and spin it. keep rockin."
2,continous odor,"Bought this, set it up and immediatele noticed a srong plastic odor. I let it run for about 8 hrs.Turned it on the next day and the odor was sdtill there.Even a family member noticed it.I changed the water, rinsed the filter, to no avail.3 days later it was still smelling. You noticed it the minute you entered the room, atrong plastic smell.Awful.Sent it back.I noticed a few other people had the same comlpaint. Too bad, other than that it was fine.I have NO idea why it smelled so awful."
4,"2 Seasons, Still Great!","We just finished our second winter season with this humidifier. It is a great humidifier and is very quiet. It can be difficult to clean, there are a lot of nooks and nannies but I find that to be true with all humidifiers I have owned in the past. I usually can get two nights out of one tank but the bedroom we use it in is smaller than your average bedroom - think glorified NYC closet."
1,Disappointing humidifier,"The one I had left puddles of water on the floor when running. When the tank had to be removed for filling, it was not possible to remove it without dripping water on the floor. Tank was also quite small and had to be filled more than twice a day to humidify a small room. All in all didn't work right, and I returned it. Got a Venta warm air humidifier with electronic switches and indicators from another vendor which I am quite happy with. For some reason the price from Amazon for the Venta humidifier is much higher than it was elsewhere, and I fail to understand why Amazon quote such a high price to begin with---quite a contrast from their normal low prices."
2,It leaks...,"I bought this humidifier after reading many reviews. I noted some customers had problems with leakage but I was hoping that I would not be part of the unlucky group (which seemed to be a minority).Unfortunately, the humidifier does leak. You can only put 1/2 glass of water at the time so that the liquid does not go up to the blue plastic level, where the leakage happens. So it runs out of steam fast. Otherwise it works fine, but still it is just ok for what I need it for, and I am disappointed. I would have bought a much slimmer and simpler model, had I not been swayed by other reviews from customers who did not have the problem. For me, this humidifer is not worth spending the money, not at all. I did not mind the looks although it is ugly, but I do mind that it is not performing."
1,Watch for cracks near the transducer plate - this will cause a leak.,"You never know when you read a review if the person leaving it is just dumb or if they had an issue you're likely to encounter yourself. I might well be dumb, but it doesn't take too many smarts to realize that if there's a crack in the white plastic around the transducer plate (which is underwater), you're going to have a leak. It also doesn't take a genius to realize that the plastic surrounding a metal plate that is vibrating at ultrasonic frequencies might be prone to cracking.Long story short: If you buy this, run it inside a dish that can hold about twice the volume of water in the tank above. I got a crack within the first 3 hours, but it could happen to yours at any time."
2,Can't open it after a year,I purchased this a year ago. Over time the water fill hole becomes extremely hard to open. I made the mistake of letting my husband fill it one night and he over-tightened it. Now it's useless to us! We can't refill it! It's impossible to open.
4,Mrs.,It is a good product especially for a dry winter day. It keep me go to sleep comfortably through the night.
2,Was Ok but...,"I liked this machine...till it quit working. It was quiet, was easy to fill (although you do have to be careful so you don't spill it). The machine developed a crack in the bottom portion and it never worked properly after that. I should have returned it under warranty, but had some personal issues during that time and never got around to it. I am looking to purchase a new humidifier now but won't be going with this brand/model."
3,"Good product, iffy electronics.","For the first few days this product pumped out volumes of steam without issue or noise.Then about a week later I noticed a distinct 'clicking' at night when running it in 'heat mode' and at 100% humidityevery few seconds the device would shut off and turn back on.I set it to cool mist and it would still do it. The green light would blink on and off and the steam would come out in bursts...I realized that I could hear a distinct humming coming from inside, so I turned the dial down to 75%. Still large volumes of steam but no more power cycling...I've debated returning it, but it works at 75% just fine... I just hope it doesn't stop working at 75% next..."
1,Returned two of these that did not function properly,"The first unit worked for about a week and a half, then stopped producing mist. Everything else still seemed to function, including the somewhat noisy fan. I requested a replacement that was handled extremely well by Amazon.The replacement arrived and I found the mist control did not function as I expected, like on the original unit. Turning the control all the way down still produced quite a bit of mist. Turning it all the way up produced only a little more. The fan on this replacement unit was also a bit noisy. Everything else functioned as expected.I ended up returning this unit for a refund. Again, Amazon handled this extremely well.I ordered the Venta 205 from Amazon. After a month of use, all is well. The fan makes very little noise, unlike the SPT."
5,Great humidifier,"I've gone through probably 4 or 5 humidifiers in the last 10 years, and this is by far the best unit I've ever owned. Here are the issues I've had with previous humidifiers that are solved by this particular humidifier:1. The mist it creates is very fine, which seems to translating into the moisture staying in the air and not collecting on the windows.2. I haven't had any mold build up in the unit, even after 2 months of use.3. This unit takes up very little space on my dresser -- I've got a towel underneath it just in case but I haven't had any water leak out so far.As described in other reviews here, there is a misting plate instead of the wicking material used more commonly in humidifiers. I use the cool mist setting unless I am sick, which is when I turn on the warmer mist -- both settings work fine."
2,very noisy humidifier,"I bought this humidifier because it had good reviews. The one I received became very noisy after the first or second night of usage. It makes a chopping sound, like a helicopter, maybe just a bit less loud. I will have to get a different brand. What is good about it is the lack of slimy deposit. This might be at least partially due to the fact that I am using filtered water. I don't have the ""white dust"" on the furniture either that people often complain about when they use plain tap water. I cannot consider this to be a good product because of the annoying noise."
3,"Works well, poor design","I've used this product for 3 months almost nightly and it works well and as advertised, but is poorly designed for refilling. It is necessary to unscrew the filter in order to fill the tank, and the filter does not unscrew easily, even though I try not to screw it on too tightly. Unlike other humidifiers, it does not emit any warning when it runs out of water: it just shuts itself off, which is a very nice feature. The dual-mist emitter swivels in order to direct the mist properly. Cleaning is easy and straightforward."
3,Good Humidifier with Reservations,I have had this unit for 3 years now. The steam output is very good for this size unit.My unit leaked also BUT only because I tried cleaning the pipe that connects one side of the tank to the other with a little brush. I believe all the leaks for this unit come from this pipe because the pipe uses silicone for the parts that bend (dont know what its called). I opened the unit and and saw that the leak was because of little holes in that silicone part. My holes were created of my attempt to clean it with the brush but yours might just happened because the silicone got porous. I fixed the leaks by applying a little insulation gel I got from Home Depot. My unit performs without leaks now.Note on opening the unit: There are 4 screws on the bottom of the unit that need to be removed. 2 are simple Philips head screw but the other 2 are Robertson screws which need a specific screw driver which you can get at Home Depot.Hope this helps.
5,SPT su-4010 humidifier.,This may be small but it sure puts out some moisture. In no time at all we could finally touch things in the house without creating a lighten bolt.
4,worth it,no problems. works as advertised. i do recomend this product as a safe bet for it's use. nice and quiet too.
5,Worth every penny,"Very easy to use, just wished I didnt have to refill the water tank every day. Mainly used the cool humidifier."
3,Very Noisy,"My husband can't seep at night because of this, it it too noisy and it does not stop even if I put it on low."
1,Pleased...then not so much,"Bought this humidifier to keep the bedroom comfortable during the winter months. It has a lot of great features, like the warm mist and dual-facing outflow nozzles so you can get more coverage.After reading the instructions (some humidifiers are touchy), I placed it on a flat, non-absorbant surface as recommended. This product worked GREAT the first time I used it.The next day, I filled it up the next day and left for work, hoping to return to a much less dry home when I got back. What I returned to was water all over the bedroom floor, because the humidifer had decided to dump it's contents right out of the bottom.I buy from Amazon religiously, and rarely have a problem with any of their items, but I can say for certain - between mine and others' negative experiences with this product, they should stop carrying it until some serious quality control issues are fixed.Returned for refund."
1,Defective and never got a replacement,"Received humidifier within a week. Filled it up, plugged it in but it never worked. Light came on but no mist came out and bottle was still full 3 days later. I requested replacement via Amazon.com. Shipped back old (broken) one and was informed new one (replacement) shipping out immediately. Over 3 weeks later and after 3 calls because I never received replacement, I finally requested a refund from Amazon."
2,Clunker,"Apparently I received one of the clunkers--not once but twice. I have the feeling I rec'd refurbished ones in both cases. It was loud and the operation was inconsistent. Customer service was good though. I called the number and talked to a human first time. They sent a ""new"" base and I did not return the old one until I was sure the ""new"" one worked which did not fully work.Additionally, there is very little range and control of mist output in terms of distance and amount.Bottom line: You get what you pay for. I returned everything and bought the Air-O-Swiss AOS 7145 which so far I am near ecstatic over."
4,great so far,"no problems, very quiet as advertised. only had for 1 month but so far would recommend again"
4,SPT SU-4010 Humidifier,It does the job in a 14'X14' room putting out sufficient moisture and I found it easy to fill and adjust.
1,SPT Su 4010 Ultrasonic Dual Mist Humidifier,Received the above humidifier and used it the first night. It worked fine. The very next day the heater setting for warm mist would not work. This is a record for a usage for a new product. It lasted only one day.I am returning it to Amazon for a full refund. When packing up this return I saw a packing list on the box. It had already been returned to the company and they reshipped a defective product to me as brand new. Bad practice!!Forget buying from SPT
4,Met my expectations,"The humidifier is extremely quiet and that's really important, cause that's what its purpose is. Easy to operate and fits nicely on a stand near my bed. I can't turn the force of the mist down enough. It's really high and it would be better if I could make it lower. Because it's high, I have the fill it every other day....last one I had (different make) had a larger reservoir and needed to be filled less often. Only other issue is the green light that appears when it's turned on. It's very bright and lights up my bedroom so I put a bandaid over it to lesson the light. while it's nice to know it's on, a dimmer light would function better.Still all in all I do like it so I rated it 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Stopped working after 4 days,"It worked great for a few days, then it just stopped. Very frustrating. The ions come out of the filter, perhaps they go into the motor and wreck it. Just a poor design."
4,Great for the Casual Nature Fan,"Great general reference guide with photos by renowned insect photographer Dr. Edward Ross. A well done eighty-three page introduction covers such topics as classification, anatomy, behavior and collecting. Not for real die hards as the number of species is limited. Great though for students, naturalists, nature photographers and others interested in a good general introduction that uses top quality photography."
4,son says it is better than the current seat,"Writing this for my son, who says this seat is more comfortable than the seat that came with the Trek bike."
5,Super seat,"This seat is great. It does a exactly what is says it will do. Very comfortable seat, I would recomend it."
5,This seat really is AWESOME!!!,"I never write reviews, but this seat deserves one. I am a 6ft tall 235 pound 38 year old guy. Now I'm not a fat guy, I'm just a big ole side of beef. This seat feels endlessly better than the 2 seats I tried before this one. I haven't ridden a bicycle in 20 years and I thought it would be cool to get back into it. Well it turns out I don't have a brand new ass anymore and the stock seat was killing me. I traded up (I thought) to a diamond backDiamondback Urban Pro SeatDJ seat. It was very nearly as bad as the stock seat. I mean every damn time I sat down my sit bones just plain HURT. I just received this new saddle and it makes a WORLD of difference. No more pain in the ass and I'm not afraid to sit down anymore. And IT'S CHEAP!! I should have bought a couple of them for when this one wears out."
3,Not as comfortable as I hoped,"I've been searching for a saddle that doesn't ""rub me the wrong way"" and thought this would do the trick. It looks like a great design but just doesn't work as well as I had hoped it would. Build quality is average, the decals start wearing off pretty quick, the foam starts to collapse after a couple rides, and I was going numb faster on this saddle than almost everything else I've tried up to this point. Returned item and ordered a saddle made by Selle Royal that does a better job but still not 100% happy with it either."
4,"Comfortable seat, great price",Swapped this for the low-budget seat that came with my low-priced bike and I couldn't be happier. I've recently returned to riding after decades and my sit bones weren't very padded and this seat has allowed me to triple my mileage without pain.
4,"Yes, this is comfortable","I needed a new seat, checked reviews which said that this is comfortable, and have to report that it is.Amazing how much of a difference a seat can make.I am totally satisfied, but hesitate to award 5 stars to a seat."
4,Bicycle Seat for Prostate,"I bought this for my father whom had extensive prostate surgery and problems for over a few years. He is an above average cyclist and would still like to cycle in club rides ranging from 25 to 70 miles. He is in his 70s. His feedback was fairly positve. The seat is comfortable with nice padding and the cut out area certainly helps relieve prostate pressure. If designed again, or perhaps a different model number, he would suggest to widen the cut out area another 1/2"" and widen the entire seat another 3/4"". It might be nice to make a seat that made reference to ""those who had prostate surgery"". Overall rating an 8.5 out of 10."
5,A nice switch from my old seat,"As a casual mountain bike rider, I've found the seat to be very comfortable which contributes to much more pleasurable rides. I don't care for the cheaply affixed label, but the seat is easy to install and well made."
3,Only one small box ~,The product is good but only one small box. just be aware of that when you place the order..You can buy this similar product in walmart with cheaper price.FYI...
4,Admirable Restraint.....Wrenching Drama,"Everyone knew how this one would come out, but it was still one of the most emotionally wrenching movies I've ever seen. The theater was absolutely silent as the story of the 4th hijacked plane on September 11 ended with a blackened screen as United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field near Schwenksville, PA. The use of unknown actors (including some actual participants at the various air and defense command centers) along with admirable dramatic restraint (the famous ""let's roll"" is whispered) by the director combine to put the viewer right in the middle of the most infamous day in recent history."
4,A Great Movie,"I think that this is a sensitive subject that was greatly depicted in United 93. I think this is not only a great movie, but it is also one of the only 9/11 movies that I believe was done carefully and correct."
2,Chip out,"I am using this blade on my basic Dewalt 10"" Mitre Saw and when cutting Maple I get a really smooth front side cut but I am experienceing quite a bit of chip out on the backside. I also get some chip out on the side which is really unacceptable."
2,"Same old, same old, same old","I bought this book because I had the 1990-91 Edition and wanted updated information. I found the 2001 material to be so similar it was laughable. The base cities are the same, the excursions were the same, the 'how to' information was identical to the edition ten years earlier. I found little if anything to be new, fresh, or informative. The book was a huge disappointment."
3,Generously cut,Get a size smaller than you normally wear. The cut is quite generous. I was swimming in the Large I ordered using the company sizing guidelines.
2,Starting Perturbations,"This is a nice place to start when learning basic perturbation methods. There are numerous examples and the material is clearly presented. However, there are weak points. One is brevity, as pointed out by the first reviewer. The coverage of the subject of perturbation methods is minimal and some of the topics that are covered are done so with little depth. Another drawback is the emphasis, when discussing applications, on fluids and to a lesser extent mechanics. This makes it somewhat old fashioned. The greatest drawback is the exercises. It is impossible to learn mathematics, and perturbation methods in particular, without doing lots of problems. This text, unfortunately, falls far short in the number and range of problems it provides the reader."
2,Altec Lansing fails to impress here,"I was disappointed in these headphones. The audio quality in and out is decent for the price but a few disadvantages should make you look elsewhere for your headset.1. Comfort: The floating speaker design doesn't work as well as one might hope. The set gets uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. Maybe more padding would have helped.2. 3-D?: When I turned the feature on things seemed to sound a bit better but I'd hesitate to call it 3-D. Not really worth touting. It sounds more like a gain setting than 3-D.3. Inconvenience: The ""3-D"" module, which resides mid-line and has a built-in volume control, needs a AA battery to operate. This battery also seems to powers the mic. So if the battery dies... no microphone and no 3-D effect. At least that's how mine seems to work, or rather, not work.Keeping in mind the old adage ""You get what you pay for."", these are not horrible, but were I you, I'd spend a few more bucks and go up a rung in quality."
4,If only,"I enjoy the ability to add zoom to a non-SLR camera. I have backpacked the Tour de France 3 times and could not afford the weight and size of an SLR rig along with a video camera. My Canon S1 was perfect...except for podium shots where the zoom was maxed. This lens isn't amazing, but will add more power - and it may be enough for you to justify its price (and the fact that it makes the camera HUGE). I'm taking this one to NY this weekend for a trial run.My only regret? You cannot add a snap-on/secure lens cap as it has no threading. And IF IT WERE ONLY METAL!"
2,Mike's review of carwash,Totally unrealistic. Whomever designed this toy has apparently never visited a carwash. Wash function didn't operate properly and made a mess by splashing water all over. My 3 year old grandson preferred another similar carwash that he received over this one - doesn't even play with it.
2,Not what I expected,"I returned this item. It is in no way worth the $27 I paid for it. It is very very small - maybe a customer error, but I expected a much larger toy. My suggestion, if you find it cheaper - probably okay, if not, spend your $30 on something else."
4,"Great, but could be better","An excellent collection from the most beautiful and sensuous voice the world has ever heard. However, a little short, and not enough from her later period. Still excellent and beautiful, but it makes you want more!"
2,Not very satisfied,"I've had this stroller for a little over a month and haven't been happy with it. It is heavier and bulkier than I expected and it is very difficult to open up. Additionally, it squeaks constantly every time I use it. I'm currently trying to return and exchange it."
5,I Love It.! Great product and great service.,"I am a new mom and this is my first and only stoller. I love this stroller. I have the matching carseat and they work well together. The stroller actually fits in the trunk of my Mustang, and that really is amazing. It is great. I do agree with other reviews that the basket is small but, if you want a compact stroller that is what you get. Also the folding/canopy is designed badly. When you fold it the wheels rub on the pink canopy and get it dirty. I solved the by cliping a binder clip to the canopy when I fold it. I love this travel system. The service was great and very quick. I definitely recomend this to anyone looking for a compact stroller/travel system. I will be using this stroller for a long time to come."
1,A decieving title but good ethnographic content,"I was not impressed by this book, particularly by the title. Only a small portion is dedicated to explaining kuru and its causes/effects on the Fore. The rest of the book is an ethnographic description of the life of the Fore, their reaction to kuru, and the ultimate outcome. In short, kuru is a disease of the CNS caused by cannablism (similar to mad cow disease). The studies take place around the '70s, and by then cannablism was on the decline, and resultingly the disease also became rare. This dry read was hard to get through and quite disappointing because of the decieving title. I would not recommend it unless the reader is genuinely interested in learning more about the Fore of New Guinea. It's interesting for a medical anthropologist, but not a casual read."
3,"Seem solid, but might want to buy inserts","Just got my pair of size 9's UK (for size 10-10.5 wide US feet), and I'm pretty well satisfied with the size and width of these boots.My only complaint is that the boots have heel pads which are simply glued to the inside of the boot, and are not covered by any kind of insert or liner. The glue isn't particularly secure on one of them, and even the other which is more secure will eventually work loose, since there's nothing to stop friction from slowly prying it up (it's easy to catch up on the underside of the pads). I figure I'll buy a thin insert and reglue them when the time comes, but this aspect of their design is a little disappointing."
5,Great boots!,"I have my own pair of these in black and have worn Docs off and on for nearly 20 years. I won't lie, they can be killer to break in but then they are the most comfortable shoes/boots I know. This pair, however, was for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. I bought her a box of extra large bandages and told her to use them on the backs of her ankles under her socks the first several times she wore them. Luckily she did so she was able to break them in without much trouble.They look great with all kinds of outfits from casual to even formal and have proven to be very durable. It does take a bit of getting used to all the laces so if you want something you can slip on and off quickly, find something with a zipper."
2,Not like they used to be,"I was very disappointed when I received these boots. They are now made in china (not too surprising guess) and made out of the toughest piece of leather ive come across.They were rediculously stiff, even for a new boot (I have several other pairs of leather boots lace up and non and none of them were as bad as these when new)Overall I would not recommend these boots, you can order the english made ones else where Id try that or buy a different brand"
2,doesn't look brand new,Unfortunately I live in the Philippines and couldn't return the item. This straw bottle doesn't look brand new. The color of the flip cover is faded and doesn't match the shade with the rest of the body.The straw sticks out a little too much. I have to push it back to cover the top. The plastic hinge has signs of over bent? Turned white like any plastic that has been stretched beyond its limit.
3,Foogo straw,"I like everything about this product EXCEPT that the inside straw tends to become dislodged, and my 5-year-old cannot fix it by himself. Frustrating."
1,Straw broke,"We were extremley happy with this cup's look and non leakage but it was heavy for our one year old, I still loved it but after about a month the straw broke! It seems like a simple contraption but now when my son sucks nothing comes up. We can't figure out why and it has no hole, it has something to do with the non-leaking mechanism in the straw. Very sad it didn't work out."
3,Good but not great,"This sippy is good because it keeps the drink cold longer than other cups, but I don't understand how people say it doesn't leak. It does! Another mom said the same thing; IF you close it then it won't leak, AND it stays upright. However, if your toddler puts it down on its side, or tipped over with the top open it leaks ALOT and very fast! More than once my little guy has put his sippy down in this way and has gotten soaked in 2 seconds."
3,"Nice bottle, but had to wait 5 weeks for replacement straws.",My main complaint is the straw is vulnerable to breaking. I called customer service and was put on a five week waiting list. Now the new straw is starting to break. It's a nice bottle and hasn't leaked for us unless the cap isn't snapped shut. It's sort-of a hassle to wash all of the parts.
1,Circuit breaker finder,"Item received on time. I followed the instructions which were not clearly written and did not succeed in getting the product to function as it should have. As a test, I used an extension cord to see if the signal was strong enough to allow the receiver to pick it up...it did not. I could not even pick up the signal from an adjacent outlet which was on the same circuit. I tried different breakers and got the same result..nada."
3,Sunk by narrative,"A beautiful concept featuring interesting and well spoken origami artists - but as is common in many documentaries that rely more on subject than form, the film maker attempts to sculpt more of a progression than needs to be made. In other words, this short film is over packaged. If you can ignore our breathless narrator and focus on the artists/engineers themselves, you're sure to find some interesting insights into folding paper as a form of expression."
2,unhappy,"the t-shirt was for my son. It shrank when we first washed it. Plus it faded. Almost all of the color washed out. I don't feel like I bought a cheap t-shirt, but it washed like it was one."
1,Junk,"Bought this Arrow Model ET2025 to install Tyvec and install bat insulation. Placing the setting on the highest value, the 1/2 inch staple would not drive all the way in. When the stapler jam it was very difficult to remove the jam staples. This product is not recommended. Junk is the only rating, not even worth one star."
2,Unless you've served...Don't RATE!,"Gen Karpinski did what she had to do with what she had. She did take on responsibility within her scope but was also set up. I've been in for 23 years and this army IS changing. It's apalling how the senior leadership believe they are above the law yet try to inculcate the ARMY VALUES, what a crock! Gen Karpinski walks the walk and talks the talk. Great book to be read by women who are in the Army and for women considering to join the Army."
5,A compassionate tale about the '60s,"This book brought back the '60s, the newspaper industry as it once was, and the decency of people like Al Martinez who made working at a newspaper both exciting and rewarding.Although the craft is shaky in some areas, the story is strong, and the men and women depicted are people all of us who have worked in newspaper have known.Few survived those times, and this sensitive novels shows why. Treat yourself to a trip back to the less-complicated world of the '60s, in a time it was much easier to tell the good guys from the bad. You'll taste the whiskey, smell the cigarettes and experience a time that will never be again.Bonnie Hearn HillAuthor, Huelga House"
3,"Define ""Thin kerf"" please","This is a tough and sharp saw blade. However I bought it thinking it would be a good finishing blade when using my battery powered saw. It does, but the kerf is twice the width of my DeWalt and Diablo blades and consequently burns through batteries much too quickly. It's a very nice blade, but not that suitable for battery saws."
3,waylon is better then this video,all of waylon songs were rushed. The instrumental work was very good as far as it went.
3,Tie in stories,"This book is a tie in to the film Demond under glass.It's writen by different authors, each giving a unique take on the characters from the film.Given the intense relationship between the two male leads, it might not be to everyones taste."
3,A good movie to pass the time....,"Don't go into watching this movie with any expectations other than that of laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all. While it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's really only good for Saturday-at-home-with-a-snack type of viewing."
4,Legos and Bob the Builder - great fun!,"My 2-year-old really likes this toy. He got it for his birthday. He likes Scoop, Lofty, etc. the best. The other pieces though, he honestly just treats like Lego pieces - not necessarily trying to build anything specific to Bob-the-Builder. But, great themed toy and Legos are always awesome."
1,Not a fan of Cedric? Then don't read this!,"I think I was a little mislead by this book. At first, I thought it was going to contain funny material like George Carlin's Brain Droppings. But instead it was more about Cedric's life. And to be honest, I didn't find it all that funny. I stopped reading it after the first 20 pages. Hard core fans of Cedric will like this, but others might not. I thought Drew Carey's bio was much funnier."
5,Must Own,"Definitely worth owning if you have a PS3. There aren't many great games out there for the PS3, so it almost feels like this is a must own."
4,Amazing Game but Amazingly Short,"This is one of the best FPS I have ever played but I couldn't believe it when the credits started rolling after a couple of hours in a single player game.I know there is more to the game playing online but i just was left wanting more.Visually breathtaking, but short - 4 stars."
5,about the only good game out there,this game is awesome i couldnt tell you about the single player cuz i have never played it i only bot this game for the online and it was worth it one of the best online games i have ever played
3,BEST GAME EVER BUT WITH NO MULTIPLAYER STORYMODE,This is the best game i have ever played. But it has no coop. If you have a sibling and you hate giving turns to the fun mission dont buy this game. I would reccomend Army of Two if you have a sibling.
4,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,This game is awsome. It is way better than black ops!!! The graphics are great. There are some hacks but some of them are fun like zombieland. Expect to see some good players!!!
1,Watch out,"Just a heads up. This game is full of hackers. The company here doesn't seem to care about that at all. Several times it took them a long time to fix this and as of right now, 3/18/11, they've stopped trying all together. Play at your own peril"
3,Not for me,"Well this is my first time with the PS3, I have been playing FPS like Open Arena, Doom, Quake etc on the P.C.I did not like the controller, found game play difficult and I could not keep my head straight. (On my body to move.)Did not care for the sarcastic commanders and when the boat exploded on the first excursion my ""team"" left me and I could not figure out how to get out of the d#$# BOAT. What ever happened to no man left behind?In short making the transition is not worth the effort, this one is going on the shelf."
3,Manual missing,"I've returned this product. The product was missing manual. I did not notice it in the first place. When i submitted the product for TRADE IN @ Amazon, i was notified that the product was missing the manual.I simply did not have a choice but to return the product."
5,Best PS3 Game so far,"Being a PS3 enthusiast I was looking forward to getting this game since it was announced. Boy did it deliver! Graphics are by far the best of any FPS I have played on a console. Story is very engaging and fun to play, specially when you get to the Chernobyl sniper stage. You will not be disapointed. Multiplayer option is amazingly deep, making you always want to go for the next rank and new challenges. A must buy!!"
4,"Good graphics, good gamplay, good replay value, Overall GREAT GAME!","Call of Duty 4 has great graphics, not quite the full potential of the ps3 but certainly as good as what the 360 would have to offer. It has some of the coolest story line effects(NUKES) that I've ever seen in a fps. I haven't tried the online multiplayer yet but I would expect it's good too. The split-screen multiplayer is very fun, offering the ability to call in air strikes and attack helicopters. Overall this game ranks just as good as the other Infinity Ward made Call of Duties for the PC. 4 out of 5"
1,fragrance free no more,"i have used arm and hammer super scoop FRAGRANCE FREE clumping cat litter happily for several years. it is NO LONGER REALLY FRAGRANCE FREE, and emits some chemical fumes. they are so determined to mask cat elimination odors that they have sacrificed the unscented feature i needed.Arm & Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Litter, Unscented, 14-Pound"
3,Bought it on a whim,"I don't remember these series and for good reason. These shows were very short lived because they were ripping off other series in order to produce new toys. That being said, it's a great slice of nostalgia and it's so cheap, I'd say it's actually worth buying just to check out."
1,He was my old journalism teacher,"From what he read for us, it was strange and didn't make much sense. What did an ant named Pepe have to do with anything? Guess I had to be there...."
2,How about spell check?,"i was leery about buying this book from the seemingly negative user reviews it received, but i went ahead and did it anyway. i was surprised at the number of blatant spelling errors and the multitude of examples that did not work. i did get a lot of practice debugging actionscript, though. if you don't want to spend time fixing author errors and reading confusing, misspelled text, then don't bother buying this book."
2,Lots of errors but good learning tool,"I got this book to learn more about OOP style programming and for the most part that what it does. If you really want to have a good primer for actionscript oop programming this is the book. The down side to the book is all the errors and the section with the XML does not give all the code you need for the drop-down menus (unless you download the fla). If you are not great at debugging the author's code, be prepare to be frustrated and disappointed. I can't give this book a high rating because of all the errors but for reference alone and coverage on basic OOP structure I have to give it 5 stars. Anything after chapter 5 its slim picking for good and valuable code. Maybe Jeff Tapper should have waited to write the book after Collin Moock put out his so he can see how to write good code. With that aside the book is uh....ok."
3,A lot of info...too high a price,"Long wordy explainations, limited examples and just plain not enough useful information. After reading my copy of the Actionscript for Flash MX book by Kerman, I expected wonderful things of this book. Knowing that Actionscript was totally rewritten and was going to have a learning curve, I expected a book similar to Kerman's in the fashion of starting simple and working up to advanced. Instead, the book was littered with verbose explanations and poor examples. At just under 500 pages (the online page count is wrong), this book simply gives an overview of the language. It does do a decent job of focussing on Object Orientation and the techniques involved, but given the limited number of books available on the language of Actionscript 2.0, I just expected more.If you are new to Actionscript 2.0 and have a limited background with programming, this is not the book for you."
5,Well worth the wait,"I preordered the CD based on Eric's last CD. I have played it many times since receiving it. I think that my favorite song is ""Why not today"" but ""The Last Real Cowboy"" is a close second. This is music the entire family can enjoy.Nonie D"
3,foosball technigues a-z,"I owned this book, it was even autographed by ""Thor Donovan"" the doubles world champion at the time of publishing. Thor was also my doubles partner in local East-bay No. Cal. tournements in No. Cal. in the early '80s. I took foosball seriously, very seriously. This book (though dry) was and is the quintessential book on foosball technique, very clear, very precise. If you want to play foosball well get it."
1,never again,not true to size! these did not fit like plus size at all! very very very very very very small!!
1,Not worth your time.,This book was a real dissappointment. It really had no character development and the ending was predictable. I rate it with one star only because there is nothing lower available.
3,"Not his best, but worth the time","No, it's not Dress Gray, nor is it Full Dress Gray (which I'm reading, now), but it's a heckuva lot better than some of the Summer reading I've seen on the beach, the bus and the stairmaster. Though Truscott surpasses many men writing from a woman's point of view, he is more believable writing from a man's. Heart of War's protagonist lacks the depth of Slaight or Hand. As in Dress Gray and Full Dress Gray, Truscott does hit on familiar themes: women at West Point, military and academy tradition and gay characters. Fun to read."
3,OK,In this book the Yeerks invade the free HB colony. there is also the diary for one of Jake's ansestors who was a general in the Civil war. It's not too good :(
3,For Animorph Fans Only,"This book is worth a read to Animorph fans but, people just picking up the series might find it confusing. Unfortunatly, there are one too many plot lines in this book to make it one of the best. The two-stories-in-one-book idea made me feel that K.A.A. didn't want to spend the time to make a full-length, high quality, Animorph book so she threw in a second plot about the Civil War. To conclude, K.A.A, if you are reading this, please in the future stick to one story line."
3,The ONLY worthwhile account.,"Thus far, Mr. Hamilton's documentation of this series of UFO sightings is definitive.Why?Because he sticks with the facts, outlines them succinctly, provides a readable timeline and does not strayinto unnecessary speculation.This book offers a methodical and intriguing reconstructionof the bulk of sightings, based on interviews with many of the eyewitnesses.Fascinating details you will not find anywhere else, intelligently arrangedwithout any tedious intrusion of authorial ego or New Age-ish blatherings.So, until a completely updated, thoroughly scientificand exhaustively detailed documentation of theseongoing sightings is ever published, Mr. Hamilton's book will remain the single bestand ONLY investigation in book formthat deserves your time and money and attention."
2,Sony VGP-AMC1 Neoprene Carrying Case for VAIO S Series Notebooks,"This cover is too lightweight, as the thickness of the neoprene material used is too thin. It does increase the protection somewhat, however it would not, I feel, provide anything other light 'knock' cover. Secondly the case does not have any carry handles, which again adds to the risk factor. I would, if given a second chance spend a bit more to get a higher level of protection."
2,Does NOT fit the S Series notebook,"Once you get the package, if you read the cover it says it is not only for the S series but it also for another type of laptop. And the laptop case is meant for laptops that are up to 15 ins. I bought this thinking it would snug fit with my S Series notbook but it was WAY TOO BIG! I kept the package for the power cord case. Other than the power cord case fitting, the case for the laptop itself is CRAP!"
2,Not durable,"I got this for my Vaio VGN-SZ230P. After 9 months both zippers had derailed themselves at the sharp corner. One of the other corners has worn bare. The case is nice looking, though."
1,TV Dud House,"Possibly the biggest let down yet. Now I know why they kept the description so vague. The phrasing to watch out for here is ""best of"" and not complete. I expected less of a sampling compilation DVD and more complete installments of each grouping. I guess ""best of"" is opinionated terminology. Why even bother to rip off what few people may even be interested in this, did they think they where going to get enough customers for a box set? Don't waste your money on this limited poor showing, it will only leave you wanting the episodes you thought should be on the DVD. I wish they listed all the episodes on the description,even the packaging omits this. They should've called it a copulation DVD as I got screwed.Just watch them on YouTube like everyone else!"
5,Saturday TV Funhouse Rocks!,"I always ejoyed these clips on Saturday Night Live. There's more to Smigel than The Ambiguously Gay Duo, particularly the Ex-Presidents and those cartoon parodies that look so real, but have very adult themes.I bust a gut over Shazang's sadism.This DVD is loaded with extras, clips that didn't make it on to the 2 hour feature.It's great for home viewing, but make sure your guests don't require a lot of political correctness before showing it to them."
1,spoiler: this movie sucks,"this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. and dont say that just because im a kid i dont ""see the true value of the movie"". yes, it may be slightly moving because ""hes really pretty on the inside but his face (mask) is hiding that and only some people can see that"", but once you get over that this movie has absolutely no entertainment value.oh, and he dies at the end. no inspirational ending here.i hope his heads still growing too.dont watch this movie, not only does it have cher in it but it just sucks."
4,Good size and durability,This is a much better spatter cover then I had previously purchased from a local store. It is a nice quality and good size. It covers my largest dinner plate and is easy to wash. It isn't the top of the line spatter cover but it's better than others I've had in the past. It was a great purchase for the price!
5,Micro saver,"Love it, ove it, Love it. Sturdy, does what it says and it has steam vents which allows the food to heat more evenly all while keeping the micro clean"
2,not long,My son used this spatter cover and he said I hate this! It takes so much longer to cook things. If you have time to waste buy this!
2,Disappointed,"This splatter shield does what it is supposed to do, however, I have since learned that not only are some of the soft plastics harmful, but I have read and heard that the hard plastics emit harmful chemicals when they are heated.I replaced all the plastic containers in my kitchen with glass ones and reverted to the old standby splatter shield - Waxed Paper!It is too late to return this product and it is not worth paying the price to mail it back anyway."
3,Does not fit original Steinberger L2 basses,"Owners of original Steinberger L1-L2 basses should note that these instruments originally used Rotosound Superwound 606 strings and were a double-ball round wound single-wire-core exposed at the bridge end of the string. The original Steinberger L2 bridge saddles (v1) were made for the single core (bare single wire core) type string. Rotosound RDB 66LD string sets will not fit on original Steinberger L1, L2 basses without modifying the original bridge saddles.Rotosound RDB66LD Swing Bass 66 strings are wound all the way to each ball-end and unfortunately the original v1 bridge saddle seat is too narrow to fit these strings without modifying (cutting wider and deeper grooves) in the bridge pieces.If you own an original Steinberger L1 or L2 bass please note that Rotosound RDB66LD Swing Bass 66 strings will not fit your bass."
4,Looks Great,"If you are like myself and love Godzilla and other TOHO monsters, then this is a must have for your collection. The only problem with this and why it didn't get five stars from me is because it doesn't stand up! It looks great, yes, but it keeps falling over since Rodan doesn't have a tail to balance him with. So, if you have something to prop him up against, then take him out of the box and enjoy him, but keep him in the box and look at him if you enjoy having it to look at. Because he does fall over every now and then"
1,Terrible penetration after they changed the tips,I had some of the old style Arrow T50 Staples (same model number) which have diagonal cut points on the tips. Those work great for numerous applications. I had to get some more and guess what they changed the style of penetration tips to something that does NOT work. These will not go through heavy cloth or mesh. Avoid!Arrow should have had the decency to change the model numbers on their T50 lines to indicate that they were gimping them down to be less effective (and force one to use more staples?).
5,Usable Information,I found this book to be a great collection of usable practices to overcome difficulties. Art didn't whine or complain about his own situation. I think this book is one that can be used as reference-type of book where you will use it again and again to re-build your confidence and faith.
5,ROFLCOPTER!,"I went to google.com and searched my name...Jarred Stephen Olson. Then I clicked the ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" button and it came to this book. The funny thing is, my dads name is Steve Olson, and look who the author is :p"
4,Good Read,"Informative, well researched, well written, and enjoyable.The book covers every continent and how the human genes spread though that land. Included are interesting anecdotes."
4,a good read,"This book by Steve Olson is about DNA and where we human beings came from. For instance he says that all of the 6 billion people alive today have descended from a small group of anatomically modern humans who once lived in eastern Africa.Historically wherever modern humans met and perhaps mixed with the earlier human beings the older human beings eventually disappeared.Fascinating reading.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Slow But has very good content.,"No Start - 1 (Automotive Sensor Testing & Oscilloscope Waveform Analysis) I am taking back the negative review I wrote about four months ago.Somehow the video I purchased and watched did not match at the time.4 or 5 months later I can't find it in my video library.When I get this solved, I watch the video and it is totally different from what I saw the first time. It has some excellent instructional information for all starting computer control techs and osilloscope users. Experienced techs may learn something new or something they forgot. There is just one con. The video is over 2hrs long. It could have been an hour shorter. It moves Slow Slow Slow. After a procedure is demonstrated two or three times you then get to stare at the part and listen to the most awful ""music"" for 30-40 seconds, and there are about 45 min. worth these pauses included. I would still recommend it for it's content."
4,Great Book...,"...or so I thought then. I remember reading this in 6th grade back in 1980. At age 11 this was my first ""Adult"" book. My brother had checked the book out of the Junior High library, and over the next three years I read it over again at least a half dozen times, but once I got to High School I no longer had the opportunity to read it. Certain scenes from the book stick with me to this day. The light as a feather, stiff as a board scene, and the hijinx at the graveyard are some of my best literary memories. I've been looking for this book for quite some time, to reread it, but am afraid that it will compare to the great memories I have for it. This book started and fed my enjoyment of the Horror/Thriller genres, that I still enjoy to this day."
1,"Too small, and poorly designed","Ok, I actually bought this for the S5 IS (maybe it's a little bigger than the S1 and S2? Dunno, but owners of those two complained also)Anyway, it barely closed, and the zippers don't stay up very well. There isn't really space for any thing extra either.I bought a replacement at K-Mart by Case Logic. Bigger, extra room for memory cards and a couple cords; more padding; half the price. Plus it came with a nice strap."
3,Excelent Case for a Camera (other than S5),"This is an excellent case for a camera, very well constructed, high quality materials.however, it is advertised for the S5, and it fits, VERY TIGHT. you will not have space for anything else than the camera, and it takes time to put the camera in to the case. other than that, maybe for the old S series, it is excelent."
3,Protects the camera.,"This case can stay with your camera all the time (it hangs on the camera's own strap), and protect it from bumps and bonks, but that's about it. It doesn't hold *any* extra gear larger than an SD card. No batteries, for example. And it won't keep out more than a few drops of rain, since it doesn't close on the sides all the way. With an S3, the fit is a little tight, although still usable, and the case tends to pull the lens cap off when you remove the camera from it. Also, the snap holding the case to the camera strap tends to come undone easily, making the case easy to lose.If you want a weather-proof and holds-extra-stuff case, you will need to get something larger. This case may still be helpful, however, as it is only slightly bigger than the camera itself, and will probably fit inside a larger bag and protect the camera when it is hanging from your neck."
1,Camera bag,"The picture makes this look the same size as the canon 2400 gadget bag. I got one of each. This bag is so tiny you can barely fit the camera in and get it zipped. When I include the 4-AA batteries, the zipper doesn't even close."
3,Too small,"Very good quality, but need to be a little bit bigger to be perfect.I do not have room for keeping a lens cleaner kit which is essential for this camera or even spare batteries.Good product to protect the camera, but you will need another bag for long trips."
2,Not for me,"I bought this to go with the new Canon camera I purchased but it's not user friendly, at least not for me. It has no shoulder strap and only fits on a belt. That might be fine for a male (although my husband didn't like it either) but it's very inconvenient for a female. I went out and bought another one and this one is being returned."
3,Its just a case,"Yes, it will just hold your camera but will not protect it to a great extent. It is so perfectly designed that they have not left any room for anything else. Also there is no proper cushion or anything inside which protects the camera."
2,Overpriced,"Quality is satisfactory, but it is too ""snug"" for an S3-1S making it a stretch to get the cover closed onto the velcro. The lack of an integral handle and/or strap is a negative. Considering the ready availability of cases with better fit and features than this for half the cost, this is grossly overpriced. Regrettably that seems to be the general rule for manufacturers brand name accessories."
2,Canon PSC-75 Camera Case,"The Canon PSC-75 camera case is quality constructed and well padded. Unfortunately, it is marginally too small for its intended use. The camera with its attached neck strap barely fit in the case. By adding a spare memory card in the inside back pouch, closing the case becomes a squeezing challenge. There is absolutely no room for a spare set of batteries. If the top velcro fastener is not fastened, the side zippers may creep open.The S5 IS camera that I previously reviewed is very good to excellent."
2,No case for this case,The case does not have any straps. One must rely on the camera straps to shoulder the case w/ camera. When the camera is in use one can't keep the case on one's shoulder. Where do you put it?
1,I hate this case!,"I didn't realized when I bought this camera case that it was so small. The camera (Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom) just fits in it, and only if you position the camera just right will the case close properly. And with Canon's persistent loose lens cap design, I can hardly put the camera in or take it out without knocking the lens cap off.There's no room to stash extra batteries or memory cards. And because it has no strap of its own, when I take the camera out of it, it is loose and I have to hang on to it. It would only be useful to me if I put it on a belt, which I don't wear anyway."
2,Not a great design,"The case is made of nice leather and fits the camera. It is cumbersome to use, the zippers on the side do not lock, and can un-zip on their own. The velcro closure at the top provides some security if the camera is put in the case just right, with the strap folded neatly and put to the side of the lens. Otherwise everything bulges too much and it's difficult to secure the velcro. The case has to come off to use the camera, so it functions best when the case is on your belt.Basically, this case is adequate, but no more."
3,Camera case,"Quality is good. Too small for the Canon camera (S3 IS) I have. Fits, but is a really tight squeeze."
5,Great bag and very handy,This is a very good bag and has just the right amount of space and padding.
3,Dust guard camera bag,This camera case is a bit too small. By the time you add a few batteries and an extra chip it is over stuffed. If you leave out the extras it makes a good dust cover.
4,Canon S5 Camera case,"We bought this case for Canon S5 camera, it is very compact and the camera fits in very very tightly. I would buy some other larger bag if you need to use it to carry batteries and any other accessories. It is mainly a camera carrying case only.Other than that, the bag is perfect fit for the camera."
2,Too Small,"Please don't throw away your money. Camara fits, but you will soon be replacing this with a larger case."
5,Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case is dead on,"I had looked at many camera case options for weeks before purchasing this one, and was amused reading the reviews. Some people thought it was to be a gadget bag for multiple items. This is a camera case DESIGNED TO ONLY COVER THE CAMERA. It is well made, and does exactly what it is intened to do. The belt loop makes it a very handy side-arm style tote which frees up one's hands for fighting off muggers and Canon thieves. I am very pleased with this product. It will only hold the camera and maybe an additional SD card. All the other stuff I need I put in my Canon 200eg Backpack(also 5 stars). My hands remain free for the aforementioned altercations and/or other dexterous endeavors that may arise."
1,Doesn't Fit Powershot S2 IS,"I bought this case because Canon recommends it for the S2 IS.It's too small for the camera. With the strap attached, you have to force the camera in and pull hard on the zipper to get it closed.The case is shaped like a purse that doesn't completely cover the camera near the top, so I don't how suitable it'd be for outdoor use.Overall, this is not well designed and a poor fit. I'm sending it back."
3,Small for the S3 Size,"We tried to get the best case for our recently bought Powershot S3 and we purchased this Soft Case. On the positive side it is soft, and its size is small enough to fit inside some purses. In addition, it seems to do a good job on the protection of the camera. However, the camera fits quite tight inside of this case, and it barely has room for a spare set of anything. We could just place an additional memory card, but if you want to fit batteries or anything else, you better purchase a bigger case.It's not that I am dissapointed at this one, but I really think this should have been better."
2,Canon Camera Case,Returned product as it did not have a strap and was to small to hold any accessories ie batteries etc
3,Don't BE FOOLED!,"FYI - this item was 'beneath' the S5 camera listing and (foolishly) I thought it would house that Canon camera! NOT! Does not fit the S5 and don't think it does! Probably not a good place to list this item, beneath a camera that won't fit into it. FYI..."
3,A Bit Too Small!,"Doesn't allow camera carrying strap to fit into the case, and makes it awkward to insert the camera without knocking the flimsy lens protector off. (How could they make such good cameras and crummy lens caps?) On the plus side, it does work and protects the S5 IS reasonably well - once you get it inside."
2,it's not that useful,"this case is too small for S3 IS camera, and I did not find it convinient either."
1,Terribly disappointing,I purposely read all of the reviews on this camera case and precisely matched it up to my husband's camera. What a disappointment on Christmas day when it was inches short of closing.
2,Nice Case But a Poor Fit,"This case may be appropriate for many of the Canon cameras, but for the IS, it is too small, probably because of the longer lens. Trying to get the camera in it is a chore and then it will not close up properly."
5,Soft case does the job,This soft case fits the camera well and does the job of protecting it. It is a good accessory to have.
3,Ordinary staples- a little over priced,"You can buy these same staples a lot cheaper at Home Depo. Good product, not a real value when bought here."
5,Quality wide angle adapter,"I bought a less expensive adapter a while back and found it to by unsatisfactory. The Canon one fits perfectly, has no apparent vignetting and works seamlessly with an S3-IS. Do not waste money trying to find something cheaper."
3,Poor recording quality,"These are popular arrangements of Gershwin's music, more jazz-club style than broadway. They are original recordings sung by the stars of the era. While there is some remastering, there remains noticeable extra sounds, so be forewarned that these are not 'pristine' CD-quality recordings, understandably."
4,Marcb from Orange County,"Al Green and producer Willie Mitchell's hooking up after all these years is one of the great miracles the millenium. Together, the pair produced some of soul's most signature albums, including ""Call Me"" and ""I'm Still in Love With You."" However, Green turned to God in the late 1970s and stayed away from the profane world of pop. Until now.Recorded in the same studio where they cut their early 70s masterpieces, Green and Mitchell have come up with an essential work graced with strong production and Green's velvety-smooth voice. I can't stop listening to the album, which sounds like it was cut in 1974, strings, soul and all. Al pleads, whispers, yells, shouts and croons. Mosly, he loves. His long-time fans will too after they hear this return to form from an icon who went away for far too long."
3,I NEED...!,"Asao, a middle aged man, wants to have sex and comes to the conclusion that he needs a car in order to get laid. He buys a car but his plan is futile, which causes him to think that he needs a cabriolet in order to achieve his goal. This plan fails, which moves him to think that people who flie first class get to have what he so badly wants. However, he has run out of money and is in debt. This leads him to conspire to rob a bank and from this point on his troubles increase and it seems like he has lost focus on his goal. Getting Any? is an comical film that provides numerous laughs through a large number of short scenes put together into a longer film, but it becomes tedious as the film goes on."
3,Wait a minute... ...BOX SET?,"For quite a while, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this monumental recording. The copy I had, though was on audio tape, which after being played thousands of times, became slightly worn out. I decided to pick up the CD, but in searching I found it had been recalled by the label to be replaced by the much more marketable box set. Disgusting! Sure, the ""previously unreleased"" tracks are great, but, they are not part of the original work, and if Mr. Davis had wanted those recordings to be released, I'm sure he would have seen to it himself. 3 stars, not because of any lacking in the music, but rather to account for the corporate necrophilia."
1,AWFUL! NO STARS!,"Bitches Brew signaled the turning point in jazz from popular entertainment to self-centered, unlistenable dross. Fans of Davis's earlier work will weep upon listening to this mess."
2,Guinevere,"The cut ""Guinevere"", disc 3 track 6, is coherent, well thought-out, lyrical and listenable.Also parts of ""Little Blue Frog""."
2,19 pieces! Never opened the box,"I just want to point out that this is only a 19 piece set. I should not have assumed that it was a bigger set, but I did because of the cost. It looks cute, but not sure if it is worth the money."
4,Verdades y Mentiras de la Revolucion,"Ademas de un poco de Historia de la Revolucion Sandinista encontramos al estilo unico de Sergio Ramirez una gran Novela, Daniel Ortega(Lider Sandinista y ex-presidente de NIC) lo califico en signo de burla como un gran ""Cuentista"" y no lo podemos negar este Señor es un gran Narrador sus novelas han triunfado a nivel internacional y a ayudado a muchos otros escritores Nicaraguenses a salir adelante. Adios Muchachos esta lleno de sinceridad me agrado mucho ver que se aceptan que hubo muchos errores en la decada de los 80 cuando el regimen sandinista estaba a cargo,lo recomiendo tanto para todos aquellos que se enamoraron y apoyaron la revolucion en sus inicios como para todos aquellos que salieron de Nicaragua por motivos politicos, ""un libro escrito con valor"""
5,The Great American Novel,"This is it. I cried when it was over. I walked in a daze. This is, by far, the most satisfying novel I have read perhaps ever. As with ""The God of Small Things""(Arundhati Roy), it is simply perfect; beyond reproach.Read it."
3,Fantastic Start...But Way Too Many Words and Too Lengthy,"The first few hundred pages of Chabon's THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER & CLAY are fantastic. I live in New York City and work with a lot of Jews, so the historical premise of the book is profound to me. Chabon's characters are very real and interesting to boot. Unfortunately, around page 350-375, the book begins to lag. I mean REALLY lag. I was in love with this book, but I eventually gave it up altogether! Mind you, the book is very, VERY long and Chabon is far too wordy. There were about four words every page that I didn't know the definition of. It's good to expand the reader's vocabulary, but not to this excess. If I had looked up the definition of every word I didn't know, it would have taken me a year to read.This novel is simply too epic for its own good...and I'm still not fond of comic books...and I still can't understand why Joe finds Rosa attractive."
2,This is Grady Tripp's Runaway Novel,"Chabon's ""Wonder Boys"" was a fantastic novel. Read it. (The movie adaptation was also excellent.) In it, professor and author Grady Tripp is writing a novel that runs to several thousand pages with no sign of ending. He cannot control what does and does not go in or focus on a through-line.Although only 656 pages, ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"" is Chabon's runaway novel. If you are very interested in comic books, there is a good 200 page novel in there somewhere. If you are very interested in World War II era Eastern European refugess and their lives in the United States, there is a good 200 pages of that in there somewhere. But as it stands, they are not worth digging out of ""Kavalier & Clay"".Chabon has done some excellent work and has been very successful. And most authors have a great investment in their work. But Chabon's editor needs to stand up more firmly. In the meantime, read (or re-read) ""Wonder Boys""."
2,Sinks to the level of its subject matter,"If you like your Pulitzer-winners average then this is the book for you. ""The Amazing Adventures"" probably really deserves a three, but it loses one star for the damage it does to the reputation of a venerated award. It's a novel about comic books that has the plot pacing and dialogue of its subject matter but provides no saran-wrapped women to gawk at. Furthermore, the prose is overly romantic and the romances are overly prosaic. (Ha! Give ME a Pulitzer for THAT!) Buy the book if you want but keep your expectations low."
5,Worthy of Ten Pulitzer Prizes.,"It's too bad you can't nomiate the same book year after year for the Pulitzer, because ""Kavalier and Clay"" would win every year!This is hands down one of the best books I have ever read. Chabon's New York of the 1940s, the Clay and Kavalier families, and the creation of ""The Escapist"" and the pulp comic book industry was pure genius.I have read some of the ""Escapist"" graphic novels, they are worthy additions to the K&C; universe."
3,Interesting though not superb.,"The book contained several memorable scenes including the description of the search for the Golem of Prague and Joe's escape from Prague inside its coffin; the boys' work on putting together their first comic books; and Joe's antarctic military service. In addition, the story does a good job at portraying how difficult it was to be gay in the 1940s and 1950s. I cannot give the book four or five stars (...)"
2,Over-rated,"How this book won a Pulitzer I'll never know. There may be material here for a couple of good short stories, but a 700 page book?!I kept on anticipating some fabulous, comic book sized event to take place, but the book never got ""lift off"".Several friends told me it was a good piece of historical writing, that war-time New York and the golden age of comics were beautifully captured. I have a love of old comic books and the people who created them, but it fails to capture that magic."
2,This was a Pulitzer?,"I was extremely disappointed with this novel. In a nutshell, Chabon took the movie Chasing Amy, stripped away the sharp dialogue and provocative examination of courtship and sexual politics and managed to walk away with a Pulitzer. Intriguing themes such as Holocaust survivor's guilt and homosexuality / family values in the 40's and 50's ran throughout the novel. Chabon, however, failed to explore these themes with the thought and insight worthy of a Pulitzer. Time and time again, pivotal life-altering decisions made by the characters were summarized in a few pages, or glossed over entirely leaving the reader with 500+ pages of filler material. The result is a book with a hollow plot and lackluster character development that was difficult to finish."
1,Writer Gone Pulitzer Prize Winner,"Chabon lost his touch. After winning the Pulitzer for Wonder Boys, he has begun to take himself to seriously. Glances at the dust covers of the two books tell the story (in less than Kavalier&#65533;s droll 600+ pages). Chabon&#65533;s portrait goes from light and genuine, to over-polished and dreary. His bio shifts from lucky kid from Pittsburgh, to &#65533;living in Berkeley, with his wife, also a novelist&#65533;&#65533; Kavalier and Clay is a slow and trite attempt to a period piece that is like watching a Charlie Chaplin movie with your eyes closed. Instead of reading this book, read Wonder one more time. If you liked Wonder, try Lit Life by Kurt Wenzel."
2,The Book Read Rags Summary read easier than the book.,One would think the author used the Scrabble Dictionary to help write this book. Extremely difficult to unravel the maze to get back to the storyline. When I read the concept I was looking forward to the read. I would not recommend this book.
5,"Captivating, imaginative and totally human","I was surprised that I actually felt regretful, even sad, when I finished the book. Definitely my favourite to date! The tale, one of epic proportion, revolves around the lives of 3 characters - Josef, Sammy and Rosa - all of whom were totally real and believeable. And the care at which Chabon develops his characters is simply mind-blowing. The entire tale wasn't rushed in any way (600+ pages) and yet it absorbed me right from the very first page. Chabon writes with amazing prose and captures the imagination of his readers with his introspective, and descriptive writing while maintaining the pace of the story throughout. Highly recommended."
4,"Big, quirky story to get Lost in","I would reccomend this story to anyone, even if it wasn't as well written as it is, simply to be exposed to its odd choice of venue. On your way through this story, you'll encounter magic and escapsitry, Jewish mysticism, the Golden Age of comic books, the Holocaust in Prague, surrealism, WWII in antarctica, and it goes on. Such a story with such far flung interests runs the risk of losing the reader in its sheer bizarre-ness. Chabon's great achievement here is that it all makes perfect sense at the end. On the way, you get sentences to luxuriate in, and drama that is intense, but never overbearing. It's a long one (636 pages), but if you are ready to be swept away to some truly unique locations, and hear a genuinely different story, read this book. It's the sort of book you can luxuriate in."
1,Colossal Bore,"To be honest I couldn't even finish this book.I'm a comic book collector. My brother is a comic book writer. I know comic books. I know the history of comic books.I also know this book is boring and is uninteresting after the boys get their comic book career off the ground.Also, call me ""homophobic"", but does the author have to put a homosexual writer in every book? (Wonder Boys had one as well) This just didn't ring true - it had the feeling of ""I need a homosexual writer"" rather than Sammy NEEDING to be a homosexual writer.After it got boring, it got stupid - the entire World War 2 segment in particular. We went from quasi-realistic to soap opera mush in the span of about 10 pages.Please skip telling me that it ""ended great"" - because I don't care. I'm off reading GOOD books now."
3,Amazing mediocrity,Sure a lot happens. But it is almost all without tension. We jump from situation to situation where the characters actions are clear. We get no sense of struggle though we are told about it. How did Sammy and Rosa really feel about each other? The characters except for Joe are not fully fleshed out.
2,What was this???,This book was recommended to me by a friend who stated it was one of the finest books she ever read. Perhaps I did not understand the story. I missed the point of the story. I could not relate to the characters. I did not find ir humorous. But did struggle to read it to the end.
3,Pulitzer Prize?,"Just finished the book. Well written, charming characters, but I kept waiting for the punch line that made it a Pulitzer Prize winner. Near as I can tell, there isn't one. No doubt I've missed some important point inside the novel, but ""Kavalier"" reads like any other Horatio Alger, boy-meets-girl story. A fun read, but not much more."
5,Wonderful in Retrospect,"I read this book back in December 2000. On the one hand, it was very interesting, however on the other, I had a difficult time getting in to it. Now, months later, the book has stayed with me, in a very charming and endearing way. I highly recommend it."
3,not great,I found myself skipping a lot of this verbose book. Would have liked it better if it had it been edited.
2,Not great,"I started to read this novel with a bit of excitement as it came to me highly recommended. The prose is so ponderous to get through, that by the time I've reached the end of one of his run-on sentences, I have to reread the beginning to know what it was about. (Like that one!) I'm afraid that my $12.99 Kindle purchase price went down the drain."
1,Beware of low cost options,"Lamp arrive in good condition an it was operational. However, a blue haze exists in the lower right hand corner of the screen. While it is viewable it did not fix the ""change lamp"" warning either. My low cost decision did not fix my my problem. I will consider a different supplier the next time."
3,charger,"It is ok , but eats batteries horrifically takes 8 batteries to completely charge your phone i would not completely recommend it but if you have the batteries it will get you out of a tight !!!"
5,The greatest movie ever,This is a great story with loads of great skiing scenes in it. I just want to watch it over and over
4,Better than I expected it to be,"OK, I admit I rented it to see only Paul Gross from ""Due South"" but I was pleasantly surprised. Peter Burg (Berg?) from ""Chicago Hope"" plays 2nd fiddle and does it well. They work well together in this ""buddy"" film, despite some holes in the plot. I'm not a skier so found the length of some of the ""extreme skiing"" sequences tedious. But the scenery is gorgeously filmed. Overall, it has more actual plot than most Sat/Sun afternoon films on the tube."
1,it sucks dont any one buy from these people,"I think you totally suck for canceling my order with no explanation, and still taking the money out of my account which I have proof from my bankyou suck!"
5,Great eco-friendly solution to household plant pests!,"I bought these traps to help eliminate a fungus gnat invasion on my houseplants. I brought home a plant from a friend's house that apparently had adult gnats and eggs, and before I knew it, they were everywhere and in most of my plants. I set up three of these around my home and it has been about a month now. The traps have greatly alleviated my pest problem and along with the other measures I am taking to remove the gnats, I expect them to be completely gone soon enough. I am very happy with this product!"
4,You're Not Gonna Figure It Out!,"This is one unique tale! Adults are brutally killing all the children. However, some kids escape, find each other and form a survival group. Together, they'll fight the adults and try to figure out what's happening.Readers won't figure out the cause of the adult population's loss of sanity. It's not what you might expect. You'll get a surprise ending that hasn't been done before, to my knowledge.Will the kids survive? Will the adults return to normal? How widespread is the problem? Why isn't there one pregnant female adult in the entire story (I'm curious if she'd rip out her stomach to destroy the fetus)? Well, you'll just have to read BLOOD CRAZY to find out."
3,Unexpected Surprise,"Well, I must say that the book WAS something. I mean, first of all I'm one for knowing where I am when I read a book. It wasn't until I saw how some of the words were spelled and the constant use of ""mum"" and he made no usage of ""fahrenheit"" that I realized that it took place in the UK. There were quite a few intense moments, but, as one reader put it, it did kinda drag on and on. Nick was a prolific character, and I'm glad he was able to last throught the whole ordeal,and remained true to Sarah, ... I felt something should have been done about the bully."
5,Amidst the blood it has deep revelatory philiosophy,"Great book. Page turner. Finished it quickly. Good role model example for kids. It has a morale to the story. Also it's deep in meaning. In the book it tackles the 'Time Immemorial' question of God, does it exist? It tries to answer that somewhat during the book. I hope one day this becomes a movie. It certainly has big potential to be a Hollywood blockbuster that will knock the no good Harry Potter/LOTR of its undeserved throne. Beware and embrace it's psychological/unconcious solutionary overtones. Long live doomsday horror science fiction genres!"
3,"Clark, Blood Crazy","Blood Crazy by Simon Clark is a simple novel that has a simple description. It isabout all of the adults in the world suddenly going mad and killing their children,or anyone who is younger than 19. This book came before Cell by Stephen King, butthere are some similarities here, such as the ""Creosotes"" (what the kids call theinsane parents) flocking like birds and the children's atempts to masacre large numbersof them. It was a fun book to read but it was very childish. I don't think it wasmeant for children though because of its harsh language and descriptions of sex,but I'm not sure. Also, if you are a fan of Michael Crichton (or any author who atleast atempts to give a plausable explanation for the events in their book) you won'tlike this novel. It's a quick and bloody book and it is very interesting, but justchildish and a weak effort in my opinion. Still, this is my first Clark novel andI enjoyed it enough to read more of his work."
5,RUN for your life KID !!!!!!,"What a GREAT book!!! Totally kept me ingrossed the whole time. One morning kids or young adults wakeup to find anybody over the age of nineteen wants to KILL anybody under about nineteen. So parents are out killing there kids. Well the kids that get away band together to try to survive, with the adults hot on there trail trying to kill them. There is alot of twist and turns in the book and you never know whats going to happen next. A VERY enjoyable read."
5,ABAP Objects An Introduction to Programming SAP Applications,"Easy to follow, SAP software included!Lots of fun! Great book for beginning ABAP programmers or SAP users."
5,Brilliant,"By far the best ABAP book available. It covers the essentials of good coding using the object-oriented paradigm. If you want to be coding at a high level fast, read - no study - this book."
5,An excellent guide.,"For those who beggin programming with ABAP within a OO perspective, I think is the perfect guide. Of course itsn't a reference book but it's a excellent point of start ABAP having in mind an OO point of view."
1,Disappointed,"One of the highlights of the 80s is the 80's sound which is romantic, humble and upbeat. And Giorgio Moroder signifies 80s and had helped craft a very satisfying music in the original versions. Why does the remix try to erase that I don't understand. What should of happen is that they include both the original 80s versions and the new remixes.The new mixes may please others but to myself I prefer the original versions or if they tried to mix with the original sounds."
3,Pretty Good!,"Hello!I am a big fan of scarface,so I bought the soundtrack.It wasnt as good as I thought it would be. Most of the songs on there have that '80s cocaine feel (Rush,Rush to the Yeyo!). I enjoyed tonys theme and elviras theme the best though. What happened to the cochabamba theme when Tony went to Bolivia? that was a really nice song but for some reason it was not included on this cd.Any way, if you enjoy scarface, get this cd! If you like scarface but do not like 80's music(like me!)then getting this cd might be a bad idea.-steve"
4,No more frizz ...,"I really like this hair dryer. I have curly hair which tends to be dry normally and with the old hair dryers my hair would end up frizzed at the ends. This hair dryer does a quick, non scorching dry and leaves my hair looking soft. Not sure if it's my imagination but I do not seem to be loosing as much hair as I did when I used my old dryer. My sister purchased this hair dryer first and I got to use it at her house and I was happy with the results."
2,Warning - wiring problems,"As stated in some of the other reviews. I too had a HUGE problem with this hair dryer. Although it worked well before it shorted out. My dryer also had sparks flying and a shortage in the wiring at the connection where the dryer meets the cord. It over heated, melted and sparks were coming out of it. Luckily my children were not using this when it happened. Please do not buy!!"
2,Be careful!!!,"I had been using this hairdryer daily for about a year or so... until today. As I was holding it above my head, drying my hair, I heard a pop. A few sparks flew out the end and into my hair and the whole thing shut off. As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires. A tad bit dangerous if you asked me! Granted, I used this dryer on the highest heat setting everyday for a year, so I got a lot of use out of it, but every other hairdryer I've had in the past simply blows cold air when it stops working properly--this one could've caused me bodily harm. I think I may look into buying a different brand this time around."
1,Stay away from the dryer... stay away...,"I loved it at first... I thought it was GOOD that it got so hot that my hair held its shape better. Gradually I started noticing more and more breakage from the heat damage. OK, don't use it on the highest setting, lesson learned. After about a month of not quite daily use, the thing started shooting out SPARKS. I'm not about to aim something that does that at my head. So... it never died, but it did become possessed, so some element of the afterlife is definitely evident. This thing is a hair-singeing, spark-shooting weapon, folks. If you buy it, use it for something other than what it was designed for or you'll be bald and blind!!!"
3,It's ok,"I read these reviews and thought I had found a miracle product. I have medium-thick hair, but it is long, and there is a lot of it. My hair is usually somewhat frizzy after blow-drying. I have used the Ion Stylist for over a week now, and have not noticed a difference in drying time. I have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying, but I think that is due to the cool function on the dryer (better than most - cool air is expended almost immediately), rather than the ion feature. The real test, however, will be this summer in the NYC (subways!) humidity."
1,good while it lasted,Mine stopped working in less than 3 months. As I was drying my hair it all of the sudden stopped. Nothing I could do would make it turn back on. It wasn't that expensive but I do expect it to last longer than 3 months.
1,where there is smoke there FIRE!,"I just bought this and opened it up. I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair.I used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different - I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking. It may have spit out sparks as I felt something hit my head. I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire.It is brand new and it won't work.Everytime I turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes.I have a wonderful Revlon hair dryer that works great, so I thought it would be good. The one I have isn't ionic and wanted to try it, guess I'll go back to the old one.Don't buy it."
1,AMAZON!!!! WAKE UP!,"Why is it that Amazon continues to sell this obviously dangerous product when clearly 1/3 of all reviews relate to the electrical hazard? I wrote a similar review years ago addressing the popping and sparking problem, the frayed hot cord at the point the cord attaches to the handle, and other issues I was having with this. People are talking about fire and burned hair, for God's sake, and Amazon doesn't think they have a responsibility to retract this item from their inventory! Liability, Amazon????"
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I have curly, medium-length hair.I bought this dryer in the begining of the year thinking it would produce less frizz. After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair. My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable. Since the dryer was the only thing I changed in my hair-care regiment, I figured that was the answer. When I couldn't stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer. Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn't as dry and frizzy. I hate this dryer because of all the damage it did to my hair. And, although I did not experience the sparks, it short-circuit on me on a weekly basis.I don't recommend this product to anyone, especially for people with curly, think hair."
3,Ions? What ions?,"I bought this dryer hoping for a miracle. I have frizzy, half-curly ultra-thick hair, and I had really hoped that this dryer was going to make a difference.An hour after drying my hair with it, my hair was back to its frizzy self, and I really didn't notice a quicker drying time. The ions that are supposed to make my hair shiny and dry quicker were pretty unapparent.The dryer is a bit quieter than your average one, but I actually feel that my ... conair, although louder, is a bit stronger in force than this dryer.All in all, I'd say skip the ion fad and go for your typical dryer. You're paying ... more for a gimmick."
2,nothing special,"I got this blow dryer hoping that my frizzy hair would dry faster and get less frizzy...it took much longer to blow-dry my hair and the ionic thing does nothing for it. Overall, it's not that great."
3,Two years and blew up in my face,"This hair dryer gets HOT. I love the controls - separate for temp and power. I love the removable filter. I've had it for about 2 years and used it on the hottest setting daily. I haven't had any more hair breakage than the next person, several stylists have complemented me over the years on the health of my hair. HOWEVER, like these other ladies, my hair dryer just blew up in my face as I was using it. Sparks flew out where the cord meets the handle, & it's dead. Every hair dryer I've ever had dies like this eventually - looking for one as good as this that won't blow up or catch fire though."
3,For teenagers and up!,"When I say for teenagers and up I mean it. This book has sex and other thing that are unappropriate younger readers. It was unfortunate that I had to experience this since I am only twelve. So I recomend that this book be for teenagers only.As for the story here it goes: A 17 year old teenager name Marcus has been feeling strange since his 17th birthday six months ago. Since then he has been able to move boulders and burst trees with his mind. Then the night before he leaves to go to the a new town, where his mother has taken a job at an university, he plans to tell his girlfriend, Jules, that he has these powers, but other things seem to take their interests, this is the part that they do it. While they are doing it something strange happen she disappears into light. The rest of the story tells of how the he has a heritage that makes him the king of the the celtic magicians. In the end there is a strange twist ending the story very short.Mars"
3,Too narrow for most modern skis,"Because this rack is so narrow most modern skis don't fit well. Of the 8 pairs of skis we have only one fits easily into the rack. Fat skis are too wide and thick skis are to thick. The clearance is about and 1 1/4 wide, depth is about 110mm. If your skis match this profile then these should work well. BTW- very easy to mount and sturdy."
3,Reasonably good – for the price.,"There is not enough space for three modern, wide skis with binding. Also, I was not feeling comfortable letting all the weight of my skis to hang just on the ski tips, so I have installed the rack the way that the skis are standing on the floor and the rack is only holding them apart in the vertical position."
5,Cross Country Skis,"This is great, but unlike the photos I did not hang the skis by the tips. Cross country skis are bowed and when hung by the tips they don't hang straight up and down. Holding the skis tightly together and placing them in the hanger with the tips about one foot above the rack they fit snug without slipping down but not so tight that I am concerned about long term damage to the natural bow of the skies. If you do hang the skis by the tips then use a plastic ski clamp to keep the skis together at the bottom."
2,Doesn't fit the new wider skis,Product is wonderfully built...BUT will not handle the new wider skis. I would not recommend this unless you are purchasing for x-country skis.
3,Pretty Good,I am a geography and world history teacher and this book was suggested at a workshop I attended. I teach 9th & 10th grade. Some of my 9th grade students HATED coloring and some of them thought it was great. I might suggest using this as an alternate assignment for visual learners or anyone with dyslexia who has a hard time creating maps.
5,replacement tip,Got 2 tips for the center punch.cheaper than buying whole tool.have not tried it yet.don't know the strength of the tips. The original one lasted 30 years.
4,Must be viewed in context,"It would be a disservice to base your opinion on the single, one-star review. This video can be immensely helpful, especially when used in conjunction with one of Stew Smith's books. I was working through ""The Complete Guide to Navy SEAL Fitness"", but had trouble figuring out the swim stroke. For that alone, the video would have been worth buying. After watching, I realized that there were other exercises I thought I was doing correctly, but should be changed here and there."
5,better than London Calling,"Many have complained that Sandinista is a sprawling mess, but that is altogether untrue. There is, in fact, very little on this album that I would want removed. The sheer length of the lp may contribute to it's neglect, though. It's not for short attention spans; it's an album to lose yourself in."
3,the clash's white album,"I agree with other reviewers, there are some definite misses on this album. Also, if you cant stand reggae or dub rhythms, Sandinista will not appeal to you. This album is not fast or agressive or as iconoclastic as other clash albums.Other than that this album lets us see a very different band than on London Calling or The Clash. The quartet dabbles in a variety of musical styles and carries recurring riffs and themes through a number of songs. As such like the white album this album has a raw, unpolished feel. It goes so many directions and at the same time the creative and intuitive ear for music the band has is apparent. Even some of the weaker tracks are not complimented by a lack of imagination or laziness."
3,"Three stars as 36 tracks, five stars as 10!","Put together a tape of the following songs from this album and you have something, dare I say it, subtler, more daring and better than London Calling: 1. The Magnificent Seven 2. Junco Partner 3. Somebody Got Murdered 4. Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice) 5. Up in Heaven (Not Only Here) 6. Corner Soul 7. Police on My Back 8. Washington Bullets 9. Charlie Don't Surf 10. The Street Parade"
1,This game is garbage.,"What a joke this game is. When I play it, my partner opens with 3 clubs and then the game is over my partner doesn't have any clubs at all. Also when I big 2 of whatever suit, my partner takes it to 4 in that suit and then only has 3 cards in that suit. BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
4,Affordable lock that works just fine.,"I use this to latch a bicycle carrier into the tow hitch, and it works fine for that. I didn't want to spend a lot on something that doesn't need high security, so the goal was just to have some deterrent to grab & run. This is a notch better than I needed.The 5/8"" pin fits well, and appears to be chrome plated or polished. Slides easily in, thanks to the tapered point.The lock can be slapped into place *without* the key, which is handy when your hands are full.The plastic fitted cap just slides over the key side of the lock. It's is a bit hokey, and easy to lose, but probably necessary to keep road grit and mud from getting into the lockworks.In short, check to ensure you have the ""large pin"" 5/8"" receiver hole, and you're probably good to go. For the 2"" square hitch, the pin is perhaps a bit longer than it needs to be. Doesn't hurt anything, but it slides a bit side to side.All in all, works as promised."
1,Unpleasant and unfunny,"As other reviewers have noted, this time around the film makers have made Bridget SO inept and inane that she's just not funny. The focus is on her incredibly bad mismatch with Mark Darcy and after the second or third break-up you wish they'd just end it and get it over with. We really needed much more of Hugh Grant's Daniel Cleaver for it seems he's the only one who really seems to like Bridget this time around. But when the film takes a preposterously unrealisticturn into a Thai prison it moves from unfunny to decidedly unpleasant."
4,Great movie to watch over and over again,"Other viewers may not agree but I am a huge Colin Firth fan. I have had a crush on him ever since spotting him as the charming Mark Darcey in BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice""."
1,It was an awful film,"Thought I would like it because I liked the first one so much, but it is terrible!!!! Not even my favorite actors could save it."
4,screw ball comedy,"This movie reminds me of the old Hepburn/Grant/Tracy comedies. Renee Z. is charming in the role even though the plot is ridiculous. Hugh Grant shows how taken for granted as an actor he is by stealing the show. He is perfect as the swarmy suitor who is only after a fling. Firth shows that his character has a big downside for Bridget, he is a snob and looks down on her even if he loves her. There should be more to the love conquers all though since it is clear that the couple has real issues. Even in a comedy they should attempt to work on that problem and not sweep it aside. The dialog and actors keep it moving though and it is a vacant, enjoyable flick."
1,Godawfully dull and boring,"I fell asleep about two-thirds into this sequel when there seemed to be nothing at all happening. Colin Firth is dull as dirt as the dashing boyfriend lawyer, while Renee Zellweger's main joke is her fattened up appearance. The problem is there is no chemistry at all between the two, so we don't believe for even a second that Mark Darcy ""loves"" her, as he professes. And ditto for Hugh Grant who does and says nothing amusing. I didn't laugh even slightly, not even once, during this way too long comedy. Time to put this yarn to bed for good..."
5,fun movie,"This movie is hilariously funny, actors carry it through to the end, location of filming adds the kick to keep it moving and funny and human."
3,"Funny, but frustrating","I found some of this movie hysterical, yet also very frustrating to watch someone constantly doing self-damaging things. The first movie seemed more innocent in the wackyness of Bridget. This one seemed to try too hard and simply lacked the charm and chemistry of the first. Can't compare to the book as I have not read this one."
5,classroom dicipline,"I recieved a great price on the book! Also, it shipped quickly and I recieved it quickly!"
4,Good Starting Place,"As the title implies, this is a good publication for the beginner. The most significant information needed to get started right away is presented in clear, non-jargon language."
1,never buy this tool.,I had a very bad experiance with trying to return this item back and getting my money from these people. I suggest to stop your order cause this tool did not work at all. I will never purchase anything from this company. 6 months before the money was going to be returned to me. a lot a run arounds and e-mails back and forth. and they blame fed-ex..
5,Excellent,"I just received it today, nice briquet, looks different than other jeans, loved itarrived on timeeverything is EXCELLENT, recommended"
1,Disappointing!,I am very disappointed with this jeans. The material is very thin and cheap feeling. I am a regular customer and have bought other Levi jeans online before but this one just was a total disappointment.
5,A Winning Christmas Gift,"I purchased these as a requested Christmas gift for my forty-something year old son. I was doubtful that they would be long enough as he specified a length two inches shorter than he normally wears, but he showed me that they were indeed a perfect fit. He seemed very pleased with them--hence my five-star rating."
2,Thin fabric jeans,These are made from very light weight denim. They don't feel like Levi's. Previously I wore 512 slim fit. They were great. These have been discontinued. (The 512 number now is now a women's jean.) The 511 men's jean is very inferior to the old 512.
3,not true 514,i have been wearing levi 514 for many years and these are definately not the 514 im used too!!they are not slim fit but actually quite baggie!!..material and zipper are cheap!!
2,"""Jealous"" version is a completely different fit than standard 514","I wear 514's all the time, and I liked the color combo on the ""Jealous"" wash. However, this model of the 514 is COMPLETELY different than standard 514's - it's significantly baggier throughout, and the legs almost have a flare to them. Mega-disappointed in this version of the 514, as I buy them for their slim and fitted vibe."
5,great fit and style,These jeans are a great fit - not too baggy - and they look great on. Great for guys who don't want their jeand hanging down below their underwear.
1,This is a defective product !,"This is my first time to buy things on Amazon, I like Levi's pants, but the prices are high. Concessions to his son to buy a few obvious white lines on a pair of pants knee, mid-term, is defective.From buy shipped back to China for some time, returned to the high cost of the I bear it?"
3,Too Baggy,"I had bought the same jeans a week ago but a different wash and they fitted me perfectly. True to the size. This one, however, is loose and seems a bit longer. I don't even feel like wearing these jeans. Seriously."
1,Higly unsatisfied,"The jeans are coarse, and definitely do not represent a Levi's pair. After wearing them a couple of times, I've thrown them away. Now, I've sworn never to buy jeans online."
1,Did not like Quality of fabric & sizing.,Not pleased with the type of fabric used and also the sizing was not acceptable. I would not recommend this product.
2,Not the same old Levi's,"Levi's used to be the best product money can buy... Not any more. The lack of quality in this pair of jeans is truly disappointing. The fabric is now lighter and thinner than ever before and the seams are no longer double stitched as they were in the past. Even by picking them up you will notice the lack of quality greatly than a pair purchased even 2 years ago. Levi's better step up their game, and stop outsourcing. I don't care if I have to pay thirty bucks more, I need my clothing to last!"
1,decepcionado,"estoy muy decepcionado con estes pantalon levis 514, a pesar que fue hecho en mexico la tela del pantalon no es gruesa como los otros levis que existen en el mercado; tengo un levis 527 la tela es fuerte resistente. no recominedo este levis 514 no parece original"
5,Thank you,"HelloThe item is very good and i like it because of the following things:on time, size as expected high quality"
2,"poor quality, too thin and soft to be a jeans","The materials use for this 514 dirt rush jeans is no good, too soft and thin and is more like a cargo pants. size wise is too baggy for slim straight, way more baggy than regular straight......"
3,I wonder if it's a fake one,"I have an old Levis 514 for 2years, and I found it's different from the old one when I recieved this new one. It's thin and light, and not comfortable. However, I still don't beleive Amazon sold fake jeans. so, I give 3 stars"
3,Kind of stiff,My son didn't like the feel of the denim. Too stiff and scratchy. It didn't have the soft worn feel that teenagers like.
1,Very thin jeans,"My son has 514's that fit very well, so I bought these. I knew the color would probably not be the same, but that was ok. However, the jean material is so thin. I'm not sure if these were a different version of the 514's, but I don't like them. They are way too thin. They do not feel like jeans."
4,"Nice-looking, well-fitting jeans.",I had never worn a pair of Levis before so I decided to give them a try. I must say they fit well and feel very comfortable. Overall they are pretty nice and well worth the price.
4,"Comfortable and Stylish, a little baggier than I expected","These jeans look great and they're very comfortable. I was a little surprised by how baggy the bottom of the legs are, though. They're actually wider than the legs of my Straight 505s. I figured being slim, they'd be a little closer fitting than the 505s. But that said, they really are great jeans!"
2,lackluster Pants,"I love Levi's. However, the ones that I buy in store are made in Egypt and Mexico. They fit great and I love them. However, the ones that came in the mail are made in China, and did not fit, were not the same material, and I was very disappointed. So I returned them, went down to JCPenney and shoveled out an extra 10 dollars for a good pair of pants."
1,Poor quality jeans,Disppointed in the quality of these jeans.The crotch and back pocket ripped within one week of receiving.The denim seemed as flimsy as rice paper.
5,Great fit.,"These are a great fitting pair of jeans. Not too tight, and not too loose. I purchased a pair from Macy's, but I ordered the wrong size, but that was my fault. I went to order the right size and the price went up $15. then I checked the next day and they went back down, then I went to purchase later in the day and they went back up, so I decided to check Amazon. I found them here at the sale price, and the price seams to stay the same. I ordered them and received them in two day, and they are great.The end."
2,Paper thin material,"Don't be fooled. These ""jeans"" look like jeans from the outside, but in reality are made of a very thin material. These are about 1/2 the weight of typical blue jeans. On the positive side, they do fit me well, but are definately not what I was expecting."
1,quality control????,"after wearing these jeans, i noticed the left leg was over 1/2 an inch shorter than the right. never even crossed my mind to check the length of the legs. too late to return, i guess. NOT happy with the quality of the product. i figured Levi's would have some quality control or they are just getting rid of their ""seconds"" through amazon."
3,slightly defective,"Bottom hem on right leg was not only stitched uneven, but stitch also unraveling one inch. Luckily I know a seamstress that will fix for free, but if I had to send back to exchange would be more of a pain."
4,get one size bigger.,"All my other jeans are size 33. I had to go with size 34 for the 514. This is my favorite Levi's fit, not loose and not tight, just right. They're so cheap I won't feel bad if something happens to them. Perfect work jeans in my opinion. Only Not the softest pair but with a few washes I'm sure they're gonna start softening up."
1,"Levi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Jean, Dirt Rush, 33x32. !CRAP¡",Levis Jean is POOR quality of texture. Made In Mexico like imitation. Nada cerca de los pantalones que antes compraba. No recommend.
2,"great fit, poor quality","i've bought many levi's jeans, been fan of them because of their quality and durability, now this jeans seems to be breakin in any time, too soft, too delicated, I really don't know why they are making it this way.I miss the original Levi's quality"
5,Great jeans and price!,These jeans are exactly the fit my husband needed. Who knows how hard they would've been to find in a store. Fast delivery!
1,no he recibido el pedido,"Good afternoon, Mr. Amazone, I can not give an opinion on goods purchased, and so far has not been received.Required indicating the status of this order (Men's Levi's 514 Slim Straight Jean, hard dirt, 34x30)Greetings Carlos Matos"
3,Jack DeJohnette is GOD!!!,"Jack DeJohnette is my favorite drummer. I also love the way John Pattitucci plays, and Manolo Badrena is awesome. What I've heard of this album sounds cool, but nowhere near as hip as Steve Khan's album 'Public Access' with Anthony Jackson, Dave Weckl and Manolo Badrena. I don't know why Manolo Badrena doesn't have more of a solo career, he an amazing musician playing percussion and singing. Steve Khan sounds great, but I wish he would put out more albums with less straight ahead stuff. I was disappointed with the version of 'Riot', it's so much heavier on the Miles recording (was it Nefertitti or Sorcerer?). I don't know why people insist on performing the music of Miles Davis in a way that lacks the fire and intensity of the original recordings."
1,Worked exactly one time.,"I should have known better than to order one of the cheapest center punches that I could find. After I took the punch out of the package, I did a test punch, just to insure that it worked without any problems. For the initial punch it did work, albeit a light punch. It was not until a week or so later that I went to use the punch again, and this time it did nothing, no matter how I adjusted it or how hard I depressed the punch.Do yourself a favor, purchase the Starret automatic center punch that Amazon has listed. It will provide you with a lifetime of trouble free service."
2,Didn't work out for me...,This light duty center punch is a little bit TO light duty: the hardened tip broke off inside the unit and dropped out onto the floor after only about thirty punches (into plastic). Not a very long service life...
4,Great information,"Great analysis of the evolution of Civil Law. Gives the reader an understanding of the sociological and political context in which institutions arose. To learn more on the topic, consider José de Jesus Ledesma's books in Spanish and Italian. They are great."
2,ending ruined it.,i work in a library i found the book when i was put away books it was on the wrong place. anyway i looked at it and thought it sonded intresting. i my self have learning diabilties. at frist i liked this book somes of the terms used are outdated but i thats bescause the book was written in the 70s. but what really killed the book for me was the reaction of the too kids in the normal class at the end. i want the book to end hapy for john and deedee. however if you can find the book read it because you might like it.
2,Overrated,"It is difficult to learn slang from a book, even when the book is well written. Learning it from this book is to do yourself a disservice...ask anyone who speaks French as their first language. And David Burke's recorded voice is always annoying."
2,"Nice product, strange design","Very quality made, except mine must have been somehow defective as the cans did not roll down from front to back on the top level - they just rolled out the back. There are no adjustable pieces to move to prevent the cans (at least in mine) from just rolling out. Not sure if they were all made this way (I assume not based upon the other feedback) or if I just received a dud. Quality made and materials aside from the design flaw on mine."
4,Toddler Coddler,"This item was great. The only problem I have is that my car does not have head rests in the back seat, so I had to attatch it a little differently.Other than that, I think it is a great product."
3,Lalique gift box,"Fine OdT, business as usual, OK shower gel, but disappointing After shave ""balm"". It is simply watery and unsatisfactory.The price is good, though."
5,Go to shoe,"This is my third pair of this model of shoe from Birkenstock; my second smooth leather. I much prefer the smooth leather to the suede. I really like the high/normal arch. I wear these pretty much every day, mostly around the house, but i do drive in them and go out to the store, shopping etc. I do not wear to work which requires business casual, and these don't quite do it. The shoe does not fall off the foot when walking or driving, due to the footbed having the arch and a depression for the toes and heel. I will definitely buy again."
2,incorrect description for these shoes!,"Birkenstock does indeed make ""high-arch"" shoes. I own several pair, and I live in them because I have problem feet. When I saw these clogs called ""high-arch"" I was ecstatic! But, they are NOT high-arch Birkenstocks, which have extra high arches, with the words HIGH ARCH actually printed in the shoes. So, these have to go back. What a disappointment!Yes, I know I can get the real deal from Birkenstock, but in one color only. I was so excited that I could (I thought) get them in different colors.Amazon -- please change your description for these clogs."
3,"Not Clarke's best, IMHO","Bought it on vinyl, and I still have the cassette tape I made from it then. Not bad, but I like ""School Days"" much more."
4,...One Little Problem,"Okay-""Stanley Clarke"" is a fantastic album,filled withdelectable Larry Graham,pre-Louis Johnson electric slap bass playing and a funky back up rhythm section including RTF synthplayer Jan Hammer-two tracks of note are the super groovalistic""Vulcan Princess"" and ""Lopsy Lu"".But it is on the former'sinterlude ""Yesterdays Princess"" that we have to listen loud and clear to this albums single flaw-it's only reason for me to deduct one star from it's rating;Stanley Clarke ""attempts"" to sing and we learn that this master of the bass IS mortal indeed.Yech-but even musically that track AND it's five companions makethis a five-star album all around.Ignore the singing on cut 2 andyou've got an album fit for a king!"
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed when I received it....I could not believe how small this toy was for the amount of money I paid.
3,Unfortunately not as good as i expected,"As I say in my title, this album was not as good as I expected it to be. Having been introjeced to Ginny Owens by the track Fellow Traveler, which is on the album, i expected the rest of the album to follow this standard as in, have tracks which were simular. it does at times, but then toehrsothers, Owens sings in what i can only describe as a ""put on"" jazz type voice doesn'doesn't suit her at all. it also takes away from the tone of the album, a little disappointment i would have to say at points when this occurs. I do not listne to the tracksOverall, sometimes good, sometimes not so much.."
2,Earlier was better,"I have so enjoyed Miss Owens' songs. ""Own Me"" is a particular favorite. This albumn just didn't click with me..."
3,All N' All + I Am = Faces = Uh-Oh!,"This album had the unfortunate task of living up to it's two predecesors:""All N' All"" & ""I Am"".On ""I Am"",the elements sold out. Someone at Columbia Records (now Sony Records) figured ""Why don't we make ""All N' All"" meets ""I Am"" ,call it ""Faces"" and put it on 2 vinyl records to really clean up? Although ""Faces"" has some good tracks on it,it'll never be ""That's The Way Of The World"" or ""All""."
3,Too much of a good thing?,"""FACES"", EWF's 12th album, reminds me of Fleetwood Mac's ""TUSK"". Both were double-albums that followed a pair of hugely successful projects, and both seem to suffer, in only in comparison. All the usual things one comes to expect from EWF are here: the sense of joy & wonder, great playing, stunning production. I just don't think the songs stand out as much as on most other albums. ""Let Me Talk"", ""Turn It Into Something Good"", ""Pride"" (what power!) and ""You"" (another gorgeous love ballad co-written by David Foster, just prior to his ""taking over"" of the band CHICAGO) are all nice. After that it starts to get a bit lost. Like a number of recent albums on CDs, ""FACES"" might have been even better than it is with a few tunes left off."
3,SO<SO,"I've had this sweeper for several months now. The battery is much better than the original Shark, but it's not as powerful, so it's just so,so. I do like the way it empties though. very easy & neat."
5,Pro shark V1725,"I have purchased four sharks i have had one for over a year and love it for the kitchen ,also handy to store and use. My friends also wanted them and so I am responsiable for selling four of them .would highly recomend . I took it ito our club house and was sure nice to just go around the tables .Arlene Peterson"
2,Shark Vac,Was very disappointed on how cheaply made it was. I have bought several and this one is by far a lower quality that is available.
4,Love my Shark,"I really love my Shark. I use it daily and haven't had any problems with it. I do take it apart about once a month (due to daily pick up of hair and dirt) to clean it. All you have to do is pop off the wheels and the front black roller cover. Then take out all the screws (10) using a standard screwdriver. Once the screws are out, the top comes apart from the bottom, now you can pull the belt off the roller and clean the roller, and all that dirt that is clumped up. You'll notice improved performance as soon as you do this."
2,Great if it worked!,I have had this for 6 months and it does not hold a charge. It was great when it worked but it did not last long. I have not used it very much but now it is too late to return it.
4,LOVE this gadget,It might just replace my vacuum. I use it every day for five minutes and it works great. What a great idea! Wish they'd had this years ago. It sure gets rid of puppy hair in a hurry.
3,Decent for small pickups,Good enough for small jobs. My three-year old can operate it with ease. It is not powerful enough to replace a good broom or swiffer. Great for nightly under-the-table sweep-ups but not much else.
2,Save your money,"Euro-Pro V1725 Shark Quick-and-Quiet 10-Inch Cordless Sweeper]]The worst, no suction, no power, had different version of this that worked great, not this one, too weak for much of anything. Would not recommend."
3,Good for when toddlers are in the house,This picks up large things like crackers/pieces of food that children drop. Not so great with tiny pieces of dirt. Still a decent sweeper for quick clean up.
1,"Bought as ""New"" and got it ""used""","ordered item as ""new"" and when I got it it had a return receipt stapled to inside lid that said ""missing parts"" and had to return item, they didn't have any more, and still waiting for my credit."
2,Euro-Pro Shark,This was purchased for a Christmas present for my Mom. I had one but didn't like it. She had one and loved it...actually wore it out...so I bought her another one.
2,Short Battery Life,"It's a great little sweeper -- for the life of the battery, which is very short. Ours lasted a couple of months. The instructions give an initial charge time, but I couldn't find a recharge time listed. There is no light to indicate when full charge is reached. I would pay double the price if the battery problem were corrected."
4,Great,The ssword is BEAUTIFUL it's a great sword for swinging around and it makes a great piece of art in any room.If you are looking to buy a sharp double cutting edge Katana this is not what you want.The cutting edge is not sharp at ALL.
4,Really Cool Katana!,"This katana is very well made!Mine arrived and it was bigger and longer than I expected it to be.It is one of the coolest katanas I've ever seen..and for such a great price! The sharp part of this blade wasn't that sharp at all,to my disappointment, but none of the other katanas I've held have ever really had sharp blades either,so I didn't mind that too much.This sword is a bit heavier and larger than most katanas and is cool to have to put on a table or on the wall for others to admire as well.Every now and then,I do pick it up and swing it around a bit, but it is mostly an awesome collector's item.The stand it comes with is very flimsy though,so be careful not to try to prop this thing up on the stand and put it on a glass tabletop or anything,because it will probably fall off the stand and crack the glass."
5,An Exceptional Album. A True Gem. Great Engineering and Music.,"The more I listen the better it gets. It's a shame these guys have dis-banded according to their site. Anyway, if you like Kino, Arena, Porcupine Tree etc......the you will love this. This ranks right up there with the best of them. Personally I like it better than any of Arenas music (which is good too) and it's by far a better engineered album than the Kino release. A good system will make this music shine and you'll be happy you have it. Ipod users you will never experience this music the way it was meant to be heard. A great recording. Plenty of low and high end with good depth and soundstage. Some very intricate musicianship in parts of this album that will make you want to listen to it over again. Overall a truly great album.If you're a true prog fan get this album before it disappears for good. You'll be happy you did!"
5,The best new music I have heard in a long time,"This album is my new favorite; very well written, diverse, technical and with soul.It's fresh and original without trying to work to a format.I can't wait for the follow up album due next month!"
5,One of the Best,"Ellen Gilchrist is one of the best. She has the ability to craft interesting and fascinating characters. The first thing I read of hers was a short story in a magazine and I have read everything since. I never miss one of her books, and I'm proud to have the complete collection on my bookcase.She has crafted a series of books with interwoven characters. It isn't a series as much as a set of related novels from the different perspectives of the different characters she has created. She is a poet-novelist; I look forward to reading whatever comes next."
2,Admirable effort - Updated review,"While I believe the author believes something happened to her, it was hard to determine what that something was. Her book, which maybe self-published, is in serious need of editing. With a little editing perhaps I, the reader, would have been better able to understand her story.On a positive note, and this is the book's charm, is the book is written in diary format. You do get a personal recounting of her unique experiences.Updated Comment: I have experienced the paranormal so I can empathize with the author's experiences.Buy the book, if you'd like to read a personal account from a self-proclaimed UFO abductee."
5,"Weather Report at their peak, shortly before disbanding.","A great all-around effort. I wasn't really turned on a whole lot by their previous release, ""Mr. Gone"", and this was a great comeback. Buy this album, if for no other reason, the stellar performance and writing of Jaco Pastorius. ""Three Views of a Secret"" is one of the most hauntingly beautiful compositions to ever appear on a W.R. album (or any other album, for that matter). ""Fast City"" absolutely amazes me and escalates my pulse rate out of control. ""Madagascar"" tends to drag on and on, but what a great ending, building to a tremendous level of intensity. A refreshing album, not to far from the end of a landmark group's career."
2,Virtuosic but uncreative,"Jazz fans must have been thrilled when Weather Report left the studio experiments of Mr. Gone behind. Unfortunately, Night Passage doesn't really go anywhere. There's some cool improvisation (this was the jazziest WR album since I Sing the Body Electric) but the compositions themselves are mostly generic fusion. Wayne Shorter only contributes ""Port of Entry"", a sort of ""Elegant People""-lite but easily the best tune on here. (Shorter also plays a lot of great tenor saxophone on this album.) Jaco Pastorius offers ""Three Views of a Secret"" and the band does a really cheesy cover of Ellington's ""Rockin' in Rhythm"". Zawinul does the rest of the songwriting and with the exception of ""Fast City"", it's unremarkable. Those who are interested in the chops of Peter Erskine and Jaco Pastorius will like the album but others may just be bored."
4,the ottoman empire in the reign of Abdul Hamid,"The great saga of a people that could not be eliminated from the face of the earth. 1895 was the year and the reign of terror that could not end the Armenian race. This book is a masterpiece of Historical fact. A not to be lost history of a great Race. Memorable people , passionate events and a prayer for peace. The history of the Middleast brought to life. I loved this book and how it took me there ..even as I hated the horror:I was rivited to the facts of the place and time."
4,This book captures the essense of the problems of AVPD,"As a student studying psychology, I found the book Distancing to be very helpful in establishing connections to several personality features not mentioned in the DSM-IV. One of these features is anger. According to Kantor, when avoidants passively fear rejection they will often produce that rejection by mere excess and/or ill-suited anger (Kantor, 1993: 42). The subject of anger was not a major focus in the book, but it provides new avenues into research of the avoidant personality. It is possible that aviodence may, in fact, have a strong connection to voilent behavior when combined with sexual frustration. The frustration of rejection (or fear of) may result in violent acts perpetrated against vulnerable targets such as women, children, or even men as was the case with Jeffery Dahmer."
5,Best Chopper I have ever used,"I have used this one for several years and ordered a second one to have as a back up.....well, the second one is still in the box as the FIRST one still works very well after 4 1/2 years."
3,Not sure it does everything the ad says,"I've been testing the NicerDicer in my kitchen. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the manual says that one top section is for small dicing and julienne, and the other is for small dicing and julienne. For me, the small blade ONLY dices and the large blade ONLY juliennes. How might I get this thing to produce a large dice or a small julienne? I can't figure it out.I'm happy with the product's ease of use, but think the infomercial overpromises."
2,TOMATO FAILURE!,"I had high hopes for the Nicer Dicer, but after trying 2 of themand returning them both, I quit wanting this product. Why? It doesn't ""dice"" tomatoes, it SQUASHES them, and they are turned into mush, not even going through the slicing blades.I called Customer service and was told the buy hard tomatoes. I did that and that was the last straw...no change, no diced tomatoes! Phooey!Disappointed in Florida"
3,"Man, must all good things come to an end?","I guess I never really make myself popular writing up negative reviews but nothing is worse than spending money on bad music. The entire supperclub series have been a joy sofar. I think this is the weakest compilation though. Sure, CD1 has some great individual tracks (Royskopp's sparks, Thievery Corp's liberation front) & and I must say it's better mixed than the previous volumes but it also has absolute crab tracks on it (like Doris Days, Funky Lowlives etc.) The same goes for CD2. In the end, I find myself skipping tracks or fast forwarding stuff and that is just the opposite of what you should do when listening to lounge or good groovy vocal house. I guess the CD series are a great reflection of what is happening to the actual supperclub. It used to be such a great great place but it's lost it's edge and became just another tourist attraction in AmsterdamSigh! In any case, you are better of buying one of the previous volumes, I recommend volume 3."
1,nothing like pictured,"This item is nothing like pictured. ""diamonds"" are raised bits of silvery metal. ""emeralds"" are dull, poorly cut and set."
3,Not as pictured,The trim kit that you receive is not as pictured. There is a blue/red gauge on the trim in the photo but not on the trim when received. I did exchange it but received the same item again. Be aware.
1,Faulty conclusion,"The author starts off by showing the lack of methodology of the software industry and how many problems it has.But to go from there to reuiring licensing for a select group with ties to each other is just throwing in burocracy without solving the problem. It will create an ""in group"" with a leg up on choice jobs, bnut do nothing to ensure better quality. A license means you have some knowledge, but is no assurance that you are good at what you do. Its a false sense of security."
2,McConnell is human after all,"McConnell's previous books Code Complete and Software Project Survival Guide are great books by an expert, and on his topic of expertise. I highly recommend them. But this book is more like a series of editorials by a non-expert (at least not on the subjects of business, economics and public policy).For example, McConnell recommends government licensing of software engineers without addressing the free-market alternatives or the important negative effects of government licensing in all other industries. He apparently thinks that the only objections come from adolescent anti-authority types, when in fact there are many important objections from genuine experts of business/economics/public policy.Most of McConnell's regulars who have not read more thorough books on these topics will of course not even know what is missing in McConnell's book. They might think the issues are as simple as McConnell implies. They are not."
3,Good info for those who don't already know it,"I didn't learn very much from this book--primarily because it covered so much ground that I was already familiar with, as a member of the ACM and IEEE Computer Society. Basically, After the Gold Rush is Steve McConnell's 150-page treatise on the current and proposed future state of the software engineering profession. McConnell examines, compares and contrasts software engineering with other engineering disciplines, and concludes that if we are to build more consistently reliable software systems, then we must elevate programming from a craft to a true engineering profession. The remainder of the book details how this can be accomplished. So, while I was already familiar with the difference between an education in information systems versus computer science versus software engineering, and was already familiar with the contents of the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), others may find this book very illuminating."
5,Great product,These staples fit our staple gun and have a sharp point on the ends so they staple through almost anything.
5,Exactly the place to start from with high energy physics,"This books supplies what everyone needs when coming to nuclear and particle physics, a good beginning. It is intuitive and very clear and nice to read, allthough it wont supply the math rigour a grad student needs but will give an undergrad some idea of these subjects. Griffith has done a similar good job in electrodynamics (allthough there is more rigour in math)"
4,Soup drinkers,Any Warhammer 40K Astartes series is good enough to read once. I've started reading the Horus Heresy and it is amazing storytelling.
4,Soul Drinkers,"I like the books very much,its telling how this chapter becomes fallen,and at same time its fight to stay alive and no become a chaos legion.Im not sure i liked the last books ending so much,because now the chapter which is already weakened,just when its rebuilding is ready to break apart again,i would have liked to see more books in between showing Sarpedon and his mutated marines save guard troopers on worlds overun by chaos or tyranids etc.The book's story lines jump too much,i liked it better atleast when the went into more detail on how they moved into their new home,the space hulk,also through out the imperium their are tons of planets fallen or lost,i would have liked to see more detail and more stories in between."
3,Great Fluff,"I think the other reviews of these novels are a little over the top. It's a satisfying read and if you're a fan you'll appreciate that the world is done right. That being said it's written very badly. In the first book there are paragraphs that don't make sense. There is a lot of repeating the same word over and over again (Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot).I enjoyed these books but 5 stars is excessive, it's actually just mediocre sci-fi at best and at worst it's a hack job."
1,"Unbelieveable, but sadly true...","That someone actually based ANOTHER book on a book and film that, collectively, are worth about a sixteenth of a star as far as ""art"" (HA!) intellect or intelligence go. This is one of those juvenile,pretentious books that should never have been printed. Unless Baumbach is a nom de plume for the original ""author"" (shudder to use that word for this level of junk; how about ""person responsible for""?) of DUG, it makes one almost cry for what's happening to literacy in this country."
1,This Book is Fiction,"As someone who was involved in this search, I believe this book is not telling the actual story. It does not talk about all of the search dogs completely falling apart and not really searching and also does not talk about the temper tantrum that led to this search. It is also so full of flowery prose and language that a diabetic would go into sugar shock. I do not recommend this book except as a work of fiction."
4,It is what I was looking for,"It works fine for a slip. I wanted a black 28"" length, and this fit the bill. It washes up fine, too."
5,You can NEVER have to many Christmas CD's,"This CD is fantastic! Don't be fooled into thinking this is just a rehash of old music, this CD contains NEW recordings by the artsists you've come to know and love. the title of the CD (The Night Before Christmas) pretty much sums up the mood this CD puts you in. Very peacful and relaxing music that has always been a Windham experience. If you love Windham Hill recordings you will love this CD. Each track is masterfully performed and I can honestly say, theres not a track on here that I do not like. Each song complements the other and sustains the mood throughout. I am glad to add this to my growing Windam Hill collection. Those worried that SONY will ruin the Windham label, put those fears to rest after you've listened to this CD.Good Music, just what I'd expect from Windham Hill."
2,Wished I would have bought the other one,"I didn't think the manufacturer made a difference. I thought all parking guides were the same. I bought this one because was less expensive than the other ones I was looking at. I'm pretty sure I would have been happier with a more flexible model.This Racor unit is HARD, inflexible plastic. This means it SLIDES across your garage floor. My Mother In Law has a flexible, bright yellow parking guide and it doesn't move. She doesn't have to tape hers to the floor. She donesn't have to learn fancy parking maneuvers to avoid it from slipping. Hers ""just works"". Mine does not ""just work"".Rather than return it, I'm going to try gluing a flexible rubbery surface to the bottom of this unit. Like some old rubbery mouse pads. Something to give this device some badly-needed friction.If I had to do it again, I'd make sure that the parking guide I was buying said that it was flexible and ""grippy"" to floor surfaces."
5,Simply Works as Advertised,"I've been using this product to protect text and Word files for some time now, and it's as simple as can be. You can put your files on your hard disk or on a memory key and know they are safe. I suggest you pick a favorite poem or song and use three or four words from it as your password phrase, it's easy to type, hard to guess, and most importantly, easy for you to remember. You can even write down the first few letters or first word to jog your memory without compromising it. Otherwise, you would be amazed how easy it is to forget a password after only a few weeks of non-use."
3,Can't believe everything you read,"These are quality staples; however, they did not fit my older model Craftsman stapler. The product info states that it fits Craftsman staplers; however, it should read ""some Craftsman staplers""."
3,Didn't work for my stapler,"I must be missing something. I have a craftsmen that uses 1/2"" staples, but these are no where near the same size. They were too cheap to bother sending back. My rating is nothing against the product, since it didn't fit."
1,Poor Quality,"We only used this product six times and the coating began flaking off the wire rack first, and then the pans. Not wanting to eat Nordic's coating I put the wire rack in the trash and stopped using the pans. Not sure why I haven't disposed of the pans. Perhaps I'll use them to clean small automotive parts? I certainly will not cook in them!"
2,S,The items are kind of small for many uses. I do not recommend them unless you need small containers. Oh well!
4,Good product,"I thought it was gonna be bigger. I guess I didn't read the fine print.Oh well, it's a nice pan set."
1,No so much what I want it.,I was very disappointed with the product. It looks big on line. When I saw the product I almost cry. So small but is ok to cook small things.
4,smaller oven less mess,this is a great product my kids use it all the time. However it is a little small for my b&d space saver toaster oven
1,Disappointed!,"I've used the baking sheet of this set maybe 10 times in my toaster over and the teflon is already flaking off. I was very suprised, since I've been careful cleaning it so as not to scratch the teflon, but the teflon is peeling off anyway. So, don't waste your money on this product."
2,2/?,"Was going to buy until i read the reviews. 1st. ? is if all or most all report teflon pealing off so fast, why is it still available? 2nd. ? is why the sizes are not listed ? The product in which i'm refering to is the 3 pcs. Nordic Ware Toaster Oven Baking set.. Sorry about putting cart before the horse... Smoothbore00...."
3,better than most Spike Lee movies,"I saw Spike Lee's MIRACLE AT ST ANNA and then THE RINGER the next day on TV. THE RINGER is pretty much mindless light entertainment fare not the cinematic work of art you may have been led to believe. It stars Johnny Knoxville who is used to performing with mentally challenged people. He plays a guy that pretends to be ""special"" so he can compete in the Special Olympics and win. This is kinda hard actually. Of course the premise is absurd. An especially funny moment is when he's outed by the special athletes he's staying with. The real life disabled people that star in the movie were funny and I guess it's OK to laugh when everybody laughs. Bottom line: I'll take a movie like this over MIRACLE AT ST ANNA and most Spike Lee films any time. (WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE was good. So was THE 25th HOUR.)"
3,Could Have Been So Much Better...,"Let me start by saying that I liked this movie. Johnny Knoxville did a great job playing a guy who pretends he is mentally challenged so he can enter the Special Olympics. I think they handled the subject with class and it didn't turn into a mean spirited movie. A lot of the supporting cast were hilarious and often stole the show away from Johnny Knoxville, which was just awesome! The problems I have with this movie have to do with the plot. There were many funny scenes and jokes throughout, but the story itself felt like it was just thrown together. It was almost like they didn't know how to end it, so they just decided to end it. The love story part of the movie wasn't believable to me at all, and I know this movie is a comedy and far fetched to begin with but I just didn't feel the magic between the two main stars. I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars because it was funny, but I don't think it is a great movie by any stretch of the imagination."
3,It was not that funny,but the story was pretty good. I thought the acting was done very well. I just wish it had more laughs in it.
2,They are inexpensive- now we know why,"The compasses were very inexpensive, so we were thrilled. We purchased 30 and have used about 12, of which 3 or 4 were unusable because the tightening nut is stripped out - in other words you can't tighten it to hold in any position. This makes the tool useless! I need to purchase more in the future- hopefully another brand."
2,TINY LITTLE GUY,"Wow was I surprised when this item arrived,I guess I assumed it was a bigger compass. This thing is tiny.about the size of a pack of chewing gum.It's a nice tool, well made and all that but, boy is it dinky.It works well and for little stuff this is an o.k. tool I'm still shopping around for a larger version. Now get out there and make some circles."
3,A Marines Story,I love military books but I have found this one a hard read. As of this time I still have not finished the book. Some might find this a good read. It's too slow for me.
5,durable r/c trainer,One of the best ways to start r/c flying is with the Begin Air because of it's durable body. You could crash it many times and fixed it with Elmer's glue and packing tape. I rented the flight simulator from Parkflyer's and that pushed me towards success even faster. Right now I am moving up to the Cessna 182 pro deluxe and hoping i could start doing tricks really soon with its trainer.
3,Not The Best Rockpile Has To Offer,"To me, the highlight of this re-release of the 1980 vinyl LP is the inclusion of the 4 bonus tracks that originally comprised a 6-inch EP that accompanied early copies of this recording. Entitled ""Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe Sing the Everly Brothers"", these were such faithful and loving covers of songs by Don and Phil that I was saddened to lose my original copy in a house fire.Inasmuch as this band (Edmunds, Lowe, Billy Bremner, Terry Williams), played together on virtually all of Dave and Nick's solo recordings from '77-'80, there are, IMHO, far better examples of Rockpile's output then what is otherwise found here. I suggest either Edmunds ""Get it"", ""Tracks on Wax 4"", and ""Repeat When Necessary"" or Lowe's ""Pure Pop for Now People"" (known in the UK as ""Jesus of Cool"")."
4,Good Ol'Rock-N-Roll Delight,"More should have came from this group. As an initial offering, its a great start. Most of the cuts are well done rockers, but there are one or two that seem like they don't fit. Nevertheless, a well done piece and the bonus tracks are the image of the ""Kaylan Twins"". (You'll have to buy it to understand). Excellent price, I might add, as well!"
1,eForCity Replacement Battery for Your Creative Zen Micro Mp3 Player Lithium Ion... eForCity,"The battery came in on time even though no information about the shipment was provided by the seller.The battery does not seem to be alright, as it does not charge completely. At least, battery charge level indicator shows empty even after a full charge and does not hold enough power.Not happy with this product."
5,Great product,"This is a great alternative to the original, more expensive battery. It's take only a short time to charge up on my laptop and the charge lasts for at least three days before I have to hook it up again. Don't bother buying the more expensive kind this one works great for alot less!!"
3,Awesome tone quality with a lack of stable clips,"These headphones have an awesome tone quality. The clips work well for commuters, yet runners will experience that the cord pulls the left clip out of the ear. The reason for this is that the cord carries weight due to the connecters. The clips are not stable enough. They move around easy and cause a shift in size. Overall these headphones deserve 3 out of 5 stars."
2,Buy it for the Neal Adams art.,"Ra's Al Ghul always seemed to be a Batman villain with a lot of potential. This collection was not the definitive, ultimate Ra's Al Ghul tale I thought it might be. I think that story may still yet to have been written. The Neal Adams art is beautiful and just about worth the cover price alone. However, Neal's art only graces the pages of three of the stories collected here. In fact, Ra's Al Ghul himself fails to show up in two entire stories and makes only a cameo appearance in a third. Not what I expected. Oh yeah, and the entire collection has been re-colored in a modern style which is NOT an improvement. Another complaint of mine would be that we find out in these issues that Ra's Al Ghul is Batman's most dangerous foe. How do we know that? The comics tell us that. It didn't seem like anything happened to appoint Ra's to that position, suddenly Batman just begins thinking statements like that to himself."
2,Re: A big Let-down,"The Tales of the Demon should never have been collected in the first place, the stories barely fit together and leaves a lot of questions. Very little about Ras Al Ghul is actually revealed in a collection entitled ""Tales of the Demon"". Batman is shown as a joke telling superhero with little or nore of the dark qualities that we had become used to since the last two decades. But I guess the story telling style is simply unappealing to modern readers because it is so old and rather incoherent. I really wouldn't recommend this for any Batman Fans."
1,Misrepresented item,"If you typed in ""UC36W1006"" and this came up, it is about 6 inches too short and they make you have to call to return it. Do not get this one. It's $15 cheaper and has prime, so I bought it. Don't make the same mistake. This ad is a lie."
3,Just Measure from the 2 Inch mark,"The rule is off on one end so you can't use the entire rule to measure. But I usually start measuring from the 2 inch mark anyway in case I dent the edges of measuring tools. It seems to be pretty accurate apart from that. But I wouldn't recommend it if you need the entire 12 inches or for extremely accurate measuring. Other than that I love how thin it is, the different views on the scale and the etched in markings."
4,Good but not the same,I've used these types of rules for years and always liked General. Overall the rule seems precise enough. The tick marks are nice and finely etched. They are much finer than my older General rule which helps separate the lines better.The thing that I don't like is that General is using a less springy steel now. The new rule bends easily and stays bent. This isn't an issue if you never bend the rule. But there are quite a few times when I use a 12 inch rule with one end bent to fit around irregular shaped objects. My old General rule can nearly create a complete circle and return to flat. Not so with this new one. Too bad since its flexibility is why I bought another one.It's still a nice product but I wish the steel were better.
5,perfect fit on my Odyssey -- note... this is for the back cargo when you use the third seat up,"works great, perfect fit.Picture is incorrect.This is for the cargo area when you have the third row seat up."
4,Great DVD Cabinet,"I bought this cabinet because I felt it offered the best value for the price. Also, I liked the look of it. The only downside is that my husband said it was kind of a pain to put together."
3,Not as in depth as you would expect,"I am a big fan of Brian Eno, but this DVD was a bit disappointing. There was too much of Will Wright and not enough of Brian Eno. This is just a video of a lecture, and while the video is good for a lecture, I expected more since Brian Eno was a part of it. Will Wright does give a demo of Spore on this DVD, and he does most of the talking, occasionally asking for input from Brian Eno. Certainly there is some insight into Brian Eno's work, but I expected more.This is also a very minimal DVD, it is just the video of the lecture, that is it, no extras."
1,gone back in 60 seconds,i received this arrow fastener t25 low quality wire staple gun and returned it very soon after. the thing just CONSTANTLY jams up! i went through 2 rows of staples and only about 10 of those actually went into the wall. the rest got stuck in the head of this thing and had to be extracted with needle nose pliers. i would either try the most expensive arrow wire fastener or avoid arrow all together because their mid line of staplers seem to be poor quality. goodluck if you order this thing
2,It can use improvement,I would give these chocks second thoughts if I had to use them on hard surfaces likeconcrete or asphalt . It seems it would slip on these surfaces since the chocks are entirely made of plastic .They are strong but it would have been better if the company incorporated rubber on the bottom toavoid slippage . They are OK for dirt and gravel surfaces .My primary use for them are for a light utility trailer . I would never use these chocks for cars or light trucks . Too risky !
1,Dont buy this,I bought these for my mower while on my trailer.I stuck them both under the rear wheels and drove away.When I reached my next yard my mower was smashed into the rear of the trailer.Bottom line these are made of plastic and hard plastic slides on most any surface.A block of wood works better.Even a stick out of the yard
5,Another Hubby gift,"Hubby loves to ""do it yourself"" and is great at it..bought these to make sure he is safe when he does it..great price and delivery and they work perfectly with ramps purchased. Now i do not worry when he is working on the vehicles"
1,Wow Tiny,"Gosh, when you buy wheel chocks, you would expect that they are substantial enough to hold....well lets say.....at least a VW Beetle. Maybe there is a smaller car out there that I could compare the smallness of these insignificant wheel chocks, but my knee jerk is to find a kid with an assortment of Tonka Toys and offer them up."
2,Hmmmmm,"For myself, these might work? Only because my car is very small and barely weighs 1800lbs. These are not solid, they are a thinner plastic, maybe 1/4 of an inch thick. They do however stack together nicely to make it easier to store them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone, not even a Go-cart racer.When I seen RhinoGear I imagined thick sturdy rubber chock-blocks not thin plastic cups."
2,Not For Pop Up Tent Trailer,If you have a Pop Up Tent Trailer Pass on this set of chocks.This pair Would Not stay in place on Grass. I have another set of chocksthat work great. Not his pair.Now that I know which pair work the best I will buy the other brand.
1,RhinoGear wheel chocks.,"What was I thinking? What was I expecting for 4 bucks? I thought I was getting a solid hard plastic product(maybe I didn't read closely enough). Instead I got cheap hollow thin walled plastic that isn't fit to chock a tricycle, let alone a 10,0000 lb trailer. These things will obliterate the first time a tire even comes in contact. Your tongue jack, and stabilizers are the only thing that will hold you. Don't even think about using them when you disconnect from your truck unless you're on perfectly level ground. use a piece of fire wood. These things will crack like an egg in cold weather, and melt like putty on any day over 60 degrees. Isn't there some sort of safety standards for this sort of product? Don't waste your money.Wasn't even worth the time to return."
1,A bit misleading...,"These chocks are very ligth duty as you might expect by the price. Don't be fooled by the image presented, there are only two chocks supplied, not four!"
4,Works as expected,These are a great product very helpful when jacking a car or truck or if you are parked on an unusually steep hill and just want the extra edge . I do a lot better having them there only thing is you can get them for half this price at the auot parts store.
5,Cheap and effective,"These are a nice, cheap and effective way to stay safe while working under your car. Prior to purchasing these, I was always looking for a chunk of wood or other block to put behind the wheels. The Blitz product is brightly colored, making it easy to find in your garage and made from sturdy plastic. I've used their rhino ramps for years and never had an issue, and I expect no less from these chocks!"
3,Thin plastic and much smaller than envisioned... went back to using bricks for chocks,"I purchased these to ""class up"" our current utility trailer arrangement. We have a small 4' x 8' utility trailer for hauling yard waste, and small loads of rock, bark etc. up to about 1/2 yard capacity. When loading the trailer, I often use large bricks as chocks and wanted something more professional looking.It's difficult to tell from the photos how thin the plastic is and how small the overall shape really is. I simply don't trust them to hold the trailer in place - if you try to wedge them under the wheel with your shoe/toe, the plastic on the back flexes under the force. I can only see these being suitable for an empty trailer on a very level paved surface. I do not trust this with any amount of load, on a gravel surface, or anything with even a tiny bit of slope."
3,Does the job,"These are ok. they are cheap and does the job. Didnt have any issues using them to chock 20"" wheels either."
4,Compact and convenient,"My cousin used this for her daughter who is now 8. Hers was so worn out that she couldn't let me use it for my baby. That let me know that this is a useful product.I have a Mini Cooper Clubman and look for items that don't take up a lot of room. This fits the bill. It goes in the back seat easily and straps in with the seatbelt. My backseat has it tilt backward so I have to put a tightly rolled towel underneath so that the baby's head doesn't fall forward. It sounds a bit cheesy but that's from the directions.My boy is currently 15 pounds and I can still get the seat in and out easily with him in it. As he grows, I can see that this is going to be tougher. The wheels stick sometimes when converting from car seat to stroller. There's no problem going the other way.My spouse is 6' 2"" and does say that the handle is not long enough for him. I'm 5' 7"" and it's fine for me."
1,Needs to be more rugged,I am a hobbyist blacksmith and was really looking forward to using this scribe. The point broke off in my pocket when it was in the same pocket as my keys before I had a chance to use it once.
3,Deceptive ad for this item,"When I purchased this item, the ad showed 2 filters and the written decription said ""filters."" I got one filter. When I complained, I got the run around about how they should change the ad. I talked to a supervisor about the problem without any solution. Be very aware that this item has a deceptive ad and that you will not get a resolution even if you complain. I am rethinking ordering anything from Amazon again."
1,Very disappointed,I have few CDs by Liona Boyd and like most of the songs on each CD. There is no life to the music on this CD for my liking.
1,The most overrated piece of junk ever.,"This is the most misinformative book I ever read. Most of it's info are very inacccurate,most of the info about the differences between most games and it's Japanese counterparts are very inaccurate (""The girls in Final Fight,transvestites? Megaman a racist? Yeah Right!""). David Sheff should play the games themselves rather than making things up. The only reason this book was ever made was to made the 'concern parents' even more paranoid as it potrays the staff in Nintendo as Nazies. Even though,there are some info that are correct,most of it are only made up for the paranoid parents (as David Sheff used to be a former Nintendo employeee)."
1,Yick!,"This is a complete take-off on Thomas Tryon's great""Harvest Home.""Now, I read and really appreciate Robert McCammon but this book...save your time and get ""Harvest Home.""Jude"
2,"Decent, but all in all void of any true character","Quickly identifiable by McCammon fans as one of his early works, Bethany's Sin lacks the magic and rich character that made Boy's Life and Swan Song such a thrill to read. Having read the other two prior to this, I'd been hoping for something more along those lines. It's the story of a young couple who move to what they think is a normal suburban town, only to find that there's an evil that controls the people of this town. A tired theme in horror, this book doesn't show the range and ability of Robert McCammon. The characters are dull and by the end of the book I found that I really didn't care how it was going to end."
1,Product Did Not Work,"Like everyone else said: it stopped working after a short time. I haven't used one before so I thought all the slipping and not gripping might be normal, then it stopped working almost completely. I ended up renting one the next day (another brand) and got more done in a few minutes then I did in many hours with this sub-functional product. Under no circumstances would I allow a friend to purchase this product."
1,Junk,"Get a Malco 2 in 1 riveter, you won't regret spending the money. This is the worst riveter of the dozens I've used. I can't believe something like this even got out the door of quality control. Were they trying to build a tree ornament? Because it sure doesn't hold up to any riveting."
1,What a Turd!!!,"This Arrow pop rivet gun seemed like a good choice to replace my cheap no name gun that lasted for years and popped many rivets. Good steel construction, swivel head, looked and felt like a heavy duty tool. WRONG!!! After 4 rivets it would pull no more. I would have been better off just flushing $20 down the toilet!"
2,Leaks,The first one leaked to ruin my bagThey shipped me a replacement right away but this one leaks too
2,Won't last more than a year,"I've had two so far and I'm fighting the urge to get another. It's wonderful idea for certain jobs. BUT the battery begins to fail after a year. At this point, my second sweeper won't hold a charge long enough to sweep my kitchen. While I like the way this product works when new, I don't feel like spending $70 a year to keep up the pattern. Too bad the manufacturer can't get it right."
1,poor product,"I have owned this approx. 4 weeks and it has already quit working. when it worked, it did pick up more things than a regular electric broom, for example, but if you use the lowest speed (for bare floors), and you hit even a smooth rug, it jams and stops and you have to restart. also, when it was fully charged, the charge only seemed to last about 10 minutes, which is ridiculous. very unhappy with this product, and now it has quit running.whoa! all of a sudden it has started working again, but this is not an ideal situation. it runs when it wants to? am still disappointed.now a month later, have given up. the charge lasts about 8 minutes on high and the thing jams so much at the slighest piece of string, that it is a pain to use. have relegated it to the basement rummage room and bought a hoover. also, tech support from shark was worthless as well. no responses at all."
1,Insanely Bad,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who had he heard it was good. little did i know he meant from an infomercial. I live in a small apartment, and figured a sweeper/vac would be good for doing the small amount of carpet and the kitchen linoleum. I was wrong. The thing broke down within the first week, and I had to call their support line to see if I could get a replacement. They argued with me and told me i could send it in for repair - while I also paid for all the shipping. Obviously, I protested and ended up getting a free brush replacement kit since i was ""so angry"" - the replacement set helped, but now the battery only lasts about 2 minutes on a full charge. I'm planning on throwing it in the dumpster and counting the $79 as a learning experience."
1,Don't waste your money on a Shark,"The Ultra Shark cordless sweeper is a waste of time, money, and effort. I have had extensive experience (sold 50 plus) of these units. They are poorly designed, and cheaply made using poor quality parts. The stock manufacturer warranty is only 90 days (which is just when the battery will begin to lose a charge, the belt will come off, or the poorly made plastic connection to the power head will break). Operation...they do not have suction, and rely on the brush to sweep. Carpet threads, string, and wet debris quickly becomes embeded on the brush. The sales pitch on TV was impressive, and the director must have been a genuis to make such a poor performing sweeper look so much better than it does when you actually have to use it. I depend on repeat customers for sales, and with the many returns and unhappy customers I have experienced when selling the Shark Ultras, I will no longer stock and sell ANY.... Shark products."
4,A Mystical Journey,I found this mystical journey to be fun and insightful. I found myself imagining what it would be like to take a similar journey back in time -- on my own time line. What choices would I make? How would nature reconcile those choices? What would happen to the people I love today? I read it straight through and had a great time doing it. Time to read it again!
3,"Ricky still holds up his quality stamp on this CD , but this is right there in middle quality wise.","There are some slow starters to get you in the right ""Skaggs"" mood here, but on this one is the ballads who does it like the title track Track 5 Waitin for the sun to shine.On the uptempo songs he`s not up to his usual standard. There`s something missing there when you compare to CD `s like Kentucky thunder and other`s of his earlier CD`s. It`s very traditional sometimes, and you think that you have heard some of the stuff on other CD`s. In other word`s he repeat himself to much musicalwise. But anyway. A Ricky Skagg`s CD always deliver quality Bluegrass and Country music, but it`s not up there with his earlier stuff, sorry to say.More as Track 2 Don`t get above your raising, anyway lifts the quality."
1,Didn't meet our need,Was hoping that this would provide ventilation for my daughter in her new fourth floor apartment--especially in her bedroom. Unfortunately it did not provide the exhuast feature we were hoping for--was returned. Her room is not very large and she tried with door closed too. Oh well!
1,terrible fan - Holmes HAWF2043 Twin Window Fan,Do not buy this fan. The Holmes HAWF2043 Twin Window Fan fan is an awful because its highest speed is so pathetic - it hardly blows. It was not cheap either - $55
5,excellent product,"It's effective, and easy to fit into most windows.Pretty quiet - I had no problem sleeping with the fan in the window over my head.It's almost as good as an AC for those nights when the air outside is nice and cool but the air in the house (especially under the roof) is hot and stuffy - basically most summer nights in MI."
2,Just ok,"Fan does its job but the one I received has a wobble or something on one side so that there's a repetitive rattle. I'm not sure if it's the fan blades or something with the motor on that side. Annoying. Rather than fool around repackaging the fan for return, I'll use it in an area where I'm not sitting.I also wish that I had chosen a different model with a simple on/off knob or switch. I remove the fan from the window when I go to bed and it takes 11 pushes on the settings button to cycle through all the combinations to get to off."
3,OK,"I overall like the fan, the design and style is really what I wanted. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because if you're in a a room that is super hot, This fan is not going to do anything for you. I really needed a air conditioning unit. Now I know so next year for this particular room I will get one."
4,annoying controls,"EDIT- score increased following comments to my original post.You can shut down the fan by holding the button, instead of cycling through all the settings. This makes the fan much more usable.A single button controls all the speeds and temperature settings. It takes a total of 12 presses from turning on at setting 1 to turn it off again!If you plan to install this and leave it on all the its it may not be a problem. I have this in a workshop window, and want to turn it off when the workshop is not occupied. Pressing that button repeatedly is wearing very thin on my nerves...Two switches are provided for the fan direction, you could have one fan venting and the other drawing in air. The two fans would begin to counter act each other though.The airflow is not that powerful, more of a gentle breeze."
4,Great Fan!!!,"I've had this fan for a few years and just purchased a second one. I've never had any problems with the fan. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars because the extender is a little hard to use.I love that you can have one fan blowing air out and one bringing air in. Also, you can either set the fan to keep the room at a specific temperature or have the fan on continuous air flow."
2,My other window fan pushes more air,"When I first started using the fan, I found it frustrating to shut off as I had to press the single control button many times - but I soon learned that holding in that one button would shut it off without pressing it a dozen times as it cycled through the options. But more importantly, I found that this fan doesn't push as much air as an older window fan i own, so I'm disappointed in its airflow, probably putting less than half the air out, though maybe it uses less power?"
2,Worked great for the first 72 hours..,"This fan seems great. Worked great...for about 72 hours. I switched the right fan from intake to exhaust and now the right fan wobbles and makes a bunch of noise. No matter which direction it's set to now.It works. And has some seemingly cool features. But the temp settings really don't work. At least not at helping to maintain a certain temp. they do turn the fans on and off, randomly. But setting the fan to 70 is not going to get you to 70 degrees in your room.. it's more like a dial setting allowing you to go from low to high.The fan works, but is really loud now.the main features that they make this fan more expensive don't work."
3,fan,"Wish the fan was more powerful, using it as an exhaust window fan during some dusty work didn't do the job I needed. But I couldn't find another fad that would fit my window."
2,Not Strong Enough to Beat the Heat,"We purchased this item, even though we thought it was expensive for a fan, thinking the thermostat feature was well worth it. However, it never succeeded in exhausting the heat from the room, no matter which temperature we set it at. The fans are just not strong enough."
3,quiet....but low airflow,I ordered this Twin Window Fan because I wanted to replace my noisy Honeywell Twin Window Fan with it.The Holmes is very quiet compared to the Honeywell....however the airflow- even on high- is only about half of the capacity of my Honeywell Fan.I use the Fan to exhaust air from the kitchen and the Honeywell works..... uh... very well. I'm keeping the Holmes because it will serve in an other room during hot summer days.
3,not as strong as I expected,"I was hoping this would be a stop-gap help for our kitchen until we're able to get an exhaust pipe punched through the roof and a proper exhaust hood installed. It's not that strong. If you're right next to it, you can tell it's moving air out but it doesn't reach the smoke five feet away to move it out."
5,Meeting my expectations,This fan is quiet enough. I am using it in the window over my kitchen sink and it's great. Love that I can do both intake and exhaust at the same time and that you can set the temp as well.
2,One Touch thermostat not efficient,"If you don't use the thermostat settings, you must click on the ""one touch"" button a dozen times to turn it off. The one I received had a problem with the low setting clattering, so I couldn't leave it on at night in the bedroom, so I had to return it. When I tried to leave the therm setting on, it would turn on about once a minute for about 2 seconds -- just enough to wake me up. This was not satisfactory for my bedroom setting, as I'm a very light sleeper. I will say the construction was good and sturdy, though. I ended up buying a Lasko from my local ACE Hardware story and although it does everything I need it to, it is very flimsy and cheaply made."
4,Another expansive eclectic work by the Furries,"At first this album came as a let-down, as few songs seemed to grab me. I guess all I was after was the pop sound of Northern Lites, the fast guitars of Do Or Die and The Teacher, and the aching balladry of Fire in my Heart. But repeated listens reveal some good stuff. The Door To This House Remains Open and Some Things Come From Nothing do indeed show a hint of their roots in techno (they always said they weren't keen on Britpop, although lazy hacks around the world lumped them in with it), which makes for something unique and fresh, and the use of unusual often exotic instrumentation ensures that as UK guitar music falls into a rut, SFAs will be spared. Check out their latest release, Mwng, which is entirely sung in Welsh, for something even more experimental."
4,"Hey, it works for me !","I was looking for something ""different"" without going to a salon. I just got over a drying perm from October. I have fine, but not thin color treated,blonde hair. Was a bit scared of the size of this thing, but....oooh...how shiny...had to buy it. Well, everyone loves my hair!! My husband says I look 5 yrs younger, hey ""Are you leaving the house looking that good?"" You know....It gives me loose perm like waves,last til the next day. Take a little styling spray to the underneath & wow !!! If your top has layers like mine, ya might have to develop a knack for that. Mine's great ! I luv luv luv it !!!!"
1,JUNK,"I am a Professional platform artist. I have been trying out various irons so that I may promote the tools that work to my clientele, from all around the United States, which of them was the smart buy. Plain and simple this iron does not work. Stay far away!"
2,"Fascinating premise, but a let-down.","While well-written and intruiging, Behn leaves you with the idea that this is just too far-fetched to be plausible. The proof just doesn't add up, and it becomes apparent in short order. The author nearly admits it in the first chapter! There are better Lindbergh books out there. This would make a good historical fiction version"
1,Does not fit 2004 Acura TL,"Listed as a correct kit for the rear brakes of 2004 Acura TL. The four clips that support that brake pads on the bracket are too big. The center portion of these clips that slip into the bracket are too wide and would be pretty deformed if you pushed hard enough to get them on. Not wanting to risk having to take them apart again if it developed a noise or problem, I ended up reusing the old ones. The other two anti rattle clips that go into the caliper fit just fine."
5,BEST KIDS BOOK!!,I loved this book when i was 4! My mom would read it for me every night!It was great!My mom thinks that too!Now i am 10 and i still love the book!If u want a great book for your kid buy this one!! I bet your kid will love it!!!IT IS THE BEST!!!I think u should buy it!! by Melanie
1,"Get something else, unless you really mean it!","I have, fortunately, only the first of the CDs packaged here, but it is perfectly awful. I'm sure that Cortot was a fine pianist, but this recording is older than the hills, and the static is, if anything, magnified. Unless you happen to want this particular recording desperately, you ought to check out something else, such asChopin: Études, which I like very much. If you are just looking for Chopin's Etudes, that will serve you much better."
4,Very Interesting,"This means a lot coming from me because generally speaking I do not like short stories. This was thoroughly entertaining, well written, innovative, interesting. I would recommend it to others without reservation. I really enjoyed it."
5,Best series ever,"best thing since Monty Python, hard to believe this is Canadian comedy, love the series and this box set, the box is cool but the flip lid easily comes off"
4,Very useful,Although written 30 years ago the survey is still interesting. As an eng. myself I hoped to find more structural inputs
3,"Interesting, but not practical","This DVD contains some interesting ideas for the large scale commericial grower, however a home grower would find most of the details unnecessary or difficult to impliment. If you live in a medical state you should probably work for someone else with the skills needed before attempting this anyways. However, it was an entertaining watch."
1,Should work for a few days,"I bought this grinder and it worked for a month before the motor burned out. It would grind the beans very coarse no matter what setting it was on. Had to grind two or three times to get fine enough grounds. Then the motor burned out. I e-mailed the place listed for problems in the owner's manuel. The response was that I had probably used it wrong. Let's see, put in beans, set grinder setting, push button. Hmmmmm."
1,I had a negative experience with this product,"I purchased this product because it was on sale. (just the color white was on sale) Overall, the reviews I read were positive. My experience was not. It stopped working the first time I tried it. Yes, I read the directions before I used it. At first everything seemed fine and then it suddenly stopped working. I tried unplugging it and letting it sit. I tried all of the settings. I reread the instruction manual to see if I had overlooked something. It just died.Other people have had good experiences with this product. Not me. I will never purchase another product from this brand again. I still need a burr grinder. I will do more research on the products available and not just purchase the one with the best price."
1,broke down in about a month,I think the quality of this product needs some work. The one I bough never worked very well and broke down completely in about a month.
2,The Messiest Grinder on the market,"The industrial designers went wild on this one. It creates a mess all over the counter everytime you use it. The little plastic lid on the top of the container where the ground coffee ends up falls off or in the ground coffee half of the time. It doesn't have a handle or grip on it and the one on the main container for the ground beans is next to useless. Don't the designers of these things ever test or try anything. The ""if it looks good, it is good"" argument doesn't fly with me, and this puppy can't even taxi well."
5,Saw These 3 Live - Can't Wait to Hear the CD,"I happened to catch Dirk, Tim, and John at the Prism in Charlottesville, Virginia last night as they toured to support this album. Their performance was fantastic. They played a number of the songs from this album, including the first tracks that are highlighted on this review. I have given the CD an early review - I cannot wait to hear it, but based on last night I am sure that it is fantastic. I also recommend seeing these performers live. It will be well worth it!"
2,Loudest thing ever,"Its advertised as whisper quiet. Well, its not. The instructions say for continuous use choose the high setting. When it is on high it is extremely loud, like a good size table fan on high, at least. There is no way I could sleep with this thing in my room. The low setting is not as bad but still quite loud. For the price it cleans the air well, but describing it as whisper quiet is fraud."
5,heart health,"I used to test my old scale by getting on and off it a number of times .. it was always off by pounds each time ... I was always doing the three out of five times test to get the ""accurate"" number (in my favor of course!)This scale is wonderful. It is either totally accurate...OR... totally consistent! (either way works). I'm using it for weight control. But if you have heart problems and need to know what's going on in your body this is definitely way beyond your regular scale, the directions are extremely clear and VERY easy... If I can do it, you can, and feel safe."
5,Great scale.,We have had this for several years and it is still working. It is accurate with a lot of features like BMI.
3,"Acceptable, but not great","This tap wrench works as advertised holding smaller 6-40 taps, as well as up to 1/4""-20. I returned a similar product, an Irwin Tools 21201, which did *not* hold the smaller taps securely.The problem with all of these tools is the knurled chuck, which is difficult to tighten properly without another tool. Because of this design flaw, I cannot give this any more than three stars. You can tighten the chuck using your hand, but there will always be some play after you do so. To properly tighten this, you will have to use some sort of wrench or pliers."
3,Did someone mention the errors yet?,"It's kind of a drag, especially for a book of this type, that there are so many errors in both the text AND in the provided source code. Some of the code has clearly never been tested as published, since it actually doesn't run. Uninitialized variables, incorrect derivation of (calculus) derivatives, function names used as variables within the same function (causes infinite recursion crash on some systems), etc., etc., etc. All of these errors that I found in a single chapter have not been published in the book's extensive errata, so presumably have not been found yet. If something doesn't check out in this book, don't blame yourself, check another reference to verify the correct calculation method."
4,"This is not a review, is a petition",I want to see the table of contents of this book. If it is possible e-mail it to me .Thanks ....
3,Holiday Yule,"AS put, there is no original for sale as of yet. However the white cover boast original it isn't so. Its the outside of the fire place burning. The GREEN and RED ""Holiday Yule"" Is the inside of the fire place. There both good but neither DVDS are the original because there are no originals for sale as yet. As per my research. Cudos to the Holiday Yule though. I highly suggest you check with the other interviews first before purchasing."
2,WAY OVER PRICED,"The log is cool and all. The songs are good. But if you go for one that doesn't have the ""orginal"" tag you will pay about 1/4 of the price.I would def say shop around before you purchase this one for $20. Its quite the holiday ripe-off. But as you know, everything is more expensive around Xmas"
3,Pretty good stuff.,"I've had Sacred Groove in my collection for several years. Until just recently, I hadn't listened to it for a long time. It's a pretty good album from George Lynch. It contains ten tracks: four instrumentals and six vocal songs. Sacred Groove has a cool and full-sounding production and is in a hard rock direction. The songwriting is pretty good, and the musicianship is very good. George Lynch doesn't disappoint at all when it comes to the guitar work. There are different vocalists utilized throughout the album. My favorite tracks are ""Love Power from the Mama Head,"" ""I Will Remember,"" and ""Tierra Del Fuego."" All three of these tracks are instrumentals that George Lynch does a great job with. ""Tierra Del Fuego"" is an interesting instrumental that has a Latin flavor. Sacred Groove is a solid and satisfying disc. It's worth a listen."
4,Disregard the Guy Who Says Awful Vocals,"This reviewer who says the vocals are awful is ignorant and out of his mind. Anyone who doesn't know who Glenn Hughes and Ray Gillen are probably shouldn't be reviewing albums in the first place. Worse yet, anyone who doesn't like their vocals has absolutely no taste at all. Some white guy trying to sound black? Yeah that white guy happens to be Glenn Hughes formerly of Deep Purple and Black Sabbath. Recently, Glenn has revitalized hard rock in the past few years with awesome albums like Building the Machine and ROCK. Ray Gillen also sang lead vocal in Black Sabbath and led Badlands before his untimely death."
1,The truth is out there,This book is perfect for those easily fooled into thinking these complex works of art are the work of a couple of english dunces with planks of wood. Anyone who has delved into this subject knows that most(there are most likely some hoaxes)of these circles could not possibly be the work of humans as we know them.The amazing complexity of the circles denies this conclusion.It's obvious the 'reviewers' here are hopelessly locked in the dark ages just as those who refused to believe in the round earth theory or the solar centric theory 500 years ago.Instead of this horrible propaganda for the 'hoax' agenda which those here have obviously swallowed like sheep I highly recommend William Gazeckis well researched dvd Crop Circles Quest For Truth an intelligent and scientific(yes scientific!)doco on this most intriquing of modern day mysteries.
3,Fabulous! Until...,"This dryer was great when I first bought it. It's easy to use, dries evenly, and my hair is soft, straight, and beautiful. I have very thick, curly, coarse hair but this dryer worked just fine. I'm dyslexic with a round brush and dryer, so having both in one appliance is great.Note: I've noticed that some people have had issues keeping the brush attached to the dryer. The key is to keep turning the brush until you hear a loud CLICK and it's snugly inside the barrel. Otherwise, it's apt to fly off while you're doing your hair and burn your hand. Not fun!Over time, the brush bristles have started to collapse into the barrel, which makes the whole process a pain. I've had it since June and it's now October, so I guess that's okay for the 15 or so bucks I paid for it."
2,Great while it lasted -TWICE,"Two stars is being very generous actually. I bought the first one even after I read the reviews- I turned it on and ""POP"" w/ a stark and it was dead! I never even used it. I returned it for a new one- which worked GREAT for about 3 months- I turned it on one day and NOTHING- I do not believe I will go for #3... I have had other hot brushes last MUCH longer than this one- The ION dryer is nice, but not worth the hassle!"
4,ultimate analysis of smith & rainey,"I definitely agree with ""mpgrier"" who writes that Davis' book is almost flawless in its discussion of Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey. If Davis had chosen to write about these two artists only, the book would have been an instant classic and a triumphant tribute to the artistic and social impact of these remarkable women on American culture.The fact that all the lyrics are included is all the more reason to recommend this book. Being a white man from Norway, I may not be the best judge of language and style in the transcriptions of these lyrics, but they remain a powerful read, and they become an even stronger listening experience."
1,No Service,Not recommended! I need an accessory and Bionaire (the factory) won't supply it. I have called them three times and they don't have it in stock an will not tell me if they will ever have it.
3,Issue resolved?,"I purchased this fan despite all the reviews that pointed out the thermostat issue. Apparently they have addressed the problem because my thermostat works fine. It's not as good as AC but it works as advertised. Regarding the reviewer that had problems with the fan sucking bugs into his house due to the rather large vents, you don't have to mount the fan in the window channel. You can easily mount it in front of the channel and just have the window hold the back edge of the unit. This way you can leave the screen in place and not have to worry about bugs. All in all it it's a solid unit. Maybe a bit overpriced but it works."
3,Bad Warranty service..,"I purchased the item half yrs ago, and it has just been sitting on my window. After a while, I haven't touched it, I couldn't turn it on anymore, and it would just turn on and off right away. So I called bionaire for warranty service, and was told it would take a month for the warranty claim, because they have to inspect the unit and check the paperwork to see if it is still under warranty etc.. But the best part is that Bionaire charge customer a S&H; fee to ship the unit back to customer!!""Why are there S&H; charges for returns?The Warranty does not cover shipping or handling costs, only the cost of repair or replacement""What kind company charge customer S&H; for warranty claim, if you warranty your product for five years then if it is broken, they should fix it and return to you FREE OF CHARGE, and not customer have to pay for S&H; both way..All I can say is,the fan does its job , but the company service is not so good."
4,Good for kitchen,"I was looking for a kitchen exhaust fan and it fits very well. It has 3 different level of speed and 3 ways of use (in, out, and exchange). The only catch is that it doesn't fit my window perfect, but it doesn't affect its use. Overall, it worths the money, way better than those $20 box fans!"
2,Digital Thermostat will not work,"This fan is a nice quiet fan and fits pretty well into a standard window. However, the digital thermostat DOES NOT WORK and I have replaced the fan three times now. I am going to get a refund and find another model. It is very frustrating because the fan itself is nice, you just can't count on the digital thermostat. Mine reads 90 degrees and higher and it's not even 75 degrees out. I do not recommend this fan!"
1,False advertising,"The description specifically states that the fan fits windows up to 37"". It does not. You must PURCHASE an additional $6 item to make it extend to 37"" windows, and you can only do that IF the company happens to have the extenders in stock that month. Otherwise you're left with a useless product. This is textbook bait & switch, and people should not patronize Bionaire."
5,5 minute fix,"Love this fan! Seriously it took five minutes from box to perfect sizing in my hard to fit window to programming to air movement in my room! Love it! I've had it for a couple of months and it has made a BIG difference in my electric bill also! Love the quality for the price and love the design! Also, my kid makes fun of me for using the remote as often as I do but it's just fun!!!"
4,Great little fan,"Good airflow capacity. Multiple flow levels and direction allows greater seasonal use . Temp control works great ,especially on those cool down nights. The fan on full hi is a bit loud at night . I typically turn down on low which provides plenty of airflow and very quite"
5,Love the Remote,"The fan is very functional. I love the remote, to turn on and off and set other things, it comes in handy especially when you do not want to get out of bed. The thermostate is a good function because sometimes at night it gets too cold and the fan will turn on and off by itself. I highly recommend the fan for anyone!"
1,Bad Thermostat,"Just like the other reviewers said, the thermostat on this does not work. My showed 98 degrees in a 74 degree room. The fan is controlled by this thermostat. There is a reason Amazon has these on clearance. My is being shipped back as I write this."
5,Excellent Book !! Real examples of Flash MX 2004 Pro,"This book is a really good investment for everybody who wants to go deep into Flash MX 2004 Pro. Nate included real examples, with really good information. You need some good coffe at nigths to follow each exercise but at the end the investment time is worthly. 3 kind of applications for 3 kind of servers... amazing example of a really good book, ( If you find some bugs Nate give you quicky answer.... Just be carefull with the Access database configuration )."
3,Only gave it a 3 Star cause I love Conway,"As a hugh fan of this Legend Country singer I give it a 3 Star But, I was rather shocked on how awful this movie was made. Even after I read previous reviews I went with my fut feeling and was wrong. The thing that disappointed me was Conway never even sang a COMPLETE song besides maybe 2 of them. Overall I will say I still somewhat enjoyed the DVD and will add it to my collection of movies. George Jones by far as the best concert DVD's. So I wouldnt really recommend this DVD unless your like me and just really like Conway."
2,Something is missing here,"I have loved the music of Conway Twitty and especially to see him perform, but I cannot get over how unappealing this Greatest Hits Live DVD came across. Done by his family, I get the sneaky suspicion it was staged to appear live.Everything is close up, you don't see an audience, unless a clip of an audience was slipped in toward the end. The music is ok, but lacks that live feeling. It is simply song after song, after song; no feeling of connecting with his audience, and certainly no feeling of performing live.Apparently it may have been done with a videocamera, and it sure looks it. I'm sure the family wants to put out some concert performance of Conway, either for memories or money, but this is done poorly, too distracting to attempt to enjoy Conway. .....Rizzo"
4,Conway DVD,"I bought this for ""It's only make believe"" I thought it was going to be on there 2x's but it split in 2 parts and not all of is there - so sad:( Other than that Conway was always spectacular!"
3,It only plays one on TV,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said if you don't expect a TV miracle then this is a nice little device. I found it particularly good for those little crevices that are hard to get to. It was great for around the bathroom faucets and stove knobs, but you STILL HAVE TO SCRUB but it seems to loosen the dirt and it makes it easier so in that sense it's worth it. I also like that you don't have to smell the noxious fumes of some cleaners and this is all natural. Also it does heat up really fast. This is the best TV gadget type product I've bought in awhile."
1,STEAM,"I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT MY REVIEW OR NOT.I RECIEVED MY STEAM BOTTLE FROM HSN, YESTERDAY.IT SAYS WAIT 2 SECONDS TO PULL THE TRIGGER.WHAT A JOKE. WHEN YOU PULL THE TRIGGER, YOU HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE, TO GET MORE STEAM.THE BOTTLE GETS TOO HOT TO HOLD, I HAD TO WRAP A SOCK AROUND IT. THE FINAL STRAW WAS I GOT A BLAST OF STEAM, I THINK FROM A ESCAPE HOLE. I HAD IT JUST ABOVE A SINK, I DROPPED IT IN ONE SECOND, BUT I STILL BURNED THE PALM OF MY HAND.IT'S OK, I AM SURE THE PAIN WILL GO AWAY IN A FEW DAYS.BEFORE GOD, I SWEAR THIS IS TRUE.SINCERELY YOURS,ROBERT CURTOFT. LAUDERDALE, FL."
2,I got what I paid for.,"Clarity and sharpness of the pictures are not that great. Yet, if you think about the price of this lens, it's not really that bad. The material used feels and looks like a toy. If you really want a good wide angle lens, I recommend Canon 10-22mm or if you want something cheaper, a Sigma 10-20mm will give you the best result."
3,Cute and emo,This happily lived up to my expectations of what I wanted from this book. Cute and slightly emo in classic Tobias style.
5,One of--if not--my most favorite in the series!,"I loved this book. It was exceptional. I thought it was funny and exciting, and had everything an Animorph book should. Tobias is one of my favorite characters, and Rachel IS my favorite. Both of these characters were in it a lot, and that was another plus. I loved the chapters when they told their families what they are and what they could do. Rachel's mom reacted so stupidly it was funny. My eyes were glued to the pages without exception for the two and half hours it took me to read it. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. A must-have addition to the Animorphs series!"
2,"Poor Quality, good customer service.","I bought this router table at a tool show, it included a powerful router. The sales people said that this was a special show special, well, it wasn't, it was the same deal in the wood magazines. Strike One!I got the table home and tried to assemble it, the sides seat in a routed dado, they did not fit the dados were too short. Strike Two!Even if I got the thing assembled, the router plate was leveled by wood screws under the plate that were at all different angles to the plate. Strike Three!Good news! They took the unit back the next day, at the show. I would do business with Woodline again, I just would not purchase the router table.FWIW"
1,Fails to meet expectations,"Objectivity, or a shot at it, is, admittedly, not something one should always expect to find in a historical work, especially if it is aimed at a broad audience. But if a book is opinionated, it should at least be an fun read. O'Neil's volume fails on both counts - it is blatantly subjective and painfully boring, in addition to being rambly. The author includes a lot of detail where a brief summary would surfice, and brushes over important issues, leaving a reader with pages of generalities. The chapter on minority discrimination, for exapmle, is perfunctory, and shot through with anachronic assumptions, providing little insight into the issue beyond the (selective) listing of facts. The technicalities of descriptions of military operations will quickly put you to sleep. Frustrating reading!"
4,An Insightful Book by an Insightful Man,"I had to read this book for my course on twentieth-century American history (which was taught by the author). I will admit that the book reads like one of his lectures, where it is up to the reader to discern his main points. However, O'Neill does try to touch base with the various aspects of the war effort, from the men in the trenches to the millions at home who took up factory jobs to keep America moving. That in itself is a daunting task, and O'Neill does it quite well. This book is a must for anyone who is interested in World War II!"
5,The best straightener I've ever used.,"This product is by far the best of anything I've ever tried -- it takes me now 10 minutes to dry and style my hair, instead of more than an hour with other hair dryers/straightening irons. The straightening attachment actually blows hot air through its plates while you straighten, so it's drying it at the same time -- that seems to be the magic trick that makes this product so effective. It's incredibly simple to switch the attachments. And, as an added bonus, it's easy to pack for those who travel frequently.In short: highly recommended, and at this price, it's a bargain. You will be amazed!"
1,Don't waste your time,Please I'm telling you don't waste your time on a book that dosent help you with anything just read the manual that it comes with and you will know just as much.
5,Reverse Heart Disease NOW,"Excellent reading for all whether you have heart problems or not. I refer many co-workers to this book. Many may not have the same background to understand it completely, but will guide them to alternate and natural solutions to their disability. Preventative medicine is the key here and it's never too late to start your health habits on a better path. In many cases people only associate pain with a problem and are ignorant of the inner problem till it is too late."
4,Become informed about use of natural health and perscriptions,This is the second time I bought this book. I gave the first one away to help a friend with congestive heart failure. I love a book where a Dr. is humble enough to learn from his patients and start including naturalhealth in treatment with awesome results. Great patient examples. Easy reading.
5,Very informative,"I bought this book because my blood pressure readings came back elevated a few times. I wanted to know what to do to lower it naturally.My ex husband also used the recommendations in this book and lowered his blood pressure naturally, so much so that his doctor asked him for his secret."
1,Don't Buy This!,"This electric razor was refurbished... thought it was new.... defective trimmer out of the box... terrible and irritating shave. I returned this item for credit. Good seller, but a bad product."
1,Trivial Footage of Narcissists,"I hated this. Because :- The footage is for the most part boring and trivial.- The subjects have so little to say. They are for the most part narcissists in love with the sounds of their own voices. They blather on, endlessly stringing big words together and working out endless rationales for their own importance.I swear, the majority of this footage is these immature characters - Angela Davis is the worst - just blathering on, saying ""Look at me Mommy and daddy, I'm an EDUCATED negro! I can use big words and I'm SMART!"". Don't believe me? Watch for yourself. I guess in that sense there's documentary value to this, but it's boring as heck."
1,Not very interesting,I must agree with many of the other reviews. I could not finish this book either. It certainly showed its age and was very far fetched. His later work is much better. I guess we all have off days.
5,After the realities of 911 this book will shake you up,"While the book was written years before 911, it hits home with this brand of terrorism. The reader on the audio tapes was very good and held my interest throughout. Some of the technology things are dated now, but even so you'll enjoy it."
3,Not as thrilling as other Patterson novels,Maybe I just prefer the Alex Cross novels but I found this book a little hard to get into at first. Definitely not as good as previous reads by Patterson.
2,Black Friday,"I did finish the book. I actually skimmed through the last half. There were many grammar errors which totally surprised me. I like many of Patterson's book. None of them deserve 5 stars, many deserve 4 stars. This one just barely made 2 stars. Really happy that this was a library book. I would have been upset if I had spent money on it."
2,Kinda sketchy,"First of all, some pages, in the Child of Moon....Moon in Pisces or whatever combo section, are missing. I couldn't reference one of my relatives - Child of Mercury....Mercury in Pisces. Then I found some of the celebrity/historical figures for each 'Child of' hilarious. Oh yeah, I have much in common with Venus children Rita Hayworth and Pol Pot. Guess that explains my flair for dancing and genocidal tendencies. Whew! And all this time I thought it was just me. The good part is the artwork. It's a pretty book if a little vapid."
2,Ruling Planets,"First of all, the review about missing pages is correct. Sadly there does seem to be pages missing and that seriously flaws any book obviously. The author should offer either a refund or replacement for putting out a book with missing pages. It's the least they could do.Further, I have read that your ruling planet of your chart is the sign, and it's planet, of the first house. Maybe astrologers differ in what planet actually runs the show. Knowing something about the planets of all signs is important but there is one that is suppose to rule the chart itself. Unfortunately this looks to be more for entertainment or the coffee table than anything you could really learn something from."
4,Your Never Covered,"The skillet cooks great. All you have to do is preheat properly for good results.But, a lid/cover would be a nice option."
5,Quality Product,Wifey who is long time good cook of 55+ years said the Cuisinart Multiclad Pro Stainless is the best cookware she has ever owned.
3,its ok,"I bought this as a trial thing. The pan isn't bad. It's well made, but I have treated it several times and still sticks every time. If your cooking with oil its just fine."
3,Not Horrible...,"Pro's: It's a stainless tempered MM ruler.Cons:The packaging is horrible. It was all I could do not to bend the ruler trying to dislodge it from it's packaging.The slide is WAY TOO loose. It's nearly ""fall off"" loose. Wouldn't be so bad to tighten it down so it won't fall off, but the slide also has a ton of ""side-to-side"" play almost guaranteeing that you will never be able to use it effectively. When you try to ""set it"" it just ends up at an angle... wow. Worthless.Very flimsy - very thin.Weird ""substance"" on the rule. Nothing a good cleaning wont take care of, but seriously, I have to clean a ruler out of the package?I'm sure I can fix it up in the shop to make it worthwhile to have.. but be warned, you will need to do a little work on this to make it usable."
3,Made of Gold,"I needed replacements for my air cleaner. No big deal, right? Well it shouldn't have been, but wait till you check the prices for your Holmes air filter replacements. The operating expense of this unit for a year almost equals the initial amount paid for the whole unit. This complaint aside the two pack I got from Amazon is the best pricing I could find. My three star rating is more directed at the idea that Holmes has you over a barrel than the service I received from Amazon which I would have given a five star to."
3,"Works well, but at a cost!","I use these filters with my HAP242 air purifier. These filters do work as you can see them turning gray and collecting dust as the weeks go by. The only drawback is that these filters are pricey compared to other filters with other brands. Other than that, these filters do work well.I would recommend ditching these filters and going for a more cost effective air purifier that uses more affordable filters, such as the Hamilton Beach brands. The filters I order for my Hamilton Beach purifier is under $15 and work just as well as these."
3,Too expensive!,"We use the Holmes aircleaner to minimize allergens and to clean the air when my husband lights up a cigar. These filters work well, but they are very expensive and generally last less than 2 months. If I could do it again, I'd buy one of those air cleaners that don't need separate filters -- just a rinse. After all, I'm already paying for the water."
3,good straightener,"does what its supposed to do. one bad thing is on both of the longer edges of the gold plate, the hair gets caught on it. (meaning the edges are not smoothed off...which makes it very frustrating to use sometimes)."
1,breakable,"This vacuum cleans well, but is made of a lot of cheap plastic parts that just break all of the time. It is really hard, if not impossible to find replacement parts. It seems that by the time you replace all of the broken parts, plus the filter you have almost bought the vacuum new. If I could replace some of the breakable pieces such as that little plastic peice that holds the vacuum upright, or the cleaning hose, then I would reccomend it, because it is a powerful vacuum. But because it is so hard to find parts for and because the parts seem to break easily I will never buy dirt devil products again."
1,One of the most pathetic vacum cleaners on the market,We bought this Dirt Devil about a month ago and have had nothing but problems. First it was issues with the base seperating from top then later performance. It became clear that it did a better job if you shut it off and picked up the dirt by hand. If it was possible to give negative stars I would have. Finally I am happy to say we put it on the curb for trash and cut the cord so no one else would suffer the same fate by trying to take it to their home. Switched to a Bissell and never went back.
1,Do not buy,It worked fine the first time...second time NO SUCTION. Glad I was able to get my money back. Don't waste your time with this item...vacuum lemon.
1,"My ""dead"" vacuum cleaner worked just as good!","I totally agree this cleaner is a waste of money. It spits the dirt back out and does NOT suck it up. You think you're done until you shut it off and then you find the pile of dirt! I absolutely HATE this thing! I might as well use a broom!! I have no idea how anyone could rate this anything other than negative, negative! Unless they are confused about what vacuum they are rating... I just bought this a month ago.. and will probably end up buying a different one. I too get tired of taking it apart every time I want to clean. Def not a fan of Dirt Devil, for sure!"
3,I'll Meet You at the Cucumbers,"We are a group of fourth graders who just finished reading I'll Meet You at the Cucumbers. We all liked it but it could have better. The author could have been more descriptive, and the book could have been lounger. If you like fantasy, we are sure you will like this book. It's about three mice that go into the city for adventures. They are Adam, Amanda, and Junius. Adam is afraid of the city. Will he go for Amanda's birthday or will he stay behind in the country? You will have to read to find out!"
2,Purchased 2 - Only 1 works,"I purchased two of these as gifts for my sons. One set up quickly and works great a month later. However, the other one will not read a disc; any disc; even the rescue disc sent to us by Magnavox. They are very helpful at Magnavox, but am disappointed to know that we have to pay shipping to the repair center. Also, I ""thought"" I read that we could purchase an extended warranty on these. That is not the case. Magnavox will not sell extended warranties on refurbished items. Also, if you send them for repair, they do not give you another 90 days to see if the recorder works okay; you only get the original 90 days, so if it doesn't work this first and only time, we will be out of luck. However, I should have connected the recorder prior to gift time to be sure they both worked properly."
4,Quality Product,"This is just what it looks like and almost everything you want from a drinking bubbler. The chrome finish is perfect and the product seems very durable. So far, no leaks -- a big plus.I have only one minor gripe and that is about the adjustability of the water flow. It can be adjusted up or down but not down far enough to give that perfect arc of water you expect from a drinking bubbler. This makes for a jolly good time when unsuspecting users blast water on their face. :) It's possible that our water pressure is too strong for the fixture.I would still recommend the product."
2,Completely underwhelmed,"Don't judge a book by its cover, nor a DVD. I love the old In-Fisherman guys as much as the next guy, but all this dvd was good for was a walk down memory lane. The footage was all over 20 years old and the sport has evolved so much since then. The info provided is good for a first timer, but lacks any of the technological advances of the sport."
2,BEWARE - Not A Good Tutorial,"I was reading these reviews less than 2 months ago preparing for a graduate school class in which Pro-E was used, I never used Pro-E before (just AutoCAD). I ignored the one bad rating on this tutorial and bought it. What a mistake!!! This book will only give you headaches. The topics are very specific, it starts with a given part and makes some specific changes (which may be good for advanced work, NOT for a beginner). NO sections on just basic operations like sketches or making basic lines/curves. Many examples skip steps and you have to guess your way through. No explanations of core functions, like constrains (a function not familar to an AutoCAD user). LOOK FOR ANOTHER TUTORIAL!!

4,The Rough Guide to South India Map (Rough Guide Country/Region Map),It is useful for travel to India.
2,Archaic First Course in Numerical Analysis,A constant in numerical analysis for years the second edition has not kept pace with the way mathematics is contemporarily taught to engineers and scientists. The book appears to assume an older format of learning mathematics was used by the reader. The reader will soon be seeking additional texts to make this one understandable.
5,A Great DVD set!,This show was just as funny in the first season as it is now! A must have for Scrubs fans!
4,"Funny, Pleasant way for relaxation",I work in a very busy dental office and things get crazy and hectic there. What I loved about scrubs is it reminds you of sittuations you have experienced before and how you would have liked to handled them but didn't dare.I would watch these DVD's at bedtime and every night I would crack up and fall asleep with a smile on my face.I shared these with my boss and he enjoyed them too.
5,"Get on it, NBC!!","This is one of the most original, well-written, entertaining shows that has ever graced the tube! It's very funny, but it's also insightful, thoughtful, and sometimes bittersweet; I was desperately looking for the DVD after Season One and could not believe that it wasn't out there, especially considering some of the rejects that are on DVD right now. Hey, Peacock People, you made the mother of all mistakes by losing Letterman; don't make another colossal boo-boo by moving this show around and/or temporarily replacing it this season like you've been doing. AND...PLEASE, get all of the existing shows on DVD soon!"
4,Very good first season...,Excellent first season. Being able to re-live how the characters got where they are now is great. I can't wait for Season 2.
4,Scrubs,"I bought these to send to my son in Iraq....he only watched one episode in the US and got hooked, so he asked for me to start sending him all the seasons...."
5,Awesome!,"I Loooove scrubs! best TV show ever! It's very funny and has a message at the end of every episode, just the perfect combination! (perfect medicine if you feel sad!)"
5,Come Swing with Bean,"Well, it seems Mr. Hodges covered all the bases in his review of this set, so there is little, if anything, to add. The music is excellent, the remastering superb (I have a John Lee Hooker box by JSP that covers 1948-1952, which doesn't sound as good as Kendall's outstanding job on these much earlier recordings) and the players Hawkins accompanies or who accompany him are all top notch. I will add that there is a 2 disc setBody and Soul: The Complete Victor Recordings 1939-1956 Master Tapeswhich is a perfect follow-up to this set."
5,Digital SLR Type Camera Package,After a careful review of Consumer Reports it confirmed my decision to buy this camera. The camara and its value-added package has exceeded my expectations.
4,AMAZING,"This package has everything and a kitchen sink. Its such an incredible deal! The only problem is, it water powered, and I dropped it in the supply and fried all the circuits. But since i saved 66% on the first, I went and bought a second one and just used the first as a super cool paper weight. Needless to say I am the coolest gu in the office."
4,Than wear a jacket.,"I liked this newest effort from NJ's own The Early November. Their music is good for anytime. Whenever I'm having a hard time at work, I throw this album in and it makes me feel all warm and gooey inside(overshare). I also just like listening to it whenever. In fact I only have one complaint. The last Song...didn't really like it. Didn't seem to flow as well as the others did and felt out or place. Other than that, a great album. Any fan of music will like this album."
3,Good,"Again, another product that it seems I can only get online now. So it takes longer to get and not the most cost effective but necessary."
3,Not the best,"This book is more helpful for people dealing with family issues when trying to plan long-term care. It was not very helpful for me as I had gained similar information already from other books that also including practical information about planning long-term care. It really is just a list of questions with a brief intro to each topic. Given the inexpensive price, I do not regret buying it, but I only got one or two ideas from it."
2,"A ""Practical Guide"" without the ""practical""","To much theory and not enough application. At the end of the book I was still looking for the ""practical guide"" part. If you want to learn to build a CCD camera this book is for you. If you want to learn how to use one with a telescope, don't waste your money on this book."
5,Pipe,"What can I say: It's the best 4 foot x 2"" threaded metal pipe ever made in the history of pipe making."
1,GREAT DRINK COASTER OR FRISBIE,"I""M A VIETNAM VETERAN ERA(1965-1966), I TRIED TO WATCH THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE, BUT I MUST SAY THAT THIS SORT OF TRIPEIS MR MOORE'S SLANTED AND BIGOTED VIEW OF THE PRESIDENT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROPAGADA FILM COULD BE VIEWED AS ANYTHING ELSE.........."
1,Scandalous,"Michael Moore should join the Army and go to jump school, like i did. Then perhaps he could talk junk about the Army. He makes it look like the Army is 100% black. At the hospital all the guys missing limbs are white. Any Army trooper who was not disgruntled was made to look like a fool who deserved to die. My old lady made me check this flick out, now its time for FahrenHYPE 9-11."
1,Moore insulted Iraqis,"This movie could be funny to anyone who doesn't really care about the truth. If ""Farenheit..."" was just an hysteric, left-wing parano comedy, it could be Ok.But the picture Moore gives from Iraq under Saddam Hussein's regime is completly scandalizing.More than 2 millions Iraqis died because of Saddam Hussein and Moore summarized their sufferings by showing smiling people walking in the streets...Disgusting revisionism."
1,Documentary?,"Democrats would serve themselves well to NOT associate with this movie. If you want to create a case against Bush, you don't want it to be based on deceptions and lies. While the movie does a good job making Bush look bad, almost all footage of him is taken COMPLETELY out of context. The footage is then manipulated in ways that totally change its original meaning. There's no way I could start on specifics here, but the following link is a good summary of the many deciets in Fahrenheit 9/11. Everyone reading this should check this link out before taking the movie at face value. Because what you're getting at face value isn't the truth."
1,Outright lies.,"The lies and far-fetched subject of his new movie is just a micro-cosm of what this man really feels. Instead of making a documentary with at least some fact behind it, Mr. Moore has made what is essentially a ""Hate Bush"" Movie and filled it with lies. Look, I'm all for free-speech and every thing, but at least have some respect for the President. I doubt Moore would be able to spend one day in the White House. And if your going to blast Bush - Back it up with fact."
1,You be the judge.,"I bought this out of curiosity. It just proves that only in America can any slob make millions out of badmouthing someone else and not get sued. This guy went into great details to show his ignorance. I truly feel ONE star was an overstated rating, but Amazon's lowest."
5,"Forget politics, its a great film!","Politics aside, this is a great film. Moore has really hit his stride with this one. The movie has a good pace and swings you back and forth between laughter and sadness, anger and anguish. Who cannot empathize with the mother who lost her son in Iraq? Who cannot laugh at the quick clips of administration blunders? This film is well done.As an informed citizen, I was surprised that there was so much in this film that was ""news"" to me. And angered. This film really provokes thought and dialogue; what more could you want from a documentary?Way to go, Michael Moore!"
1,Do not believe a word,I went to see this looking for some truthful information but all I got was one man rambling on about his own opinion. Nothing in the film supports what he was saying. Before I was unsure who to vote for and I know Moore's goal was to brainwash everyone with his bs to vote for Kerry or anyone but Bush but since I watched this I am afraid to side with Mr. Moore. Not worth a penny unless you like seeing a man overly consumed with hatred rambling on about nothing.
1,"The Most Biased, Self Serving Video You Can Buy","Moore proves he's a liar and a dangerous one at that. There are an unbelievable number of mistruths, half-truths and bold-faced lies in this mislabeled ""documentary"". It is amazing anyone can believe it. If you were a fool enough to view this garbage, at least do yourself a favor and view ""FarenHYPE 9/11"" for an explanation of the whole truth of what really happened and how Moore lied to us. I am ashamed for Moore in that he has marketed this film as a documentary and that so many people seem to have been fooled into believing it. ""Peter Pan"" is closer to the truth than Moore is."
1,Great Fiction Movie!!!,"President Bush and the Bin Laden family have ties? That's all? Where was Moore's footage of President Bush and Bin Laden playing spades and sharing a plate of spaghetti as E.T. lands in the background and begins conversing with Shrek? That would have made the movie 5 stars. It still had a number of special effects, but not enough to warrant 2 stars."
1,This is pathetic,"If you really want to open your eyes, make sure you also watch FahrenHYPE 911 too, hear what the exploited vet from Michaels film has to say about his unauthorized use of his image and situation, hear what the police have to say about Moore and how he twists words.. Those who blindly follow Moore need to be prayed for."
1,propaganda with anti-American agenda,"A study of propaganda techniques on the level of all fanatic idealolgies of the dangerous. It's a film to watch only to know your enemies tactics and only if followed immediately in the same sitting by FarenHYPE 911 to learn the ""REST OF THE STORY"". I double dog dare those that believe this film has any truth to it to watch FarenHYPE 911 to learn the meaning of those cut and paste film segments when put in context rather than taken out of."
4,Who's right?,"OK, maybe Moore's ideas and concepts are a bit fanatical. But he also shows that there a lot of things very wrong with the US and the little president. I fail to understand why nobody realises that this petty war is bringing the Great Fall for the US. The country has so much potential, but the US along with Higher-Than-God President is just flushing it down the john. Everybody thinks being patriotic means being loyal to a nation and fighting for it. But what about being loyal to Humanity? Is it really logical to fight massacre our own kind or any kind for that matter? Isaac Asimov in his Foundation classic said ""Violence is the last resource of the incompetent."" I agree totally. one shouldn't take this movie to seriously but one should really think about the president ones voting for next time."
5,Extra features worth the DVD,"I had the privilage of meeting with Michael Moore in Syracuse, NY. He showed some of the additions on the DVD including numerous interviews with Iraqis before the illegal invasion, also were scenes from the infamous torture prison where Donald Rumsfeld ordered innocent Iraqis tortured. There is a whole lot on this DVD that wasn't shown in the theatres which makes it a worthwhile purchase even if you have already seen the movie on the big screen."
1,Thanks for tearing apart the morale of our military,"...with lies. by the way, Camp David is not vacation. I've been there, and it's a place for business, introspection, and forethought. President Bush uses it as such, and any attempt to claim otherwise is just plain b.s. I noticed it made your ""80% of Bush's first year stat."" Well done fat boy, for someone who prides himself on honesty..."
5,A Must See for Every Thinking American,"See it for yourself and you be the judge. This movie is jam packed with actual footage of Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell, and Ashcroft spinning, lying, spreading fear, and did I mention lying, lying, lying and more lying? Detractors would like to have you believe that this movie is all just an unfair slanted view against the Bush administration by Michael Moore, BUT the actual footage of the people in the Bush administration TELLING the lies and caught on tape, says it all! Wake up America, stop the blind denial and get informed before it is too late."
1,Left Wing Dreck,"This movie is, to me representative of two things...the amazing freedom that we have as Americans to levy criticism and angst; no matter how distorted, at our government's top leaders, and an abomination of filmaking, not wholly dissimilar to propaganda films make by the Nazis during WW II. It's your money people..it's better used to line you parakeet cage than to spend on this trash. Unfortunately -10 stars was not an option.."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"I am a Democrat, and I thought I would enjoy this movie, but it is lacking in one department: The TRUTH department. Moore loves to tell half the story to get you to side with his opinions, but it's important to realize that you are being manipulated.You could make a Moore-style documentary on Hitler. Begin by saying that Hitler was an art collector, and show some video of his collection. Next cut to the 1936 Olympics where he is cheered by thousands of Germans, and say that he was loved by his people. Finally end with some statistics showing that the German economy recovered dramatically during Hitler's rule. Conclusion: Hitler was a great guy?!?This is exactly what Moore is doing in this film, giving you a slanted one-sided view of the world to further his liberal agenda. This propaganda ""documentary"" belongs in the trash, right next to Triumph of the Will."
1,A big bore,"I don't understand all the hoopla and praise. When I went to see this film I thought Moore was going to open our eyes to some NEW and revealing information in regards to 9/11. But alas, all Moore showed us was rehashed information that has been going around on the internet since 9/12/01. Anyone who saw this movie and was surprised,apparently, you don't get out much. So, after boring me with old news...suddenly, the movie switches gears and becomes an anti-war film with the same rhetoric I heard during the Vietnam anti-war movement of the 1960s. Alas, once again, Moore teaches me nothing new about war, recruiting tactics of the military, or just about anything else in general, etc. Except how long he can hold his camera on the face of a crying mother. Ok, Moore, we get the point. You can stop manipulating us now. Oh, by the way, this film needed to be 40 minutes shorter, too <yawn>. Next time, teach me something!!!!!."
2,Both Arguments,"I believe you should always be open to listen to arguments from both sides of an issue to help you make your own personal decisions. Anyone who watches this movie should follow it up by watching FahrenHype 9/11 to hear the other side and see the liberties taken by an obviously biased Michael Moore who's purpose for making the movie is to discredit Bush, not just find the truth wherever it may lead."
3,"worst doc ever, but pretty good movie","as moore himself said on the daily show, he takes only the points he needs to prove his point, while all else falls on the cutting room floor. it would be interesting to double check all his stats, watch every interview from beginning to end, just to see how he cut it. not to say there arent good points made in this movie, but its a conspiracy theory none the less, and a cheap and childish slandering of our president. if the case was as clear cut as this movie presents it, i have a hard time believing that bush would not have been a) impeached by now and b) that a democrat controlled congress would give the go-ahead for war. im not trying to say this movie is nothing but lies, but to accept this as gospel is dangerous. this is not an account of straight events without intent, this is not a documentary."
3,Worth Watching,"I would strongly recommend watching this movie along with one of the several responses to it (I suggest Fahrenhype 9/11, since it is a very direct response which is well done). It is difficult to disentangle truth from fiction in this movie, but it is worth approaching it in a balanced manner, since Michael Moore is anything but balanced in his approach. This movie is NOT a documentary; Moore has no interest whatsoever in approaching his subject manner from a neutral standpoint. It is purely propoganda, but as far as that goes, it is entertaining propoganda. Just don't automatically take what Moore says at face value."
4,The film itself is very good,"I thought this was a very good film. It gets people thinking and talking, which is exactly its point.The problem I have with the DVD are those little Moore-isms. As others wrote, who is Michael trying to kid? His reputation is fairly well known, especially after TV Nation. But the nonsense in there about this film receiving an R rating? Bowling for Columbine was R, but Moore wasn't outraged at that (probably because he got an Oscar for that one). If he really wants his film to hit a younger audience, then he should offer an alternate version of this film. They made a school PG version of SuperSize Me, so why not this film? Michael needs to drop some of his old tactics and let the films speak for themselves, because this one certainly does."
1,None of it is true,"This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not one to believe everything I see, so I researched most of the ""facts"" in the movie, and I haven't found anything true. Michael Moore takes pieces of interviews and pieces them together to make this fake story. Don't waste your money on this movie. Even the story line is boring."
4,Let Freedom Ring,"In this country, we're supposed to be able to voice our own opinions freely, without fear of reprisal. But it seems that freedom of speech is a hotly contested controversy, along with liberty and justice for all. What a country.The movie was very good, but it did not surprise me at all. I feel that people who keep their eyes open and pay attention, and know how to weed out the media propaganda that we are all exposed to each and every day on television, newspaper and magazine media, etc., would see or have seen for themselves.I decided after Bush was ""selected"" that I would never vote again. Now that his term is up, I have again become an active voter, and hope to conttribute to a change in my country (yes, MY COUNTRY) this election year!"
1,Covers about 1% of the infomation available,"Anyone actually interested in the truth of 9-11 should avoid this movie.It claims to expose all the secrets, yet it leaves out things that even mainstream media reported on.For instance:Why did NORAD stand down?and the fact that Bin Laden was a CIA Asset. And that the Bin Laden family have known the bushes for more than 25 years.For the real information on 9-11 check out any documentaries by Alex Jones - who has completely blown the subject apart."
