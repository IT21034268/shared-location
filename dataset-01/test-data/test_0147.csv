4,Good but not to my expectation,"I placed order for this item, wishing it would be better than my previous 2.1 creative speaker system. It is good but I don't think it is better than my previous one while the price is higher. Although the woofer is great in shape, the sound stick is plain without blue light. I would give it 4 star and only recommend it if the price gets 20% lower."
4,Perfect for my PC!,"I just got these today and I am very satisfied. I do agree that the mid range sound could be better, but lets not compare these to a $20k system. They sound pretty good overall and are worth the price."
3,could be better,Great sound! Just not the performance I expected from HK. The volume control is a little hard to use and don't expect to blast them. I am still happy with the purchace.
4,"Great, if you dig the looks.","I'm a big fan of these speakers. Setup is just plugging the satellites into the sub, plugging the input into your headphone jack (or using the RCA adapter if it's RCA), then powering on the system. They fill a bedroom easily and the bass is good without being overwhelming. I'm not a huge fan of the look of the satellites. I would've preferred if the mounts were a little more stylish instead of just being rubber donuts. It does help transmit the sound better and keeps the speakers in place, though. Overall a good buy for the money."
2,WARNING! good but they sometimes don't last!,"I bought my sound sticks from a recommendation from the folk at Mac about 6 years ago. They were great, the sound and bass are very good. There should have been an on and off switch though, maybe these were added to the newer models.However I just moved and after I plugged them in again they suddenly don't work. Yes I was careful with them on moving but they sound like they have blown. I called Harman Kardman and was told that that's about their average life, I was shocked. Now I have speakers that I just have the throw out, I won't buy any Harman Kardman product again."
3,"Good sound, sharp looking... build quality could be better.","I've had these for about two years now and they have worked well. Sound quality is excellent and they look pretty cool.Recently however, the magnets have started to fall off the backs of the tweeters. I pulled the speakers apart to check it out and found that the magnets are glued in place, and the glue had started to disintegrate. I also noticed that the connections to 2 out of the 4 tweeters had come apart, and the crimp connectors on all of the speakers were very loose. Makes me wonder how many tweeters have been operable. In addition, the extension to the vent at the bottom of the speaker had broken apart. It is a little plastic tube that clips on to the speaker case, and the plastic there also seems to have disintegrated.My speakers have rarely moved, and I don't even really use them often or at high volume. I'm puzzled by why they have fallen apart so badly."
5,Perfectly satisfied,Bought this in 2007 for my daughter's room. I'd seen a set like them at a friend's house and was impressed with the compact footprint and the sound quality. I still am. My daughter's off to college now and I use the speakers. Great to plug in on the back porch and connect my phone or portable cd player. Big sound for a little setup. I couldn't be more satisfied with the quality and durability.
4,Great plug-and-play product,"I love products that are truly and literally plug-and-play - no software to install, no messy diagrams, just a simple plug into the back of the computer and the power outlet and you're good to go.The sound quality on these speakers is amazing, but as other reviewers have noted, best utilized in a small office or similarly enclosed space. If you're relying on these to be a big-room solution, you're overshooting their capability and undershooting your budget! I keep the subwoofer under my desk (by my feet - it's an open area) and the two speakers about 3 feet apart on my desk, and the triangulation of sound is really good. Also, given how boring most computer peripherals and office equipment are, the cool gadget-y look is a nice break on my desktop.For the money and the performance that Harmon Kardon is legendary for providing, this is a great product."
5,P.O.S. Is simply Amazing,"Ha ha ha, there was absolutely no hesitation giving this the good ol' five star rating. I would give it more if possible. This CD is just flawless showcasing POS' original style and flow. This CD literally changed my life, thats how powerful the words and songs are. I saw POS in concert in Phoenix and it was the best performance I have seen in a long long time. Like the first review said, the man comes out as if he is just a stage manager or something. He brings out the old boombox and messes around on the mic. Then all of a sudden as he is talking he begins to rap and the beats kick in. POS has created a totally new and diffrent style and you cannot go wrong by buying this CD. There is no way you can hear it and not like it NO WAY. So I gurantee happy listening. All tracks are great, but the best ones for me are 1,2,4,10,15. HAVE FUN AND BUY THIS. Support the underdogs out there. This one is a hidden gem."
2,"Reasonable, however ...","I've been using this machine at my work Gym for the last 2 months on a regular basis. I love the workout programs and the way the machine feels. However just this week I broke the machine!! It turns out that the flywheel attachment bolt has sheared due to metal fatigue. I am not particularly stressing the machine and at 240lbs shouldn't be causing this kind of damage to professional gym equipment (the maximum user weight is 350lbs according to their specs). The machine is used lightly by the staff at my company (maybe 1.5 hours use a day at best). Maybe we had a particularly weak machine or lower quality machine where the welds weren't done properly. Other than this issue, it's a nice machine to use. Very comfortable.Anyway, if you're a professional gym outfit, be wary. Make sure you get a warranty!"
4,Very Different! Probably better suited for adults.,"The art is wonderful, I guessed it was a story suited to my daughters age (4). The book looks really beautiful! It is a large book with fancy writing and cute bunny-like characters. After reading it to my daughter, who quickly pushed it away, I wasn't sure which of us was more confused!! I wanted to know what this book was about! I read the inside flap, and then my friend and I spent a considerable amount of time re-reading and talking out what it meant, line by line. To us, it was actually about distractions in our lives, not appreciating the good times if there were no bad times, frienships, alone time, meditation, truth, etc.. It's a great adult conversation piece. However, the words probably are NOT meaningful for ages BELOW 13, and the cute art probably is not attractive for ages ABOVE 8 (excluding adults!)"
2,Just bad.,"I'm sorry but i found this to be perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not only were the camera shots fuzzy and sound muffled, the plot of the story was TERRIBLE! It made absolutley no sense to me to follow this movie's trail. I just kept waiting, no WANTING IT TO END! Just bad."
3,lousy pictures,"The art in this coloring book is boring. What makes coloring fun is the detail--even for the youngest ""artists"", simple lines in complete pictures make for better coloring. These pages are not filled--usually there is a central image of Harry, Ron or Hermione or two or three of them--no details of place or action and lots of empty white space around them. Even the glitter glue doesn't make up for this boring collection of coloring pages. Still it is Harry Potter and a true fan will still find some pleasure in it. Also Neville makes a rare appearance."
3,Well Built But Birds Not Crazy About It,"We have six bird feeders in our yard of various types. This feeder is by far the least popular with the birds in my yard. I believe this is because it is more difficult for them to pull the black oil sunflower seeds through the screen than it is the other types. I have two other types of black oil sunflower feeders and the birds prefer them to this feeder. On the plus side, the unit is well built, pretty easy to clean, and should last a long time. Also, since it holds a lot of seed and the birds don't go through the seed very quickly, I only have to fill it up every couple months. As an aside, I also have the thistle version of this feeder which has a finer mesh screen, and it is one of the most popular feeders in my yard."
1,Shipping took almost 3 weeks!,"It was the book I need, but the seller took 3 weeks to ship!!! i had to buy another one locally because I needed it for class."
5,problem resolved quickly,I had ordered the book and c.d. the Greatest based on the song by Kenny Rogers. Well the book arrived but NO C.D. so I quickly contacted the seller and he said he did not know why the disc was missing but he no longer had any and he credite my Amazon account
3,This book is good buy but I want more from it....,"I have learned a lot about JNDI through this book. But the problem I see is that there was no coverage about JNDI and Microsoft Active Directory. In fact I was able to learn about JNDI through this book but then had to surf the web on how to use JNDI with Active Directory. Had the authors included a large section on Active Directory with JNDI I would have given this book 5 stars.The CD that comes with the book is wonderful. Even though you can download all the material on the CD it was nice having MySQL, Ant, Apache Tomcat and other material on the CD. For now this is probebly the best book on J2EE 1.4 but I learn from examples and this book could have included a lot more examples. Again, if the book had more examples I would have given the book 5 stars."
1,General is right!,"I have to say that this book was very big, fairly expensive and NOT HELPFUL. I got a 60 on the Humanities exam, but not ONE question on the actual CLEP exam was in this book. I would suggest saving your money & going to the library to look at art books, listen to classical music, read literature and rely more on your stock knowledge of the fine arts. Had I not had a good background, I would have surely not passed. Not worth the study time."
4,no title,"This director also did ""Rocky"" and ""The Karate Kid"". A small, enjoyable film about a real-life bronco bull rider named Lane Frost who became a world champion in his early 20s. Cynthia Geary, who plays his wife, sure looks like she is Jessica Lange's daughter. The resemblance is remarkable. And the intense scenes of bull riding. Why on earth would any man want to do that for a living? The film really showed the bone-jarring that goes on, and the very real danger once a man is off. Lane Frost was killed before he had a chance to live. Somehow, just to be the best at bronco bull riding, while providing entertainment for the crowds, does not seem a worthy endeavor to lose your life over. The actor who played Lane's dad, James Rebhorn, has been around awhile, and is very good. In fact, he later starred in the wonderful ""Babe"". But Geary is not so very good. She has all of Jessica Lange's woodenness without the intensity inside. The music was good, country, and so was Stephen Baldwin."
1,8 seconds movie,I have a tracking report that it arrived at the post office but they never seen it therefore I have not received the movie.
5,Amazing,"Though biography movies do have a tendency to show an amount of sensationalism to make a story more interesting in this case, there is no need though I am sure there is a bit. Lane Frost shows honesty in his failures in the choices he makes and how those choices as well as the right ones helped shape his amazing life. The marriage in its up and downs and the raw emotion expressed was actually my favorite part."
5,COWBOY UP!!!!!!!,I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST!!! I CRY EVERYTIME I WATCH IT.. I AM A COWGIRL MYSELF AND I KNOW IF I LOST MY HUSBAND IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ME TO GO TO A RODEO AGAIN.. AND I BARREL RACE JUST LIKE KELLY.. ANYWAY THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD..I TRY TO WATCH IT EVER SUNDAY!! ITS THE BEST!!
4,Good introduction to Depersonalization.,"This book has a lot of useful information. It also had a few chapters that I feel could have been left out. Particularity the sections about DP in philosophy, and the arts. I also feel there should be more practical self-help information than there is.Overall, if you, or someone you know, suffers from DP, this is a good introduction."
5,Fascinating!,"An enlightening book on a subject that has needed Illumination. This book covers the many forms and facets of DPD as well as the many ways it has been described, defined and managed. It covers therapies and medicines that have helped and those that have not. The case studies are fascinating and show just how varied this disorder manifests itself. It is so well written that it seemed every question and skeptic querie that came to mind regarding the cases were anticipated by the authors and answered by the end of the chapers. An easy read on a tough subject!"
2,`Revue' NOT Review,"2137 words?The actual word count, INCLUDING FOOTNOTES, is under 2000. Without footnotes the word count does NOT exceed 1400 words. Half of these words are interpolated song lyrics for the stab at the dark at a `revue'.Where has all the creativity gone?Three Stars! But one goes to Tracy Chapman.End result = 2 stars."
3,Still reading,I am still reading this book but it has some good advice and exercises to do to help you and to discover yourself. I have heard it works and helps so that is why I got this book.
5,Pal to NTSC,"I had seen mixed reviews of this product and was looking for a simple PAL to NTSC conversion soultion for tapes from England (family). I purchased this from Amazon and have been very happy. I am using a Sony HDTV to view, I have been more than happy with the quality of the conversion. It is very simple to use and I have used its nice frame to frame view to look at some NTSC videos. For the price its looks like the best option."
2,Answer to Jason/Sam theme song (on General Hospital),"Jason and Sam's theme song is titled: ""Just You and Me"" by Rie Sinclair. You can hear it here: http://www.purevolume.com/riesinclair"
1,One Star is Too Many,"This is not a novel so much as it is a litany of complaints against a specific facility. It is hard to determine whether the author is speaking of experiences she claims to have had or is attempting to write a fictional story. As another reviewer posted, it does not appear that this book was proofed or edited. The grammatical errors, misspellings, and abuse of the english language make it very difficult to continue reading. If you can get past all of the errors and poorly constructed sentences, the ""story"" and ""characters"" make it difficult to continue reading. This book consists of bizarre ramblings, unsubstantiated claims (unless the claims are intended to be fictional parts of the story?), and fantasy. If you've ever encountered anyone with a sour grapes attitude about a former workplace, you should be able to see this book for what it is.I am very sorry I wasted my money and I hope that you do not waste yours."
4,Reader's reviews of Polish history are rarely unbiased,"Davies sympathized with Poland as a nation wrongly accused of not doing enough during WW II to help save its Jews from the Nazis. His opinions conflicted with Jewish academics', with whom he quarreled. Those differences in opinion are worth noting by any serious student of Polish history and should not, in any case, be used as an excuse to criticize everything Davies has written. An earlier reader/review characterizes the expression that peasants ""live lustily"" as a ""fairly typical Slavophilic view."" Obviously he\she is not Slavic, and the comment and its context is certainly negative. Makes me wonder what people's view the reader represents?"
4,Criminally Overlooked Cd!!,"At this point in their career, QMS were kinda stuck in second gear. The last 2 Lp's had done ok but not enough to warrant any big push from Crapitol, I mean Capitol Records. But Duncan, Valenti, et al responded by making this record. Jazzy , Folky and rocking all at the same time,for me this is the best QMS album. A big plus is that Bill Inglot did the remastering. QMS albums always suffered from crappy sound quality, but this remastered disc sounds great!!! I highly recommend this along with the next one (Comin' Thru)..........."
1,"Try it, but you won't like it.","I couldn't even get though the entire movie. After enduring the poor direction and script of this film for thirty minutes, I fast forwarded to the end to view the inevitable ending. What can I say, I am a sucker for romance and I love Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara. (Parent Trap) Even the ending was disappointing. It just goes to show that fine actors are not all that is needed to produce a quality film;. However, one mans junk can be another man's treasure; so my advise for you is that you try it and see for yourself. I am pretty sure, though, that you will agree with me when I say this one is really poor."
3,Peckinpah's apprenticeship film is fascinating for fans,There are many flaws in Peckinpah's first feature (a low budget Western) but it is fascinating for fans of this director. So many of his fingerprints are here:- Peckinpah's unsympathetic handling of the lead female character. He always struggled to portray women in anything but one dimension. Peckinpah's sympathies definitely lie with he-man male played by Brian Keith who is brilliant.- A slimy companion (Chill Wills) who is the prototype for so many other slimy sidekicks in Peckinpah films.- Those telling little Peckinpah details.The music in the film is mostly terrible and the script banal but Peckinpah striking direction makes it interesting as he builds the film to a surprisingly satisfying conclusion.As other have stated it is simply criminal that this film is presented on in Full-Frame.
1,DON'T LET YOUR CREDIT CARD GET CAUGHT IN THAT AWFUL TRANSFER,"In the good old days, you could recognize a great movie without being smothered by any cult or comment by a ""specialist"".That first Peckinpah picture was really great. The kind of simple western in the Boetticher tradition.Along with some Gordon Douglas and Harry Keller pictures, it was he only kind that could have saved the western.You can't recognize anything here: an 1,33 version of an early Panavision photography, sporting a transfer who would have shamedthe worst cheap VHS cassette."
3,Okay,"This was a pretty good movie, nothing really to write home about. I purchased it for the Tim Curry movie collection"
4,Inside look at a circumscribed world of British journalism,"Set during the time of the Faulkland (Malvinas) Island war, our protagonist is an opportunistic journalist played with the appropriate cynicism-- by Jonathan Pryce--whose demeanor seems set with an expression that synthesizes concern, irony, jadedness, and disgust. He maneuvers among the intellectual set of Britian--insinuating himself into the right circles to enhance is career as he bursts out in laughter at a friend's poetry reading, shows utter disdain toward a group of 'peaceniks"" and impatiently checks his watch at his mother's funeral since he has more important things to attend to. A rather interesting portrait of intellectual hypocrisy and double-dealings among those whom many intellectuals admire because they do not see beneath the veneer of concern and the search for truth that hides the motivation that is at the heart self-promotion for many in the literati set."
1,Just listen to the sound clips.,"The most obviously inferior clips are ""Before He Cheats"" and ""Inside Your Heaven,"" in which the tribute artists don't even attempt to hit Carrie's notes. If Carrie records an unplugged CD, I'll definitely purchase it, but why would I listen to *her* songs performed by vocalists who make singing sound strenuous?"
2,Not the best collection title-wise...,"As a major fan of MST3K, I was very disappointed to see what tiitles were included in Volume 11. Ring of Terror was the best of the group, which really isn't saying too much. The Indestructible Man is mediocre, Tormented is depressing and boring and Horrors Of Spider Island wasn't that memorable either. The extras are the best things about this release. My question is why don't they release the Finnish productions (Day The Earth Froze, Magic Voyage Of Sinbad, Sword & The Dragon and Jack Frost.)? These episodes are hilarious, and I can't believe the rights could be that difficult to get. I realize all DVD releases of MST3K depend on rights, but they could've chosen better titles for this release."
5,Best to Pre-Order while you can...,"If history has taught us anything it is this, you can't depend on the new MST3K sets to be available for long, so if you're interested it's best to get them while you can. Case in point, Mystery Science Theater 3000 volume 10... available for purchase for about three months and then it was suddenly pulled from the shelves in a quiet recall with no replacements ever sent out. I myself had to get Volume 10 off of eBay (at a hefty premium at that) because I waited too long thinking it was a buy I could put off for a little bit. How wrong I was. The moral of the story is, when Volume 11 comes out, (as well as volumes 12, 13, 14 and so on), it's better to hedge your bets and get it as fast as possible before they vanish all too soon.Oh, and my reason for giving Volume 11 here a 5-Star rating sight unseen... that's just me being the loyal Mistie fan-boy that I am. =^)"
2,Returned it.,"Worked great for one movie, started skipping during the second one. Not really badly...but bad enough (about 10 times). Took it back and got a higher rated player. It does have a cool zoom feature not found on other cheap players, but that doesn't make up for the skipping."
2,Blood pressure raiser!,"This item was a gift from my children. We were excited about our future home movie watching. Big disappointment! As this was our first home DVD we first thought all the jumps, skips and freezes were because of dust or other on rented DVDs. Not so. Whenever we play a DVD it always takes at least 1/3 longer than the mond where we were frozen out. Not to mention all the heart stoppages when it stops for a second or two in the action."
2,O what a disappointment,"Had I never read the book, I am sure I would have enjoyed this movie. But the truth is the movie does nothing but show some nice quiet people being nice and quiet. Yes, I say nice. I felt no desperation, violence, love, extremes of the heart that should have been portrayed constantly. I felt very let down. The masters did not display much domination, physically or psychologically. O seemed bored, not attentive or aggressive enough for one who is bound. Two stars for the pretty people. I'd call it a very nice horse movie, National Velvet anyone?"
3,A CLASSIC THAT SEEMS TAME BY TODAYS STANDARDS,"I saw this movie when it first came out and was captivated by it. At the time it was fascinating, intriguing and shocking. I recently bought it to share with a friend of mine and was somewhat disappointed. Time and events have dated this film and it is no longer as exciting or interesting in light of the erotic films that have been made over the past few years. For those who want to view a classic and a period piece, this is still of interest. However, this film needs to be remade and updated to reflect a more modern perspective."
1,I wish I had not seen it,"I wish I had not seen it.The movie captures the book perfectly. Very, very cleverly and smoothly done to seduce you into thinking this sickness is erotic. A woman hypnotically narrates some of the philosophical claptrap from the book. The film seduces the viewer with music and beautiful photography to ""buy into"" the very arousing scenes. After you have seen it there is a bad kickback due to the impersonal cruelty of the men and the self-humiliation of the women.I wish I had not read the book; I wish I had not seen the movie."
1,"Excerpts of the ""Story of O""","This ""Region 2"" version is extremely edited, to point of destroying the story's continuity. It is a shame that this was done to this classic."
4,Slow tempo jazz from a master trombonist,"Some jazz critics have noted that many of the selections on this CD suffer from having the same tempos. There are compensations for this, however. The first and most important is the presence of Mr. Johnson who shows his mastery of his instrument in every selection. There is fine support from the rest of his quintet. Stimulating listening all the way. This CD is in tribute to J.J.'s deceased wife (hence its title) and a most worthy tribute it is. 4 1/2 stars."
2,Oops,"Wonderful material for the price, but whoever sewed it together chose to sew black with WHITE thread.Used four bobbins of black resewing everything. The gromets had to go because they were open and sharp.Spent three hours remaking this item and now it almost looks good enough to wear anywhere."
1,This book is not useful,I've read this book to learn about mysql.But I couldn't get any valuable information from it.This book has very poor examples and it doesn't mention how to program with jdbc and c/c++.You'd better read the mysql reference manual.Don't buy these book.
2,Disappointed....,"I had to learn SQL quickly, given ~ 1 weeks time.The book makes many references to using MySQL (cause its free), yet 1/2 of the examples and exercises do not work on MySQL, due to syntax issues between MySQL and the other, ""favored"" DB's used in the examples.Also, it makes the assumption that you've installed MySQL and have it up-and-running, and yet I lost ~10hours fighting with logon credebtials once my MySQL was loaded on my Lunux box...what a hassle!I guess if you use Oracle or SQL 2000...you'd have an easier time of it....."
4,Whew!,"Bruce Hornsby doesn't have much of a voice, but he plays piano like a rocking Keith Jarrett, writes songs that tell stories, and really knows how to put a crack studio band together. With musical guests such as Pat Metheny, Jerry Garcia (his very last recording session, I believe), Bela Fleck, and Chaka Khan supplementing his crack studio band (special kudos to Jimmy Haslip on bass and John Molo--a real dynamo!--on drums), Hornsby has produced a CD that really cooks from start to finish, and which is recorded with plenty of gusto. Whew!"
5,Bruce knows music.,"Excellent from start to finish with the opening, high-charged ""Spider Fingers"" leading the way, Hot House seems to be a very underrated album. No two songs seem anything alike and some great ones are to be found here. ""Changes"", ""The Tango King"", and the in-your-face ""Big Rumble"" are pure gold. There's also ""Country Doctor"" and my favorite of the bunch, ""Swing Street"". The only weakness may lie in ""White-Wheeled Limousine"" but even it is not a bad song. Bruce never disappoints and this one is no exception."
1,Song of Solomon is...,"... pretty terrible. I had to read this book for a class in high school. It has the appearance of being deep and meaningful, but in reality, Toni Morrison just throws a bunch of symbols together and calls it a book."
1,A total distortion of the novel,"I can't believe that an artist like Toni Morrison would allow the book to be slashed and altered with this abridgment. The result of this Reader's Digest style alteration is a work that bears no relation to the novel. If you want to misunderstand the novel, use this recording. You'd be better off in Sparknotes than in listening to this. What a waste."
5,Song of Solomon,"Knowing nothing of Song of Solomon and having only heard good things about Toni Morrison, I find myself immediately intrigued by the opening pages--namely, an invitation, by a note tacked on the door of his little yellow house, to watch an insurance agent fly from Mercy (hospital) on his own wings. The reader is briefly introduced to the rest of those who respond to the invitation and catch only a hint that their stories may be interwoven.The reader is led to trust the narrative voice Morrison uses and slowly accepts the mystical landscape and glorious elements that are so important and sometimes unbelievable if it weren't for the narrator's reliability. From the first lines, with a circularstorytelling mastery, Morrison weaves symbols and images to create the backdrop for the story of the Dead family and compels one to turn the page."
3,Not Quite There,"Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison is a novel that chronicles a man's journey to self-discovery. Morrison's language is folkloric; she retells her characters' stories in ways that make the reader feel a part of their lives. However, while the novel is beautifully written, its theme is one that has been portrayed in many American novels. While Song of Solomon is gripping, it left me expecting more. If you want to read a novel about a black charcter's search for fulfillment, I recommend Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora Neale Hurston, over this novel."
4,Drapes,I was so happy to get the drapes as I am going to make a shower curtain with one and 2 valances with the other...but I have been so busy and haven't had a chance to do it...I bought the bed comforter and was happy to find the drapes..the only thing the fabric on the comforter is a little wrinkly....the drapes are made out of the same fabric but it will be easier to iron them...
2,WARNING NO Linear Stereo Capability,If you have VHS tapes recorded in Stereo on the Linear tracks this VCR will only play them back in Monaural sound. All pre-recorded VHS tapes recorded in HiFi Stereo also contain a Stereo Linear track on the edge of the tape. This unit can not default to the Linear Stereo. It will only play the linear track back in Mono. This unit also does not have an LP Record mode.
2,DOES SHE CARE ABOUT HER SON??,"What a waste of time to read this junk...She glorifies being a druggie, groupie and sleeping with every guy who came around. Did she ever get STDS or AIDS? I sure cant figure why not and what about her son? Sounds like she just gave him up to her mom.. What a cold hearted person she must be. If I were her I would be embarrased to admit some of the stuff. As for making Mick a lover, I was most interested to hear that Keith is actually a caring person unlike the persona he gives off.. (if you can believe any of Mariannes stories here)... She is really a messed up lady trying to make $ off this book. Hope she has the decency to give some to her ""son""?"
4,Latin-English Dictionary,"Good dictionary - but like any well-packed information book that you can carry around, you need a magnifying glass to read it. We got it for our homeschooled (grand)children to help with their Latin glasses and they seem to enjoy and learn from it, translating their sly remarks into a language they think the rest of the world won't understand. Nice trick for parents and grandparents that know what is going on. Better than sneaking into their diaries!"
1,Los Bravos (from Spain),"Hello my name is MArta and I'm from Spain. I live in USA now. Los Bravos the spanish rock band is a different band, Pintalabios it's not by Los Bravos ( a 60's rock-pop band from Spain) I wanted to clear that up. :)"
3,ok early 70's picture,Michael Sarrazin in a fine performance plays a young man who accidently kills a pedestrian with his car. He goes unjustly through the court and prison systems. His attitude is taken into account more than his actions. The radical mood of the movie is typical of its time. Barbara Hershey plays a supporting role as his pretty girlfriend. Ruth White gives a somewhat funny performance as his bigoted grandmother. 2.5 out of 3.
2,Camille Surviver,"I am a suviver of Camille. I was stationed in Biloxi, Miss. when it hit the Gulf Coast. I remember a great deal of the tragidy and hardship the storm brought and the many tornatoes which came from that storm. I have never seen any video which did this storm justice. However, I do realize that the videos and equipment were not available at this time to collect this data. This video is about as good as any for what footage can be found. Much more footage is available for later storms which were not as sever as Camille but did more costly damage due to the massive increase in populations and realistate of later times."
3,Midwestern small town,If you are interested in the history of life in the midwest you'll enjoy this book. Lewis Atherton describes the social history of a midwest town from the 1860's to the 1950's.
5,Great Mailbox at a Great Price,"Fortunately I already had a rock solid 4 x 4 post that my sad old mailbox sat on top of so the toughest part of the process was having to use a handsaw to cut the post down to the required 2' height for the Trimline. Once that was done the Trimline slid down the post with just a bit of effort. (Note: 4 x 4s are really 3-1/2"" x 3-1/2"" -- if your post is any wider than that you may have a problem getting the Trimline to slide down your post.) After that, 4 long screws to keep the box on the top of the column, 2 bolts in the front of the column that went in pretty easily with a socket wrench, 2 thin screws to put the plastic cover on the back, put my address on the box (3 each of numbers 0 thru 9 are included) and I was done. If your post is solid you're going to have one very solid and nice looking mailbox. My only regret is that I didn't do this years ago!"
3,Not quite worth it,"I haven't actually purchased this book, but Amazon won't let me post without giving it a score. However, I just want to point out to any WoW newbies interested in buying it that many things change in Azeroth, meaning this atlas will become more and more incorrect as time passes. Flight paths have changed more than once, as have the locations of various NPCs. Also, dungeons and entire areas have been added to Azeroth since it was released two years ago, including several since this book was published last winter. If you really want up-to-date maps, I would search online for sites that keep updated maps. Usually, sites that offer maps also have maps and walkthroughs of instances, so they will be much more useful than this atlas. Allakazam is one site I can think of off the top of my head. Not to knock this book, I'm sure it's pretty and all that; I just don't think it's that useful for playing the game."
4,Samsung new and improved,"Samsung is an old name in audio, and an up and coming name in video. Among low-priced DVD players, this unit stands out. It is a good value and a great entry point for new home theatre enthusiasts. Unless you have a knock-out system, you won't notice too much difference between this an other models."
2,skippy,"I was very pleased when I purchased this product, price, features, ease of use. After playing a few discs I made a horrible discovery, this thing skips at will. Instead of bringing it in for repairs, I brought it back to the store for a Toshiba model. $20.00 more, but no skips, not one. buyer beware."
5,good CD,The other artists (besides disturbed) I liked and ended up getting some of their CD's so if you like metal and don't know all the bands on this you may want to get it or if you just don't have the majority of these songs already.
3,"Decent, Except for Taproot","i have seen disturbed and chevelle in concert before and knew what to expect. Disturbed sounds just like they do on disk (which is good actually, because they sound good on disk). Chevelle and Unloco are also ok (Unloco broke up. Just thought you needed to know that.) Taproot sucks. No, I mean, that's why the rating is only 3-- because i had to sit through the couple songs they had on here wondering ""Who would ever give these guys a record deal?""Anyway, Dehumanized is a really good song and unreleased. I bought it without the DVD part so I can't tell you about that. Sorry. I am cheap."
4,"Intriguing images, the dark side of Faerie.","I've remembered images from this book for 30 years. The tunnel at the back of her closet. The ""dream come true"" of being able to be as bad, rude and selfish as she wanted to be, and the faeries still flattered and encouraged her in that behavior. Now as a parent I see it as a story that vindicates my eternal efforts to teach, guide and control my daughter's behavior, especially when she wails, ""I need freedom!!! Kids should be allowed to do whatever they WANT!!!!"" I can't WAIT to read it to her!"
5,Finally found after all these years,"Now in late middle age, I can hardly remember many things -- that the title of this book has stuck with me for what must be about 40 years is a testament to its legacy. I haven't read it since reading it twice all those years ago and share many other reviewers' memories of it being strange, disturbing and fantastical. I'll add my chorus to all the others. After years of searching dusty book barns, out-of-print searches, etc. I simply cannot believe you have this book. I can't wait to see if it's as good as I recall."
4,Good quality,These cards are really good for the price. I don't like paper cards because after a while they become soft and bend too much. These plastic cards are perfect they cost a little bit more but they last way longer than paper cards
4,"Excellent quality, look and feel - but needs a better case",These cards feel great and the quality is evident. I like the simple and elegant look to them as well - nothing too flashy.My only gripe is the case (or lack thereof) Some kind of individual case for each deck would have been nice considering the price.
5,great cards,been playing poker for a long time now and i can say that this is one of the top cards you can get.
1,not plastic,"cheap material, not plastic 100%, would not be good for more than 3 games, not recommended at all. bad product"
3,Secrets of Fat-Free Italian Cooking,"Some things ae pretty good. Others taste fairly bland. Concept is good. Not having an upscale market nearby, it is sometimes tough to use cook books that simply put the words ""Fat Free"" in front of every ingredient. Fat free meat, fat free chicken, fat free cheese...some of these recipes would be a lot better with some fat - and upgrade to the the ""low-fat"" version."
2,No more than you'd expect,"I guess I shouldn't have expected more from this book, finding it as I did on the bargain shelf at Chapters. In my defence, I took the fact that there were only a few copies of this book left to be a good sign, instead of considering the other possibilities: a) a sign that many a good chick-lit fan had been duped by the blurb on the back cover; b) the result of a short, and inconsequential press-run.That being said, it's not that bad. There were a couple times while reading this book that I was impressed by a well written metaphor, or some such flash of brilliance on Monroe's part. However, these were greatly outnumbered by the amount of times I had to drop the book to groan in disbelief at another romance novel cliché. All I'm saying is that if you want to write a Harlequin, you should write for Harlequin, and not risk disappointing those of us looking for some decent women's fiction."
5,Titus season 1&2,"Funny, funny, funny. You think your family is strange watch Titus your family won't seem so bad!!!!"
2,It had run its course,"By Season 3, this show had run its course. It almost seemed as though the writers sensed that the show was on the chopping block and tried to cram more melodrama in before they were cancelled. I mean, first the niece was abandoned by her parents, then briefly gay, then bullied by schoolmates and finally confronted with previous sexual abuse by a family friend. That's one mighty unlucky teen. I understand that Christopher Titus had an unusually rough childhood, but this was completely over the top. The writers seemed to pride themselves for being cutting edge, but in the end they relied on the old sitcom staple and focused on a kid to attract a younger audience. It was a clumsy effort."
4,great analysis of theoretical lingusitcs,I believe the author has made great strides in showing many of the pitfalls in teaching languages in the years past (thirty-five to be exact). Dollars and cents is another issue that he brings foward in understanding what it takes to run a good teaching/learning program whether here or across our borders.
2,Stomach pain,It helped the migraine a little but caused severe stomach pain so I would rather just not take it than have to deal with the stomach pains
2,I passed the Exam No thanks to this book,If you are going to take the Linux Plus this book is way out of date and does not cover any of the topics on the exam in much depth. I would not even consider this useful for cramming. The questions were simplistic and designed to instill a false sense of confidence as the questions on the actual exam were much more difficult.
2,NICE BOOK BUT NOT COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH!,Yes like some of these other reviews say this is a nice book but the fact is that this book alone may not be enough to pass the Human Growth & Development CLEP test. Yes there are several other reviews about this CLEP test and this books preparation for it but most of the reviews are over a year old and are outdated. If you have no prior college experience and have never taked a CLEP test before and a lot of people haven't then you need to avoid this book by REA and this CLEP test and first try something easy like CLEP Principles of Marketing which REA also makes a book for. You should not depend on this book and this book alone to pass this CLEP test at least supplement it with something such as the College Board CLEP Guide which is on the shelf in almost any bookstore. Furthermore if you have never taken a CLEP test before avoid Human Growth and Development and take an easier CLEP test instead.
1,Not very good help.,"This book wasn't a really good help for the clep. You cannot even find the answers to their own practice test on the book itself. I would rather buy a textbook which is being used for this course, that really helped me to pass the test."
4,Easy exam to pass,"I have taken 4 CLEP exams till now and this turned out to be the one I needed least preparation in. The exam is not that tough, its mostly about current research and general questions (general viewpoint about cultures, teenagers etc). The book gives u a base to go for the exam and if u guess right and eliminate the wrong answers, You should do fine."
5,LET THE READER BEWARE,"If you consider yourself an amateur history buff as I do, and is fascinated by tyrants such as Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin, this book is one that should interest you.There are many pictures that one will normally not see nowadays. Pictures of happy Germans fawning over their Fuehrer. The writing is stilted and bad. But it is interesting in how different writers were so uniform in their deification of one man. Under normal circumstances this book would not rate one or two stars due to the poor writing style but the importance and significance of this book makes these a good book for one's collection. But only if the reader has an interest in such drivel.If one is to believe Joseph Goebbels, the German people loved their Fuehrer in 1936. But did the German people love their Fuehrer in 1946?"
3,Gary Cooper Hollywood Clasics #55189,"This set has Fighting Caravans, A Farewell to Arms, Meet John Doe and Stolen Jools. Fighting Caravans is a wagon train epic which is fun to watch. A Farewell to Arms is one of THE original Academy Awards nominees, back when these awards were new. Meet John Doe is a Frank Capra classic and should be in everyone's library. Stolen Jools is just a short with alot of then famous actor cameos (even if they are no longer famous now).And hey, for the price, you can't beet this one."
5,"A hard-hitting, honest account which doesn't pull punches or disguise its humanness","Author Tania Katan was 21 when she was diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer: 10 years later and one breast less she again faced the same diagnosis. Don't expect the usual story of pain and courage: Katan's raw, blasting memoir is playful and angry alike, covering everything from self-image and post-mastectomy sex to shopping for a mastectomy bra. My One-Night Stand With Cancer is a hard-hitting, honest account which doesn't pull punches or disguise its humanness."
5,Excellent!,"I really got into this book. I liked the authors writing style..the book flowed very easily. I have since reading it looked the author up on YouTube and heard from her directly about how her life is going now. This book is a funny, heartfelt book that I will recommend to my good friends."
2,Absolutely no impact protection.,"Billed as a sporty case, this product provides no actual impact protection. The very first time I dropped my iPod mini it landed on a lower corner. The impact shattered the iPod screen, chipped the corner, and the neoprene split at that corner. This was from a height of 3 feet (pocket level) onto a tile floor. I don't expect to be able to brutally abuse my equipment, but the plastic inserts for impact protection did absolutely nothing. Upon further examination, they wouldn't do anything unless the iPod landed totally flat, which is not all that likely.The case looks fine, armband works fine, no complaints other than it didn't protect the iPod AT ALL. I only gave it two stars instead of one because there aren't any other issues. I would definitely not get this case again."
3,Never mind the songs...here's Jerry Goldsmith,"Disney has finally seen the light and ditched song-meister Menken, who can pen cute ditties but can't compose a decent score to save his life. Goldsmith (a veteran who has composed some of the greatest film scores over the last 35 years) contributes a sweeping, majestic, and passionate score that makes all other animated Disney scores into mush. He overwhelms the film, making the dippy songs sound even worse. It sounds as if Disney's heart really isn't in the songs. The tale of Mulan is told by Jerry Goldsmith. I'd complain about there only being 32 minutes of Jerry on this album, but most of his soundtrack albums clock in at that length (due to union rules) so I'm just glad we got that much. Five stars for the Goldsmith score, one star for the songs, for the averaged-out rating above."
2,Pop version a BAD idea!,"I don't understand why Disney had to do another version of an already lovely insipirational song. The original song was already perfect with its melodic rhythm and Lea Salonga's clear, lyrical voice, and Disney had to tamper with it by having Christina Aguilera ruin it and turn the song into an-American-Idol-wanne-be-piece! No wonder this pop version didn't perform well in the charts as Disney had hoped it would. Serves Disney right!"
4,"Music wonderful, Songs not quite so","I'm surprised Disney got Jerry Goldsmith (famous for darker work such as THE OMEN or LA CONFIDENTIAL) to score the movie MULAN. He did a wonderful job, bringing out the best parts of oriental music while still making it accessible to Western audiences of any age.The songs are a different matter. None of the songs sung in the movie are memorable; Christina Aguilera's pop version of ""Reflection"" is actually better than the ""original"" one. My favorite song has to be ""True To Your Heart"" by Stevie Wonder and 98*. Funky funky funky!"
4,A Good Lifeline Of Mulan,"Mulan is a very touching cartoon movie. It's very different from the other movies such as Tarzan and Pocahantas.This movie is set in the ancient china.The sountrack,""Reflection""tells me how Mulan feel about herself.She sounds as if she didn't recognise herself.This song really make me cry and wanting to hear it all over again and again! I repeat the songs many times just to understand the lyrics.Even though I didn't get to buy the Vcd of the movie, I still bought the movie soundtrack Cd.Anyway all the songs in that particular movie really makes me cry and fall in love for the first time I heard it. The composer must have a taugh time to think of the songs. If the song that has been compose is not matching with the movie, there's no use of having that song. Just to say, that all the singers have done a good job to make this movie a success!!"
3,STRONG,"MARK LESTER, THE YOUNG STAR OF "" OLIVER "", IN A SPETACULAR THRILLER, WITH TELLY SAVALLAS AND FRANCO NERO."
5,Superb book!,"This book is great for detailed descriptions of Mars' geology. In my opinion, this book is a treasure trove of information for those intrigued by astronomy and geology, especially planetary geology. The book clarifies complex geologic processes unique to the planet Mars. Yet, it still fuels the wonders of the imagination. This is an incredible reference book."
4,A true Legent.,"A Mahler 2nd that fits in a single CD is a rare beast. Mehta clocks it at just over 81 minutes (which make this one of the longest CDs in existance). So he has an edge on price. He also has an edge on performance. This is a great reading, truly electryfying. Vienna Philharmonic was in their best form during these concerts. The beggining of the symphony is fast, but you never get the feeling of hurried playing, just a tremendous drive. The sound quality is OK; had it been better, I would have given it 5 stars!"
2,Shallow Mahler....,There is no where on this record where I hear and feel anything like Klemperer's awe inspired view of this music...instead I think Mehta goes in for Opera effects...the high C at the end on the trumpet is flat and the orchestra is not always together. As for the recording it certainly tells every flaw...even with the roughness of Klemperer's orchestra we have some feeling for the music....!!!
5,12-Inch Round Griddle,"Great buy! I'm glad I read the instruction which said DO NOT use non-stick spray on this pan or other non-stick surface pans as it puts an invisible film on the non-stick surface causing it to no longer work like it's designed to. This pan lives up to it's expectations. Although there are grooves like in the surface my pancakes, eggs etc. didn't stick. It's a nice weight pan and certainly a bargain for the price."
4,Worth the price!,I have bought similar products from Circulon before and they never fail to impress me. The griddle is heavy and manages heat really well.
2,No pictures!,There are no pictures in this recipe book. If you are a person who needs pictures this is not for you. I am returning this.
3,Good Recipes but...,"Try to find something in this book is impossible, look up grilled swordfish and you need to look in the TOC for ""grilled"" not ""swordfish"""
1,A Question,"I saw several of this series at a resort. I am familiar with several unique, small hotels in NY that would seem to qualify. They were not in the NY book (not even mentioned). Looking at the hotels that were, it struck me that the NY book at least looked like a big ad for hotels wanting to buy space. If so, the author should tell us. Additionally, the photography is fairly awful--blocked shadows, hodge-podge compositions, and a general mishmash. There are good travel books ... I'll pass on this series."
4,Good price on a great name brand Holley regulator,"I bought this regulator to use on my V8 S10 project. It works great for what it is. IMO, its not a top price regulator, but more of a budget priced unit that works well within its limitations. I would recommend it for a medium HP fuel system, say 400 HP or so. Anything above that and I would recommend going with a higher performance (read more expensive) regulator."
5,Great Grinder,"I've had a Makita XLT kit for about a year now, and there have been several occasions when I really wished that I could just snap an 18-volt battery on a portable grinder and do a small job. Finally, when my wife wasn't looking, I decided to pull the trigger--and am I glad I did. I used it immediately to cut through a metal sink drain (Think: water), a situation where a saw was clumsy and a 110v grinder would be folly. Fast and powerful cutting!I would not recommend this tool for heavy-duty, repetitive work, but smaller for jobs it is convenient and more than adequate."
2,Safety feature ruins product...,"This grinder has a safety feature that makes this grinder pretty useless. When you put too much stress on the grinder it shuts itself off... how nice a grinder that shuts off when you use it... good for light duty, cutting off nails etc..."
4,It's fine for small stuff.,"It is convenient, but that comes at a price.I don't expect battery tools to be close in power comparison to a corded tool.I have Makita impact drivers and a recip saw, and I fully endorse the tool and the batteries.The grinder however, by nature is a power hungry tool and one that is constantly having a load put on it.Not exactly conducive to being powered by a battery.Having said that, if you're using it for trimming nails, screws, light metal work, I think this is a convenient tool for that.If you are using it for heavier work, stay with the cord."
3,Overloads too easy for me,"Got my grinder with a set. Works good on things needing low power, like sharpening an ax or lawn mower blade, but if you try to do anything heavy, cut stucco or plaster it overloads very easily and turns off. I do have the corded version and I would recommend that as your main tool and this only if you get it in a set."
3,Excellent book for inducing sleep.,"I read this and still don't know what psychotherapy is. I define it as talking.Nowhere does this guy say what 'more' is needed.This is full of personal stories, which is somewhat cute, but how about giving answers instead of anecdotes?The one benefit is that reading the first 22 pages will induce a three hour nap.Good to take on a long hike, you can use it to start a fire."
3,Tedious,"A way-too-long, poorly-edited documentary. Incessant, unrelated & generic footage distracted from the subject himself. Like too many other mediocre documentaries, it attempts to reconstruct the entire era on just one video tape, and so waters down the intensity of this very interesting individual. It would have sufficed as a story of a very complex man, and his remarkable intellectual development."
5,Rick and Bubba-Stay in it!,Rick and Bubba are the best and this is one of theirs. It had me doubled over laughing so hard.
5,Extraordinary,"I have read all the Southern Sisters' series and didn't know what to expect with this book. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It is smart, funny, sad, entertaining and filled with wonderful charaacters in a great story. I am eagerly awaiting her next book."
2,Silk it is NOT,"When I did a search for silk boxers this product was displayed. I bought this product thinking I was getting ""silk"" boxers for my husband. Although these are nice boxers, SILK THEY ARE NOT. Do not be fooled. 100% polyester does not equal 100% silk."
1,"Heating lubricant, not tingling","Make sure you read about the product on the page before your purchase here on amazon, I clicked it thinking it was for tingling, read some of the reviews, and saw most people saying it burns, well I read the top of the page, and dont get me wrong, i have noticed ALL external links to the page say tingling, but it says heating at the top of this page. the picture of the product even says tingling, but its the warming lube.[...]and warming lube tends to burn women, due to some unsavory ingredients. I wont ever use warming lube for intimacy after the awful pains it has caused me.At any rate, make sure you read before you purchase!!!!"
3,Not a good as the first recordings.,"This group is one of my ALL-Time favorites for their harmony and wonderful backgroud arrangements. A few of the songs, in particular, ""Where There is Faith"" lost a lot in the re-recording. The original was one of the most beautiful songs I personally had ever heard. My old cassette (yes, that's how long ago it was) had to be thrown out, so I ordered the CD. Was greatly disappointed in their attempt to 'modernize' the arrangements.If I had never heard the originals, I probably would have been very satisfied."
2,Where's the information,"I looked into this at my local Barnes and Nobles bookstore. I've owned similar top 10 books before but this is a disappointment. For example, the book talks about ferries going to the Toronto Islands but doesn't tell you how much are the fares and how best to get there. Same thing happens to other attractions and transportation, it talks about things can be pricy, or there are multiple fares (e.g. one time vs same day vs multiple day public transportation fares), but doesn't tell you how much so you can plan ahead."
4,Shiny Toy Aspartame,"I have to admit that I like the earlier versions of some of these songs more. I'm not sure that they needed this much dressing up. It's possible that this makes me a Shiny Toy Guns luddite, but some of the artificial neurotoxic sweeteners on We Are Pilots 3.0 are just a bit too much.This is still really good stuff, from a band who deserve every bit of success that they achieve."
5,What an album!,"One day I was looking for some Synth pop (80's child) and I ran into this album on Amazon and I was hooked. I had never heard of the STG before, but now I will never forget them. Great blend of musical talent that has not been heard in a while. Thank You STG for saving us Synth-lovers. I cant wait for the new Album in Nov."
2,amatuer at best! I am very displeased with this album given the hype,"Shiny pilot poo poo yeah. I bought this album based on so many 5 star reviews and the claim that they were pop synth fun for the 21st century. I was thinking okay Cat, you are gonna like these cats, they are gonna be like space cowboys or maybe even something like pet shop boys or whatever. This album has little substance, this music is ""lite"" to say the least, the waning voice of the singer really does not do anything for me. The songwriting itself shines at times but overall the sound of this entire CD is just flat out FLAT. I was just really disappointed and was expecting a much greater showcase of talent. I would have to say bands like Coldplay or Modest Mouse fare much better in this category because these guys are trying to bring back a certain style of music that they obviously do not have the talent to perform."
1,Sadly dissapointed.,"When this CD arrived, I was excited until I played it. It kept skipping tracks. I sent it back and received another, and the same thing happened. I was told by your site that others were having the same problems with this CD title. I still wish I could have received a good copy."
5,A great book,"This book is a prelude to an incredible series. It is deep and dark, none of the characters are predictable and the plot is incredibly complicated. Unfortunately, most of those crying ""misogyny"" never finished the series - humanity is saved by the intelligence and power of a woman (other than Morn). But as for The Real Story, it is bleak and stark, and on its own would probably be mediocre (or at least pointless). As part of the best Science Fiction ever written, it is masterful. But if you like your stories where everyone is nice and friendly and one-dimensional then skip this."
5,The gap series,"If you are in any way squemish, The Gap Series is not for you. There are no shining heroes like Luke Skywalker or Han Solo. This is a painfully real and vivid portrayal of the darkest side of human nature. Take a journey into a world full of rape, betrayal, murder, deceit, genocide, political intrigues and finally redemption. Probably the best sci-fi series ever written. Satanically good."
2,Very disappointing,"I absolutely loved the Thomas Covenant series. ""The Real Story,"" however, is not recommended. Donaldson's protagonist is so predictably disgusting that I was bored rather than shocked. This is a bad book. I hope the rest of the series is not so tedious."
4,Read the Rest of the Series!,"This is a bit of a slow starter. Consider it a prelude to the other 4 books, which take this story to such mind-blowing depths that will have you reeling. The problem with this book is that it's horrific without a clear purpose or direction. Both become very apparent as the series progresses, but you must get to book two via The Real Story. Donaldson truly is a master, and does not disappoint (read the comments from the other books - almost universally 5 stars!). Read this book in 3 days, then dive into the rest of one of the best science fiction tales ever created."
2,What a great story RUINED by the consistant rape theme :-(,"Excellent story, incredible insight into the characters, and then it all gets dulled by Mr. Donaldson's preoccupation with rape and sexual humiliation and torture. Similar themes run through the Thomas Covenant series and now plays a major thread here - and why! It doesn't add anything, sheesh. It doesn't have to be soooooo vile- does it?Sex in the story = good. Torture perversion = bad."
1,Too Boring to buy the second in the series,"I tend to give quite a bit of leeway to authors when I read their books (taking into account the time that they wrote it, the author's background, and if this is his or her first novel). But when I read 'The Real Story' I had trouble keeping my eyes awake. It was amateurish at best and I had to literally force myself to finish it (which I rarely ever do). Normally, even if I don't like a book, I will finish it just to make sure that I didn't miss something or find something prophetic in the last chapter. But none of these things materialized, even in the end. Don't waste your money or your time on this one (and I hate to say that because I am a staunch believer in literacy). This book doesn't even deserve one star. Sorry Mr. Donaldson."
4,Works well.,Used it on some Daisy BB guns that have never been oiled in 10+ years. It quieted the guns noticeably. Works better than I expected and recommend to pick up a tube if you shoot any BB guns.
5,You need this...,Oil for your Co2 gun(s). Helps the seal/fix a damaged seal. When Id load a Co2 in my Crosman 356 itd leak. (I was using Gamo oil on the tip of the Co2.) With this oil it stopped the leak. Just one drop on the tip of the Co2 cartridge. I use this oil on every Co2 cartridge.My only complaint is the size of the tube & price.Amazon $6 (everyday the price keeps going up @ least 1.) &(Standard shipping) is $4.99 + Per Item $0.59/lb.Pyramyd Air $2.99 & (Cheapest shipping) is $6.50.
5,Best thing you can get.,"This product is great for my Crosman Revolver I purchased about a month ago.Put a little dab on top of the C02 cartridge, put it in, and you are good to go. Put a dab on every 2-4 new cartridges you put into your gun and you are ready and done!Provides an awesome seal for my gun by the way, too!For the price, it's unbeatable for a necessary product for gun care."
5,This stuff is great!,"This stuff is great! There is no other way of putting it. This oil helps to maintain a tight seal between the CO2 cartridge, and the the gun. It keeps everything working smooth, on my blowback pistol, too. I highly recommend it to anyone!"
4,Quite a good book,"I enjoyed it thoroughly, doubly so after I stumbled across the article on salon by the author.Keep up the good work, Lev!"
4,Stevereno and boys have some chops,"Steve and some strong sidemen bring a happy little set to us. At times it's a little ""Lounge Music"" and rehearsed but with some inventive solos. Wonderful clarinet from great Ken Peplowski and Frank Capp (as in the Frank Capp Juggernaut ) drives the group on drums. Overall a nice driving rhythm section and enough diversity to more than satisfy."
2,This cd showcases the other side of Steve,"I bet you didn't know that Steve Allen could be a jazz pianist. Well, the verdict is in and Steve succeded at his dream. Congratulations, Steve!What a wonderful job Steve did with this cd. He played like he was a natural jazz star. He also attracted a great supporting cast to help him sound brilliant. I can't say enough good things about this cd. I wish there would be more of the same to follow.The only draw back I have about this cd is the repertoire. A lot of the songs offered on this cd, I didn't know. This was probably becasue Steve used some of his origianl works and some other songs that I didn't particulary know or like.Recommendation: I Would Like To Recommend This CD"
5,"Dubus is the Master of the Short Story, Hands Down","Time and time again professors, critics, publishers, and even the common reader look to Raymond Carver as the master of the short story. This simply is not fact. True, Carver is great, but he merely skims the surface of human behavior. In this collection, Dubus's second, through Catholicism, father-son relationships, marriage, and working class New England, Dubus delivers to his readers the human with his/her warts and all. These stories are powerful as Dubus is able to make even the smallest moments sincere and heart wrenching. Stories that stand out in the collection are Contrition, An Afternoon With the Old Man, and The Bully. Read this collection. Notice Dubus's sentence variety and description. This is how one writes, and honestly, Carver could have taken a note from this master. All of Dubus's collections are amazing. Personally, I read them from earliest to his last, but anywhere is a good starting point."
3,Very good except for one important drawback.,"In my opinion this recording of Mendelssohn's Scottish Symphony is very good except that the timpani part is almost inaudible. The timpani are important in this symphony; they reinforce the sound at crucial moments. I know what the symphony should sound like, and at those many moments in this recording I have to use my imagination. That is a shame. It is the only thing that keeps this performance from being marvelous."
4,"Good, but not great","""Backwater"", by Joan Bauer, was a good book, but not one of the best books I've read.Teenage Ivy Breedlove hates living in her family of lawyers, because no matter what she wants, she is expected to be a lawyer too. Ivy loves researching her family's history, because besides her lawyer ancestors, there are the different, but interesting ones - the ones ""stuck in the backwater"". When Ivy hears about her ""crazy"" aunt Josephine, she knows she has to find her, and she starts on a journey up a mountain to meet her.This was a fairly exciting, interesting book, but not my favorite for several reasons. First of all, the storyline was a pretty unrealistic - a girl leaving her family to find a long lost aunt. Also, the spelling and grammer really needed to be edited better during the making of this book! Even so, this book was an entertaining read, quite funny at times, though it wouldn't become one of my favorites."
3,Michael Lewis Fan,"Lewis' sharp wit and effortless writing style does not come through in Money Culture. This string of dated articles seem thrown together--perhaps in an attempt to make a little money between books? However, after reading Liar's Poker I would forgive Lewis anything. It was a great inside look at bond trading. I loved it so much that I plan to read The New, New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story--even though I have minimal-to-no interest in the IT world."
1,Deceiving,"The product description doesn't make it clear that there is no mattress with the frame. It should be called a futon frame, not just futon. It describes the frame and then the mattress. Only states covers and pillows sold seperately, not the mattress. They don't even have a place where you can order the mattress. VERY DECEIVING!"
2,Weak,"Although useful for revision in certain aspects (e.g. threading issues) of such a rich subject the book is, on the whole, weak. It presents an overly simplistic discussion of the problems of dual interfaces (of which there are many) and a nauseating prosyletisation of the much flawed technology MTS. The section on COM security makes a decent attempt at improving the knowledge of the reader, but fails as the writing is obtuse and laboured.Save your money, read the COM specification, and experiment. You'll gain a much deeper understanding than that speciously portrayed here."
3,"A good read, but disappointing","After reading Essential COM, this book is disappointing. Essential COM may be the best book ever writen on explaining how COM works. Effective COM is very misleading. Many will make the mistake of assuming the author did his homework in writing this book. As an example in point 9 of the book, he suggest that connection points require five round trips and that bidirectional communication can be established in one round trip. Both figures are incorrect. Empirical evidence proves otherwise. In fact, the point he is trying to make is completely false. His suggestion is that callback interfaces can be established faster than connection points. This is completely untrue. If you write an application that follows his model of using callback interfaces, it will be slightly (15%) slower than connnection points."
2,Blech,"I love Emergen-C, and bought this one because it had zinc in it. Whoever said this tastes like propane is correct. I opened the box and thought something might have died in it and actually double checked to make sure. I had to plug my nose to get it down. Eek."
1,Causes Irregular heart beats,Starting taking this product and immediately an irregular heartbeat started.....I spent the night in the hospital.....there was another review on this site that experienced this and it was removed ironically after I reported this. I suspect certain ingredients that have been received from over-seas are poor quality....
2,covered sauce pan,"So far, it works well on a smooth top stove. Second choice when no ""green"" product available. Edited 10-13-2012: After a year or two of use the non-stick surface began to peel and become rough. I will stick with thermolon (GreenPan type) products for non-stick use from now on or use stainless steel or cast iron whenever possible."
2,not what i expected,when i received this textbook i was expecting a paperback book. not a loose leaf book. i have no time to return and re-purchase what i want and need so it looks like i will be sucking it up this semester. if you want a textbook with a binding DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
2,"EH, but you might like it if...","you like qualitative research then you might enjoy this, otherwise for me it was too academia-speak, and a bit over analytical."
5,A must have for keeping those great oldies alive!,"What a great CD! We love this and I gotta say, what great memories it brings back to me of my parents singing ""Does your chewing gum lose it's flavor?"" HILARIOUS! Great songs for great no TV time! Don't let the purple people eater get you!"
5,"Wild Arms- the good, the bad and the greedy","As expected with all quality japanese cartoons, wild arms has nearly seamless artwork and incredible visualizations. In addition, the storyline is captivating from the first minute, with a fairly straight forward plot that is still interesting enough with pits, turns and twists to make the video fun to watch all at once or bit by bit. I have enjoyed watching it at least 5 times and still I enjoy every frame."
3,Not quite good enough,"I think that Bob Daisley is a very talented bass player and musician (song writer as well). The songs that were NOT former Ozzy songs were mediocre to average. I think the Ozzy covers were OK. Daisley added more to these versions and Steve Morse did a good job playing Randy's pieces and making them his. The vocals werent good. I dont think this guy's voice is that great and he is the weak point in the band (Don Airey, i could barely hear you... and your version of mr crowley on blizzard was 10 times better).Bottom line...After the whole debacle between Ozzy and Daisley/Kerslake, they go and re-record ozzy's songs to try and capitalize on it. I dont think they did good enough job. I'd be curious to listen to clips of a new album, but Bob... Lee... dont try and revive the ozzy classics, lets see what you have now."
1,Don't Bother,"I was very disappointed by this book. As an aspiring writer I've heard any number of things that one should avoid and I've seen waayy too many of them used in this book. In addition, there are a number of typos and instances of bad grammar. It saddens me to think Mr. Rice has his books published only because he has famous parents. I hope his books improve but I won't be reading any more to see if they do."
1,Misleading Book Description,"When I read the back of the book I expected a mystery novel not a novel where almost every character is gay and the overriding theme of the book is not a mystery as advertised but rather, the homosexual exploits of the characters. This book should have been in the ""gay & lesbian"" section instead of ""fiction"". I have nothing against gays & lesbians in books or anywhere else, however, I think that when the topic is so prevalent throughout the book, there should be some small indication on the book jacket description."
1,"first book, great, second a flop!","This authors first book was phenominal! Absolutely heartbreaking and then redeeming. It seemed to be almost autobiographical. This second book, far below the quality of the first. Really had to imagine it was written by the same author. The characters werent developed well and by the end so many red herrings and unnecessary plot twists were used it was ridiculous. Leaving me with thinking the book was as believable as an old Gilligan's Island rerun. This book keeps me from really being interested in any of his current work. I will re-read the first!"
3,Yawn ... his second novel. And it shows.,"What happened between ""A Density of Souls"" and ""The Snow Garden""?? Rice mentions in his acknowledgements that he was writing this book ""during a time of transition in my life..."" - boy, I guess.This is a story that could easily have been told in about half the pages it took. The story drags and lags and uses up far too much paper in unneccessary character exposition.The story line is interesting, don't get me wrong. I finished the book and was not disappointed by the twisted ending, but the story takes a good, solid 300 pages to even get moving - by the time it has, you're just simply looking forward to the last page.Finally, I was shocked at the number of mispellings and other gramatical errors that made it past the editors (in the hardcover edition, anyway.) This book was obviously a rush job. Hopefully Christopher will get through this bout of youthful prattling and get back to what we know he CAN do based on his first novel."
3,Good Story; Bad Editing and Proofreading,"This novel is pretty good. However, it would have been a lot easier to become submerged in the story if not for obvious grammatical errors and editing problems, which kept popping up. I'm referring to the paperback version, though this may have also been true in the hardcover.......amazingly obvious things like inadvertant changes in tense (""he"" when the author is referring to a ""she""), clanging repetitions, poor grammar, etc.. I know times are tough - but geez, I'd proofread the next book free if it would help...As for the plot and the writing, this author continues to make pretty bold choices. He has his own voice - and it's probably safe to say that you haven't met a cast of characters like this in other books. It's a pretty addictive read..."
2,"Good start, but the ending lets it down horribly","I bought this book after reading the back flap. It reminded me of ""Lake of the Dead Languages"" by Carol Goodman and ""The Secret History"" by Donna Tartt.The story mostly takes place on a school campus and revolves around a couple of (not so typical) students. There is a lot of tension between them and the death of the wife of one of their teachers brings a lot of intrigue. In the end though the story goes into fast forward mode and before you know it half of the people in the story are dead. This ending was most disappointing and I expected more after such a good start.Also note that this book contains some explicit sexual content involving homosexuals. While this was not a problem for me, I thought some people might want to know."
2,Merely Okay,"I thought that the description of this book sounded fantastic. The cover drew my attention, too. I know, I should never judge a book by its cover, but I do. I have tried at least five times to read this book, but I just can't seem to get into it and stay into it. There are some parts that are very exciting and make me stay up until 3:00AM reading. These are followed by sections that I have to read over and over again because they are so boring that I cannot pay attention enough to comprehend what is going on. When it's good, it's very, very good, but when it's boring, it's horrid."
4,A charming first effort for Corrine LeBron,"The first of many excellent albums that we can expect from Corrine is ""Mi Confidente."" With english songs like ""Regresa A Mi"", ""Porque Me Amaste"" and the Spanglish ""Always Be My Baby"",Ms. Lebron is poised to become a Salsa diva. RMM Records paired her with a great Michael Stuart for ""Uno de Dos"", while she also drills a very hot ""Figurate,"" the title song, and best of all her own composition (co-written with her father) ""Las Buenas Noches."" She's got singing and dancing in her blood and you can tell she's here to stay"
5,A must have!,"We orignially bought this for our boat to keep a charge on the battery while on the lake. Then one day in the dead of winter, I came out of the mall and my battery was flat dead. I found the charger in my trunk and just laid it on the dash and plugged it into the lighter. I went back into the mall and had some coffee and when I came back the car fired right up! We now keep one in all our cars!"
3,"Good light, but has an annoying buzzing.","I like the light this bulb gives off, but I found the buzzing too annoying to have by my desk. I'll install it in the cellar."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Red is the story of a retired spy, and more particularly a very talented wetwork sort of guy, who had a deal to retire quietly, keep to himself, and he would be left alone. Management changes at the CIA, and they decide to get rid of him. Big mistake for those involved with this decision.Tokyo Storm Warning is a crazy Japanese style giant robot slugfest, where one poor little human woman has to try and avoid getting stomped on. Ok, she is a pilot type, so she isn't your average female."
5,My Two Cents,"The book is very helpful. I studied the book for about a week and passed the Sociology CLEP with 20 points to spare. I would recommend doing some online research about the prominent names listed in the book. Some questions on the test (e.g., Emile Durkeim's 3 types of suicide)are not detailed in the study guide. The practice test were helpful and if you can score high on those, the actual test should be a breeze. All in all, a good resource."
3,Poor design,"This *seems* like a great little product, but I am very disappointed. First, rolls don't fit. I have to re-roll the entire thing smaller and jam it in. The finger hole doesn't really work to push the next stamp out and the worse part is that after you get it in, if you turn it, the middle of the stamp roll falls out each side. Pretty poor design."
3,A nice musical with a great star,"Broadway's best diva, the ever original Ethel Merman sings in a show that she had a bit of a tough time with. She didn't like the composer, who apparently didn't like her either, and it shows. But it's a nice musical, with some hummable melodies, that harken back to the time when if you had an idea for a musical, and you could get a big star to do it, you'd get the backing in no time flat."
4,quick delivery,"the delivery is quick, and it is good.but the book is written a lot inside.so i just give four stars. overall, it is good."
2,Not what it sounds like.,"I bought this CD expecting some classic sounding French music. Well ... it sort of fullfills that descrption. The songs and melodies are definitely French classics. However, the performances are very bland, it sounds like most was done on ... keyboards. Gone are the authentic instruments like accordions and mandolins and in are ... synth strings. The reviewer that said that this sounds like elevator music nailed it right on the head. I love the music, but I hate the way it's done.I am going to keep looking for something that has authentic content AND instrumentation."
3,Good background music,"This is good background music; a little ""Lawrence-Welky"", but good just the same. I didn't realize that it was all instrumental when I purchased it, so I was slightly dissappointed in that regard; but the music is still good."
5,A Never Begin love story,"If you love gorgeous antique costumes and jewelleries,I'm sure you'd fall in love with this remake movie of Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece.Thanks to Bernard Rose who revealed the scenery,atmosphere colours and layouts... perfectly real.Anna Karenina(Sophie Marceau) is a young passionate bourgeois lady married to an old fashion man while Russia was under the rule of Romanov.The undelightful tittle-tattle among the courteseanshad conducted Anna to a tragic ending.It is splendid at the ballroom,amazing atmosphere,the gentlement(knights)were able to dance,holding their ladies with only one arm,this is glamorous!!while the piece of 'Swan Lake' is in the air,Anna's heart was blasted by the glimpse of a young cavalliere...Count Vronsky.The movie has a fantastic cinematography,you'll delightly feel as though you're among them.It would bring you back to the 18th century where each gesture of a character is a'book of etiquette'.And above all,to me Sophie Marceau is a cute French origin."
4,Works Great!,"Great product and works well its worth a cost. I don't like ""Plastic"" Waterways-Chrome Finish.Nice to see Made in USA!"
4,Nice quality,"I collect pewter lapel pins, so I am always looking for ones that are well made. I like this pin for that reason and the detail. It's thick and the backing is very solid."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY ...LOOKS LIKE DVD MADE IN 1947 WHEN MEL BAY STARTED BUSINESS,DVD QUALITY BAD NO WORKING SOUND.....TRY LEARNING MUSIC WITH NO SOUNDJUST ANOTHER USELESS GUITAR BOOK TO GO IN THE BASEMENT THEN TRASH
5,"Reasons to read ""Reasons to Live""","1. Amy Hempel is one of the best kept secrets of modern fiction. 2. The stories say so much without saying too much. 3. The characters earn your compassion. 4. ""In the cemetary where Al Jolson"" is buried is the greatest short story I have ever read. 5. If you have ever grieved or felt loss, you will relate to these stories."
4,Cosmo Warrior Zero - Jiurney' s End,"A very good series with some serious flaws. A shame that there appears to be episodes missing/deleted when converted for the American audience. (Love to see the original Japanese version, though). The last two episodes on this volume appear to be mis-placed add ons from the same series. A major break for the storyline and left the viewer wondering ""where's the rest"" of the episodes."
4,Thatcher will be back!,"Easy read for motorcycle enthusiasts who'd rather be on the outside, looking in, when it comes to the biker life-style. Can see this Thatcher character being developed for a TV series without too much effort. Can be read in a couple long evenings as you don't really want to put it down and if younger family members get an interest in the book, you don't have to concern yourself with X-rated language for the most part. Great lakes area riders will relate to the terrain that it covers. A light adventure...an interesting tale."
2,a little dry,"While deeply researched, this biography is a little dry for me. It's just the telling of what happened, in great detail, in my opinion without vivid language. Few direct quotes. All in past tense. This happened, then this happened, then this happened. Maybe that's how biographies were written back then (in the 1980s) but they have come a long way since then. These leaves me feeling like I'm watching this story from afar, not feeling it, never getting close enough, not touching it."
5,Forbidden and Fantastic...,"Oooo, if it's forbidden, then I feel so naughty listening to it.This is really good ""mod"" exotica music. This CD is great. I've been listening to Forbidden Sounds... for over a year now.My favorite cuts are: ""An Occasional Man,"" ""Terminal,"" and ""Da T'ing He Grow.""Cran-Tiki-Tastic!Kon-Tiki-Kev"
2,"Short, new age ambient album","This is Patrick O'Hearn's first solo CD. It comes from 1985. It is only 32 minutes long. The sound quality is excellent.This is one of those new age albums from the mid-eighties that took advantage of the new digital and CD technologies. It has a great dynamic range and beautiful sonic quatity.Like most of the early new age work, this is all about the sonic qualities and making beautiful sounds. It is not about the compositions. Like many new age albums, this is just repeated sounds; very beautiful sounds; but no cohesive composition. I find it to be repetitive and boring.There are some interesting parts to the CD, and track 6 is very good throughout. This whole CD might be OK as background music.Patrick O'Hearn got his start with playing bass for Frank Zappa. He was then in Group 87 with Mark Isham (who plays trumpet on this CD). After that, he struck it big with Missing Persons, featuring 3 other musicians who used to play for Zappa."
3,Hobbits with graves disease,"The story was ok. A bit of Constantine goes to Oz, I could have easily missed this four episode story but my beef was with the illustration. While the color was well done the characters looked like hobbits with a touch of Grave's disease. Very cheeky, short in stature and a bit bug eyed. Keep Corben away from Constantine they don't mix well."
5,These cases ROCK!!,I now have 4 of these cases that hold very expensive scanner DJ lights. The case is very well made with strong zippers and padding on all sides. Two handles are very strong and make carrying easy. I plan on buying more for the rest of my lights!
5,Perfect!!! Almost,This bag was exactly as described. It works perfectly for my two Polaroid mini Portrait Cameras which because of their size were very hard to find bags that fit. I wish it had some padded separators though. I have to use bubble wrap to keep my cameras apart. Thats just an individual need. I suspect most people would not have this problem.Good Bag!
3,Fun at South Beach,"The second in the series, this book has main character Regan Reilly in the middle of another predicament. While in Miami for a weekend wedding, her uncle is also trying to sell the patent on some apparently amazing pantyhose at a convention in town. Throw in the tension builder that the uncle is trying to earn enough money from the patent sale so that he can buy the retirement home where he lives with his friends before they are kicked out on Monday. Regan doesn't do nearly as much sleuthing in this story as she did in book one, and she saves the day at the last second but not really because she's a private investigator. As in the previous book, the plot gets bogged down a little in the middle and then has a rushed ending where all the loose ends are neatly tied up. Not necessarily convincing, but still a fun read."
1,Childish,"I'm a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark and that was the reason I picked this up. I think I read 30 pages before I turned it in at the local thrift store. Apparently parentage makes no difference if you have no talent. Haven't read any other books by her, but then I don't think I will. I see that she is still publishing her one-liners though! I thought it was just me until I read the previous reviews. The moronic story isn't even worth reviewing."
3,Disappointing,"Somehow, I expected more from the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People. If nothing else, I expected him to deal more candidly with the lines ""The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."" (i.e. I shall not lack for anything.) He does discuss it but alternates between blaming us for wanting too much (as if all our wants are frivolous) or just saying that God is always there for us, so who needs anything else. (So much for the cancer patient who wants a cure, or the tsunami victim who wanted some air and a life preserver).Also, you will find litte scholarly discussion of the text of Psalm itself -- each line is, instead, a lauching point for the sort of sermonizing you can hear in church or temple every week.Kushner's earlier work confronted the cruelty and complexity of the real world in a much bolder, more refreshing way."
2,"Just Worth Reading, Not Worth Buying","This book focuses on the 23rd Psalm, but I found it to be a bit self-centered. It is probably a great read for someone going through a time of personal grief, and I believe that is what the author intended, since he is the author of When Bad Things Happen to Good People. I can appreciate that aspect of the book, but I feel that some of his interpretations of the psalm are incorrect.One instance that comes to mind is his view of the rod and staff mentioned in the psalm. Kushner tends to view the rod and staff as punishment from God. I can understand, however, this viewpoint if one does not have knowledge of grace. A good book to help understand the metaphor of the rod and staff in regard to grace is A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23.Kushner is learned and concise with his knowledge, but fails to shift the focus from the personal and earthly to Jesus and the kingdom of God."
5,My Grading is A+!,I think it was really a great book. Especially if you wanted some pictures of the Harry Potter movie. Even though they could have put more in I think it was great the way it is.
4,Another Lucie to Love...........,"I first became aware of Lucie's vocal talents when I was lucky enough to see her in the original cast of ""They're Playing Our Song"". That was my ""virgin"" Broadway musical, and it hooked me for life. I've always wanted to see Lucie perform live in a cabaret format, and was thrilled to find this CD. You'll be pleasantly surprised by what you find here.......a very talented vocalist and a thoroughly enjoyable CD that leaves you wanting more. I still hope to see her live again, but at least I've got this CD until then."
1,"A Wretched, Horrible Mess!","Listening to this CD is worse than listening to Yoko Ono! It is just so amazing to me that someone who comes from the great stock that Lucie Arnaz does (parents were Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) could have such little, if no talent! If it wasn't bad enough that for the last several years, she has been living off her dead parents, by selling ""Lucy"" merchandise, that is mostly tacky, she has to cut an album now too! She doesn't have any of the musical talents her dad did, or the comedic ones her mom did, so Lucie, just crawl into a little hole and never come out!"
5,Those Toes! What a wonderful story!,"""Those Toes"" is a wonderful story to read to your children! It is also an easy reading book for an early reader. However, my older children (7, 10, and 12) enjoyed reading this because of the information about the animals and how many toes they have! We look forward to reading more from this author!"
4,New Def Jam SuperStar,"Verovatno jedan od najboljih pop albuma u 2005., i definitivno najbolje novo lice na muzickoj sceni. Negde na tragu Sugababes i najboljih delova benda Destiny's Child nalazi se album Music Of The Sun. Album otvara pesma Pon De Replay, iako mislite da je to jedini favorit ovog albuma, gresite, jer potencijalni singlovi se samo redjaju( Here I Go Again, If It's Lovin' that you want, The Last Time, Music Of The Sun).Album krece da skripi na samom kraju, tacnije kod poslednje dve pesme koje su stavljene bezpotrebno.Ipak za svaku pohvalu.Velika zvezda pop muzike je tu i njeno ime je RIHANNA."
5,surprisingly good,"Wasnt expecting a great album but its very good, with Pon De Replay being amongst the worst!My top 5 is:1. Rush2. Music Of The Sun3. The Last Time4. That La La5. Pon De Replay"
2,Pon de Replay is a great track,"Unfortunately, it is the only standout track on this CD. The rest of the tracks come across as filler and do not leave an impression. The tracks are not really bad per se, but they all sound the same and do not have much substance. Don't get me wrong......some people say....""well that's just reggae"" whatever, but I disagree. I love reggae and soca....and most of my cd's I can listen to and have 5-6 favorite tracks....this CD only leaves me with one. She has an alright voice, but to me it is the beats that make the difference."
2,SORRY RIHANNA I EXPECTED MORE,AFTER PON DE REPLAY I THOUGHT THIS IS ABOUT TO BE HOT BUT IT AINT MY FAVOURIT TRACKS IS THERES A THUG IN MY LIFE IS SO GOOD PON DE REPLAY:THE LAST TIME:IF ITS LOVING THAT YOU WANT:THE REST IS NOT GOOD I DIDNT BOUGHT I WAS LISTING TO IT MAYBE IM GONNA LISTING TO IT AGAIN BUT 4 NOW IT ISNT WHAT I WANT AND SHE SHOULD MAKE MORE TRACKS WITH HOT RAPPERS BETTER BUY TEAIRRA MARI SORRY RIHANNA
2,Another Lumidee...or Nina Sky possibly....,"I was excited about this CD coming out, however keeping in mind that this could be another lumidee or nina sky, and in many ways i was right! i do like her voice and the beats on this album are HOT, reggae beat over a r&b voice is something we need more of! However, lyrically i dont think it's close to 'great' or 'good'...I know she's 17 but still i don't think that's an excuse for lyrical weakness...good thing i didn't buy the CD and burned it from a friend. Overall however, it's a great dance CD, but that's about it."
3,Good CD but NOTHING SPECIAL,"I'm a Barbadian and I will be fair with my review.There is nothing standout or special about this Cd - This girl is no Jill Scott, ledisi, Yahzarah or Adriana Evans. Her lyrics are not thought provoking like those previously mentioned.She can sing but so can most of these girls who get signed to labels.My best songs here are ""here i go again"" and ""if it's love that you want""I'm a student of the early 80's reggae synthesized voice technique and although she has a good voice it is too heavily synthesized.This is an ok CD and one should not attempt to compare her to the great neo soul artists of the time....she's young, her voice is weak In vocal range and with time her writters SHOULD give her deeper lyrics to perform.My advice to her handlers is to get her rounded as an artist but funnily she sounds better doing the reggae pieces.."
5,Finally into the series!,I've been waiting until I had the books I was missing (2 and 5) before I started reading... Amazing tales and the book was in great condition!
5,correct in no way(perfect),after the gunslinger i had to read this book. It didnt leave me wanting at all that is until i finished it and had to get the waste land and couldnt find anything but the wolves of the calla
3,Regarding the audiobook version,"The story is okay. It's compelling enough that I'll probably go on to read the next one. But what I really wanted to say is that it's hard sometimes to listen to audiobooks without laughing. They're so cheesy. For The Drawing of the Three, they've hired someone who sounds like the Deep Voice Hollywood Movie Trailor Guy. You know, the one who always says ""In a world where..."" So you know... if you don't mind listening to that deep, very serious voice telling a 13 hour story (and also trying to do a variety of character voices that end up just sounding completely rediculous) then, well, go for it."
4,"Better than ""Gunslinger""","I think that while the first of the Dark Tower books (Gunslinger) was a good read, The Drawing of the Three gives a much wider range of characters. We come to regard the gunslinger as ""Roland"" a much more intimate and revealing name than the mysterious and cold name ""the Gunslinger"". I think that many will agree when I say that The Drawing of the Three is an excellent read for those that have read the first of the Dark Tower books. In my experience, it is best read in quick succession of the first. I hope to all of you that do end up reading it that you get as caught up in the story and the personality of the characters as I was. Happy Reading!"
5,Another one by the master author,I love all of Stephen King's works. And this series is just amazing. An asset to any book lovers library.
1,Bad design,"The small fry pan is poorly balanced and dangerous. Unless on a flat surface, it tips over when empty. On a gas range for example."
5,Indescribable humor!!,Ordering a less worn copy - my home is not complete w/o Kilban. Actually have a few framed & strategicallyplaced around my home. Do not hang framed business reference Kilban's in your work place as my husband was asked to REMOVE his from his office immediately. Hit's home pretty hard.My introduction was in 1976 via a birthday gift from an astute cousin.Looking @ this little gem again & again - most of it becomes more relevant.Nice to see others appreciate this humor. Another plus for Amazon fans.This humor is timeless. Purchase this & have fun! Thanks BKilban!
3,graphicsglommer,"I purchased this book based on another review on this site. However,I was very disappointed. This book may be great for a beginner but it is way too basic for anyonefamiliar with the previous Illustrator versions. I also did not like the formatting in this book as well as the formatting in other Adobe CS series books."
3,Maybeck Recital Series,"Overall the CD is quite good. Only a few of the numbers were really excellent.Arnie Fox-author of ""Compendium of Over 2000 Jazz Pianists"""
5,WOW.....Upset when it was over....so awesome that I wanted more!!!,"Okay, yall, I suck at reviews b/c I cant seem to say what I want without telling all. LOL But I had to try with this book. My Grandmother sent me this book b/c I will read anything. I picked it up 2 days ago and couldnt put it down. I got so wrapped up in the story of Ellie, Blue, and Mabel. The chacters in the book are wonderfully written. Even the supporting characters draw you in. I love Blues and Jazz and this books makes them come alive on paper!!! You can almost hear the music swirling around you as you read!! The story behind the story is just another draw of this book. I have never been SO pleased with a book. Again all I can say is WOW!!! Go Ruth for writing such an AMAZING book. I honestly was upset when it was over....so AWESOME that I wanted more!!!"
2,In The Midnight Rain,"Boring, took too long to get any action going. I only read about half of it and gave it up. Glad I got it free from Amazon, would have wasted my money paying for it. Might be great for some folks but not me."
2,Chopped up & boring,"This book goes everywhere, was there an editor? 2-3 pages of this & that. Sorry, after reading the book, then looking at the title,now I know why it is called Fly on the Wall. Those flies never seem to stay in one place for very long. It would have been 100% better if a little back ground or if there was more info. to each of the ""stories"""
2,Not comfortable Clic glasses,"I do not have much trouble finding them but they are a pain to wear. I can never figure out if they should be above my hair or below. They are too snug they pinch my nose closed or if I make them longer, they balance an inch off my face and reading is a pain. I think the standard glasses chain with reading glasses is a better idea."
4,good movie you never heard of,"excellent portrayal of a gritty ghetto that is besieged by a ruthless biker gang. one stranger is summoned back home to help clean up the streets and free his ex girlfriend from the boss man of the bikers. good movie, recommend it"
4,Absolutely crucial for Steinman fans,"This soundtrack is the only place you can find ""Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young,""a cut that Jim Steinman aficionados rank among the man's best. Steinman songs can be taken as face-value celebrations of hormonal teenage glory, or , if you find the touches of humor sprinkled throughout, taken as well-aimed parodies of rock 'n' roll's grander impulses. When ""Tonight"" achieves liftoff, though, it's hard to be a doubter. When Steinman's hallelujah chorus starts chanting, ""Before you know it, it's gone,"" you're slapping your pants pocket, searching for the keys to your old Kawasaki. Great stuff. However, a rock philosopher once said that the farther the music gets away from Chuck Berry, the thinner the pleasures become. To rescue you from that fate, the Blasters and Ry Cooder contribute terrific songs, as well as a pre-Lone Justice Maria McKee. Get a hold of this before it goes out of print."
3,Streets of Fire:A rock & Roll Fable 1984 film,The cd is ok. Not much to say about it. They're the songs from the movie. The cd arrived in great shape and was brand new.
1,Unhappy Customer,I ordered 25 clothesline tighteners for SIM Supply. They sent an inferior/cheaper product than what was ordered. They will not respond to any attempts to resolve the problem. Be aware. They are not a company that I will ever do business with again.
1,Good Music... bad editorial choices,"There's some great music on this album. That said, the idea here is that this is music by Gay composers.... and some of these guys were straight. Not convinced of the mood and, most certainly, the editorial choices were unfortunate."
4,Relaxing and Inspiring,Sit back and enjoy these 13 themes by eight of the world's greatest composers -- who just happen to have been gay.
2,The worst Ben Elton book,"Ben Elton's books are excellent. The political and social comment is intelligent, perceptive and hilarious. Unfortunately, although this book is perceptive it lacks the direction and characterisation of his other novels. The book is therefore tedious in places and lacks the laugh out loud hilarity of Inconceivable and Gridlock. Therefore read any Ben Elton book apart from this one."
5,Great content,I bought this book to assist with editing newsletter articles for our work newsletter. It provided me with the ability to stop frustrating the editor with having to make corrections.
4,Plenty of details even from the government printing office,"We purchased this book to search for evidence of herbicide use particularly in Thailand where my husband spent over a year from 1964-65. While there wasn't a great deal of usage in Thailand referenced in this book, I was mesmerized by the entire story of how Agent Orange (and pink, blue, etc.) came to be used so extensively in the Vietnam era.. I was surprised how much information was allowed to be in it as it was put out by the government printing office. A must read for anyone interested in this subject."
2,Don't bother,"John Goodall illustrates beautiful wordless books, and this is no exception (so I've given this two stars, instead of one). But unlike some of his other books our family has ""read"" (such as Paddy Goes Traveling), this does not have a very interesting plot. In a nutshell, two mice visit an abandoned castle, are locked inside and face a few perils -- each one easily handled by the male mouse, a knight -- before safely returning home. The characters are flat; the knight is brave, the lady timid. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but many traditional tales are far more interesting. Skip this one, especially if you have a daughter."
1,One of the worst albums,I detest Foreigner and Lou Gramm.He has one of the lousiest voices ever after Billie Joe of Green Day.They only produced two decent songs in Head Games and Juke box hero.Rest of their songs including Waiting for a girl like you are disposable rubbish.Do your self a favour and stay far away from all their albums.Get any AC/DC album with Bon Scott instead.
3,Definately a step up,"Foreigner's 4th-- ""4""-- was an improvement over ""HEAD GAMES"", but still no match for either of their first 2 albums. Highlights here include ""Night Life"", ""Juke Box Hero"", ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"", ""Luanne"" and ""Urgent"". Strangely, looking over the credits, I wonder if by 1981 Foreigner was becoming, like too many 70's bands still around in the 80's, victims of ""corporate rock"", for while their line-up had shrunk to 4 members, there was a major increase in the number of studio musicians adding their 2 cents everywhere."
1,THE GIRL FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA A.K.A WHIRLIGIG NEEDS TO STOP REVIEWING LED ZEPPELIN AND STONES ALBUM,"I WOULD REQUEST EVERYONE TO IGNORE THE PREVIOUS IDIOTIC FIVE STAR REVIEWER(AN ALIAS OF WHIRLIGIG) WHO KEEPS POSTING MULTIPLE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AGAINST ALBUMS FROM GREAT BANDS LIKE THE BEATLES,LED ZEPPELIN,AC/DC,THE STONES AND QUEEN EVERYDAY UNDER DIFFERENT ALIASES.THIS DEMENTED AND RETARDED KID HAS WRITTEN UNDER 50 DIFFERENT ALIASES.EVERYONE IS FED UP OF THIS IDIOTIC KID WHO NEEDS TO BE TIED UP AND BANNED FROM THIS WEBSITE.FOREIGNER 4 IS HORRENDOUS,VAPID,DISGUSTING,HORRENDOUS,SO AVOID IT AND GET A ROLLING STONES CD."
4,KATE THE ENDEARING ICON,"When one picks up a tome on a favorite show business person, the first thing is to become part of the times in which this star lived, worked and played. I feel Mr. Parish takes us to a past that most of us can not even dream of, the people and places that made up Katharine Hepburn's childhood were astounding, first in her mother's circle and then in the context of who lived and or frequented the Hartford area during Hepburn's formative years.This sets the tone on what a life is about and usually is just glossed over.The last years, that the public knew nothing about made this story all the more poignant. It was a well researched book and I never felt Mr. Parish disliked his subject nor did I feel that he tried to insert himself into the flow of the material, as many writers do.Katharine Hepburn will always be an icon to us,because of her humaness."
1,Even one star is too generous.,"Parish's efforts are nothing more than a re-hashing of everything you already know. It certainly isn't the ""untold story"" the book jacket promises. Clumsily written and boring, Parish should have enlisted the aid of a better editor. One case in point: a good editor would have checked facts and known there is no such place as Tavasoon (where he notes they filmed part of ""The Lion in Winter""), the town is actually called Tarascon. This book is pure drivel. Don't bother wasting your money."
1,Unprofessional,"Groundless, biased assertions couched in meanspirted prose. The author appears to really dislike Hepburn, and that is neither professional nor engaging for the reader. A good biographer should 1) be able to substantiate sweeping claims, especially about a subject's sexual life, and 2) maintain a neutral tone when writing about the subject, no matter how distasteful the biographer finds the actions of said subject. This author has done neither. Don't waste your time with this book even at the library."
5,Wish this were available in my own country,"I wonder why this hasn't been released over here in Europe in similar edition to the American one - the closest one that ever has been available here has only 4 same songs out of the 14 on this record. If I were RCA, I'd definitely release it worldwide rather than USA only. There's one song called ""I Guess It's Christmas Time"" that reminds in its style very closely the Swedish group Abba which back in the day used to be a very hot one here. Also it is very amazing that N'Sync can interprete some classic old Christmas songs, like ""O Holy Night"" where better credits should be given to Adolphe Adam."
5,LOVE!!!,I absolutely love this cd! There is nothing that says it is the holiday season like Nsync Christmas! I have loved these songs since I was a kid and continue to love them now that I'm an adult!
5,Excellent work guys...keep it up!!,"This is the best Christmas album I've heard for a long time! The music is fresh and festive. Some of it is pretty fast-paced, but the majority of the music just makes you want to curl up with your sweetheart by the fire and enjoy. This is definetly a must have for Christmas music lovers everywhere!"
5,This is the best Christmas album that i've ever heard.,"This album is amazing. They've added pop to Christmas music to spice it up and they did a great job of it.The song ""Loves in our hearts on Christmas day"" is the most beautiful song i've ever heard of. And ""Kiss me at Midnight"" is a great New Years Eve dance song.....all i can say is i love it boys!! Justin and Jc i love you too so much...(kisses & hugs for this Christmas)"
5,SOOOOOOO GOOD!!!,I HAVE HEARD THIS CD AND THINK IT TOTALLY ROCKS!!I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD IF YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH NSYNC AS MUCH AS I AM!!! I THINK IT IS ALSO GOOD IF YOU JUST WANT SOME CHRISTMAS MUSIC!
1,Poor Quality Control,"Shipment was as promised. When CD arrived, CD looked great. It was a Christmas present for my daughter and wrapped promptly. Unfortunately, I should of checked it better because on the back cover someone had many inappropriate anti-gay slurrs written on it. It was a shock to all that were present when she opened it Christmas morning. I was embarassed, so was everyone there. I should of knew better buying used."
2,A few good quality songs....and a buncha B.S.,"I liked SOME of this cd....Kiss Me At Midnight was a high point,the single Merry Christmas Happy Holidays is a nice song,catchier than hell.O Holy Night is a excellent song but it doens't do well a cappella,sorry boys,that one's a strike.It could have been quite good if they would have had the instrumental part,that's quite beautiful.Their version of Chestnuts Roasting On an Open fire is good too but All-4-One's version is much better, J5 did a nice cut of it too.The rest are quite dull,boring.....this cd is only for devout fans of N Sync and Christmas...."
2,Un-enthused,"For their type of music, I expected this to be a little more upbeat. Its a lot of mushy songs. They should of stuck to more classic Christmas songs. Disappointed N'sync fan. If anything, but it used."
4,You Are Like a Hurricane...,"I ""get"" this book. I get aroused reading parts of it and I get the intellectual sexpot personae of Catherine M. (As an aside, I don't get why she feels her first name is the French equivalent of, say, ""Debbie"", as in being a common post-war name. Whoever heard of Debbie the Great or Debbie Medici, or even Catherine Does Dijon? I also don't get why there is a photo on the cover of a bare-breasted woman when Catherine is so self-taken with her rear-end).She is an expert at disappearing into the eye of her own hurricane. She fantasizes and actualizes mostly sexual circumstances and then has the ability to create her own mental black hole of nothingness to withdraw into. Neat trick!! The fact that she never got arrested, beat-up, or terminally ill just adds to the mystique. She doesn't even have to worry about being fired from her job at Art Press as a result of the book's publication!Class 4 hurricane with a fixed and dilated whale eye."
1,Just what stupid men need to read,"I had to put this book down after the first chapter becuase I felt like my hands were covered in semen. This is a hastily scrawled inventory of one woman's lovers -- and they are a cast of thousands. She takes on groups of men with every orifice and yet offers the reader no more inight about these experiences than if she'd been shopping for cucumbers. She is boring, possibly troubled but who cares? I was reminded of that group of chimpanzees that stays in rut the year-round and can barely provide itself with food for the time it spends in frenzied coitus. Two things about this book made me suspicious: First of all, the author claims to have had a vigourous bout of group rutting in the midst of a migraine, taking time-outs for the vomiting. Right. The other is her claim that not once did a group of men get out of control and harm her. This is ... tarted up as some kind of cutting-edge wisdom. It should do well in college towns."
3,An Odd Movie,"Contrary to the original Puppet Master series, this movie attempts and fails at being funny. However, if you're a Puppet Master fan or collector, then I recommend this film."
4,worked well,easy install for my notebook HDD although only 1` screwhole mated with the HDD and the supplied screws did not fit. It was sturdy and easy to assemble otherwsie.
4,Quick and easy!,This was very easy to connect and set up. The directions are simple and easy to follow. It took longer to open the package than it did to connect and have the unit running.
3,In theory good product but...,"This was a much more cost efficient option versus buying a 'real' 2TB USB drive---It was a cheaper, more flexible, and perhaps more durable option. However, the jury is out on the quality of the product because the one I got would not completely format and kept giving ""Bad sector"" drive errors. I even swapped out the drive with a smaller drive that was also brand new and that drive got bad sector errors in this case. Neither drive gave any errors while in a different USB drive caddy so I assumed the particular Vantec that I had was a lemon. It has since been sent back to Amazon and they quicly replaced it. I have not unpackaged the replacement unit yet.3 stars because I am optomistic that it will work though and that it is not a piece of crap!"
5,Great Product.,Great Product. Works perfectly. The included SATA bracket is a big plus. Enables you to connect the HDD as SATA HDD (instead of USB HDD) which improves the data transfer rates drastically. Like the casing and build quality.
3,eSATA didn't work...,"This is a good case. It is very well-built, attractive, and quiet. However, I had a lot of trouble getting eSata to work... I finally got my computer to recognize the drive, but when I tried to actually access the drive, the window froze and absolutely nothing happened. I tried many different solutions, and could not get the eSata connection to work. Finally, I gave up on that and connected with USB. It works well on USB, but it was a little disappointing that the eSATA connection didn't work. I don't think it would have been worth the hassle to send back and pick another one, but if you definitely need that feature, you might want to look at a different product."
2,eSATA not work,"I purchased this enclosure and WD 1.5 TB SATA HD(WD15EARS) last week. Enclosure looks nice. Put the WD 1.5TB HD in, connected to my laptop with USB cable, works fine. Then I switched to SATA connection. nothing happened. My laptop (windows 7 OS) just couldn't take it. I tried to reboot the laptop, no luck. Google it, couldn't find any answer. eSATA is the main reason I bought this model."
4,Works as expected,"No different than hooking up an external IDE USB HDD, except the internal connection is SATA and not IDE. The look and feel is very polished so it doesnt look like an ugly brick when on top of my computer. The only thing that did not work as expected was the SATA connection to the little expansion insert. When everything was connected I could not see the drive. Once I reverted back to USB everything was fine. It would have been nice to have the native SATA speed but I personally can live with the USB connection."
5,Amazing writer!,Her storytelling is vivid and her characters are so realistic. She has become amongst my favorite authors!
4,a child's life played out against Nigeria's larger struggles,"Kambili is fifteen. She lives with her mother, and brother in the house completely controlled by her over-bearing Christian father whose ideas of ""keeping the faith"" include numerous forms of torture. The story of her life is played out against the larger struggles of one of Nigeria's many coups.The story is well-written, and does a fine job of exploring Nigerian custom, life in the big and small cities in Nigeria, and the differences between religious fanatics - Catholic and others."
5,"Cheap, works.","As some other reviewers have said, this ink just works. I've experienced no problems so far on an HP Deskjet 940c."
5,At least the delivery was fast...,"I got this item in 4 days from Villanova (the seller) in Florida.The ink cartridge, however, did not work. Amazon website indicated that this is compatible with my HP Deskjet 712c. It fit my printer. I saw no notable differences between this one and the original one I got from HP. But the printer simply did not like it. The light indicating a problem with the ink flashed constantly and the printer would not print anything, not even black and white.I have contacted the seller and am waiting for a response. I will update this review in the future.UPDATE:The seller responded very quickly. The customer rep figured out that Amazon website was wrong. This cartridge was for 710C, NOT 712C. The seller then sent the correct cartridge and a return label for the incorrect one. I am very impressed with the service."
3,"Good, But Leaves Much to Be Desired","Johnson is a matchless New Testament scholar and his output has been on the whole, very helpful. However, this book leaves much to be desired. The comments on the various passages are too short and Johnson does not provide much help for the pastor preaching on Luke's gospel. His interpretation, of course, is orthodox, there is just too little with which to interact. This is a jr. hamburger, when steak is needed. There are other more helpful commentaries."
3,Price is right,"Price was right! Not a ton of room between dumbbell hex hooks. Tried to start with 10# hex dumbbells on top and it was too tight for 15# on second hooks. Engineered for 5# hex to 40# hex in 5# increments or smaller. Comes assembled. Was first concerned about tipping over with narrow profile, but it really sits quite steady. Happy with despite tight spacing of hooks and a few rust spots on chrome top. Small profile makes for much more organized gym space."
4,Solid Performer,"I have had mine for over a year now, still have my old Makita 1020, I have found only 2 issues with the LS1013FL. The first was I had to remove the fence and redrill all 4 holes a touch bigger to be able to square the saw up, This is the second Makita I had this issue with. The second is in order to move the laser from the left to the right of the cutline takes a lot of tweaking to get it accurate. Other saws out there are a flip of a switch and you are done, hence I leave mine set to the left all the time. Poweriwse the saw is more than ample and would recommend it."
1,WORTHLESS,"These are impossible to keep on my face. I threw them away because they were so wierd. The ear piece extended behind my head, causing me to look like a dorky alien.. Don't bother"
4,Mostly Excellent,"At last! An unloseable pair of glasses. They stay right where you need 'em, when you need 'em. Before, if I carried glasses in my shirt pocket, they fell out every time I bent over. If I carried them in a pants pocket, they got bent, scratched, or both. No more of that, anymore.Like an earlier reviewer, I'm an educator, and the students seem to think these glasses are some kind of fashion statement. Well, I'll take hip any way I can get it---at age 58, it isn't easy. :)My hat size is 7 3/4 and, with the frames at full extension (they are adjustable), I get a perfect fit. Someone with a larger head might have a real problem wearing them, however, and that's why I subtracted one star from the product rating. Otherwise, these are great reading glasses."
4,Clic Reader Glasses,"Bought them for my husband for Father's Day and he wears them all the time. The only thing is that the ""rope"" part is almost not long enough for him to wear comfortably with his collared business shirts and therefore they become ""un-clic'ed"" when they are around his 17 1/2"" sized neck. We have extended the length out as far as it will go but could use a little more. He still wears them everyday. If I can find a longer version, I wouldn't hestitate to buy him another pair - might even buy some for myself!"
4,NICE PAIR OF READING GLASSES,THE CLIC READER IS A NICE PAIR OF GLASSES. I PURCHASED A PAIR FOR MY FATHER-IN-LAW FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE HAS REALLY ENJOYED THEM.
1,Questionable,"This is a good product but questionable for women. The back strap has to go around the head, so if you have a hair-do that will get messed up, this will do it. Great for men."
5,Great for making sure your glasses don't get lost,"Convenient and comfortable to wear, great color and practible. Love them, haven't had to look for me like other glasses"
1,DO NOT BUY - This is CRAP,"I no longer print too much so it took a while for this issue to come out but I am now very disappointed. When I print the black is illegible, blots of ink, almost sheared characters. I curse the day I ordered this....BUYER BEWARE: it is NOT CANON, very misleading"
4,Helpful Hints for this Cartridge,"My first PG 40 lasted only 2 months, disappointing as cartridge cost was one of deciding factors in buying my Canon Pixma MP 170. $20 (Staples) was low compared to previous printer cartridge but not for two month usage. With next cartridge, I used ""fast"" print option and continued to use for 1-2 months after ""low ink"" message appeared, this one lasted 5-6 months, which is o.k. for cost. I then had one refilled at Cartridge World and it lasted only 45 days, tho I was doing somewhat more printing during that time period. Use ""fast/draft"" option,and ignore low print message,--- just print till it's out of ink ----and it will last much longer. I will probably buy from Amazon as cost is lower (providing you order $25 and get free S & H) and this is hard to find in my area."
4,Evaluating Canon PiXma Ink,A very good in supply is obtained at all times without leakage of ink or smudging of the paper or clogging of the printer. The reason it is not rated 5 stars is that the ink supply is utilized too rapidly and the expensive cartriges have to replaced too frequently.
5,the cartridge works better than the printer,"the printer itself is lousy, and we have ordered a different one, and would not recommend it, but the print cartridges never let us down the two years we put up with this poor printer."
5,Comfy work shoes,"I am a chiropractic assistant and on my feet alot,I wear these shoes to work and my feet do not hurt at the end of the work day !"
4,She Entertains!,"This CD is a perfect example of AM's career: it is a beautifully packaged CD (with ""groovy"" photos) that contains some condesending lyric notes from Marisa Fox. Unlike many sex symbols, AM began singing in nightclubs; true, her seductiveness added to her appeal, but she had the talent to back it up. This long overdue CD shows AM's singing talents with such songs as """"More Than You Know"" (better than Streisand's dull version) and ""The Good Life."" However, AM's best songs were excluded in this compilation: her ""Begin the Beguine"" ranks with Johnny Mathis's definitive version, her ""Baby It's Cold Outside"" with Al Hirt is sexy and funny, and her ""Bachelor in Paradise"" version was introduced on the Academy Awards Show. To really judge AM's talent, you need to buy the boxed set. However, who's quibbling when you get AM on CD?"
4,Something special,Set the critical approach aside. I don't know if she can sing at all but there is something special that Ann Margret conveys. I wish there were other albums out by her. I could listen to her all day long.
4,Easiest way to make your own postcards!,"I love taking photos and am one of the few folks who still likes to write letters and postcards to family and friends who are far away. This product allows me to quickly and easily turn my own photos into postcards; easy to use and makes a special gift for those receiving a personalized postcard. Packaging is a bit weak, but product is never damaged."
2,Caveat Emptor,"There is also a two-tape VHS set of this serial put out by Passport Video, which is apparently a copy of the inferior DVD that has gotten such bad reviews here. Do not confuse this with the excellent VCI VHS set."
5,One of the greatest CD'sI have ever heard!,"I listen to a lot of jazz, I mean a lot. Great moments with Ernestine Anderson is one of the greatest expressions of true and unmatched talent by any singer inclusive of Sarah and Billie. Ernestine's range is unbelieveable and what she does with Skylark is absolutely amazing. If you are serious about jazz, this is a must in your collection."
4,Very Helpful Resource,This is my 5th pregnancy and I have used other books in the past. I found this one during my last pregnancy and really liked it. So I sought it out again this time. I appreciate that I can keep all of the information about my pregnancy in one place. It has helpful info included but doesn't get bogged down with tons of reading material. I also like the compact size that makes it easy to tote with me to my appointments. It has a special place to document what happens at each appointment so I can record it before I forget...and a place to log in questions to ask at the next appointment. Very helpful resource.
2,so much just doesn't apply to me,"I tried for a few weeks at the beginning of my pregnancy to fill this out, but it's time consuming and a lot of what it asks doesn't apply to me (as a single mom). I pretty much gave up after less than a month and it's in a drawer somewhere-total waste of money for me. That said....if this is a first child for you and your husband-it'd probably be a great thing to have."
5,Super book to go along with the companion book,"Just had to get this for my daughter in law, it's a great companion piece, just had to send it to her."
3,Waste of money,It might be good for some readers. I found it to be a complete waste of money. Too many things to fill out. To time consuming.
3,Great Organizer,"The only thing I didn't like was there are no pockets to put papers, phamplets, etc from the doctor/hospital. Otherwise I think the pages are great and has plenty of places to record your information."
3,Too Many Meaningless Details,"At first I was happy at the level of detail in this book, especially as compared to ""Contents Under Pressure"". There was a lot of good information about the early years of the band. But as the book got into the albums I find the details mind numbing. And it seemed like the details were presented in some template fashion so that the description of each album followed an identical formula and only the names of the producer or the engineer was changed. There was very little about the message intended for any song. Even the personal problems faced by Neal Peart was were dealt with briefly while the discussion of the engineer on the next album went on into tedium. I guess this is a worthwhile book if you are a Rush fan, but it is very hard to read much at one time."
3,RUSH FOR DUMMIES,"""Acclaimed Marillion biographer"" That's your first clue.If you look closely you won't find any reference to interviews with the members of Rush anywhere. That's because there aren't any. Only quotes from old interviews. If you want tidbids from past tour caterer's this is the book for you. The other annoying thing about this book is on every page there are little cartoon like blurbs with tiny little bits of information. It's the exact same format as the ""Windows or any other book for Dummies"". If you look hard enough, you might find some pictures to look at as well. The book lacks any decent photography. Nothing in color and some good pictures of buildings where Rush once had been. The other non clear pictures are all pictures you've seen before. The book was well researched but for a definitive biography that doesn't include Rush isn't all that definitive. I suggest buying ""Contents Under Pressure"" At least it's authorized by the band."
3,Not the Book Rush Fans Have Been Waiting For,"For Rush fans it's worth a read but really not quite as in depth or analytical about the music itself - nor does it contain enough technical details about the albums, which I think is what Rush fans really want to know about (at least I know I do). In fact it barely mentions some key tracks on their major albums. It's also kind of repetitive and a little too smug and clever for its own good. Sometimes it seemed like it was looking for drama that just really wasn't there. This isn't Motley Crue's The Dirt so all there really is is the music. Still, it's a book about Rush and the early years are the best part. It's good, just not great. We need a book that has a track by track analysis of all their records - that's what I'm waiting for."
5,Fabulous!,"This is a wonderful Lovejoy story! For one we see Lovejoy in his element of sussing out antiques all throughout his own beloved East Anglia. No foreign shores in this story. For another we get lots of wonderful information about pearls (how they're made, how they're graded, and most importatantly of all, how to fake them - its' a Lovejoy after all). There are a lot of characters in this little book, and unless you've been faithfully reading like I have, you might get confused. I suggest that you read these stories in order. It helps when you're trying to decipher characters, and anyway, they are just so good. Lovejoy is a marvel, and loveable even though he's a first-class rogue."
5,Love it,"Love this knife! It's a perfect fit for pockets. The blade is sharp and durable. The grip is very ergonomic. I have had this knife for years and take it with me everywhere - Camping, fishing, personal protection. I lost it during my last kayaking trip and was very pleased to see my replacement available on amazon for this price!!"
4,A good mystery with some easy to grasp economics lessons.,"I highly recommend this book. Besides being an enjoyable read, it also teaches some basic economic concepts. Taking place in England in the 1960's, the book has an enjoyable feel.Perhaps the highest praise I can say for it is that I have read it 3 times. Something I generally never do with murder mysteries."
1,Dissapointing to say the least,"The text ""claims"" to come with Minitab 14 and thats exactly the reason I bought it. The CD only has tutorials which by their very nature are useless. Most of the pages in this book are dedicated to teaching ""how to use Minitab"". I feel the help options it the program itself are more informative not only about statistics in general but also how to generate desired tests on the program itself.Minitab is by far one of the most user friendly packages around, no tutorial book is essentially required to know the fundamental basics of using Minitab. 10 minutes of playing with it sould suffice for this whole book.Carver has obviously composed this book for either the computer illiterate or just to gain royalties. I sincerely dislike the very existence of this book."
3,"Same music, great packaging","This is a Japanese *only* release. The idea was to use Queen/solo songs that were used in Japanese commercials. A different tracklisting was originally planned with several Freddie Mercury songs but there were some ""rights issues"" so they were left off. The record label decided to use some Queen songs that were featured in motion pictures to replace the solo tracks.The songs are how they appear virtually everywhere else in the world so I won't repeat myself here.However, the Japanese packaging is what makes this a good buy for a Queen collector. It comes in a purple slipcase, inside is a 30+ page booklet (which is too big to fit into the jewel case itself) that features lyrics to the songs in both English and Japanese, color photos and an interview with Brian May.A nice little addition to your collection."
5,Great instructional DVD,This DVD is very comprehensive and easy to understand. I learned a lot about the basic moves and how to string them together. I would recommend this to anyone interested in Muay Thai or MMA style fighting.
2,Drop this movie,"Jason Lee and Crispin Glover play two small-time crooks in a small-time Texas town (that looks remarkably like Austin). They dig up a dead woman to steal her necklace and end up ""kidnapping"" her and holding her for ransom from her husband. Supposedly, hilarity ensues, but I must have missed that part.Crispin Glover creates a very believable, original, and funny small-town hick, but it feels like Jason Lee isn't even trying, and the movie definitely suffers from that.There's a good amount of gratuitous nudity in several scenes that take place in the local strip club (The Mean-Eyed Pussy Cat) and even in the morgue. If you're looking for nudity go for this movie. If you're looking for anything else, don't bother.Overall this movie moves along slowly and without too many laughs. I checked it out because it was filmed in Austin and I was interested, but it's really not worth the time."
2,returned,"This did not fit my dog at all. It is probably a great product, just did not work for my needs."
2,Very small,Thought this would be perfect for my dog. He is 12 pounds and it was much too small for him to fit comfortably. Quality seemed good but size was inadequate.
5,Great purchase!,"I'm so glad I got this car seat. My 3lb Morkie puppy loves it. He can lay down and stretch out completely in it now, so he still has some room to grow. He stays so calm in the car and I can relax because I know he's safe. We travel 2 hours to and from our camp every weekend and he just sleeps most of the trip. He loves being close to us and being high enough to see outside. I love that it doesn't take up a ""person seat"" like most other pet car seats, so we can still have two people in the back comfortably. The seat is well made, easy to install, although a little bit of a pain to take out if you need to use a different vehicle. I would suggest getting two if you alternate vehicles often. All in all a great product, very well made, and worth the price!"
3,Good Chinese rip-off of a good lock,"This lock is actually made by Morning Industry, a Chinese company - not by Weiser, as stated in the description. It is designed after the Weiser cypher-lock, that has been around in most hardware stores for some time. They are both ANSI Grade 2 locks, which means that they may have some serious problems. For example, I don't think that the keyway of either of these locks is ""bump-resistant.""I won't go into detail here, since I reviewed the Weiser version of this lock, already."
2,Quit working after 2 months,I had this on my vacation house and it quit working after 2 months. Probably because it was on a metal door as this model tends to short out. Won't buy another one.
5,A Fabulous Piece Of History!!,"This album is exciting........Through certain circles,I found out that the bass player, (John Livingston Tunison IV).... AKA J.T.Livingston.....helped arrange a lot the musical parts and was in the famous midwest cult band, ""Manitoba Hugger""....He also is the lead singer on ""Promotion Man and Lazy Woman"".....Don Francisco,The drummer, played with ""Linda Ronstat"" in the 70's and ""The Big Wakoo"".....and has a fabulous sense of timing and rhythm....Michael Stevens wrote all of the songs (with the creativity of J.T.Livingston).....and he was in the band, ""Atlee""....By the way,The bass player is now a well established guitar player/ multi instrumentalist/ song writer in Cal. and has a couple of new CD's coming out...I do not know the whereabouts of Don Francisco or Michael Stevens...."
1,stick with oem products,failed after a few months use with my toshiba centrino laptop. targus would not honor warranty because they claimed that the power adapter was not meant to be used with my particular model. can't think of a a more bogus explanation for poor quality.do yourself a favor and avoid this pricey paperweight. stick with oem equipment
5,buy of the year!,ive never found this product at a price like this! exspecially with both ac/dc im happy with my order and i love how quik it came
2,Too heavy,"Once I've it, I was very dissapointed with the weight of this power supply. It is not confortable at all to travel with it. I'm still using the one that came with my notebook."
5,Works with Dell 600M and I think Avertech....,I originally bought this item for an Avertech laptop I was trying to fix. Laptop is fully dead but it did power a Dell 600M. Good product.
2,Where are the sources?,"A 'little known' true-crime murder mystery worth dipping into. The author has moments of creative narrative. But not enough to sustain the reader through pages and pages of reprinted document text. One would expect that a book of this kind, one that purports to be a ""true account"", would have sources listed at the end, or footnotes, or end notes, or any kind of notes to verify that the author didn't just make this stuff up. It is customary in nonfiction to cite sources."
1,"BUYER BEWARE!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS ""BANZAI"" DISTRIBUTED VERSION!!!!!!!!!!","THIS IS A GREAT 80'S CHEESY NINJA ACTION MOVIE BUT WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS POORLY TRANSFERRED VERSION OF THE FILM DISTRIBUTED BY ""BANZAI"". IT'S BLURRY, THE COLORS ARE OUT OF WHACK AND YOU NEED A HEARING AID JUST TO LISTEN TO IT!! IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE RECORDED A CRAPPY VHS TAPE ONTO A DVD AND DECIDED TO SELL IT THROUGH AMAZON INSTEAD OF ""BOOTLEGGING"" IT ON THE STREET! BUY THE WARNER ARCHIVES VERSION THAT LOOKS CRISP, CLEAR AND HAS A GREAT SOUND TRANSFER(YOU DON'T HAVE TO TURN YOUR TV ALL THE WAY UP JUST SO YOU COULD BARELY LISTEN TO IT!). DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DISH OUT THE EXTRA $4 OR $5 BUCKS FOR THE WARNER ARCHIVES VERSION, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!"
3,Works as advertised,Not a whole lot of improvement so I guess my problem is mostly because of obstructions [trees & weather] and not just weak reception. Seems to have boosted the signal but still get drop out in inclement weather.
5,PCT amplifiers rock,This PCT product performs just as flawlessly as the previous two that I have purchased and am still using (all indoors). I have had uniformly bad experience with inexpensive amplifiers from other vendors. My problem had been the large amount of video cable splitting required to provide service to all household location. The PCT units have enabled household wide video distribution of both analog and QAM digital channels with good end picture quality.
2,Doesn't work well in two-way.,The amplifier doesn't work as described. It doesn't work very well at all with Video On Demand on digital cable systems.
1,No Dice for Me,"Bought this last year for our travel trailer. After connecting it, I tried the channel that is on the fringe and noticed no discernible difference at all. I rechecked my connections, but all were as supposed to be. I literally went back and forth just making sure it wasn't making at least some bit of difference. Nothing. I finally just gave up and left it disconnected."
2,Fair product,Tried this product to boost my digital cable signal. As per the product information in came in short in performance. Especially for the cost. It's over priced for what it does!
3,"It works, but what about interference?","As I was told, under the supposedly simple white shell is the same amplification hardware as the comparable Motorola device. It's a relatively simple setup. Raw drop feed goes in, as does power fed from an included adapter and through any handy coax line, and boosted signal comes out, ready to split off. I cannot reliably rate this item very highly because, although it works as predicted, the main reason I chose this was to see if I could boost signal to a house that had a lot of plugs and not have the cable company coming along complaining of RF interference (which was what forced me to pull the last amplifier I was using). This is something I just don't know for certain yet. Oh, and one catch. Even boosted, if you're using a cable modem, don't split the boosted signal too much before breaking off to the modem. Performance still seems to deteriorate."
3,lack of comucations,received item as shown but i e mailed the company 3 times and no replybut the papers that came with it said to emaie them with questions. looks like most of them once get your money we can go to hell. will never buy from them again!!!!!
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this to go with my FZ50 (which I love) and I wish I hadn't. As other reviewers have mentioned, the case is small; the camera doesn't even fit in it straight--you have to angle it. The top handle ripped off after a few months of use, and now the zippers are giving me trouble. Do yourself a favor and order a Samsonite bag instead."
3,Camera bag review,"I was looking for a larger bag, one that was not as compact as the Pansonic case. It would have been helpfut to see the interior or have the dimensions for my review."
5,This book is the greatest,"hi, this book shows the incredible bond between Thowra and his lovely daughter who is exactly like him but she was restless staying in the Secret Valley and her mother is due to have another foal would be a silvery horse or a different horse, then one day Kunama (the filly) ran from home and was captured by a powerful horse and captured by Man too.Will she be able to free herself and be a brumby again???? or would she be a tame horse with a spirited heart that belongs to the freedom????? read and find out!!this book can be for young or older people. you'll love this book!!!"
4,Panasonic FX01 case,"It is well made and fits the Panasonic FX01 like a glove. However, because of the flat finish, it tends to get dirty easily."
5,IS THIS BOOK IN SPANISH/SWEDISH & IS VOLUME III IN THE WORKS!? OUR MEGA BOOKCLUB IS READY & HOPING,"We have read basically all of Davies works - Davies is an established icon of historical writers!A third volume would be so great!Dr. Davies, The world awaits God' Playgroud, Volume 3.Are any of Davies works available in other languages. The following are some of his must reads:God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 1Europe: A HistoryHeart of Europe: The Past in Poland's PresentEurope at War 1939-1945: No Simple VictoryRising '44: The Battle for WarsawWhite Eagle, Red Star: The Polish-Soviet War 1919-1920 and ""The Miracle on the Vistula""The Isles: A HistoryThank you Dr. Davies for all your writings, objectivity, credible and just good ol' pure truth.God's Playground Vol. 3 - !Por Favor!"
2,"All the best included, a little surprise plus an AWFUL Remake...","Definitely, Tavares is not one of the BEST groups of the Funk/Disco era.That's why I don't understand the reason to include an AWFUL Disco-ed remake of ""Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel"", maybe their only great superhit.However in this CD, you will also find 'It Only Takes A Minute' and 'Whodunit', other of their minor Disco era hits, plus a very nice and not widely known Cover of Daryl Hall & John Oates Superhit 'She's Gone'. Worth to give it a try..."
1,tavares greatest hits,"Being a musician all of my years ; HIGHLY disappointed with the ""remake"" of Heaven Must be Missing an Angel ! What a farce ! Spent the money for what ? & to never play again . SHAME . Don't be a sucker like I was . Such a great song to be Ruined like that ! Beware ."
3,only Wonder bread fits,"The toaster looks great and works well enough, but the slots, while wide, are much too short. Any bread other than Wonder-bread type does not fit and has to be cut in half."
2,More opinionated than informative,"Steyn isn't all that great a writer to begin with. But once you get past his clumsy prose, you find that he's more blustery than insightful. His view that the Broadway musical has died is particularly funny in a time when we're seeing brilliant new musicals like ""Ragtime,"" ""A New Brain,"" ""Floyd Collins,"" and ""Parade,"" when incredible new writers are just becoming visible, and when writers like Sondheim, Kander & Ebb, and others are at the top of their game. Steyn is nothing more than a cranky, old guy who hates that musical theatre has gone to new places and created new rules that he doesn't understand. He longs for the old days, but who in his right mind would ever ask an art form to go backward?"
1,Wannabe,"Probably the only person who was thrilled that the Minister was killed by his wife was Ludwig, as it coincided with the release of this book. This of course led to more TV time to promote it. That sales are stil dismal, despite that good luck, tells you just how awful this book is. Ludwig is a wannabe expert with pulled from the sky theories and makes no effort to explain how she reached them. Whatever Ludwig pays her agent it isnt enough as no one with such mediocre talent gets on more shows than her. I want my money back."
2,Disappointing,"First of all I cant help thinking whenever I hear Ludwig on TV that she logged off the internet 5 mins before airtime and is now telling us her newly learned theories. I get the same feeling from reading this book. Alot of her writing seems like guesswork and speculation and I have to wonder how many spousal murderers she has actually spoken with. High powered friends King and Grace add somre name recognition to help sell some copies. It would be interesting to see what someone more qualified, like a psychiatrist, would write on this subject instead of a cable TV hack like Ludwig."
1,Not so good.,"This mat is essentially a thin towel with rubber rivets on the bottom for traction. I'm a pretty big guy at 6'0"" and 230 lbs. I could not use this mat for yoga at all. The mat slips A LOT! My feet would end up getting bunched up in the mat and it ended up being more distracting and uncomfortable than anything else. I think that I am going to try one of those thick rubber mats instead. Good luck!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ......,"Sorry, I must have dozed off for a minute. I read the reviews, I liked the summary on the back cover and the title sounded good, so I decided to purchase this book. I guess I'm missing something because I just couldn't get into the story. It was boring to me."
2,Not that great for the 2001 exam,"I don't know how often the CLEP Board changes their test layout but I agree with the reviewer from Littleton, CO. This book covers only 30-40% of the material that was asked on the April, 2001 exam. Reading past reviews misleads you to think if you read this book you'll fill in answers very quickly. This book doesn't prepare you in that manner therefore taking the exam required intense thought and doing the process of elimination."
4,"Good, but you probably need other knowledge and common sense","I purchased this book a few weeks before the exam, took the practice tests, read over the review twice, and finally took the remaining tests which I found to be more difficult than the CLEP exam itself. I passed the CLEP with a 76. The book is helpful in passing the exam, but you will also need some common business sense. I also got some answers from other courses that I took such as Economics and Management."
4,Well arranged and very well written,This book helped me very well preparing for the clep examination offered at the Base Education office. Without the aid of this reference I don't feel my chances of passing would have been close to what they are. The references in the book are a little weak in calculating prices. If you don't have some experience in economics look forward to seeking further assistance. It is needed for the exam. Thanks Amazon... Gunnery Sergeant Walker
4,First time cleper,"This book is a good source. I used this book and Marketing (Barron's Busines review) text, which I proabably did not need. I studied this book for about a week and a half. I passed the clep with a 62 and you only need 50. If you are not familiar with internet marketing you may want do a small reveiw in that subject along with this book."
3,"Worth the money, but...","This book is a good book in the sense that you have 3 real practice tests and the chapters are very short. This book omits marketing tactics used for the internet. If you have a basic understanding of micro/macro economics, that is definitely going to help you on this test. Overall, an easy CLEP exam that doesn't require an inordinate amount of study time to pass."
4,Best Test Preparation for the CLEP: Principles of Marketing,You will have to study to pass the exam. This book helped me and was a great resource...I passed the exam with a 66. Marketing for dummies was also a big help and very easy reading.
4,Good for a younger reader,"I picked up this book for 2 aussie dollars ready for my flight back to the uk, and as far as time killers go i cant fault it. In fairness i would say its aimed more at 13-16 year old readers and the language reflects that, but it doesnt detract from the fact that the story is told well, and maintains a good level of interest. It reminded me of Stephen Lawhead books, which i would imagine most people would agree isnt a bad thing, and some would say just because it doesnt have metaphors which merit an ""after the water-shed rating"" its not just aimed at younger readers and thats so, but its just lacking that extra bite for my tastes. Still, on a long haul flight,and for 2 dollars, it did me proud!"
1,Why did I put myself through this!,"I read the first book, it was not good. But I read the 2nd one to see if maybe there was some hope.Nope, figgered this one out on page 12 just like the other one!Good heavens!Oh, and if you want Brooks to lecture to you about homeless people ad nauseum then read ahead! Some of the lectures in this book were straight from the writer to the reader, with no characters in between. A note to Mr. Brooks: DON'T EVER TALK TO ME WHEN I AM READING YOUR BOOK!Oh and his scene descriptions are so detailed and looooooooong, you just skip over them to get to where the characters are actually speaking instead of moving through these long boring scen descriptions! (Terry, go talk to Stephen King. That fool can give a decription of an area in like five words and it's better than your FOUR PAGES of scene description...(no I'm not lying FOUR PAGES!))Do not read this book or this story, it is atrocious."
1,Never use oncesoldtales,"Tried to cancel order two hours after placement. I was ignored by oncesoldtales.All emails are verified and logged with Amazon. I had to give them a one star rating, it will not let me go any lower."
1,Reality crashes into fantasy; thirty die in collision,"Mixing fantasy with reality is a decent concept; 'A Knight of the Word', however, is a casebook example of how not to pull it off. Though the first book in the series, 'Running with the Demon', was at least readable, this book is horrid. All throughout the book, the hero continuously demonstrates his incredible power of whining. Having lost a single battle, he suddenly considers himself unfit to fight. Of course, there's no free will when dealing with the Word and the Void, so we know that by the end, John Ross will be either staff-swinging or dead no matter what he wants to do. Then there's the 'look at the bad stuff in the newspaper' scene. This came off very cheesy and cliched in the first book; when Brooks repeats it using Ebonics in this book, it's not much better. Throw in a series of lame, easily-predictable plot twists, and you've got the makings of a genuinely bad book."
5,Enjoyable soft-mystery-type romance/Alaska,"This is from the cover:The Great White North.Brand Lockwood would never forget the collapse. The earth rumbled. Steel girders tumbled to the ground. Concrete crumbled. As the dust settled, Brand made a promise: Never again would he be a victim of another man's negligence and greed. He would manage his own construction sites, even if it meant taking jobs in the isolated wilderness of Alaska's Klondike region.Kara was accustomed to physical labor. Despite her slender build and silky black hair, she could handle a bulldozer as well asany man. She needed the job on Lockwood's crew in the Klondikebecause her family needed the money and Kara needed...some answers. She had to know the truth about the collapse of her father's building site. And only Lockwood knew the facts that could save her father's reputation. Determined to extract the truth, Kara was about to push Brand to the limit."
1,waste of my money,Purchased this product because it seemed to be a natural alternative... claims are highly over-rated. DON'T waste your time or your money. Product did not work. I took it for a few weeks just to be certain.
3,Mixed feelings,"I have not shown my daughter television until recently when I had a moment of weakness and rented this from the library. Overall it was highly entertaining, even for me. My daughter is two and we learned a few of the songs together, which I guess made it worth it (even though I regret showing her TV and have not rented any more videos). My complaint about it, which I noticed was a complaint another reviewer also had, is the way the characters talk to each other. The director character is especially rude and sarcastically calls the contestants ""you geniuses"" at one point. I don't think this is appropriate for an Elmo video! Still, the songs are adorable. We particularly enjoyed Kermit's song about elbows as well as Ernie and Elmo's song about the face."
1,I never thought I'd see the day.....,"....when I would find sex so boring! But somehow this author, like my ex-wife, managed to pull it off!!! The prose is plodding and the material is disorganized. If you've read and enjoyed other ""natural history of"" books, you will be bitterly disappointed by this one. The author lacks the ability to wax poetic about her subject like Diane Ackerman. There are also few good scientific yarns or the kind of gee-whiz stuff that you might expect--or hope--from a book about one of the primary preoccupations of mankind! Wait for the movie."
2,Will not fit in certain Focus models,"This wiring harness is good for *most* Ford Focus models in the years listed, but not all. Specifically if you have one of the 2003-2004 models with the Blaupunkt stereo you will need the 17-1784 harness instead (one that is made primarily for VWs and Audis, but for some reason also for a couple specific Focus models). I have one of those Focus models and trusted the Amazon model checker which said this harness would work in my car when in fact it did not.It would behoove you to pull out the stereo first just to check which harness you need before ordering one, especially if you have a 2003-2004 Ford Focus.I can't really comment on the quality of this product as I was unable to use it."
1,Does not fit all that is described.,Bought this along with my install kit and headunit for my truck. I have a 98 Ford Ranger and this wiring harness WILL NOT FIT. This is no where near the correct plug for the 98 ranger. Even tho they say this is for an 85-04 Ford Truck/SUV. This is NOT true. I went to wally-world and bought another wiring harness (since I didn't want to wait on another one of these to come in). Their wiring harness they had for sale has 4 differnet plugs - including the one shown in the picture. If I remembered the brand I would tell you. But be warry of this harness. May NOT fit.
4,"Enjoyable, but somewhat shallow","This album has some really great tracks on it. The opening Sonny Stitt piece, Eternal Triangle, really ""burns"", as the title suggests. But, after the pyrotechnics of Bruno's amazing technique smolders like cinders in a pile of ash(and his technique, if nothing else, is amazing), there isn't a lot to this album. It is a completely listenable and enjoyable piece, but it is lacking in that special something that makes a legendary jazz work of art. Maybe it's the chemistry between the players, which is a bit stale at times, or maybe it is the solos, which can be a bit by the numbers, but this album can only be ""good"", not ""great."""
2,No difference,I can't see any difference in me taking tea versus not taking. Maybe dosage needs to be specified to see effects
2,Imperfect.,"What a disappointment this video is. It is apparently the exact content of the syndicated television program that spawned it with no additional footage or information included. Much of the screen time is taken up by Lauren Hutton's introduction and closing comments, leaving about 15 minutes total time to view Paris. The recommendations for spending one's three ""perfect days"" are definitely geared toward the upmarket audience (e.g., stay at the Hotel Ritz, take taxis everywhere,etc.), with no particular insider's advice about such important things as how long one can expect to spend on each recommended visit or the cost (or practicality) of any recommended activity. I wish I had saved my money to spend in Paris! That said, the photography was beautiful, although we receive only the briefest glimpses of the wonders or Paris."
4,For more of THE STORY.....,"I will cut to the chase here....if you like this album,then please go and find the band THE STORY who are Martin Welham and his son making new albums up to the standard set by Forest but recently recorded! ""Tale Spin"" is their title highest in my recommendation,but ""Arcane Rising"" is very cool too,...and if you are spellbound by Forest,you surely need these albums too."
2,Form factor is off,"I wanted a mogul base CFD and this is the only offering I found. However... Like many CFDs, the electronics enclosure immediately above the screw base is substantially larger in diameter than the shank of the equivalent incandescent bulb and won't fit in the fixture that it was to go into. This is an antique lamp and so I'm approaching raising the socket in the fixture with a great deal of care."
5,Great product.,"Great product. Makes pulling hair from the ear easier on your furry friend. Also, smells good and helps keep ears clean."
4,A funny bunny vampire book!,"This book is a very good book. My teacher read it to me and I think that Chester the cat reads too much mystery books. I thought Harold was the smartest even though he thought Bunnicula was a vampire for a little while. I liked this book because it was very funny. You should read it, it's cool! (Joie Converse age 8"
5,Jackpot once again!,"I absolutely love the Gear's style of writing. They make you feel as if you are right there with the characters. I can see and hear them as I am reading. I have read all of their other novels and can say that this is my favorite series of them all. I anxiously look forward to the next one. Who knows, maybe we'll see Dusty's mom again! If you have never read a book by the Gears be sure to start with the very first novel in this series. Once you meet Dusty and his eclectic group of friends you'll never look back. Enjoy!!"
5,AWESOME SONGS!,"I think that between the voice and the carefully chosen words for his songs, Marc Anthony is a young talented salsa singer with the ""soneo"" style from the old school....if you like ""old school salsa "", it is very romantic and very clean music....He is great!"
5,Magical,"I loved this book! It was just so magical. Its about a girl named Emily who is new in Stonehill,Pennsylvania and has no friends. One day she is at her mother's vet hospital when she hears a terrible scream, it comes from a cat who is wounded very badly. The person who brought the cat in is a girl about Emily's age. I won't tell you any more but the rest of the book leads you into a world filled with magic and adventure. This was a great book!"
5,I LuV iT,In this story there are 3 girls and each has magic in her and has to us there magic to save a wild life preserve and help magical animals that live in the perverse too. This book was so good I cant wait to read the next one a read other peoples review and they like Adriane but I like Emily and Kara...
5,Well weighted,"For all of you conductors out there who like the weight of wood but don't like a heavy baton, this product if for you. It is weighted to balance on your hand. It is not bulky or delicate, but just right."
3,A complex book - not for the beginner,"This book covers a lot of ground, beginning with photosynthesis, plant-water relations, and plant energy balances before discussing ecological aspects of plant physiology. While it follows a logical progression from the cell to the ecosystem scale, the book is very difficult to read. The authors try to cover too much material in the book, omitting basic material in order to broaden the focus of the book. Therefore, it is definitely not for those who are looking for a basic book in either plant physiology or plant ecology. As a textbook, it is difficult for undergraduate students to understand, and seems to be geared towards graduate students and those already familiar with the field."
1,beware,"first of all, you must buy contact glue(doesnt come with kit,it should for fifty bucks), then you have to make sure it fits your bike,(it doesnt fit most models), then you have to have a dog that weights less than 10 lbs,(my dog broke the cheap plastic snap and plastic (link) and caused a major accident). i suggest that if you buy this, buy a metal snap and a metal chain link, then it might work. i could basically make a better version for cheaper if i had a full picture.......rip off"
2,Doesn't fit smaller bikes,I bought this and was really excited about letting my dog run with me when I rode. I have two bikes...A mountain bike and a road bike...and sadly it didn't fit either. There is not room to mount it on a smaller bike...so don't order if you aren't sure.
4,"Better then Kiwi, but not a miracle polish","I bought this polish to try to get a better shine then using Kiwi polish. I have been using Kiwi polish for years, but wanted a nicer shine without the work. I hate spit shining boots. I can say that after a few polishes the Lincoln wax gave me a deeper shine, but nothing amazing. I will still have to spit shine if I want the high gloss (which isn't happening so I don't know if that is easier). If the leather seems to hold up as well with this wax as with the Kiwi I will stick to it. If not I will switch back as treatment and preservation of the leather is more important then the shine."
5,Extremely Accurate,The tabs are great. Fingerings make sense. A no brainer if you want to get some insight to the writing of John and the boys.
5,Stomp + Sesame Street = GREAT STUFF for little ones,"The cast of Stomp visits Sesame Street in this fantastic DVD.In the usual Sesame Street style, there is a general plot line (Telly loses his Tuba) intertwined with short bits and cartoons all related to making music. The Stomp cast crosses in and out of the plot, making music with brooms, cans, boxes of Tic Tacs, etc. Very creative and very charming.My 14-month-old loves this video. He's just starting to try to make ""music"" along with the video, usually using an oatmeal box or pots and pans that I put nearby for him to use.Great stuff, including the ""Pinball"" cartoon (counting to 12) that I loved to watch when I was little."
1,"Awful, Huge sesame street fans disappointed","I thought this would be great. Me and my daughter love everything sesame street but neither one of us liked this video. My daughter is 15 months and with Kids Favorite Songs, Do the Alphabet and Elmo's Guessing Game my daughter is glued to the TV. But this video was so disappointing. It is really not interesting to watch. It is an adult concept that doesn't translate well to a kid audience. Good in theory but not on video. Stick with the three listed above and you can't go wrong."
3,Good pocket resource,"The book seems jam packed with information and reference material for rigging. only downside is the pages aren't laminated, only the covers (soft covers, pocket size book). Living in a humid place like New Orleans with tropical downpours happening every day in the summer time, a fully laminated booklet would be better."
4,A Great Little Book,"This is a nice little bit of philosophy. The author brings together a number of ideas from other sources, basically premised on the law of attraction. But, he also discusses ""generativity"" or enjoying life in your later years.The wording is a bit complex, suited for a scientific/engineering mind, but is not complex in vocabulary just phrasing. The way thoughts are organized make it less accessible to non-detail oriented people. But, the way thoughts are organized also allows for clarifying very complicated ideas in ways that come across as deeply profound.It's definitely worth reading. If you are a follower of the law of attraction, and Eastern Thought (but of Western Heritage), his points are useful (not to give up ALL control of your life to other forces). He advocates a balanced approach of contemplation and action. Well done, clear and insightful."
1,"TRIPE, PURE AND SIMPLE","Calling this movie terrible is an understatement. Who the heck is Robbie Benson? Judging by this movie, in which he stars, co writes, co produces and composes it's all too obvious why you haven't heard of him. The 'barber shop' folk song at the beginning will have you ejecting your lunch, you almost wish Jason Voorhees would show up and hack him to pieces. I've seen a lot of lousy movies in my time. This ranks as one of the worst."
2,half (2) r just ok...,"...venus and they... r the pix for this set but both need way more action where venus needs some monsters--come on man, wow....."
4,Great for children of WWII soldiers!,"I am biased, being Marvin's son. However, not only did I gain a great understanding of what happened to the ordinary soldier during the war, but I found a gap filled in the history books. Most of the time, 'history' books are told from the point of view of national strategy and of the leaders thereof. Although important, they do not tell the true human story. I've loaned this book to a number of friends of my generation, and all of them returned it with glowing praise. They say they finally understood what dad (or uncle or...) went through during the war and had a new-found appreciation of that involvement. Recommended."
5,Elmer lives,"In my opinion, ELMER GANTRY is Sinclair Lewis' finest novel, and that's saying a lot. I first read it some years ago during the height of the televangelist scandals, and while the vernacular seemed a bit quaint, the story itself was as fresh as the daily headlines--so topical that for a while there I regarded Lewis as something of a prophet. He wasn't of course. His novel is set in the early decades of the 20th century, and the fact that it seems so current today is testimony not to Lewis' prescience, but to the persistence of the religious milieu in which real-life Elmer Ganrys thrive. Lewis had obviously researched his subject extremely well, for he was almost uncannily familiar with the dim-witted but canny types who fill pews and collection plates by telling people what they want to hear."
3,A HYPOCRITICAL PREACHER,"Elmer Gantry starts off brilliantly, worthy of 6 stars then goes down hill from there.Sinclair Lewis tells of the bad side of the church back in the 20th century through Elmer Gantry's ministry.I don't mind anything being made fun of, if it can be told interestingly.This story is not interesting. I struggled to finish but with the high ratings I was curious to find out why it rated so highly so I had to finish it. I do not recommend this book, save your money."
4,"Pleasant, light summer reading....","I suppose my major reservation about STONEBROOK COTTAGE is that it's best read after the others in this New England-Texas series; it would stand as a good story on its own, but as usual there are all these characters hanging around from earlier books.I enjoyed the characters - the children rang true, and it's always fun to 'catch up' on characters from earlier books. The secondary love story between the new governor and a local farmer has a nice, different twist. The hero was very much the alpha male of women's popular fiction intent on getting his own way, but since Neggers counters this with an equally strong heroine equally intent on getting her own way, it works.It's light summer reading; not the best book I've read this summer, but far from the worst. I haven't yet decided if it will go into the keeper pile."
1,More like Ex-STINK-shun #nailedit,"Eh I can see how some people could dig this but it really didn't sit with me. I told a pal I was into Central European/German lit but had steered clear of TB and she directed me to this. While I often enjoy that long-monologue style of novel, the main character was not engaging. Plain as that. Note I am not saying I didn't like the book because I didn't like or relate to the character, but that his manifestation was boring."
5,elmos does it again,my 1 year old grandduaghter twins love elmo...and especially this oe...having trouble feeding...slip the dvd in watch them smile and chow down.....its a must have
4,love elmo,"I purchased this video for circle time with my ABA group. I like the video, but would skip parts with Mr. Noodle so that kids don't get confused as to how to put on jacket, hat or shoes. They love elmo though!"
2,An ok book only because there are few others on the subject.,"Astral Combat is a book on fighting dark entities in the astral realms. In fact, it is one of the few books other than Stuart Wilde's e-book, Gods Gladiators, that covers the subject.There is way more theory than practice presented in the book, but anyone with at least a little knowledge of the astral will be able to put the information to practical use.One of the book's weakness is that there no teaching of the spirit, only a teaching of a mortal soul (astral body) and mortal physical body. Thus it can be a very grim book at times. However, many astral travelers report that there is indeed an spiritual component to humankind, and this should be born in mind by any reader.There is also a tendency on the authors part to present his views as the ONLY correct reality, no exceptions. For those who have had actual experience in the astral, it is clear that there is a greater truth than presented in this book."
1,D-Link? How about J-unk?,"Where do I start? The fact that you have to set an IP on your home network to work with this thing that then will not allow you to communicate with the Internet? Or the fact that this thing supports about 4 printers?The manual which tells you how to set it up in XP and gives you instructions, but in fact the screen shots they show look nothing like XP? Once I got this...maybe I am missing something...ok, so I can print wirelessly as long as I have this thing permanently tethered to my router with a cable? Great as long as my router and printer sit right next to each other, but if you are like me and thought ""ok..I hook this wireless thing up to my printer and off to the races"" you will be very disappointed. Why was this thing even made? Mine is going right into the trash..would not even give this monkey paw to a thrift store because I would not want to curse someone else with it."
1,This is a total POS,"This is total garbage.Out of the box it says 802.11g compatible, but NO! It only does WEP. And then when you try to set it to Infrastructure mode, goodbye MAC address! Check for revised firmware, and the D-Link web site shows the latest is OLDER than what is installed!My gosh, who do they think they're fooling? Based on this experience, I don't think I'll buy any D-Link product--ever."
3,"Looks like fun, but those of us with 2 left feet can't follow along","I've watched both DVD's several times and it looks like so much fun that I want to join in, but my two left feet just can't seem to get with the program no matter how hard I try. Tamilee goes over the moves again and again, but I just can't seem to pick it up. This one just isn't for those of us who are severely choreography challenged. Guess I'll just have to keep marching in place and doing knee lifts with Leslie Sansone."
2,"comfortable and warm, but defective","The stitching pulled out of the upper toe seam near the bow after less than 3 hours of wear around the house, on carpet.Which is too bad, because they were comfortable and warm. Just not, apparently, well made."
3,NICE ANN COMFY BUT STITCHING CAME UNDONE,THEY ARE REALLY COMFY AS SOON AS I PUT THEM ON. KEEP MY FEET NICE AND WARM. BUT AFTER TWO DAYS THE OUTSIDE STITCHING CAME UNDON AROUND THE OUTER EDGE OF THE FRONT OF THE SHOE. FIXED IT BEST I COULD. TO MUCH OF HASTLE TO RETURN.
2,What they said...,"I have to agree with the last two reviewers - these slippers fell apart much too quickly. This was very sad for me, as they were so incredibly comfortable."
5,THEY AIN'T RAPPERS THEY GAME SPITTERS,THIS CD IS HELLA TIGHT. MANNY FRESH IS JUST DOING HIS ORDINARY THANG BY COMIN WIT THEM FUNKY BEATS WHILE BABY AND THA HOTBOYS JUST STRAIGHT PUT IT DOWN. THESE BOYS NO THEY CAN'T RAP BUT THEY STILL BE PUTTIN IT DOWN LIKE ONLY CASH MONEY CAN PUT IT DOWN. MY LAST WORDS ARE JUST GO GET DA ALBUM CAUSE U GOTTA LUV DEM NIGGAZ
4,old cash money!,"this album is very good for an early release.i have this one UNOPENED 4 SALE on casette tape ,but have many other old out of print cash money albums on cd 4 sale.email if interested."
1,Terrible,"The fact that someone actually paid money on this CD and listens to it is proof of how uneducated children are in the US.If anyone over the age of 12 owns this CD, they don't deserve to have hearing."
4,"Scary, exciting, thought-provoking","Very interesting introduction to the topic of nuclear smuggling, and the dangerous deterioration of the military in the former Soviet Union. We in the military often spoke of the USSR as ""a Third-World nation, but with nukes"". That assessment is more true than ever, according to the authors. Grinding poverty, crime - both petty and organized - and an undisciplined, unreliable military. Bad as Russia now is, we really, really want it to stay the only nuclear Third-World nation (OK, except India). The authors' depiction of internal US politics and agency wrangling over nuclear terrorism is depressing. Read this book after seeing Cockburn's movie ""The Peacemaker"", and you can put an actor's face to many of the real characters."
4,A very witty.......,.....exciting fun movie. It's light in its' theme and total story-line. As usual for back then it has a happy ending. Give it a shot!!!!
3,handle comes off,"The tamper is nice and heavy. however, the handle is screwed on and comes loose easily. It should probably be secured with some glue."
5,Tamper,"This replacement tamper does the job! Both stylish & handsome, it has a very hefty weight, and with its polished bottom, retains no grounds after tamping. The only caveat is that the wood handle does turn somewhat and the metal threads may ""chew"" and loosen over time; but this has not been the case so far."
4,These are great,"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these bottles. They were purchased to store my essential oil blends and I could not be happier with the sturdy ease of use the bottles offer. Great product, you won't be disappointed."
4,3 WONDERFUL EPISODES,"Night Gallery. Used to watch these with my grandmother. As a kid, they seem so scary. Now they are not necessarly scary, but just plain entertaining. I am usually not one to purchase just a few episodes, but I really wanted to see this. When the individual seasons are less costly, I will purchase."
2,VHS tape a bit noisy,"I recalled being really scared watching this as a kid, so I purchased this tape. I still have a vcr/dvd combo unit, but it's a Phillips brand and not the best quality player. My good hi-fi unit got crushed in a move, and the ones you find at Goodwill are usually damaged in some way. So I guess I'm stuck.I only watched the first episode, and it started out with quite a bit of noise in the audio. It mostly cleared up after the first few minutes. Not sure if Season 1 on DVD has these 3 pilot episodes. For the money, I guess it was an OK purchase."
1,Broken every time,This is the second Tureen I have ordered from this company that is broken. I will be returning it for the second time now and looking for somewhere else to purchase one.
3,very curious about.....,i want to get some info about the guy in freestyler (the b_boy )if any of u have some i will be very grateful to get em
1,First impressions count,"The EC-Council calls itself a professional organization, but the horrendous grammatical and punctuation errors contained in this book cast serious doubt upon that claim. I found myself wondering if English is the first language of the author(s). Even the printing is awful, as on every page words are interrupted by empty ""spa ce."" I can't even address the content--I got a headache just trying to get the sentences to make sense, and finally had to give up. If so little attention is given to the presentation of the facts, how much confidence can I have that the facts themselves are correct?"
1,Save your money and buy gas instead,"six videos, twelve minutes and absolutely nothing enjoyable about this disc. If you've got money to throw away this is a perfect vehicle for that. This clearly proves that fast does not equal great or even talented for that matter. Save your money and buy a gallon of gasoline instead, it will take you further than this DVD ever does."
3,Good But Could Have Been Better,you really have to love the great kat to watch this and like it i enjoyed this the only problem i had was its about 15 to 20 min long but if you are new to the great kat dont hurry and buy this listen to some of her music and watch some videos on youtube first
5,Faster than Death,"To Metal FansGrind Core is Fast , Death is Fast . Some Bands Like ""Morbid Angel"" incorperate Paganini riffing in the Rhythm GTR range .Kat plays actual Classical pieces At Death and Grind Speed . Rhythm GTR work is ripping . Drums doing Blastbeats . Some pieces will fit in perfectly in a Death grind Compilation"
2,I guess antichrist is his only good cut...,"I saw antichrist first (yeah, I know, boo hiss.), and was frankly blown away by the juxtaposition of the jittery handheld approach with the painfully slow and beautiful shots. Plus the story was great, suspense well paced, and von trier wasn't afraid to 'go there' and beyond.So, I considered von trier a great director. I bought europa thinking it would be amazing and it was this pretentious piece of garbage. The constant color on black and white and overlapping frames came off as trying too hard. ""Look! I'm an artist!"" Sad.Hopefully, von trier's sci-fi movie will be as good as, or better than, antichrist. Maybe its just his older films. Who knows. But don't buy this. Shame shame criterion."
5,SUPERFAST,"i DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID'T BUT THIS BUY WAS FASTER THEN THE LIGHT.VERY EFFICIENT , CONGRATULATIONS GUY'S"
1,Watch Out.......Won't play in Region 1 (USA),"After buying over 600 movies in recent years this is the first time i got burned on a Region 2 Movie. Somehow i got fooled! Lesson learned, read the small print and watch who you buy from."
2,"Great content, sloppy editing","I was really disappointed with this book. The content itself is great - Dabney is insightful and memorable.However, the editing in this book is truly awful. There are only 36 pages of text, and I found 41 editing problems. Some were minor - a typo here and there. Others were pretty egregious - editing marks that were left in the manuscript when Vision Forum published it. For instance, on page 25, you read ""Parental love is the main bond ((or)) (should be ""of???)) human society..."" - it is clear the editor in this case just didn't finish his job.I am a big fan of Vision Forum's material, having ordered quite a bit from them and intend to continue to do so. But the quality of this book was just not up to snuff."
4,Bebob LANC Zoom control,Build quality is great and I like the Pro feeling it delivers. Being able to adjust the speed with a separate wheel in combination with the pressure sensitiveness is a plus as well. I use it together with a Canon XF105 on a Miller tripod and the way it sits and how you can operate it when mounted on the arm is great.
3,It's aight,"This is a aight cd. But it's not better Than Thuggin N Pluggin""1995"". I like ""True to the game"" and ""Hoes I used to sweat featB-32 aka Baby"" i gave it a 3 cuz it only has 6 songs. But it's a good cd."
1,"""Pure Sweat,"" puh-leeze","Not only did I not sweat, but my heart beat didn't raise any. I will grant that I work out a lot.This is probably a good workout if you're really out of shape. A total beginner might get a workout, but if your already work out regularly, keep your money and invest elsewhere. The Cardio Shimmy from the same series is actually pretty good.Also, the music is indescribably awful."
2,Plastic and Stuffy.,"That's the feeling I get from watching this video!! The instructor is so stiff and looks like she is trying so hard to look pretty, happy and to actually do the moves properly that it just makes you feel tense watching it. I just didn't feel like these were traditional belly dancers. I feel like this was someone that is fit, and is just sort of going through the motions of the moves!! The Veena and Neena videos are so much better because they are more relaxed and really look like they know what they are doing."
5,The Spirit Of Philadelphia Vol2.,Anyone who loves 70's Philly Soul will love this. Lots of good oddball stuff from familiar names as well as some unfamiliar ones. I'm from Philly and I never heard of some of this stuff. But it's good. Real good. I hope there are move volumes to come.
2,Songs in the CD were very difficult to understand,"I came across this set in our local library and as a native mandarin speaker, I was very excited to play this for my kids. Upon listening to it, it was very disappointing as the words they were singing were very difficult to hear or understand. We couldn't understand what they were trying to say. This book has good intentions and a great idea, too bad it teaches kids wrong word tonations."
4,Creole Folktales,Creole Folktales is fantastic! His use of language creates an atmosphere that is alive with beautiful images. The underlying meanings of each story (12) are so powerful. When you read it you won't be able to put it down and when you're finished you'll never forget them!
5,Clearer Vision of a Loving God,"James took me on a self journey through his experiences. The end result is that I want to love the hurting...and ""Love the sinner""...and skip the second part of hate the sin. That is God's part. This was truly a life changing book for me. Thank you James for sharing your intimate beliefs."
3,helmit,"Since I have a big head, I ordered a large size, which was too big.I needed a medium. Returning the helmit was easy but I was upset that I had to pay for shipping.Refund was quick"
3,tractor cake pan,"I was totally unaware that the cake pan ordered was plastic, until it arrived. It did, to my surprise perform well in baking the cake in an electric oven at 350 degrees. The cake baked evenly and in the usual time. I would not have bought it if I had known it was plastic because of concerns about the chemicals that are released by plastic products when heated to certain temperatures."
3,Its ok for a simulator game,I am not much of a simulator fan of games. I bought it more becasue i am a trek fan and play several of thier computer games. Activision company gmaes I tried on the computer I liked so went with this. Have not really played it enough since i found out it was more of a simulator than strategy simulator like Starfleet command series games. More computer efficient than playstation efficient in gaming knowledge. I play it on my Playstation 2 and still trying to figure out hte controls (tells you how much I dont play the game :P)
5,Good for those who only recently arrived to the United States,"...and also for those who have at least advanced or intermediate skill in English language. In my case I bought this book hoping to enrich my general conversational vocabulary. I have NOT achieved my personal goal since the book is full of most simple phrases that are very quickly learned from daily communication by anyone who lived in the US for more than 2 months (Thanks! Sorry 'bout that! See you! How you've been? and similar.)However, I found this book to be particularly helpful in terms of idioms and expressions that are otherwise not clear to a non-native English speaker even in context (drop the ball, gone out the window, let's touch base tomorrow, and similar phrases.)I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is new to the country and needs to master the American slang and daily communication."
1,Common American Phrases in Everyday Contexts: A Detailed Guide to Real-Life Conversation and Small Talk (Mcgraw-Hill Esl Referen,"I don't like this book.It doesn't help for ESL guys, myself.If you want to learn phrases, I would like to suggest you to learn ISBN-10: 0764127764; Handbook of Commonly Used American Idioms,Adam Makkai,(Author). Pocket size. Can bring along with you wherever you go that Barron's Educational Series.Don't buy this Mcgraw-Hill book."
3,everything is great but nothin challenging!!!,id say everything is great but the levels only have 5 challenges if you want a really good challenging game get tony hawk 2 or tony hawk 3.But if you are one of those who do not like challenging games this game is for you.
5,mat hoffman rocks,I hate how everybody is saying stuff about how it was late and stuff. It was only late because of how the game played on the demo. When you landed it would make you crash if you landed perfect but they reconfigured it so it played smoother alot like tony hawk. This and fixing a few gliches i am glad they wated for it to come out so now it is as smooth as ButterBMX RULES
1,she needs to get vocals,sorry to say it(well not really) but this girl cant sing where is the talent?i dont see it anywhere she only had one hit and where is she now?someone should take her and paulina rubio and seal their mouths shut cause neither of them has any class or for that matter talent
3,size label is deceiving,"I'm not sure why they would be different, but they were. I purchased two 3-packs of size 12 cotton briefs, just as I had before. (Although each had been from different locations, and even from actual stores). Everything about these panties appeared to be similar, until I wore a pair. The fabric and elastic openings for both legs/thighs were quite tight and uncomfortable. I thought it was just me, but then I compared several pairs (from this purchase, and from others) side-by-side. There was my answer. Whoever made these panties used less elastic and didn't gather the fabric enough to create a comfortable opening for my legs/thighs. Lesson learned. I will have to purchase my panties from a store, so I can be sure I can return them if the fit is not right. In this case ""Just My Size"" just isn't. Elizabeth M., Staten Island"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A woman leaves a low tech spaceship to go into space to reclaim some valuables, not understanding the whole time dilation thing.When she gets back, old age has done in the relatives. She meets a man named Rocannon, a human, and this odd planet with different races erupts into conflict.They, of course, decide they like each other."
3,<< nice dark and dirty vibe >>,The Peace Division Remix is the best. The others are ok. I include this song into my sets. If u r looking for a song that will get the crowd in the groove... this is your song. If you are looking for a crowd pumping anthem... head elsewhere. Look for other Peace Division remixes.. they put out quality tracks. ~peace
3,"A really good book, not great.","I really enjoyed the book and left it feeling good about it and wanting to read the rest in the series. However, there were pages I skimmed through full of superfluous descriptions of air and dirt (to me). I had the sense the author was pandering to a minority audience to sell books. But overall I liked it. I much preferred Hambly's two vampire novels, and Dragonsbane/Dragonshadow. But I must admit when I'm done with Steven Saylor's Roman mystery series and Candace Robb's Owen Archer series, I'll return to Hambly's Benjamin January series."
5,Worth re-reading,"I originally purchased this book several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it and all of the later January books. I came by Amazon to re-buy the book as I loaned it out and lost track of it, only to find myself caught up in the reviews. I am truly amazed by the number of people who complained about the lengthy descriptions, number of characters and overall 'wordiness' of the book. Really? This is a novel, people, not a movie. I feel like Mozart in ""Amadeus"", "" ... too many notes?"" I think Hambly used exactly as many words as she needed."
5,Unbelievably good!,"I can't understand how anyone can ""get lost"" in the book. I had no trouble keeping up with everything and everyone, and agree with the reviewer who said she sometimes went back to reread a passage. Too many details? Hah. I wouldn't trust anyone who said so to have ever read any history. A magical time travel, a marvelously colorful panorama, that's what this book is. Read it, by all means."
4,storyline,"was recommanded this book, having recently moved to Louisiana myself ,It is interesting to read a story taking place in Nola(New Orleans-Louisiana)....good style, good description of the 19th C..."
4,Great book,"This book is great fun and full of fascinating little details. It covers the process of mummification and interesting info about the history of Egyptology. I loved the stories about the archaeological finds at Saqqara and Deir el Bahri. My one complaint is the last chapter, which is a lame summary of mummies in modern fiction."
5,An intimate insight,"This book was introduced to me through a friend and, quite frankly, my first reaction was to cringe at the idea of reading such a bulky historical book. But from the first letter I was transfixed by the dialogue between husband and wife on both political and personal matters. This book brings with it a new aspect of Churchill's personality - he was not only a great statesman but he was a passionate man who loved his wife dearly which is seen clearly in the letters that were intended for her eyes only.I often wonder how he would have felt to know millions would one day read the letters he wrote to his ""clemmie-cat"". In any case, its a great read :)Cheers, Meagan."
4,Facinating look into the private life of a great statesman,"The real service that this book performs is to remind the reader that great historical figures are not one dimensional. Chuchill was a renaissance man, warrior, journalist, historian, memoirist, politician and statesman. He was arguably the single greatest personage of this century and his name has become a symbol for the indominitable spirit of a free people. The collection of letters sent to and received from his wife are entertaining as well as educational. They provide a feel for the time in which they were written and place many of Churchill's famous accomplishments (and failures) in proper context. Amazingly, unlike today when the more we know of a public figure, the smaller they seem, in Churchill's case one comes away convinced that this was a great man in the truest sense, and that much of his greatness is due in no small part to his marriage to Clementine."
1,Gets old after a few hours,"I bought this game after hearing everyone say how great it is. I have previously been burned after going for games, movies, etc that everyone said was excellent. I dunno, maybe I have very high expectations when everyone builds something up? anywho, this game is a disappointment. The tricks are fun to do for the first couple of hours or so, but it gets old real quick, plus the difficulty of accomplishing the missions objectives is, in my opinion, needlessly difficult.I got this game for Christmas and I've stopped playing it already (today's 12/27/2001). Waste of $20..."
3,Classic but Dated,"Classic game with a lot of nastalgia if your a long time gamer. Great fun, but it gets old pretty quickly."
5,AWESOME!,"I first played this at my friend's house, and I LOVED IT! It's full of cool moves, and interesting modes, like HORSE. I've never played the first Tony Hawk game, so I can't compare it to this one. ...Three words: BUY THIS TODAY! I ask nothing more."
5,No More Rejections - No more worries,This is a great how to book for writers who are seriously wanting their work published. I am learning so much from this author's expertise.
1,They should've called it...,"Simba's Mighty Flop. I have the GameBoy version, and believe me it is not much. Only 10 levels, 4 bonus games that I don't even like, and annoying music. All you do is run around, get stars, jump on enemies, and that's it. The only attacks you get are scratch, roar, and jump. The way you get through level 1 is to jump on Zawzhu, the little bird. Definately disappointing."
2,Boring,"I searched high and low in many rental stores for this and finally found it through a friend of my roomate in college. Of course I love the soundtrack for this, which is why I wanted to see the movie, but I wasn't going to buy it. I realize after I watched it why it was so difficult to find. If it wasn't for Pink Floyd, this movie would not be back for sale. But, in my opinion, its really boring and the only cool part about it is the music that sounds better on the album anyway."
1,Boooooooooooooring!,"I LOVE pink floyd so I picked up this movie. Didn't know what to expect, but what I got wasn't it. What a boring movie. Save your money."
1,Censored DVD,I bought this video thinking it would be a complete unedited version. i was wrong its the same as the vhs version i also purchased from amazon.com. drug references are edited out and so are partial scenes. do not buy this video from amazon in vhs or dvd.i was fortunate to have rented an uncensored vhs copy from tower records a few years ago. now im stuck with two crap copies. i wish amazon had forewarned me before purchase.i will no longer buy from amazon.
4,"More, snapshot of the 60's","Continuing my fascination with European films of the 60's, I watched Barbet Schoeder's ""More"" (1969) last night. Starring Mimsy Farmer and featuring a classic soundtrack by Pink Floyd, the film is one part Icarus myth, one part sixties ""free love"" sexploitation film, and one part cautionary drug tale. Filmed mostly on the island of Ibiza, the cinematographer was Nestor Almendros, who would later film such classics as ""The Story of Adèle H,"" ""Days of Heaven,"" and ""Sophie's Choice."""
3,Mac users beware - only works on PowerPC macs,"This is a good product and works as advertised - with one small flaw. If you're an Apple Mac user, you'll only be able to use it if you're running a PowerPC Mac. Due to a compilation problem in the VPN client Java library by Netgear, the SSL VPN client will not run on an Intel based Mac (even through Rosetta).If you're planning to use this with an Intel Mac - wait for a firmware upgrade from Netgear otherwise you'll just be staring at a useless blue box with a flashing green light!"
1,Unhappy PIPI FAN!,"I bought this dvd for my five girls for Christmas, extreamly excited and telling them about PIPI for years till I finally came across purchasing this dvd. Who the heck is ANNA first of all? I believe her name was ANIKA! Not to mention the fact that the voice of PIPI, TOMMY AND ANIKA are not like it was when I was growing up! The most important dissappointment to me was the fact that I childishly taught my children PIPI's THEME SONG! Did anyone notice that she didn't sing it in one episone? I'm so bummed. Although they liked it, it just wasn't the same for me. It was like changing a holiday Charlie Brown Episode! Hope and a hay and a hope shaaaana!"
5,Pippi Longstocking -The TV Series Review,My kids have all kinds of computer animated movies but they never get tired of watching Pippy Longstocking and her friends go on wild adventures. Rated G- Fun for the whole family. I used to watched these movies as a kid and still find them entertaining to watch. You can't go wrong with this movie set.
4,Go with the cheaper version,"I bought this version because the dubbing was touted as being superior.The TV series still has its origional charm, my 7 year old loves it.However, the dubbing is still bad.Go with the less expensive version, it can't be much worse and you'll save money.My friends loaned the DVD and loved it...very nostalgic."
4,Printer Hub,We have a new iMac and Dell PC connected to our Canon printer through the device and everything works as expected (or unexpected).
5,Great little USB Switch,This is a great little USB switch. It looks good and doesn't take up much desk space. It is also very easy to use and set up.
4,Belkin F1U200V 4-Port USB Switch,Very good switch. It does exactly what it advertises it will do. I now have my desktop and laptop connected to an HP printer via USB port connection. Press the button on top of the switch and it connects to any one of (up to) 4 devices.
4,"Great Product, Could Use More On Board USB Ports For Peripherals.",The product works as designed and saves me time! A person immediately plugs in a USB Hub to the unit though as there is only one on board USB port. Wish it had a hub built in.
2,bennett,"Not really very good, I guess I am use to hearing Tony when he was younger - he lost his range of sound"
3,this cd is pretty good but different,"I really enjoy this cd. All of those whom has heard me play this cd likes it very much, and are wondering where I got it from. Everyone thinks it's new."
4,Better than the first,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a lot better than the first skateboarding game. The outlay of the skating is done in side scrolling slash three-d graphics. There is a PC interface, too."
3,It was ok................but i think it was too hard!,"I got Tony Hawk 2 for Gameboy on my birthday.It isnt that bad of a game,but it's nothing like the playstation version,on playstation the first level isnt hard like the gameboy version,so i think if you are going to get this game,u will be very disapointed!"
2,Not very impressed,"This product goes on easily and absorbs into the skin immediately, leaving no ""residue"" of any type. However, after using this product for a number of weeks, I have not seen any positive change whatsoever with regards to the under-eye area. I was hoping to improve the fine lines and puffiness but this has not happened! This product is expensive, and really should deliver more than it does."
4,Classic,"Wish it would have had original packaging, but still a great price for decent looking disc. Another stocking stuffer that was a winner!"
5,The Most Addictive Video Game of All Time!,"Tony Hawk 2 is by far one the greatest games to ever grace the Dreamcast lineup of ever improving game selections. This game is not a game. It is a virtual world of incredible skateboarding tricks, and unfathomable stunts even by daredevil standards. For fans of the original Tonk Hawk, this sequel blows it right out of the water, a must have game to add to your dreamcast library with some of the greatest reply value ever seen in a video game. Once you kickflip you can't stop."

1,same,"This is almost exactly one of Franz Bardon's books If you already have his books, do not bother with this one."
4,It's a interesting book,"It's a little hard to understand but when you understand it, it is pretty amazing"
3,SOLID PRINCIPLES WITH SHAKY EXPLANATIONS,"The Principles of the Kybalion are well based. The Three Initiates seem to be adding the explanations to Principles that came from somewhere else and another time. The explanations are a worthy attempt at defining The Hermetic Principles but they leave much to be desired and even steer MIND down the wrong path, further away from it's knowledge. I can understand why they didn't put their names on the book."
4,Helpful,Item helpful in setting up an understanding of calorie counting. I was especially interested in Protein counts. After a few weeks I was able to use it for new unfamiliar items rather than every item I was eating. Some basic common sense advice.
3,iffy,"I bought these glasses for my husband several years ago, my husband is a farmer and these glasses were put through the test of durability, after two years they broke and I ordered another pair, he lost a lens in a couple weeks. I didn't mind ordering another pair, then I realized the price had doubled, Wow. Don't believe that paying over thirty dollars is acceptable for these glasses, shop elsewhere."
4,Small Head,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I have a small head, and find my CliC Readers to be a little too large - but I love them anyway.They are supposed to be adjustable, but since no directions were included, I've not yet figured how to adjust them.I just received them today, and am back at amazon.com to order 2 more pair."
1,Uncomfortable and awkward,"I tried these, because I got tired of losing my glasses. They are too tight on my head, as I can't slide them down my nose as I do normal reading glasses.As I am a nurse I am constantly going from needing to see closely to not and back again. I like wearing my glasses on the tip of my nose, and these did not allow me to do it, therefore I never wear them."
5,Better than prescription,"I bought these for my husband, since he couldn't see any reason for them. He already had prescription ""no-line"" bifocals. I urged him to at least try the readers. Now he uses them all the time. He prefers the readers to his prescription glasses. The readers have a larger magnified area than bifocals. For reading a book to doing crossword puzzles, these are the glasses he reaches for. They are comfortable and always at hand."
2,CliC Adjustable Glasses,"Looked like a great invention - UNFORTUNATELY, glasses are too tight around my head - I do not have a small head but not a large one either-Needless to say, these do not work at all."
5,ILOVE Clics!!!,Clics are the greatest for those of us who have shorter arms now that we are older!!!! I love them; they stay out of my way but are always there when I need them!!!
4,I really like them,"I ordered this pair for work because I kept dropping my other ones on the floor when I bent over. They are taking a little while for me to adjust to them because I always hung my glasses on the front of my shirt and could put them on with one hand, but that's just me. Initially they seemed a little weird but I do like them so much that I just ordered a second pair for home which thrills my husband since it seems to him that I never have my glasses when he wants to show me something."
2,too tight,these things are extremely tight and dont position far enough down my nose. They definatley need a larger version.
4,Clic adjustable reader,"Great sunglassesWithout reflectorLacks its own packagingSold separately and is not availableColors is limitedWrong on each of the color brown, blackAvailable color golden color metal frame onlyI recommend buying a reasonable price"
4,cool glasses,"very cool. convenient to wear. Frames can break. However, I like them so much I recently ordered another pair of glasses"
2,FRONT CONNECT READING GLASSES,"GOOD IDEA, BUT THEY LOOK VERY GEEKY. WHEN THEY CONNECT, THEY ARE TOO TIGHT. OK FOR AROUND THE HOUSE, FISHING ETC., BUT DON'T LET ANYONE SEE YOU WEARING THEM. MAY GET YOU A STARRING ROLE IN THE NEXT ""REVENGE OF THE NERDS"" MOVIE!"
5,good comfort snack,"I love this soup but can not purchase it nearby. Lot's of green and a light refreshing flavor. It's low calorie, low fat, high protein. I sometimes have one for breakfast and it satisfies me until lunch or eat one during those late morning or mid afternoon craving times. A twelve pack gives you 36 servings, perfect! It comes in a nice display box, easy to slide into your cupboard or pantry."
1,Amazon must provide nutrition info and ingredients,790 mg of sodium per serving. What looks like a vegetarian product contains fish. MSG gives me and a lot of people a nasty reaction. I left feedback about including this info but Amazon hasn't responded or taken any action.
5,Delicious Instant Tofu-Spinach Miso Soup,"Convenient to carry in knapsack or purse, this instant soup reconstitues into a truly good quick meal on the go. It would be great at work or between classes at school. I also use it at night to avoid higher calorie temptations."
2,Bummed to discover that this contains fish :(,"I agree with the last reviewer, the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear. I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it, now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that ""powdered bonito"" is powdered fish. It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package, but on amazon it doesn't specify this. So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for me.(I have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago. I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants. Fish & shellfish are not the same as far as allergies, so I do not know why this sometimes happens. It could have been cross-contamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as well....In any case, I make it a point to avoid things like ""powdered fish"" in my food.)"
2,Silverstone case,"Overall the case looks good and is very sturdy. The optical drive ejection cover is a glue on piece. Now come on! For $110 you mean to tell me the company can insert some hinges or something! Another thing that bothered me was the position of some screws. Several screws were very hard to reach especially the screws for the front casing. I had to replace the noisy front fan and believe me, it wasn't easy. If your looking for a good HTPC case, I wouldn't buy this one unless you have plenty of space and don't mind some cheap looking parts."
3,Essential early Johnny Thunders,"The absence of David J. makes the New York Dolls title questionable, but don't turn away from this one. If you are a huge Johnny fan this is a must. He is featured on lead vocals and wrote almost all the material. In ""That's Poison"" you hear the skeleton of ""Subway Train"", and on the track ""We've Been Through This Before"" you can hear the prototype of ""Sad Vacation"". Also the track ""I am Confronted"" is a lost classic that would not have been out of place on the lonely, wasted masterpiece ""So Alone"". On the down side Billy Murcia's drumming is terrible but the energy and Johnny's playing make up for it. If you dig Johnny's lonely side and enjoy lo-fi, don't miss out."
5,Take a Tour of Fantasyland!,"Have you ever wanted to explore a fantasy world? Well, you can by joining a tour that takes people from our world to a totally different world where fantasy is reality. Or is it? A struggling fantasy world supplements its income by offering tours to offworlders, but they have to follow strict guidelines--evil (the Dark Lord) must wear black and live in a ruined town, he must ride a dark steed, enchantresses must be sexy and wear revealing gowns, etc, etc. When Derk is chosen to be this year's Dark Lord, he turns the world upside down as he and his family struggle to meet the standards of the tour without ruining their home, and the results are amusing and chaotic."
5,There is still hope for Rock and Roll!,"Thank heavens for Program the Dead. Saw them live in Chicago, and was blown away. I'm 20 and listen to a lot different music. I'm always on the look out for good rock, which there seems to little of these days. They did a great rendition of the Doors ""Hello, I love you"" They have a very new and and different sound. Think the intelligence of the Muse, the open melody of Incubus, and the raw sound of The Vines. Still reflecting back to some of favorite bands like Iggy and the Stooges and The Cult! They use a lot of apocolyptic imagery, setting dark tones with a poetic flare, about their views on morality and society. It's very sexy and so is the ablum art."
2,"Good sound quality, easy to use...but does not last long.","I'll admit that the sound quality is fantastic. It also blocks out noises, however, they do not last long. I bought me a pair in early October, and took very good care of them. Around early November both ear-buds went out. I am not impressed."
2,very sweet taste,"I love the Honey Stinger Organic Waffles for long workouts. So I assumed that these would be great too and bought a case of the Honey Stinger Gold Gels. I should have read more closely because I did not realize that this is basically a shot of pure honey with some additives. While I like honey on different things, it is way too sweet to me to take straight as an engergy gel. They do work fine once you get them down, but the hard part for me is getting them down at all. I even tried mixing them directly into a water bottle but that tasted like medicine. So I will stick with the GU and Hammer Gels."
3,not the best flavor,"I suggest trying the other flavors. I only got the strawberry and its not very good. However, the calories are there and it does the job very well. I like the honey taste/texture but the strawberry just isn't very good."
1,Spilled Honey,"Honey was spilled in the box, so I had to take out all the gel packs to clean them. I realized the mess after I opened the box; otherwise, I would've returned it."
3,animorphs rocks,"I'm a huge animorphs fan my brother got me hooked and I love it. I wish they made more animorphs stuff. The game is okay better than the gameboy game and board game and not as good as the computer game. It's sound track is great, grafics are okay, but thats all. It can get frustrating. The seens in the beggining and end are amazing to bad there weren't more. It takes about two and a half hours to beat it. I went back and played it again to see if it had replay value. I beat it in an hour. List in ing to the music is fun though. There are only four animals witch sucks and battling stinks. Overall its okay not good not great not horrible. To bad animorphs is'nt around anymore I'd like to see an animorphs game on the PS2's engine well if your a diehard animorphs fan like me pick this up. Animorphs fans buy it it's the one and only animorphs game for the play station."
5,the Skinning Knife by M H Cole,"This is a wonderful book. M H Cole is a masterful illustrator the likes of which are extremely few and far between. Tragically his books are out of print and difficult to find. ""The Skinning Knife"" is still available in good condition and at a very reasonable price. I would encourage any serious knife collector to aquire a copy if at all possible. It chronicles this vital segment of our nations knife history expertly with fondness and respect. M H Cole is a BLADE magazine Hall of Fame member, and desevedly so. This book is a splendid example of his work and not to be passed over. - Paul Granger"
3,It'd be better if there was more Juve,"There are too many features in this album. Manny Fresh put out some good beats and all, but the problem the rest of the Cash Money Millionares cannot rap. Juvenile is a damn good rapper and Lil Wayne is alright, but otherwise BG and the rest of Cash Money's Crew all suck, and i would rather have them not wasting Juve's album time."
4,GET THIS!,THIS IS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS SAYING IT WAS GOOD. I WAS AMAZED BY THIS CD. IT IS WAY BETTER THAN I EXPECTED. THE LYRICS ARE HARD CORE AND THE BEATS ARE OUT-THE-GATE! PEACE!
5,"cds badass, a true cash money classic","Girl that juvenile, you don't know, hes on fire, 17 inch momos, like magic on his tires"
5,YO THIS JUVENILE ALBUM IS COLD EVERYONE GOT TO BUY THIS,"JUVENILE IS THE TIGHTEST ARTIST OUT RIGHT NOW (AND THE OTHER CASH MONEY MILLIONAIRES) EVERYONE NEEDS TO PICK THIS UP, SLIP IN IN YOUR CD THING AND BUMP IT ALL DAY EVERYDAY ALLDAY (WITH THE OTHER CASH MONEY RECORDS CDS)"
2,Mindless Club Music.,"That's about all there is to be said about the CM click. Manny Fresh is an excellent beatsmith, but the CM emcees are sub-par at best. Juvenile and Lil'Wayne have a little flow, but their still pretty mudane, the rest are straight booty. CM is great for parties, clubs, rides, etc. but it's just not good hip hop, and more importantly, it's just not good music."
1,Look.,"I gave it one star so the folk who be hatin' on cash money would notice and read this. Everyone who dislikes Cash Money allways seem to compare them to No Limit, and they down CMR. Like they just can't get it through they're heads that No Limit t not on top anymore. Face it man and don't hate on 400 degreez. I kinda wish they were from another state cause they would be way way bigger than they are now, but like I said, you got those till I die No Limit followers who gone talk about him and change peoples mind. The CD that A-class all the way. Best song...#14(if you got the original)and 16(if you got the remix version) 5 stars!"
1,Garbage!!!! You wack HA!!!!,What is this kid talking about. He is just spitting nonsense over a terrible beat. This album is a senseless album not worth listening to. It comes to this that hip hop needs to revive it's wackness. Juvenile get a second job
3,Not Enough Juvenile!,"I agree with the writer from Canada, Juevenile's got a nice, refreshingly new style of rapping, but his boys (Hot Boys, B.G., and Manny Fresh) do not. Juvenile definitely is not showcased enough on this album. If you can find a maxi-single with just the ""Ha!"" single and the two remixes, don't buy the album because it ain't worth it. The tracks featuring Juvenile's crew are weak at best. Their flow lacks energy and displays no finesse and their rap content is solely about how much money their making now, expensive rides and how every bi*ch is on their jock. Wack! I expected more of Juvenile's ""off-the-porch"" style of flowing but he's obviously following in Master P's footsteps by cross-promoting other rappers in his camp on his album. That was a mistake, his boys can't keep up with him. Also, Jay-Z sounded weak on the second ""Ha!"" remix - his rap style didn't match well with that wicked, fast-paced beat. I would really rate this 2.5 stars."
5,GREAT FOR THE CAR ON TRIPS!,"IT IS THE BEST CD EVER!WITH HITS LIKE ""HA"" ""FOLLOW ME NOW"" AND ""BACK THAT AZZ UP"" IT CANT BE BAD."
1,TOTALLY WACK,I THINK JUVENILE AND CASH MONEY ARE NOTHING BUT COUNTRY BAMMAS TRYING 2 PLAYA-HATE NO LIMIT. NO LIMIT & RAP-A-LOT RULE DA SOUTH. CASH MONEY IS TOTALLY WACK
1,"A Disgrace in the name of ""Music""","Juvenile CAN NOT RAP. The attempt he makes at rapping is saying similar ghetto phrases in MONOTONE. In many instances, he adds ""-ay"" or a ""yeah"" to the end of each sentence so they sound alike. I like hip hop but this is absolutely terrible.Also, never before have lyrics been so meaningless. He raps about girls and money. That's it. The sickening thing is how much money he actually has. Juvenile owns a record company worth over $350,000,000. Meaning he has about half of that in network wealth. There are hundreds of underground hip hop artists with 10 times as much skill and unlimited potential that are sleeping under bridges. Juvenile is the biggest radio-wonderboy of the past decade, and is the most undeserving garbage in the ""music"" industry."
5,YOUR CONCERT IN MEMPHIS WAZ THE BOOM WE WANT U TO COME BACK.,JUVE U THE BOOM ALL OF YA'LL ARE THE BOOMI LOVE YOUR CD AND WHEN YOU DID THAT VIDEO WITH TEAR THE CLUB UP THUGS THAT AS THE BOOMYA'LL DID THAT VIDEO OVER BY OUR SCHOOL PLAYA WHY U HATING THAT WAS TIGHT.YOUR CONCERT WAS THE BOOMYOU GOT IT CRUMP IN MEMPHIS THEN THE AFTER PARTY AT DEMIN AND DIAMONID THAT WAS THE BOOM
1,this cd is not it,"yo this 400 degrees cd by juvenile is stupid man. now if you slow it down, you might like some songs. aight, im out"
1,Terrible camera work,Get your dramamine ready for this concert as the camera zooming in and out and quickly switching from member to member is very disappointing.
2,not funny at all,me and my fam just saw lottery ticket at the dollar movie and im glad i didnt pay full price. this movie tried to succeed but ultimately failed! it isnt funny and the message can get a lil bit confusing. cube is the only reason i'm not gonna give it a complete one star but thats what it really deserves. cmon cube you can do better my dude!
5,Arrived super quick!,This arrived really fast and I was very please! My husband and I love this movie! I could not find it in stores! Will buy from again!
4,Good clean ghetto fun,Its been oh so long since I've watched a good urban comedy movie. And this movie defiantly filled my thirst for the genre. The movie quality is great and the shipping was fast. I will be purchasing more from this seller.
5,Wonderful!,"I recently took this book out on loan from my local libary, but love it so much, I'm going to buy a copy for myself. I am half-Colombian and grew up in New York where South American cuisine, particularly Colombian, was plentiful (from homecooked, family meals to countless restaurants in Queens). I've been living in California for ten years and often long for an authentic sancocho, platanos, arepas, empanadas, aji piques, etc, but have never had any luck. Now, with these recipes and the wonderfully informative glossary of South American ingredients - and where to get them - I can make the meals I love so much myself and discover so many others. I especially enjoyed the brief history of the South American cuisine."
1,"Should Be Titled ""Abuse Your Intellect""","If a collection of essays can be judged by a single essay within the collection, then this book must be awful. I only read one of the essays, but it was enough to make me put the book down forever."
3,I like her style!!,"Just by looking at many of the song titles, it looks as if she has a great appreciation for traditional artists. This CD also contains quite a few of her original's too. A joy to listen to."
5,The best!,"Several months ago, I set out to teach myself German. I did a couple months of searching, going to book stores to actually examine and compare the materials before I spent my money. Out of several English & German dictionaries I looked at, the Bantam New College Dictionary is THE best. It is thorough and comprehensive, easy to use, and priced right too. An excellent resource to help with German language."
1,Item Recieved not as pictured,"Unfortunately, I cannot rate the performance of this item, the Casio NP-20 Lithium Ion rechargeble battery, because that is not what I got. I specifically paid more to get the name brand and was sent a generic battery. I will give the vendor points for responding quickly when I complained and refunding my money. They did not even require me to return the item. So what does that say for its value. However, weeks later, I still do not have a dependable name brand product. So I will start again, but not with this vendor.L.M. Lewis"
4,Casio NP-20 Lithium Rechargeable Battery-Good Product/Bad Delivery,Very disappointed on the delivery of this item! We had to pay shipping twice to finally receive product!
2,watch out buying batteries,I have one of those dreaded casio batteries. I bought a clone it took about an hour to get the clone battery out of the camera. I tried the connection of batteries to the casio battery and it worked like a charm. If you got a flasher that is a good fix
5,High Quality Seller,The battery arrived in a timely fashion and was brand new fully sealed as promised. Quality seller!
4,so far so good,"The battery that was replaced lasted less than a year, as far as holding a charge it was average."
2,I don't think so...,"Are you kidding me? Over $100 for this?The whole camera outfit is only a few dollars more.2 Generics for $8 worked for me.Also, batteries on my older Casio lasted forever, and was able to take more pics per charge."
4,So far....so good.,"Yes, I received an original OEM battery and so far it has worked well. I am cautiosly optimistic that it will last longer than the original that came with my camera. I'm hoping it too doesn't succumb to the blinking red light of death."
4,Valid critiques of Christianity from atheism's pillars,"This book is unique in that it is written by a Christian who uses the arguments of Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx to critique some of the shortcomings Christianity has shown over the last 2000 years. Its important to know that the author (Westphal) is strongly committed to the truthfulness of Christianity, but he wants other believers to know that we can learn something by listening to the words of these men. While many may ignore such advice when considering the source, I believe Westphal makes a lot of valid points in this book. He likens the critiques of Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx to those of the Old Testament prophets and Jesus. However, Westphal is careful not to blindly accept every criticism which comes from these men. He listens to what they have to say and then acknowledges when they're on the mark. Christians today could learn much by doing likewise."
1,Only writing this because it contains one of the worst songs,"'Planes'Saw the video for it this morning on VH1 Classic and lemme tell ya, I've heard the single worst song in the entire rock canon. Worse, even, than any Barenaked Ladies song. It's just an embarrassment.Lyrics:""I like plaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanes... Jet airplanes!""""I like plaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanes... Experimental aircraft!""""I like plaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanes... Jet airplanes!""Really. That's the gist of it. Maybe the rest of the record is stellar, but they chose this song as their single which leads me to presume that maybe, just maybe, it was their best effort at this point."
2,Don't waste your money,"This was a complete waste for me. I bought it to make ground garlic for a garlic, cheese champagne bread and for pesto. The surface is too smooth and the pestle not rough enough to grind anything (especially raw garlic, pine nuts and peppercorns)It works great on celtic sea salt (powdered salt is tasty on popcorn and fries, try it).I think the cheaper granite mortars would be a better buy and I'm wishing I picked one up at the Carniceria in Tucson for $8, such a deal, huh?Anyway, I am surprised that so many people loved this product, I really can't imagine what they are using it for. Mine is purely decorative, I use it to hold kitchen odds and ends mostly.Save your money folks, check out the ethnic grocery stores, I've seen mortar and pestles at the indian grocery too."
5,Nice addition to the kitchen!,"How did I live without this? Nice compact size takes up very little room in my cabinet, but is sufficient for the surprisingly frequent uses I have had for it. Good addition to any kitchen."
3,"Good, but would probably look around for something better","Pros:Works as desiredCons:Has a tendency to breakPrice has shot up in the last year or soOther thoughts:I bought this as a replacement for the set that my roommate had. He'd bought it for less than $10 in 2010; I had to pay $18 for this in 2012.Also, this can break fairly easily if mishandled (as I learnt from experience). There are better sets out there that you should consider.Finally, I find the name Cordon Bleu associated with this to be faintly ridiculous."
5,"Glorious war, Hideous war","Afraid he might miss GLORIOUS war, Reuben silently escapes from Pa's farm to join the Texas Cavalry. Through four years of the American Civial War Reuben and his fellow soldiers suffer HIDEOUS war without adequate food, clothing, and arms. Often led by fools, they fought heat, cold, measles, dysentery, and Indians, yet they never waver in their courage and dedication. Many of the men of the Ninth Texas Cavalry had lived in Texas only a few months, at most a couple of years - yet Texas Pride permeates the story. Meticulously researched, Ms Crabb has used letters and diaries written by the men of the Ninth to tell the story. All Afire to Fight reads like a modern best selling thriller. It is filled with action, pathos, and undiluted horror as told by the men who did the fighting."
5,Not Just For Texans,"I am a ""California Yankee"" whose favorite view of Texas has usually been through the rear view mirror - I should not have liked this book. But as a retired military officer, I was enthralled by Martha Crabb's graphic telling of men at war. Her obviously well documented and researched stories about the brutal fighting conditions, starvation, and primitive medical care gave me a real respect for the combatants of the civil war era and just how much some parts of warfare have changed for the better. And her description of broken government promises, bureaucratic obstacles, and the occasional incompetent leader, showed how much has remained the same. This book would make a great movie"
1,shipping wrong items/all mismarked,"I ordered a phone case from the collegiante series with the Michigan State university logo on it and in green and white the school colors. I was shipped a university of Michigan case in blue and gold witht he word Michigan on the front. The product tag marks it as Michigan state, this means that all items in the inventory are mismarked.When I asked to speak to a higher up person so I could explaind the problem they said they would send an e-mail. I said I would keep the one I got and give it to a friend and that they could just ship the correct one, I would pay for the item they pay the shipping. they have no understanding of how to deal with a problem like this and I have no idea what is going on any thoughts? They told me to just reorder and see what happens. The item by the way is just fine and a good value for the $10.00"
4,one of the star sisters,"One of the star sistersWhen school starts at Quiver Junior High Celeste is the new student and the first ever black student. When Frannie meets Celeste she likes her and wants to be her friend but wonders what others will say. Frannie has also had been planning a luau. With Celeste in her choir class they try out for the soloist group to see if they can beat the popular girls. Read the book to figure out if Celeste makes friends, if the luau goes according to plan, and if Celeste and Frannie make the cut."
3,The Starplace,"Starplace is about a thirteen-year-old girl named Frannie Driscoll. She lives in a small town called Quiver in Oklahoma.The setting is mainly in the old crickety rocket in a dry field and also outside. On the first day of school she finds there is a new girl, Celeste. There is just one problem with it. Quiver Junior High is all white, and Celeste is black. Some girls in her school who think they are better than everyone else were making fun of her in the bathroom. After Frannie found out that the things that the girls were saying she told them that it wasn't true and that they need to stop spreading rumors about that. Then after that Celeste and Frannie became friends. Then they had an adventure and Frannie was going to try on some Bangle Bracelets that were in a cave. Read the book to find out is Frannie gets out of the Bracelets."
1,One of the Worst Books I've Read.,"This book was awful! The plot was predictable, the story-line simplistic, and the characters were shallow and mundane. I felt as though I was reading a book aimed at teens. The story lacked interest and came to its conclusion before any suspense was built. Although, I am reading another book by this author and thus far it had proven much, much better so...maybe this particular book was just a singular stinker."
5,Compelling first novel,"I just stayed up all night and finished this magical book! Jo, the main character, is well-drawn and complex, as are her relationships. The story has several levels that are echoed in the settings - I especially liked Florence as a haven and a place of transformation. The language is rich, at times funny, and always right on target. Brava, Katie Schneider!"
4,Ringing of Truths,"I think reviewers give out 5 stars too easily here on Amazon. Let's reserve that for the once a year absolutely incredible book. Having said that, Katie Schneider's ""All We Know of Love"" is a very, very fine book. Not everyone will enjoy it though. If someone is looking for quick diversion from their day, then they will miss the point of this book. This book will not divert you from your life, but take you toward it. If a reader is just looking for something to take up their time as they fly from LA to NY, then they will miss the beauty of this book. However, if you are the type of reader who enjoys looking into the soul of another, exploring the humanity of another, the confusions of love, the fears that artists have, and discovering pieces of yourself right there, then you will enjoy this book very much."
4,"Madness, Indeed!!!","I laughed... and I cried. The sheer terror, exhileration and mystery of why someone would undertake such a journey lingers long after the last page. Really good read!"
4,the fun of winter,"hello This book is great. Paulson creative sushines without the book.it one of his best work.The idea of his chracater is topically of one of this books. Someone is always going up against the forces of nature. The chracter always goes thought a life changing expirence. The book is to die for if you love dog,winter,and,or nature."
4,Fun book,SO many laugh out loud moments - a great read for anyone who has done animal training and had it not go so well.
2,It's a Gary Stu!,"It's obvious from the beginning that this book is a major Gary Stu (a male version of a Mary Sue, also known as Gary Sue and Marty Stu.) Marco/Viktor is Mr. Perfect. Well, except for one major flaw. He expects the women in his life to give up all their dreams and live his. When his first girlfriend refuses to give up her career to be his baby-making machine, he continues filming his movie, only to be thrown back in time. He kidnaps the step-daughter of the evil Wolfgard and again, tries to force her to change who she is to satisfy him. Even when assassins threaten he won't do the sensible thing and let her return (even for a short time) to her homeland so she'll be safe.Nope, Marco/Viktor is a male chauvinist pig who thinks all women need to do whatever he says. Whenever Reyna challenges him he threatens to spank/thrash/clobber her, even though he knows Wolfgard used to beat her with a whip!For a guy who makes his living in romance, Fabio doesn't know diddly squat about it!"
5,Excommunication,"I love to see an almost perfect ""literally correct"" excommunication by the Catholic Church. This is what needs to be done by true lawful Bishops of the Catholic Church, so few remain."
3,Becket Is Historically Inaccurate,"Becket is absolutely filled with historical inaccuracies. If the movie is your only source of information on Becket and/or Henry II, then you won't learn the truth. Becket was not a Saxon; he was a Norman. The relationship between him and Henry is also wrongly portrayed. If you want to see drama, see the movie Becket. If you actually want to learn about Henry II and Thomas Becket, read a book instead."
4,Oh What A Falling Off Was There!,"O'Toole & Burton who were drinking buddies in real life....play drinking buddies in this movie set in 12th Century England. The story has all the markings of mediveal soap opera - but hold on to your seats! One must listen closely for all the slings & arrows of dialogue superb! I suggest following this one with another O'Toole favorite - ""The Lion in Winter"" - when old Henry II meets his match in Eleanor of Aquitane played by Kate Hepburn."
5,Becket,"Richard Burton is, as always, an excellent actor and this movie is one of his best. I'm sure I'll watch it more than once."
3,long wait,"We ordered this movie so that we could watch it before our vacation to England. As it happened, the volcano in Iceland thwarted our plans. The video arrived a month later than we expected. The video was in great shape and the movie was terrific. We watched the movie in its entirety and we're now ready to visit England in the fall.We give 5 stars for the movie and the condition of the videotape, but 2 stars for the length of time between order and delivery."
4,Becket,Very fine acting but historically incorrect as was the stage play. Conflict between Becket and King was well portrayed even allowing for the fact that the characters were somewhat subverted from the real historical personalities. Well worth watching in spite of the ignorance shown in characterisation but this not the fault of the actors but of the script writer and producer.
1,check the region before you buy any DVD,"I was looking forward to view this oldie goldie in Blue Ray, but Amazon failed to mention that it's Region A. which, as it turned not supporte by my PS3!Amazon should mention the region on all DVD's very clearly."
1,...and ONE STAR is really REACHING.........,"I thought this dumb CD blew chunks and I sold it to the Used CD store a few days after I bought it....what a ""let-down"" after such a cool-ass remix of Metallica's ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" on the Spawn CD."
5,Lost in Mexico:(,"Dear Wayfarer sunglasses, I lost you. I miss you so much and hope you come back. These were my favorite glasses and lost them on the last day of my trip, hope to get another pair soon."
2,not so good,"The red frames are what drew me to these glasses...but once I put them on, the frames were on the heavy side and left marks on my cheeks after only a few minutes of wearing...so I sent them back and purchased the red framed Clubmaster's from Ray Ban and they fit perfectly"
5,Classic Choice,"The Ray Ban Wayfarer is a classic American choice, whether in the sunglass or optical category. I've worn them for years (including colors which are presently unavailable) and have always found them to be comfortable and in style. There's a resurgence in their popularity, which means that a whole new generation will discover Ray Ban's timeless style, great fit and dependable quality. Always buy for your personal comfort and best look but do give the Ray Ban Wayfarer a look and look your best."
3,Nothing to write home about,The glasses are over priced for the value. The lens are not polarized and does not give a perfectly clear view.
5,My new favorite sunglasses!!!,"These are my new favorite sunglasses. They were a birthday gift to myself. I searched a few time son Amazon for these and finally foudn them at the right price. A friend of mine has vintage shades in a slightly different color scheme, but close enough. I get compliments all the time with these. They're perfect to buy online because I know they'll fit my face; unlike the 20 or more I usually need to try on with other brands/styles. The only part I'd change is that the case is not leather (faux leather). It was shipped well, sent faster than expected and the packaging by Rayban with its own cleaning cloth and booklet was great. Thanks again!"
4,Good quality,"It is hand made in Italy . Just the packing is not new and it looked have stock for long time . But it is good looking when i ware this 2140 . Good quality , i like it ."
5,Ray Ban,"I was very pleased with my purchase, as I knew before hand what I wanted and was pleased with the ease in ordering and the timely delivery of the product."
4,Ray Bans--Wayfarers,"Great shades. Also, I ordered them just days before I needed to give them as a gift. I DID receive them BEFORE Christmas, and for that I am giving a GREAT Review to this company!Thanks,Brenda Lou Beals"
5,Ray-Ban,Ray-Ban is usually a good value here. I have ordered several pair to take to friends in Thailand. Ray-Ban is a very expensive in Thailand.
5,"great price, great sunglasses!","received on time. may be a newseller on amazon, but are willing to do things right!"
5,Extraordinary Classic,"A classic. What more can be said about a sunglass. By wearing, you are transcending decades of classic style. You were in style many years ago and will continue to be."
2,surprisingly horrible...,"I was shocked and disappointed when I received a pair that appeared to have been used. The ray ban box was worn, bent and torn. The glasses themselves appeared to have been worn with the plastic sleeves missing, the G-15 sticker worn and thrown back on and the cleaning cloth also entirely missing. This the first time I have ever received such a poor product from Amazon. I hope this isnt the start of a bad trend in shipping out used products as new."
4,Fit a big boy perfect,"I'm as cool as a cucumber when I wear these bad boys, I put them on I get instant street credit! I'm 5'9 225 and they fit me perfect, my 5'9 160 lb buddy tried them on and they were oversized on him."
5,Original wayfarers,These are just what I was looking for. My son loves them. Would buy them again if needed. Thanks so much
3,A nice PICTORIAL of talking dolls,"The photos in this book are big, clear and there are some very nice toys shown. Given the price of this book I sincerely thought it would be more thorough given the VAST amount of Mattel talking toys that were made. It is nice to have as an addition to one's collection. One thing that bothers me is that it is ""An Unauthorized Guide for Collectors"" which means that material gathered was done so without permission of Mattel and therefore may have some information errors. In addition to this book I encourage you to read ""Chatty Cathy Dolls"" and ""Talking Toys of the 20th Century"" by Don & Kathy Lewis."
4,Thorough Description,"I came across these dolls while shopping at Toys R Us for my friend's birthday.(She's 14 and still plays with dolls.Me too!)I bought it, and she said it was really cute. I probably should have read some blogs and reviews before purchasing it though.After she opened it we started ""discovering"" it,which means playing around with it to see it's feautures.We discovered that yes, the shoes come off and she actually has feet, you tap her head and her eyes change different colors, you can put a wig and hair extensions on her.She has a fragile-not very well supported body.Her legs snapped off easily,which is bad.Hope this helped"
4,Short and Sweet,"It's been a while since I read a good Conan yarn that wasn't mere jock-barbarian nonsense, and didn't expect much from another Conan book, so I was pleased-to-be-surprised with Hocking's work. A fantastic Conan yarn with a great evil villain and wonderful set-scenes, great characters (both big and small), with action that just keeps coming and coming. I didn't want to put this one down once I'd started it.The only issues I had were one or two places in the book where things slowed down for a few pages (though the payoff was worth the wait) and a few moments where certain characters seemed cliched (though, again, showed themselves much more complex as the book progressed)."
2,Not great,"I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it."
1,mac compatability,"hey guys, not sure why but the didn't make any mac software to go with this. some guy made a 3rd party software solution but it's a bit dodgy. I tried it but i'm not sure if my amazon product is defective or if the software is just that rough. i'm gonna see if the guy will take back this item and I'll try a different device. i'm wanting to use this for the line-in feature. (mini mini 3.5mm port(not a regular headphone jack)... smaller. but... here we are. i'm done with this thing and I want to get rid of it :)"
4,"Very convenient, multi-talented MP3 Player","I actually have never owned an MP3 player until now, so I don't have much to compare the Creative with. But I can tell you it's great to have a small tool that can do so many things. The radio reception is fuzzy at times and the battery life is pretty bad with the wrong batteries, but overall it has a great set up with helpful file folders to organize, great recording capabilities, plug and play option if you don't want to install the CD on every computer you use it on, and so many ways to connect it to your computer and other hardware.If you're not looking to break the bank purchasing a quality MP3 player then forget about iPod and go with Creative. (BTW: My player was red not black, but I'm sure the black one's just as high quality)"
4,The Roots track,Why is the Roots song from the soundtrack of the movie The Wood(1999)? They should of put a new song on the cd.
2,Let Down,"Had high hopes after reading some reviews, but if I had it to do over again, I'd spend my money somewhere else. This is an album you'll only want to hear once, unless you like frazzled sounds instead of music. Most of the album, the ""music"" was frantic and intentionally busy for my taste, like the musicians were trying too hard. Just didn't make me glad I bought it."
5,Very Nice Player,"Plays everything I throw at it: CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW.It has a built in Dolby 5.1 Decoder (This is the main reason I bought it), you can change/add discs while playing a movie, move the position/brightness of movie Subtitles and lots of other goodies.Do not hesitate if planning on buying this player.I am very happy and satisfied with this player."
1,Coincidences Run Amuck,"The author writes well, although too much description for my taste. The story is absurd, filled with too many coincidence, characters who seem to have the capabilities of superheros in a current day ""summer blockbuster"" movie. I have read a lot of fiction and non-fiction about World War I (the ""Great War"" presumably referenced in the title), but other than the time and locations in which the story is set, I see minimal connection to the actual World Was I other than the general pathos and overall horror of a war. There is a lot of soul searching about the relationship within families and about death, which is more interesting and somewhat inciteful, but it beats you over your head for much of the 880 pages and to me did not seem all that profound."
3,"Overlong, overrated","This should have been a book half the length, telling the story of an Italian soldier caught in the horror of WWI. But the author wraps around this tale the story of an old man taking his last long walk, lots of overblown descriptions of scenery, and way too much dime store psychology. Also, if you're looking for a realistic plot, this book is not for you. Read it on the airplane."
5,At the Top,Quite simply one of the best books I have ever read. Mark Helprin is one of the finest authors alive. You should not miss any of his novels.
5,"Not Just a Book, an Experience","This novel ranks up there with ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" and ""The Cider House Rules."" Beautifully written, emotionally lifting--a real mix of the imagination and the heart. Leaves you thinking about life long after you have finished it."
2,"OK, but they blew it on the CD","I was enjoying the cultural material, and thought they did a reasonably good job of introducing pinyin and the sounds of Mandarin, and providing practice material in the book and CD.It all fell apart though when I got to page 39, where I was supposed to ""repeat the following sentences after the reader as you listen to the CD"". It's a conversation between two speakers, and the problem is that they do not pause between sentences as they are spoken to give you a chance to emulate them. The tracks for practicing individual vocabulary words have pauses for repetition, but all the practice conversations I checked do not. I don't know how this is supposed to aid me pronouncing sentences in Mandarin. It was a real disappointment, and I had to find a new book."
5,"Excellent adaptation, true to Doyle's story","Please ignore the review by the ignoramus above. The dialogue between Holmes and Moran in THE EMPTY HOUSE is a faithful transcription of what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually wrote. The first three years of this series produced some outstanding episodes and THE EMPTY HOUSE is one of the best. It's beautifully directed and well written. Edward Hardwicke is excellent as the new Watson and Jeremy Brett is fascinating to watch, and even more fascinating to listen to. There is an amusing pastiche sequence at the start which takes place in the coroner's court. It nicely rounds out this story without padding it. The supporting players, particularly the excellent Colin Jeavons and Rosalie Williams, work well as an ensemble. You will want to watch this directly after viewing THE FINAL PROBLEM, another terrific episode; the two should really be sold as a set!"
5,Jeremy Brett is Sherlock Holmes,I am once again transfixed on my television and I have gleefully tossed out all my home tapes of the PBS series - they were horrible quality. What can I say...like a kid in a candy store..which episode do I watch next...were all life's problems so easy to deal with... I have most all of the old B&W ones in various 'collections' but...to me...there has been no Holmes like Mr. Brett. I would definitely recommend any and all of these episodes to EVERYONE!! A true 'must see'. Superb! I have them all up to date as far as I know but I am hoping for more releases.
2,Not Too Good!!!,"I love the movie, but this game is very hard to play. The controls are weird and awkward. You can't jump and hit at the same time. You play as Fred Flintstone, and I have no idea what the plot is. You go around and hit frogs and other cavemen with clubs and a bowling ball. I wouldn't recommend THE FLINTSTONES VIDEO GAME!!!"
3,Shocking! But Somewhat Funny!,"Some of the material on this DVD was funny, but not as funny as Don't Try This At Home The Steve-O Video Vol. 1. This one sonded more shocking so I bought it and I was a little creeped out about how Steve-O sets a girl's [chest] on fire(That wasn't funny at all). It still gives me the creeps. And how a guy gets the [stuff] beatin out of him with a skateboard. They show a warning before viewing it and That was not funny what so ever as well as this guy taking the most nastiest [pooh] ever. It goes all over the bathroom stalls. It's not really something to look forward to. I did however like 3/4 of it though. So if you like shocking/supposedly funny stuff then check this one out! Some of the stuff was stupid I had to laugh, but if Steve-O comes out with a Vol. 3 I would most certainly buy that too because it seems he puts the nastiest material on Vol.2 and it just makes since that if a Vol.3 came out. It would be even worse! But I do give him credit!"
1,Not a Jackass,Locks like a drugtrip with chiks and stupid violent guys...Don't pay money for this...you wont laugh about it.Really bad how a guy beats another up with his board...hope the police caught him...a dissapointing SteveO
1,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO HIS FIRST VIDEO,"Being a fan of Jackass and the first Steve-O video, I was glad to tell my friends to come over and watch the new Steve-O video. BIG MISTAKE! This is the worst piece of junk ever! I was embarrased to say I bought this. Thankfully, all the people that STAYED to end knew that I thought it'd be as good as the first.I think Steve-O was trying to capitalize on the JACKASS MOVIE that just came out. BAD IDEA! I was going to go see his show here in Phoenix but I've decided not to after this video.If you want a video with less stunts and less laughs, this is for you. Do yourself a favor and wait until they are practically giving this away for free on your favorite auction site or second hand market."
3,Dirty and Rough,"It amazes me they can sale these type things in regular stores....this stuff belongs in adult shops. Lots of naked people, violent, filth, you name it. Its worst than Jackass The Movie as far as ""dirty"" goes. Really not funny. The Jackass volumes 3 & 2 are much better and they're funny! One guy on here even sets his ""manhood"" on fire, lots of gross bathroom scenes. This DVD is for die hard fans who are really looking for a shock. Don't buy it if youre not an adult though.."
1,Don't waste your money......,"Hey. I bought this DVD praying that it was different from the first one. This was an AWEFUL Dvd. The [stuff] seen at the end made me puke, no joke. The scene with the mexican and a skateboard made me cringe. He asks innocent strangers to get on a skateboard and once they're on, he pushes it out from under them. Then, he wrecks a guys car and when the guy starts confronting him, the mexican beats him over the head several times with the skateboard. It was an aweful DVD. Don't waste you money. Unless you wanna see lotsa penis's and hardly any boobs, I wouldn't buy this."
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be funny, it's not, it lacks stunts, it's mostly behind the scenes stuff which to be honest is boring. It lacks the comedy of Jackass and what stunts it does have are just not funny. In one scene Steve-o sets a girls chest on fire, I don't find that funny, it's kind of weird.Am a big fan of the jackass series and I bought this thinking it would be just as good, but it's a poor mans attempt at humour. Mostly Steve-o is out of his head on drugs and it shows alot. I hope the first in the series is better, this was just a waste of money.1 Star"
2,Poor Taste,"I didn't find the stuff funny...just disturbing. I'm not averse to this kind of film--after all, these nuts are doing things at their own risk--however, the south padre gangster scene was incredibly disturbing. Not to be a spioler, but basically this skater guy is goofing off and his board hits this guy's car. When the guy confronts him, the skater guy clobbers the guy in the head with his skateboard three times. He also kicks him when he's down. The guy gets up and staggers down the street. He's lucky he's not dead. This was out of one of those scenes out of Faces of Death. To me, Steve-O and Jackass are about stunts and all, but that one scene (where an innocent bystandard gets assaulted) really ruined things for me."
1,Ripped,Couldn't believe I had to buy this separate. Bought Wolos best compressor and a top of the line Horn. Three hundred plus for the setup. After it arrives I learn I need this value and a button to make things work. Companies that do business like this don't deserve our business. I don't recommend wolos products and I won't buy them again.
1,Worst of Jude Deveraux Books,"I am a big Jude Deveraux fan, but this is the worst one I have read. In my library I have 42 Jude Deveraux books that I have read, but would tell any other fan to miss this one. The story line, was choppy and there were sections in the book that were not necessary to the storyline. Not a typical Jude Deveraux book. Still a fan of the author but not this book. Skip this book in your search of books to read."
4,Good read,LOVED how the man is the hero and finally takes control of the situation!!! Loved the time period of the story.
3,Long and drawn out,"I,like Jude Deveraux books,but in this story it was too long and I lost interest many times. I still enjoyed it ."
2,disappointing,"I love Jude Deverauxs books but I have to say that this one was indeed disappointing. I just finished Edilean series and have to say all of them where great books, but this one, I couldn't even finish it. The kidnapping and the near rape, come on! And Morgan beautiful but not beautiful, no way. Waste of time book. My favorite was Remembrance, the Taming, the Conquest (what a book!) The summerhouse series and so much more, but this one,dont even boughter"
1,The Enchanted Land,"While reading other reviews of this book, I'm beginning to wonder if I read the same book as others! This was the worst book I have read. No sympathy toward Morgan and what she went through. And Seth, betrays her because of a kiss? He doesn't like women, and yet can't see through their conniving when it comes to Morgan? The character's were completely unbelievable, and I can't believe Morgan would put up with Seth, especially when he ""kidnaps"" her at the end. As if she wouldn't be completely tramatized after what she has been through before!! Yuck!"
2,Forgettable,I actually recently bought this book and read it for a second time accidentally. I was about two thirds if the way done before I realized that the overworked plot seemed vaguely familiar. I have to say that there is a reason that I forgot this book: it isn't that great. Ms. Deveraux has provided a few good reads for me over the years but this isn't one of them. The characters are flat and the story is just too full of contrived plot twists. I don't recommend buying this book even once.
5,From the Back Cover:,"Curries is a mouthwatering collection of traditional and contemporary recipes for creating your own delicious curries. Featuring a wide variety of Indian, Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian, Sri Lankan, and Burmese recipes for:- Chicken- Duck- Beef- Pork- Lamb- Seafood- Vegetables- Fruit- Rice- Breads- Sambals- LassisGorgeous photographs and step-bystep recipes make preparing curries as easy as can be."
2,"Great curls, but...","I was very excited to get this iron. I tried it out and it definitely makes some nice curls, but after just one use the purple coating on the barrel as well as on and underneath the clip was already coming off. I could see the bare metal. I'd probably try a hot tools iron again but not this one specifically."
3,Good While It Lasted,"I owned this curling iron for a year. It was a great curling iron and I didn't have any of the problems that other people complain about with this or other curling irons. It didn't burn my hair, get too hot, It didn't have any buttons in the wrong places that I could mistakenly turn off while in use, the plastic knob at the end stayed cool, it held my hair, it curled my hair with even heat...which it was supposed to do. It was the right length and size and easy to hold...BUT THE POWER CORD WENT BAD AFTER A YEAR OF USE. Now I am purchasing another Hot Tools iron, but I am not going to spend the extra money on the ceramic because it sounds like a number of other people have had the problem of the Hot Tools products ""just dying"", and you just may be buying another curling iron sooner than you thought again with the Hot Tools brand."
2,Unwieldy and ineffective,"Didn't like this product at all. It is very difficult to handle and the curls, if at all you get them, come out in a weird shape. Product didn't come with good ""how to"" instructions either. Not recommended."
4,just what i was looking for,i wanted an iron of good quality. i was given advice from a hair stylist about this product. it really did prove to be as expected. i am really satisfied. it makes doing my daughter and my hair as easy as 123.
5,You can't put it down!,"This book grabs your attention in the first few pages and keeps you hooked until the end. Historical facts back up a believable story that you can relate to. Action and emotion are in every chapter and keep the reader up late reading just one more chapter. The heroine, Emma Jordan, is a survivor of the best kind. The book gives us a glimpse of life in the old frontier and the American spirit that made this country great."
3,It's not bad at all but when it is all over it is bad,When I bought it the game was the best and the Gym Leaders and much better the the yellow version the graphs are better but they aren't that good so if you are looking for an game for good graphs this isn't the one for you but I can admit it was a really fun game before I beat it.
4,a good game for people who like pokemon,"This game while it is fun when get it after you beat it it is not as much fun. The new features such as the day and night, the new pokeballs and the new types of pokemon the dark and the steel are a good but it could still be better. I think you should be able to fight with people who have the red,blue and yellow versions it just isn't as much fun just being able to fight have aganist people who have the gold, silver and crystall versions.It is also a pain when you trade pokemon I mean pokemon like pikachu who knows a move like zapcanon can not be traded with people who have pokemon blue red and yellow it gets to be a pain having to get my pokemon that I can trade to the blue red and yellow you have to go to blackthron city and talk to te move deleter to remove the move before you can trade it. Other than that this game is ok but if you have a game boy advance I would what untill pokemon advance comes to the United States."
5,Pokemon Gold,"I got this game from my cousin. Oh boy is it great! I don't have any badges, but I think I will get one today. I like the part where each day's a different character and how Johto and Kanto are combined. I have the Official Player's Guide, so it makes life easier. It is great!"
5,Can't Wait Til Volume 5 Comes Out,"The story really picks up in this collection. There are some of the best Dark Shadows storylines here. From Dr. Woodard's and Burke Devlin's deaths, to the aging of Barnabas, to the beginning of the 1795 flashback, it is all here and very exciting. If you have the first three, you have to get this one."
3,Tried these for a change of pace,"I picked up these rather than the more traditional springs as cat toys to give our cats some variety. They do play with them from time to time, but the construction means they roll less far and often ""settle"" in one spot since one side is obviously heavier and once momentum cannot overcome gravity, the spring will be unable to keep rolling forward. Since they don't roll very far, our cats lose interest pretty quickly as compared to regular springs."
2,Not for my cat,my cat only looks at it if i throw it around. he would not play with it at all! would not recommend this product
3,Slightly disappointed,"Way into the HoliestI paid the price for new but received used, albeit in reasonably good condition, but definitely used with personal markings etc. The content of the actually book is excellent."
5,A new genre is born: ambient noir bluegrass,"The bizarre backcover description drew me to buy this, i.e., banjo = ""country gadget."" Some of this, especially the last 2 tracks, go farther out there than many might dare venture. But strong musicality and the patience of a river sculpting a canyon make this the smooth, sophisticated older sibling of Cornelius' ""Fantasma."""
2,Disappointed,"I bought this video and was sorely disappointed. It is definitely not a good choice as my first Yoga tape. Although there is someone in the class doing a modified version of the poses, I felt they weren't modified enough. Many times, it seemed like she was doing the exact same pose as the instructor, except for the fact that her knees were a little bent. This experience hasn't soured me on yoga, though. I'll just be more thorough in my research before I make a purchase. It has, however, soured me on the Crunch series. This is the second Crunch tape I've purchased and I was unhappy with both."
2,"For a gym known for good workouts, this one fell short","This video started out great...however, the downfall of taking an aerobic instructor and making a yoga instructor out of her...she gets too caught up in explaining where your hands and feet are suppose to be -- trying to tell you by mirror image where you're suppose to be...and she has an extremely irritating voice!!! Daffy Duck! The workout's okay, but it's nothing like a true yoga workout."
3,Nice on the Outside,"I have one of these beds that I bought in July. It is used sometimes by a 45 lb dog and sometimes by a 30 lb dog. There is now a concave area in the bed where the dogs lie. The foam has compressed and never fully restored. Although the bed is 6 inches thick, the area where they sleep is hardly over an inch thick now. The cover is very nice and has held up to washings and dog wrestling, but the foam is not good. It appears to be two 3 inch pieces of eggcrate-type foam glued together. Maybe it was a bad batch of foam."
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!!,"Where's the funny George Carlin everyone talks about? I got a sacreligious, gripey, anti-america, and liberal old man. Did I get the wrong George Carlin? This couldn't POSSIABLY be the one everyone says is so hilarious! There was 1 scene that was even remotely funny, but all I got was a smile, but I NEVER laughed out loud. Please don't buy it online, and if you see it at Borders avoid it at ALL costs. Why, oh, WHY did I waste my money?"
5,"Great Pan, Bad Shipping from Amazon","This pan is heavy yet awesome. I bought this pan, a 4 qt saucepan, a 3 qt saucepan, and a 5 1/2 qt saute pan. I bought all four on one order but all arrived in different boxes, in different conditions and from different shipping companies. The 5-1/2 qt saute pan was shipped via FedEx in the Cuisinart box with one end resealed with a piece of cardboard and lots of tape - the helper handle of the pan was the tiniest bit scratched. The saucepans were put in an amazon box and shipped via UPS perfectly. The Everything pan was shipped via a weirldy named shipping company that FedEx uses and was fine. 5 stars on the pans, but 1 1/2 stars for Amazon. This is the first time of the hundreds of items and times that I have used Amazon that I was not very happy with the way things were shipped."
4,"Cool song collection, but this book is NOT tabbed.","I've been using this book for several years and really enjoy picking the dozen or so classic Buffett tunes in it. The songs are in standard notation only, NOT tablature as indicated on the product listing, and there are also abbreviated ""cheat sheet"" versions with chord charts at the back of the book, which is mainly what I use with my acoustic based on the style of this music. There are a few minor errors (e.g. wrong chord notation) which you will figure out the first time you play. This book is worth having if you're a Buffett fan, but don't expect tabs."
5,Does a great job in high wind,We get a lot of wind across the front of our house and it tears everything apart. The bracket is able to stand up to anything that has been thrown at it. Well made and it looks great!
4,Not bad at all,"I enjoyed the book even though it didn't get me hooked compleatly. There are too many stories going on with the other caracters that messes up with the flow of the story. I gave it 4 stars since the author is a favorite of mine, but I will stick to her historical books rather then contemporary. All in all it was a very good read if not excellent."
1,Cannot hear!,"These phones are terrible. It is very difficult to hear the person you are talking to. I bought the phones to replace an older Uniden model. After a few days of straining to hear callers, I switched back to the Uniden.The phones have cheap ""feel."" They are rather light, which relfects the poor workmanship of the phone.A friend at work purchased the same model and had the same trouble. I will not buy any more Southwestern Bell branded products."
2,"Great photography, but if you are a Ford fan, don't bother","The book is very much GM, and to a lesser degree, Mopar-oriented. With a couple exceptions, Ford muscle cars are generally dismissed. Even the 80's Fox body Mustang, generally regarded as the car most responsible for re-igniting the horsepower wars we see today, is given only begrudging recognition.The photography is great, especially of stripper, dog-dish-hubcapped examples of classic muscle cars."
2,"Good, BUT.......","This book answered a lot of questions, but was too hyper and anal. What to Expect should come shrink wrapped with the Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy, to prevent panic attacks. I had preterm labor and found nothing in this book to help me out or understand what was going on."
1,WRONG COLORS!!!,"You might sell more of these if they weren't the rival teams colors. Hawkeyes are Black and Gold, Go Hawks!cyclones are red and gold. No Hawkeye fan will buy this."
5,"Fresh Air, At Last!","Somewhere between a 'breath of fresh air' and a 'Nor-easter' comes the voice of Pat Lynch with The Five Secrets that will ""Set You Free and Change Your Life Forever!"" Every page is life experience condensed down to bare essentials that are designed to blow small boxes to smitherines. I LOVED IT!!!These ""Five Secrets"" are NOT the kind to keep --- they deserve a wide broadcast because of their potential to help us set our lives on true course. Pat's formula isn't a bit complicated. However, it's very simplicity (like all truths) consistently shakes what we think we know until we can actually see. He shows us how to set ourselves directly on the road to an authentic life.These 108 pages with five (5) easy steps have picked me up and turned me around. I will re-read this many times as I head on down the road......rejuvenated and inspired. Thanks to Pat Lynch for a readable map."
2,Incomplete Set,I ordered two copies for gifts - both copies were missing DISC TWO! This looks like a common problem. I hope I get my replacements with both DVDs!I would rate the content higher when I get to see the whole thing - DISC 1 was excellent!
1,Different but no good,"After reading the more positive reviews, I thought this would surely be one of those ""different, but good"" new sounds for me. Not at all, I didn't enjoy it at all. It has no what I might call SOUL in it...in otherwords, it is the same thing over and over again and sounds like background music to a murder mystery or very sad love story. I don't recommend buying it without listening to it."
1,Beware: Not compatible with newer Mac computers,"I just bought this version of Reader Rabbit Playtime for Baby & Toddler (2000). I put the disk in my Mac and got an error code about the disk not supported in the classic environment. Bummer! After reading software troubleshooting posts, I'm understanding that this software doesn't run on newer mac machines. I'm running the current version (10.5.8) of Mac OS X. Hope that saves somebody from making the same mistake I did!"
3,Very mediocre for a Magic Flute fan...,"I was excited about this book because ""Magic Flute"" is one of my favorite stories. However while I did find myself enjoying it, I am not sure if I really appreciated this particular feminist take on it. Sometimes I think that a feminist take on an old beloved tale is great, however there are other times where it just distorts the story. I think that Nights Daughter by Marion Zimmer Bradley probably has a better attempt at having a feminst take on the story. And for an even better treat, score a copy of the Ingmar Bergman production of Magic Flute through netflix or your local library."
3,It's an ok Book,"Quick read, good storyline but lack substance and character development. May be a good book for a middle school age student"
5,Solid book. A single book that covers all the bases.,"I just got this book. This book is different from other Web Service books that go on and on about one or two topics. Instead, this book looks at developing enterprise applications using Web Services and addresses all of the issues that enterprise architects and developers face. The writing is informal and easy to understand. Some of the chapters are a little longer than is needed. But, definately a solid resource. A ""one stop shop"" for Web Services and enterprise software. Cheers."
3,"Carlin has done much better, but it was OK.","I own 4 Carlin's videos, it was the worst I saw. But it was worth it watching because it is from Carlin, a professional."
2,Overrated,"The expansion pack items aren't as good as the downloads from several of the popular, trustworthy sites available. But its nice if you're not into downloading custom content."
1,Looks great but don't put it outside!,"I looked at a lot of bird feeders and thought this one looked great. But after it was outside for just one week, all of the paint has cracked and is peeling off in big and little pieces. If I keep it, I'll have to sand the whole thing down and prime and paint it myself. What a disappointment!"
2,Disappointing Effort From The Masters,"After Tosca's Dehli 9 and the much loved Suzuki album, J.A.C is a disappointing album. The sounds are generic, almost blending into the background, and definitely no stand out tracks. These Viennese Masters in this album fail deliver that particular ecletic and sophisticated sounds which they are famous for. Looking forward to their next effort, sure it will be better. Sorry."
4,Review a pencil?,I use it to lay landmarks on canvas before I start painting. It does an excellent job for this purpose.
2,third time is NOT a charm,"This summer I took my third whack at this book and STILL found that after page 50 or so I was reading it only because I felt I ""should."" The historicity and intrigue don't compensate for the TEDIOUS WRITING. I'm going to give away my copy and try to forget that I ever attempted it."
4,Clausen is a Genuis,"The Sage and the Scarecrow takes you on the scariest ride of all young adulthood. It makes you laugh in one paragragh and cry in the next. The author gives you a look into the mind of the main chacter. Pierce is a funny and a deeply emotional charcter, and the supporting cast provides an ungiue blend of personalities. The Sage and the Scarecrow makes you think while making you laugh."
1,they run very small....,"make sure you order a size up, i bought this shoes for my daughter and the were size 5 but they felt like a 4, very small, I had to return them right away. very disappointing."
5,Godzilla & Ifukube triumph,"This is an especially good and comprehensive CD of the music of the classic Showa-period Godzilla era. Maestro Akira Ifukube's vibrant monster marches and horror themes particularly stand out, as do the informative liner notes inside... unusually extensive for a simple fold-out piece of paper. Overall the music selection is very good, but I have one minor quibble: more of King Ghidora's themes would have made the disc truly complete, as would have more monster sound FX (Japanese import discs of the latter can get quite expensive). However, these are only minor points. This would be an excellent CD to introduce Western fans to the wild world of kaiju music...I have a couple of friends who work in the movie business here in L.A. who were positively enchanted by it. And on a side note, it's also a nice disc to listen to while reading a Godzilla-related book...not quite as distracting as a movie!"
5,Satisfied.,"I just got my pair of Boots today in the mail. I was actually expecting them to arrive Jan.4th-Han.8th, but they came two days earlier ! So, I was very surprised and happy about that. At first when I opened the box, I thought they were used because the shoe box was all ""worn out"" and stuff, but the shoes weren't used. They are actually cuter than they appear on the picture. I love them. THey are sooo comfy and they look great on me unlike my friend's Emu Boots. The sole is the strong-durable like kind. Made of rubber, and you can roll the top of the boots so the fur on the inside will show. I was going to get a size 8 but they werent available so I got a size 7.5 instead. They fit perfectly. Still leaving room for my toes to wiggle around. They are amazing. They came early, they were a great price- I think mine were around $15-$19! That's a great deal for brand new boots like these. I really like them. Thank You !"
2,Doesn't Cover Design At All,"I find it hard to configure an RT site from this text. Maybe I haven't given it a deep enough read, but it seems to lack the overall design ideas that tie together the features into a coherent whole."
4,Great Catalogue,"This is a great catalogue for those seeking info not accessible by the normal public, like how to be your own mortician."
5,Great Album * Sad Admirer,"I first became a fan of Ms. McCorkle in 1996 when I heard Susannah on public radio doing some of her work including stuff from then new album ""Easy to Love: The Songs of Cole Porter"". I was immediately enthralled and ran out and bought the CD. I love this compilation of Cole Porter songs. It's great to sit out on the porch at sunset, sipping wine and listen to this entire album, bidding farewell to another glorious day. I was saddened by her death as I'd been planning since 1998 to make a trip to New York City with the sole intent to catch one of Susannah's shows. God bless you Susannah, I hope to catch your act when I get to Heaven!"
2,This cd had some bright spots that made me smile,"This is another Susannah Mccorkle cd for me to add to my collection. It is a lot better than some of Susannahs' other cds.Susannah, as well as the band, seemed to be hiting on all cylinders for this project. Their interpetations of the songs were good. Susannahs' voice never sounded better. This is a cd that the performers seemed to enjoy playing on and I think this feeling has spilled over to the listener as well.I think the repertoire performed her left a lot to be desired.Cole Porter sure pinned a lot of wonderul songs that were excluded from this project.I know it's impossible to please all the fans of Susannah, so some of us fans will just have to be half pleased with this cd.Recommendation: I think it would be alright to buy this cd."
3,Not worth the money,"After using the Mavica MVC-FD90 for several months, sending it back to Sony and carrying on a lengthy dialog with them, I can truthfully say, it's not worth the money. Of course the bells and whistles are OK, the MPEG's are fine and it takes great pictures at maximum resolution. There is no reason for it to even have the 640 X 480 or email resolutions, the pictures are horrible. In those resolutions, the subject has a ""halo"" around it or them, the faces looked wrinkled and the picture is of overall poor quality. After sending it back to Sony, they returned it saying that was just the way it worked. Further, I use the memory stick and it takes forever to load a picture and transferring 70 or 80 pictures from the disk to the computer hard drive takes 4 to 5 minutes. Folks, this camera is just plain clunky and there are many digital cameras out there at half the price that will do as good or better of a job. Caveat Emptor!!!!"
1,PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM BEST DEAL SUPPLY FORMERLY KNOWN AS MTA TRADING INC!,BUYER BEWARE!PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM BEST DEAL SUPPLY FORMERLY KNOWN AS MTA TRADING INC!Do NOT buy this product from BEST DEAL SUPPLYI have been waiting over 4 months for my return refund to be credited to my account.Very shady they changed their name from MTA Trading Inc to Best Deal Supply.PLEASE DO NOT BUY FROM BEST DEAL SUPPLY!
5,Never had a problem!,"I've been using the same printer with the same cartriges (not the same cartriges literaly, I mean, I run out and buy another... you know what I mean) for about 3 years now and never had a problem, hopefully it stays that way!"
2,not quite what i expected,"i was not going to be able to print unless i refilled the color cartridge. so i popped the old one out andput the new one in. it helped to print the current project, but there is NO COLOR at all when i printanything! i am kinda angry about that, but am getting around it and finding a non-color version ofstuff to print. but what shall i do when there is no choice but a color version???"
4,fits my can printer,"i am yet to use this item but i guess it works since it is the same product i have been using for my canon pixma printer. Unless there is something wrong with this particular brand, i can say it is a good purchase"
1,poor performance,"The Pixma cartridges 30, 31, 40, 41 performed poorly. They ran out of ink too quickly and replacing them was much too expensive. I am looking for another printer after spending hundreds of dollars on ink. I refuse to buy any more Pixma cartridges."
1,Don't waste your money,Not what was expected. Took hours to figure out where to mount it in my 2006 Chevy Silverado 2500HD. Then it was no louder than my stock horn. Within a week of installation it was no more than a squeak. Now it doesn't work at all. Can't return it because it's mounted in the truck engine compartment. Not sure what to do with it. Is it the compressor? Is it the horns? No way to tell. What a waste of money.
2,where De Mille gave up,"Before this book the author seemed capable of great things and certainly showed a lot of promise. Spencerville seems to be sections of several different books, the most interesting what happens when the opposing sides of the Vietnam Generations reunite 20 years later.At some pont however he decided to stick a small melodrama into the pages and let it all go, and since then he has written nothing more than page turners, the last embarassingly bad."
4,One of the better ones,I found after reading Plumb Island I became a fan and started to read others like Cathedral and General Daughter. Spencerville appealed to me because of the setting..A small town and a guy who returns to fulfill his soul. I would have preferred a different ending but the book kept me reading. Better than Cathedral and Gen. Daughter.
3,Not his best.,"I would have to rate Spencerville at the bottom of the list of his books I have read. Almost a romance novel! Wait, I think it was a romance novel. It was okay but not up to his usual style."
2,Who is ghost writing for DeMille?,"After reading DeMille's intelligent ""Word of Honor"" and the terrific, sardonic ""General's Daughter,"" had high hopes for this book. But it never delivered - could not believe in the stupid actions of lead character and didn't really care. The book failed in plot line, tension buildup, and any semblance of realistic or interesting character definition. Makes me think that this book was written early in DeMille's career (or by someone else) and pulled out of mothballs. Nelson, please come back to us in ""Plum Islsnd.&quot"
1,Don't buy this book,This was garbage. Usually DeMille writes a great story with good characters but this is nothing but macho sex and raw language with a stupid storyline. I am sorry I bought the book. Demille tricked his fans on this one.
4,De Mille is great as usual,"Keith Landry has been an espionage agent for the US government for twenty-five years when he retires and returns to his parent's farm in Spencerville. He still carries a torch for his old girlfriend and the feeling is mutual. Unfortunately while he has been away she has married and had a couple of kids. Her husband is vindictive and power crazy and is the local sheriff. Keith and Annie renew their relationship, but even before that Baxter is after him on any pretext whatsoever. As usual De Mille produces a fast paced thriller from page one to the end."
2,very disappointed,"I usually buy Nelson Demille's book without any hesitation. But Spencervile really disappointed me. Love story didn't suit him very well. I more like his other books like 'Chamb School', 'Plum Island'."
1,It was missing a piece,I bought this adapter to install my new Pioneer car stereo. Perhaps the wiring harness fits some dodge models but it didn't fit mine. The year was correct. I had to go to my local Wally World and buy another adapter. The new adapter came with the 2 that are included in this package as well as a third one. The third one did the trick for me. I used it on a 2002 Dodge Ram.
1,Poor catalog description,"I see people recommending these when installing a new radio. I guess I don't see what problem these harnesses solve.I want to put a new radio in an old car; I would think that is the most common application. In this situation, this exact harness is still in the old car.The harness is described as being for a specific car, but is not compatible with a new radio in any way; you still have to solder all of the wires from the new radio harness.The only application I can think of is if you want to take a radio from an old car and put it in another car (and you are unable to take the harness from the old car); seems like a pretty rare situation.I studied the Metra site pretty carefully, and still couldn't understand the intended use of this product.UPDATE: See the comment chain for useful details. I still give it one star, but now because I received the wrong product, not because the product is necessarily bad."
1,does not fit,This items does not fit 2005 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Unlimited with factory stereo wire harness. Spent the time to do all of the connections from the new stereo wire harness to this harness only to find out that it is not even close to being the right one for this jeep.
4,For a professional touch.,"With this item I was able to match the wire colors and make the installation of my new radio go very easy, smooth as silk."
4,Inspiring!,"I rented this movie on my Kindle. It gives a beautiful collage of Tibetan Buddhism. It doesn't try to solve any problems or make any major points, just gives a glimpse or overall feeling of the teachings. I also liked that it discussed nuns and their activities and also had interviews with the Karmapa. There are quite a few long sections in the film that are un-narrated scenes, which I found quite wonderful to just observe and feel, but others might be expecting more action. It's a very quiet documentary."
1,"Should be called ""Talking with a disgruntled Buddhist Nun""",Not recommended - the subject of the video is not captured at all in the title. There are lots of long sequences with music and no words. I was very disappointed.
1,Unwatchable and Incomprehensible,"Truly a waste of time, effort and money. I happen to view a lot of films, and this one is pretty much at the bottom. I would summarize by saying that it is a meaningless bore distinguished by poor lighting, no discernible plot, and long lapses of inaction. It is the height of folly that this film actually receivied accolades from the so-called ""Artistic Community."" I'm no Philistine--but please!! Avoid this one at all costs."
4,"Unlikely Anime, a sleeper hit!","I remeber when this Anime, Hellsing was played on the Action network. For the action anime, just a year or so before [Adult Swim] even aired. But this Anime was extemly enjoyable. Becuase of three main aspects Story, Music, and Animation. At times it seems alittle choppy but the series it's self spirals to a total destruction theme. Thats was very entertaining Two thumbs up!"
5,Holds Such a Place in My Heart,"This NIV study Bible has been such a precious wonderful tool that God has used in my life to sanctify me with his Word. The NIV translation itself is such a smooth and easy read without going too far toward the paraphrase direction like some modern translations are prone to do. In speaking about the study notes, we must always keep in mind that they are not infallible, but in the case of this particular Bible, the notes are so utterly helpful in understanding the text. This is the primary Bible I use when conducting personal and group Bible study. I think that every Christian in the english speaking world would do good to get one of these Bibles. Praise the Lord for an easy to understand yet true-to-the-text study Bible! Thank you."
5,Zondervan NIV Study Bible,Sent this to a non-Christian who is diligently reading and understanding it. Waiting upon the Holy Spirit to do its work in his life. First time he has ever read the Old Testament and 50 years since he read some of the New Testament.He likes the cross references and the footnotes.
1,Mas vale no leerlo,"Como se ve en la sinopsis del libro en ingles, por una lectura (muy breve, para no sufrir excesivamente), se confirma el comentario en el sentido de que la autora, en efecto, carece de toda pretension literaria, ya que pasta de escritora no tiene ni habra tenido nunca, solo de ensuciadora de laminitas de celulosa sacrificada para permitirle emitir sus zonceras. Para colmo de males, este libro sale en casi todas las busquedas, como basura indeseada y estorbante. Habria sido tal vez mas interesante de haberlo escrito en castellano la tipa, pero eso, sin duda alguna, habria sido pedirle peras al olmo. No gasten plata en este simulacro literario, indigno de ni un minuto de lectura."
3,Garage door emergency release kit,"Overall, a good product. My garage does not have a service (human-sized) door, so if the electric opener stops working for whatever reason, there's no way in. This product lets you get into your garage even during a power outage without damaging your door, electric opener, or windows. Seems decently constructed, although someone could easily break in by prying this lock off of your door. Buyer beware, but I've been happy with it so far."
2,george carlin that krazy hippie,"the george carlin HBO show was funny, some things were a bit outdated but some things were really timely, all n all funny though..krazy hippie!!!"
4,nice little mp3,"no complaints from this reviewer ;this is the 3rd Creative product which I've purchased;the other 2 are still working good and I got this one because it's small enough to carry in my shirt pocket. I always keep it in a plastic pouch so maybe that's helped the battery lid from breaking off. never experienced any problem loading music or mp3 podcasts from my laptop, I just drag and drop the files into my mp3 player & works beautifully."
4,One good start,"I'm a relatively new student of Japanese, and I found this book to be useful.The book is arranged in 34 sections, in 3 parts, with numbered illustrations and 3 indexes to make things easier to find.True, it's not as fun as Marc Bernabe's ""Japanese in Mangaland"" books, but it's not exactly a dry, confusing textbook either."
5,Fantastic illustrations and brilliant message!,Whatcha Doing? is a wonderful book for younger children. My daughter loves this book so much that we have bought her friends copies!!! The illustrations are beautiful and the moral of reading to your children is uplifting.
4,naked but not not exercise.,"this is about attractive women exercising naked , the camera work is good ,the models are attractive with very nice bodies,it is an erotic video not an exercise video, if you are looking for erotica, this is good."
3,...kinda dull,"I bought this video with the idea that there is no way a video entitled Totally Nude Aerobics could possibly dissapoint. I WAS WRONG. This is yet another example of how ""art"" and T&A just are not a good mix. I wanted to see naked girls bouncing around having fun. Instead I saw lifeless ,dehumanized mannequins exercising in monotenous ,repetive movements. If you see 30 seconds of this video ,you have seen it all. I will never understand why anyone would invest time and money in pretentious erotica...what a bore."
4,delaying shots,"Some of the shots should have been a little more delayed ,however , the cd in general was great , I enjoyed it very much .Thank You."
4,"I was hoping for perfection, did not quite get it","The girls did not always look enthusiastic about being out there. Some were not that flexible, and could not perform the exercises like the Showtime girls. Same with the girls bodies, they were not as ""fit"" as the originals. I was also surprised that they did not do the sit-up routine where the girls perform the abs and bicycle exercises. But the music was good, and seemed to fulfill its promise of nude aerobics in the ""Ron Harris"" tradition. I would still recommend it."
3,"Interesting read, but...","questionable validty. Alexander Lowen swore by the process of bioenergetic analysis/exercises. But I seriously doubt the validity of such claims. However, Ive never gone through the process, so I cannot speak for it. I do love Alexander Lowen though... seemed like a decent guy. I think if you are interested in reading the book, then go ahead. If not convinced by the tenants of bioenergetic analysis, you will atleast find some gems of wisdom in this book..."
2,Disappointed,"Loved the look of the coffeemaker, but was hard to fill and when we both poured our coffee more was on counter top than in the cup. We returned with of course no problems with Amazon."
4,"Good Coffee, Easy to Use, Pours Cleanly,Looks Nice","This coffee maker makes good coffee, is easy to use and does not dribble coffee when you pour (at any speed). The clock and timer are easy to use. It also looks nice.Cons: I have noticed some drips when I sneak a cup early. It would be nice to have an auto shutoff beep to warn you that it has turned off.Overall a good coffee maker, I would buy it again."
1,Cheap material -- arrived broken,"I was on the fence between this coffee maker and the more expensive Kitchen Aid one. I went for the cheap and regretted it as soon as I opened the box. The plastic water lid was broken even though the box wasn't damaged. Even the color of red was odd -- sort of rosey pink, instead of red. I do have to say that returns thru Amazon are AWESOME. They were fast and kept me informed via email of each step in the refund process. I bouth the Kitchen Aid thru Amazon and it is working out great."
4,Would be perfect,This is a great little coffee maker. Have order more expensive ones with the bells and whistles but they haven't lived up to their reputation. So I popped for this one. Relatively quiet..makes darn good coffee and quick too. The carafe is spill proof and bigger than my last one which was only 10 cups.It's a sturdy plastic with metal fronts as you see in the picture. Programmable or instant on. Easy clock set. It would be perfect if it just had a backlight on the clock. Big black numbers which helps otherwise a bit dark. But if you want good coffee for a good price this is your pot. Came fast and nicely packed for protection.
4,Love this coffeemaker,"A coffeemaker is generally a coffeemaker, and this is a coffeemaker. But above that, the basket is perfectly shaped for paper filters AND the carafe is beyond a doubt the best I've had on a coffeemaker. No spills or drips when pouring, and for me, that's a first. The red and stainless is great for my Tabasco/New Orleans inspired kitchen. Would have gotten five stars if it had a beep function when brewing cycle complete and about to turn off."
2,Small things fell apart after 6 months,"I think this coffee maker doesn't deserve to be priced where it is (~$50). After about 1 month, one of two little nubs that holds the carafe top in place broke off and now the top falls off when you tip the carafe to pour the last 1-2 cups out. All of the numbers and marking are gone from the side, so I have a sharpie mark on the handle for the approximate level that seems to get us 6 cups. More of an annoyance, but the top that flips up to load water and coffee is so big that I can't flip it up under our cabinets. I have to pull the whole coffee maker out to the edge of the counter top, load the water and coffee, close the lid, and then push the thing back under the cabinets so that the kids can't reach the hot surface.On the plus side, it makes coffee every time :)"
1,Cheap garbage/poor planning/bad coffee,"I always buy cheap coffee makers b/c they break no matter how much they cost but this is the worst and it's not broken. My cord is about 6 inches long requiring a 3-prong extenstion cord just to get the the basic plug right behind it on the wall. It collects so much moisture on the inside of the lid to the coffee chamber that everytime I open it I get a shower of water all over. The water chamber opening, although the funnel type should work beautifully, the hole is too small so you have to pour the water very slowly or it pours thru to where the coffee pot would be-if I wasn't pouring the water-makes a mess of a puddle...and the coffee is bitter. Same coffee I've used for 10 years in other makers but I can't get the right ratio to water to make it not bitter. I usually double the grounds b/c I drink it strong but no matter how little, it's bitter."
4,HAMILTON BEACH COFFEEMAKER,THE COLOR IS VIBRANT AND AGAIN CHINA MADE ITEMS .....THIS NEEDS TO STOP. OUR COUNTRY WAS ONCE CAPABLE OF MAKING THESE ITEMS WITH MUCH CARE AND NOW NOTHING. IT IS A NICE COFFEE POT I JUST HOPE IT LASTS LONGER THAN MY LAST COFFEE MAKER THAT BARELY MADE IT A YEAR.
2,"Does the basic, ... makes coffee.","The coffee maker is okay, but nothing spectacular. It's nice that we were able to find a red coffee maker again, which was the biggest attraction. The functions are very basic; there are no frills with this machine. It heats the water, runs it through the grounds, and keeps the coffee hot. There is no timer, which would be nice to keep from ""over-cooking"" the coffee after a little while. It was also quite disappointing that the water filter is not included with this product. The model/machine is really just the very basic. The red is a little more dull that the photo, too."
5,Great Coffee Maker,Easy to program and understand instructions. I have always found Hamilton Beach to be great at making coffee makers. This is my third one in over 20 years.
5,oh my.,"This coffee pot saves my life each morning. I love how i can set the timer to make the coffee without having to think about it. I love waking up to the smell of coffee, and plus, its RED! Who can go wrong with that?"
2,hamilton beach coffeemaker,"I have been using this coffee maker for a year. I like the design and coffeeis good. For the last month, it will not brew a pot without overflowing thefilter which results in grounds in the coffee. I have tried different filtersas well as coffees. I would not buy another Hamilton Beach!!"
5,Great flavor!,My dogs are a big fan of Wellness canned dog food and we just tried this flavor....no surprise...they LOVE it as they do most of the flavors.
4,"Fun, but sad","I really enjoyed this series, and I kept wondering when the next volume was coming out, but I couldn't find information about it anywhere. Finally, I stumbled on a fansite that claimed that CLAMP had abandoned the series. *sniffle* I hope this isn't true, but I thought that other people might want to be warned."
1,Its going to break!,it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces.look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good.
2,"The whole thing smacks of effort, man","I'll be brief.Here's the thing: just because something sounds (when being described in words) like a good idea doesn't mean it's going to sound (through headphones, speakers) good. I like Sergio. I respect hip hop. Together, it's now working.The attraction of Brazilian music, for me, is its effortlessness. It's seductive in its simplicity. So when you add some rapper who's totally in my face tossing off lyrics about ""empty 40 oz. bottles"" and ""Brazilian beauties with booties that wobble,"" it just doesn't work.So we have a forced, unnatural marriage of two distinct musical styles. They're fine on their own, but neither compliments the other on this album. And what's this -- ""yo, yo, yo, yo"" -- Will I Am rapping about people that sound hollow? Hmm.I give it ""2"" because it's in tune."
5,Mendes Continues to Grow as an Artist and Musician,"I was skeptical when I saw the number of guests on this album (it is sometimes an indicator that an artist is running dry and needs help), but this is a great recording. The identity of the music remains firmly with Sergio Mendes. From the opening notes of ""Mas Que Nada"" to the last sounds of ""Yes, yes, y'all"" Mendes crafts a clever, daring, and convincing work of art. This is truly ""Timeless""!"
1,SergioFan,"This is cd in my opinion is horrible. If you're a true diehard Sergio Mendes fan don't expect much out of this. The worse CD I've purchased this year. Maybe if the black eyed peas had been absent on this then it would've been a classic but as it is, it's JUNK! Don't waste your money!"
1,DISGUSTING!,"I guess it all comes down to... whether you like hip hop/rap or not. I actually HATE it and feel like the songs were completely ruined. I've liked Sergio Mendes since I was little and I almost cried when I heard this. I'm sure some people will enjoy it but if you don't like Black Eyed Peas and stuff like that, you will definitely not like this."
1,Beyond the white belt,I had the opportunity to spar Gary in the late 70's at a martial arts competition. I beat him then and I can beat him now. His whole philosophy on martial arts is disgraceful.
1,bleh.,"This book sucks. I'm sorry, but the whole thing is nothing but an over-written college essay. The author seems to have collected nothing but undescriptive, dry, unopinionated facts from other documents and simply thrown them together with no bearing on flow or feeling within the pages. The author jumps from one unrelated subject matter to the next, introducing names and events that have no bearing on the point of the chapter. There is continuous overuse of elaborate vocabulary as to keep focus on the author's wit & inteligence of such words, instead of simply focusing on describing the subject at hand. It is a perfect example of a waste of a tree."
3,Good Book - Hideous Editing,"Although this book has some great writing and is above average overall, I think the editing was downright awful. Throughout the book there are many syntax errors in examples, the formatting of examples change from page to page, the continuity stinks and naming conventions are all over the place. I'm a little surprised because I expected more from Wrox. They usually don't put out a product this bad. If you can correct all the errors in the examples and can understand the format changes, this is still a good book."
3,Written by illiterates?,"There are more errors in this book than I've ever seen in any other. Typos, inconsistencies... The code seems to be fine, but it's VERY distracting when you're reading to notice all these errors; and it's not a particularly good feeling to know that by making a purchase you're supporting sloppy publishing such as this. Wrox should really be embarrassed of this one."
1,Dissapointing,"I went online to order more clothes and figures for my daughter's collection and was dissapointed to find the original series has been discontinued. I showed my daughter the pictures of the ""new"" Madeline and Miss Clavel. She said, ""That is NOT Madeline!"" I'm so glad we purchased Miss Clavel, Madeline, and Pepito before the new line was introduced. I will hunt in the resale shops to see if I can find characters from the original line. They were so much cuter than these."
1,This doll isn't Madeline. What were they thinking?,"Looks like a cross between My Scene Barbie and Strawberry Shortcake. This is NOT what parents buying Madeline dolls want.This Christmas my plan was to buy my daughter a bunch of Madeline dolls, accessories and the house. I will no longer be doing that."
1,"Britney, Barbie, but not Madeline","The new generation of Madeline (& friends) dolls certainly do not convey the characters found within the classic Ludwig Bemelmans books. They are a very modern ""Britney Barbie"" version...a very disappointing version at that.The new Madeline dolls might be appropriate if Madeline was geared towards 13-year-old girls, but the stories (and dolls) are for girl's ages 3-8ish....the makers of Madeline ""sold out"". Shame shame!"
1,New Faux Madeline Boon for E-Bay,"I was horrified to realize that the ""real"" Madeline dolls were being discontinued and replaced with these Barbie-esque imposters. Why? My two daughters love Madeline and her adventures, but they wouldn't recognize this doll as Madeline at all, and isn't that the point? To enter into the world created in the award-winning books and the charming videos? The only local outlet here has already run out of the real Madeline dolls, and others seems to be having the same problem. Just try to successfully bid on Madeline dolls on E-bay. They're very, very popular items. I'd really rather buy the dolls the normal way - bring back the real Madeline!"
3,Very slight let down.,"Seemed a bit repetitive, but I think necessarily so, compared to prior book. Still enjoy the author and hismethods!"
3,Attention grabbing,"The Bermuda Triangle always grabs my attention, probably the reason I read this book and liked it. I like a weird story with a plot and a little romance (not too chickified)The writer puts a different spin on the old theory and done well to hold my attention."
3,"Entertaining, but...","I've read all 3 books in this series. Mostly, I liked them. Unfortunately, I happen to have a technical education. When somebody is measuring the nuclear reactor output in milliwatts (you normally measure your wristwatch's battery output in these units), a great deal of the story's charm is immediately lost for me. And there are a few such little annoying technical screwups scattered across the three books. Most readers probably won't notice them (which in and of itself is quite sad), but to me they certainly stuck out like so many sore thumbs. Mr. Donegan is a West Point graduate, according to the footnote in his books. One would expect a little more attention to detail from a person wuth such background. How would he like to read somebody else's description of a battle scene in which a warrior primes a flintlock on his M-16 with black powder? Wouldn't it kind of spoil the fun, even if the rest of the description is quite brilliant?"
3,Mixed bag,"The premise of these books is fairly interesting - there's some intelligence behind all of the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle and other similar areas. The author weaves in elements of the past, the future, high technology, and magical effects throughout the series. It takes a while to get used to it, but once you suspend disbelief you don't notice how arbitrary it seems.Pretty quick reading - strikes a balance between description and dialog. After the first book, I wasn't super interested in reading the next, but I wanted to see how it ended. This second book ends in a cliff hanger as well setting up for the third. I found that there was a lot of retelling of the first book in the second. That was a bit bothersome after reading the first, but good for those that missed the first book.There were a lot of misspellings throughout the book. Also a fair amount of grammar issues and some just plain typing mistakes. Distracting.Good beach reading."
2,Prrof read please!,"I've read many of Bob Mayer's books before and enjoyed them. I am half way through the Gate series and it's a good read BUT the proof reading is non-existent and it effects the readability of the text greatly in some places. I don't know if it's Mr. mayer's, fault or Amazon's bit it's not acceptable. It's so bad on occasions that it takes 3-4 read throughs to understand what's actually being written. I don't care that this is an ebook format, no-one paying for a book should have to accept that poor level of quality. You certainly wouldn't with a printed copy. Proof read before publishing please!"
5,Top Class Film,"With out a doubt,this would still have to go down as one of the all time greats.Bruce Campbell as ASH,you could not find any one better.With how old the film is and the budget they had for the film with out a doubt 11/10.To see it on DVD is the only way to see it.If you are an EVIL DEAD fan like my self only see it on DVD."
3,The movie that started it all...,"Fairly creepy at times, pretty funny at times, it was a decent movie. Before buying it, I had already seen Evil Dead 2 and 3... so without question I just bought this one for the complete trilogy. It doesn't compare to the 2nd and 3rd when it comes to laughs and entertaining scenes... but it definitely sets the foundation for the movies to come. It was funny at times, but wasn't intending to be... not that that necessarily matters. I think some of the aspects of the movie and the premise were pretty freaky, I just think the director didn't have a lot of money or something. Overall, I'd say this movie is worthing seeing at least once. It's sort of a classic, and definitely for Evil Dead fans."
5,Bruce Campbell is the man,Check out Bruce Campbell in his younger days. He was still an amazing actor. Everyone should have this in their horror repertoire. Good comic relief. Well done for an old horror film
3,Thought It Was Banned?,"I remember something about this movie being banned but they must have brought it back. It's real gory and real scary. There, does that answer your question?"
5,Evil...Evil...Evil,"This movie is superb. The scary atmosphere created here is excellent. Horror movie directors should learn from this masterpiece. PS. Anchor Bay version is good, but Elite version is better.Recommend highly."
2,Talant is not enough,"Sam Raimi knows how to make a good movie. If he had wanted to, he could have turned Evil Dead into a great horror movie. The opening scene is promising: a lonely car on a desolate road on its way to a cabin in the woods. Had Raimi only showed the same love towards the genre and the characters as he did in the Spiderman films... But, of course, he didn't. No love, only talant.There is a scene that shows the attitude of the film maker, where one of the character screams: ""Why are you torturing me like this?"" Obviously, that's a relavant question in many horror movies. That is if you're watching the movie, not if you're in it. The perspective in this film is rather distanced. Raimi is sitting in his horror movie sofa, laughing at the mysteries of the genre. When you're facing irrational evil, you don't ask ""why?"". There is only one thing to do. Just run, man. Just run."
4,GROSS MOVIE,"THIS MOVIE LOOKS LIKE IT WAS FILMED WITH A HANDYCAM.ASH IS THE SOLE SURVIVER AFTER AN ATTACK BY DEMONS.WHEN THE DEMON IS DYING ,OATMEAL FALLS OUT OF HIM."
4,Twistedly Fun,A true classic...a well-crafted horror movie that provides exhilarating laughter and screams. I will always appreciate any film that uses special effects like Evil Dead does.
3,quick and to the point,"if a film makes you jump, laugh, and a bit spooked then its done its job. this film has just enough gore a tiny bit erotic watch and see the tree chapter to see what i mean!!lots of gruesome make up effects and a decent picture to watch.the only thing missing is seeing the main demon, its left to your imagination. overall worth watching.zombie films still reign supreme though.enjoy your viewing"
4,don't possess me please,"the first time I saw this movie it got my adrenalin pumpedit delivers what you would expect(even from the title)it's somewhat predictable, but who cares! it has the gore thenasty and malevolent demons taking over the kids one by onea definite spookster of a gory chillerflickI recommend it, oh but not for little kids unless you want themto be freaked out all their life"
5,The development of the average man into hero,"First of all, the DVD transfer is excellent. Obviously somebody here really cared. I did like the development of Ashley the common man into Ash the hero. He is forced by circumstances to become the hero and he finally comes through. However, this is a pretty formulaic horror movie with lots of blood and guts and a splash of humor. A great job with a very low budget to work with and a fantastic 1st effort for people who have gone on to bigger and not necessary better things. For those unfamiliar with the movie, however, I would recommend that you rent it first to see if you really want to buy it."
3,*** 3.8 / 5 [B+],"In 1979, after gathering funding from showings of their film ""Within the Woods"", Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Robert Tapert set out to film a project originally titled ""Book of the Dead"" ... and later re-titled THE EVIL DEAD. THE EVIL DEAD is a surprisingly good Indie film, gathering inspiration from THE HILLS HAVE EYES, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (especially), and EQUINOX, and has a place deservedly among those as a milestone of horror films.Bruce Campbell stars as Ash, a college student who journeys to the woods for a fun-filled weekend in a cabin with his friends (phew). Soon, however, they learn something is lurking in the woods...and it wants them. Sexually, physically, and violently, if need be.Sam Raimi writes and directs this with surprising starter's mastering; Campbell is good, although he'd later be terrific in the sequels, EVIL DEAD II and ARMY OF DARKNESS. Joseph LoDuca also contributes a good (as well as inspired) score. Very cool!"
4,Bound in Human flesh and stamped by American hands?,"Outwardly, the limited edition book is a work of art. The appearance does give it the same movie quality ""bound in human flesh"" look, and the feeling of it is, well, interesting. Its even got an ear designed on the back to help it go that extra mile. Inwardly, I thought the picture recreations were done well, but the inking looks a bit too computer generated. This somewhat defeats the ""ancient quality"" in my mind. I also had a little bit of a problem with the book having an introduction in it (when I imagine Necronomicon Ex Mortis, I never saw it with an introduction in English) and a nice, fat declaration of copyright on the first pictorial page. And people wonder why they want to take us one by one. Still, I could overlook these minor things and still be very happy with the product because, outwardly at least, its the book of the dead."
5,Very very scary,"Don't think that because Evil Dead is a low budget horror film that it's not scary. Believe me folks- this movie is horrifying! I must have seen Evil Dead at least 50 times and it's just as scary as the first time I saw it. It's great that this film was given the treatment it deserved by being released on DVD. There are few movies that stick with you- the Evil Dead is one movie that will haunt you for years to come.I won't get into details of why this movie is so scary- I don't want to spoil it. Forget the digital special effects and ""Barbie and Ken"" type of characters and go out and buy this DVD. There aren't too many horror movies in the past and none in the present that even come close to the sheer horror of the Evil Dead."
2,"Great film, disapointing transfer","My special edition (the last DVD release) may not be letterbox (which sucks) but it does have a clear, crisp picture. I rented this before buying, man am I glad it saved me the money. The transfer is THX mastered, which means it's been filtered through a computer. Well it didn't work. The film is dark, often blurry and hard on the eyes. Sure there's a couple of nifty documentries on this disk, but the cheesy cover? Really, a collectable? It's lame, seriously. If you want a 16:9 copy, look for the new version without the $20.00 cover.But really, they need to do a restoration on this film and finally, finally give us a last (this is the 13th DVD version)version of this classic.Don't but the lame cover, or the crappy transfer."
3,Raimi gets reel,"This movie felt more like an excuse for Sam Raimi to try out film and makeup techniques, rather that try and make a cohesive horror film. There were some pretty impressive effects and camera moves for such a low budget film, and it clearly demonstrated Raimi has a future in the industry, but the film isn't very good otherwise. It was thin on plot and not the least bit frightening, just gore and effects. This has evidently made alot of horror fans happy considering the 5 star ratings, but not even Sam Raimi himself would give this 5 stars. He is surprised that the film has been so well received. Based on the reviews, I was expecting alot more. Despite flashes of brilliance, it is substandard. Raimi did get to show off his range of skills with reverse film, stop motion claymation, frame rate changes and practical effects, but that took center stage over the actual story. I would give the film 2 stars with a bonus star for the creativity and skill shown in a low budget first feature."
2,No new info here,"Dr Ward divided different ages into separate chapters and gives developmental characteristics for each age. The end of each chapter gives suggestions for interaction with your child. All of her suggestions were good, but are things we already do on a regular basis with our son.Her suggestions include:-Give him opportunities to play near other children.-Let him use large play equipment in the park.-Don't let your sentences get too long.-Repeat what your child says.Some of the information is repetitive, and many of the recommended activities are the same for each of the ages. Check it out of your library, but don't waste your money on it."
2,Poor quality,Book was in poor quality . Some Pages was torn and scribbled. Not worth buying as the information in this book is already been mentioned in many popular websites.
4,Very different,"Stephane is a creative, gentle soul who can't seem to disconnect from his sleep world while he's awake. When a girl named Stephanie moves in next door he seems to have met his soul-mate. Alas, Stephane's mental rambling sabotages the relationship before it can get started. He writes a strange note while half-asleep and sleep walks it across the hall to shove it under Stephanie's door. He only keeps his job because a co-worker covers for him, and that's only because the co-worker is desperately bored and Stephane's bizarre behavior is an amusing change. We get a glimpse into the world of a man with one foot in dreamland and one slipping out of reality.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,Disappointment,"Don't bother, kind of colorful but way too slow and sometimes painful to watch. Summation: guy gets a disappointing job, starts to day dream and sleep and cannot tell the difference between the two. Tries to get with a girl and it goes sour. Not uplifting enough for me sorry!"
4,If you rescue me...,"I'm not entirely sure whether i like this movie or not, but i often re-watch it for the feeling it gives me.I really like Michel Gondry and Gael García Bernal, but i'm still unsure about this movie.It's easy for me to pin-point specific scenes that I love, however; it's hard for me to comment on the movie as a whole.I give this movie 4 stars, though. Maybe because i'm just a sucker for independent films.. or maybe I truthfully liked this movie. I'm not entirely sure."
3,adequate,"This was a decent movie. The plot was all over the place though. Maybe I would like it better if I watched it again. It seemed disjointed though, like a David Lynch movie. There was no real conclusion and no explanations of the interaction between reality and fantasy. Don't get me wrong, I love tangential movies, like those of Charlie Kaufman, but this one wandered a little too much. I don't regret seeing it, but I don't know if I would watch it again."
4,Indie movie for those who like deep thoughts.,Very multi layered thinker type movie. Artistically photographed and a pleasure to watch more than once as you glean new things from it.
1,ehh,dry read; gave it to my brother who is a geologist. i think he uses it as a paperweight. sorry to the author.
5,"6 comprehensive hours in the life of Jesus Christ, the Lord and Saviour of the world!","WHY is this a great collection to have? What's so good about it?I'll tell you! First of all, you want to get the 3 DVD set. Each DVD is 2 hours long, broken up into 4 30-minute episodes. Each episode is theme-oriented, with positive messages that relate very well to the world today, and the world long ago. The musical composition is superb. The actual film may be old (1951-1957), but it is well-acted. The entire film is very true to the Bible, and with all of this combined, I was glued to my TV.If you feel you want to get closer to Jesus; if you feel you need to know Jesus more; if you feel someone you know needs Jesus; or, if you'd like to talk to someone about Jesus, and don't really know how, this is the way!God bless you all...Angelo"
4,oversize,This shirt is as advertised--highly visible and light weight. It seems to breathe well and wicks moisture. It would be useful for commuting by bicycle. My only complaint is the sizing. I generally wear a large T-shirt but this is huge. I think I would be swamped in a medium and Boston does not offer a small. I may use it as an over shirt for commuting in Winter darkness as the reflective stripes are much wider and more reflective than those on my jacket.Shipping was very fast and the product arrived before I expected it.
4,very much worth it but...,"I bought this pair because it was on sale in Amazon and find it extremely comfortable BUT the paste on the insole comes off and peels. It becomes very irritating when you walk a lot because it kinda gets crumpled and creased in the innersole. I have to have it re-glued and straightened out. You'd think with a brand like Geox, the shoe would be perfect. Other than that minor flaw, its very comfortable and your feet really feels fresh. I'd buy another pair anytime."
4,Not the same size as Weebles in the box sets,These Weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets.
5,Storybook Weebles,"My children played with Weebles, and now they are being used by my grandchildren. I got two sets of the Little Red Riding Hood characters, and it is easy to recognize the characters. My two small grandchildren were each delighted with them! And I found that Weebles still ""wobble, but they don't fall down."" Ha! Ha!"
5,Awesome Grill,"Purchased this grill for camping with a pop-up and to take to the Nascar races, it is an awesome grill does just what it is advertized to do. I really like the grease trap on the back of the grill that collects the grease doesn't run down into the grill to start flare ups. Thanks Amazon could not purchase locally and it arrived just as promised and in excellent condition.UPDATE: Used this grill for an 8 day camping trip with family, large enough to cook for 16 people,cooked every meal on it with no problems, easy clean up even after cooking chicken and sitting over night. Even light weight enough that I picked it up and loaded it in the back of my truck. Will purchase again if the need arises to do so."
4,Not Bad,A pretty good brief history with a good lesson in terms and trade craft.Has some good event history.
4,Loves all Blue's,All Blue's are great...well at least my 2 yeard old thinks so. Although not his favorite but still it will keep his attention.
2,Didn't work for us.,"Read the book probably 5 times, charted temps, used ovulation predictor kits. Now having my 3rd boy. I'm very happy with my baby, but just wanted to add my 2 cents that it didn't work for us.Good Luck!"
2,Didn't work,We decided it was time for us to start our family and both wanted our first to be a boy. We bought this book some time ago and followed it perfectly. However we have just learned it didn't work and are expecting our daughter in a few months. She ofcourse will be loved and cherished.I have read a great deal more since then and it seems there is little if any scientific merit to this theory - some scientists even claiming to have disproven it. If it works for you then you were just lucky. In the end it's just a 50-50 shot.Good luck.
5,How to choose the sex of your baby,ABSOLUTELY WORKS IF YOU FOLLOW THE METHOD PRECISELY (I am two for two). Before reading this you need to read Dr. sheldon Cherry's How to get pregnant. If you do not chart your basile body temperature exactly for several months-the method will not work. I had my first child at age 38 and only had to try TWICE -BUT I was a scientist and charted my temp for three months before trying. Ditto with my second child. AT age 40 I conceived after only two attempts. One boy and one girl.Both books work if you are dedicated to following them. Good luck.
5,updated,This is just a follow up to my previous review of this book. I did deliver my 1st son on sept 6th 1998 his due date. using my charts i was able to determine ovulation using Dr Shettles method after only 3 cycles.
4,Try the method it worked for us it might work for you,"After 2 boys, we really wanted a girl, so we read the book and followed the basic suggestions and we had a girl. It is not methods, but God who actually gave us a little girl. But if these things have worked for other people than it is worth a try. Even though we really wanted a girl, if we were given a boy we would have taken him too. We will probably try the method one more time for one more girl and if we are given a boy we will be thankful!"
5,I found the book clear but hard to get a girl.,"The book is clear, however, having a girl is very difficult. It is nearly impossible if you can't pinpoint your ovulation. I know that I am ovulating b/c I have 2 healthy sons but have also had 2 misscariages since. We are now considering visiting some of the clinics that perform sperm separation. Still trying, Atlanta, GA"
2,Better books on this topic are available.,"...If you really want to try to control the sex of your baby, there are more informative books out there. Not just for gender determination, but for all around knowledge of the feminine functions of your body, read The Billings Method. It covers everything from the early years to menopause. After becomming discouraged in an attempt to become pregnant, I went online looking for answers. I ordered and read The Billings Method. We became pregnant with my very next cycle. The Billings Method also covers the theory of determining the sex based on conception to ovulation timing. What I want to know is, if any of our theories, especially the chinese calander, are accurate, why do we still end up with so many girls being orphaned in China while their parents again try their luck at getting the one child they are allowed to have to be a boy?"
3,puzzling,"I finished this book last night and I'm not sure what I think of it. Seeing as I'm much closer to Thisby's age than to Katharine's, I was much impressed with the author's insights into youth, maturity, and family, and I think that the opportunity to see into the mind of a mother has helped me understand my own parents. I also liked the way she tied in both Shakespeare and classic movies, and the skillful drawing of the character of Quince. However, the story was definitely flawed. Huge leaps in time gloss over some of the most important parts of Thisby/Katharine's story, characters enter abruptly and are just as unceremoniously forgotten about, and symbols fly about without any hint as to their meanings. Doud clearly intends for us to read This Body more than once, but I'm not sure I want to spend the time, even with the promise of more of her lovely insight awaiting me. Sorry, but the intelligent Ms. Doud just isn't a masterful storyteller just yet."
1,Could be good. But it's not.,"The characters are boring and annoying, the plotline tepid, and the emotional resonance nil."
3,Great Concept,"This is a GREAT concept, but the execution left a little to be desired. It was a little slow for me and I ended up doing a lot of skipping around and in the end not finishing the book. I am used to more fast paced urban fantasy novels, so it was also a little out of my element. As I said, the concept was interesting hence my picking it up. I know, this review is not much help, but it is an honest opinion."
5,Beautiful and practical!,"Finally, a book that actually takes the phrase 'small apartment' literally! Organized by square footage and featuring a wide variety of styles, plans, layouts, and schemes, this book is an inspiration. Plus it takes into account that not every city dweller has a million dollars with which to decorate. There is an emphasis on DIY and innovative uses of non-decorative items as functional decor, both of which are a relief to me as I am a person who lives simply and paycheck-to-paycheck. And the book is sharp-enough looking I plan to reserve a space for it on my extra-small, extra-chic coffee table!"
5,Highly recommended,"This is a great book, about real people. It just shows how a small space can be just as grand as a mansion, given some imagination and effort. The ideas presented in the book are ideas that you and I can accomplish quite easily and within our budgets too!I've gotten a few ideas from this book and it's made my life a lot more pleasant for the experience."
3,Cool Pictures,"I really liked the photography, and weight/size/texture of this book, but I didn't get any ideas that I hadn't already thought of for my small space. It's basically a book that shows who lives where, and how they live...which is cool.Some of the spaces were so small there wasn't really anything you could put in them besides a dresser, a bed, and a counter with some dishes on top, and a laptop next to it.Most of the designs are created with items that one would have in their place if they were 18-26 years old. The ideas appeared as having second-hand furniture, knick knacks they had as a kid, miscellaneous art bought from a homeless guy on the street...which is all good, but if you've moved on to the next stage of your life, I don't think this book would be very helpful, but would make a nice coffee table book.At most, it was visually entertaining, but didn't spark my imagination."
2,Flip Through at the Bookstore but Don't Buy,"I didn't find the contents of this book inspiring enough to justify the $23.10 price tag. To its credit, the photographs are well-done, and you will start to think differently about making small spaces work. But I personally didn't walk away with any ideas for my small space, and I found the decorative styles of the apartment-dwellers interesting but not suitable for my lifestyle. A lot of the apartments featured are 2nd homes for people, so their apartments serve more as places to sleep rather than a dire need to live in <500 sq. feet. There's very little to no ""how to"" in this book, from furniture arranging tips to how to save space to how to make your life fit into 1 or 2 closets."
1,Another coffee table book,"Don't buy this book if you want hints and tips to making your small space bigger. Do buy this book if you want to flip through it once and then leave it on the coffee table for visitors to look at. The book is beautiful to look at but for the price tag I would have preferred an art book. There is a lack of people who don't work in design fields that are featured in this book, giving the book a feel of ""look at what others can do, but don't think you can""."
3,Living Large in Small Spaces,"Although I was not overwhelmed with inspiration, I liked the set-up of this book. The spaces are grouped by square footage complete with pictures of all areas of the space and a floor plan so that you can visualize how the spaces fit together. I also liked the fact that there were various design styles. However, I could not visualize myself living in the majority of the spaces displayed in this book. The majority of the homes displayed were homes of designers and artists. Since I myself am not a designer or an artist, I could and would not begin to design like what was displayed in this book."
2,Disappointing . . .,"Although the photos are lovely and utilize small space very well, I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for more than photos -- one quick look and and I passed it on to a friend."
1,expensive for how long they last...,"I bought two sets of this for two cars. One bulb out of each set burned out within 12 month and 15 month. Sylvania rep stated that they are only expected to last 12 month. Also ""OSRAM SYLVANIA, Inc. does not have an across-the-board warranty for our products."" I would goto another brand."
1,Poor lifetime,"My factory lights lasted about two and a half years before one burnt out, so I replaced both with a set of these bulbs. While I did like the High Beam performance over the stock, low beam performance was mediocre at best, and the lifetime was abysmal. When the first set went after only 3 months, I thought perhaps it was a recent cold snap that might have had an effect. But both bulbs burned out within a week of each other.I got a second set, thinking perhaps it was just bad luck/unfortunate weather, but that set also had one bulb burn out within 3 months, so I just went and got a standard bulb set, from a different manufacturer."
1,Quick to Fail,"Although this bulb provides excellent night time field of view, I have replaced the first after just 6 months of use.COST TO RUN THIS BULB: over 2 dollars a month.Sylvania Osram refused to honor replacement of the bulb.Look for a different bulb."
3,Lovely Item...Misleading Product Specifications,"Love the fixture, elegant and different than your average ceiling fan/overhead light. However the product specifications listed on Amazon are misleading and Amazon choose to not take responsiblity for the mistake. Specifications state ""Number of Lights: 1"", a light is NOT included. Once brought to Amazon's attention they said I was to contact Hunter (manufacturer) and inquire about the product specifications. Wait a minute, didn't I purchase the product from Amazon, isn't Amazon responsible for the mistake? I guess not!"
3,Just so so,I wasn't as impressed or found things I wanted to make with this Campbells book as with some of the other ones with similar titles. It is OK.
5,Phil & Bryan Lynch make a great combo!,Bryan Lynch on trumpet and Phil Woods on alto saxophone make this an enjoyable listening experience. Great tunes. They especially do Harlem Nocturne and Walkin' Thing well. Backed by a great rhythm section. I just can't wait to see him Live myself!
2,Not Much To It,"As a fan of Kreskin, I expected to be reading some solid material that would really get my mind going. It appears Kreskin sent some letters out and quickly reprinted what ever reply he could get just to get something on the market to sell. -- L. Betz"
5,Wonderful for all ages!,"I took my four-month-old to storytime at the local children's bookstore, and this was one of the books read. I fell in love with it instantly. The illustrations are so well done and the colors are gorgeous. The white rabbit's curiosity make him a great character. I'll be sharing this book with my son for a long time to come."
5,Cristian's versitility is incredible!,"This album is one for the ages. I generally prefer to listen to large ensemble jazz, but when I bought this CD, I couldn't turn it off! I first heard Christian when he was on Maynard's band and I was absolutely taken back by his virtuousity. Here is one of the nouveau musicians on the scene today that everyone should keep an ear open for. Besides his great techinique on the ivories, his writing and arranging skills are beyond words! Just listen to his absrtact variation on IVE GOT RHYTHM (a featured tune on the album). Its perfect for today's jazz listeners. The balad, HERE'S THAT RAINY DAY is beautifuly done as well. It showcases Christian's versitlity once again through his romantacism on the piano. Snaps also to John and Peter for outstanding bass and drum work. Truely a highlight to the ensemble!"
1,I just wasted my money!,"This French farce could have been an exceptional erotic film, however they chose to go soft on the beatings and sex scenes. Instead they have ""hippie"" looking people with huge crotch bushes dancing around the fire someplace in the (Spanish) desert! Nothing remotely erotic or exceptionally worth watching. The sex scenes are really lame as you never see any body parts of the men, and rarely is there anyone doing anything remotely daring or exciting. There are some nude women dancing around in various sequences, but when the big moment comes to brutally ""whip"" the star, its a phony whipping sequence and they show nothing! I highly recommend ""The Story of O"" or ""The Image"" as alternative films of this genre that really deliver the goods!"
3,A Tale of a Young Girl's Encounter With Anti-Semitism,"Lipman's heart is in the right place telling the tale of a ""restricted"" summer resort in Vermont that does allow Jewish guests. But the way the plot is worked out and justice prevails is pedestrian and contrived. In essence the message is love conquers all."
3,Starts great - finishes flat,"When I started reading this book I really liked the great character prtrayals, and the heroine's personality -- she didn't take no for an answer and didn't buckle to outside pressures -- getting to the heart of things without losing faith in herself. She reminded me of the tenacious heroine who never lost her sense of humor in ""The Secret Life of Bees"".The second part of the book folded like a collapsed souffle -- too much going on -- too many wandering conversations -- a rich seasoning of personalities lost in a jumble of mis-matched flavors."
2,What was the point....?,"What an utter disappointment. After an interesting beginning, I have to admit that I struggled to read the end of this book because I kept looking for that something that was promised. In the words of my daughter, yucky. The characters became flat and unbelievable. Ms. Lipman had the beginnings of some very interesting characters yet chose to develop none of them."
4,Great ialog...you'll want to read this in one sitting,"Ms. Lipman's book is highly entertaining, and will make you want to continue reading and wanting more. The characters are very likable and the story-line interesting if not fully believable. This book makes me definitely want to read the rest of her work!"
4,Quick read,"This is a nice little book that illuminates another area of racism in the history of the US. It comes together a bit too neatly for me, but the characters are well written and I would consider it good summer reading."
5,"My first, and not my last!","I was looking for a light summer read and I sure found it. I'll be reading all of her novels now, I'm sure."
2,Read it through your local library,"Margolis has a good premiss on the impact of habits of mind on our ability to perceive flaws in current theory and practice. However this information has been known to behavioral scientists for decades. Like Kuhn he has taken well known human traits and spun them into a ""new"" discovery. Old hat to people working in organizational change. The real annoyance with this book, apart from having paid for it, is that the main thesis is detailed in the first 29 pages and the next 200 pages give you more detail than you would ever wish on early chemistry and ptolemic astronomy. Get it from the library, if you must, my copy's going to the second hand book store for a refund to minimize expenses."
1,Stale,"I'm really hoping I just got a bad sample, because this thing tasted like jalapeño flavored vacuum dust. The color looks so unnatural when you pour it out that you wonder if it glows in the dark.I love jalapeños and I will give this another try, just to see if it is really that bad. For now, though, one star is more than enough."
5,Another masterpiece!,"I was not surprised to find that the latest CD, ""I'll Leave The Light On"", is yet another amazing effort from Beth Hart. As her previous cd releases show, her talent is beyond belief. She has an astonishing voice that can make you wonder how it's coming out of someone so petite. I read a few of the other reviews, and all who have only purchased this one...you should definitely pick up her first CD ""Immortal"" as well as her second CD ""Screamin' For My Supper"". I was introduced to her music 5 and half years ago when she opened for a band I love. I rushed out and bought her CD! It's sad that it took this long for more people to find out about her. Praise is long overdue for Beth Hart. She is AMAZING!!!!"
5,Harry Potter in French,"This is the french language version of ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban."" My daughter wanted one, and Amazon had it."
4,Creating Sancturary for clients and counselors,This book is special because it addresses clients who have been damaged by poor counseling and life traumas and counselors who have almost as much traumas as the clients. There are many counseling books out there but this book is wholesome.
3,HOT LIPS HOT LEGS,"THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE PLAYBOY DVDS/VIDEOS AT ARE ON THE MARKET, THIS ONE IS TRUTH IN ADVERTISING, THE GIRLS ARE VERY SEXY AND MOST HAVE INCREDIBLE LONG LEGS AND GREAT ""BEHINDS"" WHILE SOME OF SCENES ARE AVAILABLE ON OTHER PLAYBOY DVDS THIS IS A GOOD COLLECTION THAT STANDS UP FAIRLY WELL (MY FAVORITE IS THE ONE WITH THE TWO GIRLS CLEANING THE POOL)RANDY"
2,there is only one girl with legs,Majority of the girls are handicapped or paralized and they are titless i have had more fun watchin paint dry!
5,The time is right for young women to read this book.,"In a time when it is so awkward, if not impossible, to share thoughts with girls who are facing the transition to being a woman, it is wonderful that this book is available. The authors have filled this book with insights, mostly from women with a broad spectrum of viewpoints, but it also contains messages from men to the young women in their lives. I believe that this is a book which will be treasured by my entire family for many years to come."
1,Bad sign,"It's a bad sign when the publisher of a book on language doesn't seem to know the difference between ""it's"" and ""its."""
3,Good but aged,"I got this book in may 2008. Its ok, but very aged and doesn't cover the newer Garageband. I'd wait till a new one comes out"
1,SUCKS!!!,"This is a good idea but that's all it is, an idea. This thing looks good but doesn't work worth a CRAP. Well, it does heat up but not enough to warm ANYTHING and none of my coffee cups fit. You have to have a TINY coffee cup for it to fit; my girlfriend let me use one of hers to try this thing out and it gets hot (if by 'hot' you mean barely warm), just not hot enough to do any good. You can touch the thing and it doesn't even burn. Don't waste your money."
5,Heavenly.....,"This fragrance is fresh not fruity. Wonderful for using in the bath after a hard day at work, or a hard day with the kids."
5,A Timeless Classic,"This is when actors acted, left you on pins and needles for the next episode. Kept your imagination running wild. It gave you something to talk about. It is in a class by itself."
3,What do you have to loose?,"OK, this is not the best movie ever made, but it's really not that bad. I really liked the locations and the soundtrack. Check this one out if you're a Christina Applegate fan or if you've ever been to Tybee Island."
5,JT,"This was a really swinging band but came along about four years too late. Tea made a bad career move when he signed a lengthy contract with Paul Whiteman that didn't allow him to leave until 1939. Had T started this band in 1935 instead of staying all that time with Whiteman, he would have been a hot item at the dawning of the swing era. Instead, by '39, this hot style was on the way out and the slower fox trot style was now dominating by Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller, and Benny Goodman. The liner notes say Tea lost $40,000 trying to keep this band going___a tremendous sum of money for that time. There are some slower ballad tunes too, with Tea and Kitty Kallen vocals; a gal who would gain stardom with Harry James four years later. Terrific music from a band that unfortunately was short-lived because it's time had come and gone before it got a chance to succeed."
3,Sounds like a very lovely woman...,"Liz Perle sounds like a very lovely woman, but I didn't learn anything about finances reading her book.She has an easy-going, approachable style, and I was interested in her own journey.I think the problem with the book, for me, was that it tried to be a memoir and a non-fiction financial advice guide. Unfortunately, it didn't succeed as either.Ms. Perle's story is interesting, and I would have been far happier if the whole book was about her. The studies, stats, and quotes from famous people only detracted from the book.I bought it because our local paper gave it a glowing review, but I might have bought it at a bookstore based on the first page. Liz can really write a great hook!I was very curious to hear her story, and kept reading to find out what happens to her and her son. As I said, if the whole book was about her I would have been happier."
1,Disappointing,"I was intrigued by this book and found some of it interesting. The useful part of the book are some of the anecdotes and stories. However, much of the book I found to be disorganized and disjointed. Also, while a woman myself, I didn't quite see the point (marketing?) why to constrain the book to women. After all, many of us have mates and relatives and friends and money conflicts and issues with those folks. The author lacks authority and credentials in the finance realm. I have to question some of the premises of the book as well. The biggest is that women don't take an interest in investing. That certainly isn't the experience of myself and many, many women that I know!I bought and read a copy of Mind Over Money by Eric Tyson and greatly preferred that book over this one."
3,Gets you thinking,"If this book did anything it was that it got me thinking about my life and how I was going to pay for the future. There are no answers in this book, if that is what one is looking for. Perel makes us realize that the only one who will look after you is you. There is no white knight. I like the author got married in my 30's so I kind of already knew there was not really a prince. For me there was a companion. No one has your best interest at hand better than you so keep your eyes open."
2,Meh,"I couldn't get through this book. I was forcing myself to continue since I paid for it. I finally decided life is too short and I shouldn't waste my time; it's now being used as a coaster on my nightstand. I, like some other reviewers, could not relate to the author. I do not think a man will just take care of me. I also thought this book might help me gain insight on how I relate to money, but it certainly didn't. I would not recommend this book."
2,expected better,"I ordered the blender with the seperate food processor. After using the blender once, washing it,and after putting all parts back together to use again, the separate rubber gasket leaked from the bottom when I tried to make a smoothie. I followed directions, re-tightened the bottom blade assembly, and again it leaked!. Had to tighten it more each time I washed and used it. Pretty diassappointing to say the least. When I blend fruits for a smoothie, they don't really get as smooth as they should .Was also not happy that the food proceesor doesn't chop like one that stands alone. Suggest getting a blender with a non removable gasket."
5,My Daughter Loves This Blender/Food Processor Combo,I gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift. She loves it. It is stylish & easy to operate and chops/blends as you expect it to. Good purchase. You won't be disappointed.
2,Makes lot of noise and did not serve our purpose,"We were looking for a blender/processor that would puree tomatoes, onions at a very fine level. Unfortunately, this product did not meet our expectations and we returned it back. Moreover, the blender makes a lot of noise that it can wake up anyone from sleep. The attachments are sturdy and look very robust. A good product for people who do not have any issues with noise...."
3,Hamilton Beach 52654,It does the job now. I have to wait and see how long blades will stay sharp. That is key for me. I always used Osterizer Blenders. It lasts a long time. This is my first Hamilton Beach purchase.
3,Old fashioned,"Although I believe in traditional values AND courtship, this book mistakenly leads you to believe you have to bend over backwards and WAIT and be PATIENT to EARN a man's love. I don't buy that unless you want a luke warm marriage or relationship. What I did think was beneficial was understanding a lot is not personal and how to keep a level head during the dating process. This book just doesn't do a great job of weeding out men who are wrong for you and may even encourage you to stay with a commitmentphobe for years."
2,NO FURNITURE HOW CAN YOU PLAY,EVEN THE GREATEST IMAGINATION CAN GET BORED WITH NO PHYSICAL PROPS. HOW CAN YOU SELL A DOLLHOUSE WITH LITTLE TO NO FURNITURE IN IT OR AVAILABLE TO PURCHASE! THIS IS A DISGRACE.. MY DAUGHTERS IN LAW BOUGHT 2 FISHER PRICE HOUSES FOR MY GRANDAGUHTER'S OWN HOUSE AND ONE FOR HERE WHERE SHE STAYS 3-4 TIMES A WEEK. MY GRAND DAUGHTER'S FIRST COMMENTS WERE--? WHERE THE BEDS? WHERE'S THE BATH TUB?? THEY BOTH PURCHASED THE ITEMS IN TOYRUS AND WAS TOLD OTHER FURNITURE WOULD BE IN TO FILL THE HOUSES. WENT BACK AFTER CHTISTMAS AND WAS TOLD NO PIECES WERE AVAILABLE....WHAT DO WE DO NOW!!
5,Can you say AWESOME?!!!!,"This is the best toy we've ever bought for our daughter, Rachel. She is a very creative 3 year old and she and I sit together for hours playing 'house'. As a mother and toy enthusiast for my child, I can honestly say that Fisher Price has outdone themselves on this one. I agree that it could have come with more furniture, and that it is difficult to find other sets for the other rooms, but within one week we found enough furnture sets on ... and On Amazon to do the job. The house is jam packed with goodies now. Rachel and I are still finding new things every day that make us say 'wow' !!!! Thanks Fisher Price, we love it!!!!"
3,"Great, BUT FURNITURE DISAPPEARED BEFORE CHRISTMAS","I read the reviews on here and bought the dollhouse for my 2 1/2 year old daughter in November for Christmas. One of the reasons I decided to buy this dollhouse is that it had (AT THE TIME) so many rooms and accessories listed on AMAZON I gave everyone ideas on what to get her to go with it. Problem is: My Mom ordered stuff for it that never came and now we have no furniture. There are some on EBAY, but like someone else said, expensive, and often not the furniture that makes sounds."
2,Where are the furnishings?,"I bought this doll house for my daughter over a year and a half ago and now that she turned three she can actually appreciate it. Her appreciation will have to wait, however, because the furnishings for it are absolutely unavailable anywhere. Fisher Price customer service reps have given me conflicting information. It is really frustrating to buy a doll house and fear that by the time the furnishings are available, my daughter may outgrow it."
1,extremely lousy transfer,"I love Chabrol, but these 8 DVDs (which include some of his best-known films) are an utter disgrace. The transfers are so low-grade that the images squirm and squiggle up and down. Even the scratchiest videotapes are more watchable than these. I feel completely ripped off. Even more, I'm furious that a great director like Chabrol should have to suffer in the hands of unscrupulous merchants like the ones responsible for these abominations. AVOID!!!"
1,I didn't buy it on Amazon but it is junk,all the numbers wore off the dials after the first month.Now it is useless.A real piece of garbage.Stay away from this one.
5,"Bible came so quick, like it was delivered by angels",This bible was ordered and delivered so quickly. I was very pleased as I was giving this as a gift. Thanks Amazon for your great service.
2,Nail polish not very good,The book has great ideas for nail designs. However the nail polish itself is not the same colors as on the cover and they come off when you wash your hands. They should have included real nail polish!
3,"great book, poor quality polish","I realize the aim is for washable polish to include with this set - but quality was not good with included polish. We used the book and 'real' nailpolish to make the great designs. Overall, the book had great tips/designs, but use with real polish under supervision (the kids will need help, anyway)."
1,This is a misleading title,I learned nothing about the body language of horses that I didnt already learn from being around them for 2 weeks.
4,Great CD and Great Live!,"I have seen and Heard The Coming Of Her Music! Her Voice is Excelent and her Talent is outstanding! She Has Such a great sound and her band is Fantastic! She is great even live! A lot of bands need the studio to sound good, but with her it is the other way, she makes the studio sound good! Wether its in a Club or A small radio station, She sounds Great!"
4,Genuinely entertaining amd informative. A feel good book.,"Unless you yourself have ever played the weight game it might be alittle less interesting reading. Delta puts it on the line about the highs and lows of feeling good and bad and is quite entertaining while doing it. She's frank and honest about this part of her life and doesn't mince words. Also, her beauty tips are able to be used by us all, not just those with extra money laying around. And the time to chase down the ingredients. Such a sense of humor is a good thing nowadays too! I found her honesty about how she lost and kept the weight off refreshing. And every real size woman knows just what she is talking about, in one way or the other. Keep up the good work Delta!!!"
1,Book Purchase,"After a month went by, I contacted this seller by email as provided by Amazon. They responded by saying they would send the book in about a week.Well, I give up.. no book still, purchase date 12/29.. It now Feb 11th.I would just like a refund. Word to the wise, don't do business with this seller.Upset in Glen Allen, VA"
4,Liked this one a lot,"If you're a fan of Dot Frank and/or books centered around South Carolina's Lowcountry, you'll probably like this book as much as I did. The characters are believable and amusing and the book's story line held my interest from start to finish. Shem Creek is a winner and I recommend it highly."
3,Just o.k.,"It was a somewhat boring read after ""Porch Lights"" which was my favorite book of the summer. It was hard to stay interested."
4,"not the best, but still is ok","I have read the first book and I am a little disapointed with Slave Ship. The author doesn't portray some key characters well and if you have read Tales of the Bounty Hunters, you would see that some of Jeter's characters do not coincide with the book. I am sorry to say that he strayed from the focus on Fett and this is not one of the normal think your way through the plot type of book. Overall, this book is good, but not great."
3,The best bad guy in the galaxy is back in action.,"Picking up at the exact moment The Mandalorian Armor concluded, Slave Ship has Boba Fett (now fully recovered from his partial digestion in the Sarlacc's gut) skipping over the dangling knots of the conspiracy he helped set in motion many years before. Just as was the case in the trilogy's opening chapter, Slave Ship jumps between past (shortly after the destruction of the Death Star that concluded A New Hope) and present (roughly parallel with Return of the Jedi) as author K.W. Jeter takes us on an intimate tour of the gutter of the galaxy. While it certainly is a smartly written tale, the series lacks a sympathetic character to root for. The reader simply watches nasty people do nasty things to each other for several hundred pages, and Boba Fett is far too robotic in his characterization to seem to warrant a three book arc. Nonetheless, fans will gobble it up and ask for more."
2,Good idea ruined by bad writing,"When I first heard there was a series about bounty hunters, I was excited. I read the first book, then read this. I was thinking maybe this would be better than the first. Well, it wasn't. Jeter still obsessed over barves and Standard Time Parts. If Standard Time Parts were so freaking standard, why is this the only book with them. Not to mention the fact Jeter wrote Xisor was alive in the NOW section and dead in the THEN. And then there is Bossk. ""Hi I'm Bossk, the retarded Trandoshan bounty hunter. I think I can kill the best bounty hunter in the galaxy on his ship! After all, my father was smart so I must be too!"" And the whole renegade stormtrooper incident? How much sense does it make for Palpatine to pay millions of credits, at minimum, for a person he has no problem with? And then Boba Fett is such a BARVE that he totally betrayed Zuckuss for no reason. DO NOT READ THIS. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was a good idea"
2,Just as bad as its predicessor,After reading this and Medalorean Armor I can say that these are a mockery to the Star Wars universe. They got the charactors all wrong. Bosck is not a fool and niether was Dengar. The only Redeaming quality to this books is Balancesheet who I found to be a fananating charactor. Jeter should never write another Star Wars book so he can't do any more damage.
1,Not worth the 6 bucks!,"This toy is a nightmare to assemble. We got half way through putting the head together before realizing that the neck and jaw were not moving (see new sticker comment below). If you want to torture someone's parents, this is the gift."
3,A fine sayonara,"Back on Pop Llama, they label where they debuted in the late '80s, the Bellingham, WA popsters' formal full-length swan song --they have occasionally reformed and pseudo posthumously released an EP, a box set and some other odds and ends-- includes a few of their finest tunes. Among them: ""Somehow Everything"", ""You're the Beautiful One"", ""Friendship of the Future"", and ""Every Bitter Drop""."
3,Success,Success being the Posies 1998 release and their 5th studio album was yet another album that I took a chance at after seeing it in my local library. The sound is straight forward rock music with generic lyrics and sound. All the lyrics are included in the booklet. Throwaway is a great track but many tracks sound similar. 3/5.
3,Good For the Passionate Player,"It's a worthwhile read if you love playing poker. There's plenty of tall tales, crazy hands, and interesting psychology. However, Holden's style drags a bit in the later chapters, and his dry English prose is a bit dull at times. Overall, a good gift for the literate poker nut."
2,A bit pricey,"I don't doubt that this is a good book. However, there is simply no rational way to to ask almost $150 for a modern language-learning book."
4,Very cute,We have adopted a Vietnamese child and are exposing him to the language. At the suggestion of a Vietnamese friend we bought the Sing and Learn Vietnamese book and CD. Our son loves the vocals and the music. My Vietnamese friend said the singer is very popular in the Vietnamese community.
4,Wood Shop Safety video,"I would recommend it as one small piece of what an instructor needs for the unit on safety. Very engaging, especially since it uses student actors for the parts. Price could use some adjusting(cheaper), as the video is short(13 minutes) and amaturishly packaged(lacked a dvd menu). Other than the lack of the dvd menu, it was well done and covered the basics of behavior in the woodshop..."
2,Parents Beware,"I have long been a Gloria fan along with my two daughters aged 14 and 16. I always encouraged my daughters to listen to Gloria because her music had decent lyrics and I believed Gloria to be a good role model for young girls. But when I watched this new video with my daughters, I was shocked! This music video definitely breaks from Gloria's previous clean-cut image. Many of the scenes in the opening song, Oye, are lewd and crude, and at least one scene is suggestive of oral sex. This is a shame because the video is otherwise very good. If your kids insist on watching the video, I suggest having the fast-forward button ready."
1,f--,doesn't work with an air hogs havoc heli generation 2009-2010. Even after gluing the rotor to the shaft the heli was uncontrollable.
1,Rotors,The replacement rotors look good online however they are very cheap and flimsy. They don't hold the weight of the helicopter. Also one package came broken which shows the quality of the product.IMHO buy a new helicopter that has a warranty or replacement parts that are supplied by an actual store.Waste of money
1,Blade doesn't work.,Blade didn't work as described. Wouldn't lift helicopter off ground. Had to send back for refund.
2,"for veg, not by veg","there was little to glean from this book. it does offer some interesting ideas, and a beginner's style guide for rice, but does not really touch on all the traditional vegetarian dishes in japanese cuisine. also, which rather irked me, was that they suggested using bonito in some of the recipes, which is definitely not vegetarian! all in all, an okay book for people who like to putter around the kitchen and have to make sushi for their vegetarian friends, a little basic for anyone who cooks often at home and has a nodding acquaintance with vegetarian cooking."
5,so much fun,"I am having a blast with this magic kit. My son got it as a gift. He is 6 1/2 and this is perfect for him. He needs some help doing the tricks, but this is great. Would be great for older kids too!!!! AWESOME!!"
1,can't get the right set - tried twice,"So I just received my second Crayola Super Art Coloring Kit - however, it is not the one advertised. I ordered the first one was told sorry, we'll make sure you get the correct item. Well, I just received the second one and guess what - nope, not the right one again!!! There was no paint tray, no stampers, and no model magic. I am soooo disappointed in Amazon for having the wrong set advertised. There is not enough time before Christmas to get the correct set, so I will need to go out and buy additional items to supplement. Wouldn't have to do that if I got the right kit the first time."
1,Not what appears in description.,"This chasis seems like a great buy but don't be fooled by what is written in the description. After recieving it we realized it did not include the features that are listed. All we received was a empty chasis, no extras. After contactiog Amazon and mentioning the error they were very happy to send us another chasis regretting the error. Well, another arrived and once again we received an empty chasis. After several attempts to have them send us post paid mailing labels to return the 2 chasis to them we have heard nothing but excuses. ""We don't know what happened, it must be the shipping companys problem', (re:the mailing label), etc. So here we sit with 2 Antec Chasis which are not what we expected and we will either be billed for both or we will have to return them at our own expense.We have shopped Amazon for years for birthday and holiday gifts but after this experience I doubt we will ever shop here again."
2,Just plain depressing.,"The final installment in the Dollanganger saga is just plain depressing. Nothing went right for anybody in this book: Cathy was still haunted by her days in captivity in the attic, Chris was as incestuously lustful as ever, Jory was seriously injured and forced to end his dancing days, Melodie was mentally unstable and left him after their children were born, Bart was obsessive and manipulative, Cindy was a strumpet...nobody was happy and little, if any, good happened.I gave two starts because it's important to read this book if you want to learn how the series ends."
3,I had to read this to finish the series.,"By the time I read this installment I was getting bored. I was so in love with Cathy in 'Flowers'. But I cannot believe she died in that damn attic while making a purple paper worm. A terrible ending. But on the other hand, she never really escaped the attic did she? But then again on the OTHER hand, why would she agree to live in that mansion in the first place after the dreaded estate was rebuilt? When it was announced that it would be rebuilt, she should have had a fit and refused to see it through.You can only take so much from these books; Uncle Joel, learning to paint in bed while paralyzed. Oh boy I'm glad the series is over. All in all, 'Flowers' and 'Petals' were the only two that really moved me."
5,stupendous,"what an excellent cd, he needs to tour the us, i actually picked up the cd in italy over the summer and i like it so much, If you like this you shoulc check out The sicillians Featuring Angelo Venuto. ..."
3,Lovely but may not be worth the $$$,"I love the retro look of my new toaster and got a good price (relatively speaking) on amazon as the pink was on sale. Does an ok job of toasting but I wouldn't say its worth the price. Also, the slots are kind of shallow so my larger pieces of bread stick out a little (by larger, I mean Country Hearth). Also, I miss having different functions like defrost. I found myself drooling over a $60 chrome cusinart at lowes yesterday.We'll see how many years this lasts, maybe that's where the value comes in? Except I don't really recall any toasters in the past ever breaking down, usually I just get bored or it got too beat up looking and I purchased a new one."
3,This toaster is...,"Not really all it is cracked up to be, I don't think. It does okay, seems to be built okay, but doesn't seem to be as ""heavy duty"" or as ""restaurant quality"" as advertised. Awful lot to pay for a toaster...had hoped it would be as nice/high quality as other European kitchen items I own. All told, had I been able to use one before I purchased it, I would have selected a less expensive but equal-quality US-made toaster. I avoided US-made because I wanted something ""tough"" and ""restaurant quality."""
1,Overpriced junk.,"I purchased this toaster at the end of December. I only used it lightly for a few months, when it broke. The lever will not go back into the down position. I have to stand and hold down the knob in order to get a piece of toast done. The slots do not allow for bagel sized or large slices of bread. I am just so disappointed in this, but mostly when I wrote to Dualit, they did not make an attempt to have this fixed for me, and now the return time is expired. Don't buy this product. I had my cheap toasters for years, never a problem. Big mistake. Price does not equal quality."
1,Objective Review,"Like another reviewer, I waited a couple of years to form my opinion. This product looks sturdy and people love the ""legend of the Dualit"". One side comment is that I find it very amusing that a manual toast lever is considered a winning feature.Anyway, back to my review. Bread does not toast evenly. After time, the problem only gets worse. No real way to easily clean the inside of the toaster.Bottom line is I love this toaster. What else can I say about a toaster that cost $300. The toaster either works great or I am bloody crazy for spending that kind of money. I choose to love the toaster."
5,Durable and simple fun!,"We have a tiki bar in our home, and the drummer is one of the highlights. Everyone has to push that button for a laugh. It's just a cute little toy, yet quite sophisticated and durable for the price. He actually drums to the beat of the music! We've probably had it for 2 years and it's still going strong (and that's with a toddler that gets her hands on it occasionally)."
5,Another glimpse into the Evans/Coltrane/Cannonball Miles Quintet,"Nothing to say but PURE RAW ENERGY! Again, not the greatest sound recording, but the music makes that a null point."
2,Lowbrow puff piece does Lionel no Justice,"This ""licensed"" Lionel book has been corporately washed and shoved out the door. The photography is stylish, but hardly informative. Lionel buffs want the real story of Lionel's rise and fall, rise and fall with real people behind the pictures. For a Lionel fan, this book is a big disappointment. A better book just came out entitled ""Lionel: America's Favorite Toy Trains"" by MBI Publishers. It is everything this book isn't - and cheaper."
5,reading,"Great Book. She tells it like it is , that is a good thing . It helps that she shares her own experiences , problems and has over come them ."
5,Another winner from Joyce...,"Joyce always hits the mark and this book is no exception. If your feelings/emotions are driving you to do things you regret, READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Pretty good,"I found this book easy to read but in some ways it was a bit too ""light"" for me. Still I find the lessons in it helpful and will read it again."
2,"Poor theory, good applications","This text was used at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for an honors OB course. It served the class well by providing relevant and often humorous applications of theory. However, the descriptions of the actual theories themselves were weak and vague often referring to other concepts not yet learned."
3,"Great story, but NOT the book","I own the hardcover copy of the book, ""Mind Out Of Time"" and enjoy it. The book is clearly a 5-star book for Stasheff fans. When I found that it was available for Kindle, I purchased it.This is not the book ""Mind Out Of Time"". This is the story/novella ""Mind Out Of Time"" dealing with the origin of Dr. Angus MacAran. The other stories are not included. There is an excerpt (""Time And Tide"") from an upcoming GRIPE novel entitled Stealing Time, but none of the other stories are present.I don't regret buying it - this was the longest story in the collection by far, and it was not priced as a full book; however, the other reviews and the item description DO NOT describe what you will be buying - they refer to the print version. You will get the novella Mind Out Of Time, but not the full anthology."
5,Gene Harris is the BOMB!,"This is a great CD. If you like Ray Brown, go over your music collection by him and you will realize that the best stuff has Gene Harris on it. Same thing here... Get this and enjoy it!"
5,Cheerleader Kim Possible,"I'm just so happy My Heroine,My 2nd Idol,My 2nd Role Model,My Angel of Truth and Justice,My Champion,and My Mentor Princess got renewed for a 4th season.I should put this toy on my birthday,which happens to be Saturday December 3rd, or Christmas list."
3,sleeping pet,"I purchased this for a friend whose beloved pet passed away. After the original scare of thinking the vet had mistakenly returned the pet's deceased body, she found it amusing and comforting. I wouldn't really consider this a toy to be played with, but it would make a good sleeping companion for a child who would like a dog, but for whatever reason can't have the real thing."
3,"sleeping, breathing dog",My granddaughters love this toy because they want a real dog and this delays the inevitable of a real dog. It has no real educational value but they love to pet and sit with it.
4,The Interracial Dating Book for Black Women Who Want to Date White Men review,"I have not read this book yet and I am not ready to date anyone yet, so I will have to wait."
4,Does the job,"Good item to have as a photographer. Except the backgrounds with the velcro tabs do not line up with the male velcro, assembly line laziness....best advice is never mind the velcro, go to dollar store and get some plastic spring clamps and attach otherwise you will constantly be refitting....Overall a decent product. Tip to maufacturer or distributor > make instructions that people can understand to fold the thing up <"
4,"Professional cube, good price.","This cube looks very professional. It is a nice size that is manageable to fold with only one person. I have a larger one, but I have a hard time closing it by myself. There was a 1 1/2"" portion of a seam that was starting to separate, but it wasn't all the way through. I wish the fabric was a little heavier. Overall good Cube."
4,nice giallo,"mostly for fans of Giallo, B-movies, or Horror Junkies...Lenzi is a hack, but did alright with this film..."
4,Missing the eighties,"I was eating breakfast at a local diner/music store in Seattle and this was playing in the background. I'd never heard it before and it had a definite re-infused eighties sound. I'm a cautious cd buyer, but it was such a good cd that I bought it on the spot. I've sinced loaned it to two of my music aficianado friends who also loved it. It's not compelling because the tracks are drop-dead gorgeous or demanding, and I don't think it has pretensions of either. It's just good mood music, slightly wistful at times with a great beat. I like it because I can put it on and still think about other things, but also find myself bopping along. So, if you like music that isn't challenging, but enjoyable, and you're missing the eighties, then I think this is a great cd for you."
5,Amazing!,"I baught all the episodes of Yami no Matsuei and I love it! YnM is one of the best shounen-ai anime I have ever seen, and I have fallen in lovew with the characters. Tsuzuki is just adorable and when he is hurting you just want to pick him up and hugg him tightly. Hisoka is such a cutie though he is kinda angsty, you just want Tsuzuki to hug him ~_^and Muraki, well i don't want to hug him I hate him but I love to hate him. He is so evil and cunnning and the most interesting and in-depth badguy I have ever seen.Plus you just want Hisoka and Tsuzuki to get together! By the end I waS begining them to kiss."
5,Relax,This stuff will ease all your aches and pains away. Caution though you might fall asleep it's so relaxing.
1,Waste of Money: this is not a book for people with ALLERGIES,"So much for being 'complete': this book is utterly useless for us as my son has serious wheat and egg allergies. we have been told to avoid spelt as it is too closely related to wheat. The authors don't offer any real alternatives. If you have a wheat allergy, I wouldn't bother."
3,Technology leaves it behind!,"This book explores the concepts of what causes an epidemic or current trend. There is an ""afterword"" in the book, but these changes need to be incorporated in a totally new edition."
5,Great read,"Entertaining and thought provoking, a fun read and educational all in one. Highly reccomend."
2,A great book spoiled,"Gladwell has several fascinating ideas. However the book suffers from poor writing, and from considering many issues closed (ie the theory of Judith Harris on how peers influence children more than parents are presented as Gospel truth) Its a pity, since for The New Yorker Gladwell is a witty, thought-provoking author with a quicksilver intelligence, but in this book he takes 200+ pages to tell us something which can be summarised on a A4 sheet. Actually, what the writing style reminded me most was of a book like ""Unlimited Power"" by Anthony Robbins - I think the marketeers have had a heavy influence on the dumbing down. Gladwell's basic thesis - that tiny things not only make big differences, but make the biggest differences - has the makings of a fascinating book - if it was better written and, ironically, didn't take itself as seriously as this one."
4,Why do Big Changes Occur?,"if you ever wondered why Big Changes occur, then you need to read The Tipping Point. Gladwell's style of writing about technical topics is something everyone can enjoy."
1,Tipping Point was a Drag,"I thought that this would be as good as the Outliers. It wasn't. Tedious is a fair description. To be fair, I couldn't finish it."
5,Valid in business and in life,"I have had to re-read the Tipping Point and number of times over the last few months and it just keeps getting better. Being aware of how information flows among groups is key to marketing, sales, business development and even personal relationships. This book is epecially important for understanding people in the role of information security. A classic."
3,Pretty Good,"I read this book with high expectations, and while it was enjoyable it was very slow at times (Especially the children's learning info)"
2,Enough already.......,Obviously I am in the minority here - but I was sorely disappointed in what I read of this book.As a Sociology Major I was excited and all aquiver to read this facinating book. But after the Hush Puppy example in the first few pages of the book I seriously found myself wondering how many examples of the exact same thing I was going to have to read through.I really do admire the authors boundless enthusiasm for this subject matter - well - at least I did for about the first 50 pages.
4,The Tipping Point,"A very interesting, fresh viewpoint,fairly quick read. Some amusing insights that you can share with others and open your conceptual view of certain events. There is business insight which was particularily valuable to me - but not all. He gets bogged dwon in a couple spots with overkill of studies and issues."
4,Provokes Thought,"Malcolm Glidewell's 'The Tipping Point' teased my curiosity concerning why and how trends start. He analyzes trends such as Hush Puppies shoes and how different factors impacted their popularity. 'Stickiness' as he describes it, is fascinating to me because it is both explainable and unexplainable. He attempts to explain where trends begin and why.While Glidewell tends to reverse analyze trends that have already made it to the mainstream, it is an enjoyable read and opens one's eyes to how some, unassuming business owners watched their businesses go viral. He also explains that its not always necessarily luck or an accident."
1,pop sociology well marketed,"I managed to read the entire book, though had to fight my desire to through the book to the trash can. Given the hype, I conclude that this pop sociology book is a case study about how to use great marketing to substitute for substance. Gladwell is a marketing guy, and it shows.Save your money, do some research on Googles about the topic from neuroscience, economics, finance, and geneticists instead."
1,"don't purchase, get from library","Don't buy this book, get it from the library. You'll read it once.The book itself is very fluffy, it seems as if he wrote the entire thing off the top of his head. (I.e. the mavens salesman theory etc.). He regularly makes causal statements without any evidence and acts as if they are already given truths. At best, this book is a sampling of some famous psyc experiments."
1,BORING....,"I picked this book up after hearing about it in ""Freakonomics"". I was so disappointed that I had to just stop reading it. If I wasn't falling asleep, I was just waiting for him to stop repeating the same thing. I think it should have been called ""Get to the Point"" instead of ""Tipping Point"". All I can remember from this book is finally putting it down after being tortured with the chapter on ""Sesame Street"".Such a shame. If you are looking for a GREAT read, pick up ""Freakonomics"" or ""never eat alone"".Otherwise, if you are looking to cure your insomnia, pick this book up."
2,It could have been written in 40 pages,"This book felt like a series of random articles bloated out of proportion to end up being a book. Truth to be told, there were some interesting ideas and I enjoyed the first 40-50 pages but after that the author kept repeating himself, brought up ideas that had little connection to the whole topic and did not make too much effort to explain their relevance. I struggled through the last 150 pages.I started his other bestseller book, Blink, couple of months back: it was the same incoherent mass of information so I quit somewhere around the hundredth page after the writer has written down all he knows and started repeating the same ideas over and over again. Based on the structure of Tipping Point I don't think I have missed anything as he tends to start with all his brilliant findings and then just maundering through the rest of the book."
3,New terms for old theories,"I read this book last week over the course of a businesss trip. Gladwell presents a list of case studies where an idea, product, or disease did or didn't succeed. His case studies are superficially interesting, and Gladwell attempts to reorganize phenomena for better analysis, but his use of non-standard terminology for previously-defined phenomena (such as the network effect, first movers, etc.) are simply new decoration on old theories."
3,See also: Blink,"Blink, also by this author, is a smoother read and had much more impact for me in business. Having said that, this book ends in about chapter 2 when you 'get it' and then realize the book is essentially a better explanation of viral marketing, the web-of-word-of-mouth, consumer behavior or anything similar in B-school or HBR. It is a good read though; excellent author/journalist."
4,Somewhat voluminous - but a good read...,"Written in an easy to read and understand style, the book conveys messages that are deep and wide at the same time. Most have to do with why certain things happen defying logic.As you read and ponder - you will begin discovering many answers in this book. Most importantly - what starts and sustains fads and buzz - this is of great importance for the common business person as well as government officials.Although I found it in the business section - the underlying concepts are valid on a much wider scale. This is so because human behavior is the primary force that results in the phenomena called the Tipping Point.The matter could have been condensed - but once you start getting the essence of what the author is trying to stay, you may be able to skip certain paragraphs and go through the book faster. That is what worked for me..."
4,The Tipping Point: The Election,"Nate and Huff Post, plus other media, kept mentioning the “tipping point “...this idea has become part of our lexicon!"
5,The Tipping Point: Little things can make a big different.,"The Tipping Point book is a well wriiten and a well researched book. It has example's to keep the reader focused on the roles people play, and how these roles lead to a distribution of information and/or a connection with other people, or making someting stick. Each chapter in the book keeps the reader engaged and proves that little things can make a big difference. This book gave me the understanding of how each individual has the capacity to provide different services or resources according to their personal style. Some of us are connectors, others are information carriers. But each of us play a role in the greater universe even when we're unaware of it. I highly recommend this book for all readers, but especialey for college students who need guidance and support to reach thier goals. I rate this book #1, Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent author. I will read all of his books!"
2,BLAH BLAH BLAH,"boring book, and many of the example he uses to prove this theory dont do that. For every example that seemed to make sense, there was another he used that didn't."
4,"Accurate, if a little precious","Malcolm Gladwell, a respected science writer, takes on the task of updating us on how chaotic systems (informal communication, crime, epidemics, and so on) affect our everyday lives. He cites numerous examples to show that even a slight change in initial conditions can mean the difference between a bull and a bear market, or between a rumor's being spread or not.All this is convincing, as far as it goes. However, Gladwell does not seem to give his readers much credit, believing that we will lose interest unless he gives the different roles in the transmission of information cute names like ""Mavens"" and ""Connectors"". He occasionally glosses over complicated points when more detail would have been appreciated."
4,Punctuated Equilibrium - Life Is Not Linear,"Gladwell rightly points out that big change can come from unexpected places, at unexpected times. Very often, it also comes all at once. Makes sense. If the future could be predicted with precision, we could all do exactly average, all the time.Look at the dotcom meltdown, which occurred when 90% of Wall Street investment analysts were still bullish. History doesn't arrive in a linear fashion - it cuts and weaves like a bad driver. Just watch what happens to real estate values now that interest rates have ""tipped"" upward. The problem, of course, is that tipping points are hard to spot before the fact. I offer for your consideration Trump and Kiyosaki (Why We Want You To Be Rich), who still tout real estate as a great investment. After it becomes obvious to everyone else, they will be saying that cash is king (again)."
2,Puzzled,"I am puzzled over the generally positive reviews of this book. There are some interesting anecdotes throughout the book. However, the general thesis does not seem well supported by the specific examples. There are numerous factual errors and claims unsupported by the data he cites. In addition, there are a large number of conclusions drawn from data that seems to support the opposite conclusion. Much of the book is devoted to providing new names to common behaviors and activities and then attempting to justify the notion that some new truth has been discovered. I think Ross Johnson, erstwhile CEO of RJR said it best, Gladwell has provided with numerous BGOs (Blazing Glimpse of the Obvious).What I find especially puzzling is the tremendous popularity of this book and his subsequent book ""Blink."" I certainly am not interested in reading anything he writes in the future.There are far better ways to spend 4-5 hours of your life than reading this book."
1,The Tipping Point,"The book was listed as ""new,"" but it was bruised and beaten upon arrival. The item was stuffed into a very small, non-padded envelope which resulted in severely dented corners around the entire book. There was also a dark pencil line across the back, which made me doubt how new the book actually was."
2,"Does not deliver, this book is just a Hype","The author goes into different tangents not keeping focus on the subject matter. For instance, talks about channel capacity(a psychological phenomenon), no relavence to the chapter or the topic.The author says a simple thing in so many words. The book could have been written in 5 pages than 200. Also the writer's use of illustrations was poor.The only insightful point that I got from the book is - ""Word of mouth marketing has become very effective. In most cases it is more effective than the conventional methods of marketing"""
5,Start Your Own Epidemic,"I read this book immediately after Freakonomics and would suggest this sequence of books as they seem to reinforce each other somehow.Gladwell looks at a wide variety of social epidemics and gives his view on how they come to be so incredibly popular. He looks at a variety of personalities he calls Mavens, Connectors and Salesmen and how they contribute to social epidemics. This characterization gave me some insight into myself and others.As an author, I have come across people who fall in love with my work and then go out and ""sell"" 40 books. The Tipping Point gave me some insight into how this happens and even some tips to help me identify these people upon meeting!If you are curious why some things become fads and take our culture by storm, give this book a read. I read this in less than two days, which is very fast for me.I highly recommend this book to those thinking about social media, marketing and the new economy.CJ West[...]"
5,A Classic on Human Consumer Behavior,Right up there with Popular Delusions and Madness of Crowds. Great insight on crowd behavior and what can trigger it.
4,Pop psychology that you can really use.,"This book has been around for a while now, and may have lost a little of the cache it enjoyed when it first hit the big time. I have read elsewhere that Mr. Gladwell 's theories have fallen somewhat out of style, and have been outright dismissed as being too light, or painted in too broad a stroke to be taken seriously.I disagree. The writing is wonderfully accessible. The examples relevant and timely.This book is well worth the time and intellectual effort of anyone who wants to explore different perspectives on what fuels the advent of all sorts of social trends.Got something to sell? Read this book. Trying to get a handle on ""the next big thing""? Read this book.Want to be fascinated by the insights of someone whose profession is figuring out why people do the weird and crazy things they do? Read this book.It is is enlightening as it is entertaining."
4,Tipping Point,"Very interesting book and well presented. The author takes the central concept and provides real world examples in a very imaginative way. What is also facinating is the way the book personalizes the players in the Tipping Point, which personalizes the book for the reader. Excellent!"
4,Infectious enthusiasm,"Malcolm Gladwell has a genius for getting a concept across. I have followed his career in the New Yorker ever since the ""Blacks are like boys..."" article, and was delighted to pick up his book. The separate segments in this book are strong, as he chronicles various phenomena around his thesis. The one distraction to me was the need to tie all the loose ends together. I would have enjoyed it more as a collection of essays. That said, whether you agree that it all comes together or not, it's an entertaining, edifying read."
3,"Creative, but flawed",I have mixed feelings about this book. It is wonderfully written and contains some fresh insights. The author does seem to stretch the evidence at times to support his thesis.
4,Now part of our culture,"I just read this book now, 3 years after it was published, and after I was through the first chapter I became aware that TV and Radio news columnists were using the phrase ""tipping point"" all over the place. Selective awareness on my part, or is the book becoming a self fulfilling prophecy of itself? Seriously, this book will make you think about all types of issues, fads, trends, and makes me feel compelled to do the 'little things' in my own small environment to see if I can change the world! (maybe my little review will help!)If you are interest in people, or why things happen, buy this book."
2,Looking for Proof,"This is an interesting and easy read for the intelligent mind. The author promises a lot in the title of ""how little things can make a big difference"" and offers an absorbing theory for this phenomenon. While the author linked his theory of epidemiology with psychology and sociology using compelling stories including Sesame Street, Blue's Clues, and the Fall of New York City Crime it seems this connection though correlation is flawed in that the author was simply looking for events, and interpretations of events, that confirmed his theory. One may also write a book about ""how big things can make a big difference"" or ""how big things make a bigger difference than little things"".As I said, this is a nice read for a Sunday afternoon, but I wouldn't make any ""big"" decisions based on the information in this book."
4,"Great movie, don't listen to the whiny naysayers.","I've been a GL fan for years & this movie was everything I hoped it would be. It was very entertaining. My girlfriend who is NOT a comic book fan at all loved it, as did her two kids aged 12 & 15. When we left the theater after seeing it for the first time her boy said ""That was an awesome movie!""So don't listen to the negativity of a bunch of nerds who need to get out of their rooms once in awhile and get some fresh air & sunlight. ""Die hard"" comic book nerds complain about the Avengers and the Dark Knight movie as well. It just proves you'll never make them happy."
3,I've seen better but there's some worthy humor,"So most people critiquing this movie whine about the problems with the ultraviolet. Who cares, I am critiquing the movie. It's a cliche' superhero movie with all the testosterone BS but at least the love interest recognized him with his mask on which is more than we can say about Lois Lane! And if nothing else...Ryan is one awesome piece of eye candy!"
2,Mainly kid oriented,"I watch other movies of this kind with my 16 y.o. son, but this is the most 'weak' and younger kid oriented in my opinion amongst those we watched together."
3,Green Lantern,For a sifi movie this was pretty good. Not way out there and it had a story line. I would watch the movie again.
1,The digital copy that never was,"Don't be fooled by the almost fraudulent claim of a ""digital copy"" included in this package. It doesn't exist. What you get is a streamed version of the movie IF (and only if) you download an App (Flixster) & sign up to TWO different subscriptions (Flixster & Ultraviolet) & even then - according to some reports - it may not work.The movie is brainless fun. The packaging is a crafty con job. I returned the item & paid for my copy through iTunes."
3,Fun,"Well, Ryan Reynolds is great to look at, and the 3D makes it fun. It does enough to let the characters be a part of the movie experience."
2,Empty but watchable,"I'm not exactly sure why this movie didn't thrill me. I love the genre and I thought the actors all did a fine job. The special effects were nice. Still, the whole experience felt shallow. I think the movie lacked heart. The villians had weak motives and were underdeveloped. If the bad guys don't matter, its difficult to connect with the heroes."
2,The two biggest problems with Green Lantern...,"All great superhero movies have a origin story that has you rooting for the hero before they finally transform into the hero they were destined to become. Superman came to Earth as a child and learned to balance his powers with human kindness. Spiderman over-comes guilt over the death of his uncle to become New York's savior. Here's the first problem with Green Lantern: the origin story is basically ""Hey kid, here's a magic ring!"" Boom, we're done. The second problem with the movie is Blake Lively. Yes, she is a beautiful woman but with the incredible ability to slow every scene she's in to a dead stop."
1,!!!,"I never got it!!!!! Please check into that!! I am so glad u reminded me!So where is it?? Since I have to put more words in, I'll tell u of my disappointmentAnd the review come now in March?"
1,Wait until they fix the DVD package,"There is NO digital DVD included.One must go through a cumbersome process of downloading the movie. This procedure was very time-consuming to go through. The authorization process is a hassle. Wait until the movie includes a physical copy of the digital version.The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging.The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I liked the movie."
4,Good deal,"Movies are generally cheaper online and in this case it was. My husband loves this movie so it made for a good birthday present. Recommend to anyone who likes comics/heros, etc ..."
2,NOT A REAL DIGITAL COPY,"Though the digital copy is not the biggest thing in buying this movie, I personally like to expand that library as well and well this movie does not provide that. You cannot put it on your phone or use it on any tablet. You can use it on the ONLY PROGRAM it will let you which I hadn't heard about until I bought it. Ultraviolet. And well this program will let you use your other digital copy files, it will not permit you to use the property you bought with any other program. it is not a ""Digital Copy"" it is an ""ULTRAVIOLET digital copy"" ie. worthless."
4,Good Director's Cut... All in the Green,"Sometimes Director's Cuts of the movies are just adding scenes that should have stayed on the cutting floor. Not the case with the Green Lantern Director's Cut, the scenes, specially the flashbacks to Hal Jordan's childhood are very pertinent to enjoy the story even more.This is a movie that at first look didn't meet with my approval, but I loved the character so much that I decided to give it a second chance in bluray and it was so much better. In fact, it became one of my favorites of the year. Don't miss it."
3,Better than I thought it was going to be...,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie having been a fan since my childhood. He in fact has always been my favourite Superhero.Having read a number of reviews, I expected the worst and so was pleasantly surprised.It's a good fun movie. It provides a relatively quick background (unlike Captain America which went too long I thought) and gets us into the action pretty quickly. Ryan Reynolds was a good casting of Hal Jordan and I thought he did a great job and didn't take himself to seriously.I thought the movie was let down by the ""bad guy"", a ""yellow fear"" of a moving mass that consumes all in its path. And Parallax, what a name. Sounds like a medication.I'd happily see a sequel if there are sufficient DVD sales of this one to warrant it.Bring on The Justice League movie!"
4,Not as good as expected but very good movie regardless,As anyone knows 90% of the movies we see the previews for we have high hopes of something super spectacular. The movies normally turn out alright just not as expected. It was a very good movie and Ryan Reynolds is a genius and just too funny. I haven't seen a movie he played in yet that wasn't good. He can make any movie entertaining. It's a definite watch don't list to the negative comments about the movie. If you haven't seen it be sure to do so!
1,Frustrated!,"Add me to the list of complaints about Warner/Flixster/Ultraviolet and the digital copy that was NOT ""Included."" Over a week bantering back and forth with customer service, and I STILL haven't gotten the stupid movie to work. Warner Brothers has gone beyond the pale for unnecessary complexity, a bad user experience, and misleading packaging. I fail to see why I need two separate accounts on two separate services, especially when the two of them do nothing except finger-point at each other as to where there problem lies. Save your money, folks. Wait for the ""Special Corporate Apology Edition."""
5,Fun,"Action packed, rip-roarin fun!!!! Saw this in the theater and bought it immediately on Blu Ray. Ryan Reynolds is at his best here."
3,In blackest night,"This movie was nowhere near as bad as a majority of the reviews on the internet would lead you to believe. Sure the movie's been getting trashed since it's release but overall it's an enjoyable film & I think from the fanboys standpoint perhaps the films not up to par with Green Lanterns rich history & mythology. From that viewpoint I can totally understand because like most movie adaptations the film feels a bit rushed in some parts & lacks some character development but hopefully a sequel will up the ante in action & character driven dynamics. I was never a huge follower of the Green Lantern comics but I think overall Martin Campbell, Ryan Reynolds, & company did a pretty decent job. Green Lantern is nowhere near as bad as say, Catwoman or as embarrassing as both Matrix sequels."
1,worst. movie. ever.,"I would give it zero stars if I could. I like action movies, superhero movies, and almost every actor involved with this film. But this movie was worse than Spawn. Boring, ridiculous and tedious all at the same time. Sad that so many talented people wasted their time making this film. I would not recommend you waste any time watching it."
2,"Great actors, bad movie",There are a lot of really good actors in this film and they play their parts really well. The movie itself isn't that good though. I couldn't watch the whole thing. It sort of has a cartoon feel. The visuals and story don't measure up to the amazing actors who are in this.
3,green lantern,So-So ... I was a little surprised that The Green Lantern character was played a little too humorous and corny at times. I think it would have been a better movie had it been played straight.
1,Misleadiing package,"The package says in big letters ""Blu-Ray, DVD, Digital Copy"" on the top of the package. What you get is a DVD, an extended cut Blu-Ray, and permission to STREAM a digital copy of the mediocre movie Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet only got a 9% on the Rottentomatoes.com web site. You get to stream it to your home unit, you don't even get a digital copy of the cheesy second choice.Amazon is good enough to list it as a Blu-ray/DVD/Ultraviolet digital copy, but If you want Blu-ray, get the just Blu-ray copy, or just get the DVD.WB should be ashamed of this marketing ploy"
1,"UltraViolet Digital Copy, Two thumbs down.","The movie was great. 5 StarsDealing with the UltraViolet Digital Copy has been a nightmare. I could not download the movie, the worst customer service ever. I may not purchase anymore movies that require me to access an UltraViolet Digital Copy account."
4,Some of the sound is missing from the Bonus Features.,I'm having the same problem too. Who can we report this to so we can get a credit or refund?
1,Digital Copy is a SCAM,"I was very peeved when I found out the ""digital"" copy cannot be played on iTunes. They get around this by making you download the app for Flixster which allows you to play the movie. However before you can do this, you must create an Ultraviolet account and a Flixster account. Yes, just what I need. More stupid accounts."
3,Digital copy is LAME,"The movie is fine, but the digital copy is deceptive. It puts your movie on a ""cloud"" account, so you can only access it that way. It's really deceptive, because it gives you the option to ""save to your computer"" - that's a LIE. You save it to their account. I looked at the help section, and it clearly says you cannot download it to anything else, once you use Flixster. I am NOT happy. You can watch it on your portable device, but ONLY *through* Flixster. It is not actually *your own* copy."
1,NO WAY,This movie was a waste of time money and really stupid. The plot was horrible the special eefects looked out of a cartoon and was really dumb
1,a 2-hour-long TOM SERVO moment,"Even on blu-ray, it was a 2-hour-long TOM SERVO moment. Go with the $5 direct-to-video ""The Green Lantern: First Flight"" and ""Green Lantern: Emerald Knights."" Both have better stories."
3,Sleepwalker's paradise,"I felt like nobody really wanted to be in this movie. Very disappointed with the actors and the pacing. The effects were okay, but the ""Keanu Reeves style Klatu"" feel just didn't work at all. I'm a comic book fan from the fifties, so my tolerance levels for this genre are pretty high. This was stretching it a little too far."
4,COOL!!!!,"This was good! did not deserve harsh reviews the movie was a little 2 short need more development of personel and the Green Latern Core. Ryan Renolds did a good job he needs to read more Hal Jordon in the Comics.and I here they are going to make part 2. so there, if you like the Grenn Latern by the move I am"
5,...........,"This was a good movie, I enjoyed watching it. I would recommend this movie to friends, family, or other people."
5,Good movie,I liked it. Lots of adventure scenes. Glad I bought it. I like shows like this and this one will not disappoint you.
3,Pretty Lame,"All right let's be honest, with the exception of Christopher Nolan's two Batman movies, Marvel movies have killed those by DC. Green Lantern did nothing to change that tide. Ryan Reynolds is great as the lead character but he has so little to work with. He carries the movie on his charm and skill not due to any great help.The film is plodding and features very few true great action scenes. It seems like a movie that can't decide what it wants to be. All in all a weak addition to the super hero genre."
1,Still..can't get into Italian horror movies!,"With the exception of ""Demons"" and maybe ""Demons 2"", all these Italian horror films just do not impress me.The acting is always poor, the zombies or monsters always look fake, the stories are very hard to follow, or too boring to even care..and the dubbing is terrible.Black Demons has everything that i mentioned above and more..no suspense, no horror or scary moments in the film, no good looking women (that's a surprize being an italian film)and the soundtrack in the movie is horrible.Zombie fans...Even if you saw every zombie movie there is, good or bad, this STILL should NOT be on your list of movies-to-watch!"
1,More gore garbage from Italy,"Italian horror films are either really good or really bad, and the really bad ones are really entertaining for laughs or just painful to watch. This is one of the worst of the bad. Not even good to laugh at. Its more poor acting, more poor special effects, and more poor directing. This was released as Demoni 3 in Italy (a supposed sequel to Lamberto Bava's Demoni and Demoni 2), but don't let that trick you into buying this garbage. Only for the most die hard Italian Horror fanatic."
3,Rambles,"The book was decent, but I don't think it was anything terribly special. I thought that, in addition to rambling on about certain points, the author jumped around in his time line. He would mention things that made no sense because what would have introduced you to that point doesn't appear for several pages.Overall, not too bad, but not the best either."
4,The book is a classic.,"I only bought the book for a friend named ""Camille"" who did not know anything about her literary namesake. I am not sure off the top of my head if this is the same author who wrote ""The Three Musketeers."" or not. I think this is the son. I can highly recommend the original B&W movie version starring Greta Garbo. I don't get emotional easily but the movie moved me. Also, obvious why Garbo was considered one of the ""great"" ones."
5,A Foundational Truth,"For anyone who has been regenerated or born again with Jesus Christ this book is a foundational truth to start with. This is a great starting point to understanding how Christ modeled humility, love, servant-hood, towards the ""one anothers"" and the world. It is a must read before getting into ministry of any kind. This book helps reveal the motives of our hearts for what we do in ministry. In anything we do, the motive has to be ALL Him. We are to be reduced, lessen, made to nothing so He can be All in All in what ever we do. Since absolutely nothing is possible with man, the power Of the Holy Spirit, God, makes this impossibility a reality. Many of the Lord's truths can be unpacked in this little book."
5,Revising your Identity,"For the serious heart of a Christian this book evaporates self-centeredness and temporal, human smoke-screens. It silences the voices both of pride and self-debasement. It focuses the heart on the simplicity and the reality of your eternal identity in Christ, His unconditional love for you, and your Love-enabled ability to see yourself in Him, as you really are... now and forever. Clarity, Peace, Truth and amazing Grace regain their rightful place in your heart, transforming your mind. A priceless treasure for $.99!"
3,"Some Decent, Possibly Outdated Info",It is an easy read with some interesting and valuable information. Make sure you pay no more than five bucks or so because that is about all this book is worth.
1,Boring,"A very dry, self glorifying effort at expanding his image, Jim McDougal's book is as boorish as the man himself perhaps was. We were saved his testimony in the Grand Jury, perhaps for the better. Truly an old boy who liked to make himself bigger than he really was."
4,"Delightful late Stan, the Man","In going back and reviewing my nearly complete works of Stan Getz, the greatest Jazz sax man of all time, I've decided that this delightful album really deserves to be better known. I'll do my part.One of the best of the classic late 80's Getz posthumous albums. Getz had curtailed his, umm, bad habits and the disease he would eventually die from was in remission. This concert is well recorded, better than some other late concerts and there is lively interaction between Getz, Kenny Barron and the others. They seem to be having a great time together playing off each other.What sets this album apart is the song selection including ""Slow Boat to China"" is somewhat unusual for Getz.Four to five stars - Getz fans should have this in their collection!"
1,Why?,"Why would you use this item when any type of ball works? Tennis balls are my choice, and they can even be spritzed with some fragrance!"
5,good movie,"this movie is a really good documentary. It's very detailed and tells you everything about the Donner Party and the horrible things that they went through. It might be a little boring for high school students because it's not a real life movie; meaning that it has old pictures and some scenery. However, once all of the horrible ordeals start to happen these students become very interested in it. I personally love this movie as a history teacher."
4,Anthony's Great Read,This book is fascinating. Evelyn Anthony is a writer who puts herself into her writing so that the reader can be right in the story. I have enjoyed all of the books I have read.
4,Jackie's Great Book Review,Do you have something that you love very much? All she spends her time writing in her journal and writing poems about her week and when she was born and what happened when she was growing up. In one part she wrote a poem about aDay dreaming Yesterday I visited my favorite spot at macombs part three blocks away. I crept as far down the bank as my leather loafers would let me without slipping then I pulled up a slah of rock and beside the Harlem River. I think this was a good book and I think other people would enjoy reading this. This helped me think about what it would be like if you had know friends or family that would care for you except your aunt. This book shows a lot of courage and strength being without you family there by your side
1,same old notebook about a girl's troubled life.,"Jazmine is a girl that that lives with her sister in a broken down apartment in the city. Jazmine's mother is an alcoholic in rehab. Her father died in a car crash a few years ago. She is a smart girl that writes poems and things about her life in her notebook. The plot of the book seems interesting but the way it was written wasn't very good. I wouldn't recommend this book to teenagers. Jazmine's Notebook doesn't have any big events that take place, it gets boring because she basically says the same things over and over again. When you read the book her dad already is dead and her mom is already in rehab. The whole book is just about how she deals with it all. There isn't a big ending to look foward to like in most books. This book could have been better."
2,Jazmin's Notebook....good book?,"No, not really. It was just a book of journal entries and poems.It was just about a girl surrounded by drugs,sex,alcohol,and gunfire in Harlem. She is a real optimistic person and takes life day by day. It was a rather boring book and there was no climax in it. I would not reccommend this book to anyone over the age of 12."
5,european facials vol. 2,"SIMPLY THE BEST FACIAL DVD I EVER SEEN, BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE VOL.1 THROUGH VOL.3, ALMOST 5HRS."
1,go with ilsa instead,"this nazi/erotica exploitation ""film"" fails to deliver the goods in my opinion.for true over-the-top thrills,check out ""ilsa she wolf of the ss""a much more exploitive(and entertaining)exploitation trash cinema masterpiece."
5,One of my favorites,"I am a big Stuart Woods fan. I read this book in one day I couldn't put it down. The plot keeps you guessing and the ending is great! I would definately recommend this for anyone wanting a little mystery, suspense, and romance."
4,Good Product,I really like this product it helped me lose the last few pounds I needed to lose for a special event and my belly fat really shaped up quite a bit.
1,misleading description,"CLA works for me. I believe all brands are probably equivalent. However, the description for this product is misleading. It say 180 softgels, two pack. To me that means two bottles, 180 pills in each bottle. Upon rereading, I realized there are only 90 pills in each bottle. That makes this a very bad (and expensive) deal. No thanks. I canceled my order."
5,Conspiracy Indeed,This is a great book for teens and parents alike.Reminds me some of the Srewtape Letters from C.S. Lewis.Reminds us all how the devil is ever working his conspiracy.
5,The Creed Review,Easy to read and understandable especially for non-theologians. I would definitely recommend for anyone interested to have a deeper understanding of their faith.
5,"AWESOME, UNDER APPRECIATED ALBUM !!!","In a genre of copy cats and trend followers, Post Mortem stood out with their debut effort. While not totally unique, their combination of death/thrash/doom metal with heavier hardcore vocals was a welcome change. Too bad this was overlooked. I'm an old school metal guy from day one, and this guitar sound is so heavy,it defies description. Huge,bulldozer riffs and a good combo of slow and fast parts. Excellent stuff!"
2,Wrong Picture,The picture shown does not match the part sent to me! I was able to get it to work; but what is so stinking hard about getting the picture right?
4,history of the nutrition industry,"A good read to compliment Pollen's books. The book traces the history of the rise of nutritionism and the corporate influence on how food is regulated. The book raises some interesting issues: to what extent should the individual have the right and responsibility to make their own food choices (even if the state has to bear much of the cost?).The book is well researched with lots and lots of data (which can make it dry) but Nestle does a good job of supporting her claims. The FDA has been gutted from making many food decisions because the food companies say their advice will affect the bottom line (well, no duh). But, why is it that the government is not allowed to present scientific data regardless of the effect on companies (if people can make the decision to eat lots of unhealthy food, shouldn't we also be given the opportunity to review scientific data and make our own decisions?)"
2,How outdated research Get outdated reviews,I thought this book was very outdated and hard to read because of the English accent Willis uses. The research was OK but a little bias against working class ( poor and broke)kids.
5,Most practical book on abundance,"As have many of the reviewers of this book, I have read many books on abundance, and this is the most practical and self responsible I have come across. Unlike the other abundance books which seem to appeal to a crowd that wants the ""quick fix"", this book teaches the self responsibility of looking at the aspects of your life, your thoughts and feelings that are pertinent to meaningful change. The exercises at the end of each chapter provide questions that lead you into yourself so that you grasp the concepts from more than an intellectual level - an important consideration. It provides a process of understanding as you work through the chapters. I highly recommend this book for those who wish to come to a deep and soulful understanding of abundance."
3,"Arrived with dead battery, works after replacing","Ours did not work when we first opened it. I was hoping it was just the battery and I wouldn't have to deal with a return. It was a little bit of a hassle finding the right size replacement battery. Once the battery was replace, it seems to work fine."
1,christianity - valuable?,"I find interweaving of religion into every single aspect of societal thinking out-dated and without sense. Religion does not deserve justification or a voice in areas where it causes nothing but trouble - gender, race, etc. Gender ""reconciliation,"" like race ""recncilation"" is nothing more than a euphemism for ""teaching"" the oppressed to ""forgive and forget;"" oh so rewarding and essential in today's society. Obviously, this book angered me."
2,ok - but could be better,"I agree with the other reviewer that it does block vision out the back window. I have trouble at night. The suction cups have not been staying put and that is annoying. It does, however, block the sun and provide shade inthe back of the car."
2,Suncutter so-so,"Okay, so I have looked all around for rear window shades and decided upon this one. I bought it for it's width, it was the widest one I've found. Alas, it was not to be...I found it to still be too small for the window and vision during the day and night was a problem. The main problem I had with this shade is that it did not block the sun for my son. He would turn away because the sun was in his face. I got in the back seat and tried it out too and had to squint because of the sun.I think an improvement for all window shades is to make them square AND long."
5,totally agree with the..........,"other reviewer here on this piece.I was hot on 'Nefertiti',track 3.On Phil? Just buy all his cd's THEN read reviews.All his little big band stuff is GREAT and quite peppy!"
5,What a master of words,"I don't think I am qualified enough (in Literature) to even comprehend the full meaning of every poem, but his gift is apparent from the first one's. He had an amazing eye for things in life most people will never care to even notice, and he had the talent to put forth those images and feelings in writing. No wonder he is hailed has one of the greatest literary minds in India. for people who want to explore more about Tagore, poetry wasn't his talent..he was a writer (plays and novels), a composer, an artist, and a Humanitarian."
2,game unable to play,"I am not very versed when it comes to play stations (games in general) so I ordered the grand theft auto classic collection for playstation 2 thinking that is all i needed, now the game is asking me to insert play station 2 disk when i put it in. When I look on the packaging it says i need to use it with the original grand theft auto. I really do not know what to do."
4,Very Cool Live Performance Of Bon Jovi,well..the concert was beautiful you can hear the bon jovi quality in every song..but the dvd could be better..the picture quality is average..I have seen other concerts in dvd and they were better. but anyway this dvd is a MUST have for The Jovi Fans..
2,really disappointing,"I had checked this book out of the library before and returned it without reading it. I couldn't for the life of me remember why I had done so, because I usually like this author's work. So recently I checked it out again. It didn't take more than a few pages for me to remember why I had given up before. This novel never gets started. The most exciting page is the first one and then Oates begins to ramble. And ramble.Don't get me wrong, I adore this author. I have inhaled everything else she has ever written. But there is much better to be found in ""Oates Country"" than this.I have given this novel two stars for the quality of the writing and phrasing. Very few can craft a sentence better than Oates. However, this novel doesn't move beyond the pretty sentences, for me anyway.However, thankfully, there are better Oates novels from which to choose. Try out We Were The Mulvaneys, Foxfire or My Heart Laid Bare instead."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOASTER,"I cannot stand this toaster!First of all, you MUST preheat it for a couple of minutes or it will not toast.THEN, you must watch your toast or waffle like a hawk because a couple of seconds is the difference between acceptable toasting and incineration.AND, if you really want things toasted uniformly then you really should rotate your toast 180 degrees half way through since the side facing inward gets toasted much faster than those facing outward.WHAT a ROYAL pain! Who cares if it IS indestructable! I keep hoping mine will die (it was a gift from my husband) so I can get a different toaster....maybe I will *accidentally* drop it off the roof..."
2,...if it would just toast!,"Like others, I was a bit amazed by the price of the Dualit toasters, but after reading the reviews-and experiencing the results of some $25 toasters-I made the bite.It was a great toaster. I liked the style; the manual lift was nice, and I especially liked the timer. But, let's see: as I remember I was trying to find a machine that would make good toast. Unfortunately, my Dualit 2-slicer didn't cut the mustard. Didn't make good toast either: dark on one side, light on the other; with the ""one-slice"" button poked (by mistake), the results were descending-first slice dark on one side, medium on the other; second slice light one side, just warm the other. It's going back. I'm sure glad I bought the thing from Amazon, where returns really are ""no-hassle.""So, ratings? Style/appearance/features = 5; toast = 2. It's toast!"
5,a perfect bedtime read,"I borrowed this book from the library for my 2 1/2 yr old son. It's requested not only every night but during the day. The story is a delight to read and the illustrations wonderful, enchanting. I am looking forward to adding this to my son's bookshelf."
1,This ya one some baaaaad dub,"With names like Lee Perry and Bullwackie, you'd expect this to be a nice combination of dub styles. BUT ITS NOT. This whole CD is done with drum machines and keyboards on the horn setting. No minor chord progressions, this CD is happy dub (weak!). Only one song is decent, Ooh La La Dub, taken from a previous recording session, with live drums and horns. Don't buy this CD, buy blackboard jungle dub."
5,GREAT WALL SCONCES!!!,"We ordered 2 of these to make a matching set. They arrived quickly after ordering them and in perfect shape. They matched perfectly with our wrought iron bed frame and the pair looked great on either side of the bed. They make great reading lights and nice room lights. I love the swivel of each lamp individually, it makes for great control of where the light goes. Easy to install, my husband had them up in no time. These are great because it freed-up space on our night-stands. Also another great feature is that the switch turns each lamp on one at a time, first the right one then the left one and then both together for maximum lighting. The bronze is a perfect match for our bed! I didn't know it was going to match so perfectly and look so good! We use energy effecient bulbs with these and they look great!"
4,Stunning debut from LaBradford guitarist Mark Nelson,"Dubbed out bossa nova slowed down to the point of stasis. Half-whispered vocals like aural hallucinations. The sound of flickering neon beginning to fuse. Bursts of radio interference. Carefully crafted, resolutely rhythmic, a stunning debut."
1,Waste of money,"We bought this batcave for our 5 year old who loves his other batcave, joker houses, castles and superheroes....this cave is junk, it is small, it is boring and it arrived in a old worn and torn box....appeared as if it was dragged out of someone's basement junk. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this cave."
4,fats navarro cd,This CD is a very comprehesive review of a great jazz musician who died very young and should not be forgotten.
4,Good new recordings from Three Dog Night,"First of all, if someone is going to buy an album of new recordings from a band thats been around for 40 years there is a very good chance some of the original members wont be on it. Buyers should do a little more research in these types of situations. The current version of Three Dog Night has been together for quite a while now. I was quite impressed with the new studio versions of the classic hits. The symphony sounds great on BLACK & WHITE and OUT IN THE COUNTRY particularly. LIAR & MAMA TOLD ME NOT COME rock harder than expected. Speaking of unexpected, the new song OVERGROUND is terrific, if it had made it onto radio I think alot of people would've been impressed. I would have liked a new studio version of ELI'S COMING instead of a live version but overall i'm more than happy with this cd. Of course I would love to see Chuck (and floyd) back in the band but i'm glad Cory & Danny are keeping the Three Dog Night name alive......and very well I might add."
1,Not Impressed,"I baught this hair brush because I wanted one which would not be too hard on my delicate care, but this brush is rediculously too soft. Its like brushing my hair with ""human hair"". I have since baught a Goody brush at Safeway supermarket for half what I paid for this one and I am extremely happy with it, as it is also 100% Boar Bristle but has a medium texture. If you are looking for a hair brush which is almost as soft as a baby brush then this ACE brush is for you. If not, I don't recommend it."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I saw this book in a store and thought it sounded like a good book, so I bought it. I know other people on this site who wrote that this was an excellent book, but I hated it! There was some action but most of the book was boring and predictable. I would NOT buy this book."
5,Car Magazine for the rest of us.,"GRM is a car magazine for the rest of us. There are lots of great articles about fixing up that autocross or race car, and it isn't just bling. The articles are based on products and techniques that work, and not just advertising sponsors. Truly a great read, I am excited every time I see it in the mailbox."
5,A must read for ANY auto enthusiast,"Grassroots Motorsorts is unique on the magazine rack in that it is not owned by some large conglomerate, it is not 80% ads for neon lights and the writers and publishers actually care and are involved in the material they write about. You will find excellent articles on all types of racing, including how to get involved, profiles of people who are racing, the cars that are racing and more. There are technical articles about all sorts of practical and useful topics, and the focus is on ""real"" cars not Italian Supercars you will never afford. The projects cars are Mustangs, Hondas, Nissans...actual cars you would buy. The writing is well done and honest, the layout is excellent and the photograhpy is top-notch.Do yourself a favor, subscribe!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"Much better to spend your money on a proffesional who could give you accurate advice about your particular lawn. Falls very short in actually delivering the reader enough accurate and useful, information."
4,Does its job!,"You definitely taste the ginger in this one! I like that it is ginger with chamomile, it certainly soothes the digestive system and has a calming effect. You won't go wrong with it."
4,"Started out kinda dull, but got much better","This book was about a girl who lived with her grandmother, who believed in the super natural. The plot is kind of hard to explain, so I can't really summarize it that well, but the beginning was pretty boring, and there wasn't much going on. After the girl was admitted to the hospital though, it got much better, and the things she started remembering were really neat. I felt really sorry for the girl, and kind of related to her, so it was fun to read. I don't think it's as good as Nolan's A Face in Every Window, though. I would still recommend it."
2,4 star product with zero-star service,"Good product we have been very happy with...right up to the time the power button broke. We've only had this unit for six months, so of course I expected it would be covered under the warranty. Wrong. RCA doesn't warranty any of the buttons to actually function on their products once you open the box, as far as I can tell from speaking with Thomson service (after I had to hunt down someone at RCA/Thomson who could help.) I'll be buying another brand in the future."
3,Thrash forgotten by time.,"I got this CD out of a clearance bin sometime around 1996 and felt quite justified for the purchase. Around the time of it's release grunge's hold on the hard music industry was so firm that it was starting to choke out many other metallic subgenres that flirted with mainstream success. Thrash was one of those subgenres, and thrash is what you're getting on this album. The sort of thrash that had evolved slightly from the Bay Area style of the 80s and incorporated a helping of groove. Fans of Zoetrope, Mordred, Uncle Slam, Catalepsy etc. would probably dig this. Also a worthy find for metalheads on a budget."
3,A bit disappointing,"I purchased this awhile back and while the music selection is good with unreleased goodies and the remastering was well done, there's this annoying DJ-like introduction to the songs. There's this great acustic version of Angel that I wanted to convert to Mp3, but it's ruined by a ...DJ voice-over at the end. I have no idea why they did that."
1,man oh man,"i didnt go to my high school prom, and i wish i hadnt gone to this one either. this film bores even the pre-teens it was designed to appeal to! id give a critique of the story if there was one. dont get it confused with the 1980 film of the same name thats far superior than this trash that probably started as ""hey mr. executive, please let me make a movie and i'll babysit your kids for free this weekend""."
1,I begrudingly give this one star because I had no choice in the matter!,"Awful, deplorable, terrible, even these words don't accurately describe how much of a waste of time this movie is. It feels like a really creepy episode of Dawson's creek, except that it would have been better with that cast. The first victim in this movie is the suspense as you see the killer in the first five minutes, we then see him all cleaned up some time later at the lead girls Prom killing systematically everyone who crosses his path. Why is he doing all this??? Good question, they never explain why so don't hold your breath. There is no plot, no back story, no point. Donot buy this movie!!! Please. I wish I could underline the word please."
1,Thumbs down.,I recieved this item today. It was broken to pieces for one thing. Another was it was used. I did not buy a used version of this dvd. Thumbs down big time on this one.
1,Oh my goodness,"I saw the unrated version on dvd and it was bad. I cant imagine what the PG-13 version was like. Truthfully, the movie wasnt awful, but it just wasnt good."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I'm glad I checked this out from the library. Awful book. Terribly written by an arrogant ""doctor""--boy, did she ever love throwing that 'achievement' around. The book made no sense whatsoever, wandered around the map, and she denigrated every professional involved in the serial killer business (except herself of course)! Please don't waste your money!"
1,Gacy was XYY,"In the book, the author states that Gacy was XXY, when he was XYY. These conditions are almost opposite."
4,Recloose  - So This Is The Dining Room,"Recloose's debut EP, SO THIS IS THE DINING ROOM, hits like an angry yeti, just as the jazzy intro ""Welcome"" brings you into the world, and ""Dencity"" scratches the jazz firmly into your consciousness. But the beats come out on ""MY230 (R.I.P.),"" which has moody style to spare, especially once the main melody kicks in halfway through. ""Dislocate"" shifts into breaks and lets loose the horns. Though this is just a taster of his talents, it makes you want to see the rest of the house."
2,Poor picture quality,"First of all, we love VeggieTales! However, the picture quality on this DVD is terrible. It actually appears that the DVD was created by recording from a VHS. Do you remember how little white lines appeared when your tape was having ""tracking"" issues? This DVD has those too! Thanks for the blast of nostalgia, but I'm a little concerned that this is a pirated copy of Veggie Tales."
4,Excellent,"Dave and the Giant Pickle - 5/5 One of those veggietales that you think to yourself, ""When will this be on dvd?""Ester, the Girl Who Became Queen - 2.5/5 not my favorite veggietales, but it has it's moments.Daniel and the Lions Den - 4/5 it has a few great musical performances and conversations.This was sort of a ""compilation"" of Veggietales that was released on VHS in 1996. Dave in the giant picckle is a 30 minute episode, as is Ester. Daniel is only 15 minutes, but for the price, your paying only a little bit more for two and a half times the running time as opposed to the other videos and dvd's. I really can't wait. Seing the other veggie's on dvd, I'm sure this will have much imroved sound and slightyly improved picture. Feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback. God Bless America!"
2,Worst in the series . . .,"I found this Outer Limits book very boring. I just could not get into it, which surprised me, since most all of the books in this series grab me by the first page, and if not, than by the end of the first chapter. This was not the case with this one. Even the ""climax"" was uneventful. The first time I started to read it, I put it down after chapter one, and decided not to read it. I only read the whole thing because it was the only thing I could find. If you want to read this book, check it out of a library. It's a total waste of money."
2,Check before you buy it,"when I first sprayed Bucheron on my wrist, it stayed more than 10 hours. That was convincing ! I bought it same day from amazon. The product I got, either aproaching out of date or something I don't know. Even after 6-8 sprays, it's just gone after couple hours ! At least for this cologne, I must say: I am disappointed ! I am not using it, kept it as a showpiece in my cologne library."
1,fraud,"its pure alcohol after 5 sprays , theres no more cologne scent. Dont waste your money it looks like a real good deal but its not"
5,A Great Video from a Great Band,This video is for all Hanson fans. It's gives you a look at what life is like for them on the road. You get to see their live performances and what they do on the bus.
4,how to build,"book was good ,it lacked some info on the suspetion.Auther has some info and pictures on the internet that might be helpful also.The auther did not build his own frame but purchased it,one area i was intersted in. But all things considered it was very helpful in building my car."
5,Very Helpful High Quality Book!,"I just finished reading the book from cover to cover. The book has a VBScript/Access/SQL Server slant, and I'm using JavaScript and Oracle, but all of the concepts translate well into whatever scripting or database system you use. The sample code always seemed to be right on the money for explaining the concepts. Although the examples weren't complex, they did illustrate more complex topics in a simple implementation. The chapter on the ""Sailors Case Study"" provided a vey good example of a complete Web application using cookies and logins and registration and so forth that would serve as a basis for more complete sites. I got a lot out of the book and even though it's 800 pages or so, it's an interesting read from beginning to end. Good stuff!"
2,Orchard Fresh Gifts Since 1942?,"If they're 64 years old, no wonder they taste horrible. The gold one ruined the whole expereince. :("
2,"Original artists, BUT rerecorded","Rerecorded Hits by the original singer, Age makes a difference. Most of the songs are almost unrecognizable from the original hit"
1,Bad Book,"Dont but this book. It is just the rantings of another dumb entitlement culture geek mad because G Bush was not immediatly in New Orleans wiping peoples butts for them and handing out hundred dollar bills. Poorly written, sophmooric, double spaced, so your getting half a book. Its hard to read through the authors sweaty sex fantacies. I was in New Orleans during this event...I listened to the only operating radio station. The events the author described regarding Nagans interview did not happen. In fact, the people operating the radio station pleaded for any public officials to come forward, None did."
2,"Beautiful, Failed after 18 months","The kettle performed flawlessly for over a year, then failed to completely boil water. A replacement base unit provided 4 more weeks of life, before the failure recurred.US Customer service was a disappointment.Recommend an alternate brand."
5,Digital theory and practice using integrated circuits,"I need it to read because is fr my school, i wanted to search some information about digital sistems,"
3,How I Passed,"That should be 5 stars... Having zero financial background, I researched all the book reviews and decided to go with the book and CDrom available directly from Kaplan (purchased Dearborn). They sell their newest, second edition direct from their website as a bundle with the CDrom. I also used a book and audio CD set from ""Pass The 7"" (Robert Walker). I read each section from both books, then used the practice exams on Kaplan's CDrom to identify areas of weakness, and went back to re-read those topics. I listened to the audio CD's in the car constantly. I did full-length, 250 question practice exams each day for 10 days and went back to re-read areas of weakness. I studied part-time (about 2 hours a day on average) for 3 months (I have a busy life and a family) and ended up getting an 86% on the real thing in a little under 4 hours. I felt well-prepared doing it the way I did. 66% of test-takers passed in 2006 with an average score of 73%. I didn't do too badly :)"
1,disappointed,"Of course, all Bones episodes are great. This collection is disappointing because it is incomplete. the disks do not have all the episodes listed on the jackets, missing about 30%. the image also goes light and dark constantly, mostly dark."
1,terrible!,"Still Smokin' is too bad for the first half,then it goes [down the drain].It becomes unfunny and uninteresting.The stand up is horrible.If you want Cheech and Chong doing their comedy routine buy one of their CD's instead of this film.If you're looking for a good Cheech and Chong movie check out ""Up in Smoke"" or ""Nice Dreams""."
1,Cheech&chongs/ Still Smoking,This movie was Some What A Disappointment.It Wasn't As Funny As Their Other Movies.The Scene Was In A Foriegn Country.And Just Wasn't To Funny.
1,Cheech & Chong's Worst Movie,"Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong exhaust their audience goodwill with this glorified home movie shot in fun-filled Amsterdam. Barely released in 1983, ""Still Smokin"" represents the absolute nadir of the team's film career. The so-called ""plot"" fits on the back of a match box, with no laughs or production values in sight. Allegedly directed by Chong, who lets the camera run for endless stretches of boredom. Someone should have smoked the negative."
4,good,This was a good book overall. I really like Wendy Mass. I was probably a little too young yet so probably wait until you are at least 13 or 14 to read it.
3,"Good ,but not what I expected",MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSthe good: this was interesting story about a girl who was born on leap day. It was a good book because it was the kind of book I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. I also liked how one chapter was how she saw it and the other happened as it really was (this went on through out the whole book).the bad: I really didn't like how the whole entire book lead up to the night at the beach and then it was only a game of truth or dare?! I also hated how it was all so clickyOverall the book was ok.
5,i loved this book!!!!,this was one of the best books ive ever read.it was about this girl named josie who is turning 16 and its all about her day. {ok i know that makes it soun really boring but its not. its really quite intruging} i was texting my friend and telling her that i was thinking about getting a wendy mass book and if she had any suggesstions almost imiditly after i sent the messege she replyed:YES!!!!!! READ LEAP DAY ITS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i replyed: o....k....? so later i piked up leap day from the store and couldent put it down i was so mad when my kindle ran out of battery because i couldent read leap day. i would reccomend leap day for any GIRL 11-18 becuse its a good book but i dont think kids under 11 woud understand it verrywell thanks for reading!!!!!!!!!!!~Sydney Spencer
4,The merriest way to learn about Alexander the Great.,It makes for an uproarious read. I never laughed so hard. The reader can be assured that the author always clearly define the historical from the hilarious. I highly recommend this book.
2,Pass on this one,"Too small to be of use for me. I found it much too small for even regular sized breads. Never tried it with pitas or folded tortillas as suggested by another review. Currently, its just taking up space in my gadget closet. Save your money and buy the toasting rack instead."
2,"Some good advice, but lacks a sense of reality","While I am generally in favor of treating children like adults and helping them to become independent, the advice contained in this book could create a sociopath in a single child family and complete civil war in a household with more than one child. The author's advice with respect to issues of sexuality would be frightening to most parents."
2,Save your money,I purchased this impact wrench because I wanted a tool to remove the lug nuts on my car when a pneumatic tool wasn't available. This tool is worthless at that task. It makes a tremendous amount of noise and achieves nothing. I strongly recommend against this tool based on its very poor performance.
5,The story is realistic and poignant.,"I would recommend this book to middle school students. It's about Hispanic teenage girls and women who face opposition in school, work, and the community. The story allows for elaborate discussions on racism, discrimination, friendship, family, goals, and determination. This is the author's first published children's book. Check it out!"
2,Stick with the first set!,"Although a bit humorous, Vol 4-6 were nowhere near as funny as Vol. 1-3. One show was down-right depressing. I'm bloody near ready to send them back! I counted my laughs on one hand."

3,"Good, but not Beagle's Best","I'm in agreement with several other reviewers of ""The Innkeeper's Song."" Without a doubt, Peter S. Beagle is an outstanding writer who never ceases to offer up surprising, on-target yet offbeat descriptions and analogies that leap off the page like fleas and take me by delighted surprise. Unlike my other two Beagle favorites, ""A Fine and Private Place"" and ""The Folk of the Air,"" however, ""The Innkeeper's Song"" just didn't hold together for me. The climactic good-vs.-evil scene in which the Fox revealed his true nature (which was...what?) and Lukassa transformed into...what? was vague and unsatisfying. I shouldn't read through 300+ pages and be left wondering...what exactly happened back there? I do think Beagle used well the device of telling his tale from the various characters' POVs. I just wish there had been a more definite resolution to the tale."
5,"Weird, troubling, touching, beautiful, unforgettable","Peter Beagle has a reputation as a young adult's author -- why, I'll never know. I didn't much like him as a teenager, but the older I get, the more I admire and enjoy his fantasies. The Innkeeper's Song is a beautiful book, but certainly better for 30 than 13 -- unless, perhaps, for a 13-year-old who has already had to deal with death. It concerns attempts to cheat death by magic, and the strange and unforeseen consequences, both good and ill, of raising a drowned young woman from the dead. The book is also noteworthy for a varied and unforgettable cast of characters who take turns narrating the story, giving the reader many perspectives on the same events and aiding suspense by concealing certain facts until the narrator shifts to someone in the know. Beagle's writing is so beautiful it's practically musical. I recommend this book highly to anyone who loves fantasy, folklore, mythology, and the grand old tradition of storytelling."
4,A great knock about farce!!,"John Candy and Dan Aykroyd pair together in this compelling knock about farce about a man's holiday with his family interupted by his brother in law ,with hilairious results.Both candy and Aykroyd are superb in their roles, with the comic timing just spot on.This has to be one of the great 'out in the sticks' comedys, anyone wishing to exercise their funny bone, be sure to have this near the top of your viewing list."
5,Good ol classic,"I loved this movie growing up and recently my 6 year old nephew watched it (minus one scene in beginning), and he had to own it. So this was a gift for him, and he probably still belly laughs like I do at the waterskiing scene."
5,Review of The Great Outdoors,"This movie has been one of my favorites of John Candy. It has lots of action and lots of comedy. I bought it for my 2 year old and he loves it. He watches it almost everynight before he goes to bed. If you like to laugh and love the outdoors buy this movie. John Candy RIP. You were the best man, miss you."
3,I see the underdeveloped resources of northern Minnesota...,"This movie is a guilty pleasure, but I have to confess I like it. I admit that the storyline is cheesy at times, but Dan Ackroyd is hysterical in this flick. He is so obnoxious you can't help but sympathize with John Candy's character. There are too many great lines uttered by the know it all Roman Craig to mention, but my favorites are uttered when an obviously hammered Roman lectures the bartender at the lodge about fishing and investing. Priceless. The ""Old 96er"" scene also deserves honorable mention. Definitely a fun movie."
4,great movie,I love this movie and just wanted to be able to watch it again and again. You can't go wrong if you are not looking for a special edition.
2,I want to like it.,I remember watching this movie when I was younger. I remember Great Outdoors being a very funny movie. After so many years I finally get to watch it again. I guess my memorise of the movie made it better then it really was. I was not happy how it turned out after a few years later.
2,Not so family friendly,"I thought this would be a fun film to watch with a couple of other families while on a group vacation at the lake. WRONG. The adults/teens would have gotten a kick out of it, but this film was inappropriate for the kids under 14 traveling with us. (There were 7 of them, so I really made a bad choice.) The real problems for us were the foul language and sexual suggestions. (My husband says I should have known that due to the actors in the film. ha. ooops.) We are surprised this did not have a PG-13 rating instead of the PG printed on the packaging."
5,Great Movie,Loved it!!! One of John Candy's all time best. I rented this so my nephews could watch it right before we were going camping. They laughed so hard and when they got home they rented it again.
5,I enjoyed this a lot!,"While this movie is typical 80s slaptstick with a bit teenage romance, it is a wholesome movie and funny at that.The plot definetely contrasts the family man (played by John Candy)vs. the 80s YUPPIE (Akroyd). Underneath all the nonsense, luckily the message of this movie is that family is more important.I recommend this to anyone."
5,Enlightening and entertaining social history,"This is one of my favorite books. Lambert uses first person interviews and historical research to craft a beautifully written portrait of the last gasp of the debutante system in Britain before WWII. The details make you feel like you were there and the biographies of the ""girls"" who took part are fascinating. A bit on the Kennedy girls too, who were in England with their father Ambassador Joe Kennedy, if you are interested. Photos are great, I just wish there were more of them since the author frequently talks about the scrapbooks she was given to look at during her research."
3,"Not so bad, not so good.","I represented Jerry Iger, the creator of Sheena Queen of the Jungle, when he was an old man.The writer here is not so familiar with the entire run of the comic. Sheena became a stronger figure as the book progressed and the book became less racist,but far from enlightened.Judging from that perspective I think that this book while entertaining does not reflect a real depth of knowledge of the subject. On the other hand for the casual reader it should be just fine."
1,sucked,"i thought i would really dig this movie so i ordered it thinking cool cant wait for it to come in. once i got it and watched it i was like this is stupid. im a big sci fi fan and love lots of different movies, but trust me your dvd collection is better off without this in it, and if you dont listen to me and oreder it anyways, youll watch it and think yep he was right this movie sucks."
2,"A Necessity for Some Future Appraisers, But......","This work is truly a monument to poor and opaque writing, haphazard organization, shoddy -- even wretched -- editing, and user-hostile print format. Important concepts are not only buried deep in badly-written, run-on sentences, but the author often makes casual assumptions concerning the reader's ""base"" knowledge. Unfortunately, this book is required by a number of states in the training of future real estate appraisers. With over 17 years college teaching experience, I am frankly shocked -- and disappointed -- that this tome would be so widely used as a required text. If you find yourself forced to use this tome, make SURE you compliment it with other real estate appraisal books AND the latest edition of the Appraisal Institute's Dictionary of Appraisal Terms. Simply awful...."
4,Owen is a great songwriter. Great band!,This is one of the best Irish-American CD's I've heard in a long time
1,FLACCID AND FLAT,"What sounds awfully amusing ends up, well, flaccid. Two gents from Down Under show off the mastery of bending and folding and manipulating their ample appendages in an assortment of shapes. An evening of genital origami? Prick me when it's over."
3,"Could have been so much more, but fell a little short.","I bought this book looking for an author to substitute for Michael Crichton. Unfortunately, there is no substitute for Mr. Crichton. The book had an intriguing premise but was bogged down in explanations of historic facts/mythology. While I like a well researched book, something about the way Alten presents it makes the reader feel they are studying up on the subject for an exam or something similar. I also found it incredibly frustrating that the same explanation had to be provided 2-3 times by other characters, etc. Overall I have certainly read worse, but this just wasn't what I was looking for."
5,"Awesome, loved it!","Once again, Alten has kept me hooked on his books. I just love the characters, so human, so original, so real. He manages to create a quite believable tale of adventure and terror, history and myth and something to think about. I liked Michael's strenght, Dom's intuition and Ennis Chaney's personality (totally not that of your typical politician.) Are we ready to open our minds and hearts to a new era? are we ready to really care for one another and our planet? This is more than a thrilling novel, it is a wake up call."
1,another TOR bomb,"I've just got through Domain and what a piece of trash - in fact, I've just noticed that the last three books I've read were TOR-published books and they were all terrible. Is anybody going to put us out of our misery? Domain is poorly written, poorly thought thru (all present tense) and the characters were like cardboard. Oh, excuse, me ARE like cardboard (maybe I should underline it). I'm going to start boycotting TOR books, they're not only ridiculous and unbelievable, they're written by amateurs."
