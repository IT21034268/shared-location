3,"Good book, but not anything special","The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings series, is a very well written book, but I recommend it only for those who are truly fans of fantasy books. Tolkein does a very well at describing the adventure of Bilbo and his companions, but sometimes he gets too descriptive and the book gets a little dull. Still, other parts in the book are very exciting. I ended up enjoying this book very much, but I have read better books. Overall, I don't consider this one of Tolkein's best literary works, but it deserves some recognition."
3,Good for movie preview,"Story highly edited, but reasonable preview for the movie. The narration is good, but i found the sound quality uneven."
2,wrong book cover,"I ordered the book because I lost my childhood copy of the ""Hobbit"". They advertise this cover and received a completely different cover copy of the book. Very upsetting. I was looking for this particular edition."
4,Snyopsis,"Poor Bilbo Baggins! Once a short, rather plump gentlmen (as hobbits tend to be) he suddenly finds himself whisked off on an adventure as a burglar by the wizard Gandalf and travels with 13 dwarves into the dangerous Wilderland where a dragon named Smaug hoards a vast treasure stolen from men centuries ago. The dwarves and Bilbo are determined to return it to the men, but not without dangers such as trolls, giant spiders, goblins, and wolves. A classic fantasy!!"
3,"Great reading, great story but horrible disc quality.",The title says it all. Great read by the narrator amazing story for young and old but the company that printed the discs did a terrible job I tried to play the discs on my Bose CD player and I can't get 20 minutes without the audio freezing. I got around this by putting all the CDs on my computer in iTunes and listening to it there. There is some minor audio skipping but it's barely noticeable when I play it on my IPod. BUT I REPEAT THESE DISCS WILL NOT PLAY ON CD PLAYER!!! Do not purchase unless you intend to put it on your computer. I'm giving it only 3 stars for the disc quality if this wasn't an issue it would be a solid 5 STARS!!
5,An excellent and very well written book!!,"The Hobbit is a great novel that includes fantasy, aventure, suspense and occasional comedy. So why don't you grab The Hobbit and sing along with a joyful hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf a wizard and a band of friendly dwarves as they sing and dance all the way to the lair of a powerful and very deadly dragon named Smaug the Magnificent. I don't think any bookshelf should stand without this wonderful novel."
5,The Hobbit is cool no matter what anyone sez.,"The hobbit was a very exciting book, it might have been slow to start but when it did it was great. I can't stand how people gave it a 1 because they had to read it, you would have liked it if you weren't forced to read it."
5,enchanting and captivating,"This was the sole book that got me into reading books. i used to really struggle finding a novel that impressed me enough to captivate me into reading it through. and this one did it, the book is so well written, and i believe the story was created for Tolkein's kids. The book is a prequel to 'The Lord of The Rings' however it is not quite as dark as that series, this story is much more beautiful and light hearted. you will find yourself laughing with and growing attached to the characters within the book.I would recommend this book to all ages, and i do."
2,Alright...,"With The Lord of the Rings comming out I picked up The Hobbit about three weeks ago and tried to read it. I thought I would be able to at least get to The Fellowship of the Ring so I could try to go see the movie this Christmas break (I'm a pretty fast reader for a fourteen year old girl). However I'm just reaching page 250 in this book and though everyone promised me it would get interesting I'm still waiting.I find Bilbo an interesting character but quite frankly he didn't pull at me like characters such as Harry Potter and Novalee Nation. And Gandalf annoyed me more than I can express. Though I'm not finished with the book, I must say I hope that The Fellowship of the Ring is plenty better."
1,One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read,"All I've heard about is how highly acclaimed the book ""The Hobbit"" is, but I completely disagree. This is one of the most boring, over-rated, and tedious books I have ever read. What even possess a person to say it is the best book they have ever read is beyond me."
5,--,"I generally do not read books if there is a possibility of a movie being made on the same. However, this is a really very interesting book. You can not keep it down once you start reading."
5,Wonderful book!,"This book came just as described, if not better. This was a fabulous wedding anniversary gift for my husband, love it!!"
4,good recording,I looked around quite a bit and read reviews before buying this version. I'm satisfied with it. I think it's well done.
5,Exciting read,Wanted to read the book before the movie was released....I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very funny at times. Looking forward to seeing it on the big screen!
4,Review of The Hobbit,"I read this book a long time ago - 1974-ish - and thought it an interesting fictional tale of a land of orcs, dwarves, elves, hobbits, wizards and humans. It certainly whet my appetite for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. I re-read this book (I could not find my original copy) and again enjoyed the tale. It refreshed the story in my mind as I look forward to seeing the movie by Peter Jackson, due to be released in a few days. This whole story is the pre-courser to the Lord of the Rings, and help that trilogy make more sense as you now know what adventures lead up to that follow-on masterpiece. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote a very entertaining tale about a Hobbit (half-sized human, of sorts), who steps out of the usual mold of Hobbit behaviour to join a band of 13 dwarves who are off to recover their stolen treasure from a dragon. The story is light reading, and very enjoyable!"
5,"""The Hobbit"" -a review by Jacob Stevens-Lubin","I thought that the hobbit was a great novel. Most adults should like it, and all children should. It was a great adventure story that inspired thousands of other books.In my opinion, the hobbit is better than the lord of the rings.JRR TOlkein is, ofcourse my favorite writer, and I have read all of his novels.If you liked the hobbit, you should read:""The Hobbit"" again...""The Lord of the Rings""""On Fairy Storys""""The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth""""The Adventures of Tom Bombadil""""The Road Goes Ever On and On""""The Silmarilion""""Pictures by J.R.R Tolkien""""Unfinished Tales""""Roverandom""""The History of Middle-Earth, by Christopher Tolkien""All of theseare about Middle Earth."
5,JRR TOLKIEN IS BEST,The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings remain unsurpassed as the best fantasty books ever written. Tolkien is captivating and his style is simple yet superior to any author at any tim
3,Most of the annotations are wasted.,"This is my third ""Annotated"" book -- following The Annotated Alice and Annotated Fairy Tales -- and while The Hobbit itself is great, the majority of the annotations add no value to the story as they merely mark where a word or two was changed between editions. Unfortunately, there's so many of them that they frequently appear a couple of pages after they're noted so you have to turn forward to find out that ""South"" was changed to ""Southwest"" and then you've broken the flow of the story. The Hobbit itself is a great read-aloud story and some of the annotations are surprising and interesting... but the mundane and boring annotations really weigh the book down compared to the annotations in Alice or Fairy Tales."
1,WRONG PICTURES ON PREVIEW!!!!,"The illustrations shown in the preview of this book are David Wenzel illustrations from his own illustrated version of The Hobbit. Very excellent they are, too -- but from a different illustrated version of ""The Hobbit."""
5,A Wonderful Story for all ages !,"The Hobibt by J.R.R. Tolkien's is a true masterpiece that I would reccomend to any reader. Tolkein has made a unique union between fantasy adventure, nature, and magic, by writing the hobbit, which tells the adventure of Bilbo Baggins and the crew of thirteen dwarves, and the grey mage Gandalf, to take the treasure of Smaug the great who stole the treasure from the dwarves long ago. This book does not have to be, but should be read before the others.C.M Whitlock's The Price of Immortality is highly recommended"
3,hobbit,"I did like the book, but I thought it was a bit boring in parts. Over all, I thought it was a good story. I liked how Bilbo got into the adventure. Also I loved the names. (: I think the author had a good ideas, but stretched them out too much."
4,A fine adventure,"A little ho bit is drafted into the service of 13 reserves and a wizard. Some goblins, spiders, wargs, elves, men, and a very old dragon later, his adventure leads to the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy. Well done, Mr. Baggins! Well done."
5,EXCELLENT PROLOGUE STORY!!!!,"This is a very good book for people who know how to analyzeintelligently. It is a battle of Good and Evil that only few canunderstand. This book is not for mediocre minds. Enjoy it and continue on with ""The Lord of the Rings"" and other J.R.R. Tolkien books."
5,Completely satisfied,"This was my first Kindle purchase and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy, quick and user-friendly the experience was. I read this on my Android smartphone using the free Kindle app. Quite a pleasant experience which I would be glad to repeat, and will!Regarding the book itself, if you haven't already read The Hobbit, I highly recommend it. Read and re-read it and even read it to your children as applicable and when they are ready."
5,Must Read Before You See the Movie,"Before you see the movie, read the book. I am hoping the movie will follow the story line closer than LOTR did. I first read this book in High School and I have read it many times since.Who should read it?Anyone that has watched LOTR and is wanting to watch the new movie. People that are into fantasy with a great story line.Who shouldn't read it?Not sure."
5,No need for a review,"This timeless story requres nothing else from me, other than to say that the images it invokes in the reader's mind cannot be portrayed on the silver screen, regardless of the talents of Hollywood's finest. I actually do not plan to see the movie because it could only disappoint."
5,A message to the people who critizised this book,"I have noticed that the people who have given this book a bad name have either had the book forced upon them by a teacher or just simply tried to be smart-asses. Like them, I guess you could say I too had the book 'forced' upon me by a teacher, but unlike them I thought that it was a god damn MASTERPIECE. I cannot believe how cold some people can be. It makes the rest of us, who have worshipped this book, feel really down to see people sink to such deph's. I hope they realize that The Hobbit was written by one of the greatest writers of our time. It is a book that will be rememberd for generations to come and all the people who spat on J.R.R Tolkiens work will be long forgotten. To anyone who is reading this message, pay no attention to those kind of people. Do not let them make you think differently about The Hobbit. Thank you for your time."
5,A classic,"What else is there to say? You can't go wrong with this one, it's got everything you could want from a adventure story."
4,A Great Classic,The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the illustrations and maps in the Kindle version are not as good as the printed book.
5,Good and Enjoyable reading,"When I saw the news that The Hobbit was coming into theaters soon, I realized that I'd never read the book. I enjoy reading, and especially Tolkiens works. I wasn't disappointed."
1,The Wrong Edition.,"I was looking forward to getting this book because I had seen it a while back but could never find it and when I finally received this, I was upset. I was sent the 50th anniversary edition of The Hobbit not what I ordered. as well as it was an old library book. the checkout card was still inside and had the library stamp on all sides of the books sides. Just know that the book in the image is not the book you'll receive. This was a very disappointing purchase."
4,Enjoyable Reading,"It was a pleasure to read. The adventures were cute and imaginative. I would recommend this book for others, it's a classic."
5,the book to read before lord of the rings,if you plan on reading LOTR than you should read this great book before you read it.
3,Do not buy this for your portable,"When I read the review that mentioned how this audio book was created to give the listener the feeling of an old time radio show, I did not realise the drawbacks of this format. The sound effects come across as low-buget and amature. The music drones on and on, with the vocals being so quiet and hard to hear. I ran tests on portable cassette and home theater. This book is acceptable if you have a powerful amplifier -- but any environment that has background noise (car, walking) this is not a good tape to try and listen to."
3,"Although Extremely Good, Still not the Best","I've always loved fantasy novels, and my friends have always told me that The Hobbit was a ""most read"", ok after several tries now I've read it and, don't get me wrong it's really good, but I don't think it's worth five of four stars. The descriptions of both settings and characters are very good, the story is extremely imaginative, but I think it's a very ""light"" adventures story because of all the perils Mr. Baggins (the Hobbit) and his dwarves companions encounter, there's not one in which you can really get concerned of what the outcome will be. I enjoyed it and never will regret reading it, but also think there are better fantasy novels, like the ones of Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman."
2,Rather Bland,"There is no action, no underlying them, it's too gory, but, it wasn't horrible. I personally could never get through it, but I've gotten about halfway various times, and I don't care for it. The reading level is about the same a Black Beauty, which I read in second grade. However, you never get to really like any characters, and there isn't any kind of theme. As Tolkein says, if you like there-and-back again kind of books, read the Hobbit. I would recommend it to middle school boys who enjoy action figures and role playing battle games. And people with no life and lots of time."
4,"Strait to the point, three paragragh summery","""The Hobbit"" written by J.R.R. Tolkien, is a great book for readers of all ages. This book is about a hobbit, some dwarfs and a wizard who take an wild adventure through the countryside. During the adventure they run into evil animals, insects, and even a dragon. The hobbit,BIlbo Baggins was accompinied with 15 dwarfs and a wizard named Gandolf. Gandolf helped them out of alot of situations but Bilbo ended up defeating the dragon on his own. This book was very good if you like adventurous funny books I recommend it to everyone"
5,Fantas-tic!,"I had heard so much from so many people about JRR Tolkien, his Hobbit, and his Lord of the Rings. I thought I'd buy the Hobbit and give it a shot. And then, I realized what I was missing all these years! Sure, Lord of the Rings is Tolkien's masterpiece (I myself am reading it right now), but the Hobbit is an excellent ""preface"" to it, and a magnificent fantasy story by itself! Reading this one, I NEVER found myself bored, but tucked deep in my seat, turning one page after another, feeling I just couldn't stop not even if a meteor hit me, I just wanted to see what happens next! It's very captivating, filled with action and very carefully written, the characters are great, and the plot is even greater. I'd recommend to *anyone* to just blindly buy it, and read it! And of course, when I finished the last page, and saw there was no more, I ran to my computer and placed an order for what is actually the Hobbit's sequel; The Lord Of The Rings!"
5,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is an awesome story of an adventure that will truly take your breath away. Bilbo Baggins -the hobbit and main character,sets out with 13 friends to fight a dragon and claim what is rightfully theirs. J.R.R. Tolkien writes this story in a way that you will never forget"
5,Memories in the making!,"With Peter Jackson's motion picture trilogy out this December, I thought I'd download the Kindle edition of The Hobbit and read it to my two young daughters beforehand. We are having lots of fun and they are excited to read with me every night! Great memories in the making! Thanks!"
3,Very Slow,"I have to admit this is the first time I've read The Hobbit and I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. I really wanted to love this book, but I just couldn't. And I know that so many Tolkien fans will think that that is just blasphemy!First of all, I thought it rambled too much and I had a really hard time getting through it. I can usually read a book in a couple of days but this one took me over a week; and it's not that long of a book. I thought the characters were a lot of fun and Bilbo is wonderful little hobbit. However, some of the descriptions of the journey were a bit tedious.Overall, I'm glad I finally read The Hobbit. I have already read The Fellowship of the Ring and I tried to read Two Towers, but I think I'm done with the Lord of the Rings. I gave it my best shot. It's just not my cup of tea."
5,Must-have for Tolkien fans,"This book is absolutely fantastic! My teen and pre-teen brothers think it's neat, my toddler sisters like me to read it to them while they look at the pictures, and I read it for fun. Excellently drawn, mostly word-for-word excerpts from the book... altogether excellent!"
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!,"This has to be the absolute WORST piece of ""literature"" I have ever read. I really like to read, but this is awful! The paragraphs are too long with no main sentence with a few detail sentences. They are 20-30 sentences long that are so boring it reminded me of the sweet relief that death would bring! So I repeat: If you can, don't read this novel!:-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo! :-( Boo!:-(""BOO FOR YOU HOBBIT!""""DIE HOBBITS, DIE!""""DEATH TO HOBBITS!"""
4,Read First,"If your are curious about the LOTR saga read this book first. I love this set, but the Trilogy moves at a slow pace. This book is a full adventure in one book. If you have trouble reading this I don't recommend you try and read the rest, but if you like this book and want to finish the story then by all means read the rest."
5,Simply amazing,"If you are a person who loves the themes or periods like you play most of the time in D&D you will love this book. I originally saw all of the Lord of the Rings movies first, along with the new Hobbit movie that came out this winter. I do have to say, the movie isn't as good as the book but it was pretty darn close. Tolkien uses his words in a way to intrigue the reader while making them think in a different patter and just sucks you into it. I loved it, and I do recommend reading this book."
5,The Hobbit (or There and Back Again),"It arrived in timely fashion, is brand-new, and in perfect condition. I have ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and I am looking forward to reading this book. I love Tolkien!"
5,Wonderful,"Of course it is a great book, I've read it many times and again recently before I go see the new movie. Perhaps I shall reread the rest for fun as well. If you've not read any Tolkien I highly recommend you get on it!"
5,Alan Lee Illustrated version,"Although it's difficult to overstate how significant Tolkien's work is, I won't try here. However, I would like to say that this Alan Lee illustrated edition is magnificient. The illustrations are beautiful and the print is bold and on thick glossy paper. In short, the physical quality of this book is superior to all other editions of The Hobbit I have seen, and I would highly recommend this book for anyone's personal library."
2,Slow,I read this book and it took me FOREVER it get through. I was really struggling to get through even a couple pages of this book. I know most people don't have a problem with it. But if you are looking for an easy book to read-- don't choose this one. I would suggest something like Harry Potter or a different book.
2,such a shame,"I thought this book was gonna be a great book, but i was wrong. Although it explains a few things in The Lord of the Rings, I expected a lot more action. It had it's comical moments, but that was about the extent of it. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,What an Adventure!,"Wow! While I was reading this book I continually asked myself ""why didn't I read this book any soon?"". It's great. I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre, but loving the Lord of the Rings movies, I wanted to read the books and began with this one. The story is jammed pack with action and really heroic moments. My favorite thing, however, is the writing. Tolkien just has a great way of writing and telling the story, and that is what really drew me into the book. I would highly recommend this book to anybody! especially those who are a fan of the movies and have not read the books!!"
3,the hobbit by JRR Tolkien,"The book 'The Hobbit' is a book about Bilbo Bagging. He has been chosen as a 14th person. It was goin to b 13 'little people' but 13 is a odd number so it's 14. Before Bilbo knew it he was off on an adventure. He goes of to slay a dragon.....who would actually do this? This is a fairytale story for old and young people. It is told in detail, it tells you more thigs than what you actually need to know. i think if you want to have a book you can start and not put down you should definately read this book!"
5,Great book,This is such a great book I love it. I recommend this book to everyone who likes adventures. Great book
2,Somewhat Overrated,"The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy."
5,the source,This is from where Tolkien's fame came to be. Must Read it if you are a lord of the rings fan.
1,FORGET IT!,"Unfortunately, I was subjected to read the first twenty or so pages of this book because I got it as a christmas present from my aunty. Not only that, I also received a compendium with the rotten book, which was of no use to me as I was not planning on ever reading it. Feel free to email me if you want this huge waste of time for free, though I strongly recomend you don't! This is a dangerous book and is an extremely bad influence on adolescents. Not only that, it is also more boring than having tea with nan and the relatives.DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, READ THIS BOOK!"
4,good gift,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my grandson.Having read the original, I enjoyed the Illustrated Edition very much! While it was abridged, it was done quite well. I highly recommend it."
4,Entertaining read.,"I have read all three Lords books, and in fact I read them before watching any of the movies. I enjoyed all three books more than the movies. this book most probably will be the same also, as it entertained me; it was an easy read, with the same style as the trilogy books. If you want to read a book that will not tire your brain, like after work, at night before bed, and you like the Lord of the Rings storyline, then its a good idea to buy, enjoy yet another JRRTolkien book."
5,wonderful- brought back memories of my youth,"I read this as s child. The upcoming movie prompted me to read it again, and I'm very glad I did."
5,A great story and prequel to the Lord of the Rings,Tolkien sets the stage for the Lord of the Rings with this tale of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure. A great tale from the master of fantasy. One will delight in the characters and history that Tolkien has created. From valiant characters like Gandalf and Thorin Oakenshield to villains like Smaug the Dragon and Gollum.Don't read the Lord of the Rings without first reading this book. It sets the stage and gives you great information to read the trilogy. This is a great book to whet your Tolkien appetite with. Read and enjoy!
5,The hobbit,You can never put it down when you start it there are so many adventures in this book you will enjoy this
3,I Prefer the movies,"It's a good book and all, but I'm not all into fantasy books that much. I think the movies are cool but really this is is most likely the only Lor book I'm gonna read. I'm more of a Harry potter kinda guy."
4,The Hobbit - Well written story,The Hobbit is a masterpice in letters. The pictures are very well detailed and are amazing to look at. J.R.R. Tolkien has written many books but this one is by far the best.
5,Great classic tale,It's the classic tale in an e-book format!!! Need I say more? It is very enjoyable on the Kindle App.
2,I believe that this book HAD the potential to be a good book,"In my opinion the author really messed up when he started dragging out sentences... For instance, in the first chapter when Bilbo had his visitors and it was time to wash the dishes instead of saying the dishes the author chose to name every single solitary dish(the plates,pots, pans, glasses, cups,etc.) I feel that he lost a lot of interest like that. In short this book could have been a very interesting 100 to 200 page book instead of a long drawn out 300 plus book (paperback)."
3,Not my favorite.,The book was okay. It was the book for book club. If I didn't need to finish it for book club I wouldn't have finished it at all.
3,Hard to read,"Tolkien's writing style is difficult to read. VERY detailed, almost to the extreme. I just find the books boring. Love the stories... but just can't get through the books."
2,Disappointed,"I expected an adventure similar to the grandeur of the ""Lord of the Rings"" and I am very disappointed. I have read 60% and the best I can say is that the plot is flat. Tolkien learned from his mistakes in this novel when he wrote the Ring Trilogy. This book is not worth purchasing."
1,Horrible,Wow .. this is the worst book I've ever read!! I would NEVER ever tell anyone to read this! It's just so weird and BORING. Don't waste your money! AHH .. I hated this book with a passion!
4,A good book but....,I was quite a good book a good adventurous book but... It wasn't what I expected of a prequel it had very little to do with the actual Lord of the Rings series except for a couple of chapters which jokingly showed similarities.It also had another feature where it had it being told in a bed time story type of manner almost Roald Dahlish. I did like this...but it sepirated it more and more from the original trilogy and made it quite kiddyish. All in all this is quite good as it's own book. but does not fit as a LOTR prequel.
4,Great Book,So much easier to read on my Kindle than in print. Much easier on my eyes and the light does not keep my wife up at night.
5,Take a journey into this book!,"Horrendus beasts, enchanted forests, bountiful treasures, this book has 'em all! The Hobbit is a great book about Bilbo Baggins' adventure to help some dwarves regain their treasure and land, gaurded by Smaug the dragon. Along the way they encounter a great many different beings, some friendly, some not. I liked the part about how Bilbo's great-great-granduncle who, by knocking off a goblin kings head, won a battle and created the game of golf at the same time. This book is a wonderful read for almost any person."
5,Bilbo Baggins and Martin Shaw - great friends!,"The Hobbit is such a charming story and Bilbo so endearing, who wouldn't enjoy having the book read to them. But when it's done by such a consummate performer as Martin Shaw! Heaven! It is truly truly ""preciousssss""."
5,Beautiful Edition,Bought this book for my 11 year old son at his request. He was ecstatic. He raved about the original illustrations inside the book and on the cover.
3,The Hobbit,"The first time I read The Hobbit was many years ago, and I decided I would like to read again before watching the move. I didn’t remember much about it except that I quite enjoyed it as a young child. This time I also enjoyed reading it, but to a lesser degree.Perhaps the best thing about The Hobbit is that it sets the stage of how Bilbo Baggins came to possess the Ring of Power, relating the necessary background for The Lord of the Rings. My main issue with The Hobbit is that it was, as opposed to The Lord of the Rings, specifically written for children. The plot is very predictable and told in a fairly childish manner, and lacks the more mature style of The Lord of the Rings."
4,Really good,"I really liked the Hobbit. I liked it alot more than the Lord of the Rings books. I started to read one of them and I couldn't get past the third chapter it was so boring and way to descriptive, I like description, but this book had just way too much. Any way the hobbit was good. I loved all of the mythical characters. It was like an adventure book combined with a fantasy. I really love fantasy it's my favorite genre. It's one of my favorite books."
4,Fun to reread!,"Always enjoy Tolkien. In anticipation of the new movie, I have reread this and enjoyed it once again. A must read!"
4,re-read the Hobbit,"I want to see the movie when it comes out, so I re-read the book. It doesn't read like the Lord of the Ring series, so many people might not like it... It answers questions about the Lord of the Rings that you might not know"
5,"The only unabridged audio reading of the Hobbit, and luckily it's a GREAT one","Rob Ingliss does a GREAT job of reading here. I've only heard him on the audio productions of Tolken's 4 books, and wouldn't mind hearing his other stuff.The Royal Shakespearean actors are well represented by Ingliss. He has a different voice for each character, and the voices aren't too hard to distinguish from each other, which is no mean feat for a single person. (kind of reminds me of Mel Blanc (Looney Tunes, Bugs Bunny & gang) in this regard).If you loved the Hobbit, you'll love this book on CD.Just don't make the mistake of setting your PC or CDPlayer to ""Random"", or you'll be just as confused as my new-to-Tolkien friend was when he first heard it."
5,Action Packed thriller!!!!!!!,I think the Hobbit is the Best book I've ever read. It has many adventures in it and I could go on all day about how many characters come into the story to make it even more interesting. My favorite part of the book was when Gollum (The Goblin) Meets the Hobbit and they go through a series of riddels to see who can outsmart who. I love this book and I hope you get to take the time to sit down and read it.
5,What a Gorgeous Book!,This book is a must have for Tolkien lovers (do I dare use the work Geek!). Beautiful pictures and drawing. Loads of info. Answers all your questions and adds tons to your trivia as well as concrete knowledge of the Hobbit and Tolkien.
5,Great book,"After seeing the movie I figured I would read the book and of course, I ended up enjoying the book much more than the movie!"
3,It's OK,Thank God for Peter Jackson. He took a so so story and turned it into a great movie trilogy. Saw the movie (part 1) and it was
5,Amazing!!!!!!!!,"Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!a close competitor with the original trilogy!!!!! I think that Tolkien out done himself, and so did Peter Jackson!!!!!"
4,"Revisiting ""The Hobbit""","I read ""The Hobbit"" a long time ago and loved it. Not it is available on Kindle - that makes it even more lovable! J. R. R. Tolkien has a way with words and a story that never grows old. Read it and enjoy it as much as I do!"
5,Great quality and reasonable quick in delivery.,It was in great condition (new) with great price and came in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you so much for your services.
2,Disappointing,"The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien, is mediocre at best. A hobbit of the shire named Bilbo Baggins, is sent on a quest by the Maiar Gandalf the Grey to help a group of Dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield in order to defeat Smaug the Dragon. This book is incredibly well-written, however, I find the story to be very stale and ordinary. I recommend this book as a prelude to the incredible Lord of the Rings saga and the Silmarillion. Another good series is George R.R. Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire""."
5,The Extremely Necessary Intro to the Lord of the Rings,"This is the book that changed my mind about books. In high school we had to choose a book to report on, and a friend said The Hobbit was kind of interesting, so that's the one I chose.To say I was happy with my choice would be a gross understatement. From the first page my imagination seemed to mesh perfectly with Tolkien's world, and without the ""speed of absorption"" imposed by a movie, I was wonderfully soaking up all the detail that Tolkien includes in all his works. I was there.I could go on and on, but this is fantasy at its best. And, I feel, that reading it better readies you for the presently popular Lord of the Rings -- it makes the movies all the more clearer, richer, deeper.An excellent fantasy classic."
5,Perfect compatibility,"Checked with Sears and they could no longer help. I had one remote that I had to hold just right to get it to work.I ordered two of these remotes. The compatibility match is perfect. These are exactly as described. It took me longer to get the ladder out, to reach the green button on the back of the garage door opener unit, then it did to set the frequency on the two I ordered. Took approximately 15 or 20 seconds to set the frequency on both remotes. Extremely easy. Perfect match, perfect replacement. Wish I had ordered sooner."
1,Israeli bootleg. Don't bother with this one unless you like blurry kung fu.,"While the movie itself is okay. This DVD is a RIPOFF!! It looks like a grainy youtube video. It's Blurry... pixelated... mono sound. This DVD also states on the box ""more Israeli films available at [...]"". Just a heads up as to where your money is really going if you buy this. Save your money and wait for an official release."
2,too small for 6th grade,"While jansport makes an excellent backpack, this particular one was too narrow to fit the massive amount of books that my son brings home. Had to look elsewhere for the larger Jansport backpack , unfortunately, Amazon had it for alot more, which is normally not the case."
4,Three Nights in August,This was an amazing look into the inner workings of the mind of Tony Larusa and a MLB team. I would recommend this to any baseball fan.
4,Nuances of the Game,"I like for the fact they get into the nuances of the managing the game. I've coached previously and enjoy understanding this aspect. Oh, I'm a Cardinals fan."
4,Great Look Behind the Scenes!,"This book is a great chance to see what goes on in the many hours between baseball games and the life of an athlete on the road. Stories of Rick Ankiel and J.D. Drew are great examples of the perils of the modern athlete, while the part about Daryl Kile will tear out your heart! Reading about the seeming indifference of a gifted athlete like Jose Canseco can make one question why they believe in baseball, but then there's the story of Albert Pujols to restore one's faith. By the way, Bissinger mentions about Canseco's apathy about playing during the 1990 season without following up with the Oakland A's getting swept by the mighty underdog Red in the Series that year. My big question after reading the book is, ""How does Tony LaRussa continue to function while getting so little sleep?"""
3,A basic book on baseball,"A well written book that provided some insight into the game, particularly the thought process of a manager. For that I give it three stars.But '3 Nights' was neither as enlightening nor thought provoking as a 5-star sports book - such as 'The Game' by Ken Dryden, 'Beyond the Sixth Game' by Gammons, or Lewis' 'Moneyball'. At times, Bissigner's work came across more as a hero worship of La Russa than a study of the game, which detracted from the author's credibility to accurately assess what he witnessed and learned from the dugout."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the premise is intriguing and Widmark is effective, this short (80 minutes) noir is too insubstantial to be worth recommending; long on atmosphere and short on plot, it's worth a look if you're a noir-hound but there are many better options out there."
3,excellent drama on the waterfront,"Excellent old time detective thriller. You never have a doubt as to what's going to happen, but getting to go along for the ride, makes it worth all the while. Just the right bit of humour too...well worth adding to any collection."
3,review,The product came on time and has been very useful. I found the book here for a more affordable price here.
4,Must read for any women who is just TOO NICE!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It made me think of several women I know how are holding out for their jerk of a boyfriend to finally treat them right. A must read if you feel your relationship is going nowhere ... this book will help you realize that you deserve better treatment and what to do about that! I loved it!
3,My Own Thoughts,This book had some good ideas and some interesting ways to deal with a man's behavior. But mostly it was a way of teaching a woman to pride herself.I read the book in one seating so it held my attention and was a good read.I would recommend it.
1,Boring,"This book was boring and did not hold my interest. I like a friend borrow it as well and she was disappointed with it too. We were hoping for more personal insight and guidance on how to ""not care too much"" and be more stand offish."
5,Love IT,I have lent this book to so many young woman. It is well written and even though the advice sometimes sounds humorous it is so true. I RECOMMEND all woman who are dating to read this!!
3,"Don't believe the hype, the overly dominant, hyper-feminist hype.","Ladies, men don't love bitches. Don't believe the title of that book by Sherry Argov. It's not true. In fact, any man who loves an overly dominant woman (a.k.a. bitch) is a sick masochist and deserves everything that happens to him in such a relationship. I have no doubt that some men enjoy pain, but don't let stupid books like this confuse you."
3,A guy's guide at its best,"This book is good for men to read. I think every guy should buy it for the following reasons:1. There won't be any copies left for women2. The content works great on women too. As a man, simply apply the same principles towards females and get the same respect from them towards you. In other words, the book backfires, so be careful, Mrs Argov.-The one your mother warned you about."
5,amazing and acurate!,"This book was and is amazing. I've recommended it to a friend who may need it more than I do. I am so glad I have it close at hand on my phone/kindle as I keep re-reading it each time I want to respond to ""his"" email. Thank you for a fantastic book, keep them coming!"
2,Things you already know,This books repeats its self over and over and it's things we know as women I wouldn't recommend to anybody could have wrote this book I guess I bought if because of the title......
4,One thing really didn't work- I'm so bummed,"I loved the book and tried many of the suggestions that Sherry offers. I'm in the beginning stages of a new relationship- we've scheduled the first date but not yet gone on it. This man emails me five times a day and calls me a lot. I decided to casually 'disappear' for a night and not answer my phone or respond to his emails. (Sherry's suggestion). The next day I gave him a call, left him a voice mail and sure enough, he called me back within an hour- Just like the book said he would. We spoke, had a nice conversation and I HAVEN""T HEARD FROM HIM SINCE. No phone calls, no emails. WHAT""S WITH THIS?"
3,Why Men Love Bitches,"The book was in good shape when I received it. Why Men Love Bitches is suppose to be funny, but I really don't find that much humor in it. Some parts give me a smirk, but I don't really laugh."
2,Not completely accurate,"This book is directed towards a certain type of women, to advise them them on how to act towards a certain type of man. Contrary to what it suggests, not all men are alike, no more than all women are alike. This book seems to categorize all men as chauvinists, and all women (at least the target audience) as dumb blonds. Doesn't necessarily work out that way. If you are having social issues of the sort that this book alludes to, you might want to see a counselor instead of taking advice from someone who is probably (as the title suggests), a Bitch!"
2,Not recommended from this single woman,"I had a friend recommend this book, as she had heard other non-married women recommend it. I think it is pop psychology at it's worst and I like pop psych usually.If you are truly a doormat in all facets of your life, can't say no, then buy the book.If you are single, because you have focused on your career and have a limited dating pool then don't buy the book.If you like the book ""The Rules"" then again you might like it. I think dating as a grown up requires throwing out the rules, being honest and enthusiastic to meet new people. This book doesn't suggest that as a solution versus once again the single woman is told ""it is all you."" It could really be you, I don't know you ;-)The book is written in a satire format which is amusing, but I read about half of it and said enough. I do have a friend who I think maybe could use the book, but I am afraid she might take it literally. So for now it lies beside my bed and I probably won't finish reading it."
2,Manipulator,I had to adjust the score on this book because I read a lot of books. Shery Argovs themeis manipulative.It is not trully honest to have true love in your life you need to be able to be you're true self.If you need to be a bitch with the man then he is not the one for you. When a man is in love with a woman she does not need to change who she is.
3,Some Good Suggestions But a Lot of Games,"I liked some of the suggestions in this book about independance and I feel that for ""doormats"" this book can help. What I didn't like were the subtle manipulative games suggested for women that try to win a man over, and after trying some of those suggestions in this book, they did NOT work at all.I actually had a guy ask me ""did you read that B**ch Book, because if you did, it's not working.""So read it for some of the good suggestions, but don't try the tricks and manipulation, because from personal experience from what I just said above, it doesn't work at all."
4,I actually learned a lot,Definitely had my doubts about this book but curiosity got the best of me. At first I thought most of the advice was common sense but there really are some useful tactics in here with a lot of similar situations I've been in.
3,It's a reminder,"It definitely helps after a breakup... Good principles, a little too cold...It probably tampers with the dreamy idea that you can find someone who loves you as you are..."
4,What Man Admits He Likes Bitches?,"This is a fun book to read and has some good advice, once you get past the traditional definition of bitch versus her definition of bitch. I agree with acting like a prize (showing that you value yourself) and not being ""too nice"" which translates into not being desperate or needy. I totally disagree with the advice that the meal you cook for him should be popcorn. Also, while some of these things will work initially, I don't think anyone wants a long-term relationship with a true bitch. As they say, take what you want and leave the rest."
4,a new view,"OK! I was in a long term relationship and ended it because it wasn't working anymore. I was down and feeling sorry for myself when a friend said that I should read this book. I laughed when she told me the title. But I went out the next morning and bought it. I finished it in two days. It made me laugh and it opened my eyes to the guys point of view. When you buy this book (and you should) just remember that you dont want a guy to play games with you, so don't play games with them. You still have to be yourself no matter what. This book has a lot of good advise for everybody. My only advise is KEEP IT REAL, DON'T PRETEND TO BE SOMEONE YOU AREN'T!! You won't feel comfortable and you would only be hurting yourself."
5,at first i thought....,"at first i thought i don't even want to buy a book with this title. what if someone sees me reading it...but i quickly got over that after flipping through some of the pages and seeing some of the common mistakes i've made. as a black woman a lot of the advice she gives is some of the stuff i've heard from my mother (who's been married to my daddy for 30 yrs) but with so many sources (magazines, talks shows, friends, self help books, church, etc) telling you what to do to get a guy to act right it's just confusing. don't let the title fool you...this is a funny book that is dead on about how to get a guy to treat you the way you want to be treated through your own smart choices."
1,What a complete joke,"Being a man, I can tell you from personal experience that this is exactly NOT the way you should behave if you are looking for a sensitive and caring man. Do onto others as you would have them do unto you. I've dated several women who were like this and dropped them very quickly. This book is absolutely ludicrous."
4,This book changed my life,"I was the postergirl for ""doormat."" I took pride in doing everything for my man and found him more and more distant. Then I happened upon ""Why men..."" and read it all in one night. The next time I saw my boyfriend (later that week) there was a noticeable shift in attention (it was coming MY way) just because of my new attitude. The day after that date, he called so frequently I actually thought ""Pest!"" Less than a week after I read this gem of a book, he called to tell me about a bumper sticker he just saw that said ""BITCH: Babe in Total Control of Herself"". I thanked him for the report; hung up; did a happy dance.I wish Ms. Argov had sometimes been more specific in identifying ways out of the hole we've dug for ourselves. Overall, the book however is about an attitude shift and specifics aren't always necessary.I am recommending it to all my sister ""doormats"" out there who are bone tired of trying to find the answer to relationship magic. It is right here!"
4,You've got to buy this book !!!,"This is the BEST book on relationships I've ever read. I wish it was written 30 years ago. I made most of the mistakes Sherry writes about. If this book was around I could have saved myself a lot of heartache. I flipped through one of my co-worker's copies and went right home and ordered both her books. I read it over a rainy weekend, and couldn't put the book down. Buy a copy for yourself, your best friend and your Daughter."
1,Insane and senseless,"If you are a woman and wants to learn about self esteem, I suggest you start doing yoga, learn about yourself, your strenghts and weaknesses, your dreams and what makes you fulfilled besides a man. In no way, I mean IN NO WAY, read this book if you are looking for love, that is, real relationships with real people in the real world."
1,"Same old, same old","When I first started reading this book I laughed a lot, it was very funny and clever but suddenly it fell into this ""change your personality"" type of theme and from there everything went downhill. Basically, guys will like you but, you will no longer be ""you"" but this complex creature who will have predetermined reactions for every situation. Half way through the book, the author has gotten her point across millions of time, she contradicts herself in every chapter, telling you not to be his servant, nevertheless you should never complain for his mess in the house, letting him do whatever he wants, etc. She repeats herself trying to write a book out of a single thought. I would not recommend this book to anybody, it is merely a waste of time in something that can be said in one page."
1,Rather Misandristic,"A rather misandristic selection of ""solutions"" and surveys, masquerading as a self-help guide for women."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A whole bunch of X-Men nostalgia. Or, how many people in the one house can have the hots for Jean Grey.Not to mention Magneto - the birth of a really good villain, and the amusing villainy of Unus the Untouchable, the Vanisher, and various other clowns of that nature.Fun."
2,"Travel &#65533; Good, Other stuff - ???",I thought the Travel parts of this book were extremely entertaining to read. I was enjoying it up until Crichton got into the stuff about entities attached to his body and his obsession with cosmic stuff. Also the severe lack of Dinosaurs has been noted.
1,A hodge-podge of personal trivia,"I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school, a few good travel essays, a lot of paranormal stuff - energy balancing, auras, channeling, etc. etc. I see a lot of readers loved it, but I thought it was a waste of time."
5,Beautiful Insight into Michael Crichton,"I am a fairly new reader of Crichton books. I had always thought of him as ""science fiction"", but anyone reading his books will know he puts so much non-fiction into his fiction....a person just cannot stop reading his book, once started. Upon reading this book, ""Travels"" it really allows you to know the inner ""Michael Crichton"". He holds nothing back. Tells things that most people only ""think"". As always with his books, it is a book you will not put down until it is read completely. I laughed and at times cried. At times I felt as though I were reading his private diary. What a great book for anyone and everyone."
4,Unexpected and worth reading,"The book is a series of episodes from Crichton's life. The various short episodes include, experiences as an medical student, visiting psychics in England, travelling in remote villages in Asia, climbing Mount Kilminajaro, working with Sean Connery on THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, and new age explorations. But the episodes all tie together to make a point. The most surprising thing in the book is that Crichton makes a very strong case for ""psychic phenomena"". From his work and education, I'd always assumed he would be a hard-science materialist, but he is not. He makes an interesting case for his viewpoint, and I'm sure he's sincere (he has little to gain from making such claims). But I can't say he convinced me. Even so, I've reread the book once, and will probably do so again. Very interesting and well-written."
4,An interesting set of stories,"Have you ever wondered how Michael Crichton came up with such diverse stories as ""Jurassic Park"", ""Sphere"", ""The Andromeda Strain"" and ""Congo""? Maybe because he draws on real life experiences...as his curiosity urges him to find out first hand. I mean, what better way to do research for his novels?I have read many of Micheal Crichton's books in the past and found this one to be just as enjoyable as any of his fictional stories. I highly recommend this book as it gives you an insight into how he chose the subjects for many of his stories. I guess that's why you always feel a certain amount of realism when reading his work.Follow his journeys which range from the spiritual to the dangerous, his experiences as a doctor and feeling embarrassed to use his own name when he sold his first few short stories."
4,Great Serial Killer Tale,"I've been a fan of Bentley since reading his first novel, and this story has done nothing to change that. I much prefer his ""icky bug"" stories (horror), but this one is pretty good.There are glaring references that date to the decade when he wrote the story, but they did not take away from a great and interesting tale.My biggest problem is that the red herring goes unresolved. I won't say what it is, but he dangles it in front of us almost from the start and in the end, leaves us hanging. A minor quibble, it would have been nice to see it played out better.Mr. Little is one great writer and I can't wait for his next icky bug.Highly recommended."
2,Missed Opportunity,"There was a lot of opportunity by the authors of this book- Nicky Cruz and his partner- to reach out and touch some of the thousands of troubled gang members in this country. Indeed, the chance was there for Cruz to show these lost kids what God's love is truly all about and how they can find salvation through acceptance. But instead, Cruz- apparently under the influence of Pentecostal Brainwashing- goes in a tirade of nonsense such as speaking in tongues (purely theater) and a host of holier than thou condemnation tactics- and in the process loses many kids that would have otherwise been found. I don't fault Cruz for his ministries, he is trying in his own way- but if he would leave the snake handling alone, he would reach a lot more lost souls."
3,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed with the content and wrap-up. With the time it took to write and research, it seems that Jeal Auel was quick to add content that took away from not only this book, but the entire collection. Maybe to add pages or get more readers - I was really put off by the, lets say, pornographic genre scenes scattered within the pages of what could have been a great follow-up to the Plains of Passage."
1,Wow!,"I enjoyed her previous books. This one is, if not the most, at least a serious contender for, the most boring book I have ever read. Thank God I'm finished with it. What preserverance to complete it at all!."
1,Worthless....Sank Faster Than The Titanic,"The only good thing I can say about this book is that I didn't have to buy it. It was a birthday gift from my sister. What a way to celebrate your 60th birthday. I eagerly awaited the 5th installment in the saga of Alya and Jondalar. Jean, you have insulted all of your devoted fans. Give us credit for having read the previous books and stop repeating yourself over and over and over again. Enough already. If you can't do any better than this, forget the 6th book. Sorry Sis, I wish I could get your money back."
2,The Shelters of Stone,"The book was good, however I found that it repeated the history of all prior issues to a point of boredom at times. The book was full of typographical errors on the Kindle version. If it was worth reading again, I would read the paper version in hopes of avoiding a multitude of typos."
1,snore.........,I painfully read the entire book just to see if something exciting would happen up to the very end of the book. It didn't.
2,Typos Typos Typos,"The typographical errors in all the books of this series, have made this otherwise wonderful book, extremely difficult to read. Not only are there occasional errors, there are repeated errors, in the character's names. I was very disappointed in the quality of the ebook."
2,Where was the story?????,Really a reminder and a rehash of her books. Did not have a story line. Really disappointed.
4,Not the best..not the worst,"I was so excited when this book came out. 11 1/2 years was so long to wait. I thought that there were many interesting parts to the book, but that overall, the book lacked the excitement of some of the earlier ones. However, I must say that I am looking forward to the next book, given that Ayla's life has taken an amazing turn and has a promise of greatness and drama."
3,The shelters of stones,After waiting so long this book in the series was slightly dissapointing mainly because of the referance so frequently to the previous books.It also felt that nothing important really happens and that the action will start in the next book.However it was readable and a must if you have read the rest in the series.
5,Ignore the naysayers!,"Good grief. What a bunch of hogwash these reviews are. If you love this series, you're going to love this book. Period. I couldn't wait to turn every page, and hated to see it end. It was actually a relief to me not having all the drama in this book. I am waiting patiently for the next installment."
4,They are getting better,I found this last book the best. Less focused on the sex life of the characters and more about character development. It was good alone and it interested me in the next. My mail critique was that several time she (the author) got lost in details of the setting in the midst of a dramatic point between the characters. I do appreciate its length.
2,Disappointing end to some great stories.,I could have saved my money and a lot of time if I had know it was just a rehash of all of her books.
5,"I hope Ayla is alive and welll, still. I've enjoyed her growing up, becoming independent, and finally married and expecting.","I've loved all Jean Auel's books with Ayla, Whinney,Racer, Wolf and Jondalar (in that order.) Now she is pregnant with her second baby."
3,Lots of typos!,"A great novel, but such a shame that the Kindle version is full of typos and mistakes, to pay any money for a novel that hasn't been proofed is very poor."
2,Waited too long for too little,"I'd eagerly awaited this ""new"" book in the series, however, I could have saved my money, and re-read what I already have in my collection. I really expected more than a rehash of events, we don't need to spend an entire tome reliving the same old prejudices Ayla had gone through before. I had anticipated a final chapter, with Ayla meeting Durc and her Clan at some point, and living up to a dream she had about Durc and a new child she had meeting on perhaps dangerous ground. Or maybe I just dreamt this plot. At any rate, since MS Auel is writing another book, I sincerely hope she can get down to a continuation of the story and not simply a rehash of prior books with one new event!!"
1,Good Material for Starting a Fire with a Firestone,"Got this book as a Christmas gift at my request because I, like a great many other people, waited a long, long, long time for the fifth book to appear. How do I tell my son what a horrendous waste of his money this book was! I have read the other reviews so I won't go into great detail. The one-star reviews said it all for me. Don't want to risk being as REPETITIVE as the author. However, quoting P.T. Barnum, ""There's a sucker born every minute"". How true...I'm one of them. Terrible book. If you feel you must read it, get it at the library."
4,"Shelters of Stone, The Earth's Children)","I ordered the audio tapes and enjoyed them tremendously! I have always been curious about how Ayla would be accepted when they got to Jandalar's home, now I know. I look forward to the next book in the series."
1,the shelter of the stones,"i have e-mailed your company twice now about my book missing pages. would really like to know if i am going to get one in return with all the pages in it or what. when someone pays for something, they expect it all to be there. Althea Chapman"
2,Boring,"I too had been anxiously awaiting the next in the series of ""Earth's Children"". Reviewing earlier plots was fine with me because I had forgotten a lot since the last book. But the book was basically boring. I was anxious for it to end. The worst segment was the complete details about the burial of the man who was crushed by a bison. It just went on and on and on. I wouldn't want to know that much about the burial of any person. And she kept repeating that poem about mother earth. I kept waiting for some conflict with the persons that didn't like Ayla but it never happened. The characters just sounded too modern for the era it represented."
3,Prefer More Engaging Plot and Characters,"The Shelters of Stone could have been so much better. I looked forward with great anticipation to this book and getting reacquainted with the characters, but have to admit I was disappointed. I found myself skipping entire sections to get to the action, and learned little new about Ayla and Jondalar. Perhaps I made the mistake of reading this after devouring a book that has been highly recommended by other readers here: Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Unlike Auel, Martin keeps the story focused squarely on the characters and their unfolding drama, which results in a page-turning plot that moves quickly toward a powerful, memorable ending. Incredible. Rather than resort to steamy sex scenes, Martin uses subtle interactions between well-developed characters to heighten the ""connection"" on a deep level, and you never leave this story. I hope that Auel will use a similar style in the next novel to draw me back into her drama."
1,Stretched too thin,"I enjoyed the saga up to the Valley of the Horses, and was a little disppointed by The Plains of Passage. But this last book is nothing but a tedious account of the day-to-day life of some stone age tribe. It is slow, repetitive and boring. In fact it is about the only book I haven't finished in the last ten years.Just a book about the properties of plants."
2,I waited 6 years for this!!??,"I would like to begin by saying I have read and thoroughly enjoyed the entire ""Clan"" series. That was up until ""Shelters of Stone"". I was almost entirely let down by this book due to the fact that I waited almost 6 years to read the next saga in Ayla's life. The book seemed to lacked the heart and soul of the other books, especially ""Valley of Horses"". I felt like she almost didn't know what to write about and all the characters and description, including Jondalar,Wolf, the horses, and even the food that had been such a big part of the previous 3 books, were forgotten about and she was trying to build and/or change Ayla into almost another character. I did enjoy the ending and I was starting to get into it. Maybe the next book will be better; here's to hoping for the next 6 years!!"
1,Highly Disappointing!,"The first 4 books in Jean Auel's series captured my interest and attention totally (they were originally recommended to me by my daughter), and I looked forward to this latest volume. As I have, for some years, been in the habit of writing thumbnail reviews of all books I read into my 'Booklover's Journal,' I thought I might share my entry for THE SHELTERS OF STONE with anyone who might care to read it:Following Auel's earlier works, this diatribe was a HUGE disappointment. The novel reads as if the author had been paid by the word. It is BORING, to say the least.Auel uses totally unrealistic dialogue with her characters...and often useless repetition! It is a highly unsatisfying read, and words shouldn't even be wasted on criticizing it. It is truly a waste of time (at 753 pages). Which is probably why I started 'skimming' at Page 200.I doubt, Ms Auel will have me buying the next instalment..."
1,Major disappointment,"Loved her earlier books and eagerly bought this one. By the time I plodded half way through I had a mental picture of someone learning to cut and paste. The endless repetition of the introductions, and the word Zelandoni, became most annoying. After 700 and some pages you realize the story could have been told in a couple of chapters. Wish I'd just borrowed it from the library. I respect her extensive research but it might have been better appreciated in a non fiction form, as we were hoping for more of a story. More editing next time might help."
2,"Waited too long, and not worth while","I hurried through the 4th book, to recall the story, since the last time I had read it was a couple of years ago. It wasn't necessary. Auel goes over what happened in the previous books SO MANY TIMES, it barely is necessary to have read them. And for those who want to know what comes next, this book seems to add nothing to the story. We know that Ayla will have to retell what happened to her many times, but it bored me to read it all over again and so many times. There is too much detail to things that happened in the other books, and no detail to what is happening now. And a lot goes unexplained, like why Laramar's son was injured, why was he in a fight. There is no depth to the the present story, too much ""remembering"" what happened to Ayla and Jondalar before. I really want to read the next book, since this one went knowwhere, but I hope there is more story to it."
3,Cut and paste?,"I am typically more understanding and sympathetic towards authors and new books; however, I must say that this book was a disappointment. I felt as if I was reading the same chapter over and over. I even checked once to make sure I was on the right page, but Auel was just describing the Mother's Song once again. There are many very interesting, well-written, and well-researched parts of the book, but it is mostly a review of the past books and LONG descriptions of the same thing. Everyone knows how to cut and paste paragraphs, including Auel."
1,Paid By The Word,"We listened to the unabridged audio of this sinker. If you think reading those love scenes were laughable trying hearing them. Also, the poem and formal greetings were unfreakinbelievable! I am amazed that anyone would rate this book anything but B and that's B for BORING and BAD NEWS."
1,Hugely disappointing!,"One star is half a star too many. We waited over ten years for this book and paid full price for the hardcover as soon as it came out. What is up with that looong boring song being printed over and over in it? The book could have been half as long without that. And as far as the story, the previous books hint that Ayla's child is going to be a boy and that there will be some sort of confrontation between her two sons. No chance of that happening judging by the ending..."
2,"...pass the prehistoric hootch, please!","Dreary book that advances the story very little. The settlement Ayla ends up in reminds me very much of some sort of prehistoric country club where mate-swapping looms on the horizon and everybody drinks alcoholic barma during dawn-of-man cocktail hour. The story of the taming of Wolf and Whinney is told repeatedly and the recitation of the ""Mothers Song"" seems to appear every few pages and makes one yearn for a male deity to show up. Save your money and get it from the library."
1,Complete shame..,"After waiting so long for the next installment it is sad that this is the best we get. I am so disappointed. I kept reading the book waiting for something, anything, to happen. The story never got off the ground, the charactors were flat and at no time inspired my imagination as the previous books had done."
1,"Say it ain't so, Jean","As a fan excitedly anticipating this book, I couldn't wait to preorder and open it the day it arrived from Amazon. After reading one third of the story, I was ready to give up and use this 700-pager as a doorstop. Reading these reviews has actually been much more entertaining than the book itself. Ayla is so perfect and so Nancy Drew-nice, I want to smack her. I wish Jondalar would get bored himself and have an affair with a bad girl. And please, Jean, no description of minute-by-minute walking around and looking at scenery or conversational minutiae - it's BORING!! Your other books have been wonderful. Please get back the the exciting adventure and your readers will applaud."
3,Dissapointing?...not sure,"When I think of what the fifth book COULD have been like, yes this book was dissapointing. I feel let down, because I thought there was a fantastical element to Ayla's Saga. Throughout the series I felt, Auel was hinting at greater things to come for our heroine. But then again, I don't think we can expect ""The Clan Of The Cave Bear"" in this, or in any of the other books really. I think Auel is pulled between the ""scientific and realism"" (the repeating of landscape, herbal remedies etc.) and the ""melodramtic and fantasy"" of this series. I was hoping for more of the ""fantastic and dramatised"" element in this book but it wasn't to be. And when I think, perhaps Auel is really trying to depict, a closer telling of what life would have been like in the IceAge, I guess this book, is not so bad."
3,Glad I'm not the only one disappointed,"My first thought on completing this book was, ""I waited years...for THIS?"" It was almost as if Auel calculated to write ANYTHING AT ALL to keep this series going without actually completing a single storyline. I continued reading in hopes the next chapter would offer the plot continuity I'd come to expect from Auel and-gosh darn it!- at least a few of the answers/resolutions I'd waited on for a decade. Ha!I'll still have the almost-sick compulsion to read the next (final?) installment. Maybe it will contain the delicious meat of her prior books.When and if it's all finally said and done, this will be the book in the series to tell your friends to skip."
2,The Muse is Gone,Now we know why it took Jean 12 years to finish this book. Her muse is gone and with it everything that made the earlier books compelling and interesting. We can only hope she'll find it again for the final book.
1,A cure for insomnia,"This book is a real snooze. I plan to keep it near my nightstand for the next 12 years - just in case I have trouble dozing off. I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and really enjoyed the next 3 books, but this book is nothing more than a 700 page description of the way the continent of Europe looked 30,000 years ago. BORING stuff. As for the brilliant Ayla, she is relegated to a pathetic shell of her former self. I agree with all the other reviewers about the boring sex scenes, rehash of the Clan ways, etc. etc. That hunt on the 2nd day (page 250 thru 280 or so) was very contrived. They were so greedy they had to have 2 hunts? This was done more to show off Ayla's skill and Jondular's spear than to entertain the reader. It seems that way too much in this book is just 'filler'. I will not run out and buy the sixth book Ms. Auel. When I hear it's been published, I'll re-read Clan of the Cave Bear."
3,Disappointment,"I waited so long for this book, as did everyone, and was totally disappointed. I won't go into a long comment, but the book was very WORDY!!! Nothing new happened. She repeated a lot of what was in the last book."
2,*sigh* I guess it couldn't last forever,"No one is a bigger fan of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" than I am - I've read it cover-to-cover at least 10 times since 1996. And the same goes for the others in the series (especially ""The Mammoth Hunters"") which were all really great. I will not be rereading ""Shelters,"" I'm sorry to say. I got the impression that the whole story, inflated to over 700 pages, could have easily fit in the first 100 pages of the next book. All the conflict built up to in the last few books - especially the very big question of the Zelandonii's acceptance of Ayla and her Clan background and son - were dismissed entirely. Oops, I guess Jondalar didn't have reason to be worried after all. Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people's reaction. There's no story here - just constant introduction and repetition. Read it only if you plan to read the 6th, so you won't be lost in a maze of characters."
1,"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive","I waited twelve years for this? I have loved Ms. Auel's other books, but this one is a great disappointment.It reminded me of a child that had to do a 1,000 word essay and could only find 200 words for the essay. I found myself skipping several pages at a time because I was tired of reading the same thing repeatedly. It seems as if Ms. Auel has forgotten how to fill out the people in her books and make them seem real as she has in past books. With her previous books I could not put them down until I had finished them, not even to sleep, but with this book I found myself forcing myself just to read a few pages at a time, I just kept thinking it has to get better, but it didn't. I can only hope that she recaptures her old style and that book six is much better than book five."
2,Big Let-down,"After waiting all these years to finally finish the story of Ayla and Jondalar, I am severely disappointed in the fifth book in the Earth's Children series. I loved the first four books but found myself actually skipping pages in this one. I was skipping pages not because I was so excited, but because I was trying to find something to keep me interested. That dreadful song/psalm/poem nearly killed me. I do hope that Ms. Auel will not feel she has to retell the major points of her previous five books when she writes the sixth installment of the series. This book was too long. ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" is only 468 pages long and it is a great story. Instead of writing another epic 700+ page novel, maybe the next book will be a little less long-winded and a little quicker in coming, too. I gave the book two stars but you can see I am already anxious for the next part of the story to be told. Please, Ms. Auel, just keep it simple next time. Thank you."
2,I waited 12 years for THIS!?,"I really enjoyed the first 4 books, especially The Clan of The Cave Bear, and The Mammoth Hunters. The interpersonal relationships set in the backdrop of primordal Europe has been the backbone of the series. I grew weary of the landscape descriptions, of every river and creek and inlet having to be named and explaining why they were named that. There was so little of the people of the Ninth Cave, I expected to be let into their hearths to see their impression of Ayla and her animals, new inovations, etc. Instead the only thing we find out is that every man is envious of Jondalar and every woman is envious of Ayla. (BIG SURPRISE) The most enjoyable part is finding out that there was Trailer Trash long before there were trailers. Wait for the paperback on this one."
3,Mediocre at best,"I am a die-hard Jean Auel fan, so I felt like I had to read this book. It was really interesting reading about Jondalar's people, but the problem was there was a lot of repitition from the previous books. I felt like I had to read about it all over again: the introduction of the spear thrower, the contraception tea, the flint stone for making fire, the horses, and the wolf. And of course how PERFECT Ayla is, I swear that girl never makes a mistake, whereas Jondalar is a little more believable. There was a lot less sex in this book, than in Plains of Passage, probably because the two main characters weren't alone as much this time around. Jean Auel has definately lost her edge a bit since The Clan of the Cave Bear. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of two, was because of how much I like this book series as a whole."
1,Boring,"I was so ready to be done with this book. I absolutely loved the others in the series...lost major parts of entire days reading them non-stop, but this long awaited addition is nothing but repetitious drivel. Really, how many times does Ayla need to be formally introduced. How many caves, rivers & landscapes need to be described in such detail that the reader loses all interest. Nothing happens that I cared about at all."
1,The Shelters of Stone,"I have readed this book over and over. Where is the story? Where is the plot? Did I miss something, or was it just not there? Did Jean realy write this book? Boy I hope not, because if she did after 10 years she has lost it.On the book cover it said "" Jean Auel is at her very best in this superbly textured creation of prehistoric society."" Sorry Ms Auel but you miss it by a mile. Better luck next time.Please take your time and go back and read your first book and try to get the magic back before you write #6."
1,Major let down,"...The book is more about Auel's hypothesis of what the region looked like, and how people lived, than it is and actual story. No build up. No climax. This title is a best seller because we all expected it to live up to the last four books. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close. This is the last of the series I spend good money on."
3,Shelters of Stone,"Book is well written and kept my interest, but there was too much condensed into one book. There where areas that I wish she had written more on and other areas less. I liked books 1-4 better then this one."
2,Where's the variety?,"I'm wondering why everyone thus far has rated this book so highly. After having to wait only four years for this book, I'm sorry to say that it was rather disappointing to have to read the repetitious ""Ayla of the Zelandonii greets you..."" for the ENTIRE book. Did the summer meeting need to drag on for the entirety? Or did we really need to go through 700 pages of her demonstrating fire over and over again?Maybe I'm being critical. I, at least, have to agree with the previous reviewer. Don't bother reading this book unless you've already dedicated yourself to the series. Let's hope something happens soon with the last book."
3,Satisfying read ... until the last 1/4,"Despite the long wait for Auel's new book, the beginning of Shelters of Stone meshes perfectly with Plains of Passage and the rest of the series. Sadly, the ""voice"" slips towards the end of the book, and the last portion is just a setup for the next book.I wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't read the rest of the series, but you won't need to re-read the whole story before tackling this enormous book (maybe just look over the last chapter of Plains to remember where it ended). Auel peppers the novel with reminders of what went on in the previous books (helpful, but a little annoying if you've just read the others in a marathon session, which I had...), and (thank goodness) she included a list of names at the end - I think it's the most characters she's had yet!On the whole, fans will want to have a look at this new chapter in Ayla's life, repetition and all, but try to get it from a public library first."
3,From storyteller to school teacher,"Maybe it's just me, but I was really disappointed by this book. I've read all of the previous books, and this one seemed to be relatively boring. It seemed to drag, and too much time was spent describing the landscape, the animals, the people and the way they lived, over and over again. The story itself was good, but not fulfilling, and left a lot hanging. I realize there's probably another one in the works, hopefully it will be better written."
3,I couldn't wait for this book!,"I couldn't wait for Jean Auel's fifth book in the series and pre-ordered it. I have to admit, her fifth book in the series isn't as strong as the other four, but my interest in Ayla's and Jondalar's welfare never wanes! I cried when they are suffering. I feel joy at their triumphs. They are old friends at this point and I want to see them make it--as a couple and as leaders in their community. I only hope my success is a fraction of hers (Jean's) in the years to come as my first book, ""Forever Retro Blues"" has only come out this year. I hope Jean doesn't make us wait as long for the next adventure as she did promise this would be a six book series."
4,FINALLY HERE,SHELTERS OF STONE TAKES THE READER BACK INTO ALYAS AND JONDALARS LIVES ONCE THEY ARRIVE AT HIS HOME. ALYAS IMPRESSING PEOPLE AGAIN WITH HER MANY TALENTS. PEOPLE ARE AMAZED WITH THE ANIMALS BEING SO FRIENDLY. I FELL UNDER THE AUTHORS SPELL ONCE AGAIN THE SAME WAY AS WITH THE OTHER FOUR BOOKS. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE SIXTH AND FINAL BOOK IN THE SERIES IS OUT. I FIND WITH THESE BOOKS I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THEM BUT FEEL BAD WHEN I'M DONE KNOWING THE SERIES WILL SOON BE OVER.
1,Ayla is like a prehistoric McGyver,"This book is tiresome!!! Took real effort to read it all the way to the end. I was very much looking forward to this book which turned out to be a real snore. By the end of the first hundred pages I felt like Ayla was a prehistoric McGyver. Good grief, the needle, bow and arrow, etc., I wondering how it was she didn't invent electricity (wait, no, that was Ben Franklin). The effort to get to the end of definitely not worth it."
2,SHELTERS OF STONE,"I HAVE READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THEM SO I EAGERLY BOUGHT THE LATEST INSTALLMENT IN THE SERIES. I TRIED READING IT SEVERAL TIMES AND GOT BOGGED DOWN SO I ENDED UP GETTING THE UNABRIDGED AUDIO VERSION FROM THE LIBRARY! IN MY OPINION THE BOOK COULD HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF. THE AUTHOR REPEATS HERSELF CONSTANTLY, EXPLAINING OVER AND OVER AGAIN DETAILS OF JONDALAR AND AYLA'S JOURNEY. I FOUND THAT UNNEEDED AND VERY ANNOYING. I LIKED THE FACT THAT AYLA WAS A VERY STRONG CHARACTER AND THAT WOMEN WERE CONSIDERED AS EQUALS TO MEN IN THE BOOK AND IF YOU CUT OUT ALL THE REPETETIVE DIALOGUE AND INFORMATION IT IS A FAIRLY GOOD READ. HOWEVER, I AM NOT SURE IF I WILL BOTHER WITH THE NEXT EPISODE."
1,Disappointment after the long wait,"After waiting all this time for the Shelters of Stone to be released, I rushed out to get my copy full of anticipation of another fascinating weekend read. I ploughed through the book to the end, only to be really disappointed. Instead of a brief synopsis of the previous books, Jean refers constantly to them throughout the text. I'm assuming that anyone who buys Shelters of Stone is an avid Auel fan and will therefore have read the first four books several times.I found no new plots, story lines or snippets that we have not read in one of the other parts of the series. The constant reuse of all the title names of the members of the group became very tedious and I started skipping them !There is hardly even any build up of tension at the end to make the wait for the last book nail biting !I just hope that the final episode will be worth the wait."
3,"It wasn't bad, but I expected more","I found this book to be mediocre. I loved the introduction of the new characters, but was disappointed to find that the action, romance, and excitement I was used to from previous Earth's Children books was definitely lacking. Upon completion of the book, I just sat there thinking, ""is this it?""There were parts of the book where I skipped a few paragraphs to avoid reading the same stories that have been told countless times. The same goes for descriptions of the landscape, which I found to be verbose. Some retelling is necessary in a sequel to remind readers of past novels, but it was overdone here.Even though I was disappointed with this book, I do look forward to Jean Auel's next novel. If it is one thing this novel accomplished, it was to introduce new characters and set the stage for another book. I hope the next one lives up to my expectations."
1,O......M......G.........at least I'm not the only one,"good GRIEF! and WHEW! I thought it was just me, but this book and Plains of Passage are horrid. Even the reader for Plains of Passage on the Books on Tape version was barely tolerable. What happened to the story telling...this is fiction, not Prehistoric History of Europe 101 overandoverandoverandOVER.Some detail, good...as much detail as these books have (and it's the same in BOTH books again and again and again...we get it, you did a LOT of research), not necessary. And the animals have no personality any more.BLECH! Maybe Jean Auel burned out after Mammoth Hunters, produced a mediocre Plains of Passage and just needed a break. Well, take another before finishing off the series or don't finish at all. I won't buy another one of these."
4,Little Women book,This book brought back memories of reading and seeing movie many years ago. Enjoyed reading it on my Kindle Fire.
5,Little women,I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it.
3,Why to read this book.,It was a book about four young ladies. I would read it if you liked somewhat sad books and somewhat romantic.
4,A little disappointed,"While I still love the covers for the penguin classics series and I enjoyed ""Little Women"" as a story, after having read ""Tess of the Durbervilles"" and enjoying the incredible footnoting, I was a little disappointed with the footnotes for ""Little Women."""
5,Little Women,At the beginning all the girls were very selfish. There mother and sister Beth teaches them to feel better and content. By the end they become good women.
2,Little Women,I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to.
4,Little Women: A Big Treasure,"I read Little Women after having seen the movie. I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these ""little women"" as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school. Read this book to be transported to the world of little women."
2,Not the Best Copy of a Beautiful Story,"""Take care my skirt don't trip you up...""""Don't Meg pull fair?""""Oh, yes she tries to but she don't love Bethy as I do...""If you're looking for a copy of Little Women with lots of colorful illustrations don't buy this copy there are none.If you're looking for a copy with extra information about the author don't buy this one there's only a very short paragraph at the end about Louisa May Alcott that comes after the 15 ""book discussion"" type questions that are not very useful to an independant reader.I was not impressed with the wording of this Sterling Publishing edition of this beloved children's classic. I've read other editions of Little Women and don't remember the word don't being used so poorly throughout the novel as it was in this edition. Are these the original words of Louisa May Alcott or don't people know how to use proper English back in the 1860's?"
2,No longer relevant.,"Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."
5,THE BOOK IS GREAT,I LIKE THE BOOK BECAUSE IT TEACHES YOU A LESSON ABOUT NEVER HOLD A BABY WHEN IT HAS SCHARLET FEVER I HAVE A QUESTION HOW OLD IS AUNT MARCH IN THE PORITATS OF LITTLE WOMEN BOOKS I KNOW SHE IS OLD BUT HOW OLD IT BUGS ME AND MY FRIENDS BECAUSE WE DONT KNOW.
4,Little Women is a great book and a classic.,This book is easy to read and takes me back in history. Even if it is fiction. I would recomend this book to my friends.
4,WOW!,"This book took me awhile to read and some parts I didnt quite understand. But it is one of my favorites. I love all the characters, espcially Joe. I love the time it's in and the story its self. All I have to say is WOW!"
1,Help,"I haven't read this book & probably should. I started to in grade school and got bored after 2 pages. Anyway, I watched the movie recently and was very confused. It was a pretty good story and apparently autobiographical, but can someone who is hip on this story answer some questions. e-mail me at msbeckaru@aol.com1) Who is Marmee? The sisters are Meg, Jo, Beth, & Amy as best as I could tell. Does the mom have a name? 2) Is Teddy the same person as Laurie cuz I'm really confused on that. 3) What are Meg's babies names? They didn't say in the movie. 4) Who's the old lady who leaves Jo the poodle and the house? Is she a relative?Thanks."
5,Little Women was one of the best books I've ever read.,That was one of the best books I've ever read. Louisa May Alcott is my favorite author.You have to read the other books in the series. I LOVE LOUISA MAY ALCOTT'S BOOKS!!
1,Didn't send the penguin classic. Different cover. SO lame!,I was expecting the book in the picture but what I received was a solid blue covered version. Would not go through this seller again.
5,I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK,"SORRY, I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK. AT LEAST NOT IN THE PAST FIFTY YEARS. BUT LOVED IT WHEN I WAS A YOUNG WOMAN !"
4,Very good,A classic I feel should be read by every young girl. Little women does a wonderful job making you fall in love with all the characters. This story is amazing and I would recommend it.
2,This edition not as described! No margin notes!,"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist."
1,a little boring,i am yet to finish the book but is kind of boring to me. I am still reading it because when i start something i always want to finish it that is why i am still reading it otherwise i would have abandon it.
4,wonderful!!!,its a great classic novel that teaches many morals and values in the life of a family. it might have a long exposition which you have to patiently wait to get over with. an all age book
1,Terrible,Where did you get this edition of Little women? It was filled with grammatical errors. Reading your book really was a bizarre experience. Have one of you editors read this edition.
3,Tiny book!,Shame on me I did not read the dimensions of the book. Book is small around 6 x 4 inches. Makes it a little hard to read.
1,"An adaptation, not the original novel.","I borrowed this eBook from my local library and read 60% of the novel before realizing it was not Louisa May Alcott's original, but a children's adaptation of the novel. This was not clear from the title of the book or the reviews provided by Amazon. Other customers' reviews referenced the fact that this eBook contains only ""Part One"" of Little Women, and not the second part of the novel, now considered its sequel, ""Good Wives."" However, it should be noted that the Little Women story in this eBook is incomplete and does not contain the original text of the novel. Do not purchase this eBook if you are looking for Little Women - find an official, authentic version instead."
3,great moral story,"I remember watching the movie when I was younger, and had the movie in my head the whole time I was reading... waiting for all the climaxes of the book. I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through. A great moral story, especially when you are or have gone through those moments in your own life. There is a little of everything for every girl/woman. Not a page turner, but definately lightens the heart."
2,So so book,I had trouble keeping the girls apart and after reading for a while found myself bored. I did not finish it. But I do not read a lot.
1,A Great Book,"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, ""Marmee"" goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!)."
2,Cheaper but not cost effective,"When paper costs rose significantly, I started shopping more carefully for all my paper products. What could go wrong with standard double-window envelopes? When I started using these, I had to adjust the print location for my Quickbooks check printing because the window wasn't quite located correctly. Then I discovered that the window placement is not consistent. Despite the adjustment, some windows are not displaying the first line of the vendor name/address block. Just as bad, the adhesive on these envelopes tastes ghastly.I will go back to Columbian envelopes despite the higher cost."
4,Torch Song Triumph,"Here k d lang turns into a stylish torch singer with a cool, subdued vocal style inspired by late 50's/early 60's singers like Patsy Cline, Connie Francis and Peggy Lee. Now and then she even veers into jazzy realm as on the elegant Ms Chatelaine. This set mainly consists of intelligent ballads like Save Me, The Mind Of Love and Wash Me Clean, but her consummate artistry is best displayed on the two stand-out tracks Still Thrives This Love with its compelling hook, and Season Of Hollow Soul which reminds me of the finer moments of the band Everything But The Girl. Ingenue is excellent in its genre but probably an acquired taste for most."
4,"Even if you hate country, you'll love this","I', not a KD Lang fan. In fact I hate country. But this DVD is a total departure for her. Every song is a different style. Very sultry on some cuts. ""Constant Craving"" is the best cut and the reason I took a chance on an artist I would normally not buy."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the movie Shiloh to show to my students after reading the novel in class. Unfortunately, while the video quality of this DVD was just fine, the sound had a problem. We had to turn the TV up to maximum volume to just hear the movie. And yes, I did try other DVDs and their sound was fine so it was not the TV."
3,"Good for older children, careful with young, sensitive kids!","This movie is well done. It shows kids that animals have feelings that need to be respected. However, be careful letting young or sensitive children view it. The part where the owner is abusing Shiloh upset our 4 year old so bad he wouldn't watch the rest of the movie with us!"
2,Poor organization and editing hurt useful book,"The problem with this book is that it really seems like the author and editor didn't care about putting out a great product.There are lots of problems with this book. There are far too many typos (it's hard to edit a chess book, but come one!) and the organization is horrid. It's easy to miss crucial subvariations, and the lack of proper indexing, combined with poor organization, makes it very hard to find the game you need.Schiller's ""strategic overview"" in the beginning is a great idea, but it's executed poorly. A few examples concerning advancing the d-pawn here (rather than just scattered throughout the book) would work wonders.So why two stars? Well, because despite its numerous flaws, I find myself using this book a lot. There aren't any other good books on the Tarasch defense these days, and it's an excellent weapon for the club player. There is a lot of good information in here, it's just so hard tofind!"
1,A poorly executed book,"The problem with any book by Eric Schiller is that he seems to bite off far more than he can chew or he presents us with superficial stuff. He also seems to have zero qualms about rehashing editing hatchet jobs on books that have been previously written by other authors (see Schiller's book on Kasparov for an example). And here, as others have observed, he quite poorly executes what could have been a good idea -- a repertoire based on the Tarrasch Defense. It's all very frustrating for those of us who wish our chess books to be to be labors of love rather than hurried projects sent to the printing press before they are ready. The Tarrasch Defense deserves far better treatment than what Schiller offers us. I don't recommend this book to anyone. For a far better repertoire book based on the Tarrasch Defense, get Jacob Aagard's ""Meeting 1d4"", published in 2002."
4,100 years of H-D,"I searched for several days for this book for my boyfriend for Xmas. And it wasn't cheap. The book itself is awesome! I recommend it for any H-D enthusiast. However the carton it was shipped in was not in the best of shape, for starters. It was packaged this way...just kinda thrown in a box. I was surprised it didn't get damaged. That is until i opened the film covering the book...there is a sticky spot on the cover about the size of my fist and i really see no way of getting it off without damaging the book. I would love to have it replaced but since they are getting harder to come by, i really don't see that happening."
4,Nothing like a Harley,This book is very informative for the avid Harley lover!! This book would help you make an informative decision on which bike fits your lifestyle!! It is a great book to just pick up and flip thru the pages over and over again!!Billy Wannyn
3,I can't say I enjoyed this all that much.,"I had to see La Belle et La Bete in my french class, and while the sets are remarkable and acting impeccable, the plot drags its feet endlessly. Had it been sped up a bit, this film would be a true masterpiece."
5,wow!,"I started taking Chitosan around the 13th of Nov. I wore a size 16-18 in pants. I am a 46 year old truck driver so losing weight was very difficult. I was taking two pills,20 minutes before each meal. By Christmas I was down to a 13 pants. 30 days I lost 4 pants sizes! I didn't change what I ate and I didn't exercise any more than usual. I did how ever have to go buy new pants... lol. Now I only take it once a day every other day to maintain my size. I hope it does the same for you."
2,Very loud!,"This pump works but it's pretty loud. It comes with a second layer of rubber bushings and a second spacer plate but that doesn't do it any good. It's just too loud for my quiet living room. I'd rather hear my overflow than that loud buzzing sound from the pump. Get the Rio+ line, they are quiet."
4,Great product,"Not what I expected, made my stomach a little more upset their normal chealated magnesium, which is why I only gave it four stars instead of 5. I had the longer pills and they were actually preferred because like i stated I did not have issues with my stomach."
5,Unique.,"I first heard this album in 1978. I went out, bought the vinyl LP, and, over the course of the next three years, wore it to a frazzle. Thankfully, I had taped it right after I got it. When it came out on CD, I snapped it up immediately.This is the CD I take with me to audition speakers. San Lorenzo and Phase Dance have kept me from making a few mistakes as far as speakers go.I've listened to many of Pat's other albums...While most are quite good, nothing-repeat, nothing-will top this album as far as it being Pat Metheny's best effort. This CD will always be on my D.I.D. list."
4,Karaoke XTC?,"I give this only four stars because without the words it is slightly less than perfect. Although not really intended for karaoke, this disc certainly would be good for it. One can't help but sing along where the words should be. Mind you, these are the original instrumental tracks... nothing has been re-recorded.I find this to be an interesting novelty best suited for background music. Honestly, if you are an XTC fan and, like me, believe Apple Venus to be their best work, then you are going to first turn to that original CD for your listening pleasure."
3,Good. But Tomato Red is 100 times better!,"If you like Rene Shade, you'll love Sammy Barlach. I read Tomato Red first and though I liked MFTW, it seemed like an exercise that Woodrell did in order to find that perfect narrative voice for TR. I tell people that TR is the first book I'd grab off my shelf if the house was on fire. No exaggeration. Buy it now. Woodrell is also one of those rare writers that when you meet him in person you still feel as much admiration/liking for the human being as you did for the prose."
4,Vintage Baywatch,"Great Stuff. Two feature length baywatch movies from the early 90s. Nightmare Bay is Billed as the Feature lengh episode that started the show. But that is incorrect, as the pilot episode is Panic at malibu pier. And Nightmare bay is an episode from the second season. watch out for a hilarious Hasselhoff sequence at the start of River of no Return in which he strips his clothes off on the beach to music in front of gilrs playing volley ball. If you like baywatch, You must Own This."
3,DC-51 replacement demineralization cartridge,"Our humidifier requires a cartridge like this. Unfortunately you can't find it in stores so have to rely on ording on line. That being the case I ordered 2. One came in perfect shape & is working like a charm. The 2nd one not so good: some of the material inside the cartridge (carbon?) has leaked out & there are itsy bitsy little black balls the size of a pencil tip all over the place. Unfortunatly you won't find this out until you have already opened the product. Clearly the manufacturor has a quality control issue. So if you plan to buy this product, my advice...buy 2...that way you'll get at least one that isn't leaking material all over the place."
4,OK product at a descent price,Not the best bars on the market but for the price I guess you can't beat it. Easy to install with only 2 tools. 2008 Silverado ext.cab. Reuse factory bolts instead of those supplied.
5,Unintentionally hysterical,"Kurt Thomas as a gymnast turned lethal martial artist? Only in Hollywood! The idea only works if every time Thomas gets into a fight there just happens to be a piece of gymnastic equipment nearby (parallel bars, pommel horse, etc.) and of course the bad guys attack one at a time, but I guess that's just a martial arts movie tradition. The acting is brutal, the plot could've been thought up by a ten year-old, and there's a village of insane killers. Put it all together and it all adds up to a hilarious movie."
1,A must watch.,"I'm very proud of this movie as Kurt Thomas comes from my home state. This movie has it all, karate, bloodsport, a gymnast, crazy balkans people, an old guy that waves a sword and of course guys wearing black hoods holding flags. Kurt's wooden acting is astoundingly bad. Perhaps they should have hired Bart Conner too. Imagine 2 tiny gymnasts kicking ninja butt! The utter convenience of a pommel horse showing up in the middle of a town just when you need to beat up people while doing a gymnastics routine is classic.Rent this movie! Kurt Thomas needs the money!"
1,"OH, IT DESERVES MINUS 3 STARS!","ROBERT CLOUSE: THE SAME MAN WHO MADE THE GREATEST MARTIAL ARTS FILMS EVER MADE, ""ENTER THE DRAGON"" DIRECTS 1 OF THE WORST MARTIAL ARTS FILMS EVER MADE, ""GYMKATA"". KURT THOMAS. CAN'T ACT, CAN'T FIGHT, 'NUFF SAID."
2,read VICSARJOO's review - more entertaining than the film,"I could hardly believe this film was being high-listed for possible DVD release during the Amazon.com voting... let's be honest, it is not that good a movie (neither acting nor plot nor cinematography), unless you have an intense need to see some gymnastics and Kurt Thomas. But do make a point of reading VICSARJOO's review, for a delicious satire of over-blown and mis-guided reviews. If you enjoy that review (one of my favorites) there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews, though some seem a little half-hearted compared to this review by him. Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit. Thank you VICSARJOO for making me smile."
2,please check out the original!!,"Cukor's film is a remake of a very fine UK original starring Anton Walbrook and directed in 1940 by Thorold Dickinson. The American release title was Angel Street. When MGM purchased the movie it was supposed that all negatives and prints were destroyed. Happily a print was rediscovered in the studio vaults. You can decide for yourself which version you prefer. There are some terrific performances in the British film, and brilliant directorial flourishes. Walbrook's particularly good as the cold-blooded husband pushing his frail wife (Diana Winyard) over the edge. Great atmosphere, wonderful supporting cast Enjoy!"
3,Good but not in the same class as 1939,This is a fine movie - don't get me wrong. But the 1939 British film with Diana Wynyarde and Anton Walbrook in the leading roles is an absolute classic. The performances are superb. How long are we going to have to wait before we can get this version on DVD?
5,Gaslight,"A phychological film explaining the term ""gaslight"". Good for codependent, obsessive compulsive, and manipulative people. Also good for recovering alcoholics in counseling, and ai-anon members."
5,A hitchockian nightmare !,"Charles Boyer made the peak work of his career , performing the role of a handsome gentleman who marries with Ingrid Bergman with the intention of empowering her around her doe .The claustrophobic atmosphere and the spelling script make of this film a genuine gem and the masterpiece of George Cukor far beyond to me , A star is born .Two Academy Awards for this move : Best Actress and B&W; Decoration .This is the debut on screen of Angela Landsbury."
3,Sequels arent that good (at least this time),"Well, The Sign of 7 was a promising beginning for Mark Frost, but the sequel has much more troubles arriving at the same quality and finally it fails. Even though the story is well done, and its a pleasure to rediscover the heroes of the first book, Frost is unable in this book to recreate the same atmosphere of his first novel.Its a nice read for example as a holiday book, but it wont impress you as much as ""The List of 7""."
3,Nice....,"This is a story about a poor boy in South Africa (so be mindful of South African terms such as ""zebra crossing"" where Americans would say ""crosswalk"") who helps out his grandmother and as a special treat gets a new pair of sneakers. His FIRST new pair of sneakers, as he usually wears his older sibling's falling-apart handmedowns.The family relationships are sweet and clear, the story is vividly told, the resolution is simple... and yet, I just can't get into this book when I read it to my nieces. This, in turn, affects their appreciation of it as they can see that I'm just going through the motions instead of enjoying it. Try Jamela's Birthday or Those Shoes instead."
5,Lee Ann Womack - Best Female Country Singer!,"Lee Ann never fails to disappoint her fans. She, by far, outshines Shania, Faith and Trisha. Her voice is extraordinary, and her taste in music is pleasing to those who love REAL country music."
4,"It May be ""Countrypolitian"" But it's Good!","Like the Amazon reviewer said, it is maybe slicker than ""hardcore"" country, but I disagree with those who say it's not a country CD. Lee Ann has too much twang in her voice to ever sound too pop, and the intelligent song selection here perfectly matches her pristine vocals. Most of the songs are mid-tempo or ballads and many of them are not immediately catchy in an annoying way; you need to listen a few times until they sink in, which is fine with me. Rodney Crowell's ""Ashes by Now"" is one exception. It rocks."
5,I Hope You Dance with Lee Ann Womack,"If you don't have this CD get it. This CD is a must have, if you don't like country you'll love this!!!!"
4,Nice product,"Some internal pockets are too deep, but overall very nice and can fit 2 laptops with the associated cables in it."
4,I'd buy it immediately IF,they trim/slim considerably that brick the R&D Yamaha people call a power supply!What were they thinking?
1,Hopkins 46365 will not work on 2006 Mercedes E320 CDI,"I ordered the Hopkins 46365 unit since it was recommended along with the hitch I purchased for my vehicle. Upon installation, the LED trailer lights worked but were very dim. The measured voltage was only 3.4 volts at the lights. I returned the unit and ordered a Curt Model 56146. (Thank you Amazon!) The Curt unit works flawlessly with bright lights with the identical installation. The Mercedes has an advanced lighting system and only the Curt Model 56146 worked on my car."
4,Muy bueno,"Este es el primer libro que leo de Isabel Allende y me encanto. Me gusta mucho su forma de narrar, te lleva del presente al pasado y del pasado al futuro dentro de la historia de manera inperceptible. Impredecible e interesante manera de narrar."
2,mediocre,"Nunca me ha entusiasmado el estilo de Allende pero leí Los cuentos de Eva Luna y me pareció que poseían cierta calidad literaria mientras que Hija de la Fortuna es una novela totalmente predecible, simple, sin profundidad y con muchos cabos sueltos. Al leerla pensé que estaba leyendo el guión de una telenovela. No la recomiendo en absoluto (sólo si se ven atrapados por retraso en un aeropuerto y aún tengo mis dudas...)."
3,Isabel Allende,"Isabel Allende is just a bad copy of Garcia Marquez, nothing else is need to say.Isabel Allende es solo una mala copia de Garcia Marquez, no se necesita decir nada mas."
1,After Six Months It is Completely Frozen,"Be very careful of this unit. After six months of pretty good use -- it simply froze with a ""Fatal Alert Error"", a hunk of junk. I can't do a soft or hard reset. I have followed all of Sony's included CD instructions. In fact, Sony's literature does NOT even mention ""Fatal Alerts."" My screen just flashes ""Palm Powered"" over and over. I have no idea what to do. I am giving up. Also, I had early problems with the date book synching, but I fixed those. (I still don't know how I did that.) Now it appears I cannot fix this thing. Money down the drain. I am not sure if it is a Sony problem or a Palm software problem. Either way, I will not buy a Sony or a Palm unit again."
4,Miss WLC,"Good Toy! Does everything and some more! It's cute, too - I like that. My co-workers get jealous when I pull it out in meetings to take notes and check my schedule. My friends get jealous when I pull it out to play games and read the newspaper. Hahahahaha! It holds tons of information and I wish I had one years ago!"
1,this items stinks,sent it back as soon as I received it; avoid whenever possible; picture misrepresents product; misleading and deceptive advertising; should be removed from website; suspect positive reviews are plants from the company;
1,frustrated,"I received the SandMaster footbag today. I couldn't believe it when I opened the box...there was only ONE. Okay, so I should have gone to the descriptions section to look at the weight of the package so I would have known there was only ONE for the price, which was $12.65. My sons are getting into playing with the footbags of their friends and requested some for Christmas. I saw the picture of 12 and thought that was what I was getting. Now, I'm just frustrated. One footbag is not enough and I'm going to have way to much invested in them. Wish it would have stated with the picture that you were only going to get one and at their selection. Can't comment on the quality since I know nothing about them...just know that is a lot of money for a bag of sand."
2,Too much information!!,"This book is way too big! Other books do a much better job of highlighting exam material. This book does not get going until the last 200 pages, then rushes through. This book is great if you want to take your sweet time and learn Exchange Server inside out-not for exam prep"
4,"Nice, VERY nice.","Well, if you are going to study for Exchange, buckle down. You are going to have to buy a HUGE book and read it from cover to cover. Twice, probably. I suggest you buy this book--it covers everything, has great study questions and software, is somewhat easy to read--AND it gets you through the test. Exchange is listed as the SECOND MOST DIFFICULT Microsoft exam--and this book got me through it the first time with flying colors."
3,A most unimpressive book of contradictions and repetition.,"I have read one other Sybex-Network Press MCSE study guide which was for NT Workstation 4.0 and I feel the same way about Exchange Server 5.5 that I do for that one. The book is very contradictive. The reading feels like a different person contributed their own ideas of Exchange 5.5 Server to a separate chapter. One chapter has facts that are contradicted in the next one. Also, the chapters are very repetitious. Some of the chapters are like a synopsis of the previous chapter. I have taken five Microsoft Certification Tests already and I know that the questions at the end of each of these chapters do not even closely resemble any question asked in the actual real-life tests. I am very unimpressed with this book and if the Exam Cram were out already when I was looking for a book I would have bought that one!!!"
4,"you will pass the exam, but only with the transcenders help","Passed the exam two weeks ago with a 800 score. I read the book from cover to cover, and have to say is quite compreensive.The author is no mark minasi when it comes to putting the words together. but i think he knows the topic very well though.Like the other reviewers said, the it lacks a chapter on disaster recovery, which is something you come across very often when working on a day to day basis with exchange like I do.overall, well done James Chellis."
5,winds of change,Another one of Eric Burdens masters. This is an absolute must to get.As markets changed to cd's I spent years trying to find this on one on cd.Guess where aI found it just two years ago. Also see the twain shall meet.
2,Not user friendly,I bought the Yepp 700 and was somewhat dissappointed. Within minutes of owning it a piece that holds the battery broke. I also found the software and instructions to be clumsy and missing any kind of step by step instruction beyond basic operation. The unit is also somewhat bulky and has a lot of parts compared to other mp3 players.
4,Great Product,"The extra AAA battery pack seems a little flimsy, but with the carrying case they give you, you don't have to worry about it coming off. Uploading songs to it was simple and easy, great sound quality, and I like the little remote control on the headphones.Lightweight, small, and sounds good."
4,GREAT ANMIE!,"Sci-fi, anmie fans will like this one. The story, special effects, action, characters will not disappoint!! Give it a go!"
3,Peculiar enunciations!,"I have listened to Nanci for almost 30 years,heck I used to see her at The Hole in the Wall in Austin and she played for tips! My only complaint regarding her new album and the last three or four is she has developed a strange speaking and singing style. She does not have a fluid or flowing singing style;it sounds as though she is forcing words out of her mouth in an accent that borders on Irish by way of Texas. I do have to agree that the lower registers of her voice are a welcome change. Greg"
3,Eccentric,"Thin pickings from this increasingly eccentric artist. This is a ramshackle collection of songs, connected by leftover Vietnam themes that could usefully have ended on Nanci's last album. What's this obsession with the word Indochine? I haven't detected any particularly strong songs unfortunately, though 'I Love This Town' is catchy, and even though 'Love Conquers All' is more peculiar than most, I like its eccentricity. 'Big Blue Ball of War' though is an example of Nanci Griffith at her worst: there are several good ways to write songs about war, and this isn't one of them.I can't help feeling when I listen to this that Nanci is fading away. I hope she doesn't continue to knock albums out just for the sake of it."
3,"Be warned: If you use iTunes to import, get ready to type titles!","I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."
4,One High School Student's Review,"This novel is excellent. Although it starts out slow, it begins to pick up in the middle. After giving many details about the main character Pip's family, Dickens gets into a little action. For example the meeting with the convict in the churchyard. Seeing Pip grow up, I watched him go through a transformation. Once an unitellegent child, he grew up to be an intelligent young man. The book deals with child abuse, social status, and family and friendships. I saw how a sister took in her little brother to raise him and keep him from dying like the rest of their family. Love is another thing that continually comes up. When he was young, Pip fell in love with Estella and I saw how she tortured and teased him. This would be a great choice for those who love great classics."
5,Dickens' Best,"This edition of Dickens' Great Expectations is considered one of, if not THE scholarly edition now in print. It contains a cogent introduction to the novel and an exhaustive appendix. Although the price will keep many, if not all, from purchasing the book it is definetly look for from a library--looking in a university's library is probably the best bet for finding a copy."
5,Boring?,"A word I hear spoken often today is: boring. I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if ""forced"" to read a classic book like Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they read it again in 20 years after seeing the world."
5,one of the classics,"This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free. Had to have it."
5,Re-reading it.,"Loved it the first time, now re-reading it on my Kindle! It allows you to change the color of the background and size of text."
1,What A Wonderful Cure For Insomnia!,"I was forced to read this book in my English class this year, and I almost died. For a more thrilling read, try a dictionary or a phone book."
3,Tough to get through but still worth a read,It took me a very long time to finally finish the book. I even decided not to finish it at one point but I have to admit something drew me to it again after a 5 month hiatus. I was well pleased with the book by the time I finished but it could have been a lot better. I guess my expectations (no pun intended) on the book were high seeing that it was a Dickens' novel.
3,INTERESTING,"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you.... I didn't enjoy the ending though I thought with all that went on in the book that there would be a different approach to the ending."
1,"I had a hard time getting through this long, boring book",The most boring book i've read in ages. If it wasn't for school I would never have read this book.
1,not great expectations,"after reading this book i think dickens would benifit from very low expectations. and by that i mean a lot of people will be returning this book and giving bad reviews. all the classics always in my opinion, are very bad"
5,A Great Novel,"This novel, written by Charles Dickens, shows us that we cannot achieve happiness from money. It also teaches us that if we succumb to our desires we will end up losing in life. I recommend this beautifully written masterpiece to anyone who enjoys reading"
4,Just Great!,"Great Expectaitons by Charles Dickens is a good book. I recommend to anyone who enjoys reading realistic fiction books. It captures you from the second you open the book wntil you put it down. It has humor, action, and romance in it. I enjoyed reading it beacse the plot was good as well and the character's personalities."
3,My First Dickens Novel,"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."
2,Great Expectations,"I had to read this book over the summer. I like the beginning and towards the middle, but actually when I was reaching the end, it became extremely boring and lengthy. Overall, I didn't like this book as much as I heard about it."
3,WAIT!,"I liked this book, I really did, I promise. But in my opinion, Dickens's other novel ""Nicholas Nickleby"" is much, much better.So before you buy this book, check out ""Nicholas Nickleby"" as well. Maybe you can buy both. :) Just don't go with ""Great Expectations"" because it is more well-known. That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."
3,Great Expectations Review,"I thought this book was a little hard to understand with the way they talked. Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on. I liked this novel though the story was great in how all the events that took place connected to something else in the end of the story.My favorite parts in this book were when Pip was finding more and more about Estella and her family because it kept you wanting to read more and more of the story so you could find out what happened. The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."
2,Have Low Expectations,"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books. I ask myself, ""If this book were published today by some unknown author, what would I think of it?"" Perhaps this isn't a fair way to judge a classic, but that's the method I use.PROS OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS:- It has outstanding character development.- It's a story about people and relationships.- Good, authentic dialog.- A nice moral story.CONS:- Painfully slow pacing.- Long-winded writing style, long paragraphs.- Few characters that are that agreeable.CONCLUSION: Have low expectations when you read ""Great Expectations."" Modern books have much faster pacing and are more easy to read. For those who love the classics, they will love this book. I, however, preferred ""A Tale of Two Cities."""
5,True side of human nature,"Dickens explores various sides of human nature in Great Expectations, as he tells the story of Pip, a common, lower-class, laboring boy who shows his desire to become a civilized gentleman. Along the storyline, Dickens inserts several points that man has several sides. The book is excellent in depicting how easily betrayal can occur, how quickly man can turn on his closest friend.A very well written story, Great Expectations continuously keeps the reader interested with its intriguing occurences."
1,Wanted More of a Hardcover,"I wanted to start collecting the Penguin Classics hardcover editions, and I needed this book for a class so I bought it, and I guess I'm glad I hadn't bought a couple other novels to round out my purchase! The cover was rubbing off by the time it arrived to me, in a padded box. However the print on the cover is made, it is done very shoddily and couldn't handle being on a shelf, much less being read. I am very unhappy indeed. Phooey on whoever came up with this."
5,Refreshing and Entertaining for All Ages,"I have read Great Expectations more than 2 times. I have listened to it also on Audio CD more than a few times. I occasionally just listen to any randomly selected track(s) at any randomly selected part of the story in it's unabridged version.I was excited to hear it in an abridged version and with several persons portraying the various characters.As much as I love the unabridged reading of the story; I was quite pleased with the acting out of the story in this radio-presentation-like recreation of Great Expectations.It was refreshing that Pip's dialogue was a faithful recreation of the actual text due to him being the character telling the story; so the Dickens' wonderful wordsmithing was not lost.It is a great story for all ages, to listen and learn to love; and I hope for their sake, to encourage them to read the story in its entirety."
2,writing on pages to cramed,"I bought this book on Amazon about a year or so ago & just was really turned off by how much writing they cramed into even one page & the font is pretty small, it turned me off to the point that I never did even read the book, to those that did, hope it was good."
4,MET GREAT EXPECTATIONS,CLASSIC. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY CHILD TO READ OVER THE SUMMER AND IT BOUGHT BACK SO MANY MEMORIES. I'M GLAD WE HAVE A COPY TO KEEP AROUND THE HOUSE.
5,Great way to experience Great Expectations,"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book. This unabridged version brings the Dicken's story to life. There are 16 CD's to listen to, but it is an enjoyable experience."
5,Alpen Spotting Scope,Great scope and service from the Alpen headquarters. The tripod supplied with the scope had a screw which had been cross threaded not allowing the scope to be mounted to the tripod. One call to Alpen and and a replacement was mailed immediately. Nice to have good timely service.
3,"Great fun, but gets boring . . . .","When I got this game, I was thrilled and amazed at how complex it was: you can purchase your dog from a kennel, name it with your own voice, and talk to it, pet it, interact with it. But after awhile the game gets very repetitive. Feed. Water. Go for walk. Go to the park. Enter a competition. Feed. Water. Walk . . . you get the idea. As you earn ""trainer points"" (by interacting with your dog, winning competitions, etc.) you can unlock items and new breeds, which is pretty fun.Overall, as a person who grooms, shows and helps breed dogs for a living, the realism in the game is fantastic, but it does get old!"
3,Well......,"The game is fun, but you have a LOT of responsibility.I got this game and it was fun.Then I found out that you have to feed it twice a day or your dog(s) will starve and run away.Even if you take the game out of your DS.It can get frustrating training your dog.I have homework and ALSO I have a virtual dogs to take care of.I NEED A BRAKE FROM MY DOGS BEFORE I GO CRAZY!!!!Also I'll have more homework next year and STILL A VIRTUAL DOG!!!!"
1,Ruby Payne claptrap,"This book is designed to alleviate the poverty of the author at the expense of children in classes with teachers who have absorbed her awful message. As a cultural anthropologist with 35 years of research experience in urban American, I can say without hesitation that this is not just over-simplified; it is a set of racist stereotypes that have been adduced without any kind of systematic or acceptable evidence. She has made a fortune as a ""motivational speaker."" She is no scholar, and her work can worsen the very problems she claims to be trying to solve."
4,It's about time!,Waiting for years for this release on CD. This is the best Scorpions. It is crued but it still surpasses anything that they've done. Don't expect the polished Scorpions of the Eighties because it's not here but either is the clique'd pop rock that they thought would please their audiences. Sometimes a young mind is the best creative mind. Innoccent & not mainstream. Expressive & not polished. Check out the lineup. Both the Schenker's are here. Get it raw & right from the young Scorpions!
2,Great Music But CD Doesn't Play Loud Enough,"Scorpions ""Lonesome Crow"" is a great album. But this version of the cd does not play loud enough. I have three other Scorpions cds: ""Fly To The Rainbow"" (Japanese Import), ""In Trance"" (Japanese Import) and ""Virgin Killer"" (France Import). The three cds play 2 or 3 times louder than the ""Lonesome Crow"" cd when you put it on the same volume of the cd player or mp3 player. It is unfortunate when a record label does not do a good job with recording a cd with full volume like a cd should play. Especially with 24 bit remastering available to use. Japan is re-releasing ""Lonesome Crow"" on a SHM (Super High Material) CD. Hopefully it will play much louder than this version."
5,Wonderful!,"First off, this is NOT the Scorps of the 80's. This is a band that took a very musical, dark and dreamy route to a perfect Album. Lonesome Crow is amazing and musically it just blows me away. Its hard to believe that this band transitioned into the Scorpions that brought you Blackout and Love at First Sting. Buy this if you appreciate a more intense, psychodelic style of music. I do believe the Scorps must have been eating some mushrooms when writing this! The follow up to this, ""Fly to the Rainbow"" is another amazing example of this bands diversity. Rock on forever Scorps!"
4,Excellent bathroom reading,"Has some errors and odd omissions, but I still learn something every time I pick it up. The online version is far more complete ... but I don't have a computer in my bathroom, yet."
2,typical...,Steve Erlewine is the typical snobby Rolling Stone/Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame critic.This book won't help you in any way...
3,Not worth getting a BD version,"As with every Blu-Ray title, the review is in two pieces. The movie part, and the BD part.The Movie is dated, and should be regarded as such. You cannot purchase this and expect modern editing or storylines. Story and everything is very trite, and somewhat contrived at times. Not sure why many consider this to be such a classic, since I found the story somewhat lacking and unconvincing. Still, being a classic it does have its moments and thus the okay rating.The Blu-ray, well, is DVD-like at best. No reason to get the BD version unless of course you are in a region where it's not released for your region, namely Asia. No supplements of notice or worth, so no gain here whatsover by purchasing it in BD (or even in DVD) form.I'd only recommend this for people who love the original movie and wish to own it, or people like me who just like collecting basketball movies."
2,Blu Ray transfer is awful,"This Blu-ray transfer is just awful for such a great film. The colors are all washed out and the color contrasts are no different than what I would see on DVD. It actually looks a bit worse as you can see all sorts of color problems in the darker locker room scenes. If anything, the high definition blu ray actually accentuates how poor the transfer is! I would almost think that I'm watching an old VHS tape."
5,America Needs This Film,HOOSIERS is one of a handful of movies that make a statement about who we are and what makes our country great. Hoosiers characters are a collection of beaten down and worn out souls who have been dealt a lifetime of seemingly hopelessness and mediocrity. Individually they will remain destined to this fate for eternity. As a group they can rise beyond all hope and make a statement from which their lives will become enriched from what they are able to accomplish given that initial spark and making the commitment to give it their all. Composer Jerry Goldsmith must have seen greatness at the core of this film because he gave us one of the most inspiring scores ever composed for a film. All the actors give us so much more than we have ever seen as well. Each one contributed their best piece to the pie and that is what our country is truly all about.
3,Good but not wonderful,"I enjoyed this movie, but it appeared to show it's age. On the same genre, I prefer ""Miracle"" or ""Rudy""."
5,Can't do without it,This is definitely the item you can't do without to keep your vehicle running in a good condition. You won't regret to have it.
2,This P.Shop Class-OK for Web Use ONLY- Not Image improvement,"If your lookking for the latest on web design techniques, you will enjoy this teaching seminar. If you are looking for image improvement skills, color management to print, etc. , this set of tapes will leave you very disappointed."
4,"For the price, what I expected",A relatively cheap cable but it does the job. I am not sure it will hold up for very long as this has been my experience with cheap cables.
1,Worked for a little time...,"When this thing worked, it worked out ok...I've definitely heard better quality out of cables but hey...you get what you pay for.However, it stopped working after only a couple of weeks.How many stars does a cable get when it can't supply it's basic function for more than two weeks?One."
1,Wrong cables,They didn't send me 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2 RCA Male Cable 5 ft. I got 3.5mm Stereo Plug to 3.5mm Stereo Plug 12ft.
2,Painfully disappointing,"I am an absolute devotee of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series. I have read all of them at least three times each. But ""The Yellow Admiral"" appalled me. I was certain within fifty pages that it had been written by someone else who had picked up all of O'brian's turns of phrase, but none of his wit or heart. I wrote an indignant letter to the publisher demanding my money back, but then never sent it. It's embarrassing to admit how passionately I feel about this - I mean, it's only a book, right? But this book was so poorly done it would have been funny had I not been so eagerly awaiting it. Diana's pronouncements on sex! and Sophie's transformation to a shrew! Sir Joseph's tortured explanations re: Stephen's character to a clerk! I would have been far happier had it never been published - it was like watching close friends disintegrate before my eyes."
5,An Excellent Book that I Use For My Catechism Class!!!,"The late Frank Sheed (a Roman Catholic from Australia) wrote this book in the 1940s during the pontificate of Pope Pius XII. It was later republished by Ignatius Press and remains one of the most essential and unforgetable Catholic books in America.He talks greatly about free will, the creation of Man, the test of Angels and Men, the difference between free will and predestination (the Protestant Calvinist notion), the Sacrifice of the Mass, and more importantly---WHO IS GOD?I love it because it is a great in depth book of understanding Catholic Theology. The Scripture quotations are from the Douay Rheims Bible and the Revised Standard Version: Catholic Edition.I recommend this book for all Catholics and non-Catholics as well. It was one of the best textbooks I used for catechism class in my parish church."
5,Ambient/trance/breaks masterpiece,"This album is absolutely astonishing. At first, I didn't think much of it, but I had a feeling it would grow on me. Within two weeks it was a permanent fixture in my cd player. I have made several copies for myself now; one at home, one in the car, one at work... And the strange thing is, the more I listen to it, the more I want to. This is the best cd I have owned in years, and I own a lot of cds. BUY THIS ALBUM if you like ambient/energy/chill trance and breaks."
5,"""the beginning of Abstract Trance...""","After reading many reviews about one of the most influential trance artsista of all time, Sasha's Airdrawndagger, seemed to be a ""must-have."" I decided to chill to it, rather than dj-ing it immediately, I went for the chill-out method. I knew I wasn't expecting ""Xpander"" style, simply because of Sasha hadn't dj-ed such material at his most recent spins ,(before Airdrawndagger)instead he preferred dj-ing progressive trance and progressive house. After listening to the whole album (which seemed to go by so fast since I was so into it) I found that this really is nothing like ""Xpander"" but almost just as good. What some people don't realize, is that trance does not have a specific sound, trance music is simply any type electronica music, that will put you into a trance. Sasha does this magnificently by the use of atmospheric sounds. Airdrawndagger was well composed. - Alastor"
5,Good Stuff,"This is a very well-produced disc. I wasn't so sure on the first listen, but now after some more spins I'm convinced this is one of the better albums of the year so far.As others have mentioned it isn't a non-stop club stomp. Rather it's the type of disc you listen to over and over again when you are chilling out, constantly noticing new riffs and obscured rhythms.It's very minimalistic in parts, although fairly melodic at the same time. The minimalism is a tribute to the restraint of good producers willing to give the music some space."
4,"""Good Sports Film!""",Tom Hanks and Geena Davis star in Penny Marshall's 1992comedy-drama based on a true story. A woman reflectsbeing part of the first all-girl baseball league with hersister and friends. I've always liked this film and Tomand Geena are great together. This special editionhas good picture and sound plus neat extras.I recommend this good film.
3,Geena Davis gives a brilliant performance,"A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is spectaculary beautiful and very funny. Of all the team players, Davis is the stand out, giving a touchingly modest performance that shows her range and diversity when it comes to choosing parts in cinema. Her split scene is still my favorite scene in a film ever. And I mean ever."
5,A classic,"A great movie, a classic. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The cast is suberb and the performances they give and excellent. There is truly nothing bad about this movie. It is both inspiring and entertaining. One should truly appreciate the topic and the actors in this movie. Madonna probably gives the best performances she ever has given (and maybe could give), Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and everyone else does a good job at making the movie believable and engaging. I highly reccomend it."
3,"""This used to be my childhood dream...""","A League of Their Own directed by Penny Marshall isn't a perfect comedy or sports film but it's good enough thanks to the talented cast. Tom Hanks is perfectly appropriate for this kind of film, he is an alcoholic manager of an all-women baseball team. Geena Davis and Lori Petty play sisters who very much love each other but are highly competitive. And how can you not love Madonna, her song This Used to be my Playground is played at the end of the film. Give this film a viewing sometime, enjoy!"
3,typical chavela :),"Chavela is Chavela, without comparasion because nobody can sing as her. Her style is unique. if you like it or not, everybody recognize her voice."
4,A pleasing performance,"The romantic era featured many touring piano virtuosos, and Xaver Scharwenka was near the top of the class of the virtuosos in the quality of the concerti he wrote. His second and third concerti are more melodic and less virtuosic than the first or fourth, but enjoyable. The performances and recording are solid. This is probably not the best starting point for an interest in Schwarenka, but if you've enjoyed a performance of the first or fourth concerto, dive in!"
2,Good chap stick awful flavor,The zombie flavor is just gross. The chap stuck its selfs is smooth and nice but I couldn't get over the smell of this flavor.
1,Anthropological insights are not for missionaries,"This is a terrible book with a terrible message: that you should use the understanding of other cultures in order to infiltrate and change them. That is NOT the message of anthropology. As an anthropologist, I resent this book profoundly. Anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures, interest in their own ways of being and believing, and the concept of cultural relativism--that a culture's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms. The one thing we do NOT do is try to impose our own ""truths"" on others. If missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is, then read an anthropology book. But this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment, invasion, and destruction. It is arrogant and misguided."
1,Plastic Taste,"We tried everything to get rid of the plastic taste. We ran through plain water, coffee, baking soda, vinegar. All told, we ran through at least 40 cups. It still tastes like plastic -- I'm thinking plastic infused water is not good for us also. My husband is taking it back to Costco this morning"
1,Coffee tastes like an instant blend,"I don't have one of these contraptions, but, some of my friends do. The fresh brewed coffee tastes like it was made with a combination of ground and instant coffee. Since, the machines and the coffee packs are not mine and the single serving packs cost $1 for each cup of coffee, I have not opened a new one up to verify.They're great, if you have money to blow and need something else to impress your friends and neighbors. As for great coffee....I say brew your own with a Melita style coffee maker and premium coffee."
2,Type face and pictures too small,"While the illustrations are beautiful, I need a magnifying glass to see them. I had planned to use this book in my Children's Church class but the pictures are too small for a group to see. Even with glasses, I need a magnifyer to read the book."
1,Almost unreadable because of downsized type,"This is a comment on the new ""compact"" edition of Selina Hastings' Children's Illustrated Bible. I have used the original, full-sized edition with older kids for many years. It's been especially useful in helping older children who have had little exposure to church or Bible do some learning before they are baptized.Recently I ordered 4 copies of the compact edition. It turns out that the type is so small as to be almost unreadable, even for children. The body copy is printed in 7 point type--smaller than phone book text type. The type in the notes under the illustrations and photos is 5 point. This tiny typeface will discourage most children from reading, especially those that are not eager readers to begin with. It will also make it hard for parents to read with their children.I returned the copies I ordered.Rev. Susan Grant RosenCharlestown, New Hampshire"
4,Like the Bible but it is small,I love the book. I wanted a story form of the Bible for school and this is great. I love the detailed pictures and the history lessons of the times. We just read the story about Joseph and his coat of many colors. On the side notes it had what they used for dyes back then. Even a picture of the item they used and the color it produced. Only problem I have is I wish they had made it a bit bigger. The print is so tiny i almost need a magnifying glass to read it.
5,Children's Illustrated Bible,I am using this book for Sunday School. We are going through the Bible in a year. It has been wonderful and the kids are really learning a lot!
5,My first intro to the Bible,"I found this book in a library when I was 10, and I immediately became enthralled by the stories and illustrations. What's especially amazing is that I was raised in a secular household. I think it seemed a little weird to my family that I loved this book so much. I found this book again in my step-mom's collection and it's still just as enchanting as it was then. The illustrations are colorful and lively, and the text gives me something to learn from even today. Even as a kid, I was interested in learning about the history of the early Church and Judaism. Today I am Christian and I hope that other children find Jesus through this book."
1,Amazon needs to have better descriptions.,"Let me first say that my son has this Bible in the normal size version. I thought I would order one from here to give as a gift for my nephew. Like most here, I thought I was buying the larger version of this book. I had no idea it was 1/4 the size. There is way too much text (thus a very small font) to make this wonderful Bible to be of any use. I had to return it."
2,Tiny Bible Tiny Print,The book was beautiful - but I was expecting to be able to actually read it - it has minute font size. My son saw it and loved it immediately - maybe because it is small and he loves the pictures - but the print is REALLY small & uncomfortable for me to read to him.
3,"creative & original but want more ""sticking power""","Much respect for this artist who is not afraid to experiment. So much genre integration in the music: reggae, soul, folk... Songwriting is brave and original. But I think what makes me respect this artist so much is the same thing that hinders the enjoyment a little, if that makes any sense. None of the songs ""stick"" for me. Although I appreciate them, I don't hear them in my head afterward. Would love to hear more dynamics in the vocal lines. Look forward to tracking this artist's growth."
4,A good book on Java security,"This book makes me nostalgic for the early SAMS Publishing Unleashed series of books on Java. Remember when you first learned what a servlet was? That's the feeling I get when reading Enterprise Java Security. The book does a good job explaining how Secure Sockets Layer (SSL,) object-level security, Kerberos, and legacy security came about. It then shows detailed examples with sample code how to implement each of the security techniques. The text is surprisingly complete, including coverage of Web Service Security protocols and techniques."
2,'Natural Foods? Just another mainstream American Cookbook.,"With the words 'natural foods' heading the title, I expected to find whole foods, vegetarian dishes, and low fat recipes. I did not. This cook book is exactly like every mainstream American cookbook I have encountered, it is full of meat recipes. Only 12 recipes made it into the vegetable section. In addition, there are ingredients called for such as 'canned mushrooms', 'packaged onion soup mix' and 'undiluted cream of mushroom soup'. One sauce recipe for a meat dish, called for a half pound of butter! I am not what I consider to be a health nut, but this book fell far short of my expectations.I could not find a publication date, so I am assuming that this book was written before there was clear health information on eating whole, low fat, foods."
1,Cover was bent itm looked used.,"Sent book as an Xmas gift. Book was purchased in NEW condition, however, there was a large crease in the front cover. This is nit what I would call new. Would have bought a used book for less if I had know they would ship a book in poor condition. Xmas was a month ago. Two email complaints have already been sent without response. Do not recommend this company!!!"
1,EXTREMELY Short Bettery Life,Batteries didn't last even a 1/2 hour in my portable cd player. Package of 4 lasted me less then 1 hour playing time.
2,Received different product,"I did not receive the Kodak batteries pictured on Amazon. Instead, I got Varta Photo Alkaline batteries made in Germany. Oh well, at least it has an expiration of June 2011."
4,Waiting for the second book to begin,"""Waiting for the World to End"" is a book everyone can relate to in one way or another. The characters are well-thoughtout and very likable. This book has just about everything you would like to read about: love, denial, lonliness, sadness, joy, sports, religion, etc. It's a very fun and exciting novel to read. It'll have you never wanting to put it down."
4,Tainted Love,"""Waiting for the World to end"" is a fabulous book that takes place right in my own home-town of Valparaiso Indiana.It brings up many different opinions and touches on a various amount of topics, such as; relationships, divorce, death, abortion,marriage, and alcohol abuse. Nicloe Hunter is the author of this novel, she brings a wide variety of views on the incidents that take place in the story. You'll constantly be guessing what prediciment Tom Olsen, the main character, will be putting himself in next. For example, Tom is an english teacher and basketball coach at Indian River High School.He becomes absolutely infatuated with his best and favorite player's mom.That very situation causes even more inner problems for Tom. To find out what happends next or ride the rollercoaster of events in Tom's life, read this great novel."
3,In all,"In all; The book was good. It's appealing to young adults as well as older, and it's hard for an author to capture such a broad audience , but yo did. congrats!"
4,Awesome!,"Nicole Hunter did an amazing job writing this book. Nicole uses everyday life and problems into her characters she created, not just the perfect fairytale life. Hunter influenced everyone who read it. She keeps her readers entertained and created a twisted ending."
4,An Inspiring Novel,"""Waiting for the World to End"" was a real touching novel. The characters could relate to so many people that I have met in my life. I liked the conflicts in the book between Tom, Mary, and Ben, between Tom and his mom, and between Tom and himself. For example, how Tom was falling for Mary, and how Tom and Ben were very close in and out of school and basketball. The relationship between Tom and his mom wasn't a great one because his mom always thought he could do better in life than what he had already done. Tom's conflicts with himself caused him to have a hard time dealing with the fact that he had an abortion a while back with an old girlfriend Alexandra, when to find out now that he does want a child of his own. Tom did not deal with that problem so well, so every night he would come home and he would try to drown his memories by drinking, and that caused him to have a hard time to keep a relationship with anyone. Over all I thought the book was very good."
4,The Review for WfTWtE,"My class and I started reading this book in 11th grade English class. I really didn't like the book at first because I don't like reading books. After I got past the first chapter I was really into it. I didn't want to put down the book. Tom Olsen, the main character in this book, related a lot to me. Always caring for someone when he can't have them. Also he just likes to be alone most of the time. That really related to myself. I really can't believe that I got into a book like I did. It has high school life in it and it has college life in it too. Most of the book's setting is Indiana, in a high school named Indian River. If you're like me and you don't like to read, then this book will change your point of view."
2,IMAGINATION,WHEN I READ A BOOK I DO NOT CHOOSE TO KEEP TRYING TO USE MY IMAGINATION I PREFER THE AUTHOR TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE AND I DID NOT FEEL MUCH FOR THIS BOOK
1,Waiting for This Book to End,"The dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters. Here's the premise: a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and, after a few seconds, he's madly and deeply in love, the dilemma on which the rest of the plot depends. I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn't happen. This book is not worth anyone's time. It's author obviously thought writing a good book wasn't worth her time and it's definitely not worth yours."
3,Waiting on the World to End,"The book Waiting for the World to End was the first book that actually intrigued me enough to sit and read the entire thing. I liked how the book was easy to follow and that it showed the conflicts that Tom and Mary encountered. I did not like how the book ended because it was very open ended, but I would recommend this book to other people, and I think that it is a good and easy read for younger people."
3,"Good Intent on Coverage, Just didn't deliver","George and his Father meant well when trying to cover the genocide in Darfur, but lacked a load of information crucial to comprehending how and why this area in Sudan is going through such. Not to mention, the footage is only 25 minutes long. Too short of a documentary in my opinion. Sent back for a refund. Needed more content."
2,Inept. Flat. Read Something Else.,"This feels like a book-length article from a pulp crime magazine like ""True Detective"" or ""Crime Story Monthly."" It's curiously bloodless (figuratively & stylistically) and lurches along without highlighting the flashy stuff. It's almost a complete misfire-- if you want to know about Legs Diamond, read something else (William Kennedy's fictionalized version, for instance)."
5,c'mon!! !,why is this available for international if amazon only charge priority mail and then thanks to that we have to pay taxes in europe and go to the AIRPORT to get it?????? standard mail will work fine.. . no extra taxes no more problems...
2,Typical boring theory lessons - what I was afraid I would get,"I didn't like this DVD. I am an intermediate guitar player who never learned any theory. After deciding to learn some I purchased this and it was everything I expected. It is a bunch of diagrams and shots of a guy's hand playing notes on a guitar neck. The information is valid and you can learn chord theory from this but it is really boring to watch and there is hardly any qualifying information. I found a couple of guys on youtube that did much better jobs of teaching this material - and it was free. Also, the lessons revolve around reading sheet music - who reads sheet music anymore? I need TAB!"
4,Did the job,The headphones were what I expected. I use them when I mow the lawn and they get the job done. For the price they worked well.
1,A skewed story,"Just in case you think any of what this writer said is real, I'll bet you that most of it was lies.Yes, Jack was murdered. Yes, the sisters were tried. The only injustice, however, is that Peggy wasn't found guilty.You see, the lovely thing about tv shows and books is that they can skew reality into whatever they want them to say. They don't always show what REALLY happened.You wanna know what REALLY happened with Jack, Peggy, James, and Betty? Why don't you read through The Huntsville Times for the past 10 years? I'll bet you didn't know that Betty Wilson had actually plotted to have Jack murdered at least once before.Yes, James is a liar, but who knows? He could've actually been telling the truth.I actually know one of the people who was a witness in the trial. I knew the victim (he was my family's eye doctor). I know what went on, and this book is an all-out lie."
5,"tastes good, convenient","I bought these meals for my son in the Army. He keeps Kosher and never has enough to eat without supplements. He loves that they are low cal, tasty and convenient. Also, Amazon has best pricing by far."
4,great,"this is a great lube me a my girl frend love it the only issue is its hard to get out of some ""areas"""
3,Works well,"I agree with other reviewers, it works well. However, it smells just like the solution you use to blow bubbles. Kind of tainted my view of bubbles ever since..."
3,Sharpe's Rut,"Cornwell's heroic character falls to new levels of debauchery in this, one of the author's poorer efforts. Killing off the opposition comes a little too easily in this tale, and the adulterous, implausible hookup of Sharpe and his new romantic interest are far too rank for good entertainment. Sharpe is no angel in other Corwell novels, but in this one, he appears more the bad guy, full of deceit, passion, and revenge.Meanwhile, the battle scenes and nautical information are great. Like someone suggested, it might be better to skip the first part of the book."
2,Nine Inch Yellow Nails,Undifferentiated pop industrial music in the style of Nine Inch Nails. There is a reason you haven't heard of this band.
4,Nice book,I'm always a little leery with MS books but this one is really good. It gives advice and even tells you about different medications to help each symptom. Its a newer book with more recent information.
3,A Slender Thread,"I found this book an uneven effort, addressing very different topics, with these topics at times only tenuously connected to the great English river. It is more a book of essays on London or broader English social history--with the notion of the Thames included in all, whether needed or not. For example, the exploits of London's red mayor, Ken Livingstone, do not strike me as being central to the book's title. Some of the chapters are very good at explaining some interesting aspect or another of the history of England, like the infamous prison hulks once located on the Thames, flood control, and fine art as inspired by the ancient river. Professor Schneer is not a fan of the modern Conservative party and this bias is reflected in the final chapters."
5,Life changing!,"This book inspired me as a adolescent. It, and my father (an enlisted man who gained his commision) inspired me to join the Air Force to serve my country and, hopefully, lead troops. I accomplished both. Unfortunately, the ""Courtney Massengales"" are winning in the institution, so I'm turning down promotion and getting out. This is the finest novel of the American military and the idealism of young men. It should be required reading for anyone who aspires to leadership."
5,Excellent book,I truly enjoyed reading this book. I can't put it down. You will also enjoy this book. I will look for more books to purchase soon. Major Paul
2,Couldn't get through Once An Eagle,"No offense to anyone that loves this book, but I just couldn't get through it. The corny dialogue and cliched descriptive passages make the book seem as if it is aimed at boys between the ages of 10 and 14. Also, I was annoyed that every female character in this book is completely one-dimensional."
5,Incredible book/Anybody have info on the Tv mini-series?,"I concur with most of the other reviews...read this years agoand never forgot it. We could use real military leaders with this sort of true vision in light of the Iraq situation. IMO David Hackworth was a lot like him!THIS is what I'd like to hear feedback on. Sam Elliot played the lead in the TV miniseries based on this book, maybe 20-25 years ago??? It was great!I have never been able to find any mention of the tv productionand would love to see it on DVD! Any info appreciated."
5,for those who want to know more,"Pihkal is a cornerstone of the counter culture library. Read it for the rich story of Sasha & Ann, read it for science, read it for history, read it for personal introspection.... but be sure to keep an open mind."
3,A good book on movie locations but,"I hope nobody wasted any time trying to match up the Gunga Din picture on page 74 to the sand dunes of the lower Colorado River. It was filmed mostly in Lone Pine, California. That scene of British gatling gunners was filmed just off Whitney Portal Road."
1,don't waste your time,"After reading Like Water for Chocolate, I excitedly anticipated Laura Esquivel's new novel. I hope it was a poor translation, because otherwise, her editor should look for a new job."
1,Not really a novel,"Interested as I am in the subject matter, I was very disappointed in this book. It would be better labeled ""Meditations of Malinche,"" as the book is overly heavy in giving us the interior thoughts of this historical figure. And these hemorrhage in rhetorical questions. What I most missed was that the novel failed to make the larger than life characters and events of this period of Mexican history come alive in three, palpitating dimensions. The language often turns lyrical, poetic, symbolical and/or abstract, removing me from the events narrated instead of immersing me in them."
5,"Keeps Getting Better & Better, no problems with these discs!!","Well, here we are, another great season if Bewitched. This season is classic. From the lovable Uncle Aurther to Wonderful Aunt Clara, This season is really funny. This season has such great episodes as: The first Thanksgiving. Where Aunt Clara transports the Stevens clan & Gladys Kravitz back in time to the first Thanksgiving with the pilgrams. Another fine episode is Mc Tavish, Where Sam goes to England to get rid of a pesty ghost. One of my favorites is the flying saucer. Aunt Clara changes a little toy flying saucer into a real flying saucer with martians on board, that look like dogs. These are all clasic shows that can never be replaced, no matter how hard anyone tries. They will live in our hearts for a long time to come. Our Childrens Children will probably be watching these long after we are all gone. I haven't had any problems with my discs either. They all play great. The CC works good also."
5,Love,I love these old TV shows. This was a good buy for the amount of shows you get. It came quickly too!
5,Interesting reading - buy it!,"I'm still reading and enjoying the short, non-fiction accounts of the people in this book. I suggest you buy it."
4,2ldk,"The whole film takes place in an apartment. Two female actresses who share the place fight over the same film role and boyfriend. They piss each other off with different issues and end up in an all-out-war. From a Chainsaw to an electrocution, you get a heavy bit of extreme violence. I enjoyed all the fighting. I also enjoyed their conversations and what they were really thinking at the time, now that was funny. It's a film with a simple plot and ironic ending."
5,Awesome record!,"This is pop so well-crafted and catchy that it just leaves me speechless. I bought this last weekend and have wandered around since then humming Puppet Grrls R Go. That is, when I'm not humming Cellophane. I just can't help it. Now I may just have to buy the imports, although I really wish all of these discs would be domestically released as they should be. Wondermints R Go!"
4,The Joy of Pop,"This was my first exposure to the music of the Wondermints and I'm very impressed. Impressed enough that I plan to get some more albums by this band. I wouldn't call this power pop, it's more like clever and multi-layered pop. Lots of influences, some of which are obvious and others more subtle, but the grand result is a very listenable album. Some tunes are straightforward pop, others have with a slight psyche or experimental edge to them, but it's all very well done and very catchy. Good pick!"
2,Not Gangster Chronicles,"How does one reduce a great mini-series like Gangster Chronicles to a 2 hour movie (Gangster Wars)? Not very well! The result omits major parts of the miniseries, is choppy, and difficult to follow. Mobsters is a much better alternative, but is still not Gangster Chronicles - I want the original!"
2,Is this a fairy tale,"What is reported in the book may be true but the author has definately taken poetic licence in the telling of the events. Is Wilkerson such a meglomeanic that he sees this book as an appendage to the Acts of the Apostles? Maybe so. The pictures that are contained in the book come from the movie which starred Pat Boone.Several references are made to the devil. As a matter of fact, the devil is mentioned as mush as God in this book.I have also heard Wilkerson preach. He should enroll himself at some divinity school and learn the concepts of Christianity"
2,Extremely graphic and detailed-cumbersome reading,"The book outlays every detail of the Indiana 19th's movement during the Gettysburg campaign all of the way down the graphic depictions of death scenes. It was difficult to gain an overview of the regiments role within the larger conflict (which I anticipated) due to lengthy explanations of specific individuals movements. The details were thouroughly researched and presented in a very logical manner, but the importance the 19th played in this pivotal battle was underscored by long-winded explanations of each death that occurred during the three year period being studied. Approximately 1/3 of the books contents were detailed footnotes and this made the reading somewhat difficult."
4,Some good reads,"While the copyright of this collection is 1971, which is almost 40 years ago, many of the stories within contain references and subject matter to much earlier times. Many of the stories contain ""olde english"" and talk of times as early back as 1500 or 1600. Mostly the stories do contain a common element in that they are for the most part actually scary. Having read many horror anthologies that put me right to sleep at night, this one will give you a few scares, a pleasant surprise seeing I got the book on the cheap."
3,Tough to get through...,"I had kind of a hard time with this book. It was very long, and the style of writing didn't jive too well with me. Of course, I don't know who I am to criticize Cardinal Newman. I still would recommend this to those wanting a fuller understanding of how tradition develops, but I like Congar's book ""The Meaning of Tradition"" a lot better. Shorter, more readable, and to the point."
2,killed by the ending,"I read this book and thought I had an understanding of the characters. Then we get to the last quarter of the book and everything is completely unexpected except for the killer. I had that figured out in the beginning. I don't believe true suspense in mysteries is achieved by having characters in the end doing completely unexpected, out of character things."
2,"Mediocre plot, mediocre characters","A young, innocent girl is viciously murdered on a small island in Puget Sound. This homicide, the island's first, rocks the community, shaking loose endemic anti-Semitism and racism. The trouble is, the author practically gives away the identity of the murderer early on and then has to throw in many red herrings as a distraction. Finally, the conclusion is frustrating and sloppy, leaving this ready mighty disastisfied."
3,Not as good as her first novel,Guilt by associaton is my favourite book and I eagerly anticipated Sloan's next book. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. A good read all the same.
3,"Great book, but.....","The book was great, the first I've read by this author. Plot was suspenseful and gripping. One problem. Sloan introduces policewoman Ginger. Describing her in a way we think she's going to play the hero. A smart, quick woman. Not so. Turns out sloan makes her dim-witted. For a policewoman, she jumps to conclusions, fails to follow up, and bases 'facts' upon rumors. It's disappointing to see a woman portrayed this way. Also that Ginger has a gun drawn when making an arrest without any apparent threat. Not realistic. If you can get past the bad character of Ginger ( and the letdown of one of the leading woman characters being an idiot) then the book is very entertaining."
5,GREAT SECOND NOVEL!!!!,"This is an TRULY EXCELLENT novel. I literally could not put this book down! Generally, I never read a book that does not have either the Literary Guild or the Book-of-the Month Main Selection designation. I read ""An Isolated Incident"" because Susan Sloan's 1st novel was so GOOD. Why this second novel did not get the LITERARY GUILD designation is beyond me. This novel should have been on the NATIONAL BESTSELLER LIST for at least 6 months! Perhaps the publishers marketing of this book was at fault. Sometimes the cover itself is the only reason a book doesn't make it to the list. Can't wait for her 3rd novel!"
1,This is the WORSE book I've ever read.,"I feel that its my civil duty to warn people not to waste their hard earned money and precious time reading this book. I bought this book based upon the author's name. I LOVED her first novel, and thought this would be along the mystery, emotion and suspense would be of the same level. Instead, I found myself half-way through the novel wondering if I should discard it, or hope for the best. It takes forever to start, the characters, once developed are so flawed and unlikable that it simply turns to a disappointment. The ""good"" guys turn into a new form of ""bad"". BTW, this is a murder mystery, and when she finally gets to wrapping it up, the ending and the motive for the murder are swept under the carpet. You are more then welcome to try to get through this horrid novel, but again, I highly recommend spending your time and money on either her first novel, or something new altogether."
2,Great photos!,"This book has a lot of great photos, mostly in color. The information is pretty good, but there are some areas that seem to have gaps in the narrative. I also would have liked more in-depth information relating to Hasbro instead of mostly the kind of information that you can get from a list. The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it lacks any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information. Sadly, it is not a warm, fuzzy book about a children's toy!"
5,Forget the rest this is the best book ever written on GI Joe,"I have been collecting GI Joe figures and accessories for a long time, and I have seen every book that has been written on the subject. Derryl DePriest's new book is by far, the most informative, well-written book ever done. Curt Fukuda's photography is stunning, and it is nice to see the figures posed in ACTION, rather then the stiff mannequins that we see in so many other books. The text is witty and informative and the price guide is the first ""honest and fair"" guide to vintage GI Joe that I have ever seen. So many ""collectible"" books are incomplete or slanted by the views and opinions of the authors, but this book treats all items equally and it shows. There is none of the bias towards 60's era GI Joe or disregard for the 70's era GI Joe's that are normally found in GI Joe books. Forget the rest, this is the best."
5,By far the best GI Joe book available!,"Authoritative, factual and often very humorous this is by far the best book on GI Joe. The photos are outstanding and the descriptions give further dimension to a toy already so rich in memories. As a GI Joe collector I must say that Mr. DePriest provides the most detailed and real world price guide I have ever seen. By pricing each item individually he gives a realistic picture of what you should expect to pay, or receive, if you are buying or selling these items at a garage sale, flea market, on in an internet auction. As a collector's resource, or for a late babyboomer looking to revisit the backyard exploits of their childhood, this book is indispensable."
3,One Summer Day In Rural Iowa,Very little nudity in this video. It did have some full nudity in two segments at the end of the video.
1,Utterly stupid,"As a philosophy professor for three decades, I have taught this wretched book several times in survey courses in 20th century philosophy. It has gone through numerous printings, and so has seemed to capture the respect of a good number of Anglo-American professors. However, Reichenbach's reading of the history of philosophy is wrong on every count; it is no wonder that Einstein, whose student he once was, ridicules Reichenbach in ""Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist."" Although I endeavored to keep my view out of lectures, my undergraduates were able to point to Reichenbach's superficiality and his errors at every turn.So, one might ask--what is its attraction? For people who would like to avoid the considerable labor of studying the great thinkers of the past with seriousness, this book gives them an easy excuse not to. The book is a pathetic exercise in uninformed and biased revisionism."
1,Poor Quality,I got this fan February 11. It's April 29th and it's already squealing. I wouldn't mind so much except I spent more money in hopes that it would last longer. The fan is cheaply made...you just need to feel it to see that.
4,good New Age,"Uakti is a band of Brazilian musicians who have produced a series of very good cds combining a certain ambience (especially, the atmospheres of Amazonia) with New Age instrumental sensibilities to create a very light, and often sweet and warm, result. The arrangements employ any number of specially constructed flutes and percussion instruments. The nearest act I can compare them with is the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, minus the latter's quirkiness. All of their albums are about equally good and in general sound pretty much alike, yet each contains notable melodic hooks that will draw you in even after one hearing."
3,Not her best but a good story!,"A good solid romance with strong women characters. But, I have to say it was not one of the best ones she has written.Lottie dreams of writing a ""gothic style romance"" which is popular in her day. So much that she decides that on the night of her ""coming out"" party she will sneak out of a window to be able to catch a glimpse at the man the tabloids has dubbed the ""murderess Marques"". But as most of her follies do this one gets her in a giant heap of trouble. In the end she married the Marques and finds out she is not only a wife (but in name only) but a mother. She decided to take solace in her writing. Which as usual doesn't go as she had planned..."
3,Fine Recording,"Julie Andrews as Mrs. Anna is a match made in heaven and should have been her return to Broadway instead of the gawd awful Victor/Victoria. She was at the perfect time in her life for the role and would have created magic.This recording is marvelous, even though it is the film orchestrations, probably because they are lusher and fuller, which is fine. Lea Salonga as Tuptim is delightful, Marylyn Horne singing Lady Thiang is fine and Ben Kingsley, though not Yul but who is?, is admirable as the King. Much better than Lou Diamond Phillips was in the more recent revival.My one, small complaint, is Peabo Bryson. Clearly out of his realm, they should have used a stage singer with a better voice.On a small side note, Accuradio has this recording mixed up with the Donna Murphy, Phillips revival recording."
5,Wow!,"Having heard many versions, I didn't think anyone could produce another one that's refreshing to hear. But this one does it marvelously!Julie Andrews is good as always, but the revelation here is Ms. Lea Salonga who shows she can do different types of music.Get this album; it's good!"
4,Kids enjoy it.,"Merlin keeps resurfacing over hte years and the kids enjoy playing it, as did I when I was younger."
5,Classic comedy,Something about the Facts of Life draws you in........Even if you're not a female. The lessons that Charlotte Rae teaches the girls are of true life experience.
2,Tight around the toe and really slippery bottom,"I bought these thinking they are quite beautiful and have the low heels I am looking for - surely I can walk around town all day in these. Unfortunately that's not the case. Even though the rest of the shoe fits fine my toes are really cramped in these. In addition to the tight front, the bottom of the shoe is made of something that feels like soft plastic, it gets absolutely no traction whatsoever. My feet slips walking on carpet!!! Living in a city with hills I am afraid to walk either up or down the hills for fear I'll slip and fall. Thanks a lot for forcing me to pick out only flat roads to walk on."
4,The book was worth double its cost or more!,"Taxes for Dummies made me so much more knowledgeable about the basics about taxes. It explains the basic items in simple terms, and even expands on items if you dare to want to know more. The tips were a great help as well. I now know the difference among the 1040EZ, 1040A, and 1040. I know when I can itemize and when I shouldn't. It also gave great tips on what I can deduct. If I had not read this book, I would not have known to deduct the interest paid on my student loan (and I didn't even have to use Form 1040!) It is also worth mentioning that I finished the book in one day! I highly recommend this book to people with beginner and intermediate knowledge of taxes."
4,Paleozoic gulag,"Political prisoners are sentenced to exile one billion years in the past, before the appearance of the first land-dwelling lifeforms. The story alternates between the exiles in the past, ageing and battling mental illness brought on by their isolation, and the activities that resulted in their sentences. The primary character, Jim Barrett, struggles to maintain his deteriorating community while investigating the puzzle of a new prisoner who is unlike any of the others. The end is a bit unsatisfying--merely a conversation that wraps up the various plot points. Published in 1967, this novel nevertheless includes some startling predictions of later political developments, including an inconclusive presedential election that had very unfortunate results!"
5,Well done.,I like how she works the whole program herself so you feel that it is not phoney. Some of the views seem to be for men but the work out is mostly for women. Well done.
2,BAD MOVIE...,"BAD MOVIE.. TAKE THE STORY AWAY FROM HALLOWEEN 1 AND 2. THERE IS NO MICHAEL MYERS IN THIS ONE, HE ISN'T EVEN MENTIONED. THEY SHOULD HAVE NAMED IT THE SEASON OF THE WITCH. THIS SHOULDN'T BE A PART OF THE HALLOWEEN SERIES. THAT SAID, THE MOVIE STINKS. IT IS DRAWN OUT AND BY THE FIRST DEATH, YOU DON'T EVEN CARE WHO DID IT. BY THE MIDDLE YOU HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT AND STILL DON'T CARE. THE ACTORS TRY TO BE BELIEVABLE IN THIS ONE, BUT IT SHOWS THAT THEY CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT IS OVER TOO. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. THE TRUE CONTINUATION OF THIS SERIES IS HALLOWEEN H2O."
1,The movie sucked,"Michael Myers isn't even in this sequel, that made it stupid and the plot sucked and there was absolutely no reason to make it. they shouldn't have called it a Halloween movie, it was a discrace to all the other Halloween movies which rocked."
1,Don't be fooled by the title HALLOWEEN III.,"Michael Myers isn't in this one. Need I say more? This movie sucked! It was lame and it resembled more of a BODY SNATCHERS type of film. Explicilty bloody, but still sucked as far as plot. This film is a disgrace to be known as HALLOWEEN III! Don't even bother renting this one. You'll just be wasting your money and time."
1,"Gives a new definition to the phrase ""bad movie""","Buy or rent this movie only if you have nothing else to do with 2 hours of your life. Not only did this movie not belong in the series, it had a moronic plot, poor effects, poor acting and a annoying little song to accompany it. ""Ten more days 'till halloween""....(aka, London Bridge is falling down). I watched it once because I WAS dedicated to the series. Stick with Halloween, Halloween 2 and Halloween H20. Be true to your ghoul!"
4,a different direction,Takes the franchise in a different direction if you are looking for Michael Myers you came to the wrong place... It's silver shamrock masks here to terrorize kids this year
4,"Great concept, really good film!!!","This film indeed deserves some sort of credit for originality and taking an idea plus putting a new twist on it. It's one of those underrated little gems of the 80's which I came to enjoy. The plot lacks a bit and the acting is pretty bland but the overall idea was awesome. Not very creepy but obscure enough to appease people who like a little mix of Sci-Fi and Horror. The soundtrack is really good also. Minimal electronic music with synths before it morphed into underground club music. If you're a fan of Halloween as a holiday, you may like this film for its seasonal appeal."
2,potential lost,"Halloween three did something great that the later halloween movies stepped on...it tried to change the series. I am a long time fan of the halloween michael myers series (1-6 that is), bu i can honestly say it was dragged on a bit too long. Halloween three trie to take it in a new direction which could have given the halloween series far more potential for future great movies. However fans of Halloween three over look one small fact...the movie sucked. It had a nonsense script with a failure villian who had the worst way ofattacking his victims...selling thewm halloween masks. had this movie been done with a little more style then maybe we'd still be seeing new, original halloween movies roll out, but face the facts people original or not good idea or not this movie was terrible."
2,Shouldn't have been made!,"A movie about a man who manufactures halloween masks which will kill all the children who wear them on Halloween night.For the fans of Michael Myers, don't expect to see him here! This movie has no ties to the previous two, or to the future installments of Halloween. As for the movie itself... The plot wasn't very good. The only good thing about it was the ending, which was quite suspenseful. The other thing I didn't like about the movie was the stupid jingle from the commercial that ran on the TVs of the unsuspecting children. The jingle got stuck in my head and I found myself whistling the tune for several days!Don't waste your money on this one! TV stations seem to play this movie every halloween, so you can always catch it then. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
5,"Shout Factory's ""Scream""ing Halloween 3 Season of the Witch BLU","Shout Factory's Scream Factory release of Tommy Lee Wallace's Halloween III Season of the Witch blu ray is a grade A 5 star caliber superb excellent release. Finally, this great underrated seasonal classic has been upgraded and this release also includes a slew of brand new, never before seen special features including a making of documentary with director and star interviews, feature length commentary, a horror's hallowed grounds feature and much more! Tom ""Thrill Me!"" Atkins. Need i say more? Plus...you get fantastic brand newly created artwork by the amazinly talented Nathan Thomas Milliner. A MUST HAVE!!"
2,The odd one out of the Halloween series,"If your expecting Michael Myers, Donald Pleasance or Jamie Lee Curtis, then this is not the film for you. It really does not belong alongside the others and just cashes in on the fame the original achieved. As a horror film aside from the Halloween series it is quite novel with an intreresting idea for a plot, even if it was a bit slow at first."
1,Halloween 3: Nothing to do with Michael Myers,"Now..that really makes no sense, does it? If you want a break from Michael Myers, then don't watch Halloween movies (makes sense, huh?). I couldn't bare to watch the whole thing because, honestly, it sucked. It really didn't seem to have a plot at all, and it's mainly about some guy who cheats on his wife... woo hoo, not exactly Halloweeny, is it?Watch it if you really have NOTHING else to do... I have to say that it is, indeed, horrible."
1,Why did they make this film,"No Donald Pleasence,no Michael Myers,no point at all.The weakest of the series."
3,A fine change to the series.,"Director Tommy Lee Wallace, He direct it Made for t.v. Stephen King`s IT. So far is the best film from the director and the Okay sequel To Fright Night. He does homage to some of the supenseful thrillers to make Halloween 3. This film haves some scary moments like the death of a family members been murder by putting these mask is something horrfic inside these masks. This is the best moment but is actor Dan O` Herlihy gives a strong performance as the film villan. Also the actor haves been in The Last Starfighter and Robo cop 1 and 2. Dan O` Herlihy work with Nick Castle in The Last Starfighter. Nick play the shape of Micheal Myers In Halloween. Also Director Tommy Lee Wallace, He work on the Original Halloween."
1,NO MICHAEL MYERS,"I would not recommend this to fans of Michael Myers. However, if you like a good horror/sci-fi movie, this is a great movie for you.The story line was good, but i rate it 1 because I like the halloween series because of Michael Myers."
1,Dreadful! ZERO stars!!!,"This has got to be one of the most boring and tedious movies I have EVER seen, not just out of the Halloween films. The problem isn't that Michael Meyers is not in it. The plot is SO stupid, and the ""action"" doesn't even start until the last 20 minutes or so. It's not scary at all, is just boring, boring, BORING. It shouldn't even be considered a horror film. I'd put it under science-fiction. Avoid this film at all cost. It wasn't worth the money to make it, and isn't worth the money to rent."
1,BEWARE DO NOT WATCH,"Ok I liked all Halloween movies aside from this one. Why did I give it 1 star...well ""0"" is not an option. This movie has everything! Bad acting, No plot, and most importantly and very stupid ending. I'll never forget the ending of this movie... Simply because I've never been so glad to see a movie come to an end. Please do not see this movie, you've been warned."
1,"Plain DVD, Stupid Movie","This should not be named Halloween 3. They should have justleft that part off as it has NOTHING to do with the first two aboutMichael Meyers! As others have said before, it is poorly acted, no plot, and so annoying it might make you go insane! As far as DVD capabilities, there is nothing special (plain like the movie) about it. So, neither the movie nor the DVD make it a movie worth renting OR buying."
1,What Were They Thinking??????,"I hate to give any of the Halloween movies a 1 star rating but this one.... part 3 is the only one to me that deserves only 1 star. All the rest are great. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the first 2 Halloween movies at all and NO Michael Myers in this one. I think the whole storyline and plot is stupid. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this movie AND called it Halloween 3!! Thank goodness, the following 5 Halloweens follow the original!!!"
2,"Good idea, but badly executed.","It was a good idea to skip the Michael Myers storyline for a minute, but come on. Magic masks that make people's heads explode, can't they think of a better idea than that? What a waste of time. If they are going to abandon the Micheal Myers storyline, can they at least come up with a more creative storyline.P.S. the only reason that I am giving this movie two stars is because it is slightly better than sequels 4, 5, 6, and 8."
3,Different,"If you are expecting to see Michael Myers roaming around you'll be disapointed because this film takes a side-trip from the other six movies. It tells the story of this man who uncovers a plot by some mask company that is made up of people who perform witchcraft. For what it was it was good. However It shouldn't have been given the name of ""Halloween""."
1,Disappointment,This was an unfortunate inclusion in the Halloween series. I bought it knowing that it didn't follow the Halloween story line but was considered a part of it. I wanted the complete set.
2,What did I Just Watch..................?,"I actually have two views of this movie.Now me being a master of horror and all,I know that obviously Michael is dead.But what the creators of this movie didn't do is explain that they were ending the michael myers saga.Yes this movie did suck.If they were going to stop using michael they could of at least used a different title.They even refer to it as the third of the halloween series.Most of the people were Michael's fans.Somebody should smack Tommy Lee Wallace."
1,Horid and horrible sequel,"This is one of the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not even a horror movie, in the true sense. The first two Halloween movies were very good and I expected the same out of the next one when I bought it. To find out that it has nothing to do with the other movies, in fact, it shows the first Halloween movie on the television as an actual film and not something that would have happened, as a sequel should be. This is more like some cheesy, stupid, 80's sci-fi movie and should not even have the Halloween name. If you have this movie, you should burn it and if you don't, don't ever see it or even waste money on buying it (like I made the mistake of). It really sucks!"
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is unbelievably horrible! This movie dosen't even have anything to do with Michael Myers. Why would anyone keep the name ""Halloween"" and make it about some man making mask??? If you like boring, and disappointing movies this is the movie to see. It has an ok story but they could have used a different title."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen,even on dvd.The film has no michael myers,plus it is hard to watch because of the nasty gore.This movie is full of pumpkinhead people with roaches crawling out of them.Rent it,see what you think,but I hate it."
2,Halloween III: Season of the Witch,"For those of you who have not seen the end of Halloween II (1981), I will not spoil what happens if you're planning to see it. For those of you who were around in '82 and saw HIII and thought Michael was gone forever, you were wrong. Because when HIII came out, you thought they were going to move to more scares and call Michael yesterday's news. In this wasted second sequel to the Halloween series, you may be disappointed. HIII is a little predictable and somewhat a bit gruesome. On the plus side, it's my second favorite Halloween movie."
1,clearly the other reviewers saw a different film,"Are you kidding me? If I could give this film negative stars I would. I bought this because I am a huge fan of the Halloween series and I even share a tattoo with Michael Meyers, but Season of the witch is a terrible. There is little to no plot, the acting is poor at best and Michael Meyers (the Shape) only appears in one scene and that is in a TV ad for the first Halloween. This wan't Carpenter's attempt to get the series to take a new direction, this was his attempt to kill the franchise for good. Halloween 3: Season of the witch has nothing to do with the rest of the series and sadly the Halloween name is the only reason to even give this pile of $#!% a glance. and after that glance never look at it or admit that it even exists."
1,WHAT THE HELL WHERE THEY THINKING,"(...) THIS WANNABE MOVIE IS A DISCRACE TO THE ALL TIME SLASHER SERIES.OK GET THIS, THIS IS A HALLOWEEN MOVIE, YOUR THINKING COOL, MICHAEL MYERS KILLING AND THE WHOLE NINE YARDS BUT, NO YOU GET NOTHING A BUNCH OF HOMOS JUMPING AROUNG IN MASKS, THATS IT NO MICHAEL MYERS NO PLOT, NO NOTHING, NOT EVEN FAMILIAR CHARACTERS. THIS MOVIE IS A ALL TIME SUCK MOVIE."
2,Gruesome...,"Well, you won't see Michael Myers in this sequel, but it's still watchable.An evil maker somewhere in Northern California provides young children with devilishly made pumpkin masks... need I say more."
1,"GOD,THIS MOVIE WAS SO STUPID","i bought this movie before i rented it thinking it would have michael myers but after i watched it,i felt like killing myself for even RENTING it! this movie has NO michael myers!it doesnt even have anything to do with any of the halloweens! they really shouldnt of made this movie.do not waste your money or your time watching this movie.skip it"
1,Halloween 3 is a classic... piece of Garbage!!!!,"Halloween 3 is the worst horror flick ever made, I would rather eat Guano while sitting on thumbtacks and drinking bile while watching Leprechaun in Space, than watch this 98 minute slaughter of the prestigous Halloween series. What was John Carpenter smoking when he came up with the worst possible idea in the history of horror films. If you purchase this film then you have just donated your hard earned money to foundation of crappy movies! Remember, Have a Happy Halloween From Silver Shamrock!!!!!"
1,Why??,"... As a horror movie buff, I can honestly say that this is about as bad as it gets. There is absolutely no entertaining value whatsoever to this garbage."
2,Intriguing but very disorganized,"I experienced this book in audio format and had quite a bit of difficulty following any sort of logical thread; so much so that I wondered about the viability of audio (something I've only recently started dealing with). It was therefore comforting to see so many other reviewers commenting on disorganization. Apparently, it's the work itself, not the format.That's a shame. The topic is a fascinating one. I wish it had been more cogently presented. At this point in time, I would say Jared Diamond is still the author to read if you are interested in this field. It appears that 1491 aspires to stand next to it, and might have succeeded with better editing. But as it stands now, it doesn't work."
3,Decent Read at Bedtime,"I enjoyed the book, but quite often I found that the book was best for helping me fall asleep. Much of what is written is repetitive - in that the ""histories"" are similar. Some of the book is too detailed - who did what to whom. The book felt at times, disjointed. I felt as if the author bounced around from here to there with no good reason (was the author bored?). I think the author got hung up on the theories/suppositions that populations were much greater and that more died of disease than history books admit to. The points made are fine, mostly believable, probably true to some extent, but once the point is made, redundant.I did learn some things that were new to me. I will read the subsequent book to see how the story ""ends.""Reading this on a Kindle is not the easiest. Kindle does not make it easy to bounce around from reference to reference to appendices an back. Also, the Kindle version of this book had no page numbers."
5,Amazing,"This is one of those books that will leave you amazed at what you didn't know. Life on our continent before Columbus was so much more than I had ever realized before books like Mann's and Jarrod Diamond's work.Most library's carry this one, but it would make an excellent gift for the history geek in your family."
4,Great insight,"This book covers a topic that is either not covered well by our educational system or is misrepresented. For those of you that want to understand what life in the Americas was like before Europeans, you will find this book an eye opener."
3,ehh?,"This book is just ok. After reading some of the reviews I thought it would be this incredible book, but I'd liken it to more of an ok-written book about an amazing subject matter."
1,Politically correct speculation,"Pre-Columbian Indian societies were, for the most part, made up of stone-age hunter gatherers. The few who made it to urban God-king organizations, Aztecs, Incas, were interesting but bizarre. Sacrificing 16,0000 humans at a religious ceremony by cutting out their beating hearts and feasting on their bodies is more than just a curiosity. This book is just another in a long line of guilt-ridden nonsense(see Diamond and his germs). Instead read Thomas Sowell on Conquests for a balanced view."
4,A piece of Historical REALITY!,"Critics can, ""shoot thier cannons from a canoe""! Fact is, this book comes closer to anything most U.S. High Schools have taught and still teach! Yes, sad and condecending to ""Native Americans""! A book that's fascinating and yet not so detailed as to bore the general reader. Thanks Charles;Judging by many of the artifacts found throughout North and South America, Copper, Stone spearpoints, (Hixton solicified sandstone), Effigy Mounds, Red Ocher sand,Cahokia, Aztalan, to the evidence of wide spread trading, etc etc. I myself always knew. If someone would have ""parachuted"" and landed in my area of where I live (Central Wisconsin), 2000 yrs. ago. That ""someone"" would have been seen. The only thing that gets me wondering is. Why didn't the population from a metallargical point of view, advance further. They went from stone to copper and back to stone again.......?"
4,The History Most of Us Never Learned,"This ambitious book gives details about the 'new world' before the coming of the Europeans. Demonstrating that the 'new world' may have indeed been older than the 'old world' of Europe, the book takes the reader on a tour of civilizations in North and South America, raises issues about the origins of the inhabitants (how did they get here and when), and presents information about the probable diseases brought by Europeans that resulted in the death of millions of Indians--and the destruction of their cities and ways of life."
2,Revisionism at Its Best,"Mann's book, while entertaining, is nothing more than speculative revisionism. The book does not read very easily because it jumps around from one topic to the next without warning frequently. Mann's intentions may have been good, but it doesn't excuse the fact that you can't rewrite history simply to promote an idealistic view of native cultures based on circumstantial evidence. He offers no hard facts to promote his patronizing image of Native American civilizations prior to Europeanization. Nonetheless I enjoyed the book because it does offer some new or ""fresh"" perspectives into Native American cultures prior to (but mainly after) 1492, but I treated it more as fictional entertainment rather than an authentic historical account."
2,"A good summary of new thinking on pre-European Americas, BUT...","As many reviewers have said, this book does a good job of presenting modern thinking on the state of the Americas before European ""invasion"". However, I find it to be a thinly disguised anti-wilderness polemic fitting in nicely with the current Republican movement against wild lands preservation, the Endangered Species Act, and other environmental efforts reversed during the last 6 years. The political undertones make it hard to accept much of the undoubtedly true recent anthropologic and archeologic work presented and ably discussed."
4,Good History Lesson,"This book really teaches you some things you may not have learned while you where in high school, or maybe even in college especially if you are older than the age of 25-30. Some of the lessons taught are of finding information that some of the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations wher actually quite large and elaborate. Some had flowing water and others where the size of if not larger than Paris, France at the same time. If you enjoy history you will enjoy this book, if you are not into history this book is probably not for you."
5,astounding and engaging,"This book is full of astounding information. Whereas some of the information is controversial, at least it is being brought to light. I am amazed that so much archaeology has been hidden for so long. Much of the information that you will read here will slowly make its way into mainstream education. For starters I have only once before heard of the possibility of an Amazonian civilization. Also too, i never thought that the history of the American Indians really rang true. Were not these people as smart as Europeans? Wouldn't this intelligence complicate their lives too? As it turns out, they were very complex neither brutish nor naive simpletons. They weren't noble savages.....they were (are) people, with all the potentials for greatness and evil.... just like Europeans."
1,"Disorganized, semi-coherent, useful insights carefully obscured","Mann offers some fresh insights, some or all may be valid; however, the wandering style and lack of scholarly approach makes the book next to useless for one wanting to understand pre-Columbus America."
3,"""1491"" Falls Short of Ex cellence","Perhaps in contrast to the ""rave"" reviews for this book, I found this a hodge-podge compendium of information already explored by historians and archaeologists in a much more comprehensive form. As to the title, ""1491,"" it is eye-catching, but misleading, particularly since the author's first anecdotal reference is to a seventeenth-century occurrence at Plymouth Rock. Extensive time is spent on the results of post-Columbian contact (and even that falls short). Additionally, I found gaping holes in the description of aboriginal populations in North America. What happened to the Ancient Puebloans, the many societies along the Northwest coast, the California inhabitants, etc.?"
5,Classic update of the Sherlock saga from the 40s,Rathbone as Holmes overacts like crazy to the point of camp.Watson as the buffoon is entertaining.The best kind of schlock.
2,"Straitforward, trivial variation on the theme of Psycho","This unbelievably boring, uninventive thriller that borrows too much from Hitchcock's Psycho (shower murders, double identity of the killer, death of the main heroine, etc.) is quite possibly Brian De Palma's worst movie that I have seen so far."
2,Disappointing Finale to Holmes Series,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce receive a desultory sendoff in their final Sherlock Holmes entry for Universal. Despite the efforts of director Roy William Neill and a good supporting cast, ""Dressed to Kill"" (1946) feels like a ""B movie"" throwaway with its flat scripting and recycled Frank Skinner music from ""Son of Frankenstein."" A dull end to a memorable series."
5,DePalma's Best,"Hold tight. The terrifying and notorious elevator scene would be enough to recommend this gripping thriller - and that's only the beginning! Hitchcock rip-off? Hardly (if anything, it owes something to Bunuel). If you were frightened by ""Scream,"" that's kid-stuff compared to this classic shocker."
5,Great stuff!!,I was hesitant to use Hoppe's Elite after being satisfied with Hoppe's #9. But Elite works BETTER without the nasty stink and complaints from the wife. I'm very satisfied with the performance of Hoppe's Elite and it will replace Hoppes #9 in my cleaning equipment.
5,Excelent idea and lots of fun!,"Hey This product is now available in the united states. It was originally made in england. that is where I got mine. It is awesome and it works fairly well. I recomend staying still before you take a shot. It helps if you dont stand so close to the base. The base acts like a sonar and will detect a straight hit, a slice or a hook. You can change the club size only in the software. It is a little silly to put with a wedge but hey its a toy! Was a great holiday gift and everyone wanted to play including grandma. I hope they make more of these. cheaper than Wii!"
3,Bought for father-in-law; he liked it but...,"We bought this for my 62 year old father in law, who can't get out and golf as much as he used to. He liked it for the great motion sensor and because he can use a real club, but the graphics are so limitted that after using this game, he wants a Wii instead. So for the price we paid, yes, good product... But may leave you wanting more..."
2,Not happy,I bought this gilmour 572tfr nozzle and then couldn't buy the 09qcf adapter to go with it that I nead to fit up to my spraters. not happy at all!!!!
3,"not made in USA, made in china","Ideal for commercial or industrial useInsulated molded grip for spraying hot or cold waterMale hose threaded front for attaching accessoriesBrass head insert for maximum resistance to extremely hot waterMade in USAMine says made in CHINA, average quality, not worth 8.00 though."
2,"Call Me Insane, but I Wasn't Feelin' This","My taste in dance music is as diverse as anyone else's. I really dig soulful house, trance, two-step, and drum and bass. MoS has been one of the few labels that has consistently steered me in the right direction in terms of good dance music, but their winning streak ends here. I really liked the 2002 Ibiza guide, but this mix by Judge Jules didn't do it for me. We get nondescript, hyperactive trance numbers that start off promisingly but don't take off well. It would have been nice if we got more vocals and more variety, but I guess that doesn't really matter if this is blasting while you're at the club severely intoxicated. I'm actually VERY glad I got this used because if I paid the full import price, I would not have been a happy camper. While I'm sure this will appeal to some, this guide to Ibiza was a disappointment."
1,don't underestimate your dog's chewing power,"I purchased a ""Wolf"" size, and it turns out that I should have just flushed some cash down the toilet.Within FIVE minutes, the bone's end was chewed clean off. I permitted my 35 pound one year old dog to continue to chew supervised, however it was for naught: pieces were routinely chewed off; what was left of the bone and those removed pieces have subsequently been trashed.Again, make sure of your sizing selection if you're making a Rhino Bone purchase."
5,A delightful read with a lesson within,"The ""Little Rabbit"" series of books are wonderful for preschoolers and early readers. The illustrations are gorgeous and detailed, the text is simple and easy to read, perfect for early readers and also for reading aloud.In this book, Little Rabbit celebrates his birthday with his family - they all take a trip to Rabbit World, a huge amusement park. Little Rabbit exhibits the typical characteristic of a little child who is getting older - fierce independence! He goes about on his own, refusing to listen to his parents' advice to stay close in case he gets lost, and lo and behold, that is exactly what happens to him!There is a good lesson to be learnt in this story - little ones will learn caution and the importance of listening to their elders and paying attention. But the lesson is presented in a fun way with Little Rabbit's antics eliciting much laughs.All in all, this is a wonderful book to be shared with preschoolers and beginner readers."
1,NOT in 3D,"just a little heads up for everybody, despite the tittle and amazon stating that this is a 3D version of the film, it is NOT. it is nether anaglyph nore the old Field Sequential active shutter 3D,technically this is false advertisement... so BUYER BEWARE!!and I gave 1 star for this reason."
1,NO 3-D,"As a collector of 3-D movies that really work, this one is a total rip off!! Do not waste your time or money if you expect a 3-D experience. Movie was a bit out of focus, no viewing glasses included what so ever, and did not even work with any of the many different types of 3-D glasses that I own. Was not even worth the bother of returning it, so I threw it in the trash, do not believe everything you read! This DVD was totally misleading in its description.BEWARE!!!"
3,Didn't ring true,The book was quite interesting but it just didn't ring true. It was I think supposed to be a true story but I'm not sure I'm convinced that it was.
4,"I liked the book, but...","I liked the book but the portions about The Program went on a bit long. I would have liked to have read more about what all went on after The Program. Her love for David was pure and real throughout the book, yet she waited until the Epilogue to tell the readers what happened to him. At that point, I felt robbed. Also, Julia's hatred for her family seemed untrue after you read that she graduated from college; college (at her parents' alma mater) that was paid by her parents. I found that obscene. Otherwise, it was a good trip down memory lane in the early-mid-1980's in Central Indiana for me. She painted Central Indiana during that time vividly."
3,Great Story - Horrible Writing,"This is one of those great ""Truth is stranger than fiction books."" It's a very candid exposure of those who misuse religion and who can't seem to apply their beliefs to everyday life, for those who need it most. The characterizations are great. The story is engrossing. It is a story almost too bizarre to be believed except for the fact that it is presented in a way that really helps you believe.That being said, I was absolutely disgusted with the horrible grammar in the book. How can Julia Scheers be a professional writer and still write with such shoddy usage? I don't know who is to blame: Scheers or the editors who neglected to correct the numerous mistakes. How can a college-educated journalist not know the difference between ""lie"" and ""lay""? After the 50th time I read the words ""lay down"" in the book I threw it across the room in frustration. Seriously. Who writes like this and gets published?"
1,"Another ""million little pieces""","Anyone who's been to Lafayette, IN knows this story streches the truth....a lot! In one part, the author claims that the students at Harrison High School have ""probably never seen a real live black person before."" (pg 6). Really? Because I know some African Americans who have graduated from Harrison!! I'm not saying Lafayette is not over 1/2 white (it is) but Scheeres should stick to fiction, because this book can hardly be called a ""memoir"".It's another 'million little pieces', a ""memoir"" that's 'spiced up' with fiction to sell more books."
3,Some Good Drama Some Overdone,"Shine is a movie that definitely took a great deal of thought and planning. The premise is the realtionship of a classical piano playing son prodigy with his passionate yet abusive father. When the father refuses to allow his son to pursue his talents in London, our hero runs away to rebel against his father.Later on he suffers a nervous breakdown and stammers terribly throughout the course of his adult life. He finds a love interest and is able to find eventual success in his musical pursuits.There is some excellent cinematography particularly of the sheer expression of our hero's piano playing ability. Somehow the repetitive scenes of our hero standing in the rain or throwing his eye glasses off gets a bit wearisome. Nonetheless, our hero perserveres in the end so the sense of triumph does extend this rating to about 3 1/2 stars."
2,good movie but inaccurate,Shine is an good movie in some sense with obviously some touching moments. But the biggest problem is the potrayal of the pianist is not true. So even though the movie based on real life character but for most part especially the pianist talent is overrated or exagerated in the movie. I've seen the way he's playing in real life concert and it's so dissapointing. It's like watching a freak show. You expected a great pianist. But you saw an average talented pianist who happened to have some pshycological problem because of his childhood experiences. That makes me dissapointed with the movie.
2,Well....,"No. This film is not a triumph of the human spirit against adversity. Emotionally disturbed father does bad job of raising schizoid son with music talent. The end. You could ""enjoy"" the same character development by hanging out in an inner city bus terminal late at night and striking up a conversation with the people who approach you for spare change. So what was good? Several truly beautiful performances of Rachmaninov's compositions."
3,OK movie to see the struggles to become a world class pianist,This movie would have been more enjoyable if we had subtitles available for it. My wife and I were struggling to try to understand what the actors were saying. Amazon should offer subtitles for all of it movies.
3,An odd story,"This is based on the life of David Helfgott, an Australian piano prodigy who escaped the stifling influence of his strange, domineering father to attend the Royal College of Music in London. Apparently he was always eccentric, but his career was cut short by a mysterious seizure that turned him into a chain-smoking, shuffling, manic-mumbling, confused person who spent years institutionalized. Eventually he wandered into a piano bar and was re-discovered."
3,Self tanning towel review,"These towels I didn't find as good as the original Tan Towel; but for a quick touch up, they are okay. I'm of asian decent and the Comodynes kind of came up a bit on the orange side for me and there was streaking. Self tanning lotions/towels will have different affects on everyone. The color depends on your skin type and natural color. Make sure you apply to dry, clean, exfoliated skin."
5,Six Stars,"What a lovely book! On returning from my first trip to Israel not long ago, friends and colleagues were stunned at how totally I -- a liberal secular non-Jew -- had fallen for Israel, and especially for the Israeli people. No doubt I sounded goofily infatuated trying to explain the resilience, toughness, crusty directness, the kindness, the wit, the incredible Israeli smile -- see, there I go again.Well, they're each getting this book for the next birthday, because Donna Rosenthal so entertainingly illustrates and elaborates all that I was trying to get across, and more. She shines a gentle but penetrating light on the contemporary Israeli culture and people from inside out.This is a wonderfully written book, intricately but smoothly woven from anecdotes, interviews, vignettes, histories, and possible futures; it is a pleasure to read. Most highly recommended!"
4,Huge tent but doesn't connect to tunnel,"We bought this to go with a pacific tent play tunnel thinking it would connect with the Velcro flap on the tunnel. It doesn't! And the tent is much larger than anticipated, even after reading the measurements. My one year old daughter still loves to play in it but it would be better if the tunnel was connected."
5,Goodbye Flatland,"Another amazing release by a talented band. These guys never cease to amaze me with their lyrics, melodies, and sounds. Ok, so they are one of my favorites, but if you have other 54-40 CD's, then you'll know what I mean. I wonder why these guys aren't giants in the industry, but then again, I like them the way they are. This CD features such gems as Giants, Ride, and Seventeen On. Oh ya, Animal In Pain, is a riot! With so much intellegint rock packed into one CD, I feel I've stolen something. Keep up the good work guys!"
1,Waste of money,"I ordered this product to replace a phone my daughter broke.. when it arrived it was blue.. which I needed a phone so I didn't care.. and then I turned it on and found that is a Motorola China.. which could not be activated where I live.. and was programed to work in chinese. so I had to send it back.. I paid 12 dollars to send it back and J&R ( the comapany in NY where the phone was shipped from) would not give me a full refund.. and then it is only a store credit.. in which, I would never buy anything from there again to start with. very very dissatisfied"
2,"Great phone, except for the reception","I think this is a great phone. It's pretty neat. But it is very much a ""made in China"" phone,m so the quality seems a little poor. But the only that I couldn't stand was the poor reception it has. Sometimes, it goes into ""emergency call"" only mode because it can't pickup my provider (AT&T) which I usually have great signal in my area."
3,"students,sex and acting","New Love in TokyoTwo girls who are working in the sex-business are having fun with there job and with there acting class.One is a dominatrix.You could see very well what she is doing with a Yakuza boss and some other guy who is thought a lesson.At the same time(in the movie) they are having fun with some guys they are dating.I must say the story is part of there(real) live,so don't expect to much action(like in movie-action)but rather pleasant and interresting moments with a lot of laughter.During the film there is also a lot of nude pictures of the two main actresses .Suzuki sawa is very beautiful who also won an aword for this movie."
2,Not my cup of tea,For some reason this CD just sounded really corney to me. I was really dissapointed. Your opinion may differ but I would recommend that if you are looking for a classical Zeppelin CD you get Kashmir instead. It is cheaper and shines a new light on some awsome songs rather than butchering them.
4,Wonderfully fasinating!,"I thought The History of Mankind was fasinating. I think this is a good book for anyone learning about World History. It is a advanced, but well paced, so an Elementary student, reading carefully could read it as well as a Junior High or High School student."
1,Eurocentrist and waaayyyyy out of date,"Calling this a history of ""mankind"" was meant, tongue-in-cheek, as a joke, right? Any student of history perusing the Table of Content of this title would know how misappropriately titled and conceived this book was.That said, there are two principal criticisms one can level at it: first, who pens works on ""mankind"" anymore? -- that is, who still thinks that a book that leaves half of the human race out of its title and its content is in any sense comprehensive? The second, and even more serious, is, why write a history of Europe and call it a history of ""mankind""? Why not just call it what it is? A History Europeans and leave it for others to write big history."
1,Just-in-time printing gone very wrong,This book is no longer being printed the old-fashioned way. This version is now a just-in-time book. Which means ALL THE ILLUSTRATIONS ARE MISSING. Even the ones that are necessary for the text to make sense. This version of this book is a total rip off. Some one got really sloppy and didn't deliver a complete file for printing. I recommend buying a used version of this book.
2,No Editing,I just bought this book to use as a portion of our homeschool history curricullum. However this versionof the book (ISBN-13: 978-1153721998) also has little or no editing. There are whole sentences missing and some sentences stop mid line then continued on the next line. We can't make sense of it so I have purchaed an original text with illustrations. Hopefully it won't contain these errors and I can write an actual review on the material in the book.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The rack u get is not the one in the picture. The pic on the box is the same as the on online however what is in the box is WAY different. The joint that connects the piece that attaches to the hitch; to the long vertical piece is not like the pic at ALL. The joint makes the unit weak and very unstable. Unusable!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS RACK. TRUST ME. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.
5,Life Changing,"I read this book about 20 years ago, and it got me thinking more and more about religion. I can't say that I was ever a ""religious person"", just that I needed to define what it is and how it fit in my life. This book had me questioning the bible, and that led to me questioning religion as a whole. I know this was not the intent of Mr. Paine, but I am beholding to him because his words began to open my eyes to the truth. I am proud to be an atheist."
1,Where are the reviews?,"This is the place for book reviews-- Not religious or non-religious opinion airing. Stick to the books, not Christian bashing, please."
5,Paine a great thinker,"Paine was a revolutionary thinker, one of the most expanded minds of his time. The Age of Reason is a monument to freethought - not atheism - but freethought. Paine was not an atheist, but a deist, and this book goes miles towards freeing people who want to hold on to God-belief while rejecting constricting, human religion. I myself am an atheist and don't agree with him on deism, but for so many mystics and agnostic theists today who seek another way to harmonize philosophical God-belief and intelligence, this is THE book to have. The points that are made are keenly insightful. This work paved the road for so many freethinkers to travel. This book is a classic.(JH)www.ministerturnsatheist.org"
4,Big Hit in PRC,"We watched this movie while travelling in the PRC. Not only did we enjoy the movie, but the people in the lounge where we watched it made the experience one of our travel favourites. The main character is something like the Wyatt Earp of China. Fine piece of Kung Fu."
4,"great collection, but I might have got a bad CD","This is a really nice selection of bossa nova music, but my CD only had 20 tracks, despite being labeled as having 22. Did this happen to anybody else? Still, it's 20 tracks of really nice music, so I can't get too upset."
5,Great introduction to bossa nova,"This great introduction to Bossa Nova couldn't be a better value-for-money. Sampling from each of the major trends in the genre, _Bossa Nova Brasil_ will turn the mildest curiosity in the rhythms into a genuine interest. This is great I-just-got-off-work-and-I've-got-a-date-in-an-hour music. Put it on in your car to unwind and enjoy the ride. Or throw open your windows on a spring day and celebrate the change of seasons. Or share it with someone you love to dance embarrassingly unwell with. Whatever you do, though, give bossa nova a try, and trust that this collection will be an excellent way to start."
4,"Like A Beautiful Rose, Thorns and All","Richard Chachere's Jungian Reflections on the film, American Beauty, is the deeply personal conversation you never had with your best friend or your mentor about certain universally-shared fears and fantasies you mistakenly believe are yours alone. It is a touchstone of familiar and provocative images from film, literature and the arts that symbolize the dysfunction in our relationships. It is about looking hard at one's own complexes. In the end, and perhaps most importantly, it is about the truly beautiful in life and about the heroic but often undeveloped quality of the human psyche. A must read for anyone at work (and at play) in the psychic garden of perfect roses and painful thorns."
1,Version in photo is NOT what is sent,"I ordered this cup, but received the new 'Twist & Click' version of the princess cup that is white or beige with the clear outer shell, and the silver stripe at the top of the cup. They do not appear to have the version in the photo."
1,A terrible book,"This is supposed to be a ""For Dummies"" book, but it is long winded and full of unnecessary ""filler"". Due to the length and unnecessary content, it is extremely difficult to find the pertinent information in the book. The author has taken a subject that could have been written in a fifth the number of pages, and over complicated it. The length and structure of this book is such that it makes it impractical to derive the required knowledge from it. Do not waste your money, and more importantly, your time on this book."
5,Love All X Files.,I live Gillian Anderson and I am a big fan of the 90's Xfiles so if you like her and the X Files great movie.
3,"Not as good as the others, but still a good read","The next book in the Young Wizards series dips somewhat below the quality of the two previous novels. Duane treads far into the ""rational fantasy"" territory of Madeline L'Engle here; in fact, the book in places seems to be a direct homage to _A Wrinkle in Time_ with its rapid planet-hopping and planets based on philosophy. I'm tempted to call this science fiction or at least science fantasy.In a major shift, the hero of the story is Nita's little sister, Dairine, who has a knack for computer wizardry. The humor that was subtle in the previos novel, _Deep Wizardry_, returns in full force here for the first half-Dairine makes for a very humorous heroine. But toward the end the book bogs down in its own half-explained philosophy. This confusing finale keeps the book from obtaining the thrilling heights of the first two."
2,A bad ending,"I really liked the first two wizardry books, so this one was a bad disappointment. The fanasty world of the first two seemed to have turned into a science fiction universe which was boring and unimaginative. The story was hard to follow and it was very annoying having Dairine as the main character as I never liked her and didn't want her to become a wizard. Rather then this bad end to a good trilogy I would prefer to think of So You Want to Be a Wizard and Deep Wizardry as a book and its sequel. The only reason I finished this book is because I wanted to read the whole trilogy-otherwise, it just wasn't intresting."
5,great book,"this series is reall good and great fun, rather on the lines of harry potter...I highly recomend, NOT just for kids."
1,"Please guys, you can't take this seriously","To understand intelligent design you have to understand the political and psychological position that the United States is at. ""Intelligent Design"" and ""Christian Science"" are concepts needed to create the Orwellian Society that the US establishment needs to propagate their position as a superpower.Guys, open your eyes, you're being lied to. How come you're the only ones not seeing it?"
2,Could be better!,"The reader of this story was hard to follow because there was no difference in the voice of each charater. I found this hard to listen to and understand, sorry!"
3,"I Love It, but...","Admission: I am a DIE HARD Brian Wilson fan, and I love the concept of this album. That said, I'm not particularly crazy about most of it. For me, the absolute highlight is ""Your Imagination"" (5 stars); it's very creative and brings a different/fresh light to a great tune. Although I'm not as crazy about it, ""Help Me, Rhonda"" also sheds new light on a great tune - I give him creativity points. Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the tunes are nicely done re-makes, with little to add. Granted, the original versions of these songs were so well produced, it's hard to find new things to say. If you like these artists and you would like to hear their voices singing Brian's tunes, you will love this. If you are expecting imaginative takes on his tunes, you will be largely disappointed. I personally think this would have made a better single-CD set. 'Don't mean to be sour (I'm not), 'just want you to know what you're getting."
4,Great toy for toddlers,I have bought this tunnel for my three children. They seem to enjoy this toy very well. One bad thing about the toys is that it seems to be to small for all three to climb thru. This item is very durable and easy to fold and store away.
4,Parachute,Happy with purchase. I bought it for 3 families with young children and I believe they are all enjoying them.
5,Fun Fun Fun,Great play experience for small children. My grand kids loved it and get it out for parties and play time.
2,It Doesn't Hold Any Air,This play parachute holds less air than a plain old bed sheet. We spent an extra 10 bucks on a real Gymboree play parachute from eBay with much more fun results.
5,Fun for all!,"Fun for all - The local Gymboree closed, so we have ""Gymboree"" time in our own home now.Even our dog gets in on the fun ans still not rips in the fabric! :)"
4,It's Duane... but Lacking.,"I read the first three in this set seven years ago and I cried. I loved her wizards and hoped desperately for more. When ""Book of Night with Moon"" came out I eagerly ate it up and looked for more -- finally stumbling across book five. But I'm sorry, folks... I found this one lacking. It's like comparing ""Dragonquest"" to ""The Masterharper of Pern"". They're both GREAT, but one's certainly better. Even so, I can't wait for the next in the set."
5,Starlight and Time Review,Thanks for the great information in starlight and time. This is great for conversing with evolutionists.Errick
4,audio for Polar Express,My son is thoroughly enjoying this audio version of the music found in the movie.
4,Incredible Soundtrack but too many old songs in it,"I must say Polar Express was indeed a most wondrous movie. After watching the movie, I went to get the soundtrack the next day because the music was absolutely breathtaking. What especially stands out is ""When Christmas Comes To Town"", featuring a wonderful duet by 2 kids with voices that are very sweet. This song captures the mood of the movie and is simply incredible. ""Believe"" sung by Josh Groban is another marvellous song and I simply love it.My complaint though, is that on this cd, there are only 8 tracks which were composed for this movie. The other tracks are all from long ago and just doesn't make the cd worth it. The score by Alan Silvestri is wonderful but with the other half of the cd being old songs, I'm not sure if it is worth the price. But if you like Christmas music and like to have the feeling of Christmas, this is certainly the cd for you"
5,Awesome Item!,"This is a fast shipper and item was exactly as described. Would recommend this item, love the extra songs. Thanks"
4,"Keurig Green Mountain coffee, Nantucket Blend",A very nice coffee; not overly strong and with nice flavor. The Green Mountain line of coffees are a good choice for the Keurig System.
5,eclectic pop,"The Mints have delivered consistently good, catchy, odd, orchestral pop on their last two albums. This album is even better than the previous two. They've been compared to the Kinks, the Flaming Lips... forget those comparisons. The Starlight Mints are unlike any other band I've heard. You need to give them a listen. Their songs are quirky, upbeat, fun, and well-written. The arrangements are smart and catchy. A wide range of instruments and odd-ball sounds are combined with reckless abandon... and it sounds really good. Give them a listen. They'll rock your world. In a weird sort of way."
3,VHS transfer quality.,"Since there wasn't any customer reviews for this product, I thought I'll put my two cents worth in. My big disappointment is that the video quality is straight from vhs transfer. You are better off if you have the vhs version of this movie (much better picture and not as dark). I hope some day they will release a better quality of this film on dvd."
4,Delightful,"This is one of those eclectic foreign films that are just delightful. A reverse of the usual fairy tale, the bear has been turned into a human by a wicked wizard. He can only be turned back if a princess falls in love with him and kisses him. It's zany, but quite original. Beware though, there's an intermission where they play the credits. IT IS NOT YET OVER! It's just intermission."
4,Woderful and memorable.,"I watched this series when I was ten years old. I was astounded by the cinematography. It might have not been as advanced as today's movies but, it was worth the shot. You certainly will need patience to watch the movie but if you are a lover of the series, you can let your mind roam free. During turbulent times in my life in Nigeria, it provided me with a way of escape. I loved the theme song and I loved Aslan. He was stern with the girl because she needed to know the gravity of her situation."
4,Nice for any fan of The Cure,I was hoping Songwords would have information from Robert Smith on what inspired his songs and their meaning etc. - but the book simply lists lyrics to their songs - which is fine and still a neat thing to have.
4,kids love it,"We purchased this as a christmas present for our one year old. He loves it. His much older brother enjoys playing in it too. It seems rather sturdy, you do need a bit of space to use it. Taking the the time to bundle it to put it away can be a hassle. Bought it so we could buy a tent at later time."
5,Great Agility Starter Tunnel,"I bought this for a puppy, but would recommend it for children as well. Nice solid construction, good quality fabric. The peep holes of mesh fabric are nice for little one's security. The steel rims are not well padded however and could really hurt one's knees."
4,good for the purpose,"Bought this for my son to wear to swim class partly because he shivers all the time. While it fits well and he loves to run around in it, the shivering didn't really stop."
5,Nothing to worry about!,"NANA MOUSKOURI has nothing to worry about, as this project is one of her best in English. Great!"
1,piece of crap,worst movie ever. why you may ask well lets think. first it had no historical content. if you can point out where a gladiator kills an emperor and make rome a republic i will give you a million dollars. second the acting was horible. none of the actors showed any of the characters emotions except for comodus. and third the effects were worse than the old godzilla movies(which werent that bad). i could make a better coloseum out of clay. well there ya go. gladiator is the worst movie in existance.
4,Great Extra Footage,"Great purchase for the AMAZON PRICE!!,, It was like watching the movie again with all the extra parts that the original film didnt have."
5,A masterpiece. Human spirit triumphs over imperial power!,"Russel Crowe did an excellent job in this film playing the betrayed general who was sent into the gladiator pits. If you have not seen it, beg borrow or steal it if you have to. It is a must see for any movie fan. Once you have seen it you will want to own it. I have seen it four times and am not planning on stopping there!"
1,Bad picture quality,"Very bad Picture Quality!I was excited to buy this blu ray, but then I started looking at the reviews. The picture has been treated with EE (edge enhancement), (DNR) digital noise reduction, and other filters which make the picture quality much worse than it should be. Looking at screen captures, this is very obvious. One such glaring errors is a large numbers of arrows are erased from a shot because of what is believed to be a scratch removal filter. I await a good transfer and will most likely buy that day one."
4,How to definitively know you got the remastered version,"Pay very careful attention when trying to determine which disc you actually received from Amazon. There's conflicting information on the internet as far as the telltale signs of the remastered disc versus the original crappy transfer. For example, most people tell you the packaging for the new version has a yellow UPC....not always true. Other people tell you the copyright on the back bottom right of the box says 2010 DW Studios LLC instead of the original which says 2009, also not always true.It seems the only definitive way to tell if you have the new version is to look at the innermost rings on the underside of Disc One itself. Hold it up to the light, and at the end of a string of letters and numbers, you should see ""B1R2"". If you have anything else (i.e. B1R1), you have the original version and NOT the remastered one!If so, exchange it promptly."
5,Another Ridley Scott Classic,"Gladiator is right up there with BladeRunner, Alien, Conquest of Paradise and Legend as Ridley Scott's best. The music combination of Lisa Gerrard (formerly - Dead Can Dance) and Hans Zimmer follow in the tradition of great musical scores of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. It's a beautiful film; I saw it 4 times at the Theater. Can't wait too get the DVD !"
5,Colosseum.,There was a heavy atomosphere in this movie. It made me concentrate on the movie and I was tired after seeing it.The scene of this movie is in ancient Roma. Especially in Colosseum where many gladiator are fighting for their own freedom.I enjoyed this movie a lot. Probably you will enjoy too. Thank you.
5,A GENERAL RETURNS.,if you like russell crowe this is probally his finest movie to date. place yourself as a general in the roman empire leading thousands of soldiers into battle then be striken of your honor and sentenced to die by the emperior's command. see how the general regains his past glory and the loyalty of his fellow soldiers.
2,WARNING: This film is NOT historically accurate,"My son was bored in his history class, so I told him to toss aside those stupid books and watch GLADIATOR with us instead! This movie looked so authentic that I had to assume it is historically accurate, and told little Steven not to bother studying anything other than this film for his test on the Romans, or whatever. Much to my surprise, my poor Steven received a D-! I think it is irresponsible for the film industry to tout this film as a complete and accurate history of Rome when, in fact, it may be incomplete. Before you buy this to help you son get out of reading those silly books for history class, look into whether it is historically accurate or not. I have not read much about the Romans. I do not like to read much of anything for that matter, but it sure seemed o.k. to me..."
2,Ripoff,"*Gladiator (R)- Ridley Scott is a favourite director of mine and I waited anxiously for this. While I was never bored during the films lengthy running time (even when so much of the time is spent fawning over unimpressive CGI shots of the Coliseum), I was absolutely enraged that the film is basically a remake of The Fall of the Roman Empire and the screenwriter's of that far superior film are not even acknowledged. If you want a roman epic, rent Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Robe, Fall of the... or countless others. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant."
2,I couldn't get into this one,"This movie didn't do anything for me. I thought the acting was 'wooden' and the plot simplistic. I do enjoy action movies, but this one didn't fit into that category imho. I did like a few of the fight scenes, but they weren't enought to win me over."
2,Overrated,"This movie has many inaccuracies (see: movie-mistakes.com) and a weak plot, definately no epic or contender for older 'sword and sandal' films. This one has it's moments, some good dialogue, the battle scenes are very engaging, but do not show what is actually happening in them, though I'm sure people who worked on the film know. I can't believe so many people like this movie. It is too long and boring. Watch TLC and A&E instead."
4,Awesome movie almost amazing picture,"Awesome movie, story, acting, etc. The blu ray quality was good, but not blown away 5 stars great. I, too, could see the arrows in the beginning, plus different markings on the packaging so i'm assured it is the remastered version."
1,Studio Rip-off,"I am too annoyed to bother describing just how bad this disc is. The other one star raters hit the mark perfectly. Hopefully, few people will buy it after reading the reviews and the company will be forced to release a proper Blu-Ray transfer soon. I love this movie and have been waiting since I got a Blu-Ray player for it to be released. They should be ashamed to accept money for this disaster. What an insult."
1,"Poor, poor transfer","Why pay money for a poor transfer? Wait until the re-release!This sort of studio avarice is akin to that of the distributors of Lord of the Rings, who will release a Blu-ray in the shorter thetrical version in April, only to snatch more of your money by releasing the longer definitive version within the next 12 months thereafter."
1,no better than DVD,"instead of taking their time and doing the job right.. .they did a quick rush job to get it on shelves... i was looking for the whole super fly home theatre experience, and this just bombed."
1,Just more hollywood.....,You could get the same effect of watching this movie by playing Enya at full volume all the while stabbing your leg with a fork. This movie falls way short of Braveheart by focusing too much on wooing the audience with digital effects. The soundtrack mimics Titanic by pulling at the heartstrings with cheesy vocal sonets that overlap every interesting part in the movie. It doesn't get anymore melodramatic than Gladiator.
1,Too much of everything...,"The effects maybe great but I couldn't stand watching all that voilence. I know it's a true story but they could have avoided showing all those heads coming off. It's a waste of time to watch this movie.If it was bad for Rome to have it's people enjoy those gladiators killing each other, it is equally bad for movies if one enjoys watching all that violence."
1,The Funniest Comedy I've seen in Years!!!!,"A delightful, care free romp through olden times. I laughed out loud several times. Definetly one for the whole family. A must see comedy! F"
1,Remember what good ol' Dr. Lecter used to say:,""" First principles, Clarice. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing ask: what is it in itself?""Answer on GLADIATOR: A turkey.P.S.: Richard Harris doesn't even look like Marcus Aurelius, but he sure resembles Ron Moody's Fagin in 'Oliver!' (see for yourself). Too bad director Scott didn't make this a musical!."
2,Bore Us Maximus,"A sluggish, lumbering, behemoth of a film that proves lavish sets and period costumes do not an epic make. Russell Crowe is alarmingly uninspiring as the wronged Roman general, Maximus. Only Joaquin Phoenix shines light on an otherwise drab film as the ... confused, dysfunctional Commodus."
2,Should have been better,"With Ridley Scott's name attached to a gladiator movie, I expected something good. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I hated the dog jumping through fire. I hated the musical score blatantly ripping off Gustav Holst' ""The Planets"". I hated the little boy who looked like pre-adolescent Adrian Lyne. I hated totally the UNCONVINCING cgi effects. I hated that the tigers didn't EAT any of the stadium combatants. I hated the completely miscast Joaquin Phoenix. I hate that the trailer featuring Kid Rock's ""Bawitdaba"" wasn't included on this dvd."
5,Not just a guy film,"One of my friends made a comment last night at a dinner party that Gladiator was a guys' only film. I couldn't agree less. I won't go into the story summaries as so many reviewers have already covered that territory, but this film is definitely a winner for women, as well. The story is engaging, the acting is amazing, and the cinemetography is divine. I'm the type of person who cried at the end of Terminator, so I know my tastes aren't for everyone, but this movie wasn't just a blood bath or gorefest as some people -- my friend included -- say. I own the film and watch it often. It's a true classic."
3,Disappointing ending,"Although the film have a ""Save Private Ryan"" type of starting and run smoothly, its ending was disappointing. First, the film doesn't save the best duet for last. Second, spectators of the duet cheers everytime the gladiator wins his duet, but remain calm after his last duet. I personally prefer sigh after cheer for this scene."
2,A Real Lullaby,"Man, this is supposed to be a really good movie, so I had high hopes. These hopes were shot down about ten minutes into it. Not only is this film boring, but the sound effects drove me nuts. The music is way too loud, the voices are so soft and muddled that I couldn't even understand what was being said half the time. Lots of violence - if that is what supposed to make this film great, it doesn't do it for me. (A headless horseman, big deal.) Parts of it were very confusing and hard to follow. I still don't understand the poisonous snake scene. Maybe if I could have heard the dialogue over the background noise I'd have a better opinion of the movie. Part of the problem, I think, is that it's a guy film. Perhaps it's something a woman like me just can't appreciate. What WAS that snake doing there?"
3,Another OK Movie of 2000,"I don't really understand why people like this movie so much, maybe its the fighting, maybe its the hype. But anyway for me the acting, cinomatography, and etc. was perfect depicting ancient Rome. The thing I have problem with is the screenplay. It just doens't flow right. The part of Ceaser's Death almost made me fall sleep not to mention I still don't get it. And after Ceaser died the story is only about a man fighting well as a gladiator-which is very predictable. The only thing that saved this movie from my boring list is its twist ending (not telling you what it is). But overall this movie is only ok because some scenes like the beginning and last scene are excellent but many of them in between are pointless."
5,"Academy members, read this!","This movie might be a tad long, and some of the dialoge may be less than intriging, but overall, Gladiator is a top-notch movie. Reason #1: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and all the others are all at their best. Reason #2: Gladiator is not one of those kill, kill, kill movies where all you think about is who will die next. Although there are some of those ""I think I'm gonna hurl"" moments, there is a lot more to this movie. Reason #3: Ridley Scott & Co. do a good job of recreating Rome as it might have been back in 180 A.D. This is a movie that, I think, will win these Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor-Russell Crowe, Best Supporting Actor-Joaquin Phoenix, Best Director-Ridley Scott, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Choreography. That might sound like a bit much, but once you see the movie, I can almost promise you that you'll agree with me."
4,Gladiator,"This is too good of a movie with such great effects to watch on one-half of the TV screen. What's up with this widescreen format being stuffed down the viewers throat. Take it or leave is not good enough for me. DVD formatting is a great audio and video advancement, let's have the ability to view it on the full formatted screen."
4,IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT ?,Great job on the part of Crowe.. Awesome job... a little too much gore in this movie .. but great job..
2,Wait for it to be done right,I watched and compared the Blu-ray to my DTS DVD. Don't support this kind of crap transfers. I will wait for this to be done right. I gave it two stars only for the audio. The video is really annoying!
5,Perfect in itz pure form,"Well, here I am again. I have watched all of this film and I have to say.. Wow! I watched it in the theater and forgotten about how good this movie is. Russel Crowe, got to give it to him. He's been in films before and now he is a star. The plot, the characters, and the special effects were just awesome. Problem, only in WIDE SCREEN. OMG, why didnt they make it both in wide and t.v. I'm sorry, I'm not going to go buy a wide screen t.v. just because most of the action flicks are wide screen. I be damned. Well until my next review.... Cya! IM OUT!!"
3,Spartacus + special fx,"This is a good movie. Russel Crowe delivers a strong performance as a wronged general, slave and then of course, gladiator. His nemesis is young Commodus the emperor played desperately by Joachin Phoenix. The best elements of the movie are the splendid battles and the action filled contests of the colliseum. The digital effects are riveting if somewhat gory. A fine adventure, low on story and high on sword slash."
5,Beautifully executed historical fiction,"Thoroughly entertaining, exciting historical epic with great special effects, production values and especially wonderful performances from Crowe, Reed and Nielsen. Obvious care and affection went into even the smallest details and it shows with a moving and emotional story. A winner on every level!"
1,DNR + EE = Ruined classic.,"I agree with the other recent reviews, the Blu-ray version of this is a travesty. The EE + DNR persistent throughout makes it almost unwatchable. The only good parts are the extended sequences, but they only last for a fraction of the movie's running time. Avoid at all costs!"
2,Disappointing!!!,"Having heard so many wonderful things about this film, I expected a lot. I was quite disappointed - great cast but not great acting. I was bored through most of it and not even Russell Crowe was worth watching. He is most brilliant in ROMPER STOMPER!GLADIATOR certainly does not measure up to the great SPARTACUS!!!"
3,"the movie is ok, but what's the END?","The production of the movie is fine, but I am not understanding what is this movie going to tell me. Two men die and the woman speaks a lot at the end of the movie, but that has nothing to do with the main theme."
1,WAT??......ANOTHER EDITION?????,"IT REALLY STINKS!!!FIRST IT WAS SINGLE DISC, THEN THERE WAS A 2 DISC RELEASE AND NOW AN EXTENDED 3-DISC EDITION IS UP FOR PRE-ORDER.CAN SOMEONE AT DREAMWORKS CLARIFY HOW MANY MORE EDITIONS WILL WE HAVE??PUBLISHING HOUSES LIKE DREAMWORKS ARE TOO BUSY CASHING IN ON GREAT MOVIES LIKE GLADIATOR AND ARE JUST NOT BOTHERED ABOUT THE HARD EARNED MONEY PEOPLE SPEND ON BUYING EARLIER VERSIONS OF THE MOVIE."
2,Gladiator,"I have the DVD myself I bought from the store and does not come in the way this one did, it is very dark, can hardly make out what is going on, very hard to watch, not happy with it."
1,Blu-Ray Shroom-Ray,"Honestly I thought the reviews on the blu-ray version were a bit harsh. But after seeing the HD version myself I cannot fathom why anyone would fork over their hard earned cash for something so sub-par. Honestly, Ridley Scott HAD to have known about this..or maybe he just doesn't care about his products anymore? The faces honestly look like something out of a wax museum. Yes, the arrows in the beginning are GONE. Facial close-ups resemble a painting. My Open Matte version is light years aheads of this drek. Please do not give in to such shoddy marksmanship..whomever mastered this abomination should be fired immediately and replaced by an agent who knows what they are doing.Sad."
3,Amazon still selling old Bluray version,Be careful when ordering this item from Amazon.Paramount remastered the disc and released a new version in July 2010.They did not recall the old version and there must a lot of inventory out there.I checked with Amazon before ordering but still received the old version.I could have returned the item to Amazon but decided to just exchange the disc with Paramount.
5,"pretty good extra on oliver reed, other than that, not really worth the extra money",Your best bet is to go with the one disc special edition.
1,did not play,"Im sure there was nothing wrong with the company itself but the movie they shipped me, which was marked as ""good,"" did not play on three dvd players as well as an xbox and ps3"
2,Detestable,"Just what we need. Hollywood has outdone itself. A new low in bogus history and gratuitous ultra-violence. It appears that our kids haven't yet been fed enough ignorance and callousness to human life. Excellent technical production, very good acting, corny script, and criminal intent by our commissars of popular culture. In a more enlightened society, the purveyors of this poison would be dragged from their Rolls-Royces and shot."
2,"High gloss, thin content","For the Gladiator enthusiast, this DVD set does it proud, supplying almost everything you could desire in a collector's edition. It's a pity that the movie itself does not deliver. The production values are gorgeous, but the storyline is so thin that its straightforward unfolding contains no surprises, and in essence the movie devotes its more than two hours of running time to a story of just three characters."
1,Defective DVD,I did not buy this from Amazon.com but I must say that this DVD is defective. I have already gone through 2 of them and they have severe video problems. It wasn't my DVD players fault. I wouldn't suggest buying this until they recall them and fix them.
2,I can't begin to tell you how dissapointing Gladiator was,"Ridley Scott's made TV commercials before feature films. I never saw that style in his films (Alien, Blade Runner) before. In commercials there is not time to develop an idea so commercial makers get you aroused with style rather than substance. So it is with Gladiator. The fight scenes are exciting but meaningless. I couldn't really tell what was going on but it was exciting. Some of the transitions reminded me of a car ad. The dialog was not good. There was no economy in developing the characters so the movie is 20 minutes too long. If you want to see a great spectacle then rent Ben Hur."
1,What a waste of 30 minutes,"What is all the hype about this movie. After 30 minutes I was so bored that I turned it off and watched Battlefield Earth, good movie BTW. The video quality is awesome, the sound quality is ok. This movie is too predictable. Too much time was spent getting a million different shots on the battle seens. This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched in whole or in part."
1,garbage,this movie totally sucked --- someone else agreed on here so i`m not alone--the dialogue the plot everything is ridiculous but i agree too- all the hype had me expecting something great-- not one scene was any good and nothing that even approached that chariot scene from ben hur and that was made a million years ago --- nothing was convincing or beleivable or exciting or anything---hated it ! rip off !
1,"A Braveheart wanna-be. Shame on you, Scottmus.","I have been of the opinion that Ridley Scott is an opportunist with no originality. While Braveheart itself fabricates history, it is not without some enthusiastic immitators. Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator.I realize it's a matter of personal taste, but the choice of Crowe as the leading character is a poor one. There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe. I can't put my finger on it, but it's a persistent problem with Crowe as far as I am concerned.Now back to Scott. His latest venture, Kingdom of Heaven, again follows the Braveheart formula, and exploits the hatred towards Islam in the West. An opportunist he is."
5,Simply GREAT!,"I bought this video sight unseen. No, never saw it on the big screen but I got such a great deal and I do like Roman Gadiator type movies so I thought ""what the heck"" and bought it.I am SO glad I did -- and so sorry I didn't see it on the big screen!It doesn't matter what this film did to history. What's written in history is mostly made up anyway. This movie probably came closer than we think. Who cares? Russell Crowe is spectacular in his understated performance as Maximus (he deserved the Oscar he got) and Mr. Phoenix was also superb. As a matter of fact, the entire cast was well suited, including Derek Jacoby, Richard Harris and the always wonderful and (much missed) Oliver Reed.And the end - well - it was moving and so well done. A very happy unhappy ending if you ask me.GLADIATOR is a movie for people who like heroes."
5,Can you say BEST?,This has to be one of the best movies ever created. The acting is out of this world. The scenery is outstanding! I can watch this movie on repeat.
5,Gladiator DVD,"I was completely satisfied with this transaction. I guess the only thing I would like to have known is the condition of the disk. When the seller said it was in 'good' condition it was because of the case and not the DVD itself. This was a relief because I was under the impression it would be the actual disk. Either way it shipped faster than expected, I received it earlier and the transaction was as smooth as the come. I thank the seller for the excellent service and wish other sellers would emulate these good traits. No complaints here, extraordinary service."
2,What a disappointment,"The most overrated and disappointing movie in years. Cheesy special effects, lurid overracting, ponderous, cliche-filled story. I have rewatched it several times, thinking, ""It can't be that bad. I must have missed something. There must be more to it."" Well, it is that bad, I didn't miss anything, and there's nothing mroe to it than that."
3,entertaining production that strives at quality,"Probably another of Ridley Scott's tributes to kubrick, certainly does not compare to spartacus - again like most films nowadays too much technology and too little attention to the screenplay. The cinematography and Scott's direction carry the film. The fact that Russell Crowe was voted sexiest actor is another sign of the times. Overall, another addition to the line of movies that entertain and not much more."
4,"Great movie, lousy video","Enough's been said about this movie that I don't need to repeat it. Loved the movie, but unfortunately this video is not worth the money. (Not that I think any video is worth $112, but that's another subject!) It's a shoddy video transfer-I guess the powers that be were focused exclusively on the DVD release. Thanks guys, really appreciate that. The colours are muddy and off. Check the scenes w/Marcus Aurelius watching the battle in the very beginning. In the theatre, his cloak was a glorious Imperial Purple, but here it was a dull blue-green. I watched this video on 2 seperate TV/VCR set-ups, so it wasn't the equipment. Unfortunate that while the DVD gets all the extra footage and behind the scenes stuff, those of us purchasing the video get stuck w/sub-par quality. It can't ruin the movie, but it makes the viewing less enjoyable and leaves the consumer feeling ripped off. ."
4,Cinematic tour-de-force,"I was very impressed with the production values of both the original film and the DVD. The movie is rendered with excellent skill on virtually all levels: camera work, lighting, musical score, sets... everything. It stands as a stunning tour-de-force of the cinematic arts.The actual screenplay and the rendering of it are a little less impressive. While it certainly makes for enthralling viewing, there are several instances where the story drags, becomes unnecessarily complex, or leaves leaves plot complications dangling unresolved. For these minor sins I rate the movie four stars instead of five."
4,Recommended for Gladiator Fans,"I felt the images were a little grainy for a 1080p blu-ray like many other older movies that were re-released as Blu-Ray.I still would recommend buying this for the extended scenes. In the original, we assumed the character's thoughts/feelings through their facial expressions or small acts, but with the extended scenes, they become clear."
2,PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE,"The movie Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray] gives error ""THIS PLAYER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH REGION MARKING OF THIS DISK"" while playing on Sony BDP-S380.It works perfectly on my laptop's blu ray disc drive. The picture quality is good but the audio is just okay. NOT WORTH THE ENTHUSIASM.All other bluray movies play perfectly on Sony BDP-S380. Only this particular movie is showing error.BPD firmware is already updated through internet. I have requested sony to deploy new updated firmware to solve this problem."
1,A mess. Paramount took my original blu-ray for swap and never sent a replacement,The original disc with all of its edge enhancement and plastic-looking skin tones was replaced this summer by Paramount. They posted an address where you could send disc one of the original blu-ray. After waiting four months and sending a couple of emails the end result is I'm out the original blu-ray and never received the replacement disc. I will avoid Paramount discs in the future as the way they handled this entire exercise was a mess.
5,Great movie!!!,This is the only movie I can watch over and over. I think I have seen it over 10 times and still enjoy it. Looks great on blu-ray
2,Where's the Plot?,"After hearing all the hype about Gladiator, I was dissappointed to see it for myself ( DVD version ). I was told that the fight scenes were good, and they were, but the rest of the movie is just filler. There is almost no plot whatsoever, and what little there is is so incredibly predictable it's almost sad. The best part of the 2 disc DVD set is the real history of the gladitorial games on the second disc. Give this one a miss."
5,Gladiator (Extended Edition) is Great,Truly a masterpiece. This DVD belongs in every collection. The extended edition has some additional scenes which were not in the original release. Worth a little extra money.
1,Why did this win best picture?,"It is a great action movie. Keyword there is action. Best picture is supposed to be a drama, and Gladiator is far from and excellent drama. In fact all the dramatic scenes were pretty bogus. I cant even believe people voted Gladiator the best-best picture of all time. Gladiator should never have won best picture. If action movies won at the oscars than why hasn't Arnold won an oscar. Arnold's action beats Ridley Scott's any day. Another epic by another Aussie is 6 thousand times better: Braveheart. William Wallace has chunks of guys like Maximus in his stool. Braveheart is far and away a better best picture candidate. In fact every other best picture winner is better than Gladiator, because Gladiator never should have won best picture."
1,Shockingly bad,"I must have seen some kind of ""director's cut"" of Gladiator; that's the only way that I can explain the fact that everyone seems to like, or at least to tolerate, this complete waste of film stock.I've rarely seen a movie with a real budget that was more poorly written. Every line made me wince. And the historical inaccuracies are so widespread that it's really not possible to talk in any meaningful sense about this movie being a tale of ancient Rome.You'll probably like it, though -- everyone else seems to."
2,Bleck!,"When I heard this film won best picture, I was shocked. Okay, maybe I wasn't. . .but I was appalled. This movie is NOT GOOD! There are some great actors in Gladiator. . .but what a waste of talent. The plot is so hackneyed and Hollywood, and call me female, but I don't find prisoners being hacked to bits entertaining. He's forced to be a Gladiator, so he decides to be the best darn gladiator there ever was. . .Yeah! Doesn't that fill your heart with a warm, rosy glow?? UH, NO!! And the emperor getting down there to fight with him. . .that was the last straw. . .even Caligula would've called that crazy. If we're cheering when people are being slaughtered, I don't see how we're any better than the ancient Romans. Sure, it's a movie, but to find it entertaining. . . ."
1,Zulus in the Teutoburger Wald?,"This movie lost all credibility, and me, after the first battle scene between the Romans and the Germans when the Germans were chanting in Zulu.I'm pretty sure that whoever did the sound editing on this film was high when they inserted that little gem.It sounded great at Rourkes Drift*, but really stupid in the German forest.I assumed that from that point onward the film would go downhill accordingly...and I was not disappointed.* The movie was ""Zulu"" with Michael Caine, Stanley Baker and Jack Hawkins."
5,A must have for your DVD library,"This movie should have taken home all of the oscars, even the ones they were'nt nominated for. Gladiator is a must have for the DVD collector, Next to the ""Matrix"" this is the most viewed movie On my home theater, Got 5.1 digital surround sound? This movie brings everything to life, from the spectacular screenplay to the outstanding Score. I give it 5-5-5-6 all hands and feet."
3,To Be Diffrent Is Not To Be Mad,"Everyone in the world can be diffrent and it means they aren't mad.Edgar Wieau is one of the most young man who want to change the interests and the understand of the old generation. I'm a student from Bulgaria. I learn in the German language high school and I know very well what means to be diffrent. Edgar fell in love and the problem is that his loved woman has a boyfriend just like in the Goethe's book ""Die Leiden des jungen Werther"" and therefore he murder himself because he has no willingness to live. His life has no sense for him. That's why he interrupt his own vitality. In the Goethe's story about the afflicted Werther is just the same. Werther has an impossible love. He commited suicide with a view to wait Charlotte to come by him. Werther is one very desperated person just like Wiebau. He is very agressive and spontanous that's why he took one's own life. therefore my next titel can be: ""There's no pale between the Life and the Death!"""
1,Ugh! I finally gave up!,This book was so awful I couldn't make it past page 60. The plot was boring. The sentences drag on and on endlessly. I kept waiting for something that made sense...I didn't find anything and finally threw the book down and gave up. I will not read anymore of this book or the series!!!!
4,Intriguing fantasy,"A very intriguing fantasy series from Diane Duane. The first time I read this book, it struck me as a little dark at times, but it should be appropriate for all middle grade and higher readers. I love the new covers the publisher has put on, and I can't wait for #6 to come out in paper!"
5,"interesting, different approach to magic","The thing that I most enjoyed about this great book was the approach it took to magic. It didn't have people muttering odd words and have things suddenly start happening. All of the magic was totally ""scientific"". It approached magic as a science, not an unexplained phenomenon. The first book (So You Want to be a Wizard) was definetly the best, but also the most frighteningly scary. It was utterly freaky when Nita and Kit were in the alternate Manhattan."
2,"For the 9-12-year-olds, not higher","This book is the first in a series about a girl named Nita and a boy named Kit, and their struggles, experiments, and interesting discoveries towards becoming wizards.I must say, however, that I didn't like it very much. The book is nice in and on itself, but this time the suggested age (9-12) actually fits! Usually I don't pay any attention to that sort of thing, but around 120 pages in the book (after forcing myself to read that far) I simply could not turn another page and still respect myself, even though I had told myself I must finish it. I wasn't even interested in the ending. I see the entire book as quite predictable and possibly a bit too childish, but maybe 9-12-year-olds will like it better.So, in conclusion, if you're above 12, don't buy it."
2,it's ok,"when i first got this book i thought it sounded really good. but, when i actually got it and started reading it i just couldn't get into it or relate to it. the characters seemed kinda fake and the whole plot was very unbelievable. i just couldn't even imagine it. there's this 'person' that they can't even name because somehow that makes him even more powerful and they are talking to a white hole ... and it's like how does he talk? and you can't really imagine inanimate objects talking or thinking or even living, which in the book they do. i mean isn't that why they're called non-living? the book itself was good but if you're looking for something that you can relate to more or imagine or if you just want to get into the book then you probably shouldn't count to much on this one. (the 4th one was a little better though, still not very believable, but better)"
4,"Good, but not great","I picked up ""High Wizardry,"" the third book in this series, about two years ago because I was looking for something to read for the few days before Christmas. That didn't last long - I was finished it barely after Christmas break had started! Anyway, I liked it a lot and decided to start from the beginning.""So You Want To Be A Wizard"" was good, but not great. Since I'm not a seasoned science fiction reader (I go more for high fantasy) I found some of the technical terminology that Duane uses somewhat confusing. The magic that the wizards use in this book is a mixture of scientific equations and traditional magic like that we see in Harry Potter, complete with wand-waving. It's an original and unusual way to look at the ageless myths of magic and wizards, sorcery and battles against evil, and I would recommend it to those who like sci-fi and even some who like fantasy. But, if high fantasy is more what you're looking for, I suggest Tamora Pierce's ""Song of the Lioness"" quartet."
4,Accurate readings,"This product appears to be accurate and was fairly easy to install. I would like larger print on the screen as it is hard to read at a glance (the numbers are large enough, but the lettering is small)."
2,Difficult for a lay person,"I found this book was not very reader-friendly. It was interesting, but not interesting enough for me to finish..."
1,your life...,"do you realize how dangerous it is for u to sell this book Know one is going to by it because of its history and the very well known fact that NO ONE WHO HAS THIS BOOK IS SUPPOSESED TO TALK ABOUT IT LIT ALONE SELL IT..SO PEOPLE WILL FIRST ASSUME IT IS WITH OUT A DOUBT FAKE,AND THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL PEOPLE BELIVE U ARE A CRAZED MEMBER OF THE FREEMASONS AND OR TRYING MAKE A PROFIT ON THERE SCARED BOOK OF DOGMA AND RITULS WHICH IS STRICLY FORRBIDDEN AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND TAKE IT DOWN.....Be Well.............."
4,Classic,This record is a reggae classic. A must for anyone into roots reggae. To bad Aswads other records aren't anywhere near this good.
4,Poster,"The poster was delivered quickly, no damages, was rolled up in a tube. I have to sy that it is a little paler than what you see on your screen, but otherwise is beautiful"
5,Deep Wizardry is a classic!,"Caution: the book itself really *is* magic -- when you finish it, you won't be the same person you were when you started it.This is the book you give your kids because you know that not only will they be in good hands but also that they will become better people for having read it.""Deep Wizardry"" (written decades before Harry Potter) is one of those timeless books that will live in the hearts and minds of everyone who reads it."
2,Deep Wizardry,This book was so boring... It could have been a lot more effective if it was shorter and more to-the-point.
5,"Can you ""see"" between the lines?","Check out this book and see for yourself? I am not going to go into detail, I see that has been done quite well. I thought this was a great book. The story was interesting, unique and compelling. The main characters were indepth with astounding chemistry. Overall, for a classic romance, I highly recommend this book. You will not be dissappointed, I have already read the book twice. I will be checking out more books by this author."
3,Not as great as I had hoped -- 3 & 1/2 stars,"Teresa Medeiros if one of my favorite authors. Often her novels ring with powerful emotion. Occasionally she does miss the mark. I enjoyed this book, but it's not my favorite. While I liked both of the characters and though the author did a wonderful job of writing, I never became emotionally attached to the lead characters.Samantha's secret actually detracted from the book for me. Her transformation did not ring true. Actually, it was only as her secret began to unfold that I became uneasy with the story. I had really enjoyed the book until then, but at that point, it became too easy, too pat a resolution.It's a good book but flawed, in my opinion."
2,A Student - 14 yrs old,"This book was very boring until the end. I wanted it to get over because I had to read it for school. It wasn't horrible, but it was pretty bad."
2,Doesn't fit,"I have two SKS rifles one chinese and one yugo and the pad does not fit either. The mounting holes line up just fine; but, the overall size is too small."
2,not wedding music,"*wedding* favorites??? I don't think so! Music from Fiddler is nice, but it's still Broadway. Hava Nagila may be useful, but it sure is trite--So much great other fast music, why go with that one?! Raisins and Almonds is a lullaby! Do they know something about the bride that we don't?! My Yiddishe Momme is a sad song. Not the best for a wedding. Dona Dona is a song of suffering and freedom, a song that dates back at least to the '40s and has taken folk-song status--again, not really for a wedding. So, this may not be a bad album, it's just not wedding music."
5,A Fantastic Ride in the Country,"Can't get over the average customer reviews I find on Amazon, makes me think there are a lot of frustrated novelists or at the very least wannabe book reviewers out there. Take this book for example. I loved it. I've never been to India and after all that's happened in recent months I doubt I want to set foot on its shores. But I picked up this book after it got a great review in my local paper and I loved it. Maybe it's because I like big lush informative sagas like Barbara Kingsolver's THE POISONWOOD BIBLE but I thought this novel was fantastic. It gave me a brilliant sense of place, I laughed and wept with its characters and I now have a sense of why India is the way it is. And the author sure can write. Talk of lyrical beauty! Take a ride with Solomon on his bullock cart through rural India and you'll know what I'm talking about."
1,Barf! Barf!! Not tasty...,"Some are comparing this to God of Small things...Are you kidding me?The novel is cutout with artificial characters masquerading as historical ones. Some of the characters teach us georgraphy and history lesson on India and sound like a mouthpiece for the author to air his opinion about the Colonial British (White man?), India, caste system, Christianity, Hindu mythology etc..I understand this is work of fiction but the novel is so full of contrived characters and settings detailed in superficial tone. If you liked novels of Vikram seth and Arunadhathi roy...stay away from this!!"
4,Compact and light,"My wife loves this. She always carries it with her. It is very light and quite spacious even though it is small. The color is quite bright, though."
1,Disappointing,"I don't doubt that this book has some helpful tips for parents with introverted children but just getting through the book in the first place was difficult. And while I do believe parents should help in some ways, the idea that you should change your whole way of doing things just to fit your introverted child is not going to help them when they get out in the real world and the real world does not cater to them like mommy and daddy did."
4,Well worth checking out,"The authors clearly love dogs. Some of the stories and testimonies left me in tears. However, as others have noted, some of the material in this book is not to be taken 100% seriously. Looking beyond that, they do make a great case for the mixed-breed dog -- a case that needs to be made at this time."
5,The Causes of the Civil War,"This book is a seminal work for any student of the Civil War. It gives the opinions of those that actually lived through it, opinions from before, during, and after the war. These opinions are conflicting of course. For me it was not the type of book you can just sit down and read but rather a book to browse from time to time. An absolutely fascinating book."
3,"Sure, Union troops fought to end slavery","Sure, just another book that on one hand tells us that only a small minority of Quaker 'fanatics' were abolitionists, and that the war was over expansion and not slavery, and then the next minute have us all believe that Union troops faught and died to end slavery when in many of their hometowns there were laws that forbid blacks, Indians, and mulatooes from staying in town after sundown. If you believe that people died for this, then you need to be reading bedtime stories. The war was fought over MONEY, POWER, and caused by disagreement between Constitutional Federalists and Jeffersonians. Even the Supreme Court ruled that secession was allowed under the Constitution (in 1862 I believe), but in their ruling said basically that 'this is our ruling, but to no avail, because the issue is being decided on the battlefields as we speak'."
4,A fascinating disc,"This CD includes one of Monk's few ""songs"" (with lyrics) -- ""The Tale"" -- which is a quirky, funny little piece -- and the 20 min title track, which was also titled at one point ""Stonehenge,"" I gather. Both of these are extremely strong cuts and worth listening to. My favorite Monk CD is BOOK OF DAYS, also transplanting us to some imaginary past; my second favorite is FACING NORTH, which, recorded in Banff, explores the feel of the arctic. Third on the list is DOLMEN MUSIC. Only serious devotees need proceed further, though DO YOU BE has some good moments, too (but is out-of-print, I think)."
1,Simon Sez Don't buy this movie,I watch this movie than gave it away or pawned it. Whatever. It's a lame movie.
2,What marketing wizard thought this up...,"...it sure wasn't an engineer, or anyone who regularly uses a laptop. It gets one star for the speakers, one for the nice weight of the base that securely holds the laptop. Negative stars for the crummy keyboard and mouse that I replaced with a better Microsoft product immediately. Negative stars for lack of legacy ports (I still have to buy a USB-to-Midi converter for lack of a gameport). Negative for the non-standard drive slot (which is too overpriced to consider) - so I still have to buy an external USB backup drive. Negative for the lack of its own power adaptor - have to buy an extra or else unplug junk when I need to travel with the laptop. So lets see... after laying out $200 for this thing, I still have to buy: an extra power adaptor, a new keyboard and mouse, a USB backup drive, and any legacy ports/converters I need. Two stars is generous for whats left."
1,Way too buggy for the price,"Yes, it has a great set of features, but they're meaningless if you can't keep the program from crashing! Inadequate documentation, poor support by Pinnacle (it's an obsolete product for them, so don't count on them for help), undocumented error codes, and more crashes than any program I've used before. The most frustrating is getting an error after waiting six hours for the video to be processed (which happens nearly every time).Not worth the price. ..."
5,Amazing,The breathtaking Impression DVD software will blow you away. With hollywood style features no other program can compete. You create professional quality movies with menus and burn them to DVD. With Dolby Digital support your audience will be amazed!
2,Tourism Isn't The Answer To Global Inequality,"The internet changed everything, and it changes issues raised in this book (example -- the Twitter domino democracy starting in Egypt). Today you can go on 'virtual tours' so basing an entire 'bridge' economy on tourism shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the first and third worlds. The problems of inequality stem from the lines of governmental forms and corruption, as opposed to increasingly spendy upbeat tourists (which the book focused on). The internationalist movement described had little real power, because the people involved were persecuted by their respective regimes.In short, an older idealism even back in it's day. Outdated and not worth reading, unless you are interested in the political-based advertising of third world tourism in the 1970-1980's."
5,excellent,this is a very good firewire card for dell or other desktops with a half size slot for pci cards. Another big bonus is the included Ulead dvd video editing software that comes free with this card.
5,must see,"masterpiece, i thing this movie got to sean penn's way of thinking, towards his progressive and more social point of view"
4,Use subtitles and you'll be happy,Considering that half the dialogue is unintelligible use the English subtitles option and view this as a foreign film (I'm not joking). Southern accents aren't usually too difficult to understand if you are from elsewhere however the actors are either from England or Brooklyn and I'll bet even Southerners can't understand them. Give it a try and you'll see that the movie becomes a lot more enjoyable.
1,The emperor has no clothes and Sean Penn can't act.,"In Penn's defense he is woefully miscast in this film. He is a depressive personality, not the type who could excite the masses.Jude Law is also miscast. He is too self-assured for the crisis of identity the novel's protagonist confronts.The novel has about 700 pages of riveting dialog. The screenplay captures none of it and rather leaves it to the film's composer to elicit an emotional response with overused scoring.I got about 30 minutes into this movie before I finally had to stop it. The offending incident was when the Gandolfini character is exposed in a speech and to underscore this, he falls into a pigpen. A director that would film such an incident should never work again."
5,Superb story of undeclared love...,"Oh my! What an unforgettable book... It is not only a love story, but a story of a governess. This story is told from the point of view of the nicest, cleverest, humblest, and sometimes funny main character Agnes (One of the best ""ever after"" main characters ever!), who becomes a governess to support her family. The first family she lives with is so weird! Read and and see for yourself how mentally wrong that family is, which is sad for their children. Even though it is a hard job, she does not give up and tries to help the children. However, it does not go as she had hoped! Then, she goes to a second family, and falls in love! This is the section that I am so OMG because of the way she describes herself falling in love , and not being able to do anything because of her circumstances and his circumstances! Oh, please read this book if you totally LOVE Jane Austen's Persuasion!"
3,The best part of this book is how to preserve your wild edible plant finds.,"Overall rating: 3 starsPlant identification: 2 starsPlant uses: 3 starsPicture type(s): black & white drawingsWho will find it useful: experienced foragers and homesteaders.Notes: This is an old, out of print book. The drawings range from average to poor. On the plus side, it does include nutritional values, medicinal information, some recipes, and information of freezing/preserving wild edibles. It also lists which wild seeds are good for sprouts which no other wild edible plant book does.This book also gives some plans for creating wild edible plant gardens though I feel a modern permaculture book such asGaia's Garden, Second Edition: A Guide To Home-Scale Permacultureis better for that."
5,MASTER OF The Rare Laserdiscs Movies OF The 80s,"I Love N&Y Scott Baio Deserves The 5 Star 'nd 'tis One of My Favorite Romatnic Movies,I have this One on LASER DISC,I got two Copies on LASERDISC [ One NEW] And [ One Used ] I just wonder Will this movie ever be released on DVD? :)"
5,Excellent-I'm hooked on Fygi,"This was the first album I heard by Laura Fygi and I found it to be enthralling. To date I have purchased every album she has put out and I must say, I have not been disappointed. I would give them all five stars. This is what music was meant to be."
1,NO - one-half star please!,"Don't buy! I know a friend with this disastrous CD and it's way over-produced and extremely slow. Insteading of bringing modernity to these songs from the 40's and 50's, Fygi manages somehow to gum them up with so much overweighted molasses and sugar that she has turned the clock back further on them - if not turned it off altogether!!If you don't get the message by now, you deserve to buy it and vomit. Its not worth any more words."
2,It's Spanish to Me,"Vincent D'Onofrio,apparently taking time off of ""Law and Order"" stars as a sleazy,bald antiques dealer who wants some valuable antique guns. Matthew Lillard stars as a conniving con man who's married to a woman expert in poisons.The movie is wannabe Quentin Tarantino&David; Mamet. Characters get shot,poisoned,the ending leaves you hanging (in more ways than one)It's artsy,pretentious nonsense. It makes for good early morning ""huh?"" viewing,but don't take it too seriously (though the director apparently does)"
1,Boring,"This game is boring, I mean I have a hard time getting the ball and the controls are hard. The music on it is annyoning too. It gets very tedious after 20 minutes. I don't recommend you buy this game, instead for the same price buy Resident Evil 4, a MUCH better game."
2,Informative but not an easy read.,"This book is defintely not for the average curious reader. The depth and detail of this book are amazing, but the prose seems almost to be purposefully difficult to read. Another problem is the lack of maps. An extensive list of maps would greatly improve this book. So would more easily followed style. Unless you are an expert, this book may not be for you."
2,Should come with a warning label...,"...that reads ""not for the layman"". Granted, I have only read about 100 pages of this book, but I doubt I will get to the end. It is divided into 3 sections on the Huns, Ghengis Khan, and Tamerlane. So far, so good, right? Nope. The author goes back and forth across such varied geographic areas and uses such far-flung place names so quickly that it is impossible for anyone without a PhD in Central Asian history or geography to keep up. Go ahead, I dare you to try. Now, I am not uneducated. I've read some great epic histories by Robert Massie and Steven Runciman that were hundreds of pages long and kept my interest to the very end. ""Empire of the Steppes"" barely held my interest at all.There are a few reviews here that say this book is the best on it's subject; surely there has to be one written in the last 60 years that is better...there has to be!! One written for the more casual reader who wants to be engaged, not overwhelmed."
1,Where's the beef?,"Trying to pack 3 states of immense geography into 272 pages? I'm sorry, but I didn't find any real substance here. Most of the info is sketchy and seems very limited. It only seems to scratch the surface. Pick a state and stick to it."
2,"Tons of fun examples, but argument-free","I admired Lutz's throughness in accruing examples, and there are many interesting sidebars and historical illustrations, but there's almost no point to this book at all. It reads somewhat like Marjorie Garber's latest works, except it's even more ""lite""--it's as if he had been so busy finding things to discuss relative to tears that he forgot to spend time actually discussing what sorrow and sentiment and sentimentality actually mean."
2,lead is wrong,"Solid cast, with the exception of the lead. Rooker from the first one should have been back, as well as the original director and writer: John McNaughton and Richard Fire, respectively.This director here doesn't seem to get suspense--and it hurt the film. There is just no beating the original. Too bad McNaughton and the rest from the first flick did not come back for an encore--because now, even if they did, it might be way too late.It's kind of sad, because McNaughton might have had a far bigger/impressive film career if he had.Skip this one. See the original (20 year anni issue, etc.). It will give you chills."
2,Disappointing,"After viewing the shocking original, I had high expectations for this film. This film lacks the intensity of the original and it wasn't the same without Michael Rooker as Henry. It copies a lot from the first film and just seems bland in comparison."
4,Just didn't like the map,"This citypack is a good thing to carry for those who are spending a couple days in the city and who want to hit only the highlights. The one thing that we didn't like about the combination was the map. It was too large and too detailed when all we really wanted was the Old Port and things closer to the river. Instead it included a lot of the town and suburbs, too. We ended up folding the map differently and using only a section of it."
1,BURY THIS ONE AT SEA AS WELL,"This film stinks. It is stupid and predictable. Any story involving the world's most famous twins will be a happy ending and a predictable story line. You don't need a prequel or a sequel. The songs are lousy. ""Who Would You Be"" is without a doubt the girls' worst tune. It has no redeeming features. ""Who would you be? A Kennedy"" is insulting to everybody's ears and intelligence. The song stinks and should be buried well below sea level.And yes, the girls' dad DOES recover his computer. With Mary-Kate and Ashley, would you expect otherwise?"
4,Once upon a Parable,"Dr. Steven Hairfield, I think, seems to have a deep understanding of the teachings of Jesus. Which to me is quite remarkable since he started out a Buddhist. I'm a Buddhist monk and enjoyed this book a lot. I believe both Jesus and the Buddha had their teachings undermined by the religious authorities, who somehow, maybe on purpose, lost the original meanings. Dr. Hairfield, at least with this book, brings those teachings back to maybe their original intentions."
2,I was expecting more.,To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I was expecting a little more in-depth discussion/. To me this seemed more like an infomercial. It does have some good information just not what I was expecting
3,Mehh,"This video is not really that in depth or scientififc. When I got this I was expecting more of a diet plan, but what it really was was just a documentary of someones trip to Japan (with all the unhealthy foods they ate there). of course I cant substantiate this with facts, but this whole video really seems like some proffesors sabatical project, which of course just boiled down into a vacation. all in all it was still worth the cheap price of admission, and was fairly entertaining to watch."
1,Price to quality ratio -> infinity,"Wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer. It's amazing something as simple as a tp holder can be so messed up ( and cost so much.) You are stuck with a fixed width that MUST fit your paper roll like a glove or else bathroom comedy ensues as the roll keeps falling off. I guess the previous owner enjoyed ""high-end"" toilet paper and I should be purchasing toilet paper commensurate to my high end bathroom accessories. /eyeroll"
1,I WANT MY 10 Bucks Back!,"Poor graphics, taped radio broadcast, what was this production company thinking?In this day and age there are better graphics and audio editors available to make this a better programme, unfortunately I found out after I downloaded this poor excuse of an movie!"
1,WHY!?,"The original was a sexy and track performed by a half decent R&B; group. RL and Next could really hit it off any make people want to dance. It was a good track in 98 and I think would be Next's biggest track.And theres this - a fake ass attempt from some pretty british boys to become an R&B; group. Blues version of this song is nothing but an attempt by the record company to cash in on others material and success.They dont add anything to the song, making it sound almost identical to the original. Even the backing track sounds almost the same as the original.I completely dislike this version of the song and I passionately dislike this group and everything they come out with. And yes, Iam very biased in my opinion here :)Blue - Stick to what you good at - singing at the pub or at the kareoke bars."
4,A great book that can be read on many different levels,"I really enjoyed this book. It perfectly balanced plot with symbolism and ideology. Camus' view of society isn't very good, but I guess that's expected during the era of Nazi Germany. I noticed that Camus' male characters always have broad shoulders. I love the scene where him and Tarrrou go to the balcony on top of the spaniard's house. I think the only drawback to the novel was that sometimes camus was hasty with his characterization. But regardless of that, the characters were very affecting."
5,Best Camus Book.,All I can say is WOW! everyone must read this for themselves so that is why i will only say that.
3,A Tough Read,"I have to say, I did not understand this book. I am probably one of the top english students in my high school class, one of the most capable of staying open minded while reading any book.But this book I simply could not understand. There were brief moments throughout the book where I would understand and I could tell what an incredible writer this man was. I can't tell you what translation it was that I did read, but maybe it was partly that...maybe it was because I was also reading an extremely poor translation of the Death of Ivan Ilyich at the time, but for whatever reason, I feel as though I missed the big idea of this book.To me, the only thing that is memorable is the amount of death.However, I am extremely willing to give it another go-- but it will have to wait until I get through my Russian kick and until I read a few pages of several different translations."
2,"Boring, trivial and disappointing","This book is a real disappointment after reading ""The Stranger"". It is effectively a journal-like chronicle on devastation the plague caused to a town.There is not much more to it. Characters are dull and uninteresting unlike those in ""The Stranger"". There is not much of a plot apart from chronicling the plague progression and some booring people it is killing.Two lessons I learned from reading it: don't catch the plague and don't read this book."
2,Dull,"I tend to agree with some minority reviewers that this book is boring and dull. It has some interesting thoughts here and there, but that is all. All in all, the book is quite over rated."
4,Go swimming!,"Anyone who dares struggle through this book must be in search of some life changing insight like I was. But insight can not be sought after, it is a gift. I spent too many hours dozing off during this long read only to come away with one life lesson - ENJOY LIFE as Rieux and Torreau did during their friendly swim! And if you want to enjoy life then don't struggle through this book like I did.I must admit though, I began the book sympathizing with Rambert - wanting to flee. My views haven't changed, but now I realize the value of perseverence, determination, and love.If you have the time to persevere through a long and sad book then give this one a shot."
5,This & Writings of Seneca is all you need from philosophy,"The Plague, don't mistake it for a 'Novel', and the Writings of Seneca are the only two things that western philosophy after early Greeks brought out that is worth internalizing IMHO. They answer the question that is more important than why we are here and where we came from. They tell us why we get up every morning and carry on as humans despite the unavoidable reality of death that will fulfil our forms when the time comes.As to the mechanical part, yes, the kindle edition is good, it is in fact a good translation of an extraordinarily difficult piece of writing. This is the one piece of Camus I do not manage to read in French, the language is too intricate but don't let that scare you, it reads well. Couple of spelling mistaken, probably due to scanning more than anything."
4,Great windshield mount.,This windshield mount works better than the original one supplied with the GPS. I really like the built in speaker. It maintains the proper volume no matter what the GPS is set to. The speaker doesn't have quite the tonal range as the GPS but is quite acceptable.
3,Interesting topic but overly depressing...,"Steven Wakefield, the twins older brother sees a girl that is the spitting image of his dead girlfriend Tricia Martin. He begins dating her, in the hope that he can rekindle the same feelings that he felt with Tricia. Unfortunately, Steven tries to make his new girlfriend look like Tricia by making her wear her hair the same way as Tricia did and act the same way. Will Steven be able to realise that Tricia's gone forever?"
1,"Boring, tedious, predictable...",I was extremely unhappy with this film. Speed-searching didn't even help. Don't waste your time.
4,Hell or High Water,It was an excellent movie and one I had not seen before. The DVD was clear and easy to handle and see.
5,amazing,"When I first heard the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, I fell in love with it. He is possibly the greatest composer of the century. His music is simply incredible. Anyone that does not own this CD should run out and get it immediately, along with his other CDs. My favorite songs are ""Triste,"" ""Inutil Paisagem,"" and ""Agua De Beber,"" but they're ALL good, I promise."
1,a thoughtful critique,"'Kay. I know Kubrick is, like, a ""total genius"" and all, but this movie was less coherent than a brain-damaged first-grader trying to explain to a neanderthal how to build a nuclear reactor (believe it or not that simile took two drunk people five minutes to come up with. hurray for college!).Wow, totally lost track of what I was trying to say about this movie. Suffice it to say, it sucked, just like every movie Kubrick made. The best part of any of his movies is when the end credits start rolling.~fin~"
5,I wish I could've put more than 5 stars- A true masterpiece.,"I loved this soooo much. I saw it about a month ago and I still like to talk about it. It's one of those movies that leave a lasting imprint in your mind, in other words, you'll have a hard time forgetting this spectacular movie, but who would want to forget it anyway?"
1,Good adaption of the book but.....,I think this is definately a great adaption of the book but I honestly believe that this is the type of movie you watch once and thats it. Strange is the best way to put it...if you are into strange movies and you like to watch them late at night when you cant go to sleep this one will put you to sleep...if not make you want to turn it off and count sheep instead.
2,Read the BOOK!!!,"This movie is so over rated. If you want to be amazed, read the book by Burgess, that will knock your socks off. The book is way better because it ends with Burgess original ending, something the movie doesn't end with. I wont tell you what happens just in case you do want to read it."
5,fantatic movie,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. An incredible social commentary, perfectly adapted from a visionary novel. A must for anyone old enough to accept the violence. If you've seen the movie, read the book. Slightly different ending makes both worth while."
4,A Cult Movie for sure but!!!,"The following comment won't please people , it is dated, why the adult rating still exists is beyond me and yes i have seen the film several times first in 1977 when it was still a shockerand other thing why was last chapter in the book never added to the movie"
3,WARNING: Great film - BUT NOT ANAMORPHIC!,"One of my favorite films. This DVD isn't Anamorphic even though it says it was released Feb 2004. I can't believe they are still making ""Letterbox"" films. Total rip-off!They need better labels.It is still a great film... I just hate being tricked!"
1,Horrendous!,"This movie represents 2 hours of my life that I wish I had back! Two hours that I could have been dusting my house or listening to Kenny G! If zero stars were an option, that's what I'd give it. I just kept wishing it were over, but out of sheer stubborness I finished watching the entire thing (not a prudent move)! Thank God I checked it out from the library and didn't waste 4 dollars to rent it! Maybe in 1972 it would have been something to rave about (cinematography, score, blah, blah, blah) but it is terribly dated and I can think of a dozen classier ways to get the moral of the story across than this! Maybe if you're in film school you may get a shred of something worthwhile out of it (maybe not), but for the majority of us who aren't, it's a complete waste of time!"
2,questionable,"so i finally watched the movie after i heard all it's praise, and it wasn't worth the money. So the book has potential because i thought the story was alright, but things were dragged on incredibly long. Such as the rape scenes, those were show much longer than actually needed. so i say again that maybe the book show more potenial. but as for the movie, it's another thing ruined by the decade of the 70's."
5,Clockwork Orange,"I received this movie way ahead of the scheduled delivery date and it was package well. I remember watching this movie as a kid, watching it again as an adult brought back many memories..... Defininetly a CLASSIC!!!"
1,stick with vhs..not wide sceen..not even stereo,"great movie, but only on vhs..why would they put out a dvd that is not even stereo????"
3,like the real world,"Not a family film, fully-naked ladies, sex, and murder. At times, this film seemed quite long, at others it was the most vulgar I have ever seen a film, and still at others I couldn't help but chuckle. It was entertaining, but beyond that, I'm not sure what to say about it..."
5,Second movie in a very special trilogy.,"I am a fan of Stanley Kubrick, and I can see something very special about this movie, that makes me consider this one as the second installment of a so called, by myself, ""trilogy"". 2001: A Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange & The Shining, they three share a feeling of loneliness, a sense of an external consciousness who is watching, from outside the Universe, the characters in the films, there is a feeling of a paranormal environment, manifest by the lighting, the sharp contrast of colors white, blue, red and fog in some of the scenes. And, this special environment is made even more surreal by the very special soundtracks of ""Atmospheres"" by Gyorgy Ligeti , ""Timesteps"" by Wendy Carlos, or the score in The Shining by Carlos' couple too. Perhaps these three stories are part of the intervention of the Black Monoliths on the development of Mankind...Who knows? Buy these movies, they are highly recommended."
4,An Okay Movie,"This was a very well directed movie. Kubrick really did his homework on this movie. The feel of young Alex (mcdowell) as a gangster doesn't get you to like him in the beginning but near the mid way point and the end you have a certain respect for him. The thought of someone who Rapes, Beats, and Murders his victims to something horrible and then going to prison, and then gaining his gangster soul back makes this an amazing movie"
1,More Kubrick drivel,Rant time.SK seems hooked on sex and violence. He uses Burgess' book as a vehicle for his warped mind to work on. It is a sick movie. The themes put forward in the movie could have been done in a less thoroughly perverse way.If he had seriously wanted the world to benefit from his interpretations of Burgess' book it may have been better for him to have toned it down but that's no good because you can achieve notoriety and fame for producing 'art' that appeals to a relatively minor group too with a lot less effort hence Clockwork Orange the movie.The pluses were that Malcolm McDowell did a great job and that the music was awesome shame the movie didn't live up to it. For that it gets one star.Sho.
2,Kubrick does not do Burgess' masterpiece justice,"The book was incredible. Fresh and stirring. Also, wonderfully disturbing. The movie, however, never made it past ""disturbing."" The performances and direction fell extremely short of what could have been done with Burgess' amazing novel. Perhaps my mistake was in reading the book before watching the flick. Either way, it's obvious that Kubrick was attempting to inject the same level of art and originality into the filmmaking as Burgess did into the book, but, sadly, it was a dismal failure, in which the integrity of the book was lost. Kubrick was a very talented director, but he unfortunately missed the boat with ""A Clockwork Orange."""
1,wacky but lack luster,lots of wacky humor poor quality though not very well made give s bad ideas to kids movie down right is crap
1,Too psychadelic.,"I watched this movie and could not stand it. It's overdone sets and costumes that may have been ""cool"" in the seventies look just dumb now. Kubrick didn't go to any lengths to make this film look like the future as he did in 2001, which I think is boring, but much better than this film. It's portrayal of nudity (both male and female) should have awarded it an X rating, and I can't see why it didn't. Maybe because they mixed it with violence (Does that make sense. I didn't think so.) And I have absolutely no simpathy for Alex and he got exactly what he deserved."
5,Stuck in my mind for much too long,"I've never watched a movie that opened up so many questions for me as this one. I watched it on what one could call a lazy Saturday afternoon (!), but it soon was changed into something more than that. I just couldn't stop thinking about the movie, not the next day, nor for the week after that. I still wonder about its whole theme, its visual qualities, etc.I agree, watching it on a Saturday afternoon is probably not the most ideal time... and watching it with someone who is offended at nudity (as I watched it with) isn't recommended, either. The scenes depicted within are not the nicest things to watch, even 30 years after they were originally filmed and pop culture has gotten more rowdy.If you want to be totally perplexed to a movie, watch this."
4,Okay on blu-ray,"This is a classic movie (for adults only), but I'm not overly impressed with the blu-ray version. I could not clearly tell any difference between my dvd and blu-ray versions like I could with Full Metal Jacket. I'm not sure it was worth spending extra for the blu-ray version."
3,Shipping?,"I can't believe I was so stupid! Where was my head when I ordered three boxes of K-Cups, and agreed to $15.00 for shipping? I will never do that again! I'm definately going to pay more attention from now on! And I'll never order from ""Stay at home Mom"" again.I know I like the coffee, but I can get the same deal at full retail locally."
5,Bomb Proof,These things are heavy duty and thick. The stock ones they replaced are so wimpy next to these things. Quality devices.
4,What can I tell ya?,"I am a bon jovi fan, what can I say? I have this CD, and I listen to it, I don't like it that much but I still listen to it - I think I'll listen to anything he'll record, but the CD itself it's not that good, late 80s when it's not Rock N' Roll and not POP, but something undefined in the middle? hmm... anyways, has soom good songs like Runaway, so I guess it worth the money."
3,This album isn't as good as the other ones.,"This album is alright, but it isn't that good. If you are a true bon Jovi fan, then you might want to listen to the sound samples first. But then again, this is when they had hair like marge simpson and when everybody looked like a girl. If you watch the videos, you'll see what I mean. But don't go off thinkin' that all of there albums are the same because there not. As the years went on Bon Jovi became alot more mature in their music and more serious stuff than ""runaway"". Overall, it's not that bad."
3,Hard to use,"I have used Cokin filter system for years and find their products generally very good and practical. The circular polarizer was another good product, although it did have one flaw. To use a polarizing filter, you need to be able to rotate it in relation to the scene you are photographing to achieve the desired effect. The fit of the circular polarizer in the Cokin filter holder is so tight, however, as to make rotating the filter more difficult than it should be. Other than that, it was a very good product."
5,Too much for the world,"This movie was true, to point and too much for people to watch and not get the point. It hides nothing. Brings the truth about the Gosples of Christ to your face, without error. And Luther has an attitude I can relate to. He wants the poeple to know the word and not fall into the lie that you have to pay to get into Heaven. He don't care who stands in his way, or for what law of the church they put against him. This movie also puts the lies of present day under examination. What we give is our life, because Christ gave his, it was never silver and gold."
4,Worth watching,"The movie was well done and dramatic. The acting was good, although one could tell it was sectarian.My one main criticism is that the story did not portray the decisive factor in Luther's conversion - Justification by faith alone - sufficiently. This was the lynchpin and pivotal doctrine that separated Luther from the Catholic church and the papacy."
5,luther,"here is a common theme in history, another man or men taking a profound truth and distorting it, to satify thair own distructive agenda."
2,Thought I was ordering something I wasn't,"I assumed that since the picture posted was a pic of a DVD, that I would be getting just that. But I should have read the information a little more thoroughly, turns out I was ordering a VHS. Too bad I got rid of my VHS player years ago and can't use it."
1,Luther movie (VHS),"As the teacher of a women's Bible class in a Lutheran church, I showed this movieLuther [VHS] after the class had completed six weeks of study on Dr. Martin Luther's life and influence on the Protestant Reformation. I would highly recommend this product because it stays true to historical facts and is not ""padded"" for today's audiences."
4,Got wrong dvd,"I love the movie, because I've seen it before, but the one I received from Amazon was not formatted for USA dvd players and could not be viewed"
2,uninspired,This film avoids all real controversy. It is more of a hagiography than a drama. Some of the arguments prevented are well acted and the historical mood is reproduced artistically.
4,"Understanding history, culture, and crazy religious cults & denominations","As I studied in college courses, I was glad that I had seen this film, and own it. Luther, though a bit of a nutcase, was an important historical figure, and this film explores aspects of the Catholic church which everyone should know about.Whether you care about religion or not, this information is historically important. The movie is enjoyable, and I recommend it. Protestant people may worry a little, about the foundations of their spiritual path, but people often Refer to Luther and they should know more about him.College students can save time by watching this film, as well. ;-)"
5,The best religion based film I've ever seen,"While ""Luther's"" historical accuracy is questionable in several places, I believe the spirit of the film is intact. We don't realize how many ways we are blessed in this society. ""Luther"" takes you back to a time when mothers who couldn't afford to put bread on their tables were buying indulgences for their crippled children. You weren't just expected to ante up for yourself when the collection plate passed, but also to buy your forebears out of Purgatory as well. A common person could not find a _Bible_ written in their own language. Dissemination and interpretation of God's Word was up to the Church--and the Church wasn't precisely interested in getting the straight message across. ""Luther"" is beautifully done and illustrates a nice segment of these times for us. It's a thought-provoking film I'm glad today's times have allowed to be made--and for us to view. Strongly recommended for young history classes."
3,Luther,"This movie was just okay, the story was good and very true. I did like Joseph Fiennes performance in the movie."
2,Keep Running,"The story was good up until the end. The family was running for no reason at all when you come to the end. I do not believe this would have happened in real life. For a lawyer, that is not very smart and for a wife to go along with this with her children that is dumb."
3,Half way there.,"It has amazing pictures. I saw some basket hilt designs I had never seen before. The offerings in the modern sword reproduction market for basket hilt swords are very slim compared to the styles that have existed historically.The book is about $100 so it is not cheap. It has numerous pictures on every page. My critique of it is that it only shows the baskets. The should have had two pictures of every sword. One with as close up of the basket and one of the whole sword. Perhaps more pictures where the basket hilt is not symmetrical on both sides. They should also give statistics of the weight, length, point of balance, profile and distill taper measures. Modern sword collectors and practitioners are very acutely aware of the meaning of these statistics and what they mean to performance. The book is written from the museum curator's point of view, not the practicing swordman's. Perhaps a second edition will step up to a more advanced level."
5,¡EXCEPCIONAL!,"This is just amazing! Her voice just bursts out and fills up any unoccupied corner in the room! To me, words just can't explain it..."
3,loose setting,The ring was gorgeous just wish I could of exchanged it instead of having to return it. The setting was loose and the stone wasn't set correctly.
5,Awesome,"This ring is beautiful.It is everything and more.It looks real.I can wear it and not have to worry about losing my Mother's real set.But everyone thinks it's real,more than my Mother's set.So if you are looking for something that will set off your hand,well here it is.The craftmanship is great as well.The stone is set in and will not just fall out.I really love it."
5,Good Movie,This movie was great. I loved it because it was so realistic and I learned a lot from it. I also liked it because it talked about gangsters and I like to watch movies about movies.
5,Riveting,Nuryev's was such a fascinating character & led a very interesting life. The author did an excellent job writing his life account. I can hardly put this book down.
3,go buy the companion,"I picked this up at my school's library(along with 100 Bullets, go figure) and read through in about 20 minutes. Well, gee, that was short. Very Lovecraftian ending, which still intrigues me, and some nice hallucenogenic visuals...but what happened? It was like a short story that didn't feel the need to elaborate on its characters at all, therefore, I don't sympathize with any of them. So yeah, if you want the actual experience of this piece, just forego this 20-minute noir fix and pick up the Companion--which makes little sense to me that it needs a companion when it's but one issue that anyone can manage by themselves.The companion is just under the price of the hardback copy and has not only the script(like I said, why buy the comic?) but more original art, essays, and the references that are practically required for the HPL uninitiated. Interesting little read. I think I just spent half the time reviewing the book that I spent reading it."
2,PUA Book Order (The System),"Small book with somewhat large type, not finished reading it, and not really buying into it yet (maybe too soon to tell).My Amazon purchase included 3-publications (similar ilk). Within a very short time (minutes) of making the online purchase, there was an identity hack against my credit card. Coincidence?I'm reconsidering making future purchases through Amazon."
2,Not to interesting,"I didn't find anything in this book I didn't already know. I would admit I didn't try the methods as I believe they are just as bad as mine haha.If your coming up empty with dating or even if your looking for the love of your life then my highest recommendation goes to the book that helped me find my Fiancee "" How to get the woman of your dreams using the Internet"" The Autor has found out where to look and how to get any person of the opposite sex you want online and shares it with all of us. A homerun for us searching for true love!"
1,Recipe for disaster,"My girlfriends were acting so weird I finally asked one what was going on. She said my boyfriend had been hitting on every woman in our circle. I called my sister to boo-hoo and she said he had tried with her, too.After I kicked him out, my sister and I were turning the mattress and I found this book. My sister said this was the stuff he was trying. We called my girlfriends over to party and we read this silly system out loud. What a hoot! Women can't read a single page without laughing.I found out why my friends were acting so weird. My boyfriend's act was so obvious that my friends thought I must be testing them to see if they would betray me. The Valentine System is so juvenile that every woman who has read it giggles that no one smart enough to read is stupid enough to believe any of this will work.All these rave reviews testify that only dorky men would buy this book. If you need The Valentine System, you need a lot of OTHER things money won't buy."
2,no music,"I expected this to have classical music as does Thompson's CD set ""Brainwave Symphony"". Instead it is simply tones. Not for me."
2,you get what you pay for. zzzzzz....,"CD's with binaural beat technology are a great tool to use in meditation. That being said, not all CD's are the same. ""Dr."" Jeffrey Thompson flaunts his chiropractic degree in the title of his albums, but his background does not lend much skill to his abilities as either a neurologist or music composer. I have both ""Awakened Mind"" and ""Gamma Meditation."" Basically, both of the CD's I purchased from this group are nothing but an endless and monotonous series of tones that cannot hold the attention long enough to acheive the desired affect. I did, however, listen to each album a minimum of five times to give them a fair trial... the effect was minimal compared to other CD's in my collection. Putting one to sleep is not the same as putting one in a meditative state! One extra star, however, for assisting me nicely in meditation while under the influence of alcohol...good listening for drunks?"
4,A very excellent debut for a marvelous series.,"As of this writing, there have been six entries in the Buddha Lounge CD series. This first entry is probably my least favorie of them all but I still enjoy this album plenty. ""Poetry"", ""The Audience"", ""In The Move"", and ""Glass From Jasper"" are among my favorite tracks on this CD. ""Poetry"" has a hypnotic sound that is somewhat difficult to explain in this review but has a beautiful echoing vocal. ""Glass From Jasper"" has a unique chord structure and a entrancing atmosphere. Some of the tracks on this album drag a bit but aren't bad either. This is a good entry in that showed potential. Subsequent entries in my opinion have improved on it since then but this is definately still recommended. Just not quite as strongly like Volume 4 or 6 which are spectacular."
5,Great quality!,"Love how silky smooth this lube feels! A bit difficult to handle since it could stain some clothing, but really easy to clean up."
5,Klassic KISS.,"I've been a KISS fan since 3rd grade, and when I heard this CD I cried. It was great hearing my boys back together again. Even my mom was thrilled!"
1,The WORST album in the whole World!!,"I used to be a Kiss fan but this album is terrible. Ace can't play guitar anymore and Peter never could play drums. I can't believe Paul and Gene fired the two best musicians of Kiss, Mr. Bruce Kulick and Mr. Eric Singer."
2,Heartbroken Kiss Fan,"I don't think anbody in the world was looking more forward to this than me. The songs are hackneyed, with no real hooks or standouts. Can hardly hear Gene on bass - Performances by Ace and Paul's vocals sound good, but it's like a great actor with a bad script. The acting doesn't save it."
2,NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!,THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD JUST GOT A CHINK IN THEIR ARMOUR. THEY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED WHILE THEY WERE ON TOP.MISSING CLASSIC PUNCH. PSYHO CIRCUS GIVES A HIT BUT NOTHING ELSE CAN KEEP UP THE PACE.
3,Welcome to the show? Sort of,This marks the return of the original lineup. 3 1/2stars at best. Better than Destroyer. THis has Kiss's 2 best ever Psycho Circus and Raise your Glasses. Not bad. Still worth getting
2,Another kick in the teeth for Ace & Peter.,"I gotta be honest. I really liked this album until I found out how Ace & Peter were cast aside during recording of it. I've sold my copy of it. At one point KISS became KI$$ corp. They've always been about clever marketing but there was a legitimate feel behind it. I don't know if it's changed or if I just finally started to notice. Whatever the reason, I have no need for this album. Too much fighting among the original members has ruined it for me, too much greed & ego."
4,Better than I hoped,"Kiss said that they wanted to make another Destroyer when they put this album together. I think there is some good songs and some magic was recreated, but it doesn't quite live up to the original albums. Part of it is because they have moved forward in life and changed a but artistically, and also this album seems more like a Gene and Paul collaboration with 1 song thrown to Peter and Ace to make it seem like they had a part in creating the album. Aside from the horrible ""You Wanted the Best"" song, I listen to this all the way through and enjoy it very much. There is a great European 2 disc set that is worth finding since it has 6 live tracks on the second disk. You might also want to find ""In Your Face"", which is a bonus song on the Japanese disk. Not a favorite of mine, but at least it is another Ace song."
2,Disco Track - A good way to ruin a Latin CD,"This is basically a pretty good CD although I agree with other reviewers that it is not as nice as Mi Tierra. However, I do not understand why the producers or Gloria would want to ruin a Latin music CD by placing a very loud DISCO version of ""No me dejes de Querer"" on track 13. When I play this CD, I either have to program that track out or otherwise rush to the volume control when it gets there. I don't understand this at all, it ruins the latin mood completely. I would have rated this 3 or 4 stars if it were not for this."
2,Where's The Carribean Soul?,"Being Puerto Rican, I love to dance the Salsa, meringue, and music that just makes you swing. This latest from my most favorite diva is misleading. The cover of the CD shows her getting it down and dancing. Well, when I popped this cd in I couldn't dance to a single one.Don't let the other reviews here fool you. If you like a lot of s-l-o-w, and I mean s-l-o-w ballads, then hey, I highly recommend this CD. If you're expecting real latin music, than the best picks are Abriendo Puertas (my favorite, because you can dance to all of the tracks) and Mi Terra (Just LOVE Mi Terra!). Gloria is my favorite singer of all time, and I worship her and all, but Gloria, honey, you really let me down on this one."
3,A Little Thrill is Right,"Judging from the title of JE's new CD one would expect to be thrilled. This, of course, doesnt happen right away but it happens not so much from the lyrics though. Lacking lyrically is cool if you compensate which is what JE did for Jagged Little Thrill. The boyz are singing their hearts out on this one. There is just something about the mix, the sound, the feelling they generate. Thats why I like it and thats why I suggest you go out and get it. We can all use a Jagged Little Thrill now and then."
5,Cool Tool!,"This is a pretty cool divot repair tool (not that I have a lot of experience using it...). It's ergonomic, sleek, and nice to have on the course. The ball markers also work well. The tool works well and seems to repair divots nicely."
4,Great for relaxing!,This is a great CD that helps relax the body. I listen to it almost every night and I rarely ever get through the entire CD before I am already asleep. It has great visualization technique and creates positive energy when trying to concieve. I just wish it had a couple of different segments that I could choose from instead of hearing the same one over and over again but I would definetly recommend it:)
2,The Number Does Not Deliver,"Lee Eisenberg's ""The Number"" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted. Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's ""Personal Finance for Dummies"", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person."
2,"Where's the ""beef""?","My hat is off to the author for his timing and marketing. He will surely move closer to his ""number"" with sales of this book. For those of you looking for more than reassurance that you are not alone in the search, don't waste your time and money on this book. Find a good advisor or start studying on your own and save money through whatever retirement plan that you have at your disposal. Finding the ""number"" is not nearly as difficult as having the discipline to save towards reaching it."
4,The Number,"If you are looking for the NUMBER, it is not in this book! Interesting facts and statistic are brought to light throughout the book. The book establishes a scale for one to measure there own retirement comfort level.Overall - A good read."
1,Worst Advice Book in History,"This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life. To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes. Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering. What exactly is this guy's point? No way to tell.Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.I want my money and time back."
1,Save your money and boost your number,I read a magazine summary of the book - a short summary which was non-commital. Then I read the book. The author has no expertise in this realm and the book is filled with lots of his own anecdotes and those from a small circle of people he happens to know. What is disappointing and amazing is the lack of effort to truly interview or survey people. There is no science here or data - just opinions and anecdotes. Very disappointing.
2,You will know very little more after you read this than before,"I guess the book is about the taboo of discussing how much you have in your retirement account. Maybe it's about, as it finally gets to in the end, that there are things more important than a specific number and the idle time pleasures they would bring. But god, is this tedious. Entire chapters recounting the goings on a retirement planning meetings from Weyerhauser.There was a bit of reasonable advice, sprinkled throughout, but little and far between."
1,Chicken Little gets a job as a financial advisor!,"This is ""Chicken Little gets a job as a fiancial advisor."" Lots of what-if, what-if, what-if...but no answers beyond save more money and reduce your expenses in retirement. This book takes you on a never ending quest to find the number...but the only consistent message is that no matter how much you manage to save or think you need...it will not be enough.In the last paragraph Eisenberg says ""Better to invest this valuable energy, and use that time, to come to terms with who you are, or, if it better pleases you, to make more money."" I suggest you take his advice. If you've read more than 3 or 4 of these reviews then you have already wasted too much time on this book.Why doesn't Amazon have a ""zero star"" option?"
1,Wish I had read the reviews first!,"Now having scanned the reviews here, I wish I had read them before getting this book. This book is rambling...and I really, really mean rambling. It's like talking with a neighbor and hearing his opinion. In this case, having read about 200 pages worth of his opinions, this is a neighbor you would have tuned out after the first 15 minutes. What's Your Number? I don't freakin' have one man! I am trying to figure out how to make the most out of what I have and enjoy life more. This book didn't provide a lick of useful advice for that."
3,Fast Forward to Disc5 Section 24-end,"I listened to the 5CD set on a recent road trip and found The Number entertaining but only informative on 2 points: the existence of super wealthy ""family offices"" and the section of how to arrive at the actual number found on the last CD 5 section 24 through the end. The rest was repetitive at moments but often funny. The author did make me stop and reconsider retiring early and put the entire subject into perspective. Hang with it, even if at times he seems to be on a tangent off subject. It's actually valuable info. as the cover advises to listen to this before consulting an advisor to better understand your definition of your number. I would have given 4 stars if not for the intermittent clicking of the reader's gums or dentures as well as the over emphasis on the number angst of the upper middle class to upper class."
1,"rambling, disorganized, pabble","The Number is written by Lee Eisenberg, formerly with Esquire magazine who moved his family to Wisconsin after getting a job offer from Lands' End to be their Creative Director. From his own experience and informal interviews with acquaintances, Eisenberg developed this entire book largely around how much people need or think that they need to retire (the Number).Be warned that the author has no experience or expertise as a financial or counseling practitioner and the book, financially speaking, is quite narrow in scope. It doesn't deal with the vast array of financial challenges and obstacles that most people face.Eisenberg worries readers with dire warnings about Social Security drying up and the undependable stock market, which can halve in value as it did in the early 2000s. I doubt most readers will find this book useful or enlightening."
3,The second half of the book is worth reading.,"I found the first half or so of this book pretty worthless. General information abounds - save more, you'll need it, etc. etc. Nothing new here.The author does, towards the latter part of the book, make some good points about each of us having to decide what is really important to us in terms of what kind of lifestyle, etc., might make us happy in the later part of our lives. How much money you need (The Number, as it were) is dependant upon how much YOU need to do what YOU want to do. So it does bring up some important issues. But it is no ""how to"" for retirement."
5,"fun, fun, fun","at first i was disappointed, because the characters are completely different than the last three SSX games. but the more i play it, the more i like it. i love the variety of courses, way more than the last three (or at least it seems that way)."
4,ssx on tour vs ssx 3,compare ssx 3 it has same feature but serious lacking some fun that ssx 3 for example it harder to turn and little slower in speed compare to ssx 3. it a few step behind ssx 3 but still fun to play and the print is hard to read on ssx on tour
2,Hexagonal Frame for Sandbox-dissappointed!,Poor quality. The clips rip off when trying to tighten after one try. I have had to tie the ropes together for it to work. Will send it back ASAP!
3,April Morning,"This book was very well written at a critical point. It had alot of meaning in it. Moses was always meaningful. He would alwaysact mean to Adam, but he would love him more than anythingelse... everyone would be sad and terrified because of the British,and all of it is described very well. Personqally, I don't reallylike books like this, but some people like depression books like thisbecause the books are well written. In conclusion, this book wouldonly be a good read to like very meaningful books."
3,"It's well-written, but not one of my favorites","I was assigned this book for school. It was one of the better books that we have been assigned to read, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed other books. I felt that this book was well-written and it wasn't terrible to read, but it didn't really make me want to keep reading. Adam's character was very relatable though. I think that it was because he was around my age and he went trough some of the same problems as people our age go through. Such as his relationship problems with Ruth. All in all, I feel that this book was okay, if you like historical books. I personally do not."
4,Great Book!,"I was reluctant on reading this book at first because of its genre (historical fiction). The book started off slow, but sped up during the second chapter. I loved this book. It taught me many things and I will always remember it"
3,Fast's sorta Slllooowww book,"I found that this book tought me alot about the war and the people back then, but it was extremely descriptive and detailed. I dont think that talking for 2 pages about ""interpretation of dreams"" had too much to do with the story, but that's just my opinion. But besides this, the story was pretty good, and very suspensful."
4,April morning,"I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 because it was a little slow paced at the beginning. Like in the first part of the story they just introduce main characters and tell you who does what. The next parts are very exciting like, when Adam and the father have to go to the common (field) for important information from a distant rider. Some parts in the book are very sad that I do not want to give away. This book you sould think about reading, Howard Fast makes it very suspensful at times.I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I do,----Jake----"
4,vaughn's review for April Morning,I think that Howard Fast's April Morning was very well writen and that if anyone who has the chance should read this book. The book was a rude awaking for what happen on that day and it tells us all what was going through the minds of everyone. In our history books it is just boing fact after boring fact but in this but it is kind of like a fun history lesson. The book was boring at first but once you got to know the characters it started to get interresting. I personally liked young Adam Cooper the best because when it came down to it he did what had to be done to stay alive. And anyone can respect that. April Morning was one of the only books that I have read cover to cover because i was interested with it. I think if you are stuck between reading this book or another one you should diffently read this books.
1,BORING,"This is the most boring book I have ever attemped to read. I'm supposed to read it in my English class, and I can't even get past page 30 because it's so boring. It's very complicated too, and makes absolutely no sense to me. I think you have to really be interested in history to like and understand this book. To me, it's highly boring and pointless. It goes on and on about the littlest things, and goes into detail about bread! Plus, the words are hard to understand."
1,One star is more than enough,"The book April Morning was required reading for my eighth grade reading class. As I read this book I liked it less and less. I found the it to be boring and pointless. It uses language and content meant for a more adult audience, yet is written in a style a fourth grader should be able to read. Furthermore I did not think the author did a good job in writng it. He has no substantial plot or interesting dialouges. Because of the lack of creativity and talent Fast uses gore and foul language to attract his audience. A book read in school should be one that relate to the reader and is creativly styled and worded, rather than nothing more than a trashy novel."
1,Too Hard To Read,"First, the reason of the book, I think, was to teach young kids tabout the Revolutionary War and how it started.I think it did not do a good job keeping you into it, but if it had been a textbook it would have gotten the point across.Second, the book can just go on and on about nothing to important,like what kind of ingrediant is most used in a dessert. If you wanted to read this book on your own time,you would get more sleep done than the book. If your a teacher it would be an okay choice to use as a learning book, though the novel can get totally off topic and really just dumb."
2,Yeeuk!,"I was forced to read this book for English, and It was not at all as good as the usual high quality books our English teacher has us read. The only plus to the book is that it is realistic. Adam Cooper was very relatable. Otherwise it was very boring. If you are at a 9th grade reading level or higher, I don't think that this book is for you."
4,Book Review by a Special Person,"I believe that April Morning was a pretty good novel. The book got off to a slow start and I thought that it would be boring. Once the Redcoats arrive the plot picks up pace. I loved how descriptive Howard Fasts writing is and how he makes you feel like you are right there in the middle of the battle of Lexington and Concord. I like how this novel puts a new twist on history. The reader is able to see the the horrors of war and how many lives it touched. Your everyday history books do not describe how tramatic it was for the common people to see there peaceful towns in ruins. I would recomend this novel to people who enjoy reading historical fiction, because if you do not like reading these kind of books this would not be a good novel for you to read. In my opinion April Morning is a good book."
1,oh how the mighty have fallen,"The original Eloise was a sustained thrill. I have avoided all sequels until now for fear of just this sort of crashing disappointment. Think of the difference between Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II, then multiply by ten. It is a bore. It is an embarassment. It is rawther godawful."
3,AVERAGE JOE IS STILL BETTER THAN 90% OF WHAT'S OUT THERE,"OK, so this isn't ""Night And Day,"" but it is still a fine listen. I love the way Joe has re-interpreted his songs over the years in the live setting. Who wants to hear the same songs played live, note-for-note, anyway? That has always been my criticism of live albums, in general. For me, the only song that doesn't benefit from this 'trio' treatment is ""Down to London."" I wish I had been to this show. The playing is tight, and I can close my eyes and imagine that I'm there. When Joe does a live album, or when you see him perform live, it's always a fresh experience. I enjoyed his ""Symphony No. 1"" as well, but it's not the kind of disc that stands up to repeated listens the way a pop disc does. I think all Joe fans would agree that even 'Average Joe' is still better that 90% of everything else that is out there."
2,"SOUNDS LIKE JOE, TRYING TO SOUND LIKE JOE","This is the crux Joe is at now. He can't quite achieve the dynamic energy level he once had when he performed these songs on a regular basis. And it seems no one has told him this yet. The result is a mixed bag of familiar tunes, with Joe sounding a bit unconvinced about material he once sang so...convincingly. While the playing is fairly tight, and Joe does show flashes of the old Joe here and there, this is still for me, an unsatisfying album."
4,Joe knows live.,"I'll probably never forget the day I went looking for this album. My wife had been brought in to a local hospital so that they could induce labor on her. It wouldn't be until the next day that my daughter would be born, but I was enjoying every minute of Joe live the previous evening while I sat next to my wife's hospital bed (she didn't mind since there were headphones and all). ""Another World"", ""Fools in Love"", and ""Down to London"" (one of my favorite JJ tunes), are all great. Steely Dan's ""King of the World"" and ""You Can't Get What You Want"" from the Body and Soul album are delightful as well. It may not be 1986's ""Big World"" (a great live album), but this is good stuff."
1,Worst Civ Pro text ever made,"This book is not worth the paper it is printed on. Yeazell is another author who sells an un-answered book just so he can sell another book that explains the first one. Civ Pro is hard enough without having to blow $300 just to understand the class textbook. If your civ pro class uses this book, RUN! Switch to another class or buy all the supplements you can that are by other authors."
5,A good casebook on all points.,"This was my favorite casebook of my 1L classes. I have no complaints about it. Things I like: Plain English writing style, use of modern cases (Internet, etc.), extensive use of hypos as questions after cases, thought-provoking and difficult questions - many of them with answers or hints. If you can do these, you'll be prepared for whatever issues appear on exams."
4,It's the real deal,"This is not a knock-off. So far it's working fine. Takes about 2 hours for the lava to really flow but other than that, no complaints. I've been faithful about leaving it on for no more than 8 hours at a time (give or take a little) so it's still working OK.I would give it 5 stars if it didn't take so long to get going. With the 8 hour operational time limit, that only leaves 6 hours of oozing fun."
4,nice light,"this light is wicked , only took 2 day to get over here , i love it , the color is so cool, its the lamp to get"
5,Great item,"My son wanted a lava lamp and this one is perfect. Easy assembly and easy to use. Gets warm, but doesn't overheat. Good buy."
2,Slow motion-no motion Lava lamp,"I am disappointed in this lava lamp. After waiting for nearly eight hours for the 'lava' to start moving, it finally made a slight move upward. That was it. The lamp makes a nice night light but it is NOT a lava lamp. More like an oil-filled glass container with a blob of wax stuck at the bottom.Do not waste your money on this product. You would be better off going to Spencer's."
5,beautiful lava lamp,"I was worried about buying a lava lamp because of mixed reviews, but I'm glad I did. This one is beautiful and works very well. My husband and I turn it on every evening and at least a few times, we go, ""wow, look at it now."" I highly recommend it."
2,Bad sound - no bass,"The sound quality is so bad...especially when volume level is increased...no equalizer options so can't adjust the bass, treble etc.,No holes to hang somewhere....poor design so it just rolls out if I try to place in a table....And it looks like eyes of some alien from mars....so bright blue light, disturbing eyes at night...pluses are quick delivery and cheap cost....I am using it to hear audio books...(and for music I bought an some other product).....Best option is to put some +20$ and go for some popular + good speakers available in the market...If you want to hear good music with decent bass + treble + balance...it is not worth..."
3,good but not great,"For it's size, the sound quality really wasn't that impressive. I know that good quality sound isn't to be expected of small speakers, but I've seen tons of smaller speakers with the same (poor) quality sound as this chunky thing. It wasn't even that light in weight either. The sound was just really flat...not much better than my laptop's speaker, in fact. The only ""up-side"" to this thing is only probably the volume."
2,Disappointing,"Like the first reviewer I was greatly enjoying this novel about Ella. It's remarkable ..and then at the very end he ruins it with what can only be called gratuitous tasteless bizarreness that didn't even sound like the same writer....the spell was shattered and I can't guess why....it achieved nothing and harmed the book...imo. If he had afforded Ella the dignity of her death that we know took place ....it would be a better known book..as it is, it almost goes into SiFi"
5,map puzzle,"I bought this puzzle for my classroom of 4th through 6th graders. I received a puzzle like this when I was 11 years old, and was one of the few kids who really knew the USA! My students have that reputation as well. When most schools teach NOTHING about the states or their relation with each other (I know, none of my own children learned anything about this in school.), a child who plays with this puzzle will learn their USA having fun. It is the only US puzzle, to my knowledge, that has all the states cut individually. Most puzzles clump the small New England states together, which does a disservice to the children."
1,tt,this is supposed to be able to pick up 8 octaves. it hardly picks up four. i was extremely dissapointed. i have used way cheaper tuners that work as well or better. this thing is not worth your money.
4,good tuner,"Good product. Would like to have a rubber case (like the peterson tuners) instead of plastic (which will break very easily if dropped). Pricey for the quality. Needs to be a better made tuner for the price. But, it works well. The thing I like most is, it tells me which octave I am tuning. This was the main reason for purchase of this tuner."
3,Déception,Acheteur franais j'ai d payer des frais dedouanne 34 euros pour obtenir le produit ce qui n'était pas annoncé sur la commande.J'aurais payé 40 euros moins cher par amazon FranceJe suis déu par le Korg OT 120 qui ne couvre pas leshuit octaves annoncés et ne permet pas d'accorder les cordes basses et les cordes aigües d'un piano.
2,Amateur totally unprofessional home video,"Amateur totally unprofessional home video, sloppy production.Strikes against this video are as follows:Amateur video production.poor sound qualitypoor close ups of foot workcamera bounces around so much I got dizzynonprofessional dance teammistakes are NOT edited out.the small Blue room, blue walls, blue floors, and blue ceilings make one feel closed in.Apparently, this group of dancers are the people of a local synagogue and they are just having fun - as they do on Shabbat. They are just - well, regular folks - all ages.Pros:Kids can learn most of the circle dances.They do cover lots of different dance steps in real time and slow motion.It has a good running time of 90 minutesBottom line: If you can look past the amature production and just work on the steps and if youcan get it for half the price, it would be worth it."
2,Better Than Battlefield Earth,"A friend gave me this book knowing how little I thought of Battlefield Earth (Book & Movie). My biggest mistake was seeing the Battlefield Earth movie, despite reading the book.A Small Percentage was as predictable as Battlefield Earth, War of the Worlds, Santa vs. the Martians, and Independence Day. Mankind will prevail despite odds and technology.A Small Percentage did show the kind side of the aliens (Jenny) and the humans (Clay)"
2,Better products out there!,"The tools provided in this kit is adequate, however unnecessary, as you can get those in any medicine cabinet at home. The actual frost fighter product is what really upset me. When I opened the bottle it was only 1/4 filled and it wasn't as liquid as it was supposed to be. It was like 1 year old left over paint, most of it was stuck to the cotton swab with the first dip I made.There are other CHEAPER products out there. Don't buy this one! I would return it but, all the solution is on the cotton swab!"
2,"Some interesting old film clips, but not all that funny, I thought","Perhaps my sense of humor has changed over the years. I found it kind of interesting, but didn't find it all that funny. Not a strong collection of comedy, sorry to say."
5,evergreen,THE COCKTAIL PARTY is a very good play. As a matter of fact it is a real joy listening to it and following the text. Every time I do I discover some new meaning in this great masterpiece. I am very happy with it.G. Martini
1,Warning! - my edition was unreadable (literally!),"This book has been re-printed, but (in the copy I received, I can't speak for all of them) nearly all of the text was totally scrambled thanks to some amazing errors with the fonts and typesetting. The Old Icelandic texts were completely unreadable and I have returned my copy to Amazon, who have granted me a full refund. This is extremely disappointing as I had intially been delighted to find that this work had been made available. I sincerely hope that my experience was unusual, and that others have not been similarly let down by shoddy workmanship! Buy with extreme caution..."
3,Teachable Moment,"We love Froggy books. We have them all. However, I was surprised to see Froggy ""back-talking"" his mother and telling her what needed to be done before he'd actually go to sleep. Since we already had the book, I chose to use this to teach my daughter that Froggy is wrong to talk back to his mother. We talked about how long it was taking Froggy and how this was respecting his mother when she told him to go to sleep. Ok book but lessons are endless."
4,One of my favorites,"It's been almost four decades since I read this book, but still whenever some particulary heinous episode of human idiocy appears in the news, my mind throws out a mental footnote quoting the teenaged hero's passionate defense of humanity before an interstellar tribunal deciding whether to wipe away Earth. Depsite the hokey title and its ""juvenile"" status, it has lots to offer."
4,"Good science fiction, but dated.","This is a good science fiction book, but it is dated. Quite a bit of the science pokes its head through the literature, which is nice but occasionally its age (40 +)shows when describing society such as a drug store with malts! Once you get past that, the book is fairly good for the young teenager."
5,MASTERPIECE.....,"If you are the type of person who likes to explore different types of music, THIS is a highly recommended record, imagine a living jazz legend (TONY SCOTT) living in Japan in the 60's and getting all the ZEN atmosphere, at the same time he met zen musicians, and this is the result : a 65 minute improvisation, it is known as the first NEW AGE recording.please... ENJOY"
3,"Read ""The Shout""; skip the rest; stick to other writings of Graves","""The Shout,"" in this collection, may be the finest short story I have ever read. It makes the book worth buying. But the rest of the stories in this book never held my attention. They are not poorly written; they are simply not very interesting. Graves's poetry, autobiography, translations, and many of his novels are generally far superior to anything here, except for ""The Shout."" Short story writing, whether fiction or nonfiction, just does not seem to have been Graves's dish of tea."
3,Fun Teen Movie,Watched with my 12 year old daughter and she thought it was good. Watched it for a couple of times.
1,The worst movie ever that didn't have the Spice Girls in it.,"I have seen this movie three times (against my wishes) and it just kept getting worse and worse with each viewing. This movie completely, totally, utterly su**s. The pathetic attempts at comedy work for the film's first thirty seconds before becoming unbelievably boring and stupid. Not only are the jokes (if you can call them that) not funny, but they beat you over the head trying to make you laugh so hard when all you really want to do is burn the VCR (or DVD or whatever the hell you're watching this on). Trey Parker and Matt Stone should forget about acting ever again and stick with making construction paper swear, and watching Jenny McCarthy try to act is just about the only thing worth laughing at here. Seeing Ernest Borgnine and Robert Stack in a movie this crappy turns my stomach. I really can't say enough bad things about it, but if I have to sum it up, Baseketball f***ing blows."
2,Occasionally funny......mostly boring,"South Park is fantastic. Orgazmo is a truly entertaining movie. Trey and Matt are obviously pretty smart and funny. But Baseketball is not really very good at all. In fact, it made me cringe often to see so many celebrity cameos that just fall completely flat. I'm sure they tried very hard to make this work, but it just doesn't. Watch Orgazmo instead."
4,"Quirky, Hilarious Comedy from South Park Creators","""Baseketball"" had me laughing the whole time, even if not a truly rememberable plot. The ""Unsolved Mysteries"" scene is probably the funniest single cut I've ever witnessed in a comedy."
1,"The Worst DVD, period","The movie was funny at times. The DVD is horrible. There is nothing ""extra"" about it. The VHS version has more ""extras"" than the DVD.Huh?Avoid this like the plague."
2,Not everyone's cup of tea.,"While there were a few key moments of humor, for the most part it felt like a whole lot of vulgarity and tired old cliches. I can only assume that if your sense of humor is geared towards Southpark or Airplane, then you'd probably like this movie as other posters have said. I gave it a chance and it was a total letdown for me."
3,PHOTOROMAN,"Remember those illustrated novellas that our mothers used to enjoy reading.You had the spoiled girl who had an affair with an older man.Usually,she meets a younger man who is less fortunate.The woman to make ends meet gets a job in a library,but it doesn't take long for her to be bored and she returns to the older man who brings her security.This is basically the story of LA CHAMADE.CATHERINE DENEUVE was 25 at the time and she was indeed gorgeous,but that is not enough to save a film that is so predictable.My favorite scene is the one at the airport when LUCILLE is waiting for CHARLES and gets annoyed by another man.She says to him :fichez-moi la paix!If you buy this for the bonus features,don't bother,they did not include a photo gallery of DENEUVE."
2,Mediocre Deneuve,"Just a so, so film. Would I watch it more than once...yes...but not more than twice. When Deneuve is at her best, she is magic....this is not it. Why...story seems trite to me...not interesting."
1,A Mess,"If you're in the mood for a film arranged around the relentless, overenunciated narration of a surpassingly bland main character, ""Watch Out"" is the film for you. I beg everyone else looking for the kind of shocks and outrageousness behind this film's advertising campaign not to make the mistake I did -- put on a blindfold and pick out anything by Russ Meyer, Herschell Gordon Lewis or Guy Maddin and count your blessings."
3,"It's Okay, barely. Schumacher SE-3000 Manual Fleet Battery Charger","Charger is functional in 6, 12, and 24 volts. Will do lite duty charging. The cables are very lite duty, so be careful if you are charging high amps in 12 volts or using 24 volts. The case is very lite duty also, even though it was packaged well, it was dented but did not affect use. I kept it as it was minor and I figured it would eventually get bumps and scrapes during use. In my opinion not a ""fleet"" quality charger. I will get by as I am using it as a backup second charger. Bottom line: You get what you pay for. It was about half price of a ""fleet"" quality charger."
2,What does good mean?,"The book was rated as 'good' quality in the advertisement, but when it arrived the cover immediately fell off."
5,Dark Canyon,A classic western with the author's usual flair. All of the Lamour books are top notch and this is no exception. Great read
5,Still A Classic,"One of those books I always meant to read, and this superb audio edition shows why it is and will remain a classic. Cherry Jones delivers an subtly understated but spot-on performance with her narration, and the story of how the young girl's imagination entwines her life with that of the deaf-mute boarder is both touching and enlightening.The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter"
4,A different kind of Gothic,"This is a great, though dark, story. I read this as a college English assignment, and found it much more enjoyable than I expected. The course was American Gothic, and though Gothic conjures up images of dark, dank, spooky and frightening, this story is one more of stifling futility. It presents a good historical perspective on the thoughts and ideas of the 30's (the rise of Socialism). Yet, it really does have a contemporary feel to it. This is a worthwhile read."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book BEATIFULL, FUNNY and DRAMATIC all at the same time. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,So so,"I read this book because it was mentioned and held in very high regard in the book I just finished Off Magazine Street. Although it was very well written, it's definitely not for everyone and it made me feel as though I was reading it for a class. It was a struggle at times. I appreciated it, but would not recommend it."
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star,"I don't understand how people found this book excellent and interesting. But then again some people might not understand how I found this book totally boring, uninteresting and depressing. This book is far from a Classic and deserves NO STARS."
5,"My personal favorite, and I'm in high school!","I am a high school senior and despite all the negative feedback from other young people, I loved this book. This book had been sitting on my mom's bookcase for as long as I can remember, and the title had always caught my eye. Finally, one day last week I picked it up and started reading. From the first page, I was hooked. I read it in only 4 days. It's too bad that other teenagers can't appreciate this incredibly moving novel. It is without question one of my favorite novels ever."
1,Slow & boring book....,"I was excited to finally join ""Oprah's Book Club"" and start by reading this book. As I read along and got encouraging emails from Oprah, I kept wondering when the long, cumbersome details of each character would end and some sort of interesting plot would develop. When I read the end of p. 359 the boring descriptions finally ended. Unfortunately, it was the last page of the book!!!I did get the point of the book, that we are all more the same than we realize or want to acknowledge....BUT...Overall, I felt that this storyline moved very slow and wasn't very interesting.I'm hoping that the next book club selection is better than this one."
2,It sucked!,"I had to read this book for school. It was rather boring. The only parts I liked was about Mick Kelly, and nothing ever even happend to her. But, it is easy to trace the pattern of lonliness throughout the book. Anyway, if you are reading it for fun, you've got to be REAL BORED!!!"
1,For those who like to appear well read,"In the grand list of books that you will have enjoyed having read, this one ranks slightly above ""Tom and Jane Go to Camp"".Now, I'm not going to say that this book was trite, boring, lacking in substance or otherwise devoid of anything resembling redeeming merit, because it does have its purpose. That purpose being to sit on your shelf and make it appear as though you are some kind of eruditic masochist.If, like me, you were forced to read this book as some sophomore hazing ritual, you will no doubt remember that this book contains very little in the way of plot and character development. The characters don't so much grow as fester.I would not recommend this book to anybody, even those that I hate. People who have suicidal tendencies are warned to stay away as the most cheery portion of this book is slightly happier than a crushed puppy.In closing, let me just summarize: this book is bad."
3,deprimente y pesado,"este libro es muy deprimente y ademas muy pesado de leer, no es tan largo, pero da la sensacion de que nunca vas a acabar y cuando terminas te quedas preguntandote que has leido. no se porque se dice que es tan bueno y en donde radica la grandeza de este libro, si quieres un retrato de la soledad extrema, solo tienes que leer crimen y castigo de dostoyesvky o el extranjero de camus, en esos encuentras dos tipos de soledad,, pero esta autora no me convence.LUIS MENDEZcrazzyteacher@hotmail.com"
1,Overnight Shipping -- what a rip off!,"Don't believe Amazon when they say you can have overnight shipping. MY daughter could not find a book for school, so I ordered it from Amazon.com. I paid more for shipping two copies of the book, so I could read it too, than I did on the two books. We are at 1 week past the day I ordered the books and they still have not shown up. My daughter has since driven 25 miles away to another bookstore, purchased the book and finished it. Two days I ago, I put in a request to stop the shipping and was told it was too late. This is ridiculous!"
1,Missing pages,I just received my book in new condition. I opened the book to find that the first page is page 25 ! WTH !
4,JBC,"I am not sure why all the hype about this book. It is well written, but I certainly would not classify it as one of the classics."
4,Very Detailed and Unique,"Overall I liked The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. It started out kind of slow but got better towards the end. It was kinda shocking at some parts, but that was what made the book enjoyable. I was surprised that everyone seemed to revolve around Singer. I thought Mick would be the main character. After I was finished with the book, I sat back and thought about all the troubles and feeling of isolation that all the characters had to go through. All in all, I thought it was pretty good."
3,Shades of gray,"This book deals with life in shades of gray, and my feelings about this book are also in shades of gray. Carson McCullers tackles issues that were prominent in the 1930's, including socialism, poverty, and racism. The writing is excellent, but I found this book dreary. Pretty much, it is about disappointment in life. If a positive message was tucked in, I couldn't glean it. It was hard to read - I would put it down and avoid picking it back up. The author did a good job of drawing her characters in an interesting way, and at a book club we had a lively and riveting discussion on the meaning of the deaf-mute character. I have thought about this book a lot since finishing it - a characteristic that I usually consider the mark of a great book. Nevertheless, I wouldn't recommend it to just any casual reader."
2,for teen-age girls only,"this is one of those books picked by people who still wish they were young. it is a good book for prepubescent or teen-age girls and not for anyone else. there are lots of these floating around, after all this one is over 60. they should normally quietly fade away, till someone unearths the moldy carcass for it to rise again, and quickly sink into the oblivion from which it came"
4,Choose the moment and enjoy...,"This is the first McCullers' book that I have read. It felt like a timeless story that could have been written only yesterday instead of in the 1930's. It also could have been written by a much older, experienced person instead of a young girl of 23 years. It is a gentle, sad story that might have been typical of small town life. It was very refreshing to feel submerged in the slow pace and emotion of life in a long gone era. The story touched me in an unexpected way, and I know I will long remember the characters and their individual stories. Timing is everything when making the choice to read this wonderful book."
1,THIS ITEM IS A PIECE OF JUNK!,Don't waste your money. It is completely worthless. The cage is so flimsy that the water bottle does not stay put. Spend the extra couple of bucks and buy a cage that actually does its job.
1,Too bad I can't rate 0 stars,"It's very disheartening for a child that asks Santa for a guitar and spends the pre-Christmas season excited for Christmas morning, only to open this gift and discover that you can't even tighten the strings to play a tune - they self loosen. This will be going back as soon as I receive my RMA from the manufacturer. Of course, I now have to pay shipping just to send the defective thing back. If you're considering purchase of this product, please - reconsider."
2,Not worth much,"Yes, this guitar is adorable, but that's about the only positive thing that can be said. One string broke while I was trying to tighten it (and no I wasn't over-stressing it). Another broke the first time my son touched it. Most of them would not tighten at all (like the screws were stripped and wouldn't hold). The bridge at the bottom came off the first day as well. So, yes, it's adorable, but... the strap is fine, the carrying case is allright, the tuning pitch is fun, but the guitar itself is very much useless other than pure looks. I certainly was not expecting high quality music to come forth from it, but I was expecting some type of musical note and not just loose strings dangling."
5,Excellent Album!,"I fell in love with this album at the first listen! True, it doesn't contain as many grabby singles as Bringing Down the Horse, but the album still rocks, and overall, the lyrics and music are of a much higher quality. It's so much more introspective than Bringing Down the Horse (which I still love), but which contains a lot of cheery and inscrutable music. The Wallflowers are such a classy band, at a time when we're being deluged by thoughtless teenybopper music. I really hope people will appreciate this intelligent new album!"
5,Amazing Amazing Album,"In a time of bubble gum pop like N sync,Backstreet Boys,Britney Spears and other so called ""artists"" there are few bands still brave enough to say something. The Wallflowers are one of those bands. The lyrics on this album are amazing. The vocal quality is amazing. The bands' playing is amazing. I am completely unable to find anything wrong with this album. People seem to really like Bringing down the Horse. I like Bringing Down The Horse a lot and the songs are really good some of them outstanding like Invisible City and Josephine and I wish I felt Nothing but there isn't near as much emotion on BDTH as there is on Breach. Breach is practically made up entirely of pure emotion coming from Jakob. The brilliance Jakob shows on this album can only be compared to that of one person and I don't even think I need to say his name."
4,Great. But a departure,"I think this album is great, but I'm puzzled as to why it is considered such a huge departure from their last album. The lyrics are slightly more interesting and the melodies slightly less pop, which seems like a band maturing right on schedule. Still, this isn't setting my world on fire."
4,"Wallflowers Back & better than before, actually scratch that","As a avid Wallflower fan since 1996, I was a little dissapointed in this album. While, I do enjoy it, the tracks took me while to get used to. They aren't as catchy as Bringing Down The Horse, but do have some liking. I like slower songs sometimes, and this album does have a lot of them. But don't get me wrong, it is still a GREAT album. Anything these guys do is great. Just dont go into it expecting another Bringing Down The Horse. Reccomended Tracks: 3-Sleepwalker * 5-Witness * 9-Murder101 * 2-Hand Me Down"
3,"When compared to any other PJ CD, not very good","There isn't a lot of good music out there today, and what good music there is stays underground or gets minimal airtime. Pearl Jam is one of, if not the best band of the 90's and I think everyone of their albums excpet for this one is a 5-star album. I realize they have the addition of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, but the drums are not much better than they were when Jack Irons was at drums, if at all. Besides that, this album is just lacking of new sounds or any inspiring sounds at all. This is very uncharecteristic of Pearl Jam. Light Years and Of the Girl are above average songs, and a good lsitens, but the rest of this album is very average. When compared to most mainstream music today, this album is good. But when compared to the other Pearl Jam Cd's, this album is bad. If your going to buy a Pearl Jam album, this should be the last one you buy."
4,Worthy Addition,"This CD is a deserving member of any Pearl Jam fan's music collection. It challenged me, like many of their previous offerings, to listen beyond my expectations and be open to a new experience. After several spins, my review is that Binaural is a very good new experience indeed. The band's music and lyrics have come together in a novel way and made me think about what they've written. And I appreciate provocative entertainment, especially when it's genuine. I recommend it whole-heartedly."
5,Mature Music,"Binaural is a very polished No Code. This album is what No Code should've been. Very consistent and precise. There is a raw, but clear and amazing sound. The album has two sides, the low-key spiritual songs and the heavy hitting quicks songs. The latter include ""Rival"", ""Greivence"", ""Gods Dice"", ""Insignificance"", ""Evacuation"", and ""Breakerfall"". The more spiritual songs like ""Thin Air""(best song on the album), ""Parting Ways"", ""Of the Girl"", ""Nothing as it Seems"" are truly innovative. You will get the maximum listening experience from this album through headphones. Binaural is raw, edgy, creative, and groundbreaking."
1,not a big fan of pearl jams new material,"i know im probably the only 1 star review so im gonna get bashed but i simply do not like this album. i wasnt a fan of no code or yield either and if you dont like those albums you wont like binarual. i was a big fan of ten and v.s but i just dont like the new pearl jam sound. no i am not a kornfan or kidrock posuer im more on the hardrock/metal side (metallica, nirvana) but i have one ? for pearl jam fans- what would be so bad about another album like ten? it has great guitar solos as shown in alive and emotional songs like black. to me binarual is just simply boring. breakerfall and insignifigance are pretty good but to me the rest of the songs fail to delvier. nothing as it seems makes me fall asleep and soon forgot, well eddie vedder plays a ukule. but if your not a fan of the new pearl jam do not buy this album. youll wish you never did"
4,Pearl Floyd,"Can't you just hear the influence in Nothing As It Seems? Sounds like something from Pink Floyd's Animals period. Also, Rival has a very strong Roger Waters influence in the vocal presentation. The main vocal is backed by a an angst ridden, almost screaming backup of the same lyric a la much of Final Cut or Pros and Cons. A tight album that deserves credit for what it is, not what you wished it was going to be"
2,worst pj album,"Pearl Jam really dissapointed me with this CD. There's really not any great songs on the album, maybe a few that are listenable, but none worth mentioning. Even if you are a die hard pearl jam fan, dont waste the money on thisn."
4,Sell out??? NEVER!!!!,"Pure rock n' roll. It's so obvious Pearl Jam is far out grown the stage diving, mosh pit, and flannel years. They're a classic band and this album proves it. If you're expecting to hear ""Alive"" or ""EvenFlow"" well, you won't hear it. I'm tired of people saying Pearl Jam has lost it, well it's been 10 years and they're still around so maybe it's just that people haven't grown like the band. I won't break down every single song but once you listen to ""Of the Girl"" you'll realize Pearl Jam is and always will be in it for the music. At first I thought this CD was okay at best. But it grows on you. If you appreciate just pure music and songs that mean something than Binural is your album. If you haven't grown up and are still listening to hair bands, please don't buy this CD. Better yet, don't ever think about Pearl Jam."
4,Very Pleased PJ Fan,"I have been a die hard Pearl Jam fan ever since Ten was put on the shelves. I am very pleased with Binaural. After having No Code and Yield making many Pearl Jam fans displeased, Binaural takes a quick trip back to the Ten and Versus days. The first two tracks, Breakerfall, and God's Dice, sounds like tracks off of versus.. fast, heavy, and great singing. There are many great songs that you can listen to over and over, but of course with every album, there are a few you will skip right over."
2,All Show,"Who the hell am I except someone who spends good hard earned money on CD's. Most times I can live with it but this one really took the cake. If you are a Pearl Jam fan (And I am one) you cannot help but be disappointed by this recording. There is nothing on it that even reminds us why this band was so good to begin with. Those who say that this is an evolution of Pearl Jam and it is a good thing should listen to Jim Morrison and try to see if it reminds them of anything he was recording when he was on drugs. (No disrespect to Mr. Morrison; I'm a fan of the Door's also). People should save their money on this one and look foreward to their next release, I'm sure it has to be better. Sorry guys but on this one you stink."
2,Same Old Same,"I Used to think that Pearl Jam would Come Out&Change their Music especially after Kurt Cobain Dissed them&Especially after Stone Temple Pilot made a Career Emulating them? well I was Wrong.The Lyrics&Music are as Predictable Now as they were 8 years back.Pearl Jam is Very Corperate they are on the same Label as The KING OF POP MICHAEL JACKSON,SADE,Celine Dion,etc... their Music&Image is very Manufactured.They Need too Either Break Up or do something Completely Different they are Long Overdue.Having Listened too many of their Albums I've Never Gotten what the Hype was about."
3,About Par for Pearl Jam,"to sum it up as quickly as possible....A few songs at the beginning of the album that almost put me to sleep, getting stronger as the album goes on, but not what I was hoping for. If you love Ten, and think Pearl Jam has been sliding downhill since then, than you will get exactly what you are expecting with this album."
3,"Well, Its Called Writer's Block...","First, I love PJ. Always will. Next, this album lets us know that Eddie still is not happy on a basic level. To me, the last insert in the booklet, 'Writer's Block', is evidence of this. The angst is there, searching for inspiration. At one far end of the spectrum, Its my feel as though Eddie is punishing his record label with low sales, but my real take on this album is uninspiration. Guess I'll leave it at that. Bear with them..."
3,i miss pearl jam,"I just got the new cd and I'm betting thier be a lot of reveiws with words like mature ,growing, evolving, which is what this cd is I like it its has an intensity that is subtle but grabs you . The biggest problem is that i'm a pearl jam fan and this isn't what I paid my money for I want those catchey songs that you can't get out of your had and make you think that music just never gets this good . if you already have the other pearl jam cd's buy this its worth it just for the single but if you don't have any buy vs,ten hell even vitalogy because thats what your really looking for."
2,what happend?,"what happend to the old pearl jam? this cd is pretty boring. there's no jumping around on the cd. tracks 5 and 6 or good even without the wildness, but they lost it."
3,A weak effort after Yield,"I was very disappointed with this album after loving their last effort 'Yield"". I tried to let this cd grow on me, but unfortunately the songs on the album are just not very good. Pearl Jam has been known as a great 'song' band and with Binaural they tried to stretch this ability. I think the main problem was the lack of Mike Mcready's participation, he needs to get more involved in the song writing. There are a couple decent songs on the album but overall it is their worst album by a long shot. Here are the few songs I do think are good, lets hope their next one is better than this.....and oh yes the cover is awesome (one star for it)....... Evacuation, Light Years,Nothing As It Seems,Thin Air,Of The Girl...........I warned You!"
2,Definitely Not A Ten,Binaural is a major disappointment both musically and lyrically. Pearl Jam is a very talented band and could have done alot better.
4,Next to TEN this is second best,"I purchased this album three months after purchasing Ten. Many people who have reviewed this album don't like it and yet I can't see why not. 'Binaural' has some very cool songs on it with one of my favourite songs 'Evacuation' and followed by 'Thin Air'.Okay granted some of the songs are below par but heck the good definitely outways the bad. 'Breakerfall' is a good song, although short for a opener for this album. This album should be given another chance by fans, it is a album that you have to listen to more than once to fully appreciate."
4,Different but still a good album,"When I first listened to this album I didn't like it but after I stopped trying to find another ""Alive"" or ""Daughter"" type hit song I began to enjoy this album in its uniqueness. Because this is like no other Pearl Jam album that I've ever heard, but there are some very good songs on it such as ""light years"",""nothing as it seems"", ""thin air"", ""insignificance"", and probably my favorite ""sleight of hand"", my suggestion is to buy this album and just let it grow on you."
4,They're nothing if not consistent.,"Another fine record from the former godheads of grunge, who thankfully have moved light years beyond that short-lived musical craze. PJ will go down in history as a solid rock band that does not shirk its 70's roots, but rather embraces them and combines them with modern rock sensibilities to create first class modern rock. You'll have to hunt this CD down; its probably not featured in the Top 50 rack at your local media superconglomerate store."
1,No You Can Be Much Better Than That,"Even Santana cannot afford to release such a deceiving record, it's not even commercial but lacks completely of soul and spirit. On the same time I bought Chavez Reavine by Ry Cooder, there you find soul. Despite it, I will probably see him and his friends on stage this year at the Montreux Jazz Festival"
1,Will NOT work on an iPOD,"I am very disappointed with this CD's inability to download effectively to my iPOD for my listening pleasure. This is a political issue between Sony and Apple and nothing to do with technology. This is a major upswelling of displeasure over this issue. Search the internet for ""Sony DRM Software"" and you will get tons of articles covering this issue. If you live with your iPOD than this is NOT the CD for you."
1,Good CD completely ruined by copy-protection,"Despite the fact I sampled and enjoyed most of the music on this CD at a local store, I will not be purchasing this or any CD implementing Sony's latest generation of copy-protection. Preventing people who purchase this album from making legal backups or copies for their own personal use on MP3 players is a completely unacceptable practice, and should be stopped.Furthermore, the software installed by this CD cloaks its presence on your computer, disguises itself as something else in case the average user stumbles onto references to it, and has the potential to damage computers if not removed properly (which isn't as easy as going to Add/Remove programs, as it is not listed there).For more information on this new, malicious form of copy-protection, I suggest googling ""sony+DRM+rootkit""."
1,pure crap,"santana himself hate the music he's making,he loves jazz fusion and real rock not this rubbish,but he has sold his soul for money.you are not listening to santana here (like supernatural and shaman) but you are listening to inputs record company made for him."
4,To Those Who Are Complaining,"To all who are ""dissing"" the new CD - instead of being shallow dilettantes and dissecting the lyrics,guest artists, music, copy protection,etc - how about just feeling the joyful sound that comes from Carlos's fingers as he graciously shares his gift and his innate joy. If everyone were as gracious, humanistic, loving and joyful as Carlos then the world would indeed be a better place. So, instead of picking the CD apart as drivel, lighten up and just listen to the music of the man who embodies his art."
2,Santana has done it again... eh... literally!,"Yep! Santana comes back yet once more with the SAME formula: lots of big names in the music biz packed in a nice album, with him and his band playing to them. End of formula. Is the album bad? Not by any means, if you isolate it from the rest of his musical production. But if you consider this guy has been putting out significantly more original material in years past, listening to more of this Santana-guitar-sound-accompanying-some-big-name-in-the-music-business is quite dissapointing. Once more, I feel fortunate for having Napster. I wouldn't buy this album, not even for its contagious opening ""Hermes"". My advice is simple: skip it. I give it two stars for what it's worth production-wise, but nothing else."
5,Awesome Collaborations!,"Another great album of superstar collaborations for Carlos Santana! Steven Tyler, Joss Stone, Los Lonely Boys and Robert Randolph all kill it! Really, really great!"
4,Good listening,"I found this CD to be very easy to listen to. The different artists lend variety and Santana's guitar work is unparalleled.What I do find annoying is why are some of the other reviewers panning Bo Bice""s rendition of ""Brown Skin Girl"" I found the song to be easy to listen to. Just because he was on American Idol does not mean the man is not talented nor should he be disrespected by those who do not consider him ""legitimate""."
1,Love the song but wont buy CD,"I liked the Santana - Steven Tyler song/video. Since I found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something I buy within reasonable means - I wont buy the CD.Want to make sure that Sony loses money in this effort - will teach them a lesson. I have been burned by Sony's proprietary [...] before on other items, so I will stay away."
2,"SAVE YOUR MONEY "" IT SUCKS""",Been a Santana fan since his early days. Liked most of his recordings. But this one really sucks. Last two cd's where all right. Save your money on this one buy some of his early stuffinstead.
1,All That I Am . . . Is A Collaborator,"Message to Carlos Santana: Stop with the collaboration albums! If I want to hear Mary Blige or Joss Stone I will buy their albums (by the way I won't), so why do we have to have this mediocrity foisted on us through pointless collaborations. Stop trying to please know-nothing radio programmers and reward the loyal followers such as myself with a ""pure"" Santana offering.I have been following Santana since Woodstock and have all their CDs but this collabration thing is going too far. Best track by far on this CD is Da Tu Amor, a non-collaborative effort. This shows what the band is capable of when they turn their backs on the detritus that masquerades as today's pop music. If Carlos wants ideas on Cds why not rework Atlanta Rhythm Section's ""Spooky"" or better still ""I Want You"" from the Beatles Abbey Road. I saw him do this track 20 years ago at a concert and it was just crying out to be recorded.Carlos please stop selling out to your loyal fans."
1,DON'T SUPPORT CONTENT PROTECTED!,"CONTENT PROTECTED IS A VIOLATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLES RIGHTS, DON'T SUPPORT ARTISTS THAT ALLOW THIS SOFTWARE ON THEIR ALBUMS"
1,WARNING! Copy protection sucks!,I would advise not getting this CD for that reason - send a message. When I spend money on a CD I want to listen to it when and where I want to without having to download a bunch of software to my computer. I bought this CD today and I am returning it tomorrow.
2,Market-Researched To Death,"After leaving a huge legacy during the '60's and '70s, Carlos Santana made a gigantic, Grammy-winning comeback with his phenomenal album, ""Supernatural"". A big part of his success after being off the radar for years (besides his undeniable talent)was the addition of both songwriting and appearances from many current artists, assuredly a plot hatched by many music execs and focus groups. Unfortunately, they seem to be running that formula into the ground. Two post-Grammy xerox albums later, and I may have finally given up on Carlos for a while. Part of the big problem on this release is the attempt to combine Santana's singular Latin-influenced style with an overabundance of R&B and hip-hop, which just comes across sounding contrived. Your money would be much more well-spent on the recently remastered release of Santana III, which is not only excellent but comes with a bonus disc of live material that smokes."
5,Me and my daughter approve.,"I've been a fan of Santana now for over 30 years. I even remember when he was on the Ed Sullivan Show. But I must say how nice it is that both me and my 15 year old daughter can enjoy this music together. Finally - something we both agree on! She's a big fan of the Black Eyed Peas, and actually the song ""I Am Somebody"" with Will of the Black Eyed Peas is the best, but really we love the whole record...I mean album. It's nice to know that my daughter is listening to music with a positive message, and that's what Santana brings."
1,Here we go again.,"Well, I've had a listen, and its all the same stuff, all over again.Does he not do anything new? Does he not have enough in him to be self supporting? Does he have to rely on bringing other poeple in?We've done this, been there, ready to move on!!! So move on!!! Give me something new to listen to Mr Santana. Please.The CD? Not that good. Expand your horizons. Change your guitar sound. Bring in fresh sound, not this old rehashed stuff with just new voices."
4,This is a great albumn,"It has been a while now since this albumn has been released, and for anyone who has not spent some time with it, let me say this one is great.Turns in direction often have their critics, and I encourage you to listen for yourself. I have. I love it. Santana is bringing out the classic and blending it in well with the new."
4,A Chemical Dependency Must Own,"This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse. It breaks down each of the drugs by category and by use, giving the properties of each and their derivation, and side effects including potential for addiction. Anyone interested in the chemical abuse field, or merely curious about some of the drugs they may be prescribed, will find this an exceptional buy."
5,best cd ive got.,this cd really puts u into a good mood. u do of course have to like this type of music. it was definitly worth the money. if your like me u will listen to the ones you've heard then just listen to all of them and find u will probably like all of them. very excellent
5,You absolutely dont wanna miss this one,"The first time I heard Absolutely(story of a girl) on the radio and totally loved it. i figured they were just a one hit wonder though, but at a multi-band concert i went to over the summer, i saw them play live on the little stage, and they were by far the best band there. after that i went out and got this CD. it is the only CD i own that i can listen straight through and not have to skip any tracks. every song is amaizing and brings some kind of emotion to you when you hear them. i have been hooked ever since and saw them play 2 more times and met them once. they are very talented artists and you really don't want to miss out on hearing this!"
4,Good,"As one reviewer said..""quirky wordplay."" and ""infectious hooks.""Many of the melodies are easy to latch on to. Definitely music not of my generation(I'm 44 years old) but it's high energy and so much more positive than a lot of the gangsta rap garbage that is posing as music today for young impressionable minds. Parents, know what your children are listening to!!"
2,maybe my bs detector is on too high...,"Too many positive reviews here make their point by saying ""Well, at least it ain't no teeny pop or rap metal"". That doesn't mean it's any good. The fact is, this is as a half-baked work with more in common with teen pop than ""straight ahead rock"". I hear the ""sincerity"",but i absolutley don't buy it. Same... you could get from ThirdMatchboxEve6Blind or whatever, just not as well-played or nearly as interesting. This shlock tries way too hard to be liked and ends up sounding third-rate, rather than something all it's own. Same old chords, same insipid lyrics, hooks all over the place saying ""like me! like me!"". It's background music for people who don't want to listen too closely. Not nearly as clever as they would like you to believe. This record will sound ridiculous in two years. Not even Vanilla."
1,*YAWN*,"This book COULD have been really great...but Klare feels the need to repeat and reemphasize something you just read in the last 4 chapters AGAIN. YES, it had some good information...but the absolute monotony and repetion detracted from the book, and I actually wanted to learn more than three or four main ideas that could have been summarized in ten pages or less...one of the biggest wastes of time in my entire life."
2,"Boring, really boring!","Well, this is another ""shocking"" book intented to make you feel alarmed and shocked. The kind of book Michael Moore would be proud to write.In order for you do not waste your time reading this boring, tedious and really, REALLY repetitive book, there goes a short summary of the whole thing:1) America needs more oil. All the world needs more oil;2) America is producing less oil.3) America will need to import more oil.4) The world top producers don't have the resources (technology and investments) to increase their production.5) So, everything will go to hell and a global war will happen.That's it. You've already read the whole book.Vou're welcome."
4,Blood at the Pump,"This is a very well done book that should be read by all. We have a number of fundamental challenges on the globe today and one of them is energy. This book is among those that will effectively make the connection between our energy policy and our foreign policy while also paying some attention to the role our individual habits, values and priorities play in the consumption of oil.This is an important book and one worth considering for those interested in furthering their knowledge of oil consumption metrics, terrorism, influences on foreign policy and what to do about it."
4,Surprise of an eye opener from an elective course in college,"I had to purchase this book for my ""Introduction to International Relations"" class at University of Washington. It was pure elective and I had no clue what I was getting into. I actually enjoyed this book! I was surprised to read many of the facts that Klare goes in depth on regarding America's policy on obtaining oil and the threat of increasing competition from developing nations. The book is loaded with facts and numbers to back everything up, don't let that detract you from reading this, it's an eye opener and a thinker about how our attitudes towards oil need to be less narrow minded."
3,Blood and Oil,"Blood and Oil is an interesting book; however, I personally believe that Klare takes too long to present the problem. I think he overstates the problem with too many facts. Facts do validate the problem and the need for a solution but he just has too many of them to make the facts signicificant. I think he should have spent over half of that time on solutions to the problem. The topic of this book is very well choosen and does need more people to know about it. People do need to understand that this is a problem and we need to do something about it. Over all I thought the book was boring and rather lenghty. The same things could have been said in a chapter. Nobody cares about the history behind the problem. People just need to know that there is one and we need to do something about it soon."
4,Not the worst...,"I think most of the negative reviews here are coming from listeners who expected rock music. The title of the CD is definitely misleading; a more appropriate title would have been ""Still The Same...Great Ballads and Love Songs Of Our Time"". That would sort of put it in the proper perspective. I was never a rocker back in the 70's; I enjoyed the more mellow tunes. I love these songs and I love Rod's voice. Give it a listen."
5,I enjoyed it!,"I bought it to listen to, while I'm on the computer, and it is perfect. I enjoyed his arraingements to some of my old favorites. I know all the words and I enjoy singing along. If you are a fan, you will like the album. If your not a fan .... why would you buy it?"
1,Oh dear............................ this is not good.,"Rod, I love you, always have.I just couldn't get into the American song book stuff. In fact the first of such albums when straight into my bin.To hear you were doing a ""rock"" album was news I needed to hear!!!This is not that album. Get back to me when your ""rock"" album is coming out.So don't do this to us again ......... you're a naughty boy, now go to your room and think about what you've done!! You too, Mr Big Shot Clive James, I'm sure you're involved with this somehow."
1,He should get clear of Clive Davis!!!,"Rod Stewart is in a crisis. He needs an idea independent of his record label owner, Clive Davis, who is so old now, he doesn't leave fingerprints, and his ideas DO NOT FIT a talent like Rod. This album has ""I'm all washed up, so I might as well cash in"" written all over it. Four (count 'em, FOUR) volumes of the Great American Songbook (which was hard to take), then THIS??? This album flat out stinks. There is not a moment on this record that sounds like Rod has any grasp of these songs except ""It'll make money"". Stick to the originals. Rod, I may buy another of your records if you make one the old fashioned way. Write a bunch of good songs, sing them with conviction (the way you used to), and tell Clive to take a flying leap at the moon. You've made them enough money, now do it YOUR WAY!!!!!"
2,Somewhere Between Fair to Blah,"Gosh darn, I was really looking forward to this CD, glad to see that the singer was getting back to roots & away from the total blah of the previous Frank Sinatra style disaster. However, I should have inspected the traks more carefully before ordering this CD. Anyway, I listened to it once & probably won't again. It's not a total waste, but geeze it's dull."
3,The More He Changes the More Static He Becomes,Unfortunately the more Rod Stewart ventures into new territories the more he remains stagnant. He has become mundane. His inimitable voice is there but the fire seems to have gone out. His delivery is no longer focused. Rod Stewart's performances on this CD are perfunctory at best.
4,The Ultimate Healing System: The Illustrated Guide to Muscle Testing and Nutrition,This book gives very practical and helpful information. Very user friendly. I did not give it 5 stars because sections of the book are repetitive or poorly written.For years I have suffered from water bags under my eyes and post nasal drip when I eat food that has a large amount of sodium. I used the recommendations listed in the book and lo and behold they worked. Water bags under my eyes have diminished.
5,My grandson loved this!,"I sent this to my grandson for his sixth birthday. He was very pleased and his pleasure began with the title! I was reminded of the gift of the same book that was given to me when I turned 6 nearly 6 decades ago. The more things change the more things stay the same, I guess."
3,Classic poetry: Now We Are Six,"Beautiful edition of a classic. Most of the poems are great, some not so great."
4,Informative and delightful,A lovely book informing you about the how and why of yoga practice. Each day has a little gem of wisdom to inspire your practice. The information builds as you progress through the book and prepares you for a comprehensive understand of yogic tradition. I liked the author's tone and ability to trick you into understanding the self :)
4,good quotes to read during yoga class,i am a yoga teacher and read the quotes in this book often to inspire my students before or after practice.
4,Kid's love it,I bought one of these for each of my grandkids for christmas. They are 19 & 20 months old and they are having a blast with them. They love hide and seek games and they make it so fun. I also feel they are getting some good exercise they wouldn't be getting this time of year because of the cold weather. So far they seam to be holding up well and they were easy to put up.
4,You need to hear this band!,"I saw Welt open for Social Distortion a few years ago and was completely blown away by their performance. This is no garage punk band. These guys are very good at what they do, which is delivering fast, upbeat, and extremely melodic punk rock that fans of Social Distortion and Green Day should be all over. They have some similarities to Richmond hardcore band Avail as well, especially in terms of the melodic approach and somewhat introspective lyrical content. This band deserves so much more recognition than it gets. If you're into this kind of music, you need to check them out, and Broke Down is a great album to start with. Welt's follow-up albumBrand New Dreamis just as good, if not better."
4,Brand Scan,"Both authors are from public health schools. One is from Amherst, MA. Go Umass! This does make studying statistics more interesting. One can easily adapt the sampling design and methods to marketing surveys that are required of MBA students."
1,Didn't work in the crate,My dog needs lots of water when he travels but instead this water dish always turns upside down and soaks his bedding. I was very disappointed.
5,Definitely worth reading,"I realize language changes over time, and eventually new ways of pronouncing words are adopted. However, there are still a lot of words that seem to confuse people. I have even seen people argue over it.This book has ""proper"" pronunciations of English words. While I wouldn't go as far as he does pronouncing words adopted from other languages, I definitely get irritated when people don't use their ""native"" language properly."
5,Conversation ender!,"...and I mean that in a GOOD way. There are plenty of lengthy reviews here on the merits of this volume, and all the kudos are deserved. In my house, this book comes off the shelf with regularity, always mediating (and settling) a pronunciation dispute. A must for any intelligent household."
4,grate pool cue,i love this pool cue grate balece and weight (20 oz) the only thing that i did not relize was the tip was not a scrue on but a glue on one no biggie just going to be a job putting a new one on when the time come just to warn futer buyers the pacakageing for shiping is not the best big box lots of room to move dent and scratch the cue and i would sujest to not bundle it with other things for cheeper shipping because they do not put anything in the box to seperate the items more chances for denting and scratching the cue
4,Earrings,"I had bought this item for a friend. It was shipped to her and she said it was beautiful and she loved it. I never personally got to see it myself, but she was pleased, and that was the main thing I was concerned about. The delivery was prompt and the item was in good shape when it arrived."
5,GE Ice Maker,"Easy to install and works great. Having a tech come out would have been almost $300 but I purchased for 20% of this cost and installed myself in about 10-15 minutes. Nice thing about this purchase was the fact that not only did it come with the ice-maker, it came with pretty much every part that i might potentially have issues with down the road. (If you purchase different parts from a parts store, it would have been over $200.Great buy and suggest ordering if you have issues with your ice-maker."
1,You can't fight getting lame,"Advance reveiws have generally treated this album as a return of GVSB to the glory of their early '90s years. I wish I could say that this is so, but it just ain't. I loved the group back then (especially ""House of GVSB""), but for me they've long since lost their spark and have become just another ageing rock band long overdue for retirement. The work here sounds like a very lame rehash of earlier, better work. In short, it's tired. Come up, guys, you can't fight it. Your rock 'n' roll days are over!"
3,Just doing his job......,"It's rather frightening to think that the 'warrior ethos ' allows such contempt for human life. There was nothing in his upbringing, no obvious signs of mental abbheration but he was able to make life and death judgements for thousands of people with no apparent remorse. Life on the run was just boring...too bad it didn't finish like Eichmann as a warning to other war criminals. Blood is thicker than water but I wonder if his family should have funded and protected him for so many years."
5,Tim,"I'm not sure I'd agreed with the review regarding the comparison to Message in a Bottle (which is a melodramatic tragedy). Tim is one of my all time favourite movies (I hated Message in a Bottle). I fell in love with the movie when I was maybe 13 years old. It's about a middle aged woman who befriends a retarded man (rather against her will), and they eventually fall in love. It is ultimately a love story, but much of the movie is about their relationship and how much it brings her out of her shell and helps him to understand the world. It is based on a book by Colleen McCollough....a great book that led to a really touching movie."
1,"Where is the ""eject"" button?","""Eject"" is becoming the most used button on my remote control, especially with films such as ""Altitude."" Save your money for something more substantial."
3,interesting low budget sci fi movie,"This one is quite interesting and has a interesting twilight zone type of storyline with that type of ending. It's not a bad movie in the least as the one star reviewers claim. If you like the twilight zone or the outer limits then you will enjoy this one. The cast does a fine job and most of the effects look great, a few less so but this is low budget land and no effect is as bad in todays terms as some other flicks out there at this budget. (some scy fy movies for instance) However scy fy's tv shows are much better in that regard. Anyways it does have the typical mindless aggressive jock character here but it other than that no other character is a flat stereotype here. The actors all do manage to do a very good job here and that helps too. This one looks fantastic on blu ray and you get a how they shot it bonus feature as well."
2,"Losing altitude, fast.","I think most people who have seen this movie agree that it will not win any awards. It isn't very memorable except for the characters being obnoxious and annoying. Thus, it's not very likely I'd recommend it to anyone.....over the age of 12. Then again, if you have a group of 5+ people with nothing to do and 'naked twister' is not an option, play this movie and grab your alcoholic beverage of choice. Trust me, it'll make the experience that much better if you think of it as something kitschy, like your neighbor's Pomeranian in haute couture.Bottom line: If thin plot lines, confused endings, bad acting, horrible scripts and yelpy tweens offend you, stay far far away. Altitude originally got 3 stars for having the courage to try; unfortunately, there was a 1 star deduction for falling short and being mediocre."
5,a true classic,"I have wanted to read this book since I first saw the movie with Susan Hayward (many moons ago). It was so interesting to see how the film version differed, but the basis for the story is all there. The book really gives a view of how much our world has changed and not changed, especially for women."
1,"Expensive, bad sound and unconfortable","Well first of all I need to write that I'm a huge fan of Creative Labs products but this one is just the worst tech product that I bought in years. Is expensive for the sound quality wich is the same (and maybe worst!) of my retail Sansa MP3 Player Earphone. Second and more important to me is the confort... I tried with all sizes of earbuds and I get 2 results: the bigger is just to big and with the medium and small size the earbuds just never keep in a good position inside my ear. I did all the instructions the come with the product to put the earbud inside my ear and the same... with any movement of my head the earbuds move out of my ear and is very frustating. Finally I returned this product and received my refund. Expensive toy, bad sound and unconfortable!"
2,Creative Zen Aurvana In-Ear Headphones,"They make it sould like these are active noise canceling headphones. They are also priced like they are. However, they are just over-prices bud headphones."
2,They arrived damaged and had to be returned!,The left ear bud did not carry sound. It was damaged when shipped and the product had to be returned. I was embarrassed to have given it as a gift.
2,Poor sound quality,"Very disappointed with the sound. Eagle vision usually has very good recording quality. This sounded like there was one mike in a tin can at the back of the theater. Worst blue ray that I have ever heard. Will be putting up for sale,burning it, the apple iTunes version of machine head album sounds way better than this. Do not wate your $$$$."
3,"Sorry Ian, you're time is up","I bought the concert dvd despite criticism of Gillan's voice. When you play the opening tune, however, you'll understand that the criticism is warranted - unfortunately. I respect Gillan and all those his age that still love to perform and want to soldier on - especially considering Deep Purple remains a popular touring band. But the man is 66 years old. I didn't buy this expecting a knock out vocal performance but I naively thought the critics are too tough and expect to much. Well, maybe they still are but the vocals were even weaker than I expected. Very thin but clearly he's trying. The band is obviously great but its going to be hard to play this repeatedly when the vocals borderline on bothersome. If you want a satisfying Gillian performance, where everyone is firing on all cylinders, check out DP's 1996 Montreux dvd instead."
3,Better than expected,"The book is long with tiny type, much more than the pamphlet I expected. Mao seems to be a surprisingly smart guy, for a murderous tyrant. His passion seems to be to keep the masses mobilized and excited. The antithesis of Maoism seems to be quiet contentment in work and family life. This is what he means when he calls America a ""paper tiger"" -- the great variety of lifestyles, beliefs and interests is useless to him."
1,fanatism,"it's unbelievable how we can find, nowadays, people who call themselves ""maoists"". There is no logic. Maoism is violence and pure dictatorship... this book is a book of slogans and people who love a book like this are looking for slogan and not for political consciousness. Try Gramsci, it's really better"
4,A relic of the past,"For those of us that grew up during this turbulent time, this was (if you were on the left) almost a companion piece to ""The Diary of Che' Guevera"". If you're investigating, doing research on the sixties, this would be a good source to start from."
5,Never Say Its Too Late,"This was a book that whenever you picked it up it touched your heart. It is hard to think that some preteens have to go through what they did. Laugh, cry, get mad, you will eventually do all of this when you pick up this book. I recomend this book to everyone that is having a hard time in their preteen days."
4,Great book,My daughter thinks it is a very informative book and has not put it down since we got it. Good read.
3,Hmmmmmm..........,"I liked it alot, but there was some stuff that didn't thrill me. I do agree that it is a guide through the preteen years, but some of the stories, like sickness, death and dying, tragic events. In that part it was like a bad horror movie. I started reading at a very young age, only nine, and maybe that's why. But it was very sad. I didn't need to know that stuff, really. When I read one story, about this boy having woken up in the middle of the night, and hurling, and all this ucky stuff, the next night I couldn't get to sleep because the story scared me. What would happen if that happened to me? I wound up not liking it as much, as I thought I would. It's only the truth. I'm waiting till I'm older to maybe enjoy it more."
3,THE WORST,"BY:STEPHANIEAT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ. WELL, TURNS OUT I WAS WRONG. HONESTLY I THOUGHT THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ.I THINK THIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ BECAUSE IT SENT ME NO MESSAGE SO I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO UNDERSTAND IT. THE ORDER OF THE BOOK WAS HARD TO FOLLOW. ALSO, THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION WAS TOO MUCH FOR A PRETEEN. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHERS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'D BE JUST AS CONFUSED AS I AM."
4,Not bad,"The pad is just like every other pad and I kind of hate using them because they get icky very quickly but it's really fine. The scraper is very useful but sometimes you have to really get in there if something got burned and sat for a little while. I would have given this 3 stars BUT, the scraper works even better on my granite countertops than it does on the stove itself. For that alone, I use it all the time to get those little rough patches that are hard to scrub up without being worried about scratching or eroding the finish of the granite. Works especially well in our coffee area where the little bits of sugar get wet and stick to the counter."
4,A little expensive for the quality,"I feel its kind of expensive for plastic razor scraper. I pushed really hard and it did not break! I only gave it 4 stars due to price.I had to scraper really really hard on one little spot to get it completely clean for 10 minutes. The burnt on grease cerama bryte remover does not work well. I used the remover liquid with the razor while i was scraping to speed the process. It will take me forever to clean my glass top. 1 rating for the burnt on grease remover cleaning solution.i tested the remover solution for 10, 20, and 30 minutes. I was not impressed!"
3,STOVE CEANER & RAZOR,"I JUST BOUGHT THE NEW STOVE AND THIS ITEM, AND IT WORKS GREAT. COULDN'T FIND IT IN ANY APPLIANCE STORE.SO I AM VERY PLEASED. DO U SELL THE REFILLS FOR THE RAZOR?"
3,What I paid for,"This book was a little older than expected, but the book was in the condition I was told. I was satisfied with the purchase."
4,"Some hard work, ultimately worth it.","Slogging a little bit, because it's difficult to read even interesting prose descriptions of paintings and also painfully aware that I lacked a lot of the technical understanding of what he was discussing-- my history of art knowledge has huge holes in it. I turned frequently to the Internet to find the paintings Vasari was discussing and that helped a great deal.I read the George Bull translation and it felt really clunky, although it's a plus that the footnotes are at the bottom of the pages rather than at the rear of the book. If I'm going to go on to read Volume 2 then I have to say that I'd choose another translator.I knew in an intellectual way that a lot of the Renaissance was about reclaiming lost arts and sciences, but reading Vasari gave me a much better gut level feel about that really meant about the development of the arts. Connects real people to the history lesson, albeit in a gossipy and occasionally too-flowery way."
4,Adidas shorts,"These adidas shorts are great for just wearing out or exercising, they have pockets so they're great for storing items also."
3,Just Buy The First One,"Very good, but not as good as WHO SHARES WINS. The lyrics are still pretty much the same, but songs, like the title song, come off a bit cheesy."
2,The book was mostly just boring.,"A few of the chapters were interesting. I liked the ones about slave revolts, but the rest were about people talking about war, the sugar interest, or other VERY boring things. I had to read this book for school and was supposed to take notes, but the book was so boring that I couldn't find the main idea of many chapters. The most interesting characters in the book didn't even exist and the historical ones were hardly even mentioned. For a historically acurate book, Caribbean is hardly acurate and I would not read this one just for fun."
3,"Historical, but not too engaging","A word of advice: When you are tempted to purchase one of Michener's books, take a look at when it was published. If it was after, say, 1985, just put the book back on the shelf. This great writer slowly sank into the sunset long before he ceased publishing. The works in his later years have the tone of a stodgy, old man. Take Caribbean, for instance. It was published in 1989. If you have little or no idea about Caribbean history, it will give you a pretty good rundown. But it is dry, passionless, bloodless. In the few places where Michener tries to convey a romance, it is laughable, pathetic and unbelievable. This book is good for history, but as a novel, it's a loser. I give it three stars. I am being very generous."
4,He Did Well!,"For someone just going around visiting haunted places, I think he did extremely well. He isn't a paranormal investigator, he is just someone who is interested, but did better than many I have seen. Prospect Place was done very well. If you go back tell George HEY! lol. We had the house to ourselves and caught numerous things there. Excellent place to go if your interested in the paranormal."
3,The amateur came out,I am a avid paranormal hobbyist myself. This video proves what happens when you set out to find evidence of the paranormal and realize that you just can't goto a haunted place and have the ghost put on a show. I think that even the best ghost hunters will tell you that sometimes you strike out and sometimes if you are notcareful to debunk your findings that you may just want to believe what you hear or see as paranormal. This movie shows how amateur ghost hunters who want to seeor hear something so bad will tend to come to a quick decision on things. But the video had enough questionable evidence to satisfy the believer. But not enough to sway anyone who doubts ghosts exists.
2,A lot of syrup,This DVD has a few really enjoyeable songs. It is one of those videos that seeing it one time is enough. There are some good history points and traveling interest Daniel explains and good scenery of Ireland which make the video palatable. Too much video footage is of Daniel himself. I would recommed buying this DVD if you can get it for a low price.
3,Could have been a lot better,"As many have stated this is not nearly as good as the first one, also the incredible mistake of putting Busta Rhymes on the disc is mind-boggling. His rendition of Iron Man (with horribly reworked lyrics) is more an insult than a tribute and totally out of place here. Having said that, the rest of the bands deliver the goods with special mention to Pantera, Slayer and Godsmack who deliver worthy performances. A puzzling rendition of Never Say Die by Megadeth leaves you wondering if it's Dave Mustaine singing or someone else, and Monster Magnet just fills Into the Void with a lot of noise that gets really boring after a while."
4,"Tribute II, a lot of heavy love","Black Sabbath remains the standard to which I judge the heavy side of rock music...they were and are unparalled. The first ""Nativity in Black"" is an awesome cd...a great tribute to a band that has inspired many of todays heavier bands. I couldn't wait for ""Nativity II"". Got it...like it a lot. It is more interpretive than the first. For example, just as I started to get depressed with a couple of the songs openings all of a sudden they took off in classic Sabbath style.....wall of sound awesome. Then there are many great semi-straight remakes, like Megadeath's ""Never Say Die"". This song alone makes this a CD worth buying..that good. Not every song is what you'd expect, but a true Sabbath fan will love it all. I'm glad there is a Sabbath to tribute, and many of us who love them."
4,some good stuff,"i gotta admit, i picked this one up, hoping to get a couple good tracks, and a few laughs. i was pleasantly suprised. the best thing about this cd is that you get various artists doing sabbath in a more original style (megadeth, etc.) and some pretty damned good renovations on some good tunes like snowblind (soad) and the soulfly cover. this is worth picking up.the only downfalls to the album are the anything but enjoyable static x cover and the pathetic finale.enjoy!"
3,Just 2 Settings,"This is just a basic two speed heat gun. The fan and heat settings can't be controlled separately (The description is a bit misleading). It's either low fan/low heat or high fan/high heat. That said, the price was right."
3,GUN NOT OPERATING,"HELLO! BUY A HEAT GUN BUT DOES NOT GENERATE HEAT, NOT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE IT.HOW I CAN DO SO THAT I DO GET A NEW PRODUCT IN GOOD CONDITION!!??"
2,FYI: NOT as described!,"This item is described as having dual heat range AND dual speed settings. ALL it has is one high/low switch, like a hair dryer. Maybe this is fine for what many people need, it doesn't suit my purposes. It seems like false advertising, certainly misleading anyway! Even printed on the products package are all the various features it offers but are all just different ways of stating what it actually is capable of. I even spoke with someone at the company and he confirmed that this is just a lower end product with a high/low switch ""like a hair dryer"" - his words. It does come with a number of nice accessories and a nice hard carrying/storing case..."
2,Great until it burned out,This was a great heat gun until it burned out after ~10 hours of cumulative time over 8 months. I ran it on only the low setting :(
1,Stopped after second use,Bought it back in 2010 but only started using it recently. Used it a month ago to peel some lino. Started using it again last night and it worked for 10 min then shut off. Now it won't turn on.
4,Bringin the heat!,I just bought this heat gun to get the hideous tint off of my car that the previous owner had put on. It actually worked quite well. I have no complaints about the product itself. My problem is the case it has to be in. The box doesn't hold the accessories very well and I still haven't been able to close the things since I've opened it. Nothing fits in there correctly unless I'm missing something. All and all I'm happy with my purchase. It was shipped and received quickly
5,Corvette Air Filter,This item fit very well in my car. It appears to be a well made product made to fit properly.
5,"""Ah see...the Red Storm a-risin'...""","No kidding, whenever I thumb past this book in my bookcase, I mentally hear John Fogerty's voice. But seriously, my most recent reading of this book has me wondering why he never did a non-series book after this one. There's the Jack Ryan series. There's the developing Mr. Clark series (which is a spinoff from the Ryan books). There's the Op Center series. And there's the new Net Force series (yep, I guess there's a second one of those--haven't found it yet). Maybe the World War III scenario with the Russians is a dated concept, but there are lots of subjects that Mr. Clancy's fertile mind could base another one-shot book on. I love series reading, don't get me wrong, but there's something to be said about a one-book story."
2,Maybe if this had been written just by Clancy it would have been good...,"I read this after my 5th read of Hunt for Red October (I love it)... and I had to go back and check that I was reading a Tom Clancy novel. It reads so differently from HfRO, and not in a good way, in my humble opinion. I have not read any of Clancy's other novels, but can only assume that Bond's co-authorship is what ruined this for me. Be forewarned: if you're looking for something on par with Hunt for Red October--this isn't it."
5,"Plausible scenario, very well written","I really liked this book. It's been a while since I read it, but it was very well thought-out and entirely believable. From the events that spark the conflict to the actual troop movements, Clancy did his homework on this one. Although it is a bit dated, it is still a great story; all in all, it's very entertaining.There are some people who just don't get Clancy, and this book won't be any better for them than any other, but for fans of the genre, this is a fantastic book."
4,"I'm not a Clancy fan, but I'll be honest here.","This book was fast paced and techno, but most of the action lay in dialogue between commanders so that the book could fit twenty battles where most would fit one, and despite the amount of dialogue between commanders I could never get to love the people enough to get emotional over the events. It was rather more like history to me. So and so won a battle, and so and so then got shot in the head because of another so and so's conspiracy, and then the other so and so lost a battle. But if you like books that are techno military without much emotion and with a bird's eye view of a hundred battle scenes buy this book; it's probably Tom Clancy's best. Else wise I would really recommend a book named: Cain by James Byron Huggins."
2,This is just a story for another american movie,"It would be a good movie, but in reality III World war would be much different. We read books and wach movies to expirience what we want to expirience. In the reald world III world war would last for decades, without the nuclear weapons. And at last there would be no winners."
2,I wouldn't buy it.,Length:: 1:13 MinsIn this video you can hear the First Act MG409 being played followed by a review.
3,Careful Spraying - And Buy the Concentrate,"OK the cleaner itself, I give 5 starts. It is indeed all that and a bag of chips so to speak.However, I'm sensitive to salicylates and something in this gives me awful respiratory reactions when I spray it. ""Chemically sensitive"" does not mean that every non-toxic, natural thing is OK (I'm allergic to aspirin, so aloe is a problem, etc.)That isn't the fault of the cleaner; the 3 stars is because if you're having it shipped, buying the spray is silly. Much better to buy the 32 oz concentrate. Then you can mix it in a spray bottle at home, and you can use it in different strengths for different tasks.OR, if you're like me, buying the concentrate and not the spray means you can dilute it in a dish and dip the rag in -- no spraying means no inhaling. Since it bugs me I wouldn't want it in the air around my pets or baby."
2,"cute costume, but leggings were a big disappointment!!","I ordered the Jane Jetson Halloween costume and was excited to wear it to a party. I had tried it on at a store and it fit really well, but I decided to order it online to save a few bucks. What a mistake! When I received it I very briefly looked at it and put it aside until Halloween. Well to my surprise, when I was putting the leggings on, it turned out that my package had two right legs instead of one right leg and one left leg. There is a white stripe that runs down the outside of the legs. I had one stripe on the outside of my right leg and one stripe on the inside of my left leg when I wore it. It ruined the costume. On top of that the leggings kept sliding down my legs ALL NIGHT LONG. It turned what would have been a fun night into a really long night and I just wanted to go home and take it off. I had to wear it since I didn't have a back-up costume, otherwise I would have returned it."
1,Zumo 550 problems,"I have now had two Zumo 550's completely fail. The first made it three weeks, the second made it 4 weeks-Failure is the same on both units-simply died (not a battery issue).As the weather prohibits riding a MC at the moment, my only experience with the 550 has been in a car. When it works, very good and easy to use.While the store replaced the first one (and they will replace the second one), I expect much better from a product at this price point. I will be asking for a refund at this point.Suffice it to say that I have zero confidence that this unit will survive when exposed to the vibrations and weather on a motorcycle!"
4,almost perfect,"I love the navagation screen. The 3d effect allows me to quickly determine where I'm going. The satallite radio is the best! Rode 800 miles listening to weather and non-stop music. Love the MP3 player as well, although found out that songs purchased on itunes won't play on it. The only real complaint I have is that the unit needs to be placed in the cradle perfectly and the contacts completely dust free or it thinks it should run on battery power thereby disabling the audio. The motocycle mount is a little vibration prone adding some static to the audio. This on a 2007 BMW K1200 GT, a pretty smooth bike. I made some vibration isolators out of medical tubing and that fixed the problem."
3,Point of Interest (POIs) don't show on the map -- ???,"I've used a borrowed Zumo 550 on my bike, along with ""on the fly"" and prechosen (via PC) personal points of interest. I uploaded them on an SD module into the 550, but they didn't appear on the map.Ironically, BMW's version of the 550 (for a lot more money, given...) has mapping that shows the custom POIs. Why doesn't Garmin do the same for the ""vanilla"" 550?"
4,"Great navigator, marginal manual","The navigator itself works wonderfully. I couldn't be more satisfied with the performance. The directions have been very good and the text to voice has very clear pronounciations. The manual is another story. Most of what I've learned with regard to operation of the device has been by trial and error. This biggest headache I had was getting the device to give me voice navigation prompts to my headset with bluetooth. Eventually, I noticed that there was an audio button in the bluetooth settings and this allowed me to set it up correctly. There is nothing in the manual about the audio button. The manual is next to useless."
4,Garmin Zumo,Looks Great and works great but do not purchase for the XM radio feature.The Manual is very sketchy about the radio and you have to purchase a 300 dollar antenna to make it work and no other details about the quality of the radio. Other than the XM the Zumo's displays and ease of operating is execlent.
2,I hope the second GPS works better than the first one.,The GPS worked fine for a couple of days and then it never turned on again. I sent a mail to DIGITECHDEALS and they told me to send them the GPS and they would send me a new one. The new shall arrive this week. Fast response from DIGITECHDEALS.
5,Best Ever,"Installation was straightforward. Programminng from the included mapping cd was easy. The Zumo finds position faster than my iWay. If you dedide to alter your programmed route it recalculates very quickly to get you to your destination. It is easy to see and easy to read, The music downloaded to the unit from iTunes sounds good through the headset and I can use the Bluetooth to answer my cellphone if necessary. It also looks good on the bike. I have no complaints at all. Great unit and worth the pricey cost."
2,watch out with toddlers,"Our pool provides these on request, and I put my 2-year-old in one to give him a little extra safety boost. He tripped in the kiddie pool, fell forward, and was held face down in the water by this thing. He was completely unable to flip over or lift his head. The lifeguard and I made it to him at about the same time. Scariest water experience I've ever had, and he would have been absolutely fine if he hadn't been wearing this vest. Makes me wonder about life vests in general for this age group. Watch out."
3,Misleading Name,"Well, when you are researching a bunch of bicycle accessories and you see ""QR"" in the title, you can pretty much assume that stands for Quick Release. Except for this one. It does NOT have a Quick Release clamp, it has a 4 bolt allen wrench clamp. you can see this if you look closely at the photo, but I guess I missed it after comparing so many racks, some of which have Quick Release clamps.I'm sending mine back, because I really wanted that feature so I can move it to different bikes easily. This rack looks OK and well built, but it stands out as being rated for only 15 lbs as compared to 20 for most of this type, and it seems a bit short (I ordered the V model)."
3,"Great idea, a great try...","I bought this game, and i thought it was great! for a while, now I kinda regret buying it. Though, the two player mode is kinda cool, you can't have that on the Mac/Pc version. Also, direct control is AWESOME! But, its only good if you only have one sim to control. For all the games ups, it has a downside, that kinda evens it out. *sigh*. But it was a great idea, and a great try..."
4,slow sims,I am not the best sims player. The good part about this game is the graphics. Maybe it's me but it moves along very slowly so I am bord. I just leave it set up and when there is nothing interesting on tv I switch over to the play station.
1,Very Disappointed,"I am very disappointed because unlike the computer game, you can not have kids. They don't grow old and ect.. This game was very disappointing. I wish I could get my money back and just play the computer Sims 2. The computer version is much better!"
1,BORED BORED BORED,The creators have lost th whole theme of the Sims which is to create you own family tree.I cannot believe all you get to do is fulfill wants and aspirations. I get bored doing this. I mean the best part of the Sims was that you created your own family from birth-death. Instead the computer generates you a supposed family tree-they are so ugly. A load of crap. [...]Funny how they failed to mention that all the original aspects of the Sims has been removed in SIMS2 playstation. You'll have more fun buying the SIMS2 on PC not PS2. Serious. I don't play computer games often- but with the Sims I thought it was worth my time-now I have lost interest- I feel cheated- so will you if you buy on PS2.
3,Good game.,"I am not agreeing with Linda who previesly wrote in. Sims 2 is a great game even though the saving is not to good. You would be stupid to compair Playstation with PC because they are two diffrent things. It does get boring sometimes and it takes to long to load. I like it how it is kind of real and they are realistic looking. I would have liked it better if you could own horses and build stables. Also I think their should be some pets in the game. You can make peaple look like celebirtys also. Mine looks like Cher! I have never played the first Sims game but this one is fun. If you want a game that can keep you busy for a while, this is the kind of game. You can ever read books! You can die and challenge the Grim Reaper to a fiddle contest!"
1,Ps2 sims 2 duhhhh it's crap!,"Ahhhhh.....creating families, having watched thier first birthday, awwww they're soooo cute!Cut the crap, thats the pc version.I opened that gift and i knew what it was when he brought it home! sims 2! sims 2! Christmas day comes ""Yayayay sims 2 for ps2!"" i put it in and huh? no kids?? It doesn't look the same as the pc one?? it's so much harder to control...so confused. I turn it off. Look it up on pc a few day later huh the graphics look different on this one thats because they are. i love the sims games but this is a poor attempt to try and make it different for people using ps2's. anyone agree??? i want 2 take it back! [...]"
2,Interesting...,"This game is about the same as all the other console versions. Sure, there are some cool new objects and making recipes is fun. Even controlling dead sims is cool. Other than that, it is exactly the same as bustin' out. i think the biggest dissapointment was that it is nowhere near as good as the PC version. If you don't have a PC, get this one. If u do, get the PC version. it is better and cheaper(at least if u get it off this website)"
5,One of my Favorite Books!,"If is a compilation of short ideas/poems that focus on Jesus' love. They are little paragraphs that challenge your way of thinking. For me as a christian, this is an essential to get me back to Jesus' main message: love. Love others because He first loved us. It's an awesome book, and I recommend it for anyone, religious or not. I've also used a few of the entries for bible discussions, and they always get people talking."
2,Pixelated and Dull,"Poster is quite pixelated and the colors are much more dull than on the real piece itself, it does not do justice to this beautiful work of art. Having seen the original many times at it's home at the Prado museum in Madrid, I am very dissapointed with this poor reproduction. This is one of the most fantastic paintings, if not the most, by Bosche and I highly recommend searching elsewhere for a quality reproduction - even if you have to shell out some extra money it's worth it since this is a famously intricate painting where detail matters immensely."
4,History game,"I got this game as a gift for my neice and nephew - they are home schooled and have had a very conservative upbringing. I needed something that would still be fun for them, but that their parents would approve of and allow them to use. They seemed to like the game and even though they are two years apart in age, they tied the first two times they played together!"
2,The Band of Gypsy's Return Review,"Well, no -- Hendrix would not sound like this. He used three 100Watt Marshall stacks pushed at full volume to derive unbelievable tones from his guitar. Simply put -- there's not much tone on this album, nor sustain, nor overtones that come from Marshalls on 10. Yeah, there's talented guitarists, like Andy Aledort, but the notes seem to die out. Obviously, you can't hook up a series of Marshall stacks in a studio without blowing the studio out, but anything less than the stage tone from the Fillmore East recording 69/70, is a sub-par re-recording of that famous set."
2,"nice film, wrong ratio","Four stars for the film, no stars for the DVD. What I absolutely do not get is why this film is presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The theatrical release was widescreen; the DVD should at the very least contain the film in it's original form. A missed chance."
5,EXCELLENT!,"There has never been a film such as this that has captured sexuality at it's best! done with such taste and beauty. Even the true homophobic will find this film compelling and enchanting, enjoy this film, you'll regret not viewing it!"
4,Great for the price!,"Well worth the [money} $39.99 and free shipping and handling. I'm not too sure if i would pay that much more for it. Works great. Great on the buttocks. I use it normally in the living room while watching tv. It takes a little to get use to, especially your balance, but worth it.gina"
3,"Okay product, but not worth the workout","This product works fine, but the calories burned are not worth the effort you put into it. It feels like it takes forever to burn any calories!!! I could burn the same or more calories (around 600 an hour) by running or jumping rope for an hour."
1,"This Need a Update! Very Expensive, not good package!",great music bla bla etc... but this need a update the package is too poor! for the price! expensive!
2,Save your money,"This book really [is bad]. I have done image streaming fora while now. I do it 30 minutes,twice a day and have gonethrough many a trigger and have seen NO IMAGES period.The only thing I do see is kaleidoscopic patterns of lightappear before me when I shut my eyes, and other wierd blobsof light patterns. But I didn't need Wenger to tell me this.He is getting two stars for the following reasons[1]showing me what I already have expereinced.[2]for being honest in stating that 30% of people who doimage streaming will fail !I am his waterloo !Despite this nasty review I will do image-streaming for a bitlonger-for a couple of weeks longer at max and if no improve-ment - [end] this method."
1,Can You Say - Stuffing The Ballot Box?!?,"At the time of this writing, when I click on 'See all 91 reviews' ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS on the page (reviews 1-10) are written by a reviewer who has reviewed ONLY THIS BOOK! Since 7 of these 10 reviews ARE 5 star reviews I either have to conclude that this book is the most sensational book of the century and inspires people who have never written another review ever to sign up on Amazon to do just that for this book OR the ballot box is being stuffed here. Read the more measured reviews and the astute reader will be able to easily discern which of these two possibilities is true...I, personally, don't like it when the seller himself or reviewers associated with the seller do not identify themselves as such when reviewing a product!"
3,Waring!!,"I want to give a waring...about this book and image streaming inn general. I have tried image streaming for an entire year, and as promisd, you get more connected too your unconsiousnes. But free flot image streaming make you lose contoll over much off your mind, as unconsious feelings, pictures, etc. pops upp inn your mind. I have some times been full off fear, because things poping up arn`t allways things you want too see/feel. This happens all the time too me now. Its starting too fade whit time, but still I warn you too bee carefull. But still the book is a good one, because there are many intresting pages of reading inn it. But do not trust all you read!!"
3,Becareful...,"I have read the book and I have applied the image streaming program for a couple of months. The hope was to improve my IQ and generally bring my thinking models closer to those of genus. I do think image streaming works, however, I think it side-effects (while driving) out way its benefits. I have notice that my ability to stay on task has drastically decreased. I find my self day dreaming all the time. If that is not bad enough I am starting to hallucinates. I have stopped the program due to fears of loosing what remaining control is left. If you read this book and practice the imaging streaming religious you will notice differences in yourself. However, I dout we as a whole have to knowledge to control the subconscious.you have been warned"
4,PLEASE READ,"This is for the person who said image streaming has no credible evidence of producing results. Also they claimed they tried image streaming for 15 minutes everyday for six months. Really you must have been doing something wrong, I have not read this book but I can tell you 15 minutes is a very short time for image streaming. You're meant to be pushing yourself, for me personally after I have image streamed for a minimum of 30 minutes all at once my head feels heavy like I have done something. Just thought people should know so they don't get mislead by one person's subjective opinion."
3,Not bad,"Not a bad debut from the ""hacks"". Boyz-in-tha-hood is great, but except for that there is nothing here you haven't heard before. They sound a little like green day and their lyrics aren't all that good when they try to be serious. Dear Kate may be the best song besides Boyz, but the lyrics in it you hear in almost every song nowadays ""im through with you girl, f#ck you, etc. Good punk rock, just not very original (except boyz of course). Its still worth a chance."
3,Not bad,"It's an OK rock/pop album. After the first five or six songs, the album gets kind of boring; until song 10, ""boyz in tha hood."" Overall, a decent album; nothing spectacular."
4,works great,This one i bought of Rodney is still working great and sounds great very happy with this on it is very funny sayings
2,This drive is (was) great!,"I don't know what they're talking about, I own a year old Sony VAIO w/a P4 HT 3.06 GHZ processor and 1028 MB of RAM and this drive clocks 40x when I burn CD-R Data disks and can burn videos at the listed DVD+R speed, 8x. Most DVD+R disks are 8x or under in speed so there really is no use in having a 16x DVD burner, but I guess in the near future there will be media that can burn at 16x. By the way the other reviewers mentioned that they were using DVD-R media, that media is made to be used with Macs not PCs, you're supposed to use DVD+R on a Windows PC. So that could have been they're problem. I use this drive with Nero 7 Ultra Edition and it works great. Then again it's a Sony so it has to be great!Follow-up: Drive ended up failing after a year or two of non-use. Will not read any discs, ended up taking apart to attempt a fix but alas it ended up in the garbage. Can't recommend this drive, even if it isn't for sale anymore."
3,Not bad!,"I'm a coffee snob! When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I was excited to make my morning cup of coffee so quickly and easily. Unfortunately, what I sacrificed was taste. I've since sampled over a dozen different types of k-cup coffees made for my machine and have yet to find one that makes a truly delicious cup of coffee. I will continue to try all of the recommended brands hoping to find that ""ahhhhh"" flavor. In the meantime, I use the little filter adaptor that allows me to use my own ground beans in the machine. The Kenya Kilimadjaro k-cup is probably one of the better coffees I've tried so far but the snob in me still only rates it a 3-star taste compared to what I would consider a great cup of coffee."
2,Not such a great idea,"I was so excited to see this mat I thought that it would be great to use with the wooden airplanes and buildings. I cannot understand why this mat was not made to accomodate the buildings/planes that are made for the wooden set (,planes, hangers, firehouse etc.) The mat should be a runway without airplanes and buildings pictured so that it could actually be played with. If anything they should have drawn dotted lines for where to place buildings that you have. What are you supposed to do with the wooden buildings that you have they do not fit on the mat. The planes can actually go inside the wooden hangers(more fun than a flat mat). Though the hangers are too small to accomodate all the planes(example the kids hanger....only two fit not three) It does make a nice, expensive rug or door mat for decoration though."
4,Excellent Account of the Original Civil War!,"Lumpkin has written an excellent account of where the American Revolutionary War was won - in the South. Since family members and friends were often pitted against one another, this may be accurately termed as the original Civil War.The book starts with the first British attack on Charleston in 1776 and finishes with the British surrender at Yorktown in 1781. In between are descriptions of Camden, the British capture of Charleston, Cowpens, Kings Mountain, Eutawville, Guilford Court House, and several smaller engagements.While the book is an excellent read, the battle descriptions and strategic manuevers are accompanied by too few maps. Having more maps would have given the reader a better idea of the overall strategy and battle tactics.Complaint aside, I highly recommend the book as an excellent source for the first Civil War in the South!"
4,Fun Read,Some great tongue in cheek jokes in here. Not quite as deep a story as I would expect from Gerrold but I enjoyed reading it on a 4 hour plane flight.
2,Hurts To Listen To,"When seeing this in the record store, I was drawn to the sticker on the front featuring Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, From Autumn To Ashes and Poison The Well. All amazing bands in their own respects, but this album should not be compared to these bands or their albums. This cd has some interesting instrumental work but nothing spectacular. The vocals sound dry and uninteresting. All in all, this album was a big disappointment. The sticker throws the consumer right off, it is decieving."
4,When Love Turns to Fear: Answers from an Abuse Survivor,"As a former abused victim, the author has very good insight into what happens in an abusive situation. The lists identifying different types of abuse, the personalized questions, and her encouragement for victims to seek help all make this a terrific help. However, it is poorly edited with numerous typos and style inconsistencies which are distracting, so I can't give it a 5-star rating.It is definitely worth having on hand for those who are being or know someone who is being abused."
1,false hopes,"I wrote negative review for this book, and it was taking down without even letting me know. I guess enlightened author does not like bad reviews. I've been there and done that, and I can guarantee you, that it will not lead you to unity with True Light.Want to try be my guest, but it is my responsibility to warn you."
5,Everybody Loves Somebody!,"Excellent toy! Sings two songs, mouth moves to the words, and he dances, too. Plus it's really Dino singing."
2,Toy doesn't work,"Dean Martin doll plays the music, but mouth doesn't move and arm moves sometimes but not others. Would have liked to have known this before I made the purchase."
2,Disappointed!,I'm disappointed because my daughter has no interest in this set at all. But she loves the Volume II collection.
3,Not my favorite Boynton...,"We enjoy many of Sandra Boynton's books and the only one that we really love from this set is Oh My Oh My Oh Diansours!The others are okay, but not as good as many of her others."
5,We love Boynton!,Sandra Boynton is a great children's book author who has created wonderful books! My whole family loves them and they are part of everyone's children book libraries!
1,Pointless Book Lulls Students to Sleep!,"Unfortunatly I was required to read this atrocious book for school. I am a very forgiving student when it come to books that are dull, but this one drove me past my limit. The examples are outdated and pointless. There are too many references to dreag racing and silverware.Granted she might have some good points but you can't see them because they are buried so deeply in her ramblings. It was THE MOST BORING BOOK I have ever read!! It was difficult staying awake.This torture may have been worthwhile if there was something to be learned. Unfortunately there is nothing to be learned!!!You could condense the book down to ONE sentence- Writing is important, like drag racing, and never say the word there. Okay thats the book.I just saved you 7 bucks and the pain of deciphering the boring words in MICROSCOPIC PRINT. Ilearned as much froim her book as I do from SWEDISH PROPAGANDA that i do not understand.Only Swedish propaganda wasd more interseting!!"
1,half moon,Never have I been this dissatisfied with a Columbia product. This item has an uncomfortable fit. TERRIBLE. It's the last thing I'll buy from this brand.
3,too large.,"I think the medium shorts were missized, because I have several medium columbia shorts and they all fit perfectly."
4,SNIKT!!!,"I got this one on ebay for more than this awesome price, so buy it off amazon now!This wolverine is the best comic wolverne ever made. there is no other like it.1. his claws are great, i think it's good that they are soft an flexible becuase if you wanted them hard plastic you'd be crying after you broke his claws.2. the base is very dramatic and you can put him in a variety of berserker poses, and claws scratches aree a great touch.3.this is my best marvel legend figure, this may be my only Marvel Legend without the weak ankles so he supports himself pretty well.for a while his right knee wouldn't bend all the way from the paint that hardend it but I beneded it an got scared that i broke it but i fixed it actually.Also, THIS Wolverine is just as awesome as any of those X-men movie Wolverine's out there. Those movie versions don't really have a good enough likeness to Hugh Jackman and the claws are short an terrible.For the true Wolvierine fan, do yourself a favor and get this pronto!"
1,not as good as it looked,"I was looking for an alternative to using dirty nasty potholders, and this looked so clean and easy. But as has been noted before, the 4 finger part is ok, but I have small hands and even with just the small gripper, I can barely hang on to a cookie sheet without my hand coming out of the gripper, the thumb part needs to be made lots smaller. I still think the idea is a good one, I like clean simple items, but I havn't seemed to master hanging on with one hand. Using two, one for each hand at the same time, would probably work lots better."
1,Rusty,"This item was rusty when I got it. I got it as a gift, but obviously couldn't give a rusty hammer as a gift."
3,"Looks great, but...","The pictures in this book are wonderful, however, our success rate is 0.5 out of 4 for the experiments. I am sure many of the experiments will work, but not the ones we selected. Many of the experiments are quite elaborate, so unless your child is very ambititous, you will be doing quite alot of work."
1,Boring,"Okay, I'm not a member of MENSA, but I love games like Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne which require strategy and thought so I'm not a complete mental turnip, either. The problem with Khet is that it's a lot like chess, which has certain traditional opening moves, but with Khet nobody tells you what those are, and unless you're the type of person who really enjoys spending a lot of time just figuring out how to play - as opposed to actually playing - this game will bore the hell out of you."
4,"Good as a historical contribution, but a quite dated book.","Scriven is one of the ""grandfathers"" of evaluation and it does provide background that quite a number of writers refer to. One of the three copies I ordered had a price tag stuck to the cover that was difficult to remove; one price label was impossible to remove; one cover was in pristine condition.Don"
2,mistakes mistakes mistakes,"Differences between the mathematical examples shown and what's written in the accompanying text seem to be a trademark of Fabozzi books. This book is no exception. There were mistakes from the very beginning and, though I am currently only halfway through the book, I have not stopped encountering more of them. The text is reasonably explanatory albeit somewhat elementary but the amount of mathematical errors is astonishing. Difficult to recommend this book unless you enjoy solving puzzles (ie trying to figure out what the correct numbers are, based on the text)."
5,Classic Film,"I almost passed on this title after I saw the negative review, but I decided to take a flyer on it. This is a great program. Its a 1960's production. It's obvious from the cinemtaography and costumes. But I like that style in bible epics, sort of reminds me of Ben Hur. Besides, its not like the story/plot changed. A great value, almost 6 hours of DVD for about $6. It's great to share with kids or in a Sunday school class."
3,Had to send it back.,"My son was very excited to receive this train engine but we had to send it back. To insert the batteries you need a very long and thin screwdriver to get into the deep hole where the small screw is. Nothing we had worked, the screw was in very tight and we could not get the battery compartment open. We had to send it back, and he settled for a Thomas brand engine instead (which worked just as well and was a little less expensive.)"
3,Help I'm Stuck!,"This engine is great fun ... as long as you don't use it on BRIO's own train tracks. The locomotive is bright red, it toots and whistles and has two headlights that will brighten up your kid's eyes. Unfortunately, it also needs lots of handholding, because it gets stuck quite often. In curves, especially going in reverse and up hills. The mighty red locomotive is a little too mighty and could use a slimming diet. I'm returning mine. A much better choice is the yellow engine which is also battery driven ... and uses just one AAA battery."
4,One of there less durable products,"I was completely disappointed at how short of a time it lasted in our house with my 2 year old son. It did not make it up the hills and seemed to lose power very quickly. We had purchased the smaller of the two battery powered locomotives previously so I was expecting a little more quality out of this one. I have to say that the smaller engine was much stronger and more durable than the larger more expensive one. We are going back to the smaller one, which lasted months instead of days. Yet another expensive purchase down the drain :("
2,When the Wind Blows,A fantastic book so real.....however the copy I received wasn't in very good condition - the spin was all broken so I was a bit disappointed in this....the first time I have received a book in such condition.
2,Not the best of the k-cup flavors,"I do love my Keurig coffee machine, and have sampled a wide variety of coffee flavors they offer. This one is NOT one of my favorites. It's acidic, and that overpowers the vanilla and coffee flavors. You can do much better. The two best I've tried so far are Green Mountain Wild Mountain Blueberry and Gloria Jean's Mudslide (chocolatey). If vanilla is your favorite flavor, I would try the Green Mountain or Gloria Jean version, or one of the others."
4,Light flavor and tasted a bit too sweet for me but my wife liked it!,We tried some of this in our new Keurig coffee maker and it was just OK. This is a lighter brewed cup of coffee with a very sweet taste. It was so sweet that I actually ate a small bit of food with it and it made the coffee taste better to me as it took the sweet edge off of the flavor. I gave it a 4 star rating as my wife loved it but for me it was a 3 or four star.I could drink it without problems but it is not my favorite. It was a smooth flavor and not bitter but the vanilla flavor was a little light. You may have to cut back on any sweetener if you use any. I brewed a medium cup size of coffee. I posted a photo of the K-Cup.
2,Finish peels off,"I loved the look of these and the heavy weight. Brass workings. However, the finish peeled off. I bought mine (2 of them) at Sam's and they had to refund my money since they didn't have anymore in stock. I had spoken with the manufactures warranty dept and they said to take them back to Sams for a replacement. That's all they would do."
1,Illustrations are superfluous,"I could've done without the illustrations in this edition of the Elements of Style. Also, they've put the page numbers on the inside margins of the pages. So if you look up a reference in the index, you then have to open the book wide to find the page number, which should be placed on the outer margin where it's easy to spot as you flip through.All I wanted was the Elements of Style, which is a great book. I'll buy the normal edition. This one is irritating."
5,Fun Addition to a Classic,The Maira Kalman illustrations are a delightful addition to the fine writing advice of William Strunk and E.B. White. Will the playful paintings aid in your pursuit of writing greatness obtained from reading these pages? YES!Strunk and White teach us how to write well and thoughtfully. Kalman's wonderful illustrations demonstrate that writing without an attitude of joy is simply dull.
2,Lost In Translation,"I have this Allman Brothers Band performance in VHS format, and it is amazing. A really classic performance featuring Greg Allman, Dickey Betts, Warren Hayes, Allen Woody and the rest. What a major disappointment with this transer to DVD. While the DVD format gives great color and resolution, there is a deluge of unsavory editing. In the middle of key live performances, interviews are spliced in. (...)But the real travesty is the omission of material from the VHS version, and the rolling of credits while the band blazes on Whippin' Post. This great song is literally cut short in mid-performance. The potential for a great presentation in the DVD format is lost in the editing. The running time claimed is ""approx. 90 minutes"", while it actually is less than 60 minutes. Sloppy job Sony!!!"
1,What a letdown.,"I am a big Allman Brothers fan, having enjoyed and loved their music since 1970, so I was very disappointed when several songs were interrupted with interview material. The performances were fine, unfortunately, in those instances I wasn't given the privilage of hearing entire songs. DVD technology allows for re-editing this material so that the interviews are put in a separate menu. I would very much like to enjoy the original concert the way it was recorded, not as a re-issue of the TV program. There is a great opportunity to give the listener something better. Luckily, I was able to return this title because the running time was incorrectly listed on the box as much longer than it really is."
2,wish they would have copied the vhs version,"Long time Allman Bros. fan. I own the ""Live at Great Woods VHS"" and was excited to purchase the DVD. I am disappointed with the interruptions and interviews during several of the songs. ""Blue Sky"" hardly exist due to an interview with Dickey Betts. It just appears that this recording was hurried and it is much shorter than the original VHS tape. I would purchase the tape instead of the DVD. Bummer...."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I've been an Allman Brothers Band fan for over 25 years & have rarely been disapointed by their releases. This is a poor production of a great concert. I have the original VHS of this show and it is spectacular. They really blew it with the DVD.I was expecting additional concert footage that didn't make it to the VHS, interviews, extras...Instead we get massive edits, partial songs, songs interupted by interviews.Hopefully the band will have this show re-released properly. When they do, they should offer a trade-in for this poor excuse of a DVD.Meanwhile, the VHS is superb!"
2,INTERVIEW TALK RIGHT OVER THE MUSIC,Some of the guitar solo's have the band members answering a interviewer's question's right over them. What were they thinking when they made this video? It is not worth the money. Just more poor quality by the Music Industry Weasel's Whitch proves once again anything for a buck!
2,Good music marred by terrible production,"DVD has tremendous potential for music. While few movies are worth more than a single viewing, a good music video bears repeating. This DVD is about as bad as they come. Too much talk, not enough music. A voiceover is presented during ""Blue Sky"", which has one of my favorite AB's guitar solos. Most upsetting is that the closing credits are displayed while the band plays ""Whipping Post""."
2,What idiot edited this?,"It makes me sad when I see somebody making a lot of money to do a terrible job of something. Whatever morons were in charge of the editing decided that the people who buy a concert DVD don't want to hear the actual concert. Blue Sky is one of my favorite songs ever; imagine my frustration when I skip to that track to see 2 minutes of an awesome Blue Sky turned way down in the background while Dickie talks about Statesboro Blues over top of it. Don't buy this, you'll just get mad."
5,Johnny Cash CD Murder,"I rented this CD from the Library and fell in love and purchased the cd. Well written songs specifically dealing with poverty, prison system, captial punishment, suicide, man's inhumanity to man."
4,I know that God in Heaven looked down,"This is a collection of religious songs by Johnny Cash, personally selected by Cash himself. The earliest song is from 1957 (one of the few religious songs he was allowed to record for Sun Records) and the most recent song is from 1996 (his second American Recordingsalbum). This is good music that should appeal to Johnny Cash's fans, especially his Christian fans. You can tell his religious convictions are heartfelt when you hear him sing these songs. Recommended to Johnny Cash fans."
5,Awesome reveal-ations from the premier perrenialist,"Schuon is often a wonderfully complex author, and much is translated from French or German. If you have the patience, his work will never fail to amaze you with the new light refracted from a jewel you had convinced yourself you'd seen from all conceivable angles. He deals in foundations, and any modernist or self-proclaimed secular skeptic or atheist must grapple with his presentations of the Primordial Tradition. This book is a diverse and gripping introduction to his work and incredible mind."
2,dining chairs,"I was so excited when I received my new chairs. The were easy to put together and look beautiful. The durability of the chairs is questionable. You can not put much weight on the backs of the chairs while sitting. Both of my chairs broke. It is almost like the pegs used in the assembly are cheap. They actually break into a dusty mess. Which is kind of ironic, because the tag said that they are ""fine furniture"". If I knew that the chairs were so cheap, I would have not purchased them."
4,Nice,"The chairs are great, the finish is beautiful and I love the x on the back. Very easy to put together and if I want to recover the chair it should be no big deal."
1,I cannot rate as I have not purchased.,"For over $18.00, you do not give the quantity of cans one will purchase. I'm sure one can does not cost that much. Thank you, Iva Jeane Driggers"
5,Education the easy way.,This was referred to me before a trip to Ireland. It was great easy to read and at the same time gave me a great background to Irish history.Many of the charters are real and they are based on their own writings and facts about their lives. A great read for any one who likes history.
5,Touches Many Feelings Through A Compelling Story,"Llwelyn captures a period in contemporary Irish history integrating fictional major characters with those who fought for Home Rule in Ireland. It's a compelling story which makes setting aside the book a difficult challenge. Ned and Caitlin bring to life a story about being Irish, being Catholic, being separated by the Atlantic, the loss of parents on the Titanic, and fighting for a free Erie. While we know, from history the outcome of the fight for freedom, the story rivets our attention because the all characters capture us and our emotions. The best book read in 1998!! You'll love it, whether you're Irish, Catholic or not."
4,Excellent read!,"Once you get past the contrived beginning, this is a wonderful book. I would highly recommend it to all lovers of Irish history."
