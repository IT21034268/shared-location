4,Wonderful,"I have to agree with another reviewer about the recolection of what happened to a 3 year old, but all in all we can remember what we are told from family members! Besides that I could not put this book down, you wanted to learn how Jeanette Walls overcame all that she lived through. It is an amazing account of her life as she remembers it. A must read."
4,Couldn't put this down!,Jeannette Walls pens an intriguing story. I was drawn to the plight of her and her siblings.
5,The Glass Castle,"Best book I have read in years. More authors should write like this. She doesn't try to impress you with her vocabulary. Easy to read and holds your interest from beginning to end without any rest stops. If non-fiction is your bag, this is your treat."
5,Simply amazing!,This was such an emotional read. I quickly became completely absorbed in the content and experienced a range of emotions. What an amazing life experience. This is an absolute MUST read!
4,Dysfunction,"I normally don't read memoirs, but a friend passed this book along and she said it was a good read...The complete dysfunction of this family was described with such detail... It really makes you appreciate things like indoor plumbing, and mattresses.... Oh yes and the fact that we eat FOOD not only once a day but MANY times a day. I can't imagine allowing my children to suffer the way Jeannette's mother did. This book wasn't written way back when they did without, but rather a modern day current event taking place in the 70's to now.... I really had to just keep reading because I couldn't wait to see what this family would next..."
4,Life isn't fair,"I've read this book twice, and enjoyed it, and believed it, too. Everybody's entitled to their opinion, but I can't help thinking that the reviewers who didn't like this book 'disapproved' of the parents and are upset by the idea that a 'bad' parent can be loved by a child. There are people like Rex who have the kind of personality that can seduce a child in spite of the growing awareness, as the child grows older, that things are not as they should be. You can also be as worthy as anything and be quite uninspiring ! Incidentally not all his children were as infatuated as the writer, with whom he created as special relationship. I'm not American, nor do I live in the States but I have no trouble in believing this memoir."
5,Remarkable story - enjoyed writing style,"Jeannette Walls' account of her childhood was engrossing. I am amazed at this account of how these siblings were able to ""raise"" themselves and remain so positive and become contributing members of society. The book read easily - I enjoyed her journalistic style. I recommend it highly"
5,Wonderful,"Wow...what a wonderful read. I couldn't put it down. Ms.Walls tells her very troubling life story with a sense of grace and humor. Instead of feeling sad, as I read, I was really uplifted. She is a very talented writer. I hope we see more, whether non-fiction or fiction."
4,"Well written, compelling story","Really, you can't make this stuff up. This reads true, and reads as easily as if you were reading a novel. Jeannette Walls has recreated her trying and hardscrabble years of growing up, illustrating all the poverty and desperation, yet also including the humanity and the love. Recommended."
2,This was a hard read.,"We read this book in our book club, and I found it difficult to read. I felt so sorry for the children because the parents were so awful. The children became very strong and independent from the lack of parenting, but it could have very easily gone bad for them. I just wanted to wring the parent's necks. The children had no childhood, whatsoever. The book was well written, and she does love her parents and has forgiven them. I did finish it, but it is not a book that I would have read outside of my book club. Bravo to Jeannette to have risen above her chaotic beginnings."
3,OK book,"There were obviously some creative liberties taken while writing this memoir, but it's still an OK book. The writing style is a bit timid but, again, OK. To all those who ""hated"" the book because it's sad or depressing, read a happy pick-me-up. The truth of the matter is, for the most part, I believe that this was Jeannette Walls' life, to the best of her recollection and it was awful. The author didn't condemn her parents, but clearly disapproved of their behaviour. Don't condemn her as an author for not throwing her parents under the bus.Again, if you want fluffy, sunshine and puppy dogs reading, go somewhere else."
4,You Can't Help Those Who Don't Want To Be Helped,"This book is very entertaining, but really disturbing at times. The four Walls children endured an awful childhood by anyone's standard and they were survivors in every sense of the word. Their parents made some foolish decisions, no doubt, but Walls doesn't make them sound entirely stupid either. This book should hopefully make you realize that you can't help people that don't want to be helped."
4,The Glass Castle- How to let your parents go,"I love my parents but I don't like their living situation. For years it bothered me I could do nothing about it- they wouldn't let me. The Glass Castle is a story of abuse and neglect and yet Jeannette Walls still loved her parents when she was finally grown, had found success and was far away from them. Then there they were, in her city, living homeless and poor. She learned to let them live as they chose so she could go on living her own life. She's a remarkable person."
4,Good but have some doubts,"This book was recommended by a friend. I read it without knowing what it was about, and did not know it was fiction until after I was part way through it and decided to research it. I have to say I enjoyed the story, however, find it a little difficult to believe that Jeannette could remember in such detail the events that occurred when she was as young as 3 yrs. old. (A bit unbelievable for me). I also found it sad that she continued to deny her own feelings right into adulthood. Can someone really love their parents that much that they continue to forgive the disfuntionalism right into adulthood? And shame on society for allowing those children to continue to be abused by their own parents throughout their entire childhood years, especially in a country such as ours. I rated this book a 4, but would be hesitant to read more by this author, the story was good but I didn't enjoy the way in which it was written."
4,A must read!!,This book is an inspiration for anyone who needs to be inspired and for anyone who has everything or nothing. What a brave little girl....what a spectacular woman!! I cannot verbally judge the parents. I will let you draw your own conclusions.
4,Amazing book,I planned on reading this a little bit at a time and ended up staying up till 3:30am until I finished it. Amazing and powerful story of children's resilience and ingenuity when their parents are irresponsible.
1,OMG the worst!!!!,"Ok if you're into a depressing account of someones childhood, buy it!! This book lacked a lot! It's horrible event after another. Things like falling out of cars, and eating out of bathroom garbage cans. It's horrible! I'm sorry, but please save your $9.99."
5,Honest & Inspiring,"Superbly written - a page turner. Style is straightforward, concise and creates a wonderful quick paced story in the head of the reader.I found it brave that Ms. Walls was unapologetticaly honest in her memoir - she doesn't really make too many judgments about her parents or upbringing - she just tells it like it was, and we the readers can discuss our judgments with others that read the book.Her lack of bitterness is also inspiring , in that Ms. Walls is obviously a ""survivor"" - and instead of allowing all the many things that could have led her to a life of bitterness and failure - she allowed those things to create in her a resourcefulness and strength of character to overcome them.This is on my High School daughter's summer reading list - a fantastic choice that will provide many thought provoking themes to discuss. The greatest of which I hope is the power to overcome anything & life is all the way you look at it."
3,Disturbing but also Entertaining,"Every memoir is only one side of the story - the author's. Jeannette Walls life was a challenge to say the least. Clearly both parents had emotional issues. Poverty was a large part of her youth and there were varying levels of abuse - emotional, pyschological, neglect.But with every memoir I always take it with a grain of salt. As sensational as some moments in her memoir were, I was question their accuracy.If nothing else, even if only 1/2 of her novel is true, Jeannette has overcome a horrifying childhood. By the end, it doesn't sound like she has emotionally moved beyond what happened to her, but she does go on with her life.I can't say I would whole heartedly recommend this. Most of it is like any other heart breaking memoir about a sad childhood, absent/abusive parents, and overcoming it all."
5,Going through hell and back.,"I loved this book and the way the author talked as a child and what a child thinks. One favorite passage is her belief that if she painted the house...the neighbors would see it and all would come and join. It's a true moment in a child's heart. ""If I do this..."" mind."
5,Awesome book!,"The story started a little slow, but when it took off, I couldn't put it down. I can only imagine the courage it took to write and re-live the events that took place. I have recommended this book to everyone I know!!"
4,A great DVD with great Matches!!!!!!,"This Pay Per View event had some awesome matches{especially the Lingerie match!!!!}some of the matches was the Triple Threat match and that was awesome!!!But I think the best match out of the whole show was the Ladder match with Edge against Christian because that match was so breathtaking,I kept on watching that match over and over again{except for the Lingerie match Wow!!!}So what I'am trying to say is that you have to get this DVD!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I Love me some LL!!!,"I own all his albums. ALL OF THEM. Now I'm not going to sit here and act like they are all good. They aren't. He can boast about being the GREATEST OF ALL TIMES....LL has longetvity and is the man who can do those smooth raps that the ladies love!!! Throw Your L's up, Big Mamma (makes me all teary eyed), Mirror, Mirror, Niggy Nuts, and fa ha show why he is the Greatest!!! ..."
3,This should be LL's final album...,"LL Cool J is a hip hop legend and that's just plain and simple. The problem with most legends is that they don't know when to quit. Look at Mike Jordan. Ok, i got a little off the subject but LL has put his stamp on the rap game. 10 is not a great album by know means but you can listen to it every once in a while. Tracks like ""10 Million Stars"" and ""Clocking G's"" make me feel good about Mr. Smith but the rest of the CD is filled with commercial R&B tracks. True hip hop heads such as myself don't check for albums like this but LL Cool J still gets love for the effort. The Rap icon should relax now and reap the benefits of being one of the pioneers of this music genre."
4,Good,"This is a very good album. LL has stayed hot for an extremely long time. He has evolved with rap since the 80s, and can still make club bangers. So Amazing and Paradise are great songs, and they showcase LL's ability to write love ballads, which he has been doing ever since 'I Need Love'. A very good album."
1,Complete waste of my time!!,"Please, don't spend your time or money on this book. I struggled through waiting for the plot twist that would lead to the point of this book. It never came. The characters were vague and so underdeveloped that I couldn't quite decide who was likeable and who wasn't. Even the ending was unsatisfying. It ended so abruptly that at first I thought maybe I was missing the last chapter. This is the first and last book I purchase by this author!"
1,terrible book,"The writing itself was plain sloppy, and boring. She went into way too many details about things that didn't really matter. Her characters were weak, at best. And the format of her writing was just distracting, as she speaks in many voices... most often from a 3rd removed person, stating facts, like it was some sort of recipie. Just plain horrible... save your money..."
4,Does what it says on the tin,"These arrived well packed, and were easy to open and use one at a time safely. My cube now has more pictures of my kids than anyone else's has of their kids, and these clips make sticking them to the wall an easy task. The colors are a bit first gen iMac-ish, so I guess there's some nostalgia there. On the other hand, they aren't so bright that they distract from my pictures."
2,Grammar Lesson?,"I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Crutcher and have him sign any book from a large selection available at the signing. I chose Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes at random. The book started off well enough but I immediately was puzzled at some of the wording found within the text. Many sentences were quite awkward to read. My wife and I are both educators and were amazed at the poor sentence structure and vernacular used throughout. Many of the words I have never heard in the vocabulary of someone in their late teens (which is the age of the protagonist in the story). As the book wears on, Mr. Crutcher feels the need the raise the number of curse words per page. Seriously, in one particular chapter, the characters seems as if they have just discovered the word s***. The storyline about friendships changing as peer groups and personas evolve is a familiar, but welcome one. My fault is not with the ""message"" but the way the message is delivered."
2,The liberal stance doesn't annoy me; the poor writing does,"Probably the reason kids read this book in so many schools is they want to get these tough issues out on the table for discussion. That's great, but when an author is relying on controversy to sell his books, it starts to turn sour. The writing is nothing memorable, the flash-backs are confusing, and Eric is EXACTLY the same as all Crutcher's other heroes. Egotistical, athletically gifted and otherwise made of cardboard. Sarah is a slightly more interesting person, but Crutcher tries to make her an enigma by making her do out of character, confusing, motive-less things. All in all, if you want a WELL WRITTEN book that deals with the same issues, read A CATCHER IN THE RYE."
1,I didn't like it..,"I didn't like this book. It was too weird and spooky for me. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it! Still, my friend read it and enjoyed it, so maybe I'm paranoid. Give it a try and see what you think-if you don't like it after 4 chapters, then stop reading it!"
2,AVOID THIS BOOK!,"If you want a book that has action, than this might be OK for you. But this is the most horribly written book that I have ever read. The characters are not convincing(the main character, Eric Calhoune, uses 18 year old slang, and occasionallly speaks like a phsycologist-very contradictory)and the writing is just BAD. The entire book is a puny cover up for Crutcher to get his ideas out. If you want anything that is remotely well crafted, go to another book."
4,The Kobayashi Report,The music on this CD is really nice. It is worth getting for any fan of Final Fantasy.
2,"Excellent music, not a very good recording.","While a fairly decent recording of Verdi's Requiem, I can't terribly reccomend it. The dynamics are a bit flat, and it robs the piece of much of it's impressive character. Good, but much better recordings exist."
1,Don't call it a documentary,"Maher raises some good points in this movie, but is arguably more stubborn in his own disbelief than the faithful are in their beliefs. Maher mostly wants to make fun of people in ill-humored jokes and make them look stupid by means of tricky editing and loaded questions. People such as Benjamin Franklin are misquoted. These things can be very deceptive. Bill Maher likes to think he knows everything that's in the Bible, but he doesn't, and therefore puts out false or inaccurate information which he then presents as fact. Maher has some decent conversations with some people, but more often he talks over them or cuts them off before they have a chance to provide a legitimate answer to his questions. If you like to watch people get poked fun at because of their beliefs, you may enjoy this film. If your looking to gain some kind of insight, I don't recommend it."
4,Bill Maher strikes again!,"I have been a fan of Bill Maher's for awhile now. I find that our thoughts about religion and politics match almost 100%, so I try to follow on his work and make up for a lost time, ie time when I didn't know about him and his works. This disc is one of missing links so I bought it in a heartbeat.PROs:* Bill Maher in his usual mood to take on on religious nuts.* Various religious figures being put through some hard questions they don't have answers for.* Wit and humor striking against bigotry and ignorance. Hurray!CONs:* Too short. But I guess he needs to leave some material for other discs / shows.In truth, Bill Maher is saying what everybody else should know instinctively - that religion is pulling us down in the muck and that humanity will never truly be free unless we stop turning to religion for answers instead looking for them ourselves.Although short, this disc is something you will watch from start to end and over and over again. It's a good purchase folks."
1,Laughable,"Never seen a documentary from this guy before but his ""facts"" are hysterical. I bet you most religious scholars (or any scholar, or any person who isn't a trucker and has a high school degree, or maybe anyone with just a brain and mouth, could make a better argument for atheism. This is just a lesson of what happens when, as Skip Bayless would say, ""You didn't do your homework!"""
4,Somewhat,This movie was really opinionated. I watched this movie with an open mind and i didnt't get mad. Points were made and points were shot down.
3,Religulous,"Bill Maher drove right by my home,on Hwy 152 in this movie,and was in my own town of Rockwell NC....I thought the movie would be more of a movie about Atheism,but he let the religious folks hang themselves,with their own fairy tales..."
1,I expect more,"I thouth this it would be a funny documental, but instead it just a comedian (but not funny at all in this) trying to make fun of differents religions. Is there something religulous or I should say ridiculous is this documental..."
4,"""I Kid God"" ....","Bill is not as nasty on the subject of religion as you might expect....This Movie has more of a Mocking Tone than Angry. You can't help but laugh at the people Bill picked out to defend Religion....they serve as fodder for Maher. Enjoy the scene when 2 Defenders of the Faithtell Bill they don't beleive anyone is born Gay.... Bill responds, ""You don't?....have you ever seen Little Richard !?! Good Movie. Bill on his game."
5,Bill can cut right through the bull in religion with his sharp wit,Bill's sharp tongue and quick wit just cut through all the BS of religon. Unfortunately too many people are shackled by their faith to understand this movie
2,"Sorry, Bill!","Actually, I probably would have watched the rest of it but my wife said she knew all of this and got bored! So we have to give it two stars even though Bill is usually much more entertaining."
2,Pretentious,"Yes, Bill. We get it. Humans cannot prove God exists. Throughout this movie, Bill will successfully drive this point home. I like ""Real Time,"" and also enjoy Bill's standup. He is funny, and this movie is too. What I didnt like was the complete lack of respect in certain scenes (particularly the scene involving the small baptist church in a trailer). He barges up to the altar, slamming his hands down, telling them there is no God. I guess its just me, because this movie got a lot of great reviews, but what he did there totally turned me off for the rest of the movie. It's a funny movie, Bill is obviously smart and talks to many interesting characters."
5,Courageous,"I loved this movie. Bill Maher has the guts to ask the questions and say the things that are on the minds of many freethinkers. Editing, I am sure, enhanced some humorous parts but there was much thought provoking humor throughout this film that was not the result of creative editing. Religious people often dig themselves into a hole that they can't get out of, and it is laughable. Unfortunately, it is still very unacceptable to not believe the ridiculous. Hats off to Bill for his bravery. I hope that this movie makes reason more acceptable."
1,Done in Poor Taste,"I watched the first 10 minutes of this movie and turned it off.Bill Maher is a vulgar moron. I would have preferred an intelligent discussion of religion without references to masturbating and the F word, it adds nothing of value to the film."
5,"Bill Maher Rocks,Fantastic Documentary!!!","Religulous is one hell of a great movie,it should have been nominated for an Oscar!To all you jesus freaks & haters out there,you need to just get a life.Put your bibles down,grow up & reconnect with the universe.Its not all about you and your religion.Personally,i grew up catholic and had all these same questions bill asked in this movie.I do believe in a higher power,but i do not believe in stupidity & hate as most organized religions do."
3,could function more smoothly,"The video works fine. However, it makes the DVD player shake which has never happened to me before."
4,Using logic and humor,"Bill gets to the heart of the issues about religious indoctrination. Everyone is succeptable, if only we were taught logic before religion, instead of the other way around."
1,"We get it Maher, enough already","Gee, this movie was such a surprise! I mean, who could have guessed that Maher the Bigot has a problem with organized religion. It's not enough that he has a disdain for people who practice their religion, he makes a movie mocking those same people because they haven't seen the ""light"" of Maher's featherweight logic. Maher was the kid in junior high that always had something to say, but could barely write his own name. Nary an original thought has passed from his brain to his mouth or in this case, his fingers. Listening to any counter arguments results in Maher using those same fingers to plug his ears and sing ""la la la"" much like the emotional 2 year old he is. I don't mind giving this film one star because while I was watching it, I was able to take a nice nap. A great cure for insomnia. THANKS BILL!"
1,Sad commentary,"While I agree with much of the agnostic sentiment in the piece, it adds nothing the discussion by taking advantage of those unable to defend themselves. Unfortunately Bill Maher takes up the same tactics that are employed by right wing gas-bags like Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh. They repeatedly take on 'adversaries' who are neither well-spoken nor well-informed. Although I delighted in his making a fool of one Southern Senator, I was embarrassed to watch most of other interviewees. I'm afraid Maher has fallen into the hands of the religious right who refuse to agree that ""freedom of religion"" also means ""freedom FROM religion."" They could use this film as proof of the ""God-less Left"" who are attacking American values. Giving them such a tool is truly is the devil's work. Skip this one."
1,Waste of Time,"I used to find Bill Maher funny, but now he's just angry and hateful. Its very sad.I'd skip this one and anything else he is involved with. I know I will."
1,Straw men and lose facts,"Most of this film involves attacks on easy targets or attempts to mock decent people. One of the more outrageous claims, that Jesus is just a result of plagarism is based on utter crap: See [...]."
4,Quite funny and informative,The movie was good but of course very one sided. It made quite a few good points about religion.
5,FIRST Nice watch,"Great watch. I got it for my 18th birthday and its been absolutely great, fits nicely, is really accurate. The lumes are really bright and last a long time. It is perfect for my wrist, its not too big or too small. I love it :D"
5,Lots of bang for the buck,"This watch has cool styling and is easy to read even in darkness due to the luminous dial, but the fit and finish are top quality all around. The canvas strap has an inner water resistant layer to keep it from soaking up perspiration. The watch case has a high polish equal to Swiss standards, possibly even better. This is a no-nonsense watch which tells the time very accurately, never needs winding or a battery and looks good. It's just simply reliable and a great value for the price."
1,date adjustment feature failed,"I purchased this watch about 6 months ago. With this kind of watch, after any month with fewer than 31 days in it, the number in its day-of-the-month window must be manually reset to '1', in order for it to display the correct numbers during the following month. Today (at the beginning of December) when attempting to reset that number, I discovered that its date-resetting function no longer operates. While I've owned this watch, it hasn't been subjected to any trauma. The failure of its date adjustment feature seems to have been a spontaneous failure, in other words, which suggests to me that this model's mechanism for adjusting the date is of poor quality."
4,"Love it, but photos need update.","I own too many watches to admit owning, here. The Citizen Eco-Drive is one of my favorite product lines. I love my new watch; but, one of the photos on this site gives the impression that the reflectivity of the metal case IS NOT shiny--it appears to have a dull surface texture in one of the photos, which is my preference. No big deal really. I'm an averaged size male, and the band is a bit small (this model marketed to children, or women, perhaps?) I'll probably replace it with a velcro strap. Go Citizen!!!"
4,Good deal,"I needed a new everyday watch and for many reasons I selected this Citizen watch. Reasonably priced, nice looking. Keeps perfect time -- I just watched the second hand come to the top of the dial and just as it hit that point the clock on my computer changed the minute -- I set it two weeks ago. The no winding, no having to be aware of the self-winding mechanism, is great."
5,Great Watch,"Watch is amazing, solar power and the strap fits nice. you could also add military straps that look nice also"
4,Just what I was looking for,"When I started watch shopping, I wanted a tough, casual, and analog watch. The fact that it is solar powered is a plus. Previous watches that I have owned became ruined for not replacing the battery soon enough, and this watch takes care of that problem. On a sunny day I will leave it on the window sill to charge. I have owned it for a little over a month now and it is only about 1.5 seconds fast. I plan on resetting it when I have to readjust the date once every 2 months. The seconds hand does not line up exactly with the tick markings, but for my day to day use, it is not a big problem. Youll be hard strapped to find a watch for [...] bucks that does not have this problem. My previous watches didnt even have a seconds hand. Most people dont like the canvas band, but I happen to like it. The face seems to be pretty tough. There are no scratches at all, not even little ones. I am very happy with the watch."
4,nice watch,"i am very pleased with the watch. it is first classthe band, however was cheap and i replaced it immediatelyit was overall a very good buy"
5,great watch,Great watch. Little more chrome on the face and green in the strap than the original picture but it is awesome. It runs on the sun people!
4,watch review,Nice watch for the money. I thought it looked very military. My only issue was the crappy band it comes with. The watch band is rather short and will require an aftermarket band so that I can wear it. I recommend it with the exception of the band on the watch.
3,Review,"Overall quality ok. Watch band is heavy, uncomfortable and difficult to use quickly. Watch thickness is an issue for me when wearing dress shirts."
5,"I love this watch, looks expensive, high quality","I love this watch! It is the perfect size for women. I always prefer mens watches and I love military style bands. The band is a military green color and is awesome! The rivets are really cool. The watch looks very expensive like a swiss, and doesnt look like it costs a few hundred dollars. I love that it charges itself with the sun! It is a much better choice than an IWC or a much more expensive watch because of this self charging feature. The black face is stunning and the time is really easy to read. A black or a red band would look great on it. It is also very light and thin and sits very flat on my wrist."
5,Top Notch Watch,"This is my work watch, it keeps good time with no batteries or winding. It's thin and sharp looking, I like the easy to read simple face. Just place it under a lamp when it arrives, let it charge as per directions. It's a five star to me."
4,"Great watch, classic design, but fell short on the band","I've had this watch for a couple weeks and really like it. I wanted something simple with classic design characteristics and I think Citizen hit the nail on the head with the BM8180-03E. I love the fact that I never have to replace the battery, although it may take a week or so to fully charge the watch if you spend most of your days indoors. The one thing I didn't like, hence 4 stars instead of 5 was the band. It was rigid, small(circumference) with riveted holes which you can't really see in the picture. I purchased a new Zulu 18mm 2 ring band which is very comfortable and much better looking."
3,Good watch but....,"First of all, I have to agree with the minor complaints people posted.1. The watch is too shiny, making it look cheap.2. The wrist band it not wide enough. And the distance between the grommets are too far apart.3. The shiny watch and the dull gray wrist band don't watch. Why couldn't they make everything the same color?I sort of knew what I was buying. So I thought. I paid attention to the ""not-glowing"" reviews and looked at the pictures, but the pictures don't show how shiny this thing really is. Functionally, it's a good watch, but not very discreet to wear. Now that I have it on my wrist, I would have bought another model."
4,As expected.,"A nice watch for the money. It's definitely not worth the $135 USD that Citizen lists it for on their site. Overall it's rugged and accurate. I'm not a second counter so I don't know exactly how accurate it is, but it gets me around on time. The band took a little getting used to. I'm not crazy about the metal eyelets on the band, but they'll do as I can't find a better canvas band out there. (I'm currently looking for a good hemp band in a khaki color.) I like the black face and large numbers. The date is accurate and easy to read.Not perfect, but for only paying half price, it's a lot better than a Fossil or Timex."
4,"Nice, plain watch","I like the watch. The band is a little on the casual side, but changing it could dress the watch up considerably. I like the straightforward, simple black face with clear numbers, nice visibility at night. And the solar power should be fine."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I was looking for a stainless steel watch with a simple functional dial. This Citizen Eco-Drive met my requirements and at an affordable price. I would have liked it to have had a matching stainless steel watch band but that would have added to the cost. I have had the watch for more than six months now, and it works perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase and as usual Amazon came through with what I was looking for with excellent service."
2,Seconds hand does not index and band is poorly made.,Just got mine two days ago and I am very disappointed that the seconds hand does not index with the minute markings. It makes the watch appear cheap and substandard. The movement of the seconds hand is not crisp and defined and may be the result of a poorly made mechanism.The watch band is not to my taste and I would replace it if I were to keep wearing the watch but at this time I am considering returning it to Amazon since the poor indexing bothers me quite a bit. I don't sit there and observe the seconds hand but the fact that I know that it does not index correctly makes me feel that I am wearing a very poorly made watch.I am not recommending this product to people that are critical of quality and refinement in manufacturing.
5,I strongly suggest this watch!,"I carefully reviewed watches on amazon for two weeks before I made my purchase. I wanted a watch that was extremely accurate, low maintenance, and able to take a beating. I do stagehand work so this watch will occasionally get bumped against steel. I have yet to see a scratch or blemish on the watch face after three weeks. The piece is also extremely accurate. Some reviewers have noted a smell coming from the watch band. It must be a personal issue because I haven't noticed anything after three weeks and I take part in physical labor. I have already suggested this watch to many of my fellow workers. I strongly suggest this time piece!"
1,Fire Hazard! These are the worst - Don't buy this item!,"I bought Gril-O-Sheets to grill summer squash and zucchini on my grill. The Gril-O-Sheets melted, caused 3 foot high flames, and the smell of it burning was really toxic. I was glad I had already cooked my steaks and hot dogs before I put the sheet on the grill or the steaks and dogs would have been ruined. I don't know if I can salvage my grill; the gril-o-sheet melted down into my grill and has caused a big mess. My husband will have to spend a couple of hours cleaning and hopefully nothing was damaged beyond repair. The packaging says it is Proudly Made in the USA. I hope this isn't an example of the type of workmanship we are now producing in our country. I only gave this one star because Amazon makes you give it a ""star"" rating. If I could have given it no stars, I would have."
3,So-So,"This album was so-so. Although I really like Eminem (and gave his other works five stars), this one is not nearly at the same level -- not nearly as creative, nor recorded as well, nor cohesive as the others. I will keep it for the couple small gems on it, but otherwise I was disappointed."
1,kj52's better,"guys the real thing you gots to listen to is the posotive stuff. i am recomending kj52 for you to be listenen to. i write rhymes myself, and i know how hard it is to be posotive"
3,Definitely not what I expected,"OK, when I first saw the songlist for this soundtrack, I was blown away. Nas, Gangstarr, Xzibit, Rakim. All great artists, with a little bit of Shady Records filler crap (Obie Trice, 50 Cent, D12) in between. Since the majority of the kids will buy this soundtrack solely for the lead-off single ""Lose Yourself"", which is a fine song, it doesn't really matter what I say about the rest of the album. But for those who know a good line-up when they see it, I'll tell you now: ... The first and last songs, by Eminem, are the only really good ones on here, and the rest are just weak! I at least expected Gangstarr to come through, but that song just cements my theory that DJ Premier has fallen off. There's not much more to say about the 8 Mile soundtrack, except that a single song is NOT worth the [money i spent on it]. Download this off the net, if possible, or just burn it. You've been warned."
3,remember it's a soundtrack,"When buying this CD, you need to remember you are purchasing a soundtrack. It isn't an Eminem album (unfortunatly). The Jay-Z song is catchy and 50 cent is real good too. The rest of the songs leave something to be desired."
3,Definately Overrated!,"One of the most overrated albums I've listened to for 2002. Not that it was totally terrible. Basically, every song by Eminem was garbage...and that even includes that highly overplayed song ""Lose Yourself."" Don't get me wrong, Eminem is a decent rapper, but when it comes to serious rapping, I can't take him serious. He ought to stick his more comical approach in his rhymes. Those are at least amusing. While his songs were ""..."" in my opinion, other artists shined on this soundtrack. I highly enjoyed songs by 50 Cent, Obie Trice, X to the Z, Gangstarr, and of course the legendary Rakim.I lost a whole lot of respect for Eminem as a rapper as a result of his contributing to this soundtrack. Also, what's the deal with putting Macy Grey on it??? Definately don't get it for just Eminem...his songs are weak."
2,Only buy the large print!,"The print was so small that I actually had to use a magnifing glass to read it. After one page, I decided to send it back. When I say the print is small, I mean the print is really....really small."
2,Good inspiration when you can read it.,"I was a bit disappointed when I received the book because there were many pages where the printing was illegible, faded or just missing. The pages that I could read completely I enjoyed. I could have sent it back but it was too much trouble for an old man."
3,NOT a practice DVD,"This DVD is clearly taught by a knowledgeable instructor and the lessons are valuable, but it is NOT a practice DVD. Lessons are quickly shown, often on only one side of the body (e.g., both the left and right sides are not necessarily shown). The lessons are usually demonstrated at full speed only a few times, so it is difficult to learn unless you use slow-mo and watch the segment repeatedly. This would be a good DVD if you want some quick examples, which you can then attempt to use on your own with the DVD paused or turned off altogether."
5,Fundamental but not Superficial,"I have practiced Taekwondo and Tai Chi and got this video primarily out of curiosity and because I have come to appreciate the quality of instructional videos produced by Dr. Yang. I was surprised at the number and level of techniques demonstrated. This may be a `fundamental' video but it is definitely not superficial.Dr. Yang interacts with the students demonstrating the techniques and corrects them on the spot which I found informative and helpful; as much as or more so than the introductions to the various stances and techniques themselves. The students also appear to be diverse in their skill levels, making the instruction more realistic and applicable to the average viewer.I often found myself pondering how some of what was being presented would also apply to the forms of martial arts I have practiced. Although I do not plan to take up a serious study of Kung Fu, I found this video to be worthwhile and applicable across multiple styles."
5,Excellent Movie from the 70's,"Los hijos de Sanchez is a real good story that Anthony Quinn, Lupita Ferrer and Dolores del Rio have made. The soundtrack od this movie is excellent as well Chuck Mangione, I recommend to anyone to buy it."
4,Great workout for the beginner and the experienced,"Challenging! Lots of tips for how to progress in the workouts, and the ""real"" people performing the routines make you feel like you can do it too."
3,not what i thought it'd be,this video was kind of boring to be honest. i bought it about 4 months ago and played it once.
2,Loreydean,"The video is good to learn what exercises are good and work multiple areas of the body. It is not anything I would ever use except for information. It has the worst music I have ever heard. I don't even know why they bothered with the music because it absolutely does not work with the exercise. It is not a video I would ever work out too. I think the producers are just capitalizing on the show. Big, big disappointment.I own 59 exercise videos. I don't care how good Michaels is with The Biggest Loser, I will never buy a product from The Biggest Loser again. I bought two other of her DVDs. They are not good for working out with either. Again, good info if you want to put together your own routine. But absolutely not a DVD you could work out to."
4,okay for once in awhile,I was excited about this one but then I was a bit disappointed after I did it. Its just her with one of the biggest loser people. Its broken up in segments. She calls it circuit training. There is no real warm up and NO cool down at all. The work-out just abruptly stops. I had to make up something to get my heart rate back down.The segments are good and I felt them the next day. I will put this DVD into my workout rotation. The weight excercises I liked for she states they will get rid of any arm flab. You require weights and a chair.
2,A poor man's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"This really is just a knock off of Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. It has all the elements, just done in a story that is very uninteresting...The art is okay, nothing special.The story itself is not super subtle. Wealthy Industrialists are bad and only have their own interests at heart (yeah seriously, I never would have guessed that), American icon and his ignored by the world sidekicks are good (we all love underdogs!). BLAH!Overall skip this one."
4,"Great story, fun puns, Fast read.",It was a really interesting story. My only dislike is that the novel was too short. I would have loved to see the story continue.
4,folk art,AN INTERESTING READ CENTERED AROUND TALES FROM THE APPLACIAN MOUNTAINS. WAS OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO ME AS IT WAS WRITEN BY A FORMER COLLEGE PROFESSOR OF MINE. AS YOU READ YOU ALMOST FEEL AS IF THE MOUNTAIN STORY TELLERS ARE SITTING BY YOUR SIDE. VERY AUTHENTIC.
1,Falling apart within 3 days,"I was very disappointed with this product. The little materials inside the wrap were falling out within three days! My wife put it in the microwave for only the third or fourth time, and when she attempted to pull it out, the little materials started dumping out into the microwave. Not put together very well if it is falling apart after only three days!"
1,Ripped opened up after 1.5 minutes in microwave,Liked in the beginning. I was very careful to only put in microwave for one and half minutes. The fifth time I did it it just opened pouring small yellow beads everywhere. Not worth the money at all.
4,neck warmer,Just as advertised. I bought this for my office when I have neck or back pain and it works great. A minute or 2 in the microwave and it last for 30 minutes
2,Not so hot,"We overdid the heating up, but even then, the wrap lost heat rapidly, and I didn't get much relief and no relaxation."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I just bought this machine, used it tonight, and it did not work! I am wondering if anyone else who reviewed this had white carpet, white carpet...stupid right?...anyway, it just didn't clean the carpet. When doing just one room I had to fill the soap twice, and empty the water twice. Just not worth it, even though it is the cheapest carpet cleaner out there, NOT WORTH IT!"
5,Great,I have used this vaccum once and it picked up things we didn't even see on the carpet. It was easy to clean out. We did take it outside though so as not to get dust in the house.
3,Haydn needs a conductor,"The symphonies of Haydn need a conductor, in my opinion. This CD features two of Haydn better known works, Symphonies Nos.53 and 73. Sym. No. 53 is a beautiful work that reaches its peak in its amazing finale. No. 73 is one of Haydn's masterworks and quite famous for its outrageous finale. No. 79 sounds like Haydn is spoofing himself. There are so many musical jokes in this work, it will keep you wondering what is really going on here. The playing of Orpheus on this CD is extremely close to total perfection. These works could not be played any better. However, the performances lack passion, the type of passion a conductor could bring to the music. This CD is currently unavailable and the cheapest version available from private sources is $28.00. I cannot think of any CD worth that much money, especially since CDs are routinely reissued. Save your money and buy a different recording, one that has a conductor."
4,breathing the fresh air...,"It is sensible to figure that even whilst engaged in the practice, we are still humans nonetheless, thus not exempt from having and affecting ill-intent towards others. Whether we mean to or not.Likewise, we can certainly have ill-intent towards ourselves; which complicates matters whilst traveling the Path.This book helped me to realize the nature of my own problems in this area and address them.Attacks indicate challenges to be resolved. An external attack often mirrors an internal attack (self against self). Oneself summons the external, tangible, adversary, and often we ask, surprised, ""Why am I being picked on!?"".Whether flesh/blood or not, the problem must be dealt with, or it continues keep us locked in a victim/aggressor-mentality loop. Trying an ""Ignore it and it'll go away"" doesn't work.Mr. Miller's book helped me stand up to what was essentially an enormously grotesque shadow cast by a tiny, mischievous, double-headed imp."
5,Great for beginners,This camera is the perfect camera for dummies/beginners. The touch-screen is very self-explanatory and easy to use.You don't need any manual or instruction reading to start using the camera. I love it! And the photo quality is excellent!!
5,camera works!,I highly recomend this camera to everyone! I am really excited to have it and all the positive reviews i've read have been all true for the most part. Although I haven't had a chance to use it with spectacular sceneries I already practiced using the drawing feature and it's great. zoom works well as does the touch screen. Sony must really take pride in their product.
5,Awsome camera,"This Sony N2 10.1 mega pixels replaces my old Sony 3.2 mega pixels Cyber-Shot. I love this camera. The pictures are nice and clear even I used 5 mega pixels. Actually, 5 mega pixels is enough for me. The touch panel is easy to use. 3"" screen is very big to veiw your pictures and videos. All my colleagues and friends love this camera too. Reasonable price and easy to use. The only thing that I don't like is the picture is too bright when I select auto flash light. Otherwise, this is a perfect camera."
1,Save yoour $$$$$,"Can't compare to the original movie in which you could see the action. This mess was shot mostly in the dark so you can't see anything much. All you get is a soundtrack with everyone yelling at one another. My guess is that it takes less talent and money to make a dark movie.I exchanged my first DVD for a replacement, which was just as bad as the first one.....so I guess I didn't get a defective disk, the movie is just too dark to see. I guess the producer wanted to leave the action to your imagination????"
3,Mixed bag,"The transfers seemed fine. The mixed bag is really with the content - AVP was decent (about on level with Alien 4 in my mind (better than Alien 3 but not as good as the first two)). However, AVPR was a terrible movie - I would much rather watch any of the 7 other Alien or Predator movies."
3,Close enough,"As a huge fan of the Alien franchise I wanted these movies in my collection. As far as the films go, if you dont expect too much they are a fun and action filled romp with some iconic monsters from the 1980's. If you are expecting a level of depth and direction as from some other titles in the franchise you will be very sad indeed.The biggest gripe is one that I was expecting after reading similar reviews about Requiem. It is way too dark, I think they were trying to hide some lackluster special effcts and while effective it really becomes annoying if you are trying to see any kind of detail or gore from the fight scenes."
1,A travesty,"This was a poor film. There was virtually no plot - what there was did not improve on the average 1950s horror B film, in which a load of small town idiots run around screaming and being picked off by the B.E.M.s, even uses the common 1950s ending in the monsters being nuked. I thought the original AvP was well done - but this is rubbish. No plot, poor acting and even the CGI was unoriginal and feeble."
1,Still to dark,"Had hoped being on Blu-ray, picture would be much better;however,films so dark doesn'r really matter."
2,Bad aspect ratio,"Take 3,000.00 full hd tv a 400.00 blue ray player, and only get a narrow wide screen. Would never buy this aspect ratio."
4,Scavenger whith Rollbar Mini-con,"O.k.I,m looking for sideways(who seems realy cool)when I see this guy.I think WOW!The colors could be a little Better but What the heck?He is a great transformer and his mini-con is great too.He is alittle hard to transform at first but gets easy after a while.The only thing I was dissapointed in was his powerlink.He litterally fires it from the hip.His Mini-con is O.K too.He is little more complicated than others.While Scavenger is in vehichle mode rollbar can sit inside.In robot mode Scavenger has stomping action(which limits the poseibility). All in all he is a great toy"
1,A Noisy Trasmitter,Dont buy this. This is useful as a charger but as a transmitter. I am pretty surprised Maxell has released such a bad product. There's too much of noise in the signal!
2,"What do you mean, 'bad image'?","This product works pretty well except for the fact that any photo I try to upload, it complains that it's 'bad'. After scorging the net, I found that if I bring it in to Photoshop and Save for Web, then it all works fine....but what if I didn't have Photoshop? That single issue is enough for me to only give this 2 stars. After all, for those non-graphically inclined, it would render the product useless.Also, the language options, leave much to be desired (what's with no East Asian character support?)"
2,"Great size, but weak distance.","The size can't be better, but if you are planning to be apart by any distance with trees and even small hills the connection will be spotty at best. We had trouble within 1/2 mile which made it useless for mountain bike on different trails."
1,you can watch this on hulu for free,"It doesn't cost a thing to watch this same movie on hulu. So if you love watching movies on Amazon and paying, watch it here. And if not, check it out on hulu and save your money for laundry."
2,You DO get what you pay for!,"I had high expectations for this steam cleaner based on all the reviews I read. While I think it would do a great job for someone who lives alone with no animals, I (with two kids, and a dog)thought it left something to be desired. Even though I SWEPT MY FLOOR THOROUGHLY PRIOR TO USING, the steam basically left wet globs of dust/dirt/hair wherever it was when I stopped pushing it and started pulling back. (Picture vacuuming motion.) To avoid this I could only PULL which meant lifting it on every pass. Needless to say that got a little old. As long as your floors are basically clean already, this will work great. Anyone else might want to consider something that has a vacuum as well."
3,Has several drawbacks,"I have owned this mop for a year or more and used it only about 6 times. My house is totally tiled in a shiny marble-like tile. When I use the Bissell Steam Mop the floors look clean, shiny and streak free. The main drawback is the difficulty in putting on the mop pads. They shrink in cold water and air drying so it takes forever to get one on and sometimes it slips off. I have been so disgusted that I mostly use a sponge mop unless I'm expecting company. Another drawback is that you have to keep pressing on the trigger to create the steam and once the mop pad is sufficiently wet, the water collects in the grout lines which the mop pad does not remove. Ovbiously one can change the mop pad but that is a time consuming challenge. Before purchasing this item I owned an Enviro Steamer which delivered continuous steam, was a lot easier to push around, and the pad is much easier to apply. Unfortunately, the Enviro didn't last too long. I wish Bissell would sell preshrunk mop pads."
3,NEEDS AN ON-OFF SWITCH FOR STEAM SPRAYER,"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE MY HOOVER FLOORMATE IS TOO AWKWARD TO USE IN SMALL SPACES LIKE TWO OF MY BATHROOMS. I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY. MY MAJOR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE TRIGGER CONSTANTLY TO GET STEAM, AND MY HAND GOT TIRED. IT NEEDS A SWITCH THAT WILL TURN THE STEAM ON AND KEEP IT ON UNTIL YOU TURN IT OFF. I WASN'T ALL THAT IMPRESSED WITH THE RESULTS EITHER. THE ONLY ADVANTAGE IS ITS SIZE - SMALL ENOUGH TO GET INTO TIGHT SPACES. I LIKE THE HOOVER FLOORMATE MUCH BETTER - WORKS GREAT IN MY KITCHEN AND LARGER BATHROOM."
4,Pretty Good Product,"Got my steam mop today. All in all I found it to be a good product. It worked extremely well in the kitchen on the vinyl floors. Next was the foyer with ceramic tile. It worked extremly well there as well. The bathrooms went very well on textured tile. Not as well as the kitchen but viable.I will say that you need to sweep really well. The mop cloth doesn't really pick up. It actually ended up pushing all the fine dust against the edges. It didn't take much to clean it up with a paper towel, just wish I didn't have to.The swivel head is great. Get's into all kinds of places. Again fantastic in the kitchen and foyer but it couldn't maneuver in the tight places behind the toilet.Overall great product. I think it beats the mop and bucket. I kind of miss the pinesol smell that gives me a sense of accomplishment. I guess clean floors will have to do."
2,I read the book first,"I have no quarrel with the acting or filming which is very good.The major problem here is with content.1) The Neanderthal weren't cross fertile with modern humans ( cro-magnon men).2) In fact from bones found in Neanderthal camp fires, they ate humans.3) The sling, like the bow and arrow, were later in the stone age;spear throwers were the height of technology closer to this era.I think that a more authentic representation of Neanderthalsmight be in order. Apparently if not at war with them from 40000 bcto 28000 bc, humans at least did not associate well with Neanderthals."
3,Better than I expected,"I read the book a long time ago and for some reason got wind of the movie's existance. Now, many years later, I found it on Amazon and bought it. Didn't really expect a LOTR class movie, but I think it was better than I expected."
2,What a disappointment!!,"Having read all of Jean Auel's books on pre-historic earth a minimum of 3 times each, I was extremely disappointed in the ""movie rendition"" of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"". Seems as though the only things kept from the actual book was the book title and names of the characters. A real disappointment. Ms. Auel's book deserved better. Someone should take the whole series of books and make a TV mini series from them and keep it true to the books."
4,It wasn't a bad movie,I didn't think this movie was bad. How much can you do with people who don't speak. It tried to stay as close to the book as it could. Of course it wasn't as good as the book but what movie is. But it is a good movie the first time you watch it. I wish someone would make a movie about the rest of the books in this series.
3,Too short,It was a good try. They needed to make it longer to get more of the books details. Not a bad try. I wasn't disapointed but may have been confused if I hadent read the book first.
5,A Great Movie,"I have read all of the books based on Ayla and loved them all, have read them many many times. There is no possible way that you could take the book and make it into a movie without leaving out a lot of details. I feel they did a wonderful job with the movie and I have watched it many times. To be more true and accurate to the book you would have to make a Mini-series and I for one would love to see that!!! It would make for a much more interesting night of television than most of the junk that they have on now. Daryl Hannah was an excellent Ayla but the entire cast had their work cut out for them but I was also very impressed with James Remar as Creb, wow did he bring Creb to life. For those that nit picked this movie apart then I suggest that you don't watch it again, for myself I will watch it again and again. Would really like to see a sequel!!"
3,Eeeehh.,"I loved Daryl Hannah and James Remar in the movie. They did a great job. But, I really wish the movie stuck closer to the book. So many things were just so off that if you didn't read the book it may just seem way too corny. Read the book, it's really great!"
1,"horrible, horrible movie","I really enjoyed reading the books, but this is a wretched movie. Even Darryl Hannah (who did an admirable job) could not save it. The soundtrack is really terrible. The acting was spotty. The makeup was absurb. The special effects were amateurish. The camera work was sloppy. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was impossible. Did I mention, this is not a good move? Not even worth renting, IMHO."
4,The Clan of the Cave Bear,Daryl Hannah was great as Ayla. I was keeping my fingers crossed that the rest of Jean Auel's of Earth's Children books would be made to movies.
5,Good experience,"I often have trouble doing a review - sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I am pleased with my experience with this seller. The item was just as described, shipped in a very reasonable time frame and the price was reasonable."
1,Did not care for it,"I did not think the movie did justice to the book. The movie omited and changed very important things like the birth of Durc and how she was sentenced to the final death curse. Those things were the basis for feelings in the following books. If they wanted to move to the next book, it could only be worse, because of the lack of attention given to vital parts of the movie. Granted, they cannot include every detail, and naming each plant would have taken up too much time, but I think it could have been done with a little more care for the story line. If I hadn't already read the book, I would not have been interested in reading it after the movie."
1,Very poor,All I can say is read the book! I got the movie after the book. Big mistake. This is less then a poor effort.
3,Hell's review,It's not too bad. My Grandma loved the books so I brought the DVD for her 79th Birthday!
2,Poor excuse,"I would say this movie made an honest effort on trying to make a movie adaption of this classic book. However, it falls far short of doing the book any justice. About half of the book is cut out of this screenplay and it loses almost all of the atmosphere that the book created. All that is left is a hour and half movie that tries to make up for a lack of script and life."
2,why did they stray so far from the book storyline?,"If you don't read the book this may have been a decent movie when it was made in the 80s. It was not what I wanted since the book was one of the best I've read. I can't imagine why they would change it so much because it would have been better if they followed the storyline.Maybe there was just not enough time to really capture the essence of the book. I certainly do not agree with the changes they made and the only redeeming factor was Daryl, who was far too old for the 12 year old girl in the story."
3,Clan of the Cave Bear,"Though not an exact retelling of the book, pretty close. The main subject points came to the forefront and with the right writing team, the story could continue. DH did pretty good for not talking much; she was much better in Splash as the mermaid eating lobster :-) Her facial expressions really told her story as she tried to become a member of the clan, fit in, and become a contributing member, even if it did not fit the traditional mold of the female of the clan."
4,it is a nice fixed size product,"It is good, but it is missing the small piece that allows me to uncover it and flip it. I had to take it from the old broken one and stick it using glue on the new one"
3,"This albumn is full of value,","This album contains some of America's most cherished pieces of music. The melodies will captivate the imagination and will no doubt conjure up images a burgeoning America. Rhapsody in Blue will transport you to the bustling city, while Adagio for Strings and Appalachian Spring will bring you to the wilderness. These pieces are a must have, and a compilation album offers an outstanding value."
3,optimus prime!!!!!!!!!,so i got this guy a while ago and hes ok i would prefer the optimus prime with the trailor (getting) cristmis 2003/2004 but he can pull the better optimus primes trailor overall id say get it if you dont want to spend like $50us $70ca hes a good transformer
5,Buzz v. Bathtub,"I bought Buzz for my son's 3rd Christmas and it lasted for almost 4 years. Had he not taking Buzz swimming in the bathtub, he would have worked a little better. After coming out of the tub, Buzz sounded like a wounded cat :) Luckily, after he dried out and the contacts for the batteries and other circuits were cleaned, he came back to life in full swing. Talk about being durable. Unfortunately, over time, his limbs started coming off (with more than ample help from my son, mind you), but fortunately that was right about the time TS2 came out and Woody was missing a limb. Since my Son didn't have a Sheriff Woody doll, he kind of compensated by using Buzz in a dual role. (Much like TS1...Mrs. Nesbitt).Cheers."
3,"Great singing, who's idea was it to put everything in FRENCH?",I've had this CD for a long time. I love the singing even if it's a bit dated now. What I will NEVER understand is why a German record company would release in the U.S.A. a recording of RUSSIAN music with ONLY FRENCH titles!
4,Staying Dry,"The Frogg Toggs work well. I'm dry as can be during rainy camping outings. The only issue I have is no jacket pockets. Often I just wear the jacket and it is a nuisance not to have pockets to put my hands in or items in. Same with the pants, although there are pass through pockets when I wear pockeless shorts during warm , rainy weather no pockets! Otherwise a terrific product at a fair price."
2,OK but!,"Just received a set of the camo pro action mossy oak breakup XXL yesterday. They look OK. (I like the camo pattern)I normally wear XL size, I can tell you that the XXL Jacket is not what I would consider a generous cut (like some of the others may have implied). The stuff sack that comes with it is totally useless since it is far to small to accomodate the XXL jacket and pants (it might be OK for a small or even a medium) the zipper appears to be plastic (at least it won't rust) and the snaps do pull apart very easily in the vertical plane. They seem to be a bit more sturdy in the horizontal plane.I think if you are looking for something for very occasional use in light winds they will probalbly be OK."
4,Frogg Toggs,"Service was excellent. Item arrived as described. It is not a heavy duty item, but it did not come with a heavy duty price tag. Purchased for walking the dogs during summer down pours. Heavy brush should be avoided. I had seen this frequently advertised and decided to give it a try. Living on the edge!"
3,No Pockets,Neither the coat nor pants have pockets. Also the coat could be a little longer to provide coverage during stretching.
2,Jacket way too short!,"The jacket is too short. Needs to be longer, even a parka style with cinching waist would help, just to provide extra coverage. An XL on a 5'8"" male and can't sit down with out the jacket lifting in the back leaving an area to get wet. Can't lift arms over head for any normal activity with out jacket raising up as well. Cinching doesn't help either. No pockets in jacket or pants, which stinks but is probably for waterproofing purposes. The jacket on the zipper also seems to leak pretty bad, left a wet spot all the way down the front of my shirt. The compactness and weight are great."
1,Power Head Connector Defective,"We bought this unit from Costco and thought it would be a good unit. However, within 12 months, the connection between the powerhead and the shaft/handle had fractured due to poor design of the retainer. Now the head will not stay on the shaft. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. You will regret it."
1,Long term update - not good and will be costly $$$,"Long term update on this product as I have had it for under 3 years now. the product stopped working, no power and lights flashing. Took it into the repair and they stated the switch had shorted out the circuit board, a common problem when the unit heats up which this product does. They want $145.00 to repair so it's out to shop for another brand and it will not be a Bissell product ever again.I agree with the many reviews here that his product is of a very poor design and not efficient for what you pay for it. I would not recommend this product at all. I will now see how good Bissell customer support is to see what they will offer to repair or replace this poor product."
1,What a crock!,I bought this digipro in January 2005. Used it about 4 months and the hose disconnected from the cannister. Apparently the only thing holding the hose onto the cannister are the small electric wires that make the floor attachment run and wrapped around the hose is black electrical tape. For $250 you would think a company as well known as Bissell would have more pride in the workmanship that goes into thier cleaners. I will never buy another Bissell product because they are shoddy!
2,Hoover 12 amp is better.,This is not a bad mcahine but does not have enough suciton power. I initially opted for this one becuase it has a powered brush but the suction let me down. HEPA filter is nice but I would prefer more suction and use a HEPA BAG.Not a RECO.
5,Great Fit!!!!!,"I recently purchased a 55 gallon tank 48x13x20 and bought a Versa glass top that was supposed to fit, well it was to short and the plastic extension you slip on was at a horrible angle as you will see with other bad reviews of the Versa. I read the positive reviews on the Perfecto glass and decided to try another glass top and im glad i did it fit perfect and was easy to install and also to cut the plastic extension for my filter."
4,becca's (really it's 4.5 stars)review,"This book was very suspensful.Peter is a teenager with ADD who's stepfather doesn't like him. Buck,his stepfather, thinks that he hates his half brother whom Peter really loves. I reccomend this book to any teenager who wants a good book that they can relate to. Peter is trapped like many teenagers. Though most teenagers are metaphorically trapped the author gives his readers a good real life, though somewhat more drastic then most of us will face, look at the every day life of a struggling teen waiting to discover who he really is. Peter, in the end, finds out who he is and who his friends and family really are with the help of a disillousioned poet, a girl with an eating disorder, and a overly friendly gaurd who is trying to right his wrongs. I am sure that if you pick up this book that the suspense will keep it in your hands until you've found every juicy detail(just like in the tabloids)."
5,so glad you had it!,"i was missing just this one sham, and had heard amazon sold dkny bedding from domino magazine! Hurray i found it!"
3,Falls short of being great.,"I'm surprised that all of the other reviewers neglected to mention the shortcomings of this set. Without Siegfried's Funeral March from Die Gotterdammerung and coupled with the fact that the liner notes stink, this is well deserving of 2 stars, but I was generous. Get the EMI set ""Orchestral Music"" with Szell conducting which has everything that this collection has plus Siegfried's Funeral March, good liner notes and extra selections."
1,This book is not helpful.,"This has many made up names I assume were included to make the 50001 goal.Reading this book is kinda like walking down the street and saying everything you see as a possible name for your child. How about naming your son tree?, or gate? or door? or hubcap? Her meanings also seem made up. Accordinging to the author Orange supposedly means ""sparkly"", she says Flicky means ""vivacious"" and Parslee supposedly means ""complementary"".The number of made up names actually cheapens the usefullness of the good names as you have to read so many duds (and I'm talking dozens at a time) to get to anything that you haven't heard of before and doesn't sound made up.I'm sure some people actually name their kids stupid things, but do we need a book to help us find names like Ikea or Fructose?It makes you feel like the author is making fun of you when you read it. Jokes on me I guess."
1,too many made up names,"I was so disappointed in this book. Most of the names seemed made up. I just did not find this book helpful in anyway. If you are looking for something totally out there this book is for you. But if you want a normal interesting and unique name, look somewhere else."
3,Sheet Music - Piano/Vocal/Guitar,"A book of sheet music for 13 of their songs. As far sheet music goes, it could be better. It's your run of the mill take-a-song-and-condense-it-down-to-3-parts (Piano/Vocal/Guitar). The only guitar part is a single chord line - no tablature or lead parts. The same holds true for their 'Stunt' sheet music book. Songs: Be My Yoko Ono - Box Set - Brian Wilson - Enid - If I Had A $1,000,000 - What A Good Boy - Alternative Girlfriend - Jane - Life In A Nutshell - The Old Apartment - Shoe Box - Straw Hat And Dirty Old hank - This Is Where It Ends."
2,Ermmmm...,"Defiently not one of the better book I've read. The writing was flat, there was no details or much of any emotion I could relate too. The charcaters, besides Eleanor and Lydia were flat and boring.Honestly, this book was alright but If you want better YA fiction try some of Neal Shusterman, Sarah Dessen or Chris Woodings books."
5,Totally reflects the spirit of the book.,"The movie totally reflects the spirit of the book. i enjoyed reading it when I was a kid, and I can say that the movie has absolutely met my expectations."
5,Great movie! Can't believe it flop.,"This movie is a great movie, under rated. I can't believe it flop. Inaccurate reviews in my opinion. Did not get bored from beginning to end. Who ever rated this movie 3 stars below are too much cry babies. I think Disney just did a poor job on promoting this movie. Hottest princes i've seen in a decade."
3,John Carter,Not a great movie but good. Visual effects are good and it has an interesting twist on Edgar Rice Burroughs.
4,John Carter,It's 4 stars (sort of) but not because of the acting (3 1/2 stars) or the story (2 1/2 stars). I loved watching it on the screen and the action was great. It was the larger than life scenes and the animation that made it. The rest? Eh...
1,Terrible,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Sooooo bad! The acting is awful, the premis is rediculus and the special effects are really poorly done. I have no idea why people are giving it five stars. It sounds like they really liked the books that it was based on. Well, having not read the books I can say that from a purely cinematic perspective John Carter is a total flop."
1,My only first and only 1 star review.,"Regretfully, I listened to these reviews and bought this movie. I disagree with these reviews. I thought the movie looked cheap and the quality was terrible for 3D and for Disney. Amateurish and childish. The story was boring, confusing, and I could have cared less. I watched The Avengers in 3D a few hours later and wow. That is what 3D is supposed to look like. I know a lot of people here like it and that is fine. For me, personally, it was a waste of time. Just my two cents."
2,Don't read the story first if you want to enjoy this movie!,"I made the mistake of reading the Princess of Mars first, which is a fantastic short story for the time period it was written. If I hadn't read the story first, I may have enjoyed the movie a lot more. The movie is action packed, but that was not enough to make up for the poor interpretation of the book. I saw the movie at the $2 theater and still felt I overpaid. If you want to gain some enjoyment from the movie, don't read the book first or you will be sorely disappointed."
2,"a ""B"" movie.","John Carter is a ""B"" movie with a big budget (bad acting and chesssyyy dialogues. I'm not surprised it did so bad in theaters. Disney, in fact, did fire the exec due to its failure...."
2,Nice special effects,"I will have to read the book because there wasn't enough information provided about the characters' histories(poor character development). I normally like a good underdog story or good vs evil, but the script writers must have assumed that all the movie goers had read the book and memorized all of the import details that were left out of the movie. At one point in the movie female lead says ""I know you John Carter"" and describes his character with a level of detail that was completely absent from the script. There is NO way she could have known him from what I saw on the screen.I am not a fan of this movie!"
2,Sub Standard HD,"I rented this - High Definition - movie assuming that high definition was what I would get. Unfortunately the definition of high definition that Amazon uses and the one I use are two very different things. The one they use seems to be 720p as opposed to the 1080i the rest of the world uses. Although I certainly enjoyed the movie (squinting aside), it will be the last time I rent an HD movie from Amazon. Just glad I didn't buy it. What a disappointment that would have been. If you have access to Comcast HD movies on demand you might want to use it. Even though it is a dollor or so more expensive, you get what you pay for..."
5,This movie was great.,"I don't care how much the critics rip into this movie, I thought it was great. I've read the first three books within the series and I felt the writers of the film improved upon the original story."
3,Entertaining; not that bad!,"This movie is not bad, certainly nowhere near as bad as the box office fizzle might lead one to think. Sure, the main actor has poor delivery and not much appeal, but the story is interesting and entertaining, the effects are pretty good and even great at times, and what more could you want of a Disney take on a sci fi story?"
3,"""A heroic tale that will inspire beyond imagination.""",Are they talking about my trip to the potty this morning? Great description there! We may also say the movie is a heroic tale that will fail without description.
2,Not very good,Ok but not great. That's why I skipped it in the movies. The story was weak and the acting was too.
2,"Big disappointment, understand why it bombed at the box office","John CarterAlmost regretted the time, cost, and effort spent to watch this box office bomb from Disney. Fancy and over-the-top CGI can not rescue poor script, dialogue, and license with the written story. While the acting was barely acceptible, it seemed most of the actors suspected that the script and lines were not good enough to draw out their best efforts. While the leading lady was pleasing eye-candy, I can understand why the movie bombed at the box office."
5,So Underrated,"I really do believe that bad marketing killed this movie. I saw it in the theaters and thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately, because of such bad press, the movie fell far short of its budget. I strongly encourage anyone who is a fan of science fiction to give this movie a go--you will not be disappointed. My hope is that the DVD/Blu-Ray sales are enough to prod someone to make a sequel--it's far worthier of one than many of the other franchises coming out of Hollywood."
2,New Worlds no longer new...,I have read most Edgar Rice Burroughs adventure series. John Carter on Mars was a great read but the film did not capture any of the excitement the book created. Times have changed and thoughts of other worlds are no longer new.
1,Soulless,masonic crap. Story was soulless and if they could have gotten anymore references to Isis that would be the entire movie.
2,Mainstream media products,No substance. I shut off the movie in the middle because the story was not interesting. Mainstream media cranks out products like this simply to make money. Even if it flopped at the box office (which I understand it did) they profit. Another good reason to read instead.
5,John Carter,"This movie was great. At first I didn't have high hopes for it, because there isn't a really well known cast in it, but the plot was great, there's a twist at the end, and the whole concept was plausible (you'll understand when you watch it - I thought the guy was a super hero, but that's not the case). Would buy this movie to own."
4,John Carter,My Grandson and I really enjoyed the movie (John Carter)..the creatures...and the story..andthe action..I would recoment this movie to everyone...Ordered from Amazon
1,It stunk,I didn't like this movie AT ALL! I watched maybe 30 minutes of it...fell asleep...then went back and watched another 10 minutes or so.It stunk!
1,Boooooooring!!!!!,"I have 3, 7, and 10 year old boys and none of them could watch this movie the entire way through. I was bored too so I can't blame them. This movie looked so awesome in the preview and my kids were excited to see it. It was a humungous let down!!!"
2,Conan + Star Wars = John Carter,"We really did nit dig this movie to much. The story just never got off the ground. I felt like I was watching a Star Wars spin off with Conan tossed it. The special effects were good, that was the only plus to this movie. Very long a drawn out. Rent it only, save your money."
3,Book & Movie Should be Different Entities,"The CGI, props and sets carry the movie. The script although based on the fantastic stories of ERB is what holds this movie back. By analogy would you buy a 30 year old computer and be entertained by it's functions? No. The book and it's predecessors were based on a subject that we didn't know much about at that time and for an audience that had knowledge of the subject area that a 10 year old would now laugh at. The dialogue especially seemed too dated and Hollywood dumb speak like. The rest of the script when compared to scifi, fantasy and other futuristic films that have come out these past two decades also seemed old and dated. A movie and it's inspirational book are two different mediums - it's OK to allow the movie to be scripted as a separate identity yet still pay homage to it's text inspiration. Know and write for the audience."
4,"movie, John Carter","The movie is dramatic and suspenseful enough, but is probably longer than I would think as being absolutely necessary. There are a couple of places where the movie could have ended, but it kept going. The story line also follows a kind of standard plot format that runs through a variety of these science-fiction films."
4,However,It was supposed to be new however the Blu Ray showed that it had been previously viewed. That being said the movie showed no ill effects & the picture was fantastic!
4,Bad hype-Good Movie,"I read a lot of bad press about this movie and I guess a lot of people gave up on it somewhere along the line. I guess the studio spent too much to make it. However, I found it to be a good movie that the whole movie can watch! Leans more toward a teenage/kid audience rather than an adult audience. Worth renting!"
1,Not very entertaining,"With all of the hype on this movie we were expecting more. It has good special effects, but just is not a good movie. Do not waste your money."
1,Sue Disney,"When I heard that John Carter of Mar was a flop, I thought how could this be? Here is a group of eleven books that a large group of fans read once, twice, three or more times. Then I saw the movie. The director/ writer tried to cover all the books in one movie. As I watched it, I would say this is not in the books. Then a part would stray back into the story and I would hope it would stay there. E. G. B. was a great writer and as one person stated, we will never see a second try at doing this movie. In trying to update the story line, the story line was destroyed. Disney just allowed a cash cow bigger than Pirates of the Caribbean to slip through their hands and in the process deprive the fans of John Carter the joy of seeing the images that formed in their minds while they read John Carter of Mars, which was the last, to be transformed to big screen."
4,Critics killed what was a good movie with possibilties,"This was a great movie, the ""Critics"" actually killed this movie and made a lot of people not go to see it. The Barsoom series were favorites of mine as a kid and I just re-read them prior to this movie coming out. Trying to seriously put a book (or series of books) into film is a very hard task, so the leeway taken with the original story has to be accepted. But the story itself was quite good and the effects were worth the huge amount of money they spent on them. What a shame that the reviews from the critics were so dismal. I have learned that if the critics say it was bad, I go see it first, because I am the average person looking for entertainment value, not the critic looking for some redeeming social value and underlying social commentary. Critics for the most part are MORONS....."
3,Pretty good movie. Great CGI. Story OK.,"I rented John Carter in 2D on BluRay and viewed it on a 50"" Plasma. The special effects are at least as good as anything I've viewed on my set. The green Martians and other creatures indeed look real.Although I had never read nor really known of the books, I realized beforehand that the story is a fantasy for adolescents. However, I was still a bit put off by the vague corniness of script and acting, and the loosely constructed fictional physics of the red planet.When my son is 8 years old or so, I imagine this will be just about his favorite movie ever."
2,John Carter review,"I was not crazy about this movie, although it had some good parts. And then it seemed at the end they weren't sure how to end the movie that to me the ending didn't make sense and if it did I was so tired and just wanted it to hurry up and be over. It was extremely long...Just glad I didn't go to the movies and see it."
5,Great Movie!,"I watched this movie in the theater. I was blown away-great casting, wonderful special effects, and an amazing love story. For 2 hours, I was transported and totally absorbed in the movie. For the life of me, can't understand why it did so poorly in the US. But, I understand it has really done well internationally. I'm buying this DVD because its one of those rare movies that I could watch over and over."
2,I HAD HIGH HOPES ON THIS ONE,THOUGHT THIS ONE WAS GOING TO BE A BLOCK BUSTER. BUT IT WASNT.MONSTERS IN THIS ONE LOOKED TO COMICAL.I LIKE THE LITTLE DOG OR WHAT EVER IT WAS. STORY COULDNT HOLD MY INTEREST.
5,John carter four disc set,This is the best movie I have seen in the last five years and now on my all time favorite list! For those who listened to the critics when this movie first came out you did yourselves a disservice. All those critics seemed to all have the same point words as though they Minh birdied the same review. Makes one wonder if they were too lazy to watch this movie and just followed one another! One same complaint was they didn't get it and it was too confusing. Well I watched it with my 11 year old granddaughter and she had no problem with it. Maybe when these news outlets hire critics they should have an iq of at least room temperature . I find it sad that people never gave it a chance at the theaters but hope they find out how wonderful of a film this is!!!!! A must have on DVD!
2,John Carter never even started to live up to the book.,"I know that it is difficult to make a movie of a book and please all the fans of the book. In the case of John Carter it appears that the movie was never introduced to the book! The film took what was one of my childhood favorites and made it into something I was sorry to have wasted money on. The only things that remained true to the books were some of the names. The entire paradigm for the movie changed, In the book the residents of Mars had faced the danger of extinction and had come forth victoriously into a state of victory in an advanced civilization. In the movie the residents were hanging on, barely!The movie did not do justice to the books or the characters in the books. Even if I would have never read any of the Edgar Rice Burroughs books, this attempt would have failed to entertain me. To me, that entertainment is the mark of a good film. John Carter missed the mark."
5,John Carter,"This movie was action packed and very enthralling , really liked the theme of the movie , about aliens would watch again."
4,good movie warth watching,Buy it instead whyto much to rent. My mistake. Most movies rent for 3.99 I should of looked first! slower conetions wont play this as good either. Pretty grainy
5,Naomi's room,"Book is well written, scary and sad. Author does a great job at making one feel what the protagonist is feeling, not an easy read because it overwhelms one with deep feelings"
2,Snobbish shop owners name brands,"I was very disappointed in this book. Mostly the mother-daughter team, who own a costume jewelry shop, tells you to buy expensive French brands you already knew about. The book is about half photographs of them wearing classic clothes that don't look particularly French---cream, khaki, navy and other neutrals. Very tasteful, and stylish in a quiet way, but nothing specifically French. Maybe that's the point. Entre Nous by Debra Ollivier was vastly more useful in understanding what makes french woemn seem more stylish. She is an American who lived in Paris for a decade married to a Frenchman."
3,Not a bad read,"This book was not how I expected it to be, however it was very interesting. It is a light read and it is good for anyone who likes to learn about culture"
2,subtle advertising,"Having just returned from Paris, I did find this book ""right on"" (simplicity, accessorizing etc.) in many ways, however , it lacked depth, and the costume jewelry was quite gaudy and not really that current. The subtle advertising for the author's store was a turn off."
5,I'm so Impressed!,"Wow ... I still balk at ordering online, but this was impressive. First off, the price can't be beat .. at least at my local stores. Their communication got an A+ from me. Then, when I got my order less than 3 days after ordering ... well, wow!And I do so love fresh vanilla beans and these are the best. Soft and bendable (= fresh), fragrant beyond compare - just lovely!"
5,Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla Beans,"These beans are most excellent!! You can smell them in the mailbox! Olive Nation is a superb seller. The product arrived quickly, and the price is good."
3,Not fit for all lenses,"This converter works great with my ""Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 USM"" making it a 36-110mm lens, but when I try the 2x converter with my ""Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM"" the lens isn't able to focus on anything. Instead, I recomend a ""Bower MC4 2X AF Teleconverter"" or ""Kenko Teleplus MC-7 2X AF Teleconverter"" type as they seem to work better with zoom lenses."
3,Basically a glorified sweeper,"Really this is just a glorified sweeper that doesn't work on carpet or rugs. It has one thin line of bristles behind the suction hole. On any carpet besides the really thin hotel lobby-type, this proves to be useless because it can't loosen particles down in there. On hard floors it works great to get things up.I would have liked a basic motorized roller in the head but it is only a $25 vacuum. It is quite light and has decent sucking power."
5,Bissell 3106A a great little vaccum,"I purchased this vaccum to do quick little clean-ups on my bathroom tile floors and my hardwood floors in the kitchen and hall. It is light weight and has adequate suction to do these jobs very well. The cord is probably 3 feet too short but I simply added a small extension cord to solve this. Still, the cord is 12 ft long so depending on the room it can be adequate for most users. I do have to empty the filter after each cleaning because of it's small size but I don't really see this as a problem. It's a great little vaccum."
3,Great for hardwood not good on thick carpet,"My house is mostly hardwood floors and i hate sweeping. This thing works great for that,but does not work great in the bedrooms where there is carpet...its hard to push and takes forever to get everything...i like that you can take it apart to have a handheld, but i find myself using my cordless handheld more because of the cord hassle with this one."
2,Where's the Suction?,"I guess I shouldn't have expected much for the price I paid. Thank goodness I didn't pay more. I've seen this vacuum advertised for almost $40. That said, I did expect it to pick up a little drywall dust that fell on our newly tiled bathroom floor when we installed the towel rod. It didn't do it. In the laundry room, I used it to clean up some cat litter, but even that wasn't so easy. There just isn't enough power to do an efficient job. The only value it has to me is that I don't have to drag out the Dyson all the time and it will convert to a handvac. If I had to do it all over again, I'd invest my money in something better."
4,Good deal worth this price,"I was a little afraid reading all the reviews and then also ordering for this product. But well, I finally got this product in 4 days (with Ground shipping / free shipping!) and I made a chance to use this product today itself...well, it is very handy, and basically cleans the floor / carpet area well. The only cons I'll say is that once you clean the floor using this vac, and then when u need to clean the inner filter, you need something like brush or some other stuff to clean it properly...it that too would have been included, it would have been the best deal!"
2,Bissell,"Item has good cleaning capability, however, it doesn't have enough power to clean thick carpet and you have to keep cleaning out filter."
3,not meant to last,"this vacuum lasted me about a year before it stopped sucking anything up. The size and weight was nice, but in general I would recommend a more durable machine, unless you are just sending it with a child to a college dorm."
1,Is mine defective?,"I bought this based on all the positive reviews, but the one I have doesn't pick up anything!! The few things it did pick up would only get sucked up after going over the item several times. I really just wanted something small to use daily for small jobs instead of getting out the big vac. This thing is going back. It's not even worth $20.00. A small hand-held vac is more powerful."
1,Different Product,"I ordered a vacuum, but instead I got a steam mop. Honestly, I do not need a steam mop, and I want my money back."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I appreciated the other reviews for this item. It was exactly as everyone else said it would be. Easy to assemble, great price, quick to use. It is perfect for our hard floors. It fills up fast but I just dump it out and reuse. I'll wash the filter after the next use. I don't think it is necessary to wash everytime."
2,Not a very good vacuum.,"This is a pretty worthless vacuum. Don't ever try vacuuming rugs or carpets with it, as it will just push the dirty around or get stuck on the bottom. It's one of the cheapest vacuums out there and it shows. I'm really bemused by the number of positive reviews this product has gotten. I have only read a few of them, but the owners must all have hardwood floors or something. It works okay on them, but any rug or carpet makes it worthless. I usually end up resorting to my trusty old red dirt devil, and getting down on my hands and knees and cleaning the carpet.Seriously, if you want a good cheap vacuum, this isn't it. Look elsewhere and ignore these other positive reviews."
2,Not much power,Unfortunately the feather weight vacuum is true to it's name. No suction power. The reviews all raved about this product but I did not have the same results.
4,Good Performance and a Time Saver,"I bought this vac as an alternative to getting out my heavier upright for small cleaning jobs. It's got very good power and is very easy to maneuver on steps. In fact, it works so good that I sometimes use it for regular carpet cleaning instead of our regular vacum! My younger children like to use it without even being asked to, and there's nothing wrong with that! One minor gripe: the vacum head will fall off during use if not shoved on with a strong hand. Other than that it's great!"
3,not powerful enough,"it is very light. Works fine in hard floor. But only can remove dusts. For a little bit larger pieces of papers, it can not remove very well. Not powerful at all."
3,Very light. Does the job. But the power isn't much to talk about,"As the subject would say, the thing is very light. Easy to carry around and do the chores. It's averagley noisy, doesn't create a panic while it's in operations.A minor drawback (OF COURSE) is that at such a low price, you do not get much sucking power out of it. It is recommended for light use only. I bought this because I did not require a vacuum cleaner for daily heavy use. This one just acts as a cleaner for visible small dirt and trash. I do not expect it to clean too deep."
1,I game mine away,it won't even stand up by itself against a wall...doesnt'do well on carpet at all. I gave mine away. $20 gone.

4,One of the Best Barbie's yet !!,"I have to admit, I truly enjoyed this one. I do like most of the Barbie's movies, but Mermaid 2 actually held my attention thru the whole movie and that is saying something for a 40yr old. And another hit song too!! My 5 yr old loved the song Queen of the Waves, but she is loving Do the Mermaid just as much."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"Not as good as I hoped it would be. In the first one it sounds pretty clear that you have to be born to spin merilia when Merliah says she's the only one in the royal family who cant and if this was a big ceremony for 1 royal only, to get the ability to make the merilia wouldn't all the other mer-people have known she couldn't until this ceremony?! There are other things that dont make much sense to me in it but my kids are 4 & 5 and dont seem to notice. They like it but I think the first one and Mermaidia were much better."
3,Better than most,"I have to admit when it comes to HALF human and HALF fish films I am not usualy not impressed at all, the concept itself for one thing sort of throws me off, and in general I like to appriciate the whole of our being as a creation, which includes legs.However, if you are into mermaids alot and are looking for a decent film, I think Barbie's a mermaid tale 2 could be recomended, there was no negative content that I can recall, and in the end like most barbie films this once encourages friendship, and to let your true self shine inspite of the peer preasure that you may face for doing it."
5,One of the best ones yet,"My kids LOVE this movie we have all the barbie movies one of their favorites was mermaid 1. So I thought it would be hard to live up to the first but this is excellent great story line, not sure who loves it more me or the kids."
1,Health by questionnaire.,"The fallacy of this book is its completely unscientific stance on ""metabolic"" types, a psuedoscientific idea whose time has long come and gone, except by certain diet extremists, to whom this represents being ""individualized."" Most of the sources the authors cite have been long discredited by reputable nutrition authorities, and virtually all of their information is anecdotal. There is no reliance on published studies, or for that manner, any studies undertaken by the authors themselves. Their questionaire method of metabolic type determination looks convincing, but no rational person would believe that this could substitute for appropriate testing, expecially if you are the ""high protein metabolic type"" and have problems with cholesterol. Read and believe at your own risk."
1,Difficult,"This is one of the worst books I have read on using your metablic type. It is bordering on clinical in my estimation, difficult to read and follow. The test is useless -- at least for me -- because I scored high (equally) on two and very low on one and there is no clear typing in this case (I guess I am just supposed to eat a balanced diet). I would have given it no stars if I could. A much better book and easy to follow is eat right for your type. I am glad I only checked this out from the library."
2,Fair to mild,"There were a lot of unclosed loops in the book. The author talks about Oxidization types and using specific tests in order to determine your type, (not included in the book) I had to buy two more books in order to get more information (from another author) and then got the information I needed of Youtube. If you author a book and you expect people to pay good money for it - please ensure your close all the loops!"
4,Metabolic Typing Diet,Interesting information. This should help with digestion and assimilation issues I've had for a long time. I look forward to completing it and testing myself.
3,Obsessing.....,There are some interesting passages and knowlesge to be gained from reading this book. I guess I was expecting more...
5,enigma 23,"I am always amazed at those who find existence mundane and droll. It is nice to know that there are those out there who believe otherwise, if you are looking for a trip through another dimension this is your book, keep an eye out for 23 after you close the cover."
5,A wonderful read and gift!,"This book was fun to read and so full of valuable ideas. It is not only full of practical suggestions, it is also very uplifting. This book will make a wonderful addition to every baby shower gift. Lauren in Pebble Beach"
4,the only book about child-rearing I haven't wanted to throw,"This book is a sigh of relief after a long day. It's not overwhelming, and it doesn't make you feel like you're doing everything wrong as a new mom. It reminds you that interacting with your new baby should be simple and fun, and gives you little ideas to bond with your child more each day. It also reminds you that you're not alone in your overwhelming new circumstances, and offers simple prayers to give you perspective. It's been great for me, and the other moms I know."
2,Mssing a lot of key material !!,"This version of the book is definitely missing key topics that are asked in the exam. For example, it does a very poor coverage of PPPoE in chapter 11. The RFC 1483 is never mentioned, which is a building block of PPP0oE and PPPoA architectures. Another example is QoS in chapter 15. Custom queuing (CQ) and priority queuing (PQ) are never mentioned which are favourite topics on the actual exam.My recommendation is to either use another resource, or ensure that you supplement it with online pdfs from cisco.com and practice tests."
2,OK book but not enought to pass...,Material is good but is missing stuff. Cisco should be ashamed with the ammount of typos. Check out the typos here: http://www.ciscopress.com/title/1587051486# Without the typos I would have given it a 3 maybe 4 stars. Needs to be updated.
5,Prevent pipe Freeze,Very reasonable price for this needed item. Temps down to 5 degrees Farenheit and hose did not freeze up. Used this in combination with foam pipe insulation over the heat tape. Indicator light and thermostat worked the way the should. Used to heat RV hose to camper trailer we were living in for a few months until DEC. 2010. Will work for those who have an RV with water hook-ups and other applications I am sure. Sold the RV and sent the pipe heating cable with it.
1,lost in the darkness,"I'll have to say the first book in the series was the best written of the three. It was what kept me interested in the story, and the reason I finished the trilogy. The second was an enjoyable diversion, though not as well-written. I wasn't completely satisfied, but decided to read the final book because the first had been so good. This final book in the series wanders aimlessly around, a thick molasses of prose dragging on. Finally, it completely loses itself with the ending. Even an epilogue fails at an attempt to recover the loss.I would recommend that you do not read this trilogy unless you've already started. It starts with a rush only to falter to an agonizingly slow pace, and then finally it completely disappoints you with a wreck of an ending."
2,Somewhat better than the 1st two,"If you read the first two books in the trilogy, go ahead and finish. If you haven't, don't start.As stated numerous times in the listed reviews, the ending left a lot to be desired. The plot twist upon her return did not follow the thread of the story up to that point and it then just abruptly ended.CDT's prose is oustanding but her placement of the details is often times suspect, interrupting an action part of the novel with drawn-out, detailed descriptions that leave you wanting to skip the prose to find out the outcome of the action. At times, the action sequence ends and your tossed into a different sequence where you are unsure of the outcome of the previous events. I found myself skipping back to see some sort of resolution, but none existed. The first book drove me crazy in this aspect, the third still exhibits this characteristic, but not as bad.I'm just a person that can't stop reading a trilogy once started. But this one almost changed me in that regard."
2,A new Genre: Fantasy/Romance :(,I read this series when it first came out and wish I had stopped at book 1. The writing style is agonizing to read. The story and concept is excellent but the writing style drags on and on. I've never read a romance novel but I expect it would sound like many parts of this book. I read the whole series and unfortunately each one gets to be more and more like a romance novel. Reading this series was somewhat tolerable as you can just skip over pages and pages of the descriptive text and not miss a thing. It's really ashame because there was so much potential here and I really wanted to like this series. The faerie lore is the only redeeming quality and the reason for the second star. The best part was that the ending left no room for a book four.
5,an excellent and clearly written textbook,"A superb book on mammalian physiology. It integrates from cell to organ physiology whenever is possible avoiding excess of details. All chapters are very clear, but the chapters concerning renal physiology and hidrosaline balance are so clearly written.The illustrations are very good and simple, which definetely help to understand concepts like renal clearance. Gastrointestinal physiology are also updated and easy to understand, especially the topic of gastrointestinal secretions.Endocrine physiology integrates the knowledge at cellular and molecular level to understand the actions of hormones and the regulation of the endocrine system. In summary, a very well organized textbook which can be used in physiology courses for medicine, pharmacy and biochemestry"
4,Wonderful historical summary,"This is an excellent and well researched historical summary of the the Byzantine Liturgy - ie that of the Eastern Rite and most orthodox churches. The author's erudition shines in this tract. For those who live this liturgy weekly it is very helpful to know the rich history and origins of its modern form. This knowledge will aid in the appreciation of this gift which has been handed down to us Eastern Christians through the centuries. It is a quick read and a captivating one. I would have liked more specific details around many of the hymns and parts of the liturgy, but nonetheless - this is a great work. I would recommend this be in the library of all Eastern Christians."
3,Good for what it was made for.,"THIS IS NOT A GENERAL PURPOSE FILM. It's more of a sport film. Lets just get that one out of the way. Do NOT use it to make portraits, or take pictures of your family, etc. However, if you want to take great sport shots, and don't want to spend $1000 on a lens, grab a roll of this. At 4x6, grain will be there, yes, but it won't be that bad. At all. Action will be crisp, and you might even be able to move your lens off the bare minimum f/stop. It might be advertised as a ""low light"" film: most low light situations should be shot with a Tripod and normal film, for best results, although this will work just fine. Bottom Line: yes for sports, no for general use."
1,Not the paddle pictured,"The paddle I received did not have the hooks as displayed in the picture and called out in the item description.Returned the first paddle expecting the correct paddle to come in the second time, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.Taking the good with the bad, lower price but automated process that doesn't allow for correction in some cases. Amazon gets it right most of the time, but not with this product.If you're looking at this product, go ahead purchase the one that's almost like it, but is $4 cheaper because that's the one that will be shipped."
5,APEX 460 REVIEW,I FOUND THE APEX 460 TUBE MIC TO BE COMPARABLE TO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE STUDIO MICS.I HAVE ONLY USED IT FOR VOCALS SO FAR AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE SWEATSOUND.THE MIC IS VERY QUIET WITH VERY LITTLE OR NO NOISE AT ALL.THIS MIC IS A KEEPER AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH MINE.
2,VERY uncomfortable grip,The hard plastic with the finger scallops just does not feel natural in my hands. Go for foam or rubber grips without finger grooves and you'll be much happier. I don't mind working out but these are just a pain in the ass.
1,"Save your money, these are absurd","Absolute garbage. In fact I do not believe anyone can use these effectively. The design is flawed, they hurt the hand. I have been using grip exercisers for 35 yrs and have worn out many after years of use. You will never wear out these Valeros because they cannot be used!! The grip design is so bad it is painful to use. I returned mine. Paid return postage and a RESTOCKING fee. Look elsewhere."
1,Turns gray,What a waste of over $70.00...When first printed the photo is a lettle dark and then it just keeps getting darker. I purchased the cheap glossy paper from office max and it worked great and stayed white.
3,Interesting reading but...,"It seems to me that while this was interesting reading and it was ""fun"" to relate the events in the book to the events that actually took place, I too think the writing was mediocre and that the last few pages were hastily written. Was it a novel, a journalists take on Clinton & company, a chronicle of events, or a publisher's dream come true?! I think it tried too hard to be all things and sell copies via the media hype and anonymity, and in trying to be all things to all people in tthe end was a disappointment"
5,A book that is both fascinating and frightening.,"This book captures the reality of the American primary system in a way that only fiction can. It looks at the strengths and weaknesses of todays politicians, which in turn sheds light on American presidential politics. This was truly a fascinating book that should be a must for all students of politics. It is also an extremely well written piece of fiction that draws the reader in and is just as exciting as any thriller"
3,Errortastic!,"[...]Basically the author meant well & goes in depth into all aspects of the PIX, the book was well ordered and logical.That said - the grammar & explanations weren't always up to their best.. but the best bit of all was in the erros ..sorry errors.Errors in text, spelling, diagrams - it got to the stage where I didn't trust any of the diagrams & would double-check it all against cisco's site..All-in-all - good try but let down awfully by the errata.If you disagree with me try my website htp:/200.200.200.928...as it would appear in the book........MS"
1,The psyllium pits!,The recipes were the pits. They consist of hard to find ingredients. When you finshed reading the recipe it didn't even sound like it would be satisfying. The recipes call for flaxseed and psyllium for baking. I think psyllium is one of the main ingrediants in Metamucil. What are flaxseeds? Sorry that does not spark my appetite. This is just my personal opinion.
1,Bohm says to,"The Casting and vienna po""Hey guys, one mo time for ol time sakes?""Vienna/casting : ""sure why not""There, my review. One lonely star.If you fail to understand, THEN here: everyone is past their retirement.I expect at the end of the yr I'll have 20 votes in the No , not helpful box, and Zero in the yes Paul's review was very helpful:-)"
3,did not make me happy,"I bought this DVD because I had watched it on T.V. I tivo the movie which was on in 2 nights, but something happened to my cable box & I had to return it to the cable people. I lost all of my movies, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was one of myminiseries that I lost. When I found it Amazon I quickly purchased it, but was very disappointed with it, you cut almost half of the movie out. Scenes like when she went to the Kennedy compound for thefirst time, She sat with Mrs Kennedy, & then she called over Joe, thats not in there, another scene when she was having lunch with her daughter it wasn't there, Scenes with Onassis were cut out, I'm very disappointed with the DVD.Unless you can correctly copy a movie made for T V, then don't make one at all"
3,just ok,The bag is too short to fit comfortably on your shoulders. The material was fraying at the end when I took it out of the box. It heats up well in microwave and retains heat about as well as similar bags. Smells like rice when heated. I bought a different bag for $5 on sale at Aldis and it is much nicer and longer.
2,"Some good, but a lot bad","It seems ironic to me that Mr. Levenkron says in this book how self-injurers are treated with contempt and misunderstood, but he himself misunderstands the basic facts. He bases his conclusions on self-injurers merely from a few girls he sees himself, and there are faults with this: one being, most of the girls he sees have been abused in the past, and while I admit that many are abused, not all self-injurers are abused, a fact he seems to overlook. As he says in his book, self-injury needs more attention, and I agree, but I'm not sure as if this sort of attention is what the sufferers need. A good book if all you're interested in is one person's view but if you want a balanced opinion, pass this one by."
3,"This an important, albeit popular account of self-mutilation","In ""Cutting"" Dr. Levenkron has done for self-mutilation what he previously accomplished for anorexia, namely bringing a disturbingly prevalent yet underappreciated topic to the surface. In this respect the book succeeds. As cutter and anorexic, I found the book lacking in depth particularly when it came to the issue of how to break these viscious behavioural cycles. Clearly, no book can accomplish that which requires extensive therapy. These critisisms notwithstanding, ""Cutting"" is an extremely valuable addition to the paltry literature on this disorder and I believe will serve as an excellent ""talking tool"" for self-injurers to, as the author describes, build a bridge out of their suffering."
5,A good insight on cutting,This book is about people who cut and has ways to help cutters overcome their addiction to cutting as a means of escape and find better alternatives to this destructive lifestyle.
2,I must be the only.......,"I must be the only ""cutter"" that didn't come from a broken/abusive/etc home.Though I found some of the book informative, the focus on child abuse throws me for a loop."
5,This book is very informative but also fun to read !!!,"I started reading this book and I couldn't put it down! I, myself, was a cutter. I found the book to be very accurate and interesting. It was also comforting. I had the opportunity to read obout others like ME, or more I how used to be. I would definately raecomend this book!! It is very helpful for someone who does cut and it would also be helpful in informing those who know someone who cuts. Definately a good book."
3,"some good information, but not what I was looking for","This book provided some good information, a few things I could identify with, but overall wasn't what I was hoping to find. As a person with a long-time cutting problem, I was hoping to find guidance to help me stop. The author seems to primarily focus on one segment of cutters; teenage girls who come from dysfunctional families. I'm not a teenage (I'm much older), and I'd like for my family to be able to read something also, to help them understand my problem, but this wouldn't be appropriate, since the author seems to at every opportunity blame the young self-injurers problems on her family.I'm still looking for the right book for me, this definitely wasn't it."
2,Too narrow and high ankle,"I wore these only once. I wear a woman's size 11 and need a wide and deep toe box, so for sport shoes I often purchase men's size 9. The toe box on this show is too narrow for my foot and the ankle too high."
3,Needed more clarity,"I was disapointed in this movie in some ways. I work with adults with aspergers and found it to be not so real in some ways. I would have liked to seen more on they both developed their relationships to be better and not so much on them being in bed and having intercourse. That to me was a turn down. I would have liked more of a way to show how they were able to cope together more and see more of the subtle ways of aspergers develope. Its a ""3"" star movie but its a ok version of aspergers if one does not know about them."
5,mind-rendering,Never have I had a book possess me as this one did. Tosay it is arousing and sensual isn't enough. I want to become part of the kingdom. Three of these books aren't enough
1,rude nasty book,"I had heard of this many years ago. I remember some although not all, I may have ditched it then. The sexual nature of the book is repulsive. I would not recommend this to anyone. The writing is poor and immature, one better in the rubbish bin then on your book shelf."
1,The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty,"I have always been a fan of Anne Rice, but this book I did not enjoy at all. I love a good steamy novel, but that was flat out porn, and I just couldn't get into it at all"
4,For Whom Was This Book Written?,"I'm start out by saying whom I think should NOT READ THIS BOOK:-victims of violent sex-those who oppose same gender sex, whether male or female-those who oppose slaveryYou get the picture. Now on the other hand if you dream of being someone's little sex slave, boytoy, etc. then this book is for you. The story is quite interesting and elegant. I enjoyed Rice's exploration of the psychology of domination and submission. Great read for those who dream of serving sans the clothing."
2,A strange strange tale.,"I bought the book on a recommendation of a friend. That being said, I am quite the snob when it comes to 'erotica', especially BDSM erotica, as that is very close to my own heart. Now, even ignoring the fact that female submission turns me off, I decided to give this book a try.The female lead, character. Wow, what can I possibly say about such a one dimensional character? Boring. Boring. Boring.I did, infact enjoy the book. Not really because of the numerous spanking sessions (tedious much?), and definately not because of the idiotic main character but because I enjoy the fantasy that such places - even in fantasy exist.That is the only reason this book got any stars at all. As for the rest of the trilogy? Since there is no negative star rating available, I just won't bother."
2,Disappointing,"I read this book all the way through because I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did. As many others have said, there is a lot of spanking in the story. Also, I know everyone has different preferences in the erotica department, but this book did absolutely nothing to titillate my senses, and usually I can appreciate quite a variety of styles. I felt absolutely no connection with the characters, Beauty is pretty young in the story (15, yes I know back then this was a more acceptable age, but still!). And I really never figured out Beauty's character at all. Nor do I want to read the next two books to even try to figure her out, it is definitely not worth my time."
5,Amazing!,"I have read the books and misplaced them. I am so waiting to download this to my Kindle so I can enjoy it again. This book is not for everyone but being the submissive that I am, I enjoyed it emmensly!"
2,Repetitive,Somewhat repetitive and I'm not into books that glorify rape fantasies. Not what I expected at all. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,"Pornography, no other word for it","I read this series when i was just out of high school. It was the first pornography i had ever read. And trust me, there is NO mistaking the fact that it is porn. It is as explicit and kinky and graphic as anything you might read in Penthouse. If you happen to like that sort of thing, and i'm not saying i don't, you might be put off by the fact that there is very little story here and the characters are entirely undeveloped. Do not buy this series thinking that it will be like anything else you've read by Anne Rice, who wrote these books under the pen name A.N. Roquelaure. It is nothing like anything else Rice has written. There is not one vampire/witch/supernatural being of any sort in them. Its about princes and princesses who are taken to be sex slaves in this weirdo S&M kinda fairy tale world. I recommend people pass this up unless they just want to read porn."
2,disappointed and disturbed- NOT was I was looking for,"I picked up this book because I was looking for some erotica and I am fan of Anne Rice's other work, however I was extremely disappointed. As other reviewers have said, the ""spanking"" was so redundant it was annoying, the plot was non-existent and the narrative was only so-so.Most importantly I was NOT aware when I bought this novel that it was so strongly S&M;, nonconsensual acts etc. Some people may enjoy those fantasizes(as fantasizes ONLY) however, pain, the threat of infliction of pain and explict descriptions of forced sexual activity do NOT arose me in the slightest. Unless you are a fan of S&M; I do not suggest you purchase this book."
1,Degrading,I thought this book might be fun to read with my husband. I was wrong! This book is very degrading to women and I don't recommend it to anyone. It is going in my shredder to be recycled into something usefull..
2,No Witch or Vampire Sex?,"I don't know, this wasn't really my cup of tea as far as erotica goes. Spankings and beatings of ""plump little buttocks"" is all fine 'n' great if that's what really gets you off, but you won't find much else here, especially not lesbian action, as Anne Rice is only sexually interested in straight and bisexual men. I gave this 2 stars for entertainment, but it really deserves 3 stars for being technically well-written (good writing style, but plot is still sucky), and there are some good sexual descriptions. But for some of us, the story is either too boring or the sex not too much of a turn-on. But hey, to each his own. Differ'nt strokes fer differ'nt folks!David Rehak..."
1,Offending,I recently read that if you liked 50 shades then this was a must read. Not. In the first 3 pages I was so offended. It wasn't sexy it was awful. The Prince essentially rapes Beauty while she is still sleeping from her curse and when he finally kisses her to wake her he immediately treats her as an object. I tried to get past it because a friend told me how good it was. I couldn't get past 40 pages and took it back and got a refund. NOT 50 shades. Not respectful. Demeaning.
1,not very good,"This book does not sound like Anne Rice at al. It is not well writen, the story i poor and is not even sexy as claimed."
1,Beware,"Complete waste of time and money. Read the other reviews before purchasing, which were 50/50 and took a chance. I'm the loser."
2,Didn't like it,"When I started reading this book the feminist in me was screaming. I am not a hardcore feminist, but I was doing a concentration in Women's Studies and after reading half the book I could not pick it back up."
2,Meh...,"I had to force myself to finish the book. I have read other Anne Rice books, such as Interview with the Vampire and Queen of the Damned and loved them, but this book was so utterly boring and repetitive that I put it down several times. At one point, I thought about abandoning it completely. Also, the rape and constant humiliation of a fifteen year old girl isn't exactly appealing.Oh, and Anne...A penis is just a penis. A butt is just a butt. And a vagina is a vagina. Address them as such. Not everything needs a pretty synonym."
2,Like getting spanked with welts to go with it? Or maybe being humiliated is more your thing...,"The book does what the forward claims; there are scenarios and in depth details almost on every page, which is what ""seduced"" me into making this my first erotica book.The book got two stars instead of one because the writing itself is decent and saved it from a one star. The story is about a 15 year old princess who fell asleep for the 100 years, so I guess she's technically of age, becomes a love slave and learns to lose her fear. Basically.There is A TON of spanking and humiliation with a fair amount of bondage mixed in to lighten things up. Not my thing, which is why I would not recommend it."
1,Not my style,"Could not get into the book. Had a hard time with it. I have enjoyed other Ann Rice books, but this was to much."
2,Was not captivating.,I would definitly not compare this to the Fifty Shades Trilogy. I was not expecting this type of story line. A little to perverted for my taste.
3,Story of O in hose and flouncy dresses,"Enjoyable because its different - I hated the Story of O because it took itself too seriously. The fairytale setting helped dilute the effect of some of the heavier S&M scenes. Beauty is a bit wimpy, and the male protagonists not greatly attractive. Some bits made me uncomfortable (the bits touching on circumcision in the 3rd book). However, it was quite refreshing, and a nice read for the bath (something to dip into!). I'd be pretty embarrassed if someone caught me reading it."
1,Disgusting,This book claims to be like 50 Shades of Grey. It is NOTHING like 50 Shades. This book is full of endless torture and rape. The sexual situations are not consenual between parties. I read about half of the first book and then returned the second and third. This is very dark and very disturbing. Not sure why someone would write and sell this garbage.
1,Not what I expected,I guess I did not realize what I was getting. I have read Anne Rice before and liked her work. I thought it would just be a racier version. The S&M was not to my liking.
3,Repetitive S & M,"An intriging twist on a classic story.The book starts out great, very descriptive, but as it moves on, you just see the same thing happening over and over, after the first ""spanking"" you'll be shocked, by the end though you've read the same thing so many times, just described different that it just loses all meaning."
4,My Prince!,I have been a fan of Anne Rice since I was a really little girl and my mom read all of her Mayfair Witches books. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect from this series and although it did give me a completely different spin on the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty it was a very welcomed spin at that! I read all three in 2 days and it gave new meanings to all of my dom/slave books that I have read in the past. Her empowerment that she gets from being a slave is what is the sneaky part to me about how this book creeps into the delicious erotic world that she has been able to create and sustain in this series. I was pulling for a different Prince throughout the book but either way....the ending is as happily ever after as I ever thought it could be :)
3,Harsh but addictive!,"If you are looking for a 50 Shades follow up, don't read these books. 50 Shades was much tamer and hardly torturous in comparison unless you like that kind of writing. Although once I committed to reading the books, I found that I had to proceed to finish all the books but I was disturbed by the amount of torture the characters had to endure and all the while naked. Some things were too painful sounding to read through and it bothered me at times to the point that I just didn't want to read on. I did finish the story because I always want to know what happens in the end. If you are timid and faint of heart do not read these books. They are a bit shocking in some aspects."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would...,This was the most horrible book I have ever attempted to read. It made me feel ill and I burned it to get rid of it! It is degrading and disgusting.
1,Sadism,This is a twisted novel of sexual torture. I cannot believe anyone could enjoy reading it. I am even more bewildered that some one could even have these thoughts and not be institutionalized. I have enjoyed her other books and this was a real shock.
1,Spanking,Bought this series after reading the reviews on 50 Shades of Grey and how this was so much better. Ha! If you are into a very repetative story. The only thing in the whole book is how to spank someone in a million different positions. Stupid!
1,Totally disappointed,This trilogy was recommended to me and I was so disturbed by it. I only read 40 pages and found it to be violent and unpleasant. Pure pornography! I was so uncomfortable with it and I am no prude!
2,Couldn't shake the disturbed feeling,It simply is not the type of story that appeals to me.It's essentially a story about stockholm syndrome with a lot of sex. I cared for one character and even that felt a bit hollow.
5,Whining and Whipping,"Sexual seduction and fantasy at it's best! In today's world, we need to indulge in some sort of fantasy-like atmosphere. If stress is knocking at your door and you love reading, then take 'Sleeping Beauty' in your hands and get lost in a fun and different world."
1,I threw it away!,There was nothing in the book that was a little erotic. It was about teenagers being raped and beat. I didn't even finish it; I just threw in the garbage.
1,Horrible,I thought this was one of the worse books I have ever read. I definitely would not recommend to anyone.
1,Waste of money!,"What happened to Anne Rice???? As a long time reader of her books I decided to give this book a whirl. Within the first 2 pages I was shocked, horrified and disgusted. How can anyone think this non consensual relationship is erotic? Its flat out rape! She is merely an object to him. If you want a real book to follow after 'Fifty Shades Of Gray' thats also better written then read 'Bared To You' by Sylvia Day. That story has real erotica, romance, and humor. I tried to read a few more chapters hoping Anne Rice wouldnt let me down. But rape, humiliation, and being forced into servitude is not what I look for in a book."
2,It could have been better,"I bought this book hoping that I would enjoy it. For the most part it wasn't bad, but I wish I had not paid the full price. It was an OK read once I moved past the spanking scenes, which seemed to dominated the storyline. I have no intention of reading the rest of the series."
3,Let's not be silly,"I wouldn't normally review a book which has already been so beaten into the ground with reviews (over 200 here) but many people have obviously missed the point. If you are going into this book with the expectation that it will be at all realistic or great literature, first of all you are out of your mind. This is not a work of literature, it is erotic fiction, and this is clearly stated either just before or just after the title page of the book if memory serves. This is ""an erotic novel of tenderness and cruelty for the enjoyment of men and women."" That is all you should expect it to be. It is more flowery, more poetic, better written than what you will find when you pick up a Harlequin novel, but it serves the same purpose.Don't get all self-righteous and pretend you picked up this book as anything but masturbation fodder. Give me a break."
4,Love!,I loved it! Some say it was too much spanking but I was ok with that. Can't wait to read the next one!
2,Boring and Repetitive,The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty was a big disappointment. It lacked the detail most Anne Rice readers are used to from her Vampire series. The book was extremely repetitive. You can only read about someone getting spanked so many times before it is no longer erotic and just plain boring.
4,Try it!,"I think 95% of the readers of this book read it because they heard something like ""What?? Anne Rice has written a porn?"" Yes she has and - she succeeded! This book is well written (yes, also the ""action""-scenes) and shows that she really has the talent to write such a book, too.A warning: People who don't like S/M too much will maybe be put off by this book, but if you like it or it doesn't bother you - go ahead and read it!"
4,No Plot. But Good Sex.,"I am a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. And compared to the undertone of sex and violence her ""Chronicles"" explore this trilogy is a little under par. There really wasn't any plot to the stories.But I did enjoy this trilogy. Anyone interested in good hardcore bondage will enjoy reading these adult Sleeping Beauty stories. They aren't for the weak at heart or the romantically inclined. But they are erotic, violent, and full of roping and spanking. That comes with the lifestyle and anyone familiar or attached would enjoy the books candor.If you're interested in some stories purely based on violent sexual content, here you have them. Enjoy them for what they are. I did."
1,Terrible story,"This is a terrible story. Way too sexual and I mean ridiculous, right off the bat. Pick a good story instead of this waste of paper."
3,"Loved the pug, liked the book","As the owner of 3 pugs, it's soon apparent that the author knows pugs. I love reading dog books and books on pugs are few and often silly. I laughed out loud at Clara as she reminded me of one of my own. Through the book I grew to love Clara and found I did not care for the author nearly as much. This was a really good read for the first 2/3's of the book. Then it suddenly changes into a completely different story about foreign adoption, and I don't mean pug adoption. After the author and husband leave home to pick up their adopted baby, there's barely a mention about Clara or her sister pug Sophie. If you're at all interested in adopting children from other countries, then you have 2 books in 1. If not, then you still have a good read about a remarkable dog, even exceptional for a pug."
2,a touching - and sometimes disturbing - book about pets,"Kaufman's writing about her adorable little dog is charming and spirited, but before I was half-way through with this book, I was wondering about her motivations for adopting a little Russian child (shades of the ""little brown babies"" in ""Murder on the Orient Express""!). I think it's a touch hypocritical to on the one hand extol - and write a whole book about - how dogs are as emotionally and personally viable as people, and then on the other hand to just blandly assume that any dog will be shunted aside to a large degree by any human child. Still, I smiled a whole lot more than I frowned during the course of this book. Definitely not just for pug-owners."
2,A spoiled dog and a spoiled owner,"Sure, Clara comes off as a spoiled dog with a better life than her fellow humans. And I can forgive Clara for that. But I had a tough time being as forgiving to Clara's owner who ends up sounding even more spoiled and whiny than her cute pug. Kaufman, Clara's owner, manages to tell us not only how she indulges her dog, but that she shops at the most expensive New York department stores, travels to Siberia in mink, and attends therapist sessions with her dog. I also found myself questioning her adoption of a child. Interestingly, that she admits she has some insecurities about adopting a child of a different ethnicity -- but doesn't see the hypocirsy of her complete devotion to her pugs, whom I assume do not look like Kaufman either. A disappointing book. written with large heapings of hyperbole."
3,"It works well, but....","The colors are totally off. The blue is navy and the ""charcoal"" is actually chocolate brown."
2,Deceiving Product,"I read the description for this product and it says that it fits most 15.4"" notebooks. I have a 15"" Dell notebook and it barely if at all fits in this case. I looked at the product information on the piece of cardboard that it came with and it said that it's for 15.4"" MAC computers. Mac computers are definitely a lot thinner than other notebooks so this product can only be used for Mac computers and not anything else unless it's just as thin as a Mac. Make sure you do your research before purchasing."
3,"Could be better, October 19, 2003","The Angel Factory by Terence Blacker was good but could be much, much better. Tomas Wisdom and his best friend Gip are best friends, when Gip hacks into the Wisdom's computer and finds out that his family are angels. Thomas finds out a lot about his family that he has not known. This is a very well written book but at some spots it gets boring or confusing. The Angel Factory is a great book but is not one of my favorites. Someone who likes to read a book with lots of thing going on this is the book for you."
2,"Well written, but troubling message","I've seen this work compared with Lowry's The Giver. I believe this comparison is easy to make but flawed. While both books are addressed at an audience ready to face questions about individuality and society, Lowry's hero faces a society of man's own creation. Blacker's title says it all. While never directly addressing religion, the book cleary suggests that intervention from ""above"" is evil and to be mistrusted. A Christian parent might want to read this book before giving it to their child. It is very well written, but clearly anti-religious."
2,Rather tippy,These bamboo pieces intrigued me but not the kids. They tip easily and the grand kids don't play with them.
4,"Good, but not great","Let me preface this review by saying that I am a trumpet player.This is definitely a ""good"" Debussy album, but there are a few points that keep it from being ""great."" First, in ""Nocturnes: Fetes"" the trumpet fanfares are a little sloppy. The slower sections of Nocturnes are exceptionally beautiful though. The strings and chorus in Sirenes are heavenly.In Jeux, I also find the brass slightly lazy. Other than that, It is a wonderful performance.As for La Mer, I found the climax of ""De l'aube a midi sur la mer"" unexciting. I thought the tempo was a little slow, the percussion including the tympani and gong had not enough impact, and the players seemed to be holding back. Also, in the final moments of the peice, I find a lot of inner detail missing which is odd considering that Pierre Boulez is known for bringing out inner detail. For a better recording of ""La Mer,"" I recommend the recording by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony."
2,Bridges of Madison County DVD,"The DVD was okay and I needed it for a gift (which I was late for - my fault). I received it in 5 days but it arrived totally smashed. It was packed in a stiff yellow envelope but needed more packing. The outside of the package was marred but not ripped open. But when I opened it I was horrified that the entire case was crushed. I delicately took it apart and it seemed that the DVD was untouched so I put it in another generic case that I had around the house. That was disappointing because the case it came in was very attractive and I couldn't fit it in my case. Because I was late with my gift, I didn't have time to send it back to you. The price was right, the service was quick, just bulk up on your shipping a little."
3,It is Streep's triumph. Watch it for her.,"She is brilliant. She makes every moment work. I think this is one of her best performances. Alas, the movie is not up to her talents. Eastwood's direction is often static and wooden, and the same can be said of his performance. Honestly, there are moments in this movie that are as bad as anything in Plan Nine From Outer Space. Feel free to FF past any and all scenes that do not involve Streep, ESPECIALLY those involving her now-grown-up children. Just watch every minute that Streep in, and see how a great actress can transcend some less than stellar material."
4,Meryl Streep's perfomance is wonderful,"Meryl Streep's perfomance wonderful. Eastwood does journeyman's work. It is the best of the late century ""Love Stories"" which I don't intend as a condmnation by faint praise. If you like Steep and Eastwood (I do) this is a film for you, though the message is a garbled and the moral of the story is weak."
5,Favorite movie of all times,"Simply put...a classic tale of three beautiful souls and each questioning if they have chosen the right path for their life and wondering if they should change courses, seeking a more fulfilling life in their latter years; or should they be simply grateful and embrace their life, as it has been."
2,"Wonderful acting and directing, disgraceful story","It is rare that I get offended by a movie. This one did it. Meryl Streep is married to a wonderful husband who she completely fails to appreciate. He's nothing. Take a hike, jerk. The man she falls for, to the point of insisting on being buried with when the time comes, is some guy who drifted into her life for a week while her husband had taken the kids on a camping trip. Sure he's a nice guy. But what kind of advantage is that. Who will a woman be more excited about - her husband of 20 years or some handsome new guy who falls for her while hubby is away? This ditz seems to think that she and her lover are doing the family a favor by not splitting up the family. Who the hell is she? I hope her husband had a few dozen girls on the side. It would be hard to find a more unappreciative or a stupider wife than the one starring in this movie. He's a photographer. Whoop de doo."
4,WoW..This is a must see.,well well..the scene at the stop lights when meryl had her hand on the door handle was a classic...geez you guys have to watch this movie.Meryl at her best Clint in a fine role.I watch mostly unknown movies and seldom see films with major stars in the cast but this one actually has two top flight names in the casting list and I actually rate this film highly.Set in the 1960's in a quiet reserved town a lonely married woman finds love when a stranger comes to town; while her family is away for 4 days these two strangers fall in love.I recommend this.
4,What a sad film for middle agers to watch!,"I loved this film. It was very sad and tragic, much like most people's lives are when they hit their 40's and 50's. It has exceptional acting from its main stars, Streep and Eastwood, however the opening scenes had horrible acting from the surviving children of the main character. That is the only reason it got 4 stars from me instead of 5.I really enjoyed the final 20 minutes or so. Without giving the plot away, it moved me in a way that cannot be described, only lived. If you want to watch one of the best romantic stories ever put on film....get this film!"
2,I agree with the viewer from San Jose,"I would award this film one star were it not for the strong performances by Streep and Eastwood. However, there is the inescapable fact that this movie is a syrupy toast to the ""wonders"" of adultery. Of course adulterous affairs are potentially more romantic than committed relationships: they are generally shorter, more like courtship and less like the sometimes grind of the daily round, and -- most importantly -- novel. Now, I cannot speak from experience on that; and I hope I never will. But finally, as painful as much of this movie is, the book is ten times worse. That man simply cannot write (e.g. ""he was a strange stranger""); I am ashamed for us all that it ever topped the bestseller lists. Fortunately, its -- and this film's -- 15 minutes of fame are apparently long since over."
2,An Average Romance,"Despite the convincing performances of both Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, this movie is too slow, long and repetitive for its own good. The plot is interesting, even if it doesn`t bring nothing new, making for an enticing enough relationship with some subtle moments. Problem is, it also drags in most of the scenes, and the constant overexposure of the lead actors becomes tiresome and unappealing. The settings could be more diverse too, since at times it seemed like I was watching a play and not a film. And although it never reaches corny melodrama, it gets too sappy at parts. Overall, not a bad movie, but not a masterpiece either. Far from a must-see, it still is worth watching once, though."
2,Should have read more carefully,"I was looking for a new copy at a good price. Should have read more carefully. Product of Canada. Terrible copy. My old version on VHS looks better than this. Surprised, as I always thought anything that came out of Canada was top shelf. This was the third item in this order that I've been disappointed in. Spend a lot of money at Amazon as I am disabled and housebound. Not happy."
5,Great condition,This book showed up early and was in the exact condition that was described. I will not hesitate to order another book through here.
5,Great Birtwistle's chamber music in a marvellous recording.,"Pierre Boulez long relation with the music of Harrison Birtwistle comes from the very early times of the Ensemble Intercontemporain as can be heard in this CD in all its splendour, even if this is a chamber CD of very little and concentrated pieces.The instrumental playing is very ""boulezian"", clear and precise, making Birtwistle music much more continental, as he is, together with Ferneyhough the most ""european"" british composer.I know another very good recording of Secret Theater, by MusikFabirk with Johannes Kalitzke, recorded by CPO, a bit more ""modern"" in style than this. Both are wonderful recordings.The recording is very good, very clear and perfect for chamber's music.This CD is now out of DG's catalogue, but you can buy it in a double CD released by Decca with Birtwistle's music, No. 468 804-2 , together with Panic & Earth Dances by the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Dohnanyi, a great CD too."
1,Readings Not Accurate - large acidic bias,"Bought these and one other brand of test strips. My first reading was around 5.0 and after going back and reading reviews on this product, I did what one other 2 star reviewer did, tested our water (well water with a lab test of neutral 7.0) and got a reading of approximately 5.5. Conclusion, these strips are not accurate and heavily biased to the acidic side. I concur with another reviewer, they are probably intended to be biased to sell some of their alkalizing products."
5,strips,Use occasionally to test our ph. Nice to keep tabs on the ph balance so we can adjust our diet accordingly.
2,A Dishonest Mistake,"I absolutely abhored this book and I regretted buying it. Though the explanation of the English sec. was acceptable, I was mostly upset with the way the explained the math format. They made the simplest concepts having to do with prealgebra or basic algebra more complicated for people who either know it or not. I agree with one of the reviewers who claimed that the questions were harder than questions on the actual ACT. I answered sample English questions online from the ACT's website and I easily got them correct compared to the ones found in the book."
4,Excellent but not great!,"It puzzles me that anyone would want to buy this Salome when 2 of Leonie Rysanek's Salome are available. If you want Bohm, go for his set with Rysanek under RCA. That 1972 performance was lauded to the skies at its premier - utterly thrilling, Rysanek's firm, expansive and stunning voice ringing out gloriously at the climaxes. Her voice, esp in the upper register, has this incomparable floating quality that made her famous. And in Superb Stereo too!! Gywneth Jones is excellent. But her performance will not go into the hall of legendary operatic fame. Good as a second set. Inadequate as a first set."
4,A Smart Songbird as well,"What makes such a Lady singer so dear to her followers?!She is smart: She seems to put every note carefully in its place.Good taste: You'll get no bad orange in a dozen.She knows her place.Great background: She'll always be along with the best musicians in the place. Junior Mance Trio was the gifted piano-bass-drums for this session.That's Irene Kral!And this package contains the Bob Dorough classic ""Better Than Anything"", his intelligent and delicious lyrics and music.Also the powerful ""The Meaning of The Blues"" and Ray Noble's ""The Touch of Your Lips"" and a sensational uptempo ""Nobody Else But Me"" to close the program."
4,Second time reviewed,"I love greatest hits albums that we put out before someone got MEGA-POPULAR. This is one of those. Great songwriting on this one, but not the hits you will now hear on the radio. More country than rock on this album."
4,This is the one,Arabic is a pretty tough row to hoe for anyone whose previous languages are romantic. I've tried a couple of these CD-ROMs and this is by far the best. This is the one to get.
4,"Great idea, good book","This book does offer some insight to training equipment that can be built/used at home. The first 22 pages are spent convincing you of the need to train; this seems out of place for this book. The next 10 pages discuss using a towel, a fairly common technique, I thought. 20 pages are spent on ""blocking sticks"", this should not be new to anyone who has trained with a competent instructor. These pages were not very helpful and could have been put to better use in my opinion. BUT - this book shines in the chapters that cover ""Heavy Duty Striking Post"", ""Choking Dummy"" and ""Small Hanging Bag"" construction and use. The directions are clear, the techniques simple, and the materials readily available and cheap! This is what makes this book worth the price. If you are disciplined enough to work out at home this book will fill a need."
2,better off with a headlamp...,"This thing lasted about a month. I kicked it over once, the bulb died. This light takes a special bulb, the bulb replacement almost wasnt worth it. It throws very little light, I just ended up using my headlamp most of the time anyway. The headlamp is always pointed where you're looking. This thing is not bright enough to just set it down and light up an area."
4,Otimo relogio,"O visual deste relogio e demais, adorei. Eh um relogio caro e acho que ficou faltando um alarme. O esquema para usar mais de um fusorario eh uma pouco complicado para visualizar, entao estou usando so um horario mesmo. O esquema para acertar o relogio parece ser fragil, ate agora nao apresentou problemas, mas nao me deu confianca. Dizem que a pintura preta dele sai com o tempo, o meu esta novo e ainda n apresentou este problema, mas se apresentar vou me arrepender de nao ter comprado o sem pintura."
2,flawed bracelet,The watch bracelet does not conform well to smaller size wrists. The design of the bracelet is flawed at the lug interface. The bracelet does not pivot enough at the lug interface which forms an arc and therefore creates a considerable amount of gap between the side of the wrist and bracelet. I regretfully had to return the nighthawk due to this issue.
5,Classy Shoes,"This is a classy and expensive looking pair of shoes. And from what my grandson (whom I purchased them for), said, they are very comfortable to wear.I am very pleased with the price and the look of these shoes."
4,Nostalgic Children's Classic,This is a nostalgic children's classic. Enjoyable silliness with delightful pictures. Creative in both the writing and the funny little brownie illustrations. It makes me smile from cover to cover!
1,This is not what I ordered,"I ordered the newer version of this book. ANd I get the old one. I guess you do get what you pay for, but they should not be advertised as the same book when they are not."
4,A New Type of Thriller,"By the Sword is a well thought-out, believable, and compelling novel about what could happen in the Middle East today, especially in relation to Iran. The authors never took the easy way out of a difficult situation, and there was never a time when I thought, ""Oh, come on."" My favorite parts were the sections about the underground church and the characters in that church, but the main character, Amber Robbins, had virtually no faults, making her a bit hard to connect with. However, most of the other characters, especially Mohammed and Rida Faheedi, and Davood and Mrna, were sympathetic characters and very interesting. Overall, By the Sword is a good book. The strongest parts are the plot, the settings, and the scenes with the underground church. Mike Yorkey and Rick Myatt need to write a sequel soon!"
4,Works like the one that it came with,Never misses a beat. Glad Amazon offers this as I lost my original and I needed a replacement. Too bad Garmin had to make it so propitiatory in the first place.
4,Worked perfect,Just needed to replace mine after I left it in a hotel room. Worked just like the original. No complaints.
4,Works great,works just fine. I lost my other base but had the usb cable. I've tested with other standard usb cables and it works also. I'm guessing that's not the manufacture recommendation but haven't seen any difference. Kind of expensive but way cheaper than buying a new watch.
4,This is Indie Film Making!,"I am a big fan of low budget independent filmmaking and Sean Wilson (11) Down Time is a maverick achievement. Shot on a shoe string budget (check the stats), this is no Hollywood action film, but what you get is from the gut film making. Gritty performances by WilliamVan Nolan and Sam McBride make this a stand out film in the low budget arena. Some of the card playing scenes reminded me of the film Clerks (1994) with lots of off the wall snappy dialogue. You could also compare it to some the jail scenes in Jim Jarmusch's Down by law (1986) both films have lots of long still shots that just kind of hand there and make you feel the oppressive boredom of prison life.Sure there are some technical problems with this film and some of the side characters acting is weak but you have to be able to over look that. Down Time is what independent filmmaking is all about."
1,don't buy this stuff,"I have used this dog food for years. About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price. I continued to buy it. No one told me there was any change in formula. My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time. She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked. She was ok there. Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water. I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs. I will not go back to Canadae. Keep away from this crappy dog food. If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies."
1,New formula nothing like old!,"We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare. We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people. Then they changed the formula. They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers. The change sent my dog into a tail spin. Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms. And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food. After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems. She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time. Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly! Talk about adding insult to injury! Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with. Wish I could give ZERO stars."
1,expensive and my dog didnt like it,its difficult to rate dog food. i guess you look at the ingredients and if your dog eats it then its good.well the ingredients were great but my dog didnt like it and its pretty pricey. thats all i can say.
3,"Food is Great, Delivery was BAD!","I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online. The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall. The only issues I have had are with the delivery. One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere. The delivery time is also something that needs improvement. I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th. It took a week before it even left the facility. It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery. Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly."
5,pro foresters use this one,"This is the second one we have purchased, one for us and one for a gift. This saw was recommended for us by a forester friend. He's right- it really works efficiently and is no trouble to wear in the woods in a belt holster. Great for trail clearing and maintenance."
3,This Girl's Got to Play (not sing),"I just started getting into smooth jazz about 2 months ago and ""This Girl's Got to Play"" was only the sixth or seventh album I purchased of the genre. This album is solid, no doubt. My biggest complaint, however, is that I have never been a fan of vocals on an instrumental album. Satriani did it back in his ""Flying in a Blue Dream"" days and it didn't go over so well. Neither do they here. I can deal with one vocal track but three (""No More Blues"", ""This Girls Got to Play"", and ""Talk"") is two too many. To be quite honest, she's not that great a singer. And while her ability to write music appears to be quite solid, her lyrical writing is not. While I have yet to purchase other albums by Cooling, my understanding is that this is not the best one to start a collection with. Now, having said all of that, songs like ""Expression"", ""Green Impala"", and ""Toast and Jam"" are very well done. An overall solid album but not great."
3,This Girl's Got To Play (MORE LEAD GUITAR),"I am a very big fan of Joyce Cooling, having all her CD's. I ama guitar player as well. This new CD has some nice tracks: Expression,Camelback, Toast&Jam,to name a few. What I was hopingfor was to hear longer solos and more up-tempo tracks. Joyce issuch a fantastic player, and her band is superb. Although Joyce has a really nice voice, it's that fiery guitar that makes Joycea knockout guitarist. My personal favorite disc to date is""Playing It Cool"", which I feel really captures the range of her talent. I also prefer more up-tempo CD's. Joyce is still one of my absolute favorite smooth jazz guitarists. Maybe on Joyce's next CD, she will ""turn up the heat"" a little bit."
2,"Honestly, Jeremy Ain't That Beguiling a Bunny","The best things about this book are its quaint jacket illustration, the 40-year-old picture of the author and her daughter on the back cover, and its built-in bookmark. It appears Karon's been given free rein to pubish just about anything, based on the best-selling popularity of her ""Mitford"" series. There are TONS of better things available for children."
1,Not very helpful,"As a senior I took AP Physics, and this was the text the teacher used. Not the text I used. The information is there, but the writing is not interesting at all. Also, other texts, such as Physics for Scientists and Engineers or Fundamentals of Physics, present more complete information than found in this book.Practice problems in this book are also very week. In particular, problems difficulty is not given, so someone who wants to practice physics really has to look for a problem that matches the level of challenge they want in a problem.If you must use this book, there isn't much choice. But if you can, find another text."
3,Typical Pleaser Boots,"If you have bony legs, you'll love these boots! They are not forgiving to any sort of wider calf or thigh... which is why I said.. they are typical pleaser boots. Also, they are very thin.. so I suggest being careful in lacing and buckling them."
3,the cat from hue,"This over-800 page book (paperback version) is the personal memoir of a front-line television reporter (john laurence) during the viet nam war. This book is much more about Mr. Laurence, than about the viet nam war. Those interested in the latter will probably be disappointed. The book describes in detail mr. laurence's professional experiences as a journalist and this should be of great interest to fellow journalists. He also briefly discusses his personal growth during the viet nam war and some political aspects of the war. there is not a great deal of combat reportage in this book. This book also does not address in any detail whatsoever the personal experiences of solders and citizens affected by the war, nor the political, cultural, and historical aspects of the war."
2,Good 4 Looks not Quality,"unique idea but horrible product. if you're just going for looks, go 4 it. if you're looking for quality, don't purchase this item. I've owned this item for about a year and now it's in my childs closet just holding toys only. it's very, very cheaply made and for almost $90 bucks it could have atleast come with dividers and a way to close the fake drawers. I had to buy baskets as dividers/containers for the clothes but that didn't last long because after putting the baskets in the doors wouldn't hold completely. Mind you I did measurments and the baskets did fit but there is no real latches or anything to keep the door closed. That's my major complaint about the thing is that the doors always just kind of flew open with no real way of securing them. So I finally stopped fighting with it and just let my children put toys inside (which they don't) and that was the end of it. So after a year of owning it, it just doesn't get used AT ALL! It's just there for decaration."
4,Pretty decent.,"Much of this is really great. A few are flawed, but still OK.The Pachelbel Canon is a rather trivial, repetitive work that has had its shallow depths plumbed better than von K does it here.The allegretto from Beethoven's Seventh is played a little too fast for my liking. He seems more interested in the destination than the journey. There is no doubt that von K knows where he is going, and how it all relates and progresses, but some of the intrinsic beauty of the process seems given short shrift. Rather like a hiker looking farther ahead instead of looking around as he moves forward, missing the little niceties at close range. A little slower tempo or more variation of same has helped other composers do this more to my liking."
2,book,"The book had a torn page in it, but I really didn't like the book. Had i liked the book, I would have kept it in spite of the torn page. It had some recipes that were of interest, but overall didn't like the book."
3,Not for True Shakespeare fans,"Judi Dench's narration is indeed excellent but, to me, that's all it was -- mere narration. Her delivery was so ""sing-songy"" that it put me to sleep. The characters in Midsummer Night's Dream are mischievous, perky, and even quirky and should be interpreted as such. Further, interpreting and delivering Shakespeare should involve deliberate observance of HIS punctuation, as opposed to the expected drop in vocal intonation at the end of every rhyming line.With all due respect to Judi and the reviewers who loved it, I was very disappointed."
3,A Midsummer Nights/ Dream,"Although I am a great admirer of Judi Dench, the spoken interludes are an unwelcome interruption of the music which in itself is very well done."
2,What happened?,"It's amazing how much damage Joel Schumacher was able to do to the film.Unlike the first two films where the characters were fairly deep, the characters in Batman Forever are boring and one-dimensional. Jim Carry is the only bright spot. This isn't helped by the terrible script.Schumacher tries to make the film bright and flashy but ends up just making a very campy looking film with high production values. The Batman series was ment to be dark(even in the comics) and Schumacher shouldn't have tampered with it.The only good thing about the film is a great soundtrack but it in no way makes up for this lousy movie."
2,"Not terrible, but not good.","Since I gave Batman & Robin 1 star, I'd guess I'd have to give this 2. It's better, but that's not saying much. I have a real problem with the characters. TWO-FACE is NOT the Joker with an ON/OFF switch. He's a real complex character with a good/evil side, not a quiet/loud side. I also didn't like the blink-and-you'll-miss-it introduction of why he is. The RIDDLER is NOT the Joker in pajamas. He is a cold, calculating insane genius. Val Kilmer is pretty good as Batman, although I'd like to see Batman portrayed as the brilliant detective he is. Chris O'Donnell. If he was the Jason Todd Robin & not the Dick Grayson Robin, I might have been able to stand him. He's a dull brat with absolutely NO screen presence."
2,Completely strays from what makes Batman so good,"What the hell happened in this film? Why did Tim Burton and Michael Keaton have to leave? Tim Burton's interpretation of Batman's world was dead on: a dark and Gothic setting where the lines between good and bad are a little blurred. Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman was excellent. He captured Batman's double side perfectly.This film, however, [stinks]. It's much too bright and happy. Batman is supposed to be dark and Gothic. That's what makes it so good! Gotham is turned into a disco and Batman just becomes some grunting, homoerotic slob. This film is a disgrace to the Batman franchise. The director of this film should've been run out of Hollywood on the rails for desecrating such an awesome franchise.I give this film two stars because I liked Jim Carrey's portrayal of the Riddler. He captured the insanity of the original TV character in an awesome way."
4,THE LAST GOOD BATMAN MOVIE,"THIS TIME, THE CAPED CRUSADER [VAL KILMER] MUST STOP TWO FACE [TOMMY LEE JONES] AND THE RIDDLER [JIM CARREY] FROM DESTROYING GOTHAM WITH A BRAIN DRAINING DEVICE. MEANWHILE, BATMAN STARTS TO FIND A PARTNER IN DICK GRAYSON AKA ROBIN [CHRIS O DONNEL]. THIS WAS THE LAST OF THE GOOD BATMAN MOVIES. VAL KILMER ACTUALLY WASN'T THAT BAD OF A BATMAN AND CHRIS O DONNEL WASN'T THAT BAD OF A ROBIN NEITHER. THE MOVIE WAS ENTERTAINING. I'MA SAY THIS RIGHT NOW, THE NEXT BATMAN MOVIE COMPLETELY MURDERED THIS SERIES."
3,An average superhero movie,"This is definitely not a very memorable Batman experience, but anyway, I enjoyed it somewhat. The cast is good, the effects are cool, the plot is so-so, and it's often funny. So I recommend this DVD, I guess, but not too much!"
4,Batman Forever-great movie,"This isn't Batman or Batman Returns but it is very entertaining and fun to watch. You can't blame Joel Schumacher for going for a more crowd-pleasing and fun approach, like 2OO1 going to 2O1O and OHMSS going to Diamonds are Forever. This is a good movie for several reasons. The Oscar nominated photography is very well-done and revolutionary especially the during the building jump and BatWing sequences. The special effects are incredible. The sound is perfectly done also. Watch this you wont be disappointed"
2,Deluxe DVD . . . for this?! THIS is why there is a 'Batman Begins',"The bottom line is that this is where the franchise, built legitmately with Tim Burton's creepy/comic atmosphere and the unlikely/perfect casting of Michael Keeton in 'Batman' (1988) and 'Batman Returns' (1992), took a complete nosedive.The first sign of problems is the utter incohence of the casting. Neither of the actors playing title character nor Harvey Dent wanted a part of this.The only redeeming aspect of this film is the introduction of Robin. And that is what makes it one star above 'Batman & Robin' (otherwise known as 'Batman on Ice').The primary problem is style. Let me put it this way - I SHOULD not really be able to guess Joel Schumacher's sexual preference by simply watching his Batman films. It really would have had more legitimacy if he had just taken the film and made a musical out of it."
2,make that 1 and a half stars,"I liked it as a kid, but I saw part of it as an adult and the acting is absolutely painful, especially Carrey and Jones. The script is also long-winded and choppy. The riddles that the Riddler conceives are really stupid and predictable. This movie was terrible, yes, but not because of Val Kilmer. He actually made a good Batman."
4,Holy metal rocks Batman!,"This is the third movie to the Batman movies. But the sad thing is Keaton isn't Batman, it's Val Kilmer. The dark edge isn't there but the villains are more evil then ever. Like the last one Batman faced two villains, he faces Two-Face a man who doesn't care about anyone else he just want's to kill Batman at any cost, next there is the Riddler a man who is gives out insane hard riddles every crime he does, he also want's to kill Bruce Wayne. Batman is not alone though, he has Robin to help him on his quest. The movie stays very true to the comics and is kind of funny, most people will like it and kids will love it. So enjoy!"
3,Colorful but hammy.,"Batman Forever is the only Batman that Val Kilmer portrayed as the Dark Knight. He is pretty good but the director refused to work with him again because of his attitude? I think all actors have an attitude problem? Nicole Kidman plays the new vixen in Bruce Wayne's life, she's kinda wooden in this, these blonde bombshell roles don't fit her. Jim Carrey is a hoot as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones is surprisely entertaining as well. Good colorful film but the hyper style comedy is a little too much."
2,"Horrible, but at least it made me laugh","Oh god, what wasn't wrong with this movie. 1st of all what's with the nipples on the batsuits, was that really necessary? 2nd of all the actors were all wrong. I mean I love Jim Carey, but I don't think he was quite right for that particular role. Honestly, if you're a harecore batman fan this movie is definitly not for you. Of course if you were a hardcore batman fan you probably have all ready seen this movie. Personally I loved it, probably not for the best reasons but at least I can give it some credit. So if you need a pick me up watch this movie, it lets you know that somebody's more of an idiot than you are."
1,"Batman is back, but it's not Keaton.","I loved the first two Batman movies, but I hated this one. This one stunk! Jim Carrey is so annoying as the psychotic Riddler. Scarface, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was pretty cool. However, this movie just wasn't as dark as the first two films. And Val Kilmer is no Micheal Keaton, who played as Batman is the last two. I think Kilmer makes a lousy replacement for Keaton. The plot in this movie is poor. The script stinks, too! Sorry. That's the way I feel about this silly mess. Batman is old anyway. How about some James Bond or Jackie Chan. Their movies are a heck of a lot better than this."
2,Batman Forever,"Batman Forever is a marginally better movie than the fourth one in the series, the film has a plot it has better acting & the cool bat suits & good vehicles especially the Batmobile (Although the Batmobile in Batman & Robin was pretty cool too. ) Which isn't saying much. which stars are good i rate this 2 1/2 stars"
5,"Outstanding, comprehensive, exactly what I was looking for!","I was craving a book that would objectively give me information about the denominations in our country. I wasn't looking for a novel on each denomination, just a solid background sketch, and this book does just that. It really has any denomination you could want info on, and is organized just beautifully. It gives membership statistics of each denomination, and hte historical info as well as theological positions of each denomination is outstanding. Praise God for this book. It will be on my shelf within reach for decades to come."
2,Save your money,"EA should take the Cinematic cameras in Return of the King, and shove them up their ???. They only succeed in hindering game play. This is purely a 'reflex' fighting game, with strategy thrown out the window. Nothing more.Forget the so-called 'Combos' and special moves... they are not only frustrating to use, but totally worthless in combat.The only reason I award it the score I did was for the excellent graphics, soundtrack and cinematics. The rest of the game is worthless.Fortunately for me, I bought the game as a 'pre-owned' title at a local store, at a drastically discounted price. I'm sure glad I didn't buy it new at full price.Save your money for The Third Age."
4,Great resource,"I love wine...and I sell it, too! I had seen this book while out in the market, and had to get it for myself. The maps are very detailed. One minor drawback is that it seems selective in what it highlights, it details certain regions, while leaving some out - some that I think are important. Still, a great resource!"
5,A very good wine reference book.,The World Atlas of Wine is a reference you need to have close by when searching for information on Wine Countries and overall wine information. It has illustrations and pictures that give you an idea of wine countries. Highly recommend. This issue is 2001 I hope there will be an update soon with the latest since last publication.
2,this is it,"max has finally gone kaput!the first reviewer said it best so I'll keep it to-the-point-stick with sepultura and forget soulfly's plain and rediculous existance.this cd is even more trendy that ""3""!needless to say,after I listened to the whole thing I did just as I did with the damageplan cd and traded it in @ the used cd store for something worth the money-fear factory's ""archetype"".now that's an album!but anyways,I am officially done wasting my hard-earned money on soulfly and max cavalera's selfish,egotistical crap.this stuff may be ok if soulfly was opening at a gig for a band you actually like,but otherwise,nuh-uh! 2 stars cause it's not quite hoobahskankish.happy 4/20 all."
1,Should have gone straight to TV...,"Physical beauty counts in films, and Brosnan and Mooreare stunners. That said, Moore cannot play comedy, soBrosnan's repartee scenes with her are a complete waste.Not since ""Yes, Giorgio"" have I heard such stilted andwitless dialogue, and these writers were not writingfor an opera singer, but for movie stars, large-calibremovie stars. Noticing that Brosnan's production company,Irish Dreamtime, was a major player in this mess, we don'thave the usual commercial interests to blame entirely.So,turn your video to no-sound,and enjoy the lovely Irishscenery, and the marvelous physicality of Brosnan. No onegets into a limo as he does in the last scene but one.The man has the build of a dancer, and is drop-dead elegant."
3,You have to fight to keep your marriage alive...............,"Julianne Moore (Audrey) and Pierce Brosnan (Daniel) are the odd balls in this romantic comedy, that has them facing off against one another in divorce court.Opposites do attract...Straight lace, stick to the rules, sneaking snacks Audrey who has some weird addiction to the weather channel. Audrey due to her career as well as her mother is uptight and filled with tons of insecurities.It's a job, use what works, unkept Daniel whose an published author, as well as a press favorite. Daniel doesn't hide that there is something special about how he feels for Audrey.It wasn't what I was expecting, there was an immediated attraction and it didn't have much to do with the cases like I thought that it would.I would have loved to see something different, not so familiar where they know that it's there but try to avoid the obvious.I did like the ending, the dancing, and the way that they complimented one another."
2,He's arrogant; she's insecure. But somehow they find love.,"Starring Julianne Moore and Pierce Brosnan as two divorce lawyers who find love, I couldn't help wondering how these two talented people could have agreed to act in such a silly bit of fluff. But I guess they're entitled to make their own choices.Laws of Attraction is one of those lightweight confections that are upbeat, lively and has zippy background music. It's an old fashioned theme with classic gags and the comedy depends on the rhythm of the dialogue.Even though the plot was set in modern times, and Julianne Moore cast as successful attorney, the romance was controlled by the Pierce Brosnan character. She was made to look stupid and childish and ridiculous in every scene. He's super confident and arrogant; she is insecure and vulnerable to panic attacks. Both of them eat junk food and they find love only after lots and lots and lots of alcohol.Fans of romantic comedy might get a chuckle out of this but I was bored throughout."
2,Boring conglomeration of romcom conventions,"Two top divorce attorneys with differing styles (Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore) find themselves married to each other while on opposite sides of a high profile breakup.This is just a tired, tired rehash of romantic conventions we have all seen a million times. Brosnan, Moore, and the rest of the cast are good and manage to invest the film with some fun on occasion, but they are completely let down by the creative team on the other side of the camera."
4,Good & Sturdy,"It took about 3 weeks for the item to finally ship from the distributor, but it arrived very quickly thereafter.The quality of the cart is very good and sturdy. They send clear instructions & extra hardware. Only a Phillips Head screwdriver (or a drill, if you prefer) was required for assembly beyond what shipped with the cart. It took 2 of us about half an hour to put this together.The only negative was a slight ding in the stainless steel top along one of the edges. It seemed more hassle to repackage & ship back than to accept the ding as is."
4,great purchase,"this is beautiful. It took a few hours to put together, but once all together it is sturdy and well made. I wish all 4 wheels locked (only 2 lock). it looks great and we love it."
2,Not well made!,"I bought this for my daughter for Halloween. It seems true to size. The outfit was not sewn properly at the seams, so therefore has small openings where there should not be. Also the Spiderweb collar, velcro's onto the inside of the outfit. I don't know how they got it to stand up in the picture, but I can't seem to figure out how to get it to stay like that. It just slumps backward and pulls the neckline apart. I am highly disappointed with this costume!"
2,Not as good as the first three,"I was really disappointed in Babycakes. There were inconsistent changes in the characters' personalities, except for Michael. Also, the ending for Mary Ann and Brian was far too convenient. I wish I had stopped with the first 3 novels."
1,Boring,"Babycakes was not as good as the first Tales books. In fact, I only read half of it and even that was too much. The humor and suspense that was so much a part of the first three books was conspicuously absent in this book. Babycakes left a bad taste in my mouth, and I doubt very seriously that I'll finish the series."
1,Very disappointing,"After reading and loving the first 3 ""Tales of the City"" books, I couldn't wait to read this book. What a terrible shame - I started to hate characters that I'd fallen in love with, and had considered them my extended fictional family. I just hope this isn't made into a movie too, or even more fans will be disappointed."
3,Furthers the story,"I am hooked on the Tales of the City books, and this is the fourth installment. I'm not as delighted by it as I was by the first one, but I absolutely would recommend it if you've just finished the third book, Further Tales of the City."
1,It sucks!,"Don't waste your money. It continually falls off of the pole and has no effect in the deep end of the pool. If you insist on buying it, get yourself a pair off goggles and dive in and scrub by hand. That is the only way it works."
4,Good film but I may be biased!!,"The reason I watched this film is because I have a connection with the real story. For me thats always what makes this film real and brings back many memories. Sadly I did think the acting at times was a little less than desirable and those english accents were poor at times, although the story behind the film will pull me back to watch it again and again. Actually quite funny for me seeing Carshalton portrayed as such an American town!! Its nothing like that in real life - our door numbers rarely go past the hundreds in England!! The DVD is better than the VHS purley due to the extras - Craig is 25 now and fit and well and its nice to hear him on the DVD. For anyone who liked the film Marion Shergold released a book many years back called 'a mothers story'. Thats a very good read and I would recommend it highly!!"
1,Difficult locking mechanism...flimsy construction,"We purchased 2 of these gates for the bottom and top of our stairs. This gate is flimsy and cheap. The locking mechanism aligns with an eye clip, and you have to ensure both the bottom metal hook sits into the eye clip while at the same time squeezing the top lock to open it then grasp around the top eye clip! Not an easy thing to do...it also does NOT secure the width of the gate, it has an open sliding design so if you over-slide it you're jamming the metal gate locks into the wall. My [...]was not able to squeeze the lock, and I also had a difficult time. I would NOT reccomend this gate, it's too chintzy and difficult for day to day life."
1,The phone clip couldn't be removed.,The phone clip couldn't be removed. So I couldn't use the product.
3,Pretty in Pink,"GOOD - This case is great quality as far as the durablility of the material goes. Love the color. Love the easily removeable clip. BAD - The back piece has to be removed every time I need to charge my phone because the hole size was not made accurately. To take pics, you need to make sure the clip is facing down because it is in the way of the camera."
2,product good but bad delivery,I received my product 1 week late. Vendor told me they shipped it out on the 9th of the month but in reality they only shipped it out on the 13th. I called them 3 times and sent them e-mails and nobody got back to me. Trying to track the package was horrible since it only tells you when the package left and when it arrives at your house since it was sent regular mail. This was just very aggravating. Will I buy from this place again??? No. Like I said product is good but delivery was bad.
1,Skip This. Won't stay closed!,"Cheapest quality and design. Good size for pocket, but snap-close mechanism & design will NOT stay closed. The SLIGHTEST nudge plastic case pops open, everything tumbles in pocket/purse. Make me wonder how anyone, with clear conscience, would market this. POINTLESS PURCHASE."
2,color not as shown,I ordered this pill box for my husband to carry in his pocket since it was flat. In the picture it is shown as white and when I received the box it was pink. This did not work for what I was purchasing the box for.
1,broke 2 days out of warranty,"Length:: 1:04 MinsMy kdl-40xbr2 developed a vertical line down the middle of the screen 2DAYS after the warranty expired. Sony will not repair it. Their explanation? Watching too much tv will cause the television to malfunction and they can't do anything since it's out of warranty. I explained that I only watched it three hours every other day on the average. Their explanation? Not watching enough tv would cause the television to malfunction. Are they serious??? Both watching too much and not enough tv will cause it to break?? The image quality was great, but only for one year and two days. Customer service is bad. Don't waste your money on Sony!!!!"
1,Disappointed due to product reliability,"When the TV works, it's good. Mine broke three months out of warranty and the repair cost was very expensive."
2,Cut small,"Beware,they are cut small.I am a 38 and these do not close.They are at least 2 sizes too small.All my other 38's fit fine with room to spare.These are going back!I always love Lee jeans but these are no good."
5,Great pair of Jeans,"If you like your jeans to sit at your waist and not your hips then buy these jeans. I love these jeans, fit is great, look is great, and they're comfortable too! I purchased 2 pair of the DARK STONE jeans, ordered my normal size for pants/slacks and these fit perfect. They've been washed 2 or 3 times and I see no problems with material or construction. Shrinkage was barely noticable. Liked these jeans so much I've returned and ordered 2 more in the same color. IMHO they fit better then Levi's!"
5,Pantalón lee,Excellent pant. I like this model. Is a classic style. Since I have bought along time . It was very good. Thats way I bought again.
2,Not the same,I ordered two pairs of these pants for my husband in the size and style he always wears in Lee jeans. They looked to be the same quality as I expect and I almost removed the tags and just hung them in the closet. Luckily he tried a pair on and discovered the waist was really snug. The hips and legs fit perfectly so I'm afraid to order the next size up. I returned both pairs. Amazon made this easy and free. Sizing has gotten to be a big problem lately. This is not the first time I have reordered a product and found the sizing changed from the original.
5,Good quality,"It is thick, very strong. this Is the first time I bought&#65292;a little long pants. But i can also wear them."
1,Not the old Standard Fit,I have been wearing Lee standard fit straight leg jeans for decades. But Lee changed the pattern for their standard fit straight leg jeans in fall of 2011. So unless you have a butt the size of a bus and thighs like utility poles you might want to reconsider. You can call Lee and complain that we don't all want the gangster look. Ask them to bring back the old standard pattern. I am still looking for another brand until they do.
1,Huge! Very disappointed!!,"My husband has a 32"" waist, so I ordered 32x30 and they fell off of him! I have a very difficult time finding his size in the retail stores, so thought ordering these would be the perfect solution. Color was great but fit was a disappointment!!"
4,Work fine,"Jeans are jeans, and these are what you would expect from Lee. Size is as indicated, doesn't shrink in wash, etc, etc."
4,bueno,"Un pantalon tal y cual lo solicité, con el color y la talla requerida, recomendado para estar a la moda.."
5,nice pants!,"Deepest black, holds colour and size pretty well after repeated washing, well made, great price."
5,good,"I think it is good. And also it fit my requests, only the waist is a little big and I need to choose a smaller one next time."
2,lee jeans review,"They did not fit well, the fabric was inflexible and too heavy. My husband will not wear them anymore"
3,high cost,It is general work. But it is high cost jeans. You will not ask for too much with a $27 jeans.
4,Fits perfectly,This was the first time I shopped for a jeans online.. was a little skeptical about the fitting.. cuz whenever I bought trousers/jeans from any shop in India.. it never used to fit properly before an alteration.. but this jeans fit me perfectly.. Nothing special about the jeans though.. It looks and feels as a normal jeans should.. Definitely recommend this to others..
5,Perfect Fit,"These jeans set the mark for quality, price and fit! I'm so satisfied with this product that I bought two more pair:)"
4,FLITZ Polish,"FLITZ polish is highly recommended through out the gun community as a final polish on the feed ramps of various firearms, this product does the trick it is not the end to end all products but works a little better and has broad usability, others can be substituted such as Mothers and Semi Chrome.Order this in the 2 pound can and save."
5,"If it's FLITZ, it's good","I have used tubes and tubes of this for years, Time to move up to the big boy can. Great as a polish/cleaner for just about anything except food. Gets the bugs off the headlights as easy as it cleans the carbon fouling from stuff I have that gets carbon fouling (wink, wink). No negatives except smell and I have to admit that I might just miss it if I bought the low ordor stuff. Oh, btw, I have saved hundreds of dollars by using it to polish out XBOX DVDs that get scratched because the kids XBOXes don't hold the DVDs well if it gets bumped."
4,Good book for new kindergarten reader,"This is the classroom instruction book for my 5 year old, kindergarten daughter. She often became frustrated when trying to read other books, so we purchased this book so that she can read at home with the ease she does in the classroom. I, and her teachers, have noticed the at home practice has benefited her in class. The short , usually 4-6 page, stories are much more interesting that the Dick and Jane story books of my day. Many of the stories focus on cats & dogs, a topic most all children enjoy. The teacher has told me this is one of a series of books and I am looking for the others.This is an excellent early reader book."
4,I liked it!,"Really a large document concerning In-Ex's attempts to understand elder architects current mind set. The typography and overall layout of the book is exciting and keeps you engaged throughout. At first I thought the Australian series would be boring. Once firmly into it I realized it was an exploration into a uncommon realm of architecture. Homes built by non-architects. Commentary from the resident/builders is provided. Most of the photography was video based and somewhat blurred but added to the overall contemporary, rapid fire feel of the book. I look forward to the next edition!"
4,Down to earth,"Kathleen DeMarco really captures the overwhelming pain of loss in this moving first novel. I found her to have a great sense of humor and to capture the ""true"" thoughts of women, the one's we don't usually express out loud. It's amazing how some people do truly walk into your life at the strangest of times - such were Rosie, Louisa and the rest of the Pine Barrens gang. She discovers many things about herself including what's important and what's ""real"". Definately a good read."
2,Run on Queen,"I bought this book the other day thinking it would be a good summer read. The run on sentences are making me CRAZY. I am losing interest by the end of the sentence rather than the end of the paragraph. The content seems to be ok so far (what I can make of it), but what type of writing style is this?"
1,Hollywood Junk,"If you want to read a trite, self depreciating narrative, pick up this book. I enjoy reading, and am not a critic by any means. Certainly when picking up a novel on a Saturday afternoon I'm not searching for a Thomas Pynchon writing level. I am looking for something that I wouldn't mistake for my younger sister's high school creative writing class homework. The voice is inconsistent, and the whole story is poorly written -- sometimes I wonder if the editor just didn't bother looking at it -- there are points when it is not clear who is speaking in the room.It makes me angry that there are so many talented writers out there that can't get published but this thing is what ends up in our bookstores."
2,A Gold digger gets an album deal . . .,"Blu Cantrell first sang back for Faith Evans and the song ""Hit 'Em Up Style"" is smooth and catchy so I decided to get the album. Too bad I didn't like any of her other songs and ""Hit 'Em Up Style"" got boring real fast. Don't get me wrong, she's got a good start but I'd like to see a little more work in some of the songs. Half the songs you don't know if their a dance song or ballad which is bad at dances cause you don't know whether to slow dance or get your groove on. Borrow this from a friend and decided if you like it before you buy."
2,Thank God for swinging,"First listen to ""So Blu"" is definitely a large disappointment, she steals the vocals of Toni Braxton and Janet Jackson but falls flat on her face, as with most albums the singles totally contridict the album, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE HIT EM UP STYLE, songs like So Blu and Waste my time try desperately to save the album, however if ""Swinging"" was not on this album I think the best way to describe it is dead.Don't start thinking I'm a rock or pop fan that hates R&b, I love it, artists such as Shola Ama and Monica are wicked however Blu's whining voice is not r&b or hip hop it is simply screach, just hope she releases Swinging, buy that then stay well clear of the album."
5,ONE OF THE BEST CD'S OF THE YEAR,The shock of not seeing this album nor this artist nominated for a Grammy upset me because BLU was definately better than them all. I love this CD and encourage everyone to buy it and hopefully BLU will get all the attention she deserves for a slammin creation. By the way the released single (Hit Em up) doesn't compare to some of the other songs on this CD. Buy it you'll love it. When is the concert!?
3,A little disappointed,"I must admit I was expecting a little bit more from this cd than I got. There are maybe four songs on the entire album that I actually listen to. I guess I was looking for more of an upbeat cd that had more songs like ""Hit 'em Upstyle (Oops)"" and ""Swingin'"" Instead, I found that the cd was more like Toni Braxton - her ballads and slow moving tracks. I just was not too pleased. If you really just want the hit songs, buy the singles."
5,Water Gardening,"This book was just what I wanted to help me learn about water plants and marginal plants. It was in easy to understand, plain language and is a very concise. Great pictures and the price was right also."
5,Vitamin Shop AloeVera pills,This product as exactly as I requested. It was reasonably priced and come on time. I would recommend this product to others and definitely recomment using the Vitamin Shoppe.
1,Slow and Boring,"I'm usually never disappointed with a Linda Howard's books. I usually love both the female and male characters, but the heroin in this book is so annoying, she keeps going on and on about her late husband enough already we get it you miss him. No matter how much I read on I just never liked her.On the other hand the hero of this novel was wondeful strong silent type quick witted, smart, brave and down to earth I like that. when I finished it I felt sorry for him he was stuck with her."
5,A great read,"A well plotted book with a small town full of memorable characters. Cate Nightingale, a widow with young twin sons, is trying to make a living as a bed and breakfast owner in a remote corner of Idaho. Cal, the local handyman, has been in love with Cate for 3 years but only conditions created by inept villains staging a terrorist attack on the area shock Cate into noticing Cal as a man. Was their romance created by extreme conditions, or would it have happened anyway? (Note Cate starting to notice Cal's strong hands in the beginning of the book, and her repeated attempts to make conversation with him.) The villains' reasoning which led to their attack on the area was so ludicrous, I wouldn't be surprised it it were based on a real news event. A great book- I would love a sequel."
2,AVERAGE,"I used to be a HUGE Linda Howard fan - I guess that is why I'm even more upset that this books was such a disappointment. Where was the story? Where was the suspense? Where was the foreplay? (if you read the book you'll know what I mean!)I kept hoping it would get better... that she would develop the story and characters. However, it seemed like more time was spent describing how to make snowshoes out of sticksand on secondary storylines than on Cal, the main male character.Check out the author's earlier works... re-reading them is better than buying this book. Hopefully, Linda Howard's next novel will be better!"
2,Preposterous Plots and Characters,"Linda Howard is usually better than providing both unbelievable plots and one-dimensional characters, but not this time. While I can buy the remoteness of Trail Stop, the idea that not one person owns a satellite phone? Two super-skilled military heroes, one of whom the heroine doesn't recognize as even really being masculine until mid-way through the book? But less believable than anything, hit men who conceive of and try to carry out such a high-profile act against an entire town? And throwing in a sympathetic hit man along they way? Nonsensical and predictable plot and characters with no credibility. Wooden dialogue and no sizzle between the characters we're supposed to care about. What a waste."
1,Disappointing,"I used to buy every book she wrote. Unfortunately, both this one and the previous one (Cry No More) are losing steam. You will get a lot more from the authors such as Anne Stuart, Susan Elizabeth Phillps, Merline Lovelace (the longer stories), and Katherine Sutcliffe (the more recently written ones); their stories have all the components of sensuality and excitment."
1,Worst ever..................Sorry Linda.,"I am a HUGE Linda Howard fan, but I did not like this book at ALL! It went into WHY too many details about really stupid stuff and the plot made no sense what so ever. The book spends more time with the Villians than the main Charachters. The writing standard was WAY BELOW what Linda Howard is capable of writing. Very disappointed....................... :("
2,Boring!!!,"I found this book to be very boring. I kept telling myself that the two characters would start to interact with each other but I felt nothing for them. Too much time was spent dwelling on Cate's past and thoughts. There wasn't any tension(sexual or otherwise) between Calvin or Cate. The plot was silly and unbelievalbe. I am giving this 2 stars because it is Linda Howard but she definitely needs to go back to her roots. Remember ""After the Night"", that's all I have to say."
3,Cover of Night,"This is a good book, I started it today and just finished it, one of those you can't put down. I did eat dinner but that is all I did other than read. It came in the mail this morning and I was so excited about getting a new book. And for it to turn out to be so good made it even more exciting for me. Ms Howard is a really good writer, I think I have read every thing she has written. If you have not read any of her work, I would strongly suggest you try one of her books. I don't think you will be disappointed at all."
5,A good read,"A good read. There is drama, lots of action, romance. It is a book you will not want to put down."
2,A Real Let Down,"The plot seemed forced, contrived and just plain ridiculous. The beginning of the book focuses a lot on the twin boys, relying on the ""cute factor"" but then they just disappear for the rest of the book. Thin and unsuspenseful story line. Romantic relationship not up to par with other Linda Howard books. I feel cheated - was really looking forward to another satisfying LH book. Oh well, maybe next time."
1,Too boring for words,"I didn't remember ever reading this book and after the first few chapters I remembered why. So boring..no romance...no suspense...too many insignificant characters, etc., etc., Don't waste your time."
4,"A good novel, but not her best","After reading the reveiws prior to listening to the book, I wasn't sure what to expect; however, overall, I enjoyed the book. There was alot of character development in the beginning of the book (although mostly about Kate). The plot was over the top and I don't know why professional killers would go through all that effort.I agree with others that the last few chapters felt rushed (I was halfway through 9 of 10 CD's and still felt that there was so much more to be covered and explained). The ends seemed to be tied up too quickly."
3,Not what I had hoped for,I love Linda Howard...usually. Lately her work has not been up to par. Most of her recent books have seemed rushed and not well thought out. The stories are good but they are just lacking depth or something. I have a hard time conecting with the characters. Howard's older works (mostly written in the 80's) like the Mackenzie books and Angel Creek and Lady of the West were so passionate and I really connected with the characters. If this is your first Linda Howard book you might be dissapointed. Go back and read her earlier works. You will enjoy them more. Sarah's Child is a real tear jerker and I love that style. I wish she would go back to it. I would also love to see another western. Howard is a good author but she needs to revisit what works best and not this new stuff she has been experimenting with.
3,When Will I Learn?,"OK, this is it. No more auto-buy books from this author. I have read-- or tried to read--every book she's written. So out of desperation I finally broke down and spent hard-earned $$$ on this one and I swear if I could find the receipt I'd return it in an instant. I HATED the tension to innocent children, I didn't believe the chemistry between the lead characters for one minute. You think I would have looked at the 105 reviews before me, but I TRUSTED this author. No more--now I'm out $$$, have to re-read a keeper and am not very happy at all."
1,SOO BORING,"I want to start by saying I am a HUGE Linda Howard fan and have read all of her books. I can't believe that this was written by her. I agree with the previous reviewer about how stupid the plot was. I was not interested to see how the plot unfolded. The romance here was barely explored. These tough guys in a dead end town secretly loving two women and waiting YEARS to even express any interest. Come on! This one needs a redo. Get it from the library if you have to read it, but this is not worth the shelf space to keep."
2,Pass on this One,This is a dull read. I was really disappointed. It has a lot of suspense but in order to get to it. You have to read halfway into the book. I mean towards the end. Which truly is the most suspenseful part of the book. I have read great Linda Howard novels in the past but this isn't it. I'll wait for the next novel.
4,Poor Customer Service,"i found nothing wrong with this product,however this company's customer service leaves a lot to be desired. When I pay as much for shipping as I pay for the product, I don't excpect it to take over a week to get to me. And when I emailed this company the repsonses I received were either generic or rude. If this company hopes to keep customers they need to take a serious look at re vamping their customer service."
4,Interesting History,"From ancient Sumer to St. Louis, Missouri, from Charlemagne to Sam Adams, Gregg Smith's ""Beer..."" is the remarkable story of humanity viewed through a glass brightly - a celebratory romp through the ages, foaming steins in hand, for all those who cherish their malted barley brew. Even though this is a very entertaining & informative book, Michael Jackson is still the bibliophonic God of beer. Like suds? Read it!"
1,Where is Tristan?,"Unbelievable, this set is titled ""tristan und isolde"" but Tristan is almost a ghost. Mr Moser lacks the power and sensitivity demanded by that roll. This recording is a complete mistake."
5,One of my best reading experiences,"Just finished reaing it. It only took me a couple of days,but I've only got one thing to say; ""READ IT"". It's really full of passion and emotions, so strong that they can easily be called breath-taking."
1,Garbage. Look elsewhere,"I can confirm other reviews that complained about this product. It only adapts one channel, so it's useless to use for music. And, the ""3.5mm"" end is not 3.5mm. It's too small. After forcing my headphones into the hole, I had to use plyers to get them back out. That's how tight it is.If anyone finds a decent adapter for the Samsung Sync, so I can use my regular earphones to listen to music, please post in the comments section. I've been looking for a year now... AT&T; store in the mall FINALLY got one but it's twenty dollars, which seems insane."
3,Works great after gluing casing together,"The adapter works great. The plastic casing on the phone end came apart (doesn't snap together securely enough). Once we super-glued it together, we've not had any more problems. Great adapter for the price!"
1,Broken.,"I purchased this and it was D.O.A( Dead on arrival ). Whoever soldered the inside wires on the jack forgot one, so it only allowed one ear phone to work. I would ask for a refund, but it was only 6 dollars, and since then I have sold my blackjack."
2,Not a good book for JCA,"I was only interested in the first part of the title, J2EE Connector Architecture. It really did not cover J2EE Connector Architecture that well and the coverage was very small. As far as the rest of the book, well, your mileage will vary. This book is probably better for a person that is new to java."
4,A helpful primer on Hebrew law,"I liked this book because it really helped to get me up-to-speed on the location and contents of the major legal collections in the Pentateuch. Though some of Doorly's biases come through, he presents a mostly balanced approach to different issues that arise with studies of the Pentateuch's legal collections. It is a quick read because, as the subtitle says, the book is actually a ""handbook"". It contains many helpful charts and lists, including a list of 613 laws of rabbinical tradition that is very valuable. The chapter on the administration of justice in ancient Israel provides a great resource when reading the history books in the Bible. This handbook is a quick reference guide if you are studying Ancient Near East or Hebrew laws or are just interested in learning more about them."
5,One of the Best books I have ever read,"This book used along with my Bible and the Holy Scriptures of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, helped me during some very troubling times in my life. I have used the creeds for friends, on the job, and for having to deal with people and situations almost on a weekly basis. The creeds work, and Mr. Laurence's delivery is superb. He makes you believe you can have a miracle NOW, INSTANTLY...and the funny thing is, YOU CAN."
3,math is very easy in this book,"the verbal is much more accurate, though. the scores i got on the verbal sections in this book were pretty close to what i got on the real exam. my math scores were also pretty accurate, but that's mostly due to my practice w/ kaplan and barron's exams, not this one. i wouldn't use this book to review concepts, period, though. just the practice tests. and only the verbal tests - you can do the math to boost your ego, but you're better off doing math tests from another book. use princeton review (best overall review, but repetitive questions on their practice exams makes them not reliable), kaplan (good review, best practice tests - harder than the real thing, but probably the best), and barron's (horrible review, good practice tests - again, harder than the real thing)."
3,"Probably worthwhile, but still irrelevant","It's nice to have some real practice questions from ETS, but I'm not connvinced this book is at all relevant to the CAT GRE. The CAT is simply different and harder than paper-based tests. It can't hurt to do the practice problems - there aren't explanations for answers after the first test, so if you don't know how to figure out the right answer you might be frustrated - but I would doubt this book helps anyone to significantly improve their score."
3,gre review,"the condition of the book was fine. no ink or pencil marks; pretty clean.on the other hand, the GRE Prep book on its own is not good. expected more from the official handbook. course content is sparse and only the first practice test has explanations for the correct answers. haven't taken the test before but the verbal part was extremely difficult and confusing."
4,This book is superb,"Although the last couple people have knocked this book for not providing ready explanations, I found it to be the most useful tool for preparing for the GRE. I actually used this book as part of a Princeton Review class, and although the teacher offered explanations for the problems if we needed them, that happened very rarely. I recommend using this book in conjunction with a variety of other GRE books, like the Princeton Review ""Cracking the GRE."" If you do the PR book first, you can treat this book as extra practice. And yes, this doesn't really help with the whole computer adaptive aspect of the GRE, but you know what? Nothing really does. That format sucks. Thanks ETS for this helpful book, but screw you for the test format."
5,An introduction to diatoms,This is an essential guide for the budding diatomist. It provides structural diagnostics of the genera as well as clear descriptions of the terminology one will find throughout the taxonomic literature. An ideal teaching aid for the world's most robust water quality indicator.
1,Very Cartoon-y; expected more,"I returned this book even though it was so cheap to start with that I lost money doing so, but I was just very disappointed. Drawings were cartoon-like and poor quality. I don't speak any language other than English, and I think I could communicate better without this book (actually looks more like a cheap pocket calendar)in a foreign country."
5,Great Soprano!,A lovely recording that was like new I have been a fan of hers for years! I recommend this recording.
1,Poor quality,"My son was so disappointed when he opened the box, only to find that the leg tips had fallen off. I haven't had time to figure out if there's a way to reattach them but I'm irritated that I even have to consider the possibility. Not at all impressed."
4,Wilson Pro kick,"Its a good ball holder for practicing. But its better when someone can hold the ball on the T. But this works for when I want to practice kicking by myself! This review was given by my 10 yr old son, whom this was purchased for!His kicking has gotten better.Thank you"
2,Pretty lifeless,"Just to counter the other reviewers, I must say that I find this performance to have a deadening effect on me, and I have listened to it several times. The tempos are on the slow side, and the chance taking is nil, as is any sense of passion. I am a big fan of Rudolf Serkin's playing, usually finding it passionate and spiritual, but, perhaps due to his age when this recording was made, I find these qualities lacking here. Of course, everything is competently played, but that is all the good I can say about it. I am sorry I purchased this recording, and do not recommend it."
1,Missed the mark!,"I am not sure who this book is targeting....if you are a marketing/finance novice, his ROI spreadsheets and calculations are vague and full of holes. On the other hand, if you have any kind of financial background, you will find this very simplistic.Quick (short) read...but falls short as a resource book."
1,CRM teacher,"I was waiting a lot from this book. But the chapter are really short.Deception about Romi on Direct Marketing, more innovative about Advertising cost."
2,Snooze!,"A definate disappointment from an otherwise excellent author and tremendously entertaining series. I've read all the SSR books, and was very excited when this one came out. However, the story was rather flat and much of the ""life"" has slipped out of Slippery Jim. Many parts were entirely too predictable, while others were just plain not believable. I really got the impression that Harrison decided to do this book just for a bit of added revenue, as it seemed his heart really wasn't in it. Overall, I'd say you're better off skipping this particular entry in the tale of Slippery Jim and keep your fond memories of him intact."
4,Exellent Case,"I have a couple of other cases, this is one of my favorites. High quality material. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars if becouse the case doesnt have a screen protector. But its a great case."
1,Last 2 test kits seem to be expired,"I still have some of my original test kit left, which has white powder and gives an expected iron reading.The last 2 iron test kits I puchased on Amazon have yellowed powder and read zero at every test."
5,Great little tent for the price,"Bought this tent after setting it up in the store showroom. I have several other tents, but I bought this one primarily because it's extremely lightweight it goes up so quickly.I camped all over Alaska in this tent for 6 months last summer. This tent does not leak even in a heavy down pour. In fact, I got flooded out a gravel bar one night when the the river flooded and rose, and one end of this tent was is 6 inches of water. It felt like I was sleeping on a waterbed, but everything stayed dry inside this tent.I used this tent mostly when I was planning to spend just one night at a campsite. If I planned on staying at a campsite for several days or more, I used my Cabela's Outback Lodge as a larger and more comfortable base camp tent.Over all, it's a very good tent for the money and it's just the right size for one adult, however I wouldn't want to try and fit 2 adults inside of it."
4,Wonderfully slow,"I have great affection for this symphony, and I own about 33 different recorded versions. As David Hurwitz points out in his review, it is the slowest performance on record at almost 80 minutes! Although I usually agree with Mr. Hurwitz's reviews, I disagree with him in his comparison to Bohm's earlier Vienna recording. I think this one is better mostly due to the soloists. Norman and Domingo sing like the superstars they are, and I think the slower speeds actually add some dramatic tension. However, if you want to own only one Beethoven nine, look for Bernstein's recording with the Vienna Philharmonic or Giulini's bargain version with the London Symphony."
4,Definately good quality but don't really need it,Bogen is definately a highly recommended brand. I got the carrying strap expecting it to make my life muc easier. In the end I prefer to just cary the tripod in my hand instead of hanging another object over your shoulder. The strap has a rubber inside which prevents the strap from slipping off your shoulder. Very nice feature. Again it's just my preferance to cary the tripod instead.
2,Ceramic swirl art,"The spinner didn't work. The kids are now spinning it by hand and having a great time. If I hadn't spent $25 bucks plus 30 mins trying to get the spinner to attach correctly to the spinner plate so it would work as advertised, I might be having as good a time as they are! I do not recommend this toy."
1,Highly Disappointing,"I bought this CD after falling in love with ""Nobody's Supposed to Be Here"". But that was a mistake - it's the only good song on the CD. Deborah's voice seems not-so-strong on other songs, and I miss more upbeat songs like ""Who Do You Love"" from her freshman album. If you like mediocre ballads, then I guess this is the album for you. I don't know what she's got going on with R.L., but I definitely could've done without hearing him on every track. Tamia is a MUCH better investments if you're into ballad type songs."
4,Thanks for the Info,"I enjoyed learning about the members before Led Zeppelin and what they've done and hearing the people they played with talk about them. The DVD includes what is billed as ""The Hardest Led Zeppelin Quiz in the World Ever"". It's far from hard. The DVD looks into the past of each band member before becoming Led Zeppelin. It also looks into the first few albums, tracing some of the songs' ""roots"", so to speak. Pretty good, although I've seen better. Hard core fans *will* buy it, newcomer fans *should*."
4,Leap pad book,Received the item very fast. It was in excellent shape. My granddaughter loves it. She is no longer able to get these books in stores and it's great to be able to order them online.
2,Read Winnicott Instead,"This book changed my life - by leading me to the works of D.W. Winnicott, to whom Miller refers here and there. If two stars seem like a stingy payback for a life-changing experience, the reason is that when I read Winnicott I discovered that he had said everything that Miller says, with far greater eloquence and, yes, originality. Go to the source: read Winnicott instead."
4,The Drama of the Gifted Child,"Alice Miller's ""The Drama of the Gifted Child"" presents a holistic and I believe, an accurate, portrayal of the many aspects of childhood which, when a child is oppressed (and she defines what this oppression may look like) result in difficulties later in adulthood for an individual and ultimately for society as a whole. Her writing is accurate and to the point - a lot of information about the human psyche in a mere 130 pages."
1,Outdated and irrelevant,"I was very disappointed with this work. If you still subscribe to Freud's outdated theories, then this may be for you. Otherwise, you're better off reading works by newer researchers in the area of psychiatry/psychology. Im particular, I tend to respect those who combine elements of the cognitive, biological, learned behaviour, and psychoanalytic theories in their works.This book does little more than blame one's mother for the gamut of problems a human being goes through during life. This seems to me to be a highly narrow-minded and ill-informed approach. The human psyche is a complex phenomenon that cannot be explained with a single simplistic theory contained in a 150-page book."
2,Ok until it wasn't.,"I purchased the Coby boom box about four years ago. I liked the combination of CD, CDRW, CD-MP3 and USB capability. The radio manual tuning is way too touchy. When a USB drive is used the folder navigation is nearly impossible. An MP3 CD has pretty much the same problem. I liked the compact size and the sound quality was acceptable. We used it happily until the box quit reading CDs. End of story."
1,Coby CX-CD236 Portable CD Player with AM/FM Radio,"I returned this product because it was more of a CD player than an AM/FM Radio. I wanted mostly a radio with digital readout and programmable, etc. Returned it. Thank you. MFR"
4,Good value,This was a Xmas gift for my grandson and he is very pleased with it. I was happy with the tone quality and ease of operation
5,Daughter loves it,"It works great for my daughter's first radio. She uses it all the time; I now know many ""One Direction"" songs, great."
1,cd player doesn't work,"I bought this player just to play CD's but when I got it the CD part does not work. When you put in the CD, close the lid, it spins and makes a loud grating noise for a second then stops playing. What a cheap item this is"
4,Good quality for the money,"I was just looking for little player that would play cds and radio. I use it in my sewing room and so far have been very happy with it. Good for a small room and don't expect it blow out the windows, but does just fine for my purposes."
5,Great kids bible,"Although I don't own this bible myself, my close friend has it and used to always carry it to Sunday School when we were six, seven, and eight. It got pretty worn out and I remember we shared it often as I didn't have one. It's great for primary elementary school readers, as the font is bigger than most bibles, and the scripture itself is in a language very easy to understand. Later, even though we all got NIV bibles, I realized NIrV is the perfect kickoff for bible reading. This bible is also perfect for adults who have trouble understanding. I really recommend this bible!"
5,Jane is my new best friend!!,"SEE JANE DATE is an irresistible read. From page one, I was charmed by the bond between Jane and her best bud, Eloise. I loved all the eccentric publishing folk Jane has to put up with in her assistant editor job. Adored the too-beautiful Natasha Nutley (in spite of myself). My favorite character (besides Jane, of course) was Jane's aunt Ina. She was so real, so lovable as the nagging-but-well-intentioned mother-figure in Jane's life (""Go ahead, Jane, be single. Never get married. End up all alone like your great-aunt Gertie, God rest her soul."") Can you just picture Aunt Ina in her Forest Hills living room?? SEE JANE DATE is a must-read for single women everywhere. I can't wait to read more books from Melissa Senate! (Especially a book about Eloise, hint, hint...)"
3,"1/2, a decent read","This is a typical ""chick lit"" book, about a woman, Jane, who is trying to find a date to her cousin's wedding. The book follows her on her blind dating spree and has a pretty predictable storyline. I think this book got better as I read it, but there still wasn't anything super wonderful about it. If you like chick lit books, then you should definitely pick this up, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone."
1,Cheap knock off!,"I found this book to be the most predictable book I have EVER read. I would be ashamed to have a book that so cheaply mirrors Bridget Jones. I think that it's an insult to everyone's intelligence. Try Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic books, if you like this genre."
4,good,"this is a decent book to read, that helps you to feel normal about your own feelings about dating and stuff."
1,What a wasted effort,"I saw the other reviews and thought this would be OK, a Bridget Jones kind of book. Sadly, I think those reviews must have been posted by friends of the writer or something - because I found this book to be boring and somewhat selfish in tone. Why is it that woman who date and date and date (as the writer describes herself) think they have something constructive to say about relationships? This book (to me anyway) says nothing except that some women are incapable of tsking care of themselves, have ridiculous standards in men - standards that they themselves cannot hope to achieve. As for the dialogue: it's unrealistic and self-absorbed. Can I get my money back?"
3,Lots of tofu recipes,"This cookbook presents a specific diet for someone battling prostrate cancer. It's premise is by eliminating red meat, processed meats and dairy products one stops feeding prostrate cancer. The recipes emphasize the use of tofu. Tofu is a food that contains phytoestrogens which may positively impact prostrate health. However, it is questionable whether that level of soy ingestion is equally beneficial for women. Thus... one might need to consider cooking separate meals from someone involved in this regime.I would have like the book better had it relied less heavily on soy products for its protein source."
3,"The ""Italian Evanescence""?","The ""Italian Evanescence"", it's somewhat of a let-down after the ""In a Reverie"" album, and other than ""1.19"", no song really reaches out and makes you say ""I want that!"". Nonetheless, all the right ingredients and a very competent, fine album that does nothing to dissuade me from the idea that this is my favorite band of all time. (""Senzafine"" isn't in English.)"
5,Incredible music!,"I am not an expert in music, but all I can say is that disc is beautiful, heavy, melodic, sophisticated hard rock music. It's hard to compare, but I can think of Korn ""Untouchables"" disc. Of course, Evanescence comes to mind, but Lacuna Coil is much more sophisticated musically. The voice of Cristina Scabbia is super powerful and smooth as the same time. This album compares with ""Comalies"" as their best. If you like heavy, emotional, metal music, but with a beautiful female voice as lead, you will like ""Unleashed Memories."" To me they are the best around now. Just for reference, I also like Disturbed, Korn, Tool, Offspring, Godsmack, and some Linkin Park--but the female voice makes Lacuna Coil a genre of their own."
3,Tricky,This was a little tricky to use but in the end it will help get the job done. Becareful with the film you're trying to retrieve and don't over do it.
4,"Paler than they look, but still great for concealing piercings","This was a bit too pale to hide my 8g ear piercings as well as, perhaps, the version 1.5 Kaos hider plug. At 10', however, I passed for unpierced. Bonus if your lobes are pale. Great for piercing enthusiasts with professional aspirations. You should, however, probably get these through your local body piercing outlet, or at least consult them for a color choice."
2,"Interesting stuff, but short on facts","This book offers a humorous look at our favorite TV hits of the 50's, 60's and 70's. It is comprehensive and includes many neat vittles of information about many popular shows. It is helpful for someone trying to learn about TV and society at the time, or one who may not be familiar with the shows in question.For TV buffs, the information provided may not be new. Moreover, the book is replete with misinformation and inaccuracies, sometimes causing one to wonder if the author has ever actually SEEN some of the shows. The years of broadcast are often off by a year or two, character descriptions are erroneous, and the descriptions are sometimes just odd. I mean, even a casual fan of Bewitched knows that Tabitha had witch powers, but her brother Adam did not. Unfortunately the book claims both were witches--just an example of the misinformation.Do yourself a favor and just skip this title."
4,Lasser covers the issues of buying LTC,"This is a very thorough review of the details of understanding and buying Long Term Care insurance. You will understand what you are buying.But this book does not make any case for not buying LTC and how to analyze that situation. It is strictly why to buy it and what to buy and how to understand what you may be buying. But SHOULD YOU. That is not covered, they just assume you are a buyer and help you in that mode. And for that mode it is one of the best. Take a look at the Idiot's Guide to LTC, some additional angles worth understandig if you like to read two books on every subject."
3,HASN'T AGED WELL ...,"I've been catching up on movies I missed when they first came out, and last nightfinally watched THE DIRTY DOZEN. Sad to say, it appears to be showing its age. TheDirty Dozen, for example, are basically pussycats, with the notable exception of Telly Savalas. There's a lot of wince-inducing dialogue (Ernest Borgnine: I've nevergone for all that ""behind-the-lines"" stuff. A soldier should wear a uniform!) And the film teeters awkwardly between Boys And Their Toys comedy, and Blast 'em To Bitsaction. I'm reminded of FROM RUSSIA, WITH LOVE. When that first came out, the scene towards the end, where Bond releases barrels of gasoline from a boat and then blows them up in the water, had the audience SCREAMING with excitement. We'd never SEENanything like that before. Now it doesn't even raise an eyebrow. So watch this for apleasant way to pass the time, and a look at stars like Donald Sutherland when they were barely dry behind the ears. But don't expect a Classic For The Ages!"
4,Great Movie,Lee Marvin at his finest. This movie has quite a cast in it and takes place during WW II. Loved the part when Donald Sutherland impersonated a general. This movie is another one that I watch over and over
5,Finally,"If any film deserves special edition treatment it is this one. I also read that the made for TV sequel The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission will be included. Telly Savalas who played Maggot would go on to play Major Wright in two more Dirty Dozen TV movies. Lee Marvin showed why we all love him in these roles, he was born to play tough guy parts and play them convincingly. Marvin was in the pacific during WWII and saw action."
5,Classic movie,"I have watched this movie all my life, and decided to buy it, no matter how many times you watch it, you see something you missed the first or second time. They don't make movies like they used to, whether its filled with special effects or not; it has nothing to do with good ole' acting and story lines, not to mention humor."
3,"Horns, Hogs, & Nixon Coming","If you are a Texas Longhorn or Arkansas Razorback fan, you'll enjoy this book (with Longhorn fans enjoying it more since Texas won this ""game of the century""). There were some great players in that game, but for those who are not Longhorn or Razorback fans, you have to wade through details of just about every Texas and Arkansas starter to get to the write up of the game itself."
1,Horns go wrong,"A sometimes interesting diatribe of southern football in the late 60's, but everyone knows that Penn State was the real nation champ that year. PSU went 11-0 in both 1968 and 1969 but only ended up in 2nd place in final rankings each year. Nixon's declaration of Texas as national champ was a sham."
3,I think I'm the only one...,"I hate to rain in on everybody's parade, but this LP was ""meeeeh.""Don't get me wrong, I think this album was VERY refreshing due to the current state of Hip-Hop. It's just not 5 stars. I found their approach towards ""true-schoolism"" dope. But, honestly my favorite track on the entire album was a song I heard on a comp. disc.This is a solid effort for a debut and it shows promise in a group I will be checking for in the future. The topics of the songs are above average... I think my only draw back was the beats. Many of the beats are VERY SOLID, its just that some of the beat's samples sound out of key or the choice of samples clash with the mood of the track.All in all I'd say this is an honest effort, but think as this group gets older, their LPs WILL GET DOPER."
3,The plot thickens...and thickens and thickens,"Let me say at the outset that I am a Rankin fan. Police Detective John Rebus is a rounded human character, and Edinburgh makes a colorful backdrop to his stories, which are generally well plotted. However, ""In Black and Blue,"" Rankin was just a little too ambitious. There are enough plots and subplots for five books, and he isn't always deft at juggling them. I often found myself scratching my head and flipping back pages to remember who a particular character was (there are a dozen major police characters alone). This is a major distraction in a mystery novel, which should be read full steam ahead. The plot strands involve gangsters, drug dealers, rogue cops, the oil trade, and two (count them two) serial killers. The denouement of all this is far from satisfying: the strands don't come together as neatly as a reader would have wished.I'm still high on Rankin, but I wish he had turned this one into two separate novels (perhaps ""Black"" and ""Blue"")."
4,"Super soft, but scuffs easily","I bought this ball after much thought. Everyone has the Wilson Evolution, and I love that ball, but it is always available so wanted to add some variety. I first bouth the TF-1000, but that was hard as a rock, felt small, and overall did not seem to be high quality. I then decided on this ball, loved it's soft feel.It feels great and dribbles great, it still is not selected over the Evolution @ games or open gym, I think b/c people are afraid of change!My only issue with the ball is how easily is gets scuffed. After my first time shooting around it had lines all over it from hitting the rim or the top of the backboard. Now I have been using it for a few months and the ball still plays great, however it has lines and scuffs all over it, makes me weary on how long this ball will last!"
2,Below Average Indoor Ball,"This ball is below average as far as indoor balls go. I was torn between this ball and the Wilson Evolution and decided to go with the ball that's a few bucks chearper. Mistake.I play basketball fairly competitively about 3-4 times per week. This ball is hard and doesn't have the soft feel of the Evolution. Maybe it gets better with usage, but I'd rather pay a few extra dollars and get a ball that works great from the start rather than risking [...]on a ball and still not liking it several months later.I'm going to be returning this ball and buying an Evolution as it is the ball that is used most often at my gym. For basketballs in general I'd say it's solid, but as far as indoor only balls go I'd say it's not a great choice."
5,No Reason To Keep Looking,"There simply is no better indoor basketball available at this price. I've had Wilson, Nike, and Spaulding, and while each was okay in some way, this one is already my favorite ... after only 2 weeks. If you are wanting an indoor ball that will break-in fairly soon, that will stay fairly grippy/tacky (but not abnormally so), and does not get slick where sweat is concerned, this is it."
2,Ball not as pictured!,"I was really excited about getting the item. Paying less than half price for an official ball used for NCAA Championships, what a deal! I waited until I got to the gym before even taken it out of the box, boy was I disappointed! The quality of the ball was poor, you could see and feel the glue they used to put it together. You constantly feel the rough edges when using the ball. No way they would allow this item in this condition to be played with in a championship game of any sort. Upon further examination I also notice that the ball isn't like the ball in the picture. Everything is there but the words, ""INDOOR(WILSON SYMBOL)GAME BALL"". I am having the feeling I was sent a reject game ball! I am going to what was my first choice from the beginning, the Spaulding TF-1000. I have played with the Wilson Evolution, thought this ball would be like it. I let the original higher price fool me. Stay away from this item!"
1,Wrong Product Advertised,"This is the Finishing Spray, NOT the Body Lock as advertised. Aussie says the Finishing Spray is the replacement, but it is COMPLETELY different. It's WATER-based - weighs down your hair."
3,Good assortment.,"You might enjoy this CD more than me, as there was a little too much chorus and solo singing. I prefer orchestra only.As always, you may have heard more pleasing versions of individual pieces elsewhere. But, if you like collections, as I do, this is a fairly good choice."
1,Make sure you like organic apricots,I am sure this is completely my fault. I did not realize that organic meant they would be brown (silly me I thought the package was green like the top and that was why the picture made them look brown). These taste more like raisins than the dried apricots I am used to. I have been trying to like them and I like most organic things I have tried but this product makes me realize why preservatives are used. I am going back to the pretty orange ones that taste like apricots because these taste spoiled to me. It may be an acquired taste...
5,A LIFE-CHANGER...,"There is an elite inner circle of 5 or 6 books which have changed the course of my life; this is among them. This book contains insights heretical to conformed Christian thinking. This is not a book about learning how to be good enough, how to fix yourself, or how to find acceptance in exclusive circles...no, this is a book about discovering your deep belovedness as you are, and how to come to terms with God's unconditional love and wisdom in designing you and embracing you for His own intimate purposes. This is a book about transformation, not conformity. This is a book that will bow your head low before His presence, and lift your head high in your rightful place among men. What a place the Christian community would be if we truly allowed Him to genuinely transform us, instead of wearing the obligatory masks of conformed thinking and behaviors in wasteful grasps for acceptance and approval. I will never go back to those masks, now that I know who I am!"
3,"Flat story and characters, but easy to read","The novel focuses on the pedestrian life of Liz Dunn and how the presence of her long-lost son back into her life changes things. Trouble is, any changes she makes are slight or barely perceptible. Liz, her son Jeremy and the rest of her family are kind of one-dimensional characters and the novel itself is too boring/pedestrian to be something you'd call a truly good read. An easy read, yes. A seminal novel, no."
5,Great Storytelling,"Haven't cranked out any reviews for a while but decided to come out of retirement for this one.Excellent characters, brilliant storytelling, remarkable ending.For those who enjoy murder steeped in an historical stew, GAME OF PATIENCE will keep you up past your bedtime. Aristide Ravel is a very compelling leading man."
3,Decent Recording,"I know this quartet is supposed to be one of the best, but I've heard better recordings of Tchaikovsky's Quartet No.1 (just wish I knew who did those recordings and could find their CD).Anyway.....it's not poorly done, just not the best I've heard."
4,As commercial as the avant garde gets,"Anti pop come out with another banger. avant garde surreal imagery over Warp style beats; but wait, is that an opera chorus?; does that sound like a Gwar extra talking about killing soap scum? This album is off the hzzzy; Flex will be bangin' this every night in the Tunnel and Clue's mixtape is the next imminent stop. It hasn't left my futuristic ergonomic retro toaster boombox in like 3 years. buy this disc, then play it out like you never bought it"
4,"Simple, well written but best for adolescents...","I bought this book hoping to have an early broad conversation about sexuality with my 9 year old boy and found this book to be too detailed for someone that young. The illustrations are over-simplified and may be good for younger kids, but it doesn't jibe with the text which is more complex and biologically, fact-based. A great book- but I found I have to leave it on the shelf for another year or so. I don't think most 9-year olds will get this stuff yet so I'd advise you to hold off buying this unless you have an exceptionally mature child of this age. I'm sure it will be an excellent reference at 10 or 11."
4,Good book for Parents and Preteens,Joanna Cole gives straight answers for preteens' questions concerning sex. Parents and child should read the chapters together. The book will open lines of communications on this very important subject.
3,Not quite what I needed,I didn't find much of value in the book. The one chapter explaining the different parts of the yard was okay but I was looking for some help in designing my own model railroad yard and was disapointed. I closed the book thinking I would need a large garage sized layout to build anything of value. Nothing smaller is considered in the book. The examples of actual model railroads didn't add much (and they were all huge too) The book also reads pretty quick. In half an hour I was done with nothing more to be gained. I found much better information on a couple of personal websites. I was looking for options and I was only given one - build big.
2,not for general knowledge,This book only illustrated very specific mechanisms. Not what I expected. I do not recommend it.
5,This is a great book,"I first bought this book a few years ago and I tried to read it then, but I just couldn't. I was going through a dark time in my life and the book just brought me down further.I picked it up again last year, and I LOVED it! It was especially vivid, since I've visited Venice and I could really see the images that Anne ""paints"" in this book.It is truly a wonderful book. It does get dark toward the middle, but there is a wonderful light at the end of that tunnel. Some of the images in this book will be with me forever.One of Anne Rice's best!"
3,Surgery is more fun,"This book is disgustingly predictable. You only really need to read every tenth page or so to know what's going on. Anne Rice is obsessed with gay sex, even though her descriptions of it could make Rupaul fall asleep. Compound this with the fact that she never knows when to quit...how many times did she use the word ""commence"" in this book? Did anyone else find it odd...like she was trying to cash in on her 25 cent words..."
1,"Hard, tasteless marzipan fruits and NO customer service","No stars for this horrible, inedible, stale expensive mess that I presented to my husband on Valentine's Day as an additional gift; embarrassed doesn't even describe how I felt; the worst part, perhaps is their customer service; I sent them an E-mail, explaining my disappointment and requesting a refund-- their website says in huge letters: SATISFACTION GARANTEED! (with a picture of the boss!)-- gave them 4 days to respond, they did not, choosing to ignore the whole thing; I then called the phone # on their website which turned out to be a bogus number. ( NO SUCH NUMBER!) Nice company! And I forgot to mention shipping charges, too!I contacted Amazon, who have a wonderful, prompt customer service, and they will make things right for me, as they promised."
1,Now with Corn Syrup?,"I had asked for Mazipan for Christmas and received five of these. But soon I was unhappy. Not hard at all like the other review said but they didn't taste right. Also left an odd residue on my hand and stuck to the plate with a slick film. The ingredients have corn syrup in them, something I had never seen in Marzipan. While this is not the worst Marzipan I have seen (that one was hard ""Plaza"" brand with 3 types sugars, same as this one but swapping the corn syrup with the some other type of sugar), it is close second. Just Yuk."
3,OK,"Good article, but doesn't look like in the pictures, is absolutely original but so old and with seals from a library... and was sent it just on time... Thanks...!"
3,Over Rated!!!,"I usually agree with the Penguin guide which gave this CD a Rosette denoting something special.What's so special? the sound is not so hot nor is the performance .Listen to Bernstein and then Menuhin& you'll see what I mean.Menuhin's recording is a cross between BIG orchestra and period interpretation giving us the best of both with sound that is both transparent and full.These can be purchased along with the 38th & 39th(equally fine!)and other pieces as part of a multiple disc set.If you must,buy it used -its so inexpensive!These Menuhin recordings also received well deserved Rosettes and should be in every Mozart lover's collecion."
3,"Okay for what it is, but...","The Hills Run Red is a solid example of what's wrong with horror films today. We have nasty special effects, solid production values, and some decent nudity, but it's ultimately wasted on a mundane slasher/ torture plot that goes nowhere. We've seen this all before (particularly the ""film within a film"" plot). You can pretty much check off a list of concepts/ conventions that you find on the shelves at blockbuster: snuff movies? check. Torture? check. Hillbillys? double check. Attractive young people in peril? check again. And so on.On the plus side, if you're looking for a mindless gore flick to widdle away the time, it delivers the goods. It's nicely paced and graphic, and the always entertaining William Sadler gets to chew up the scenery in a few scenes. It's an acceptable outing, but you come away feeling disappointed that so little thought goes into these types of movies nowadays."
3,LIFE IMITATING ART?,"BACK IN THE 80S A MOVIE CALLED THE HILLS RUN RED BECAME A LEGEND BECAUSE THE CAST AND DIRECTOR VANISHED. AN OBSESSIVE HORROR BUFF IN 2009 WANTS TO FIND A PRINT OF THE MOVIE AND POSSIBLY WHAT HAPPENED. HE TRACKS DOWN THE DIRECTOR'S DAUGHTER WHO MANAGED TO SURVIVE THE EVENTS. AFTER FINDING HER AS A TRIPPED OUT STRIPPER, HE KIDNAPS HER TO DRY HER OUT AND THEN TAKES HER ALONG WITH HIS TWO-TIMING GIRLFRIEND AND BEST FRIEND TO THE PLACE WHERE THE MOVIE WAS FILMED...AND YOU CAN GUESS WHAT HAPPENS.THE FILM DESERVES AN E FOR EFFORTS TO BE DIFFERENT, BUT ONCE IT KICKS IN GEAR, IT JUST GOES OVER THE TOP GIVING WILLIAM SADLER LICENSE TO CHEW UP THE SCENERY. LEAD SOPHIE MONK IS TERRIBLE AND THE MOVIE BECOMES JUST ANOTHER BLOODSOAKED TORTURE FLICK. ALSO WATCH THE END CREDITS...THE MOVIE'S FINAL TRICK IS STILL TO COME."
3,PRETTY GOOD FOR STR8 TO DVD JAM!,"Every slasher has a name Jason, Freddy, Mike And chucky now baby face as he or she is so called. yes its cheesy but we dont go to these things for the acting we go to have the crap scared out of us Mission accomplished."
2,for scholars,"As a college student taking feminist theory courses, i felt very frustrated by this book. It is full of terms that i felt i should probably know but didn't. I found the book to be dry and difficult to read as i stumbled through page after page of jargon. It seemed as if the book were written for the world of academia, not for the general public or students just beginning to get their feet wet. However, despite the difficulty with which i read it, i did find it to be a useful and informative book, if not a pleasure to read. It is full of information about the many different schools of thought in feminist theory."
5,FANTASTIC tool -- highly recommend!,"I got the 128mb version as a birthday gift a year ago, and have found it indispensible ever since. Recently upgraded to the 1Gb and love it! The tools are useful and durable -- the light and pen on my old one still haven't worn out. Usb drive great, 2.0 very nice and speedy. The knife body provides a nice, protective cover for the chip as well.The usb stick detaches from the knife as well, in case you want to take it on the plane, or just plug it into your computer without having the whole keychain dangling there.This is an excellent gift for gadget-lovers, or pretty much anyone who carries these items (knife, usb drive) around separately and banging around on a keychain."
2,Book,"Good book, came quickly. Have not had tome to finish it yet, but I hope to soon. Stil waiting for more time."
4,Nice Moves,"Overall I'd give it an 8 out of 10 cause it mostly delivered. I had my doubts I'd actually be able to learn any cool moves, but these guys know how to teach. Most of the moves I like, although a few I couldn't see myself doing. The grinding and dancing with girls section was useful to me .. cause I had zero clue what I was doing ... The main drawback for me was I was hoping they'd teach some breakdancing moves I could use in a club to show off with.."
1,Broke the first day - very cheaply made.,"This product is so cheaply made that it broke the first day. Once the ""fishing wire"" snapped and broke, there was no way to repair it. Totally Worthless!"
2,Duh,"Bought the movie because it had Kris Kristofferson in it, big mistake....Way to much cussing and undesirable viewing. No thanks !!"
4,Negative honesty,"The book is realistic from a negative point of view but religion and life can have a more enligtened perspective. The book describes the bad aspects of religious institutions but religion also has many good ways to reinforce the quality of life. The book is true in my opinion but I would not care to live in that world of negative opinions. There are other sides to the story that would reinforce the positive things in life. A much better study of religion, if you really are intelligent, would be ""The Evolution of God"" by Robert Wright. If you can't read that book then you have no business evaluating another person's religion."
5,Love Worth Finding,This book was a gift that I gave to my husband for Christmas. He raved so much about it saying that it being written with such great details accounting for his life and written by his wife that he feels everyone should read this book. Adrian Rogers was a great spiritual man. We know that he is with our Lord and Saviour.
1,"do not buy, dont last at all","i bought these at walgreens because my crutch tips finally broke, it hasnt even been a month and they have completely worn out on the bottom and they have all kinds of slashed on the sides from walking around on them. Since i will be on crutches for the next 4 months, i will not be buying these again."
4,It's been good to us!,"We've had this model for 3 years (although didn't buy on Amazon). It's been great for us. We love that all 4 side come off for the BIG LOGS my husband likes to burn, as well as roasting marshmallow. We did have to replace the log grate last year with a sturdy cast iron one. And, the screens are starting to rust. But, it was used almost every weekend the last 3 summers. And, it's been through 3 long cold snowy NJ winters. Looking to buy a new one, and just might just buy the same one."
1,"Poorly made, do not bother!","I ordered this item and it arrived with chunks of the powdercoat finish missing, which means it will rust. I requested a replacement and the replacement item has the same issue. The problem is not with shipping, it's with manufacturing. This item is JUNK! Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent for doing Med Error Root Cause Analysis...,"Read several books and this seems to get to the heart of the matter in the least amount of time. Book is well written, to the point and will get you going within 24 hours."
2,Buyer beware!,"This review is not about the music, which is wonderful. It concerns the recording itself. For some reason the last thirty seconds of the last movement of the concerto have been cut off! It is unbelievable that Deutsche would allow this to happen. It was the case for the first one I purchased as well as the replacement copy when I returned the first. So beware!"
2,Slurpy Elgar,Perlman slurps and slides his way through Elgar's work with zero understanding of the style. Either get Menuhin with the composer conducting or the young Nigel Kennedy with Vernon Handley.
3,Good taste but must use multiple teabags,"This tea does taste good but each teabag has very little tea. I end up either combining one bag with a bag from another brand of tea, chai vanilla, or using multiple tea bags of the anise. Otherwise it is very weak. I add vanilla soy milk, no sugar, for a morning wake-me-up. Tastes good."
3,OK as far as it goes...,"While this is a fair overview of the German 'Pocket Battleships,' there are three major flaws which prevent me from giving this a higher rating. First, the artwork is pretty lousy (the color plates look like they were done on a cheap CAD program more suitable for a computer game!), and second, there is very little photography of the 'Admiral Scheer' in its late war configuration (and no accurate artwork either). Finally, it would have been a good thing to include a summary piece on the relative effectiveness of the 'Pocket Battleship' concept compared to similar-sized cruisers and/or battlecruisers, since these ships were such a radical departure from everything else afloat at the time...."
3,Better than nothing....,"Hey guys, it mightn't be the best vision of ""live"" Stephen Stills/Manassas; viz. OK, it's ""live"" in a German TV studio rather than a live concert; but ""God"" isn't making any more footage of Stills/Manassas. Better to have 3 stars of something, than 5 stars of nothing....Despite the great success of ""law firms"" C,S,N and C,S,N & Y, Stephen Stills peaked in Manassas."
2,Worst book from this author. I expected better,"the first 3/4 of the book i could do without. 3/4 of cairator development in the 6th book and very little plot development or action is a grate way to bore a reader. after the first Walter dream segment skip the rest, that never goes any were."
3,"Walter Slovotsky, center stage...no room for a plot!","I suspect that those who are familiar with the Guardians of the Flame series either enjoy Slovotsky greatly or loathe him. Since the entire tale is told from Slovotsky's point of view, don't say you weren't warned.I did find the narrative interesting--some of the most moving parts in this novel involve Walter's reminiscences, which turn out to be relevant to the plot. Sort of.And you see, that's the problem: plotwise, this is the series' weakest novel (unless it's _The Road Home_, which I haven't read). You do see some interpersonal relationship tangles--or, as Slovotsky puts it, ""musical beds""--but most of the time I scratched my head trying to figure out the *point* of everything that was going on.Read it for Slovotsky's humor and for some interesting, if extreme, first-person storytelling. (Perhaps this would have been better as a collection of vignettes? Beats me.) Just don't expect anything heavyweight."
1,LOL ...it doesn't do anything!,I have used ACT! and Qbooks for years. I needed an upgrade to ACT! but received very poor reviews for ACT! 6.0. Intuit always gives a quality product so I bought This Customer Manager.The advertising makes it sound so powerful but I cannot find much to do with it. It is like Intuit sold a shell they were developing to recapture development costs.Its kind of funny in a sick sort of way .. but I can't find much functionality in this product at all. It really doesn't do anything except list your customers and... nothing!
1,QuickBooks Customer Manager,"The product is available with a coupon for $20 off from Office Depot, but they don't see since it says discontinued. Could that be because it is filled with problems that need to be worked out including that it didn't work past 12/31/20043??? Sounds like the old y2k problems except it isn't 2000 anymore!"
2,A FUN JOURNEY ... BUT WITH NO CLEAR DESTINATION,"Boulez takes a sympathetic approach to the score, but his curious pacing leads to a rather disappointing finale. Indeed, the concluding movement of Mahler's intense, deeply personal music sounds here like an afterthought, uncertain and directionless in its mood. For a much richer, more heartfelt interpretation, try Christoph von Dohnanyi with The Cleveland Orchestra (London/Decca). You'll find the orchestral playing even more sumptuous and precise as the Viennese, a conductor with a more deep-seated place in the music, and even an extra track (the Adagio of Mahler's tenth). All told, Dohnanyi offers better listening and a better bargain."
4,Tonex does it again,"Acts 29: Under Exposed (Syntax, 2001)Unique and mellow blends of sound envelope relateable lyrical concepts. Check out ""Missionary Dater"", a song that explores the dangers of dating an unsaved perosn. Of special note is background singer, Tiffany Simpson, who makes the project extra special with her terrific vocals.For fans of: Q Tip/ Saved Young MinistasPick hits: Sweet Tooth/ Overnight/ Missionary Dater/ Family Life/ Confessions.Positive Beat DigestLaZeric Fridell Freeman"
4,Book,"Book had a little more wear on it than I was expecting, but will still hopefullly help my friend with her loss."
5,Beautiful fantasy art,"I was familiar with this artist due to work he did for Wizards of the Coast. His art tends to capture moods of fantasy novels, role playing games, etc. in ways that are, in my opinion, unmatched.So I got this book. I was not disappointed. Some of the images I was familiar with. Others I was not.However, one thing needs to be said about this collection's breadth. The material ranges from sci-fi to gothic, and from fantasy to horror. Material is provided from book covers, calendars, inside printed plates, art collections, etc.Highly recommended."
1,medicinal plants in tropical countries,"I included a review when I returned this book.It is grossly overpriced for the amount of info included. Thought it would have tons of info for the high price, but it only covered about 24 plants. It was more a text book, than a book for the lay herbalist.It would help if Amazon would list # of pages, photos, drawings, etc. for all the books you sell.Thanks"
4,Good Gift,Gave these to my Mom for Mother's Day and she loved them. They are a Consumer Reports best buy and worth every penny.
4,For Fans Of Stephen Fry,"The Liar is typical work from Stephen Fry in that it is erudite, witty and passages from it are cleverly and memorably phrased. Fry's love of language and his ability to improvise off of a phrase and build from it are in evidence throughout this novel. In The Liar Fry succeeds in leading the reader on something of a wild goose chase but the style and language he employs keeps the pages turning since it makes it so hard to predict where the story is headed. That is the strength and weakness of this book. It deserves 5 stars for style but only 3 for plot. Nevertheless reading Fry or listening to him for that matter is always a pleasure and I enjoyed The Liar."
4,Band Called Pain - 'Broken Dreams' (Land Shot),"The CD I'm covering here is actually the current pressing of the same title that apparently came out two years earlier. Really good San Francisco-based metal band that pulls it's listeners in with it's melodic, yet heavily performed vocals, crushing guitar riffs, blazing bass chords and powerful drumming. Whew! I get tired just hearing this disc. Tracks that will have you playing this CD many times again include the opener ""Holy"", the wailing ""The Pieces"" (cool video out of this tune), title cut ""Broken Dreams"", ""How Would It Feel"", ""Hellbound"", the in-your-face ""Freedom Ain't Free"" and the somewhat '80's-like ""All Over Me"". After hearing 'Broken Dreams', it is a bit difficult to believe this effort wasn't recorded in the early '90's. Should appeal to most fans of Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, White Zombie, Pantera, Nirvana and possibly Metallica. True metal fans will be licking their chops for more. Recommended."
5,"Quite simply, fabulous.","The book is not just filled with wisdom, the story is a good one, not in the manner of a ""ripping yarn"" but in an involving way. The reader actually cares about the characters. Topping this the fact that Duncan uses the language very well. This is excellent prose.Duncan's other book (The Brothers K) is very good but not as good as ""River Why"" and his book of essays (something like ""River Teeth"") is just plain excellent."
5,"A read that will make you cry, think, laugh and smile.","I read this book at the insistence of my boyfriend, an avid flyfisher and owner/operator of a fly fishing shop. Not being a fisherman, I approached the book with some hesitation as to whether I'd enjoy it. I found the story of the piscatorial and philosophical pursuits of a guy named Gus to be endearing, enlightening and entertaining. A knowledge or love of fishing is not required to enjoy the adventures of Gus nor the clever prose and talented use of language by David James Duncan. I believe just about anyone would like this book, whether they are a worm-dunker, dry fly purist or non-fisher. I plan on purchasing a copy for my father, a dreaded worm -dunker according to my boyfriend"
1,Disappointing Quality & Performance,This cutlery was a terrible dissapointment.Right out of the box the knifes were not particularly sharp and would not cut anything well.Even the serrated bread knife would not easily cut bread.My recommendation is to definitely pass on this product.
1,awful pad thai,"In my view, Simonds oversimplifies her recipes. I made the pad thai, and it bore little resemblance to the actual dish. The inclusion of ketchup on the ingredients list should've tipped me off, I suppose.I am looking for a more authentic noodle cookbook."
5,Cool,"Received product in the time frame estimated. Had too replace old burner, it finally rusted out after 5 years. This is a great way to contain and control your trash burns. I usually burn small yard trash from flower beds and junk mail. Would purchase from seller again."
3,I am Confused!!,"I am soooo disappointed!!! After ""In The Forest of Harm"", I was so pumped to read ""A Darker Justice"", I even went out and bought it brand new. Got to Chapter 13 and couldn't imagine how it could ever get better from that point. It certainly wasn't the same Mary Crow I grew to admire in the forest. Too much legal and political jargon. Maybe next time Sallie!!!!"
5,From inside flap:,"Dr. Buttrick looks first at some of the questions raised most about pain and evil. Why are there snakes and earthquakes? Why should we pay for dead men's sins? Why must I suffer? And most searching...is it possible that God himself can suffer and still be perfect in power and love, still in control of the universe. The new word he finds is Christ, his resurrection and in the faith of those who find in the Event a new way of victory over futility, pain and death. Thus pain is not put aside nor its cost denied, but is seen as a way of cleansing, a forward road for men and the church, and a new understanding of nature's complexities and man's perplexities. There is still no neat answer, but the new word is spoken from the cross, not the study."
4,Dracula,"I picked this one up for a college course. Wouldn't have necessarily read it on my own, but can add it to the list of classics I have."
1,worst experience ever on amazon,"The product has yet to show up. No one, from this outside vendor, and Amazon could/would give me straight answers. No tracking information provided, the 'manager' or some random teen from this outside vendor, used caps in the email, saying he did not have to tell me anything about his company, when I asked what was going on, where is my item, what is the tracking number, what is your phone number? Absolutley nothing. Any legite company would give correct, contact information, if anything a tracking number. Emails as the only contact, is bogus. That is not customer service. This mysterious individual claims it's on its way. It's now a week late. And still, NO tracking information. I am not expecting anything grand. I am far from being impressed now. With my luck, it's a piece of crap. Used or not, the service is horrible, will never go through them again."
4,Very interesting perspective,"I was originally required to read this book for a class, but found it interesting anyway :).In any case, I have always been interested in history, and almost majored in it in college, and so found this book particularly interesting. His concept is so simple, and yet so often overlooked. As I understand it, his basic point is that people often think of wars as being caused by factors such as religious differences, economics, etc. Stoessinger argues that these types of factors are necessary but not sufficient. You also need additional factors, particularly misperceptions.I think that he makes a pretty decent case for this, his examples are appropriately chosen, and he makes some very interesting observations. I think many of his ideas have very great explaining power and should be a consideration in any discussion of war.Definitly a recommended read, particularly if you're interested in history or political science."
3,Decent reference,One of those books that's good to have around if you have a laptop or palmtop. Well written and easy to follow.
2,"Good for older kids, but a little too goal driven","The program installed easily and had nice graphics. But I felt the games were too focused upon earning ""points"" and pushed the child to finish one task and go onto the next. Make sure your child has advanced mouse skills because some of the games are quite difficult, even at level 1."
2,Don't get duped!!!,"I purchased this product based on a number of positive reviews I had read. I was looking for an alarm clock that I could use my ipod with and one in which I could dim the backlight. However, after about 7 months, the product was just dead. I thought my power had gone out--but no, everything else but this product was working. I went back to the manufacturer's website and found out that the warranty is only good for 90 days!!! I tried contacting customer service, but got no response. I find it all rather interesting, as if they know they make a product that is defective and takes about six months to break down. Again, skip the frustration and find a different product!"
4,Great C/P value for something at this cost range,"The unit looks great and is very easy to use. Sounds pretty powerful for something this size. I usually listen to a lot of rock, punk, emo and hip hop stuff and Luna Alarm could handle it w/ clear, crisp sounds but lacking a bit on the bass."
2,Good deal but consider the future,"I had ordered this product, as I knew Ducane was a company that made a great product and it was backed by a lifetime warranty on the burners, and the deal was to good to pass up...almost unbelievable. Too Unbelievable, so I did some investigating and found out Ducane filed for bankruptcy in June of 2004. While their lifetime warranty is being prorated and honored by Weber in some cases, I felt parts might be in short supply so cancelled my order."
1,Good Grill BAD SERVICE,"I just purchase the Ducane 7200R LP with cart. The packaging was not very good. Some of the parts within the grill were not secured and so was allowed to move within the grill top. This was not the worst of it. The worst part was the grill cart. The picture and description on the Amazon website claims that it has 2 stainless steel shelves. Do NOT believe it. When it comes to you, you will be getting one stainlesss steel shelf and one with a big cut out with a plastic cutting board. Very cheap looking. Amazon has also decided that they are going to offer different peoples different refunds. They will be offered others $20 and others up to $116. This is unacceptable in my opinion. I will never purchase from Amazon again. They have forgotten the little people."
2,I'm sorry but...,"This is not a well written story. If you are a particular fan of this author and her style I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But for anyone else, the author seems undeveloped. Had I not seen the plug on the front cover that says she's a USA Today bestselling author I would have thought this was her first book. The main charcters are barely developed at all. The most revealing thing we know about them is that Serena, the heroine, is a supposedly beautiful 36 year old virgin. Yeah... The secondary characters are more fleshed out and likeable but still the book comes over as corny and slapstickish. If you need a really, really light read because your waiting to get a route canal at the dentists then sure, have fun reading. But for everyone else it's really not worth picking up."
3,"No one in the film ever heard ""Hey You""?!!!","I understand they couldn't get the rights to a more obscure song they wanted to use, but come on! Having the kid plagiarize ""Hey You"" and we are supposed to believe no one in a New York City audience in the 1980s (save one or two) recognized one of that decade's most famous rock songs! At first I actually thought his saying ""I wrote it"" was some quirky joke the characters didn't take seriously, but they did. You must question the sanity of a director who would go ahead with these related scenes.Aside from that the film was well done if you like overly intellectual self-indulgent characters. Basically a couple of New York PhDs get divorced and the two kids deal with parental stuff and adolescence. The film is all about I, me, mine, as George Harrison would say.Definitely worth seeing and literate articulate dialogue, but you have to ask, ""what's the point?"" as it all becomes an exercise in self-indulgence."
1,"Dysfunction, Inc.","This is a story of a toxic family with 4 dysfunctional people. Nothing thought provoking, just very depressing. Seems like anyone could have written/produced this simple, sadly common family movie."
5,Refreshing,"For a movie that focuses on a pretty overdone plot, it's highly intelligent and well-developed. Sure, it's not a blockbuster film, nor is it the most entertaining movie in the world. Does it necessarily have to be? No. Does it make its point? Yes, very well. I noticed that some reviewers complained about the typical whining, screaming, and bickering between the characters over tiny issues. I don't know what kind of films or life you're living in. Who hasn't gone through a divorce without there being bickering? What kind of family doesn't yell and whine once in awhile? This movie in my opinion is very appealing, intelligent, and refreshing. This is a type of movie for those who want to watch films without all the hype, special affects, big name actors, etc. It's an acquired taste, but at the same time most people would like this film if they gave it a chance."
2,scary,Great acting. Jeff Daniels was awesome. But the movie itself just made me feel like a needed to take a shower. The youngest boy used horrible horrible language and I was totally grossed out at his behavior.
4,Amazing!!!,I loved it! The picture quality is amazing! The dialogue was also really accurate to the television series. There is so much detail put forward in the pictures too! Amazing if you have a thing for action :D
5,Naruto Is Great,"I have to say i was a little uneasy about Naruto when i started reading it in Shonen Jump, my sister told me ""Its about a boy who can turn into a girl"". So i thought why in the world would i want to see that. But after looking over a couple chapters i couldnt really get into it, but it was because i hadnt seen the beginning, so after Naruto finally premiered on Cartoon Network i had no choice but to watch it. I bought volume 1 of the manga the next day. This Manga is really great, i like to read the chapters as they appear on tv. It seems a little slow at first but it always leaves you wanting more. I bought mine a couple weeks before the one with the calendar came out, so i didnt get one. I reccomend getting the one with the calendar!"
3,"The translators here dont know english: ""doppleganger""","... Instead for some reason, Viz falls face forward in what happens to be one of the worst translations ever. ...In trying to ""American-ize"" the manga, they have decided (and this is just one example) Naruto's main move ""Kage Bunshin no Jutsu"" (SHADOW CLONE SKILL) and changed it to ""Art of the Doppleganger""....Is this translation A JOKE?! DOPPLEGANGER...Is that even a word?!I don't even know if this is trying to make this more appealing to American people. ... The volume itself was held back to fix simple grammical errors, and they still have a bunch in the book.For those who wish to read the true Naruto manga find it online. I'm giving this three stars due to the fact I love the Naruto manga and the anime.At least One Piece is okay."
1,beware of pics in cartoons,Teacher at school sent it to the principal because of some of the risque pictures in it (not totally nude but enough younger children are questionable to exposure.) I didn't know much about it before I ordered it for my 10 yr old daughter at her request.
5,The start of a great series,"Naruto Vol. 1 is the start of an awesome series. It's about a boy named Uzumaki Naruto, the class clown and loner of his ninja school but dreams of becoming the greatest ninja of his village. He lives in the Hidden Village of the Leaf where 12 years before a Nine-tailed Fox killed many and was finally captured by the Fourth Hokage (Highest ranked Ninja). What is the connection to this clown and the distructive power of the Nine-tailed Fox? You can only find out if you read the book and I promise you, you won't regret it!Highly addictive and amazing character development as you progress through the series. Do not miss out on this action packed, side splitting comedy of a story about a ninja named Uzumaki Naruto!"
5,"LOVEITLOVEITLOVEITLOVEITLOVEITLOVEIT, etc.","I have to say, this has to be one of the BEST manga I have read!! The story and art is exellent, and it has everything, comedy, action, romance, and drama. I recommend this to everyone, and if you don't like it I suggest you get your head checked."
1,Disappointed,"I love a lot of martial arts movies, however this movie was not what I expected. The movie seem to drag, and at one point I fell asleep. I really did not get the story to this movie, as much as I love martial arts. I was disappointed."
3,Tony Colton is the most wretched singer in the history of British rock.,"No one has greater admiration of Albert Lee's talents than I have. He is quite possibly a more talented guitarist than Eric Clapton. Gavin and Hodges are also fine musicians. Having said that, I cannot listen to a Head, Hands, and Feet album because of the flat and off key warblings of Tony Colton. He is beyond bad. How can anyone listen as he destroys song after song? Albert Lee's vocals are the only saving grace in any of their albums. Tony Colton has a voice only the tone deaf or the extremely deaf can love."
4,Contains his best paragraphs of all time,"His letter about religion to his children is beautiful. It is as classic an attack on it's obsurdity as any shown by Sagan, Edison, Paine, or Mark Twain.And his claiming patriotism and religion as two major problems in the world is prophetic.I love that old man. What a treasure he is."
1,Pathetic,"It's time for Rooney to ride off into the sunset. The longer he stays, the more he shows himself to be a pathetic wanna be. Goodbye Andy and don't let the door hit you in the wallet."
2,Buns on Lips,"I ordered this product because I loved the Sugar Cookie variety. That variety does not have a strong ""cookie"" taste, it was just a great lip gloss. This variety, Cinnamon Buns, tastes like an overly sweet bun - not appealing to have on the lips. Cannot seem to find any more Sugar Cookies. The flavor should not be that strong."
5,ORIGINAL PROGRESSIVE...UNIQUE!,"I found this cd very interesting. I wish the band well, they are quite talented."
2,"Don't Buy ""this"" CD","The music is brilliant. The show is brilliant, but as a rule, never buy any cast recordings from London. The American CD is almost flawless which makes this CD almost disappointing. I was given this CD because the store was out of the OBC. The Ti Moune just doesn't cut it after hearing LaChanze. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad review, i only gave it 2 stars to make sure that no one else makes this mistake and buys this instead of the American albumn which is just about perfect."
1,AWFUL! Broadway Cast is MUCH better,"This is a horrible version of the musical. Don't buy this CD, I really think you'll regret it once you listen to it. Go out and buy the Broadway version."
4,Milan 1964 by Miles Quintet Davis,Great musicians shown truly making music in the moment. However the audio and video could be alot better.
1,Horrible Image Quality!!!,Buyer Beware!!! The image quality of this DVD is so bad that it is almost impossible to watch!!! It looks like a 10th generation copy. It pixilated so badly that it is not viewable!!!
3,"Stills, Nash & Young Save This",The only time David Crosby ever produced anything of any value was when he had other talented artists carrying him. Witness the Byrds or CSN&Y. Stay far away from any of his solo stuff -- it is 100% self indulgent garbage!
4,"Not a book, but a great game!","This is a game that can be used for third grade and up, and employs the use of strategy and flexibility in creating equations using number and operation cubes. Powers and square roots are included but can be avoided for younger players. Used by the Gifted Council at their competitions, it is a terrific game, but it takes time to learn."
2,"I'm not sure whose skin this primer is made for, but it is not made for mine","After all the great reviews, I made this purchase. This is not a good product for my skin. It does absolutely nothing for me other than make me looked like I have caked on, uneven make-up on my face. My pores look even larger and noticeable then without it and the color is not good for my complexion. Can not say anything good about it, but again, maybe it is just not good for my skin."
3,not bad,"well, it did not have much effect as said in website. May be the product is good for some skin."
5,"perfect in every way! and great ""makeup"" for young ladies!","i have used this either alone or as a primer for over a year now. i am blessed with great skin, so this and some mascara and im on my way. it really evens out skin tone, within minutes its like a miracle has happened! also, my 11 year old has been bugging me to wear makeup. so i gladly handed her my tube of this. not only is this better for her skin than any other drug store brand, it also has spf. she feels ""cool"", and i dont feel bad about letting her wear ""makeup"", :)"
1,Deceptive Picture,"What I received is not what was pictured in the advertizement. What I got was bag of multicolored chicken feathers, which looked nothing like eagle feathers. What I received worked for my purpose, but was not what I ordered."
3,somehow better than local glues,It was ok. I had high expectation from this product. This turned out to be better than the local glues which i can find at CVS/Walgreens.
2,Waste of money,"Highly concentrated chemical smell, definitely gets rid of odors but DOES NOT smell like a new car!"
3,Very cute and comfortable,"This outfit is very sexy (boyfriend) and very comfortable (me!). The stethescope arrived with one piece unconnected, and that piece refused to stay in place (some glue might have fixed that, but I didn't make the effort). Another drawback, though, is that the seller priced the smaller size $10 higher than the other sizes. It is good quality and was shipped promptly."
4,A great debut for her solo gospel career . . .,"First, let me say that I really enjoy this CD and it really speaks to my spirit. The songs combine the urban beats that most young people like myself want to hear. At the same time, though, it provides a positive, uplifting message. However, the reason I can only give it 4 stars is because I often found Michelle's voice to be lacking. I agree with the reviewer who said that she sounds like a 10 year-old who hasn't grown into her voice yet. (Actually, it reminds me more of The Chipmunks.) On some tracks, you can literally hear her voice crack! (""Heard A Word"") However, given how powerfully she sings on other songs (""Everything"" - a fantastic track!), I think that this may have been done on purpose. Though it was a little disconcerting at first, ultimately it works. The CD has a really cool, Jill Scott vibe going. Overall, I find it really enjoyable and I hope to see more from Ms. Williams! God bless!"
3,Gospel music,"I love gospel music, but this album disappointed me. Her voice is okay, but when I want to hear some sangin' she does absolutely nothing for me. She has a sweet voice, and the songs are okay. I just couldn't really connect with her as being real."
4,not bad she's doing the damn thing,this cd is'nt bad at all and very good if you like this sort of gospel.
2,A disappointment,"I'm sorry, but while this album is nicely done. The problem is her voice. She sounds worst than Ashanti. I respect her for doing gospel music, but she needs to hope and pray that Destiny's Child never breaks up because this album reveals that she is only a background singer and not a lead singer. Now I understand why Beyonce never gave her any songs to lead on. Despite her weak voice, the words and music are touching and inspiring. She deserves alot of credit for that because she wrote and produce alot of the tracks. If you like gospel music with a temporary appeal and can get pass her voice, then you will enjoy this album."
1,Farberware Pro Forged 8-Piece Cutlery Block Set,"My husband and I bought this cutlery block in the month of Jan-2004 and to our shock the knives which were available in the grocery store are much better than this, I feel a brand like farberware should have done much better job than this, also I am using just the bread knife for cutting everything also the scissors is good.You can trash all of the knives and may me hang on to the wodden block to decorate other knives with the block.I spent so much on the Cutlery Block Set that I am using only bread knife . please don't buy this."
4,A foundation for learning Ethiopian history,"I found the book well-written and well-organized according to significant changes in Ethiopia's development. Economics, as well as politics, ethnology and technology are used to explain events and their significance. One thing that did annoy me is the fact that historic maps are all located together in the back, rather than in the sections in which they are relevent. The use of some of the Ethiopian titles of nobility is also confusing, when European equivalents would have done just as well.Not a casual read by any means, but a serious student of African history could do much worse than Marcus' book."
5,great,"Questo Live è eccezionale! Deris è in grandissima forma, al top con gli Helloween dal vivo! La band inoltre intrattiene l'audience con un sacco di scene divertenti. Questo doppio dvd contiene tante Interviste, RoadMovie ed i videoclip degli ultimi singoli. Questa la scaletta:Disc1: 1.Intro 2.King For A 1000 Years 3.Eagle Fly Free 4.Hell Was Made In Heaven 5.Keeper Of The 7 Keys 6.A Tale That Wasn't Right 7.Drum Solo 8.Mr.Torture 9.If I Could Fly 10.Guitar Solo 11.Power 12.Future World 13.The Invisible Man 14.Mrs.God 15.I Want Out 16.Dr.Stein 17.OutroDisc2: -Occasion Avenue -Halloween -Extra"
4,"Great performance, the band at its best!","This is the first time I see Helloween performing live: From other world! Brilliant! Outrageous!Andi great voice, Sascha & Michael what can I say? Excellent! Markus & Dani pacing the show. On the other hand, the audience totally involved, the classics included, what else do you want?Drawbacks:The subtitles don't work on the second CD for the interviews and stuff, on any language. By the way, I couldn't understand why these guys do not speak english with so many years in this business. :("
5,One of my favorite albums,"What can I say, but fantastic! Pale Unkempt Hours of Late Grey Afternoons and Goethe Park, are two of my favorite pieces Kevin Keller has written to date. Rachel Amov's violin just sings..."
1,SCAM!,"DO NOT BUY THE TRUE CERAMIC PRO! It is not truely ceramic! Mine broke after only 9 months, which is probably why it only has a six month warrabty. The first iron they sent me stopped working after two days, and the second they sent to me had chipped plates, and the third stopped working after only 9 months and the painted on plate coating chipped off VERY quickly to reveal METAL plates, NOT CERAMIC! I regret buying mine, it was not worth the money. The quality does not match the expensive price. This item should be priced at $1.00 for its quality. SCAM!"
1,Had no disc error within 9 mths and Toshiba US will not replace,"Take care, any Toshiba DVD player that plays all regions will not be replaced by Toshiba even if it goes wrong within a year as ours did. It had a common fault in which it says there is no disc. Toshiba have replaced the machines that this has occured in that only play Region 1 but after much delay decided they couldn't replace mine as it played all regions. Toshiba will not handle any machines other than Region 1 and will tell you to contact the supplier for a replacement."
5,German Artillery of World War One by Herbert Jager,An excellent book! Herr Jager fills in an important area missing in the field of Artillery. His work on the known and many lesser known and rare pieces of Germany Artillery before and during WWI does justice on the subject that should please almost everone even Ian Hogg. He has included many rare photos of field guns and other equipment that I have never seen in books in the United States. The book has descriptions of each piece and almost all pieces of artillery described has at least one photo to accompany it. The book is easy to read and follow and should be included in anyone's collection on Artillery. The only mistake I found was the misidentification of one photo on page 205 which should read 15cm Kanon 16 by Krupp. If you are interested in Artillery then this is a must have book for your collection.
1,Disappointing,"This is not what it appeared to be. Mega Bloks are large and easy for toddlers. This bucket is full of smaller pegged, harder to use pieces. I felt very misled and I feel I wasted my money."
5,This is Mario Vargas Llosa's first novel...,"This is Mario Vargas Llosa's first novel, and is included in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" published by America Reads Spanish, a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US. The reviewer in the guide shares, ""I was fifteen years old when I read The City and the Dogs, Vargas Llosa's first novel. It was my first encounter with great literature and I was dazzled. Silently following the jaguar, the slave and Alberto, I discovered a new and fascinating world, and I decided that I wanted to be a reader."""
4,SlingboxPro Review,"It was easy to set up and works great on a desktop, laptop or pocketPC. I have tried it on all three! As long as you don't have a low bandwidth cap from your IP provider this will work great, streaming takes a lot of bandwidth. I also wish it could stream directly through my home network from the slingbox direct to the pc without having to go onto the internet, if it did this it would not use bandwidth. That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. You can connect almost any electronic device to it, I got the HD connect cable also, this has an extra 4 ir remotes adding to the 2 ir provided by the box itself, you now have control of 6 devices through ir.Just an update of my review. I've had the Slingbox for a while now, and it will go directly through my network to my home pc, I've upgraded it to 5 stars."
4,"Slingbox, ideal for travelers","I am throughly enjoying my Slingbox Pro. Installation was easy and connected to my Tivo with out incident. I did have a bit of delay with getting the audio to work but that was due to selecting the correct audio ports on the Tivo. Video quality is very good with either my DSL at the office or my wireless card while on the road. Sound is below average and needs some work - perhaps a firmware upgrade will take care of that.I travel for business and it is wonderful to watch my own local news instead of the news where I am visiting. I can also keep up with my financial programs on my schedule by recording them on the Tivo and playing them back through the Slingbox pro, even if I'm in a different time zone.All in all, while perhaps a bit extravagant, the Slingbox is a great addition to my road warrior tool box.TP"
3,"It works but not that great, HD is somewhat of a joke.","I bought this with the HD kit planning on watching HD content on my 24"" samsung monitor, what a joke that was. Not only was the feed somewhat choppy, it was tinny. I called support and they informed me that the HD connections were only there to connect to. They can't stream HD so basically you have to pay $50 just for cables. It was definitally easy to set up, but other than that, this thing has a long way to go in my opinion. I was streaming on a home network I tested it remote but what is the point if I have to be at home for it to work?"
3,3 for now...,"I've had this a month. I'm a fairly technical guy working in the IT industry... So I was fairly confident going into this that I'd be able to set it up. It was a lot tricky than I expected and I'm not 100% sure I even have it set up correctly but it functions. Quality and the software is excellent, the channel changer works nicely but I'm concerned that i'm going to have to go through another painful install when I replace my existing computer.I'm also a little confused by the HD Connect Cable - I'm a little perturbed it wasn't included and feel that some of the marketing literature on the PRO isn't 100% accurate in terms of HD support. But I suppose that's part of the enjoyment with new technology :)"
1,"worked, but then would not change channels. Waste.","Worked great at first, but later I could only view the channel that was last on the cable box. Kind of useless at that point. A fun toy that was not ready for release. There are enough people here with obvious defects that manufacturer should have offered to fix, but that did not happen. Would not buy this or its newer versions."
4,This thing is awesome...once you get it set up.,"The only reason the slingbox pro gets 4 stars instead of 5 was because I had problems setting it up initially. Actually, the problem was not with the slingbox itself, but in setting up port forwarding on my router (verizon dsl). The star is lost because slingmedia(the makers of slingbox) did not provide adequate directions on how to set up my router manually and I had to go trolling on the internet for the directions. I eventually figured it out, and now it works great. I have been using the slingbox remotely for a few weeks now and I absolutely love it. I can watch football games from my home town while I am away that I normally wouldn't be able to get. The quality of the video is great, even with my portable internet connection (wireless broadband) that isn't the fastest (400-600kbs). I love it, and am glad I bought it."
3,"Almost Delivers,Not BAD","I live overseas and miss certain broadcasts like Sports and TV serials not available where I live.I can get linked on Slingbox with no problem but when streaming at 330-360bps and trying to show on a screen the size of a 32"" monitor,the picture is unacceptable(fuzzy,distorted and wavy).If Slingbox can rectify this one,it is well worth the investment.Overall,I am satisfied with the delivery on a PC but am not thrilled with the picture quality on a TV screen."
2,Slingbox Can't Record & May Require Wireless Bridge,"Great Idea, but bad follow through. I just purchased the Slingbox Pro only to learn that 6 monhs ago Slingbox altered its software to prevent the owner user from being able to record. This is a huge drawback as I was hoping to replace my tivo with the device by having my favorite tv shows streamed to my computer and downloaded for later viewing. Can't do that Anymore! You can only stream the content from one location to the other for immediate viewing. If you are streaming content from London to view in California, I am afraid the time delay makes this product useless. One other drawback is that if your tv or dvd recorder is located a fair distance from your wireless network, you will also need to purchase a wireless bridge which will set you back about $90. Overall this was a bad purchase."
1,Defective product,I purchased this product and had so many problems with it and eventually SlingMedia tech support came to the conclusion that the product was defective.
4,Nice piece of technology!!,"I really like what this Slingbox does for my life. I work a boring all-day job at the computer, and to be able to view some programming from my home cable box is awesome to say the least. I bought this for my dad who lives overseas, so he can view programming from home here in the states. So far so good. It seems to be working great. The picture quality is good and so is the audio. I can't wait till it is even better, so that the images can be viewed a little larger. What I mean is on ""Remote Viewing"" the smaller the screen one uses the better the quality. Overall, if you want towatch TV on our laptop, work computer, or anywhere you can connect to the net this is an awesome product. Highly recommended!!"
5,"And now, a word from our sponsor...","Simply put, this package offers the most bang for the buck. Yes, many have stated the picture and sound quality is not great at times, but I dare you to find more content for the price! Lets hope the folks at Madacy release another volume of Classic Commercials for us to enjoy!"
3,Bartok Piano Concerto CD,"The CD was excellent, delivered promptly and as advertised.I personally did not care for the Bartok work which had been recommendedto me, but with which I was previously unfamiliar."
5,Warning: Don't Read This Book in Public!,"MOVE OVER, GIRL is one of the funniest books that I've ever read! It will make you laugh out loud in public. A wonderful debut! I loved the language, the college-memories, etc., It was nice to feel the main characters growth... and depth. Didn't like his ""final choice""... but it was so-like what we tend to do, sometimes... Good Work, Mr. Petersen. A Thought-provoking and downright hilarious reading experience!"
2,Not for Large Floatation Devices,"I purchased this air pump to fill up a large pool lounger by the same manufacturer. Upon opening the box, I was dismayed at how light and flimsy it appeared to be, but I decided to give it a chance. I spent an hour attempting to fill just one of the three air chambers on the lounger, but finally gave up. I imagine that this product would be fine for smaller items like beach balls or inner tube floaters. I immediately ordered a larger air pump and am hoping that it will be able to do the job."
5,"I LOVE YOU, BRYN!","Terfel is amazing. The voice is warm, wide and sensous, and the acting is top-notch. This recital is the best recording I have heard of him outside full operas, where he is (of course) at his best. Every peice on it is a gem, but especially the first five Mozart arias. You will never hear a better Catologue Aria. I make it a point to listen to his at least once a week.If you are an opera lover and (God forbid!) have not yet stumbled upon Terfel, this is an excellent introduction. And by the way, you needn't be a singer to appreciate his voice - I know very little of the technicalities of singing (about as much as a year in the church choir can give you), but I play the violin and we violinists are very keen on singers who know what they are doing. In the words of my violin teacher, Terfel is ""charming!"""
3,Great Price but not confortable,"I was looking for affordable headphones. Something cheap that would deliver quality sound, while still sticking to my ear. Well, this fit the bill pretty well. The shipping came at the second to last day of arrival, which oh well, is the evil of buying stuff online. The only issue with this set of headphones is that the actual earpiece is a bit too big for my ears, so it sits there uncomfortably. But compared to Ink'd by Skullcandy, it delivers better sound.Pro:Good priceSounds GreatCons:Sits uncomfortably (compared to Ink'd)"
3,eye cream,"I recommend not wasting your money on this one it didn't help, and it is such a small container for the amount of money. I love oil of olay but not this one."
5,Love Olay Regenerist!,"I've been using Olay for years and regenerist for the last few yrs; I am now 48 and look 10 years younger. I also don't tan which probably contributes, but I've started using the regenerist spf lotion on my hands and what a huge difference it has made! My hands were looking my 48 yrs but after a week or so using the regenerist they look so much younger now. Will always use Olay products and regenerist is perfect!"
3,Decent Cream But...,Horrible bottle design. I used it for 4 days before the pump mechanism stopped working.
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,"SO, I must first say I typically LOVE Regenerist products. I absolutely can't live without Regenerist night cream. I had such high hopes for the eye serum.I used it the day I received it - application was nice. The product was easily absorbed, and there was no noticable fragrance. However, it wasn't as moisturizing as I'd hoped. However, I woke up in the morning with my eyelids all swelled up and red, and the skin felt so raw. My eyes stung like crazy too. Figuring it had to be seasonal allergies, and not the eye serum, I continued to use it another 2 times. Finally, there was just no way to pretend that it wasn't the eye serum. The skin under my eye looked like crepe paper - all dried out and wrinkled. I'm 27 - I didn't have those wrinkles to start with! I went back to my old eye cream, and the skin smoothed back out after a few days and finally isn't raw and sore anymore."
5,Made a noticeable difference,I was beginning to get lines at the outside corners of my eyes. Routine use of this product has made them much less noticeable.
1,NOT HYPOALLERGENIC.,No where on the label or box is this product listed as hypoallergenic. Many can expect allergic reactions. Look for a product that is hypoallergenic if you know you are sensitive; that your eyes become irritated easily.
3,"I prefer the ProX Eye Cream, though this one felt very smooth","* I prefer the ProX Eye Cream, though this one felt very smooth* It did not do much for wrinkles that I could tell"
4,Long time user,I tried product after product until I found this one. I buy it on Amazon to save money -- it's $22 at Target and grocery stores. I've been buying it consistently for 5 years and would be at a major loss if it were ever discontinued. I wish they sold larger bottles though. Each bottle lasts me 3-4 weeks of daily use (in the mornings usually.)
3,eye serum,"Web MD recommends the Olay Regenerist line so I tried it. This product is easy to apply but, so far after a few weeks, I have no results. I also did not like the small pump bottle. I couldn't get it to work a few times. Maybe a tube would be better."
5,Good product!,"I've used this and other products as my daily regiment for the past couple of years.It is effective, yet inexpensive."
1,False view of the history,"This book has one very important error. It claims that the people who abducted Mrs. Stone were ethnic Bulgarians, which is not true. Bulgarians never lived on this part of the Balkan peninsula. Those people were Macedonians, as thay claimed themselves. This book is part of the Bulgarian propaganda to deny anything Macedonian (nation, language, culture). The other facts in the book are mostly correct."
4,Quite a feat!,"It's amazing to think that Stevens was able to complete such a journey over 100 years ago on such a beastly bike. With no gears and bad roads, it seems he had to walk (or trundle) his bike as much as he rode it. It is especially interesting to see just how different some parts of the world are now, and yet just how little other parts of the word have changed since his journey. More than a travel book or bicycle adventure, the book is an interesting time capsule from long ago that is a pleasure to read!"
3,Beethoven:Symphony Nos. 5 & &/ Kleiber,"The Symphony no. 5 is the best performance that I have ever heard. There have been so many performances since the first recording of Nikish like Weingartner, Toscanini and Furtwangler. But, for the C-minor symphony, I think this is the best for the new milenium, also. But I regret to note that no.7 (which is usually combined in one CD with no.5), the 'Balance of Speed' is not so good as expected. The third movement (Presto) might be exaggerated like others.(please listen to Toscanini, Furtwanger, Bohm and others) In that case this CD shall be 6 STAR RATED."
5,KLEIBER ODER NICHT ?,"Kleiber ist Kleiber.Les deux commentaires précédents résument le programme : du costaud bien emballé.Le ""Pom pom pom pom"" de la 5 est grave et contient ce qu'il faut de violence ; le rythme anapestique du deuxième mouvement de la 7 illustre bien le tourbillonnement toujours renouvelé qui en résulte.Les qualités d'enregistrement et l'édition en SACD est une brillante parure pour cette interprétation mythique.Kleiber macht frei !"
5,Fast efficient service,I would order from this store again. Fast efficient service. What you look for online.
3,Warning to audiophiles: it's 96/24 PCM,"While the 5:1 SACD sound is better than any CD, it is only incrementally better. After noticing the lack of ""breath"" and ""space"" in the sound, a staleness in the strings. I checked the liner notes, and sure enough, the sound passed through a 96KHz, 24 bit pulse code modulation (PCM) bottleneck during remastering. I buy SACDs for one reason: to get DSD sound, and frankly, I feel ripped off again. Numerous other SACD/DSD discs are 96/24PCM, and sound like hell --- the Lindsay Beethoven op. 130, Hillary Hahn's SACDs, Alison Krauss, Mozart with Manze. Philips and Sony had better change their licensing of the DSD/SACD mark to stop the brand dilution by PCM mastering. You want to hear real DSD sound? Get Mozart's Requiem with Harnoncourt, or Mozart with Midori. Once you've heard real DSD, you can spot 96/24 PCM every time. I won't buy SACDs anymore unless I can verify they are PCM-free."
5,A one horse race,"Carlos Kleiber made the Beethoven 5th and 7th symphonies a one horse race for all the myriad of recordings that have been done by various conductors and orchestras. This is, by far, the best of this duo you are likely to get.Oh, you are a collector and you say you already have nine recordings of the 5th already? Well, you surely need one more... THIS ONE! GET IT!"
1,Dishonest scholarship,"The author is not honest when presenting the plightof Egyptian Jews. He belittles their suffering.In fact, he omits the most serious calamity thatbefell Egyptian Jewry: Incarceration and torturein the detentioncamps of Abu Zaabal and Tura between 1967-70.It is indeed dishonest scholarship, because theauthor covers the period before and after 1967-70,but not these three years. It seems that he isinterested in blaming Israel for the fate ofEgyptian Jewry, which is unfair. Israel welcomedEgyptian Jews after Egypt denied them citizizenship inin 1929 and employment in 1947 (The Company Law)."
1,Author unfair to Egyptian Jews,"I agree with those who condemn the book. I think Jews suffered in Egypt a lot more than what the Professor wants the reader to believe. For example, one of my Jewish classmates in Egypt, his 2 brothers, and his father were arrested and jailed for 3 years. They were beaten and tortured. These arrests happened to all Jews who stayed in Egypt in 1967. I believe the author is unjust here.Also, the author does not seem to appreciate the devastation effect of two laws on the fate of the Egyptian Jewish community: The Nationality Law and the Company Law. These laws denied citizenship and employment to 90% of Jews, and as a result, many of them left. These laws caused the flight of Jews much more than the wars with Israel."
1,Ardent Cook sez choose any other than this oven!!!,"Simply: Rotisserie unusable unless its 1 lb squab super trussed, dont even try a small chicken. Broiler pan cannot be used with rack and support slots allow for the shallow pan to tilt and spill fat and can cause GREASE FIRES! Heat elements are marginal compared to MANY delongis I have owned. There is a reason why this model is on sale. Designer should be forced to cook with what they hath wrought as punishment. Winner of the Dante's Convection Oven Contest."
3,Typical flimsy China made product,"Typical flimsy China made productI originally bought my old DeLonghi Toaster oven because it was a high quality sturdy Italian made product, it actually lasted 20 years!I can't imagine this cheesy built unit will last half that long. I put it in the same category as a $50.00 Black and Decker. It works fine, as it is new.The oven lacks an ""on"" switch. You have to use the timer which cumbersome to someone that knows how to look at something and know it is done.It doesn't have a ""toast"" function and the picture of the Pizza on the box is downright fraudulent... unless you know of a place that sells 10""X11"" oval Pizzas.I am not giving this product the lowest rating because it does work at this time, but it is far from the DeLonghi products I grew to trust. I feel betrayed. I believe my next will be a different brand."
2,Voice on the Radio,"This is third book in the ""Face on the Milk Carton"" series. Janie's boyfriend, Reeve, has left for college while Janie is slowly coming to terms with both sets of her parents. When Reeve begins working at the college radio station, he finds himself telling Janie's story. Immediately he feels guilty, but he continues to share her story night after night on the radio. I thought that this book was a bit of a let-down. I do not like the way the characters have developed. Reeve comes across as a jerk, while Janie appears to be a whiny brat."
3,A review for The Voice on the Radio.,This book is such an amasing novel that can just take your breath away. In my opinion this book is great because Jannie the main character has so much going through her life. When Reeve heads off to collage Jannie discovers a dieing secret that Reeve has been up to in collage. I would reccomend this book to young adults because this book is in a series about a teenager and her life of being kiddnaped 13 years back. This book deserves 3 out of 5 stars because the plot of this story can just take the breath out of you like this could really happen in reality.
2,this book was interesting but not meaningful,"I think that the Voice on the Radio was very interesting. It was missing the ""umf"" that really graps the reader leaving them wanting them to read more. It was somewhat bland and I was disappointed about Cooney's writing performance comared to that of The Face on the Milk Carton and Whatever Happened to Janie. The book expressed just the facts and was ""feeelingless"". I hope that Cooney can redeem herself by writing another and final epic about Janie Johnston and her awful teen years."
2,In The Middle,In the beginning of the book it was very confusing. I think the author needs to be clearer about what's going on with the characters. Too many characters get introduced all at once and I couldn't keep track of what was going on with each one. Towards the middle of the book I understood it better and everything began to make sense. Any parents who are thinking about reading this book shouldn't bother because adults wouldn't be interested in the events involved in the plot. I wasn't interested in the book at all but my thirteen-year-old son seemed to like it; but he had said it wasn't one of the best. The reason this book is poor is because a lot of the character traits about Hannah were unknown and I didn't get to know any of the characters and what some of them were feeling when certain events had happened to them. The beginning doesn't flow with the ending of the story. I felt it wasn't worth my time but if your really into mystery then give it a try!
2,Aww...why?,I love nutribiotic products but this one and the allergy spray as well did not help my sinuses but to aggravate them really bad. I'm not clear as to why this happened because I have used the GSE drops in my saline rinse with no problems. There is something in the sprays irritating the membranes and making me swell. I'm so bummed because I've a drawer full of nasal sprays that just do not work. It could be a sensitivity I have to whatever all nasal sprays have in common and I'm not sure what that would be.If you have used nasal sprays with little or no problem then go ahead and use but if you have had issues with numerous other sprays then I suggest to stick to nasal irrigation or neti rinse. Sorry I had to leave negative feedback but the product was very harsh to my poor nose.
5,Amazing Nasal Spray,I've been using this product for years. It does a great job of opening up nasal passages and letting you breath again. Completely recommend.
4,Comfort in Blue,"I needed a pair of blue sandals. I have a black pair similar to these, but these are the best. They are so very comfortable. They surround my foot. Excellent shoe. Not dressy looking at all, though. Only bad part is the toe covering is a bit large."
5,Excellent!,"My fridge developed a horrible odor over the summer. We took everything out of it, food, shelves, EVERYTHING and cleaned and sanitized it all, but the smell wouldn't go away. I searched and found a ton of these air purifiers, but most were very expensive. I figured for $12.00 I would give this a try. I got the product in the mail, popped in the batteries and put it in the stinky fridge. The next morning when I opened the fridge to grab cream for my coffee, the odor was gone! Not just a little better, but completely gone. I kept this in the fridge and the odor hasn't returned."
3,Not expecting this!,The program has ok potential. But I have to research my own practice ideas to fit into the planner. The planner lacked ideas or plans and that was frustrating. I ended up having to typing in all the plans mannually and I don't have time for that. I guess I was just disappointed that the program didn't reduce my planning time at all.
4,My Swiss Knife Jacket,"I bought this Vest in substitution of another one. Great, I'm very satisfied. Five star for the price!"
4,Photo Vest,"Purchased this vest for an up coming trip where I think it will be easier to use than carrying camera bag....It appears to be very usable with lots of pockets and places to stow ""stuff"". I'm a size medium on most shirts and jackets and found that this runs a little on the small side. Still fits but certainly isn't ""loose""...I'm thinking I wish I'd have had one a long time ago...."
5,Fascinating! Not your typical animated kiddie fare,"This film was produced by the wonderful Rankin/Bass team - best known for their holiday masterpieces ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Frosty the Snowman"" and ""Mad Monster Party"", just to name a few. The wraparound story (which is live-action) deals with a young Hans Christian Anderson struggling to find The Garden of Paradise. On his journey, we are treated to four haunting stories, each filmed in Rankin/Bass's trademark stop-motion ""Animagic"". The stories are unusual in that they all end on a low note rather than a typical ""Disney happy ending"" - keeping true to Anderson's original tales. Included here are ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ""Thumbelina"" and ""The Garden of Paradise"". Once again Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass have created a fantasyland of wonder and imagination filled to the brim with beautiful tunes."
4,"Great hat, awful seller and very misleading product description","This is indeed a very cool LED hat! The hat itself is of good quality but of course what makes a conversation piece is the hands-free lighting aspect: several LEDs, several settings. I wonder how long will the batteries last, we'll see. The battery box, contrary to my initial belief, doesn't bother me at all.The seller (Thememstore) was not so hot (one less star). First, as the description clearly specified a 6-pack, I expected 6 hats, but only 1 arrived. Upon contacting the seller, first they totally justified the misleadign error as ""inventory verbiage"" and didn't even hint of correcting it and then later acussed me of lack of common sense (shame on you, they even said). Sure, the hat is nice and worth the 1-unit price, but I was expecting 6 not-so-hot chinese hats. Anyway, thir handling of the whole situation was what really bothered me and I expressed it so in the seller review. So, beware: You're only getting 1 hat."
5,great in black-outs,"Someone handed me this hat during a black-out. I was the ""chief cook"" in a very dark kitchen. The hat gave me both hands to use for stirring pots (love the gas stove!), chopping onions, checking the biscuits in the oven.Thank you Panther Vision."
2,Poor Tuning in the Mass in E minor,"I think that Jochum's interpretation is excellent in this recording but I take issue with the performance of the chorus in the E minor Mass. The sopranos often reach for the high notes and come out under the pitch...regularly. Anything above a C# is a bit of an adventure for them. The chorus, as a whole loses pitch in unaccompanied sections. It is difficult to listen to this disc. I wish I had purchased the recording on the Hyperion label."
1,Save your money,I've been a wrench head for over 35 Years. I've used lot's of Chilton Manuals and books. This is by far the worst I've ever seen. I bought it to help with the restoration of an '86 Lincoln Mark VII LSC. It had virtually no information on the shift cable R&R. It has limited information on interior parts and the diagrams are so small I need a magnifying glass to see them. I would never have bought it if I had known what it lacks. Maybe that's why they seal them in plastic bags on the shelf now ????
4,Surprisingly tasty,"I was very impressed with the vanilla taste of this product; not fake at all. In fact, blended into a smoothie with a banana, soymilk, and some cinnamon, it was actually tasty. Sure, it was a little bit sandy - like all protein powders - but it was more than palatable. I definitely recommend this product."
3,Haven't used this much yet.............,".............but I suspect the cogs are well-made, I know they are well-designed, and I think they will work very well."
2,"Attractive, but .......","This thing didn't last a month. The key pad was bad in it. The price was great and I really liked the way it looked. Too bad, huh.I wouldn't buy it again."
3,Pretty good gadget,"The only flaws are that it can only cut the sections the same size no matter if you are cutting a small or large grapefruit. It's also very sharp and the blade cover doesn't stay on real well. So, put it somewhere that you know your kids won't accidentally come across it. Other that that it works pretty good."
4,Good,"The product works well. Not sure how it will hold up over time, but seems like it should last a few years. It is very unique. More pictures of how it works online would be valuable for future buyers."
5,Great Gadget!!!,"I purchased a Grapefruiter two weeks ago and just ordered another one so that I can have one at home and at work. I absolutely LOVE this product. I would normally stray from grapefruit because it is not the easiest fruit to eat, however, now I eat it everyday. Definitely a handy little gadget."
1,Disappointing performance,"I'm very disappointed in the actual performance of this product, especially after reading so many positive reviews. I find it wastes a lot of grapefruit, it doesn't cut well so it takes too much work to get out a single piece, and it makes quite a juicy mess. Bummer! I'm going back to peeling and sectioning by hand since it's faster and I get more fruit."
4,"Purchased this lens for my son for Christmas. Unfortunately, it was the wrong lens for his camera.",Needed to return the item because it was the wrong lens. The order process went well and the return of the item went was easy. I
5,Timeless Enjoyment,"I purchased Bahama Pajamas, Deep In The Jungle, Late Last Night, and Traffic Jams 12 years ago on cassette for my daughters when they were babies. I have now bought them on CD for my nephews. They are again being enjoyed."
5,Must have,"Bohm & the Vienna worked so well together. The Beethoven is perfect & the Scubert is not far behind. Now DG needs to go & re-master & issue the whole Beethoven Symphony cycle (not the digital 9th, which was a disaster recording & performance wise although Bohm sounded like he was failing healthwise by that time as well)."
5,ANCHOR BAY provides an EXCELLENT print!,"In the past, this film has been released from a very poor 16 mm transfer....finally, the 35mm becomes available. It will be like seeing the film for the first time. In a cel animated feature especially, you need to see it in vivid color and the 16mm print wasn't cutting it. There is some GREAT music in this 1966 RANKIN/BASS film too! AND surprisingly, it wasn't provided by MAURY LAWS (Who was busy with another project)...it was provided by GEORGE WILKINS. Once again, JULES BASS wrote the lyrics and Directed the film. Another RARELY seen film that involves RANKIN/BASS artist PAUL COKER, JR. for the first time! Glad to see this one restored for all to enjoy!"
1,Terrible,Did not fit well. My foot slid to far forward and it really tore up my my foot where the piece goes between your toes.
3,"Beware, check further also...","Only three stars, not to belittle this obviously loved and excellent recording. I HIGHLY recommend that you also check out other great recordings as the differences are enormous. The great Reiner CSO version from the fifties has been in my head for 40 plus years. Upon hearing the Kubelik version I was shocked at the great difference in tempo. The Kubelik is MUCH slower than the Reiner! Seriously, the first minute of the Kubelik is covered in 40 seconds of the Reiner. I am no music professor and I am not trying to say what is superior, ultimately it is a question of taste and preference, (and probably a little bias in my case) but with this level of variety in performances, please check out the other major recordings available of this great work."
4,AUGUSTEN BURROWS FUNNY,I REALLY ENJOY AUGUSTEN BURROWS...I ADMIT IT IS NOT FOR EVERYONE BUT I FIND HIM FUNNY. THIS WAS ON THE SAME FUNNY METER AS HIS OTHER WORKS. THE ONLY ONE I THOUGHT WAS KIND OF BORING WAS SELLEVISION..THIS ONE I REALLY ENJOYED :D
3,Hopefully He's Not Slipping Already,"While there are still the stories that make you cringe, cry and laugh at the same time, we're now also subjected to his ""horror"" stories of success: sweating while at book signings; famous-author-recognized-on-airplane-with-bloody-nose; Bad accommodations while on speaking tours. We should all have such problems. On top of this, the book is by-and-large written in fragmented sentences..where was the editor on this one?I LOVE Augusten..but what made him original was his perspective on the pre-success stuff. You'll love those parts; the rest you can skip."
2,David Sedaris Lite with a splash of bitters.,"Burroughs is a funny observationist with a snarky view of the world that is filtered through a pretty odd background (as anyone familiar with RUNNING WITH SCISSORS might know).Though I find his humorous take on things entertaining about 98% of the time, sometimes his style gets a bit tiresome. If he were a cocktail, I'd call him David Sedaris lite with a splash of bitters."
3,Decent but not great,"This is the first Augusten Burroughs book I read, and I can't say I'm terribly smitten by his writing. While there are some hysterically funny stories here, few seem particularly insightful or memorable. More curious to me is that he doesn't seem a particularly skilled wordsmith. He kind of just strings sentences together without any unusual panache or natural flow. It's enjoyable and lightweight reading that will work well on a plane, but I doubt I'll be reading anything else by him."
1,boring stories,"I have read all of Mr. Burroughs' books, and have enjoyed them. That is, until I sat down to read this book of short tales. I found little of interest to keep my attention, and after 4 or 5 stories, put it aside."
1,I Didn't Laugh Once,"I Didn't Laugh Once - not once! As others have said, I couldn't get through the first 4 stories. All I kept thinking was, ""This guy wishes he was, and is trying to be, David Sedaris."" He is NOT David Sedaris or Amy for that matter, and I'm huge fans of both."
3,"always funny, always entertaining","I give this book a 3 and 1/2. I love love love Augusten Burroughs and have read all of his nonfiction books up to this point, but this is not his best.I think the author is running out of highly entertaining stories, which is not surprising considering this is his fourth autobiographical book. Don't read this book - or any of his books - if you are easily offended. I happen to find him hilarious, very candid, and extremely observant. Though I often find myself wondering how Burroughs can remember so much detail from so long ago.There are definitely stories in this book that are better than others, but they are all still entertaining. I promise, you WILL laugh out loud."
2,Nothing wrong with waiting for paperback,"No need to rush out and buy this one. Burroughs is Running on Empty with these stories that don't measure up to his previous work. There is little that can be said for the organization of the entire book, much less the individual chapters themselves.Nevertheless, there are moments where you will be tempted to laugh out loud. I'm a big fan, but this effort was a disappointment. I would recommend the NYTimes review, which says it all better than me."
3,It was OK but not great!,There's a LOT of fluff to go through before you get to the humor. I wasn't expecting to be laughing the entire time but I don't appreciate digging through a mountain of cow dung to find a quarter!
5,"Great book, seriously","Seriously, this is a book that you just want to tell everyone about. You will laugh out loud multiple times throughout it. I think it's a book that everyone should read honestly. When someone asks me, ""What are some good books to checks out?"" This is always a first on my list. I've read all of Augusten's work, and although I enjoy every book of his, this is by far my favorite from him."
2,Impractical for anyone who doesn't cook outdoors - smoke!,Barbara Kafka's brave attempt to simplify cooking fails for the most part because of the smoke and debri produced by her recipes. A magnificent failure.
5,WONDERFUL,I have purchased this recipe book 3 different times. I introduced this to my friends and family and they love it as much as I. Always in great condition and well worth the money. 5 stars!
3,You had better have a self-cleaning oven,"Don't buy this book unless you have a self-cleaning oven. The recipes are good, the method produces juicy rare meat, and I've always liked Kafka's opinionated palate. But unless you enjoy cleaning your oven wait until you hire a maid or have a self-cleaning method to rid yourself of the cooked on spatters from this method of roasting. I had a new clean oven, good thermostat, and followed her methods to the letter. I produced juicy meat with crisp skin (chicken) in record time. But the entire oven needs cleaning after each roast. Not fun. If your grill will crank up to 500 and hold that heat for an hour you might be able to make these recipes. Otherwise think twice if you have an ordinary oven. The pan sizes given for various roasts also seem pretty small and tend to drip the fat all over the oven floor."
5,Money saver,"I had a nise floor lamp for several years before its switch started to give me trauble. Then it stopped working at all. I was upset that I had to through away the lamp in perfect condition because of one small part. When I found this part replacement, I was very happy. It's fit perfectly and it was easy to instole. I certanly recomend the product to everybody."
5,This book was the answer to my questions.,"This book was the answer to my questions. It gave me in-depth explanation of what is happenning, the cause of it ,and how it should be aproached. I have two children with same problem .They are both underachievers (different types though, as I learned). I agree with the author that many times parents preffer to put their child on the pill, and take responsibility off their shoulders. ADHD can not be always the answer.I haven't finished the book, as it wrritten in somewhat technical launguage with many diagrams and psychology terms. So,I take ""1 tbsp at the time"". The most important, that this book has been very helpful to me."
4,Dreamland.,"Imagine your sister running away, drifting away from your friends, and a controlling boyfriend all in an instant. That is exactly what Caitlin's life has become, in Sarah Dessen's Dreamland. This emotional story shows one girls strength to persevere through everything life throws at her. Sarah Dessen's novel, Dreamland, is an empowering story that all young women should read.Young women are faced with many hardships while growing up, and Sarah Dessen works through many of these difficult challenges in Dreamland. During the course of this novel, the reader feels like Caitlin's close confidant. Caitlin has a voice of insecurity and fear, and her message penetrates through the pages. The novel teaches you valuable life lessons as we learn about Caitlin's daily struggles with her sister's absence, her parent's grief, and the boy she's crazy about. Dreamland is an easily relatable book, and a charming story of hope, endurance, and knowing tomorrow will always be a better day."
3,Touching Story,"Touching story about a teenager who has bitten off way more than she can handle. If you like Lifetime movies, then you'll enjoy Dreamland."
3,Haunting.,"I liked but didn't love this book. It kind of reminds me of a typical TV movie about teen relationships, drugs, and abuse...it wouldn't surprise me if it became one. Personally, I thought that the characters were under-developed, except for Caitlin. (Obviously, she's the most important.) I had no real sense of who anyone else was. Some of the moments of anticipated violence/abuse were powerful and scary. More should have been said about Caitlin's feelings for Rogerson so her actions could be better understood. Even she was a bit of a mystery."
4,Must read for teen girls!,"Great story with complex issues. A must read for high school girls, or anyone in their first intimate relationship. Enjoyed the characters ... a good read."
4,Dreamland,I haven't quite finished the book but so far it is really a great read; very relatable yet takes the reader's mind on a journey.
3,Alright,"This book is alright, not the worst book i have have ever read but it isn't the best. I feel like the story through the beginning and the middle was good describing the abusive relationship between caitlin and rogerson, but i didn't care to much for the end. Just not a good ending for me."
3,ehh...,I remember reading this when i was younger and loving it and so i decided to read it as an adult and although i like the story line it was a bit boring.
5,Awesome book!!,"I loved this book!! I picked it up and started reading it a little bit but then put it back down.. I went back to the library the next week and I got the book.. I was drawn to it.. I started not being able to put the book down.. I had to get past some of the begining to really get into it, but once I did, I got into the whole thing and couldn't put it down.. The book really related to a similar situation that I was in.. Except I never got hit, I just got the verbal abuse.. I knew what she felt like, because I did what she did, I hid everything, my body, what was going on, and I broke away from my friends.. I loved this book and I hope that every teenage girl reads it and gets a little insight on what can happen in a relationship like this and to look for warning signs in abusive boyfriends.. Everyone should read this, and I hope they do.. Everyone needs to know what 1 person can go through and what the effect that they can have on people's lives.. Highly recommended 5 stars!!!"
5,Appropriate color for most anyone,"Cream blush is the way to go - most cosmeticians are using it today in their salons. This coloris good for almost anyone - it is neither dark nor too light. The product does not ""run"" and is notgreasy. The little mirror is nice to use when traveling or out of the house."
2,Rostropovich disappointed me,"I have heard different versions of Mr. Rostropovich playing the Dvorak cello concerto, over the years. I was looking forward, hopefully, to hearing him at his more eloquent, but this playing tho nice enough, was not ""wonderful"" for me. I shall keep searching for him, to carry me away happily."
1,Tylenol Sinus,"Product was extremely overpriced and near expiration date. It was not packaged well for shipping. However, returning the product was made simple and easy."
5,The finest performances of Nos. 17 and 21,Geza Anda's performance of Mozart's 21st piano concerto is simply gorgeous. All other performances pale before it. His performance of the 17th concerto is also superb and No. 6 makes a welcome filler. No one who loves Mozart should pass up this disc.
4,"Solid, if not spectacular","This CD is an excellent remastering of an earlier recording, but I thought the sound was a little lifeless at some points. Prokofiev's intentional discord in some parts was a little jarring to my ear, but that's a feature of the music, not the performance. I think you would be surprised to recognize parts of this music even if you think you've never listened to Prokofiev. Bits of these soundtracks have been recycled for other films than these. This is a worthwhile addition to your collection."
5,Brilliant Abbado,"I bought this recording without knowing the works and I don't regret that. This CD didn't only turn out to contane great works but also some of the greatest conducting I have ever heard. This disk shows Abbado at his best, tecnically brilliant and lyric to the out most. This recording has it all. Buy it!!"
2,Not accessible,"I think those who are already well-educated on fashion would find this interesting, but as a regular person who's just interested in understanding the changes throughout the past century (hemlines, makeup, fabrics, colors..) I found this book totally inaccessible. It seems to be more of a history of fashion as an art form and of the high-fashion designers' collections and without really clear dates or references to how ordinary people wore styles."
1,Garbage,"This is the SECOND set of sensa-tracs I bought here. Had to return the first set....right out of the box one of the shocks had absolutely NO RESISTANCE when you pushed down on it or pulled up on it. Since shocks should always be replaced in pairs, I returned both. Amazon was great, and sent me out a new set right of way.I'll be dogammed....the new replacement set for the first defective set arrived and right out of the box, one of the shocks was leaking oil from the seal where shaft meets cylinder and also offered no resistance when I checked it...the other seemed ok, but, by then confidence in the product was shot. I returned this set as well. Still waiting for a refund.Unbelievable."
2,"Good, but the info is free","On one side, this is a good book.On the other side, ALL of the definitions are easily available on the net for free.At google, just enter DEFINE:word to be defined, and wallah, you have the definition.Not sure why anyone would want to pay for this book, unless they had a long flight where they would want to read."
4,my Bonnie,"As a triumph owner for thirty five years ( same bike) I've read my share of books on the marque. This book is entertaining without being over technical. Great photography and a few insightful remarks from hugie hancox et.al. I would highly recommend J.R. Nelsons book "" bonnie"" for a more detailed overview. A new millennium chapter brings you up to speed on hinkleys latest offerings.Overall,highly recommended. It'll leave you wanting more."
3,Not as good as it should be,"I've owned an 8 pc plate setting of Pfaltzgraff Heritage white dinnerware for 11 years. It has chipped and has stainless steel marks in the center of all the plates. Overall, I am NOT satisfied and would have bought something else had I known. I even tried cleaning each individual plate with specialized Pfaltzgraff cleaner and it did not remove the marks. Buy something else."
2,Stereo Headphone Adaptor,I bough it for my LG phone it is a little larger than the one design for it so it messes up the sound when inserted all the way in.
4,Good product.,"The adapter is working fine right now. The cable's rubber sheathing is separating from the microphone housing after a few months of use, so I'm afraid the cable may break one of these days."
5,Useful pshychology,"Why do we get sucked in to buying things we don't want? How do we get tricked by Hare Krishnas at the airport? What's the most effective way to ask for help in an emergency?These are the practical insights we all wish we learned in Psychology 101. Before the Behavioralists were winning Nobel prizes, Cialdini was explaining to us the psychological underpinnings behind how we are influenced. These psychological shortcuts explain much of how we act irrationaly in the world.This isn't rocket science, but understanding the concepts in the book will make the reader a better manager as well as a better consumer. Enjoy!"
4,Very interesting,"A very interesting read. Great stories and examples to drive home the main points. Useful for consumer behavior classes, or any psych class in general. See if the library has it first... it is short."
4,Too much Mozart,"Okay, this is Mozart, and I like Mozart. But this is too much Mozart. After a while, except for maybe Symphony 41, all the music begins to blend together. There's not much variety nor diversity in this recording, albeit a good and worthy CD. Only if you are a die-hard Mozart fanatic should you buy this one. Enjoy!"
2,Good for starters but dont expect too much.,"I bought this item after reading a little reviews about it, but it was just like was reviewed. It is good to get young children excited about learning about a ""micro-world"". But you can also quickly loose their attention if it doesn't work really well. The lens is not very clear to make out what you are looking at. You have to keep the specimen very close and still under the scope to make out anything. Not good for kids with little patience"
1,Do NOT Buy!!!,"I bought this microscope for my 8 year old on his birthday. He was really excited about using it, but when we got it open and started to play with it, we quickly realized that the light did not work. Needless to say, without the light the microscope is completely useless."
5,Super Nintendo Adaptor,FAST service I would order from this place again. The item that we ordered came in great condition.
1,terrible cheap copy,don't buy it will ruin your system. it made the screen turn different colors then will burn out the AC plug in.
2,Not the advertised product,"I had purchased this product because the description said that it was the ""Official and Original Super Nintendo AC AdapterNintendo Brand"" but what I received was one of the junky 3 in 1 NES, SNES, Sega Genesis adapters. The product I received works, however it was not what I ordered at all. If I wanted one of the 3 in 1 adapters I could have purchased one for a third of the price I paid for this."
1,super nintendo ac adapter,this plug did not pass enough power to power on either of my super nintendos. I was very disappointed. In the end I ordered one off of walmart.com and it works perfectly!!
4,The Ozarks: An Excellent Early View,"While not as famous as Lewis and Clark, Henry Schoolcraft conducted the first of his many expenditions with similar care and attention to detail. One needs to excuse some of the poetic descriptions. The book gives an excellent insight into the very early development of the region shortly after the Voyage of Discovery.The author has considerable personal research with Schoolcraft's travels as a college professor leading field trips on portions of the expedition. The most helpful is the author's appendix which keys the days of travel to current day locations.For anyone studying the Missouri and Arkansas Ozarks, this is a must-have. It provides the only contemporary vision of this part of the United States prior to the rapid development in the years prior to the Civil War."
2,"Like me, this book did not age well","I just finished Child of Fortune and I was glad to be done with it. I found the The language obtuse and awkward and the characters unlikable. I'm not afraid of words or a meandering plot; they can be fun, c.f. China Mieville or Ian M Banks.Here we end up with a protagonist who starts out as a spoiled ""child of Fortune"" manages to make very little progress over very many pages."
3,QUICK REVIEW CARDS,THESE CARDS HAVE SOME VERY USEFUL STUDY INFORMATION ON THEM BUT I WAS EXPECTING THEM TO BE IN A QUESTION AND ANSWER FORMAT. I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE INTERESTING WAY TO STUDY AND PREPARE FOR EXAMS.
5,A priceless study tool!,"The are not flash cards. The information you need to know is broken down in to sections and put in to table format so it makes it easier to memorize and refer back to. I hole punched my cards and put them on book rings, so that I didn't have to lug around the whole stack all the time. Buy these cards when you start the clinical laboratory science training program because they are also super helpful throughout training, not just for preparing for the state licensing exam. I highly recommend!"
4,Great!!,"The only thing I don't like about the cards is that since they are too many, I wanted to keep them together, have them spiral-bound, to keep the order. But there is not enough space around any of the sides to do this. I've been looking for maybe a box that can hold them so that I can put them away without loosing any of them, but haven't found any. Too bad :/"
2,MLT exam review cards,"These cards are outdated! The copy-right on them is 2000. Some of the information is still current, and they are helpful, but there are newer, common tests that aren't mentioned. Find a more current set if you're studying for the Board exam."
2,Poor condition,"The book is in poor condition. No dust cover, cover is torn, dirty, pages are very yelllowed none of which was stated. It's an old library copy which is not a problem for me and it's legible so I will keep it and read it but I would not offer it for sale or trade without noting the really poor condition."
5,Who says unmusical?,Do not pay any attention to the person who called this Cd dreadful! The person who wrote that review expressed very umusical comments on something he won't ever be able to understand because it is higly musical. Worthless words that this reviewer spends damaging anybody else but himself. Buy and enjoy this Cd which bears the signature of two great musicians who know a great deal about tempo and real music!
3,"worth hearing, but not my first choice","This is a noteworthy reading of Prokofiev's concerto. It's stunning, virtuosic playing, across a range of beautiful colors from pianist and orchestra. But I find it overly aggressive, and rather heavy-handed. You won't be sorry you bought this disc, but if you're looking for the best Prokofiev 3rd I prefer Gary Graffman's leaner, better-balanced reading with Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra."
1,Dreadfull,"This is simply the worst recording of this concerto. I realize she was young, but it is unmusical, almost as if the idea is to play just the opposite of what the composition calls for. Sort of out Gould Gould. The slow movement has no tempo whatsover, just lays there and Abbaddo's conducts in his 2nd rate Von Karajan style. Avoid this."
1,Handles are weak and break,I bought 2 sets for my daughter-in-law a little over a year ago for a wedding present. The handles have weakened and are breaking off where they are attached to the cup.
1,"""It will gain us nothing...""","My experience reading this book many years ago was that I hated it so much I through it in the trash. What I recall is the author saying she got nothing substantial out of anything she read, that she was essentially addicted, and reading so many books without purpose except to while away the time, or as some escape. She didn't title it Ruined By Reading for nothing - she pretty much said she wasted time and didn't learn a thing. I agree with the few negative reviews. I was looking for inspiration, and wound up with the exact opposite! I'll use the quote from a fellow reviewer, about what the author said about reading: ""'It will gain us nothing but enchantment of the heart.' But for those of us who are `book addicts, perhaps that is' enough.'"" Ugh!"
2,Swanson's $4.99/lb product tastes just as good,"I purchased Lewis the first time at the grocery store, where it is waaaay overpriced. I was reluctant to try Swanson's brand because Lewis touts its brand as the only one that does not have a bad taste. I tried Swanson's brand based on a favorable review on their website which claimed it had no bad taste, so I bought a couple cans. I cannot tell any difference in appearance or taste between Lewis Labs and Swanson's. And Swanson's is much cheaper :D!"
1,"don't waste your $$, could be played with regular card","Like wizards game game, but not as good. Decided to leave at resort."
3,I hope it works!,"Just started using the shampoo and conditioner. I gave it 3 stars because it is too early to tell if it is working or not, but either way, I like the hair product and the price was reasonable, especially compared to some other hair products in stores and salons."
3,I dont see it,"This appears to be a pretty pendant, but I can not see the silhouette of Jesus. I had my hubby look at it and he aggrees. I wish there was a way to contact the company and ask. If anyone see its let me know!:)"
5,A #1 first book,"I enjoyed the prose of this novel. The plot was great. However, I, too, did not think the antiSemitism was revelant at all and wondered why it was introduced. A really good court thriller."
4,Changes,"Atticus transformed. At the end, is he still a bodyguard? And does ballet change everything? The author is taking chances and keeping this series interesting."
4,"Hadn't read others in series, still enjoyed it","This was my first Atticus Kodiak book and I didn't have any trouble getting into the plot or getting a feel for the characters. The book is so action packed, the character development takes a backseat anyway.The author does a great job of developing an interesting plot in different locales, bringing in characters you love and hate, and coming to an exciting conclusion. Definitely a great escape read."
5,My kid loves it,"Well made, great quality product. My kid loves it. It is light weight so easy to move. No complaints about the product."
5,A gift for my niece,"My niece (6) and nephews ( 9 and 12) really enjoyed this game. I plan on ordering this for my daughter's birthday later this month (8) for family game night. My mom (grandma) played, as well, and said I needtoget one for our house. Fun!"
4,"I prefer the Kreisler cadenza, but still a good performance","What I liked about the Beethoven is the way the orchestra under Jochum's direction has more than just a secondary role. The parts where the soloist is not playing do not just sound like background interludes, but take on a more integral part of the work. Schneiderhan plays with a beautiful tone throughout, and shares Jochum's concept of the music.However, I do not care for the cadenza Schneiderhan uses. I tried very hard to listen with an open mind, and at first I found the changes to be refreshingly different. But before long, they became distracting and disrupted the flow of the music. So for me, this recording will not displace Menuhin/Furtwangler, Francescatti/Walter, or Heifetz/Munch. Still, it's worth hearing as an alternate version, and the recorded sound is outstanding, easily surpassing any of the three recordings mentioned above."
3,An Ok phone...but,"This is a very basic phone. It is easy to set up, relatively sturdy, but I find the volume a little too low and wish there was a volume control. I prefer the similar Uniden phone I replaced it with. We've had several uniden and they last 3-5 years before the battery needs replacing (usually more costly than replacing the phone :( ).I expect this one will last as long- but the volume issue is annoying enough that I would definately buy the Uniden over this phone. They cost about the same (although with all the price variances...the uniden typically runs a dollar or 2 less)."
1,Buyer Beware,"This may be the worst phone ever. The battery lasts only a few hours off the charger and it will NOT place outgoing calls. You can push numbers, but the only person you get on the other line is the operator. Incoming calls are fine, but you canNOT dial out. Spent another 5-10 dollars are get a phone that functions as it should."
4,Pleased Customer,"This product is a good value for the price. It arrived quickly and intact. I would prefer to use rechargeables, however only these will work in my old camera. I would recommend them if your camera won't take rechargeables."
1,Worst adhesive available,"I bought this product to glue up a bent lamination of hard maple. Beginning with a test gluing phase, I mixed one batch by volume and after letting the glue cure for 24 hours the glue up delaminated with ease. I then made another mixture by weight and came up with the same results. DAP products are consistently inferior and after my troubles with their plastic resin glue I'm sure I will no longer purchase any of their products again. What did work in place of this brand was unibond 800."
3,I Expected More,"Being a history buff and interested in sunken ships, I had missed the television showing of this film on the Discovery Channel due to other commitments. So I ordered the DVD and anxiously awaited its release to that format. Rewatching it recently, I have to say it is mildly disappointing. The underwater footage is excellent, but there isn't enough of it. The history of the ship and sinking is decent, but not extensive. The recreations are well made, but at times out of place. The interviews with survivors pretty moving and helpful, but don't add as much as pure narration could have. Some of the questions about the sinking and final fate of the ship are brought up ambiguously and, apparently resolved, yet not convincingly and in an anti-climatic fashion. Overall, I didn't get the amount of pure footage of the sunken ship that I expected. The bonus materials on the second disc are essentially worthless. The main complaint? More underwater footage was needed to make this worthwhile."
4,Best of Rob Zombie,"Classic Rob Zombie,hard flipping rock! Love Living Dead Girl, And House of 1000 corpses. Over all it's great.Worth the coin to buy it."
4,readable account of an outstanding individual,"heard the taped version of colin powell: soldier/statesman, statesman/soldier by howard means . . . very readable account of how he grew up in the poverty-riden south bronx to become the highest ranking military official in the nation . . . my only regret: it was written in 1992, and i now find myself wanting to know more about this outstanding individual . . . he would certainly have my vote in an election; in fact, as part of a bradley-powell ticket? (i dream, but do like the sound of that!)i also liked hearing again the quote from his famous 1991 press briefing, in which he described the alied strategy for the desert storm war: ""Our strategy for going after this army is very, very simple. First we are going to cut it off, and then we are going to kill it."""
4,Good book for those interested in dance.,Book was exactly what I needed for class. Didn't come with a cover but that wasn't important at all.
3,Beautiful - cheaper to buy individual single serving sets.,"This is a beautiful set of dinnerware. The color matches the colors in my kitchen perfect. One thing I noticed after I got this set... I was going to buy 2 more individual sets to add to my 4 serving set so I would have service for 6. Anyway, for less than the price I paid for a service for 4 set I could have bought 6 individual sets. Unless this changes I would recommend buying 4 individual sets for a lot less than the 4 serving set. You do get 4 free glasses, but if you really don't need them, like me, the 4 individual sets are cheaper. My only guess is they do not sell a lot of single serving sets so that is why they are cheaper. Beacuse of this I gave it 3 stars. Based on the colors and so far quality I would give it 5 stars."
4,"Very well-written book, software not so good","The book is one of the clearest I have read as a text book. Why cant everybody write like this?? There is very good flow throughout the text.Only complaint is the software. It looks the software has not kept pace with the book itself. Some additional software has to be added (for Transform coding, for instance), and some references in the text book to the software are incorrect. If the accompanying software is upgraded, as it should be, I will rate this book a clear 5-star."
5,Great condition,My book came to me in great condition and also took about how long you would expect for an Amazon order to get to me. Very satisfied!
5,Romantic Literary Paris of the 1920's,"Anybody who loves reading about the romantic literary Paris of the 1920's will love this non-fiction book, written by a Canadian author, Morley Callaghan, of his time there with Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds, and other famous authors of the era. I have read That Summer in Paris twice and loved it. If you like biographies of famous writers, you will love this book. It was a very touching well-written memoir."
5,Great performance,"I'm surprised at the number of negative opinions on this performance. Kempff's performance in this recording is understated, beautiful and contemplative. Beethoven was never an one dimensional composer. This is a great recording of some of the greatest piano sonatas ever written."
1,Where are the pictures???,"JOHN DOUGH AND THE CHERUB is a great story, fully as good as most Oz books, but this edition does not seem to contain the original illustrations by Jno. R. Neill. These illustrations were fantastic, really brought the characters and events to life.If you're considering buying JOHN DOUGH, get an edition with the original pictures. The Dover edition has them."
5,I'll tell you why classical people are grumpy Mr. Hurwitz...,"Its from reading reviews like your which tell us essentially nothing more than the title of the album and that Martha Argerich plays the Liszt B Minor Sonata! Besides, what would you like them to call the album: ""Martha Argerich Debut Recital, Which Happens To Include Her Important Performance Of The Liszt B Minor Sonata As Well As Some Chopin And Several Tracks Which Aren't Actually From Her Debut Recital But For Some Reason We've Included Them Anyway""? Great CD though!"
5,Rock then Roll,"This is the music we've been waiting for! New, fresh and hauntingly different from anything out there. One minute you're rocking your body to the heavy drums, guitar and keyboard combinations and the next your head is rolling with the suductive vocals lulling you into a trance-like state that lets you step into another dimension for a few moments. If you want an otherworldy experience with no dangerous re-entry risk. . . . give this a listen."
4,Back to the Sixties,"This is more retro than I had been led to believe, like Stereolab masquerading as one of the artier psychedelic bands of the 60s, like Ultimate Spinach. But very groovy. The female singer--no names are given, nor a photo of the band, which lost them a star--has a voice almost as low as Nico's, and the predominance of minor chords gives the music a dark feel. The guitarist is a great mimic of 60s guitar sounds; I heard echoes of the Electric Prunes and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, among others. And is that a Vox Continental organ I hear occasionally? Recommend to people who like the ""Nuggets"" compilations."
1,crap from start to finish,"there's no way wes craven made this. it is just too, horribly bad. i mean, c'mon. monty python and the holy grail is scarier then this. don't waster your money on this trash.p.s. DIE LINDA BLAIR, DDDDDDDDDIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Rich voice filled with emotion -- superb!,"A splendid rendition of Rodger & Hammerstein by one of the great voices of today. The bold notes reverberate with richness, the soft ones strain with emotion."
1,Review of Wilson team gearbag,"I bought a Wilson team gear bag for my high school age son's baseball equipment {catching gear, batting helmet, bats, shoes, etc.).The bag lasted less than one week before the seams started to separate.Obviously, I won't buy another Wilson equipment bag. Wilson A2000 catcher's mitts are very durable, the bags are not."
2,I didn't Feel a Connection With Her,"The book started out well enough but it got rehashed so many times and the author didn't really seem to ever get over her problems. She kept forcing herself on her old boyfriend and taking a lot of crap from her son whom she bent over backwards to give him everything. She should have let go of him a long time before. Let him decide when he will get back into her life because he was obviously making her feel worse. My opinion is that she should never even have tried to find her son's father. I think she wanted to find him more for herself than for her son. And she kept making the same mistakes over and over again. I couldn't really feel for her. And I really did have a hard time believing in that ""virgin birth"" although I guess it is possible. I am glad I got the book for free."
1,amazon shouldn't sale this item,why is so cheap ??? is it god enough?off course amazon is so good that now is give them for free....think about it!!!
1,NO iPhone 3G Compatability!,It doesn't work with iPhone 3G - false advertisement! I gave it to my cousins who have the nano... Waste!
3,NOT iPod Touch 2G or 3G Compatible--Don't be fooled!,"This charger is NOT COMPATIBLE with either the iPod Touch 2G or 3G. It's output voltage is 9v, but the iPod Touch requires a 5v charger. When the charger is plugged into the iPod Touch a message displays on the screen saying that it can not be charged with this charger. Too bad, it is a nice, high-quality charger. Just check to see if your iPod requires a 9v charger before you buy. Sure would be nice if they just listed this IMPORTANT SPECIFICATION in the product details. Five stars for the charger, but zero stars for whoever wrote the product and compatibility specs."
1,NOT FOR IPOD NANO!,"I have really needed a charger for quite a while. I finally found a charger that looked decent and in the description slearly states it is also for the IPOD NANO. So with a pretty good bargain, I bought this charger and it broke 5 minutes into a charge with my IPOD NANO!!! I check around the house to see if there were any other outlets that would work, but there wasn't. I am very upset with getting my 10 dollars back, re-shipping it, leaving feedback, and having to search for a new charger. Please, if you want a good charger spend a few more bucks and get one with good quality."
4,Just as described,"Received in a timely manor. Worked well, was just as described and got it at a great price. Can't be beat."
5,Best Charger for the Best Price,"Definately the best made charger around. Works great. Fully Chargest my ipod in 1 hour. Small and easy to travel with. Very cheap the only bad thing is that shipping is pretty expensive, so while your at it buy other things as well."
5,It works just like original one. Why pay more?,"Yeah. I've been using it for more than a year now.It work, so why bother with overpaying for the original one?"
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This One!,Don't waste your money on this! Bought it in January 2007 and it's already broken in May 2007.
4,imagination,I can't believe the lack of puppets available in the market. And then when we purchased this for our 7 year old I couldn't believe the product. She loves it and her 12 year old sister wants one now too. Thank you!!!
5,Best Purchase for My Granddaughter,"My 2 year old granddaughter recently became aware of monsters! She could not stop talking about them. Although she didn't seem terribly afraid of them she seemed to know they were scarey! So I thought this product would be a great way to teach her not to be afraid of monsters. It worked! She's had lots of fun making her own monsters with Nana, Mommy and Daddy. The interchangeable parts offer a great variety of monsters to create. The colors are bright and cheery and the quality of this product is great! I love how all the different monster parts can be stored in the package it came in. Very convenient. Best purchase for my granddaughter."
3,Scarecrowing literally runs in the family.,"The crows end up chasing the little scarecrow novice, and as he runs away from them in lushishly illustated strawy discombobulation, he makes each face he has practiced to scare crows away. But, ironically, not one of his ""scarecrow faces"" does actually scare the crows away, and he is carried away by the big black birds. No, just kidding. He just ends up being saved from the untold fate with the crows by his father. This book definitely gets its ""charm"" from simplicity, but it works. I read it three times in a row to a three year old in the special needs class today. Nice, simple, autumn themed book-it is."
2,Nice but Fragile,"I bought eight of these glasses two years ago, and only two have survived the light use that we have put them through. They get a hairline fracture and pow! they break. I would say cheap quality however the pattern is nice and it matches the Orleans dinnerware very well."
5,An accurate account of World War 2 aerial combat,"When I first read this book, I was in 6th grade. Now I am in 11th and I still read this book when I can. It was wonderfuly written and execllent images Harry Mazer used. I say that it was a great book and everyone should read it.Getting in the Air Force at 15 and making it at the end, never read something like it."
3,Better off with the first album,"I already owned their first album and really loved it, so I bought this one without hearing anything from it first. Mistake! The singer really ruins it for me this time around and the tunes just don't seem as creative."
1,Society in America,"I needed to receive this book for a summer college class that is only 5 weeks long. I was excited to get the book and start reading. However when I got the book, it was only the first 48 pages of a 365 page book. This did not help me in anyway and was a complete waste of money."
4,EarJams improve the fit in my ear,"I bought the EarJams largely because of frustration keeping the stock Apple earplugs in my ears. They kept falling out. The EarJams have helped alot on that score. Individual ears vary a lot so there's no guarantee these will do it for you, but these fit me pretty well, if not perfectly. They also dramatically inprove the amount of bass that reaches your eardrum. I've never heard a high-end earplug but I'm happy enough with the sound I get from the Apple earplugs with the EarJams on them."
4,"great for podcasts, make apple ear buds fit better","I listen to mostly books and podcasts, so these little do dads work just great for me. The cheap iPod ear buds are very uncomfortable and tend to fall out of your ears, so these little converters do help in keeping the earbuds in place if you're exercising. The sound quality is adequate for my needs; I have some sony ear buds that work better for music and also fit better, but these at least make the apple ear buds usable as a backup pair. The sony ear buds do cancel out noise (like in a fitness center) better, but there may be times when you don't want to be deaf to the world. The cute little case and the extra sized buds are a nice addition."
1,Unfortunate that they do not fit my earbuds,"I think that these would be great, but they do not fit on the newer iPhone ear buds even though it is also considered an iPod...The vendor refunded my money but of course made some on the shipping and handling.So if you are looking for enhancement for you iPhone playback ... well, I guess you are going to have to wait..."
2,"good concept, bad execution.","I was really looking forward to using the earjams for my iphone. unfortunately even though it may cancel out noise, the sound that these buds give are horrible. The bass sounds way too loud and they never seem secure in the ear. Don't waste your money on these."
2,Doesn't fit new Apple earbuds with remote,"I bought these to use with the new iPod Shuffle earbuds. Since the controls are on the earbud wire, I thought I'd just make them more ear-friendly, instead of messing with an adapter cable. Unfortunately, the EarJams are too large for the earbuds, and there's no way to attach them. So, it's back toInnovelis BudFits - Vanilla Whitefor me."
1,Not worth a dime,I bought these because my iPod earphones don't stay in during a workout.Incredibly these fit even worse! (none of the 3 sizes of rubbery earpieces stay in).And (as many of the reviews mention) they make the sound worse.What a piece of junk.
4,ear jams,The earjams are easy to use. They transform the standard earphones to better fitting in-ear type. The case included is not very useful.
2,Really low sound quality,"I ran out of the little sponge-like earbuds so I decided to try these. What a waste of money! Good thing that they were only $ 10 plus s&h, because I used to be quite surprised by how good of a sound I got from my little nano, but with these things on it sounds like your covering your ears and music is trying to find its way to your ear drums but not getting there at all! They are pretty comfortable though, but who cares about that if you can't appreciate your music because it sound so dolled out. Do yourself a favor and buy the spongy thingies!!"
1,Product is useless.,"I have three sets of Apple earpods that came with a Nano, iPod, and iPhone respectively which I purchased over the last couple of years so they are all the same model. None are different in respect to size, shape, appearance or quality. This Griffin product would not fit on any of them. The adapters were much larger than the earpods and would not attach as advertised. I even tried to super glue them to one pair and the plastic used would not adhere to the earpod plastic. This product is worthless and the cost of returning them negated the possibility of breaking even on a return."
3,be very careful if you try to remove from the Ear Buds,If you happen to need or want to remove the Ear Jams from the Ear Buds do so very carefully. You are at risk of opening the Ear Bud and making them unusable. It seems that I broke the wire connection in one of the Buds as the Ear Jam is so firmly in place that it caused the left Bud to open up when I tried to remove it. The outcome is that I'm currently looking for a replacement set of earphones. Whoops...
2,Sounds terrible,"These were available for $8 shipped, so I figured, what do I have to lose? Answer: $8. They make the volume much louder, as advertised. Problem is, they completely degrade the tone - it sounds like you are listening to the earphones through a tube (which I guess you essentially are).I gave them 2 stars because judging from the reviews, I figured there are many people who will not be able to tell the difference in the sound. I tossed them - recommend to pass on this one."
1,Not compatible with 5G Ipod,"I bought these hoping they'd make my IPod buds more comfortable. Unfortunately they don't fit the new IPods. So... I can't really rate their performance -- except to say don't buy for a 5G IPod. Thankfully, I tested these in the parking lot and immediately returned them.Also, they seem rather flimsy and over-priced to me -- almost twenty bucks in most stores. I don't think they're worth half that."
1,Unusable,"Yes, the fit was better, but what was gained in bass response was negated by the reduction in highs. I was surprised these actually made it to production since the sound was so adversely affected. I returned them the next day and have found several other earbuds that seal the ear canal and provide audio fidelity."
2,a nice case,"For the $7 I paid, they were an ok deal and at least the case should be handy. They do indeed provide a better isolation seal when added to the ipod earbuds and increase the volume. But I agree with comments I have heard that they make the sound a bit like listening in a tin can. The sound is ok at low levels if you play around with the equalizer settings on the ipod. I prefered ""loudness"" setting. Long term comfort was NOT great for me either. Short term comfort was ok. They are mostly collecting dust for me in the ""nice try"" pile."
4,"Good quality, a little overpriced","a smart little device that is helpful. it's cheap plastic and costs about 25 cents to make, so it seems expensive at $20 (you could buy other headphones instead for that price). but if you can find them on sale, they help keep your earbuds in your ear. customers should be aware that they do increase the bass and volume levels considerably due to their tube shaped design."
3,Bueno para exteriores,aumenta bastante el sonido en exteriores aunque se reduce los agudos de los audios algo que no me gusto mucho...
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Plain and simple... they do not snap on AT ALL. They are too big and so they fall right off.HORRIBLE product.
3,"Works well, but oh, the smell","This conditioner works very well - my hair feels silky soft after I use it, and de-tangles instantly in the shower when I put it on. I love the fact that it's organic and natural ingredients.My only problem with it is the sickly sweet floral scent which lingers too long."
1,"So disappointed, I was a fan for years.","I have used this product faithfully for years. I know it like the back of my hand. I recommended it to so many people. And then they up and changed the formula, which was perfect. And they *ruined* it!! I hate it now!I don't know what has happened to Aubreys. They have changed their formulas. I was so devoted to buying all of my products from them. I can no longer use their products. Why in the world would anyone mess with perfection. I am so incredibly disappointed. Honeysuckle Rose was my absolute *ultimate* conditioner. And it just does not work the same anymore. And the formula is completely different.Nearly every health and beauty product in my home used to be Aubreys, no I must find a new brand. I am not happy about this."
1,Very disappointed,"I spent a lot of time looking up ""natural organic"" hair products. I finally settled on Aubrey because of the great ingredients list. I got the shampoo and conditioner yesterday and used them. My hair felt like hay. I was so disappointed. I read the ingredients and they were so different from what is listed on the amazon site. Water and alcohol are now the first two ingredients, Rather than aloe and a coconut cream base. This is false advertising. I am going to try to let amazon know. I now checked the other reviews and see someone else noted the same thing. Wish I had checked the reviews first. Don't buy it."
3,Great shampoo,"The shampoo works terrifically but apparently my hair isn't dry so I ended up with the wet look as it weighed my hair down tremendously. My husbands hair is dry, thick and course so it worked better on his. Word to the wise: If your scalp is dry, that doesn't mean your hair is. Shoot for their ""all hair types"" shampoo as that one was wonderful and the scent wasn't too bad either."
2,Not for me,"I don't really care much for this product. It's not thick enough and it left my hair feeling stringy, coarse, and brittle. I usually like aloe in my hair, but apparently I do not like aloe in a conditioner. Also, this conditioner smells like lemon scented mopping solution. There is no universe in which I find myself wanting to smell like mopping solution after a shower. I don't have anything against lemon fragrance, quite the contrary. I usually like the refreshing zing of lemon in a body care product, but this stuff just smells funky. I don't recommend this for people with my hair type (3B, doing curly girl), but perhaps this works for some people. Personally, I think the Aubrey brand is going down the crapper since they started changing their ingredients."
3,Its a text book what can I say?,"This is a text book, its required for school, thus I don't see why I need to do a review for a required text book that I'm forced to buy."
5,Information not found any where else!,"I was doing genealogical research in South Carolina. This book has a wealth of information about the Santee area of South Carolina. It is not only church history, but provided a glimpse into life in colonial South Carolina and many of the important early inhabitants from Charleston to the central part of the state."
2,Good but not worth it,"Don't get me wrong, this sandpaper is good but I can go up the the hardware store and buy large sheets of any grit for a buck. I do not recommend this product simply because of that fact."
5,Sweet Dust and Dandelion Wine of Youth,"Stegner, whose ambitious works stand as one of the finest legacies of fiction in any language, chronicles his early years in the praries of Dakotas and nearby provinces with some of the most poetic and dignified prose ever offered. Like the author's Angle of Repose, Recapitulation, or Big Rock Candy Mountain, Wolf Willow provides a window to West as experienced by youth; as opposed to merely read. Anyone raised in the West near canyons, who knows the smell of pinon and pepper tress or simple brush of wind over open space of grasslands will identify with and appreciate this gift of autobiography. It breathes like dandelion wine uncorked years after being stored. Highly recommend"
3,Stegnar recalls his teen years and recounts written early history of SW Saskatchewan,"Stegner once again reveals his writing prowess, This time in a self-indulgent adventure to haunts of his youth.I have some qualms about this work, however. In particular, I was not so keen on those parts where Stegner relied heavily on book-based history that never directly touched his own life. To be frank, his writing in these parts surprisingly got a bit stodgy.His thought on sense of place and belonging, however, are remarkable, hitting me right between the eyes. Indeed, he had me wistfully recalling my own childhood in what seemed a remote area of the world with the archaeological junk heap and all. In measuring his boyhood to my own, I noted how little times had changed in that interval of 60-70 years and how much has changed for kids in the last 40. It had me wondering how my own sons lives would be different were it not for the MAFIA (mother's against fun in America)."
2,????,i dont understand why the image doesnt match the product?? is this the Dixie boot or that other shoe? I wont order because I dont want to end up with the wrong shoes. Please fix
2,Outdated already!,"This worked great for our micro SDs in our phones and a 1GB SD we had for our last camera, but when we replaced our camera and upgraded to a 4GB SD the reader no longer works. With large capacity SDs so cheap why would you want to buy a reader that doesn't support them?"
1,Didn't work,Mine was either defective or the device just doesn't work but no go at my house. I wanted to use it for my son's teacher's mini card but it won't even work on my standard sized memory card. Buy with caution.
5,"Simple and direct singing, great voice",Wunderlich had one of the great voices and he is in fine form here. His approach is simple and direct. That is wrong in Schubert? Maybe not quite up to the Fischer-Dieskau/Moore set but a great recording.
5,Great Band Great Album,"Very nice piece of creative psychedelic rock. Haven't heard something this original in a while keep it up guys. This album is worth it if your into psychedelic rock or just rock in general. The music and lyrics are all great. Also i might add these guys are awesome live so if you get the chance get out and see them. Also i've met these guys at one of their shows their all really cool and will do autographs and photos with no complaints, Great Guys and Great musicians. They have excellent showmanship and are very skilled and tight as a band."
2,boringgggggggg,skip it really not better than breakdown with kurt russelits simple avoid this dvd no suspense
4,a fun quck summer read although a bit predictable,SEt in contemporary Washington DC this is the story of a single 30 something woman who owns a vintage clothing shop. Her big dilemma is whether to stay with her nice prosperous boyfriend or leave him for the nicer and less prosperous guy she has been having an affair with.
2,Predictable and boring,"This book just didn't do it for me. Although the plot was indeed interesting, and there were some good moments, especially Diana's odd relationship with her father and sisters, for the most part this book just isn't what I thought it would be. I found her constant descriptions about everything, especially what people wore extremely boring and the ending is predictable to say the least.I can't really say that you shouldn't buy this book because is not terrible, but in my humble opinion, it is not good either."
2,"Predictable, easy summer reading","This book was so predictable it could be read while sleepwalking. It's hard to like or admire the main character - a whimpy, whiny, insecure woman who two-times her fiance. We are somehow supposed to laugh along with her and find her whimsical. Word of advice - take it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. It's not worth the money."
3,A gentle little love story,"I refuse to condemn myself for reading this book. It's just a gentle little love story. Not one thing more. No big insights into life, not even into family relationships or love relationships. Nada. Just a dip into another person's shoes for a few hours, a fun little weekend fling with a sweet romance novel."
4,Love and the Neurotic Femail,"If you are a normal female by the definition of normal being neurotic then you will love this book. Plaqued with the perfect sisters and the disfunction, Diana goes through life as the black sheep struggling as we all do for the approval of those we allow in our life by choice or blood. Her life though is disheavled one summer at her father's birthday party (family unions always make for chaos) when she meets a man that offers her emotional support and physical enjoyment something she is lacking in her current relationship. From this point, the reader is allow a small glimsp into her life as this man causes Diana to do some spring cleaning and risk taking in her life."

GOOD PRICE`S FOR 2 ON one dvd.the returns was ok thy show more of tor then the the hulk and when it come to the fighting the hulk work`s a lone not with tor. but it was ok?.the trial of the hulk was ok as well but he did not go to trial. so why did thy call it that?.thank you.
3,Missized...,"Boots seem to be high quality and durable, but unfortunately it is totally missized.I usually wear 12, but these boots were clearly too small.Therefore, had to return."
5,sparkly hair !!,I have been using Roux FanciFul White Minx for 50 years but suddenly it is impossible to find in the stores. thank you Amazon for keeping this oldy but goody available. it is a wonderful rinse .. eliminating the yellow cast to my white hair and leaving it shimmery silver.
3,"Skeptical, sensational and scared","My first opinion of this book was that it was sensational. Even at this time I am still skeptical of some of the events in this book.However, ""Secret Weapon"" does twist all thoughts a reader might have about conspiracy theories and what our government and military really do. The truth is our government does do things that we as citizens of the United States do and do not know. Everyone has heard such theories at one time or another, and some if most are very believable. This book confronts those theories in an eerie manner: Is what these women are saying true? If the answer to this question is yes, then we indeed live in scary times.My suggestion possible readers of this book is to read this with an open mind. I am sure that the actual truths of this book will be revealed either by the declassification of government documents or by more proof being publicized by the authors; who I am sure will continue their quest for truth in another book of this nature."
3,Lack of focus undermines the overall satiric quality,"The movie is described as being a ""black comedy."" Well --- I suppose so. At times the plot developments, such as they were, seemed so paranoid that the intended satirical effect gets buried. It also doesn't help that practically every conspiracy theory known to man gets vacuumed-packed into a film barely an hour and a half long, because the result is an unfocused film that is all over the place.It shouldn't be taken as a comment on the Kennedy assassination & its aftermath...President Kegan and his family bear only slight resemblance to the Kennedys. I suppose the film was intended to lampoon, as much as anything, the subculture of conspiracy theories --- I guess. Between the meandering plot and some breathtaking scenery-chewing on the part of John Huston, Anthony Perkins, and Sterling Hayden, I found myself pretty lost.All in all, I found myself somewhat disappointed by a film which promised a lot more than it ultimately delivered."
5,Clean and Smooth,"If you're true fan of Brant and his style than you will enjoy this acoustic offering. Both personal and political, the lyrics come out intense and is wrapped around his familiar guitars."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I have had three sets of these. Only one of them has worked ""out of the box"" after the requisite day of charging. The first set that I got had the solar panel wired backwards so that it never charged the batteries. The second set had the connectors wired so badly that with all the glue covering it I could never make it work. The third set worked until water started getting into the interior of the light rocks and shorting out the connections. My area is under a drought and has had very little rain in the last 14 months, so the light rocks should not have been able to collect water like that - but they did.All in all, the workmanship was incredibly poor and the company's product support was even worse. Don't buy this!"
3,An Excellent Introduction to the Foundation of Calvinism,"Although I do not find much in Calvinism with which I can agree, I found this text to be an excellent starting point to studying the theological and biblical foundations of Calvinism. I would have given the book one more star, except that I found the historical section way too long. It really did not add much to understanding the foundations of Calvinism, and it really should have considering the length of the chapter on historical theology."
2,Disappointing,"The images in this production are to Celtic illustration what imitation crab meat is to the real thing. Sad to say the quality of the images are just a couple of steps above cartoon art. Also disappointing is the fact that the images were scanned at 300 x 300 dpi. In this day and age, when many printers are cranking out 2,500 dpi, this low level of scanning leaves a lot to be desired. I have purchased other Dover products in the past and have been very pleased. The purchase of this book is one I regret."
4,Another winner from this Nashville songwriter,"Fame may have eluded Shawn Camp as a performer, but he's been quite successful as a Top 40 songwriter and Back Forty twangster... (His debut album from the early 1990s sank like a stone, but it's also pretty good & well worth searching for...) This is his third album in the last few years and like the others, it's a canny mix of unapologetic Nashville formula and true-blue twang. Whether you're coming at this from the hit-oriented mainstream or the alt-Americana side of the street, this disc is sure to set your toes tapping... Recommended! [2006 joesixpack at slipcue dot com]"
1,Waste of time,"I expected to zip through this 'little' book but I suffered through it and finally after 5 days of getting no where, I skipped to the last page.A big waste. Lame plot. I hate it when all the main characters have similar names...all beginning in ""S"". And we were dealing with triplets and their spouses. Too confusing."
1,Painfully bad,I was truly amazed that something this bad could be published. I was embarrassed for the author. I will not buy or read anything else from this author.
5,Keeping Secrets,"Fern Michaels has written a wonderful holiday type story and one you will not be able to put down.Now that the trips are married the doctors have a huge secret and maybe one they should not of kept as it could cost them problems and possibly there marriages and Cisco decides to do something she said she would never do.When things all get settled and straightened out Fern Michaels bring warmth,love and faith at a time when we need it most.A must read and one I highly recommend."
3,"BEAUTIFUL, NOT PRACTICAL","IT MOST CERTINLY IS PRETTY; BUT IT HANGS ON ALL MY CLOTHES. WOULD NOT BUY IT OR ANYTHING LIKE IT AGAIN. REGARDS,DH"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!1,"This was a great film, I love Gamera and all monster Kaiju, and I picked this up at Hollywood video out of plain curiosity. I loved it, the final battle scene was amazing and Gamera was very impressive. All in all this is a film for all true giant kaiju lovers, it's great, but in my opinion Gamera is no Godzilla. I highly prefer Godzilla over Gamera but this was a great film."
4,This movie has EVERYTHING!,"The flying turtle! The battle with Gayos! Giant bird poo! Stomping on buildings! And never ride the train in Tokyo because.. the train always gets destroyed! Gamera always gets a little sloppy, and oops! There goes another building! I'm running out of exclamation points!!!I was a fan of these films when I was a kid, and it took me by suprise that there was a remake in the 90's. I picked up the boxed set and was pleasantly surprised to find that they kept the man-in-the-suit look, the hilarious dubbing, and all of the main staples of good old Japanese monster movie mayhem. No CGI here, plenty of miniatures and slow-mo sloshing water. There's something about those special effects that has a campy nostalgic feel, and it works. I was cheering like a kid watching this film - here he comes! Gamera! I gave it four stars because, well, come on, it is a monster movie, but it does exactly what it set out to do."
4,A talented lady,Creative & talented and different enough to catch your attention. I'd love to see her at a live performan singing in an intimate setting.
2,disappointing,"Nowhere near as compelling as ""Far"". However, I believe Spektor is a bright light in pop music going forward. End"
3,Half and half is all she could do,"When I bought this album it came with an extra disc that was made up of the first six songs of this album and I am supposed to give that to a friend. After listening to the entire album I didn't really want to give it to anybody because letting them listen to just the first six songs is misleading.The first 6 songs are good. Almost better than good. It left me eager to hear what that last six songs would bring, but they didn't bring anything new or lasting. Half of the album is good while the other half is pretty ok.I haven't listened to her other albums so I don't know if this was a one time thing or if this is her history, but I am less than impressed with her and this album especially after all I'd been hearing about her."
3,Full Of Hope,"Begin To Hope is a solid effort from New York singer Regina Spektor. The album moves away from her anti-folk roots and the album has a glossier production. This works well on the lead track and best song on the album, the shimmering ""Fidelity"". Other standout tracks include ""On The Radio"", ""Hotel Song"" and the smoky ""Lady""."
1,I must not get it!,"After reading People Magazine's review on this album, I went out and purchased it. Clearly me, the People reviewer and most reviewers on this site are on different planes! Let me clarify by saying I thought SOME of the lyrics were unique and fresh, but the songs were filled with too much ah ah ah and weird noises. This is and never will be an album discussed amongst groups of people at social gatherings. I don't think it will appeal to a broad audience. I do give Regina kudos for offering a FREE 6 song CD along with Begin to Hope, in hopes her music will get shared. But these tunes were not for me or anybody else I know. I can't even give the real CD away."
3,meh.,"I heard the first song on the album and thought I'd risk it after seeing all the good reviews but quite frankly I'm not that impressed. I like her voice but after a while, every song sounds the same and the more you listen to it the less interesting it gets..."
2,Poor Quality - Avoid (c) 2000 by Anchor Bay,"I ordered the Anchor Bay (c) 2000 edition and then found the Disney version (c) 2004 at the library. There's no comparison. The Anchor Bay version has TV scan lines in it! It's like watching a pixelated mpeg. True, the Anchor bay version has both 1.66 and 2.35 versions on flip sides of the disc, but even the 1.66 version looks bad like it's out of proportion, and not just the opening title got squashed.I'm returning the Anchor Bay version."
5,"silly yet sad, entertaining and wacky. my kinda book.","the main characters life is one of compulsions, strange family members, and people in her life that all somehow connect and make life a little bit stranger. (i felt ""at home"" in such a book!) it has very funny little moments that made me snicker, and i grew compassion for the characters of the book. i read it in two days so that means it was a good one!"
1,"Hated it. Lovely writing, scary details.","A well written book that draws you in has an even stronger punch when it hits you with unpleasant events. Book reflects a fine line between whimsy and madness with details that collide like a fascination with an ax, a 19 year old teacher, resulting in an injured child. Maybe this is ""literary"" but I don't like it. Does have some interesting themes like an obsession with one's parents mortality, triggers to sexual repression, etc. But overall depressing I thought."
5,Life Changes When You Stop Hiding from Yourself,"Ms. Bender has written a beautiful story about the fear of loss (among other things) and how that fear can stop one from living. I can identify with Mona Gray, and who can't (except for some of the previous reviewers)? Bender makes Mona's inner struggles accessible through strong story telling and striking imagery."
1,This is An Awful Piece of Fiction,"Well, I made it to page 80 and decided to give up. What a boring story, what a boring character, and whata horribly boring style of writing. Not imaginative at all, no energy, no momentum, just tedious flat sentences that took me no where. I abandoned it at page 80 and skimmed the rest and the end and decided, who cares!Why are these books published? I really don't get it.M. Goldstein, NYC"
2,"Unusual, imaginative, but unsatisfying","The premise of the story is interesting. The relationships between adults and children were developed and had depth. While we don't need to take ourselves so seriously, the nuerosis and serious dysfunction that seems to effect the majority of the characters was a little ""overdone"" and grew irritating as the story progressed. This is not a ""literary"" criticism about prose, writing style, etc., I just didn't enjoy this book. Although not without merit, I would wait for the paperback or check it out at the library."
3,Stick with the Skirt,"I probably did this to myself. I read Bender's novel back to back with reading her book of short stories, The Girl In the Flammable Skirt. The problem is this: I feel Bender used lots of the little character quirks she came up with for her short stories in her larger work, the Invisible Sign Of My Own. To me, it was cheating.The book read fairly well, and it was quick and quirky, but what I didn't like about it was that it reused things from other stories, if not directly, at least in spirit. She definitely took the ""knock on wood"" thing from an earlier short story of her own.This all aside, I liked the writing, and felt it really worked well for me."
4,"great replacement, tho a bit pricey","This was almost perfect size to replace the original burnt out heat plates. Didn't think this part would set me back $60 including shipping, but they were the only part of my Costco grill that needed replacement, so I guess it's worth it. Not ready to sink another $400 or more into a new grill."
5,"Beautiful ""Death and Transfiguration""!","James Levine and the MET Orchestra give a performance of Death and Transfiguration that is one of sheer beauty. The last 7-8 minutes are especially ethereal. Perhaps Karajan and Reiner have better known recordings, but this one beats them both (and I'm a BIG Reiner fan.) After hearing Levine's rendition, Karajan's left me flat. The Don Quixote is also exceptional. Great sound in both pieces."
2,Mutter struggles with Sibelius - and loses,"This is one of the worst Sibelius Concertos I've ever heard. Mutter struggles once again with the technical challenges of the piece and comes up short in terms of artistry. Her entrance in I is too muddled, and she slows down too much during technically difficult passages. In this case, her artistic ideas do not serve well in preserving the clash between 'fire and ice' in this piece. I would recommend Sarah Chang's Sibelius Concerto, a far superior recording."
4,Great chess computer,"Let me start with the good points -- it's a very strong computer, with a number of selectable levels starting with level 1 which hangs pieces left and right all the way up to class a/expert strength. The lessons seem interesting, and the audio output is usually pretty good. Unlike the chess software fritz (by chessbase.com) it only says something when it has something useful to say.The bad. Well it's really expensive, and the pieces are a little on the small side. For [the price] I was hoping for atleast a 4"" king, and possibly wood pieces. The pieces are relatively attractive, though. The computer voice does not sound natural, but it is not too bad, and certainly understandable.In short, I would recommend it to any chess fan. Playing on a real chess board is far superior to playing on a 2d computer, and this is one good option to do so. The cost is high, but this computer is strong enough to grow with you (unless you are already a very strong player)."
3,You Don't KNow What YOu've Got Until It's GOne!,"Cinderella was one of the big hair bands in the 1980s and 1990s. It was never as popular as other groups. I was pleasantly surprised by their other songs besides my personal favorite and it's biggest hit, You Don't KNow What You've Got Until It's GOne. The leading voice and the music is typical of the music of it's time. These were the ballad groups where the songs were long but the message was about love and relationships."
5,"works great, great size","I like it very much. It takes a gallon of oil, fryes evenly, it works, I cleaned it, it's not very hard. I like it"
4,Easy to clean! I like it!!,"It's very easy to use and clean as well! No more mess in the kitchen. The only problem we found is that this deep fryer needs lots of oil, so we had hard time to find the container to keep the oil for recycling. We wished a container had come with the deep fryer..."
3,Messy,This product has good and bad aspects. First the good. It stays heated very well and cooks your food crispy and to perfection. It is a very good size for families and looks nice. The bad is that I don't have a dishwasher so it is a bit of a pain to clean. Since it has an immersion heating system you must take that out and clean it by hand even if you do have a dishwasher. Also the one I bought and just received TODAY leaked oil from the bottom. I am not sure if this is just a fluke in the one that I received but I will be sending it back anyway because it is TOO big for just 2 people and a pain in the rear to clean. Overall it is a great machine but not what I was hoping for.
2,with light use broke down in a few months,"Broke down in a few months with little use. It was fine, went o use it one evening, plugged it in and NOTHING. Had to run out and by a diffent brand as the clams were waiting."
2,Not quite what expected.,"1. Used it once. Cooked well but had to move thermostat at least 20 higher to do the job right.2. Used a lot of oil,more than my old Delonghi fryer.3. Very messy & the filter did not impress me.Will go back the the seal lid,round type Delonghi."
2,Kids didn't like it,"Garner made 2 movie for disney. if your on the look out for good family movie that are fun, no cursing or nudity, a little action and a little romance... you want Castaway Cowboy, CC not One Little Indian, OLI.CC is a nice movie about a cowboy that ends up stuck on an island. He shows the nice widow woman how to start a cattle ranch instead of tring to far or fish.OLI is very boring. Not one of my three kids stayed for the end. And isn't that the true test of a movie. It isn't totally what mom or I like, it is also what they will like enough to sit and watch and enjoy."
3,Family movie with favorite actors,"I remember seeing One Little Indian as a kid so I picked it up. There's not much action but a long traveling story. The interesting thing is the list of up and coming stars that were in it.Jay Silverheels (Tonto), Jim Davis from the tv show DallasRobert Pine from CHIPS, James Garner from Rockford Files and of course Jodie Foster.As many Disney films there's some action and sad events in the story. A white boy (Clay O'Brien)who was captured by the indians as a child. Then taken away from his indian ""mother"" whom he wants to get back to. This is a fine family movie for the younger set and for those who want to see the actors before they were famous."
5,Very entertaining movie!,"James Garner portrays a deserting U.S. Cavalry soldier, who has stolen the army's camel and gets saddled with a runaway Indian boy, who turns out to be a white boy raised by Indians, and is trying to get back to his tribe. Their journey is humorous and sometimes poignant, and the two eventually come to an understanding and grow fond of each other. The reason James Garner is running from the Calvary is not given until toward the end of the movie, and it's not what you might expect, and makes you respect his character more. Adventure, drama, suspense, and humor--it's all here and very engaging."
3,I give it this,"It is MUCH better then the first set, ... the first set cramed too much story into too much little time, The 2nd set suffers from Not enough story.But it's still much better then the first one.There where some actual scenes that had me laughing too! and I'm actually starting to care for the characters!But it is still not a great anime, and I still won't give it 4 stars, the series is still only ok/good.If you are a fan of the video game series I think like me you probably liked that tune that played in the starting anime intro to the original Wild Arms game. Yes it is actually heard in the 6th Episode of this series! I was so glade to hear it.Anyways I hope this series improves, but they have gotten a little better in my opinion."
2,"Weak on Substance, pretty pictures","The book is apparently aimed at model builders as it has many full color pictures, but little hard data (for example, how long was this beast? Don't look for it here. What little information is provided is hidden among the text. At the very least a book like this should have several tables of characteristics for each major model. I will not be purchasing anymore of this Osprey series."
1,this cd sucks,"I wasn't impressed with this album at all. I bought it, opened it up, listened to it, then I traded it to one of my friends for a three six mafia cd. Don't waste your money on it."
2,weak,the beats arent as tight as before.... it's not as hard as before....i was expecting something like loaded or season of da siccness... this album makes you want to advocate file sharing..so atleast you can hear something before you buy it...and that DVD???? wow.... disappointment
3,"Interesting, but not the easiest to read","I learned a great deal from this book, but the first half seemed to have a lot of repetition in it. It is not a light read, but it is well researched. Alexander does not come off as much of a sympathetic figure, so when he dies there is not much of a sense that the world had lost a great man -- maybe in his exploits, but that is about it.If you are expecting a fascinating biography of this man, you may want to look elsewhere."
3,Early classics outshine the recent hits,"DelaSoul is an important band in Hip Hop and deserving of a greatest hits compilation. I was a big fan of their first two records and I lost track of them after that. Naturally, I'm biased towards the early songs in their career. Songs like ""Me, Myself, and I"", ""Ring Ring Ring,"" ""Saturdays,"" and ""Buddy"" are my favorite songs. I have a tougher time with the songs from their later period. Part of it is due to my unfamiliarity with the songs, and part of it is due to all the guest rappers on their biggest hits. The beats are fine, but I want to hear DelaSoul, not a bunch of guest rappers. So many hip hop groups fall into the trap of guest rappers to help boost sales, and I guess I'm a little disappointed DelaSoul did the same. A fan of hip hop, and especially recent hip hop music, will enjoy all of this compilation. I'm satisfied only listening to their early tunes."
2,Does not work,"I installed it and within 15 minutes, the sparrows were building their nest in it, even with the wooden inserts in place, to raise the floor. So, save your money. I'll be doing some more research to try to keep these pests out, after they have just raided the blue birds nest in my old blue bird house."
1,Don't buy this sweetner!!!,"I was so excited to purchase somersweet. Her book(Eat, Cheat, and Melt the Fat Away) states on pg. 25 ""And, unlike aspertame or saccarin, somersweet is chemical-free...""REALLY?? Why does the ingredients say Acesilfame K? That is A CHEMICAL THAT CAUSES CANCER!!Either she is a liar, or doesn't even know the ingredients in her own product. Very disappointed!"
2,"Great expectations, great disappointment...","I have done quiet a bit of research on the net before I ordered this book, just so I get the best one. It looked just the book for me to start learning Swing. (I know Java already). When I looked through the book I was shocked to see that it was little more than a doorstop. Gutz is one of those few gifted individuals who really knows what he's talking about. BUT doesn't know how to explain it clearly. Apart from his coding style and the last two chapters this book rushes through every aspect of swing with very little to say about all parts of Swing. If you are looking for a book that will REALLY help you learn Swing, I recommend you take your hard earned cash elsewhere. I am returning it. And make a decision probably between the Sun's tutorial and Matthew Robinson's Swing book."
4,Great up-and-running book,"The book takes you from a basic understanding of Java's AWT to a basic understanding of Java's new Swing.The only real things missing are that the author glosses over too many of the Swing methods too quickly, and that he misses much of the Swing hierarchy.It quickly gets through a few basics and into a few very useful classes, but I guess I'm also looking for a good, thick reference guide(s) as well."
3,Communication overload,"This book was too verbose. As I read the book, I caught myself wanting to tell the author to just get to the point. Most of the book is also very anecdotal, which I thought was overused. Overall, the book presents some interesting topics but I wouldn't suggest it for someone who sought general information on qualitative research methods."
1,Wrong Picture- Wrong Item,"The item was received promptly after being ordered, but the picture that was displayed with the item was incorrect and therefore I received a different item than the picture indicated. I tried to contact the owner and no one ever returned my emails even after trying about four times. I received a 2002 product and should have gotten a new 2010 product. I was very upset with my purchase!"
2,Hold Out for An Improve Release,"I was really excited to find this on DVD. That excitement ended when I viewed the disc. My VHS copy I made from the original TV airing is better quality. Sure some of the songs are missing, but it views but better, and all the intros are included."
3,Expected a love story,I expected to read a love story but did not find one. Do you other women see this as a LOVE story? It is a lust story. It was enjoyable and good if you are visually inclined. I could not put it down because I wanted to find out what was going to happen.
1,Cheap made in China JUNK,"The metal on this cap is thin and soft.The upper, outer too small to create a good seal, seeps on a brand new radiator"
1,Don't waste your money,This thing will eat through batteries. Have to buy new ones at least once a week. If you buy rechargeable they will last 2 to 3 days. I think this is because it is sound activated.
3,Pain in the tooshie...,"Lots of things I like about it- easy to attach to crib, sweet to look at, good varieties of programs. I enjoy the music selections as well.Cons- as soon as I got it- the lightbulb for the ceiling show faded out and is impossible to replace. First off it is very difficult to find the correct replacement bulb, second once you take the bulb out of the unit, it is very difficult to get back in. Then I thought perhaps it was a battery issue. Tried new ones, didn't help. The instructions in the online manual didn't help.I too, found this product to be too squeaky to be able to focus on the music. If I ever get the light fixed on it, perhaps I'll try and fix that as well. But no product should be this much work. It's unique and a great concept, but has a lot of room for improvement."
4,Wonderful crib soother,"We had the Fisher Price Aquarium crib attachment, but the motor went out before it was even 4 months old. I searched around and found the V Tech and we LOVE it. I still need to see how long it lasts, but the price is quite affordable, so I wouldn't mind replacing it once or twice. I love the ceiling projection and the ability to set the duration of play. My husband loves the sound sensor which will turn the melody on when it senses baby sounds for a couple of seconds. I also like that this product can be used on a crib or a dresser and it comes preloaded with batteries. Just take it out of the box and it is ready to go."
1,Big disappointment,Bought this for my 6 month grandson. Worked about 1 week & then quit. Have changed batteries but still doesn't work. Guess it was too good to be true! Spend your money on another crib toy.
4,une grande voix du passé ...,"L'approche est classique. L'auditeur ressent que Fournier peutdémonter un souci d'émotion en plus de la technique.Par moment, son jeu me semble un peu sur-controlé, ce qui pourrait inciter à comparer à d'autres versions.Néanmoins, un classique des suites de Bach."
2,not worth the price,Pros:1)strait-forward menue and easy learning curve2)Bright screen and clear voiceCons:1)price tag not justified w/o text-to-voice feature2)Slow response in re-routing3)Lose signal frequently in NYC4)Giving wrong directions quite often5)Might force you to a ten-block u-turn (in stead of rerouting)6)May run you up against lots of one-ways (in NYC at least)...
3,Megellan Roadmate 3000T,"The screen and layout is great, only problem i have with the roadmate as if i use it when going somewhere over 100 miles it will lock up and i have to turn unit off and restart which can be a pain at times."
2,A spastic GPS,"The best thing about the Magellean 3000T is the large screen.Sometimes this gadget works like a charm--other times it just seems to pay no attention. Actually, the touch screen function decides not to work. You can sit there and touch, rub, hammer; to no avail. I got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to Amazon. First, I called Magellan's help line (the phone number was hard to find); apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon. If you hear a click, it's okay. Finally it works most of the time. Damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration."
1,Flatware leaves dark grey marks on Pfaltzgraff dishes - don't buy,"I have owned a full set of Pfaltzgraff Grapevine dishes for over 10 years. After using them everyday for about five years, I noticed gray marks on the dishes where ever metal flatware touches them. This didn't happen when they were new and doesn't happen to the pieces that I use infrequently. Pfaltzgraff knows about the problem and even sells a cleaner to get rid of the marks but they show up the very next time you use them!Don't buy these if you are looking to invest in a set of dishes that will look nice for years to come!"
5,To the people who gave this novel a bad review...,"Wow... I can't believe what people said about this book.. I am the worst reader ever.. I hate it with a passion.. But I had to read this book for my Grade 12 Independant Study Project. I was dreading reading it, but i was hooked as soon as i opened it. I truly feel for people when they go through struggles, especially in this case of being separated from their families, and for someone to call this book crap? How would you like to write a novel that is not only ""better"", but express yourself and share your pain with the world and have people like yourself call it crap.I actually hate to read but this is one book I am glad i did. It made me look at Canada completely differently, and realize that we are not so perfect after all. I hope we have finally learn from our past for once."
5,Obasan,"I chose this novel to include in my thesis for my Master's degree in Writing because it covers a very important topic in western literature: women's lives. It is well written according to academic standards and, in addition to its focus on the interment of Japanese families, it well describes Japanese family life from the women's point of view. I liked learning the intimate culture that guides these families, their loving care of each member and their unique positive philosophy which remained their strength in the face of tremendous indignities. Fascinating reading."
1,"i found this to be one of the slowest, shallowest reads ever","this book had no point, little character development, no ending and very little message to it. I realize that having your family split up is very painful,but she isn't the only one in the world that has had this happen. Get over it! Terrible book"
3,Central Line CD,"This CD brings back memories of the early 80s. My absolute favorite song on this CD is ""Walking into Sunshine--Larry Levan Mix."" It's too bad Central Line was and is a virtually unknown group. They made good music."
1,Item does not work,I cannot say how disappointed I was with this buy. Open it on christmas to a non charging battery....poor present to say the least. didnt even charge once.
1,Trying so save a buck,You can buy a generic battery for $25 or a Dell for $65. Well I decided to try cheap. The battery lasted half way through installing windows. Now it has enough juice to get halfway through the BIOS.
3,Dell Battery review,I purchased the Dell battery through Amazon and as usual Amazon did a fantastic job by delivering it on time. The battery was in good condition and I could use it right away. It works how I expected it to so no complaints!Sandeep
1,laptop battery,"didnt work must of been defective , and why do you need so many words to make this work ahhhhh"
3,Functional but nerdy,"My physically disabled son using a dot on his glasses to manipulate a mouse emulator (i.e. Head Mouse) to use his computer, and this item purchased to keep his glasses snuggly in place. It works well, except that his hair gets caught in the hardware. I also think that it is very ""nerdy"". I will have to make a cool cover for it, maybe a black leather tube, to slip it through to solve both the looks and the hair tangling."
4,glasses strap,Flents Sports Band - Elastic Eyeglass Holder for Active PeopleVery utilitarian-good for physical activities but they are small.
4,Cannot Find These Locally in NE Ohio.,">>>>>Nobody here locally has these type of sports bands--what's more is that they do not even know what these are when I inquired. And to think the last one of these I purchased was only a little over 3 years ago. Shucks, even places that make and sell glasses on site do not know what these type bands are. I like these over the elastic tubing the optical departments are pushing and their prices are outlandish. All in all, I am well satisfied that I was able to locate what I really wanted. I have been wearing this style of glass holder for some almost 30 years now--when the tubing types were not even known of back then. Lastly this Flents sports band is also a fantastic deal as they want upwards of $6.00 -- even at Wally World !!! Find this product: ..."
2,a la carte,"Just opened the first of two cases of 11 1/4"" dinner plates and to my disappointment,three of the four plates have noticable flaws. The rims of two plates are quite wobbly in appearance, one plate has a bubble in the glaze and on one other plate,the glaze is dull and rough. This is my first purchase of a Pfaltzgraff product,and I would not purchase plates again unless I could inspect each one first. I strongly doubt these are first quality."
3,You DO need tools to install!,"You need a flat head screwdriver and wrench. It specifically mentions the wrench in the instructions. I found there was no hand tightening involved at all. It was all wrench work. Pretty easy to figure out, but I actually had to mount this backwards from what it said, due to our large german shepherd wanting a drink, I found out that the flip latch is actually stronger than the side that is supposed to stay put (for tilting when cleaning). Looks nice, but we'll see how it holds up."
1,Very cheap and plastic,The bowl and mounting system are very flimsy. I installed it on a flat railing...but when I put water in it the bowl swayed and bent and spilled water out.
4,Nice for bigger birds,"I purchased this to replace a smaller, also deck-mounted birdbath. I knew it was 20"" but I guess I didn't realize how BIG a 20"" diameter birdbath is. My husband said, ""what birds are bathing here - geese?"" It would be nicer if it had a little shallow shelf-like area for the smaller birds to bathe. It's 2"" deep, nice for the robins but the finches are hesitant. I kept the smaller birdbath up for the little guys."
4,Satisfied customer,I've had the heater now for over a month. I use it to heat a large bedroom attached to our house. Once it heats up it throws more than adequate heat and serves the purpose for which it was intended.Overall I am satisfied with this purchase.
2,weak heater,Very dis-satisfid. Takes forever to notice any heat difference. Forever ='s 3 hours. Also smells like hot oil which is unpleasant!!
4,Delivery speed....,[ DeLonghi EW7707CM Safeheat 1500W ComforTemp Portable Oil-Filled Radiator]All I know so far is I ordered this product and several others through Amazon and []with their other sellers and this Space Heater bought directly from Amazon was here before I knew it. I was prized to see Fed EX at my door. I am burning the coating they say is on the heater off. I don't see any or feel anything but the instructions said to do it so I have it outside on high for a few hours. Don't forget to download your $10 free gift certificate that came with this product.
2,Not worth the money,"This worked pretty well the first month I had it. It did not do as good a job heating a room as older portable radiators I have, but did a good enough job on the highest setting.Now, a little over a month later, it only seems to work on the highest setting - the coils don't even get warm on the lower settings.Too expensive to even consider shipping back.Please don't waste your time with this model."
2,Waste of Money,Tried to heat up our living room by leaving the heater on overnight. It only made a difference of 2 degrees. Would not recommend this to anyone. We donated it to someone who needed to heat a small space. It would have cost too much to send back.
3,Good buy,"Pros: extremely quietit can warm up a room, fersherCon: Sometimes it seems it takes a lloooooong time to heat up. It doesn't seem consistent to me. Once it's on a while, the room definitely is warm... but sometimes it just seems like it's taking its sweet time... and other times it seems to work quickly. Weird. But when it's good it's good."
4,delonghi oil filled heater,"I bought this heater for additional heat in the basement. We keep it set on high 24hrs because of the large amount of space to heat. It runs an extra $20 a month to operate. It definately makes a difference and keeps the area nice and warm. Definately would reccommend, Ive tried others."
4,DeLonghi radiator works fine,"This heater was purchased for the heating season, because we will be augmenting our oil-fired boiler by keeping the thermostat lower and spot-heating rooms that we are working in. We chose this for the kitchen, and so far it is working well. It doesn't heat up fast, but the heat lingers after you turn it off, and we felt good about the safety devices built into the unit. So far, it is a good addition, but we will know more about its effectiveness during January, when things get really cold!"
3,DeLonghi EW7707CM Heater,"Had about a month, no problems so farPros: Reasonable Price, Looks Nice, Quiet, Wheels Make Moving EasyCons: Takes A While To Warm Up, Controls Somewhat Complicated (too many setting and switches), Wish It Produced More HeatJury still out, let's see how long it last"
5,"nice, quiet, consistent heat","I bought this heater to replace a small ceramic heater. My ceramic heater did a nice job heating the bedroom, but created a lot of noise clicking on and off throughout the night. To get the most enjoyable use out of my new DeLonghi heater, I must turn it on about an hour before I'm ready for bed. I also keep it on the ""ComfortTemp"" setting to prevent the on/off clicking noise. It did take about 1 week for me to figure out the temperature controls (there's min, med, and max, plus a thermostat setting of 1-6). I can't just say ""70 degrees"" like on the thermostat that controls my furnace! Overall I am very pleased with this product, I appreciate the heat that it puts out and I hope it lasts me a long time."
4,Good for small rooms not big rooms,This one is excellent but only for small rooms. My bedroom is 16*11 and this one completely fails to warm up the room. I had to buy a radiant based headter and used along with this one.
4,good heat -- could use better thermostat,"The radiator works well and heats our room nicely and evenly. The settings on the radiator are thermostat controlled (the setting corresponds to the room's air temperature, not to the radiator's heat output). That's great -- but what's missing is an indication of what temperature the settings actually correspond to (it just has numbers from 1-6). For instance, it has this ""ComforTemp"" setting which is supposed to automatically set the ""right"" temperature for you. But it gives no indication (on the unit or in the manual) what that ""right"" temperature actually is. I'm using it to heat my baby's room at night to keep it a bit warmer than the rest of the house -- and so it is important to know approximately what temperature it is set to so she doesn't get too hot or too cold. With trial and error, I have been able to determine the correct settings, but it could have been made easier."
2,The head is barely useable.,"This is a very good tripod for the money. The only problem is the 3-way head. It has too much slack. Once you angle the camera in the direction you want, tighten the handle, it will settle a few degrees more down or to the side. It also does not have a mark for the horizontal position, so it's hard to align the camera to the horizontal plane. It will lean a few degrees to the left. Even the cheapest plastic tripods I've seen have a sturdier head."
3,Engineering Could Be Better - Head Assembly Came Apart,"I had this tripod for little over a year and used it exclusively indoors (still in like new condition). Functionally it worked well though the locked positions didn't always hold as tightly as I expected.Overall I was satified until just recently when I pulled it out to do some shooting. I started to move the head when it suddenly disassembled. Apparently the three screws that attached it were no longer secure.I took apart the head by removing the plastic cover and unscrewing the mount. Needless to say what I found inside was indicative of poor engineering and what looks like a stop gap solution. There is a loose metal square (very uneven) that is put in to keep a bolt in position, secondly the three screws are so short that they barely grip the thread when tightened. At this price level I expect well machined parts and some thought given to the correct screw length."
2,Peppermint Oil Softgels,I don't think I'll continue to take these because I really didn't see any results after almost a month .
2,homelite backpack blower,"This never ran well. The fuel line was installed poorly - I had to change it because it did not go deep enough into the tank and after a half tank of gas, would start to stall. Also, the carb never worked right and does not hold rpm steady. Spend a little more, get a little more..."
4,"When I wasn't on the edge of my seat, I was sliding off it","Engrossing tale of a Chicago cop caught between the 'right thing' and a possible 'better life'. Written by a retired Chicago cop, the situations and dialogue ring true and keep you guessing until the end."
4,solide Arbeit,"Das Buch ist eine gute Arbeit mit kleinen Schwächen, die hauptsächlich auf dürftiges Quellenmaterial zurückzuführen sind. Wenn man über eine Epoche schreibt, die einige hundert Jahre zurück liegt, wird es immer Raum für Interpretationen geben."
2,"Silly, but sweet romp","Harry is adorable and so is Plum, but the story is seriously flawed. The children are annoying, not cute. In fact you really wish they would conveniently disappear with a governess so you can concentrate on the main characters. The mystery takes too long to develop and then the main characters brush it off as unimportant. (Death threats and kidnappings are somehow less important than scandal) The ending is rushed and hardly explained."
5,Another winner from Katie MacAlister!,"This book is wonderful! It dares to stray from the typical romance heroine with Plum, a 40 year old woman with a heart of gold. She marries Harry, a widower with five rambunctious children, and becomes the glue that holds the family together. The story includes the wit and hilarity that is typically found in a Katie MacAlister book. I loved it and have been encouraging friends to read it too!"
4,This is book used for mini-MBA/Certificate of Management programs,"I just received this book so I cannot comment on it's content. I can say, however, that this book saved me three thousand dollars. I did a ""test drive"" of the Certificate of Management Program offered at the University of Texas at Dallas. Turns out all (or most) of the Program is simply going through this book. Their program is 15 sections, this book is 15 chapters. Their program uses all the videos and quizzes from the DVD that comes with this book. They're basically selling you this textbook and a certificate at a 10,000% (ten thousand percent) markup. Yikes!I am just looking for knowledge, not another credential, so I don't need the school to certify that I've read this book by giving me another certificate to hang on the wall. I'm using it to lay a foundation for my Personal MBA (see Josh Kaufman's website). So, if you simply want to learn some business basics, and you don't need a resume bullet, buy this book or one like it."
5,Excellent book to learn network programming,"I have tried learning network programming from Orfali's client/server programming with Java and CORBA, but that book was hard to understand. This book is concise and gets to the point. I love it. I have learned a lot from it. It is surely worth the money."
4,"Good book about RMI, sockets programming","I bought two books at the same time when I start to learn rmi. One is this book, another one is ""java.rmi Guide"".Before I start, the second one seems more attractive as its name implies,so I decided to use ""java.rmi Guide"" as the main book, use the Distributed programming with Java only as a reference, but when I start learning, I read the ""java.rmi Guide"", I was totally lost, the book full of concepts with few examples.So finally, I spent most of my time on ""Distributed programming in Java"" because this book not only explains the concepts very clearly, but also gives out many good examples. At least, when I read it and run the codes in this book, I know what I am doing and why.As some readers suggested: maybe the java.rmi Guide is good for experienced, but not for beginners.For beginners who want to learn RMI and CORBA, ""Distributed Programming with Java"" is the most appropiate book for them."
2,"Brief, too brief","I am currently going thru this book on the chapters on distributed computing. The examples given in this book are too simple and brief. Although it helps to introduce and provide a simple guide to the CORBA topics, after a couple of hours later, I find that it is too brief and frankly it lacks substance.Quite disapointed."
4,Pretty good,"Got this item for a Panasonic AE-1000U. It is mounted directly to the ceiling and screwed into rafters above the drywall (although you can mount it onto a pipe.) Its not the easiest to adjust, but it is relatively inexpensive and once you get it pointed in the right direction, it locks down tight and keeps the projector fixed.The thing I really like is that it mounts the projector very close to the ceiling."
2,heavy vacuum,"This vacuum cleaner, like most today, seems very heavy and bulky to me.Hard to maneuver, but it does pick up OK on both wood floors and carpet.I'm disappointed in it because I thought Electrolux would have made somethinga little lighter and better quality, but it does the job."
1,A Big Disappointment - Don't Be Fooled,"While there are a handful of useful stretches and poses demonstrated on this DVD, they are presented in a rushed and random manner, cheating the viewer out of the benefits of a real workout. If all you want is a quick stretch before teeing off, this DVD can help, but so can a fitness article in any golf magazine--and for a lot less money.If you want a total yoga workout that'll tone your mind and body for golf (or any other physical activity), I recommend LIVINGarts Total Yoga."
1,not what you think,"I am really dissapointed in this DVD. She explains all the moves, but your are left on your own to do them. You have to pause the DVD after each pose so you can count your 10 breaths and then continue on to the next pose. Not at all what I wanted."
5,Mr. Hurwitz is Wrong !!,"Can a recording truly be as bad as Mr. Hurwitz states in his review? I have listened to these recordings twice through and I think they are excellent !! I own other Tchaikovsky Symphony sets conducted by Abbado, Bernstein, Jansons, Karajan and Abravanel. I also have Symphonies 4-6 with Dutoit and Ormandy. While I believe that the Jansons set is by far the best, this set by Pletnev is definitely very good. I'm sorry that some people believe that, in order for a new recording of old music to be great, it has to be radically different from all previous recordings. These symphonies are well conducted, well played and, most importantly, well recorded. Sorry, there are no surprise wild tempo shifts although there are some rather pleasant dynamics differences from other recordings. A truly enjoyable listening experience!!"
3,La vie est belle -- Life is Beautiful; Andre Rieu,"Recorded at Waldbühne Berlin, this video is very highly rated for musicianship and choice of beautiful music, but videographer Karl Müller ought to spend the rest of his days in isolated rehab. There is very little time spent on any particular frame of video. It is more like the editor is on a heavy trip with speed, given the nearly constant pan, zoom, fade in and out, jump frentically from scene to scene, and attempts to cover every member of this brilliant orchastra and chorus, and most members of the audience, on every piece of beautiful music. Such shabby editing detracts from an otherwise terrific album; listen to it closely, but don't waste any time looking at it. Something else missing, besides mature editing, is the participation by the always gorgeous and talented sopranos Carmen Monarcha and Carla Maffioletti, either or both of whom would certainly make the title worthy of being called Life is Beautiful. They are not featured at all."
2,"sad, really!","the pinto horse is covered in scratches, his ears are also slightly chipped. the cow girl doll is very pretty, excepther hands are covered in gray paint some how! the saddle is well-made and durable but the stirrups are extremely un-even.and the bridle broke the first time i put it on the horse. the saddle pad is the only piece that has nothing wrong with it.sadly, my daughte threw away the box this came with. she says she is very disappointed at the horrible quality of something manufactured by breyer.and she "" demands to get a refund!"" she personally doesn't recommend this product to any persons."
4,SUPRISINGLY GOOD HORROR/WESTERN!!!,"AT THE START, I DID NOT EXPECT THIS FILM TO BE ALL THAT GREAT.IT DID, HOWEVER, TURN OUT TO BE QUITE INTERESTING.THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF BLOOD AND VIOLENCE, BUT WHAT WOULD A WESTERN BE WITHOUT IT?IF YOU'RE INTO OLD-STYLE WESTERNS, THEN DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.IF YOU'RE INTO CLINT EASTWOOD STYLE VIOLENT WESTERN THRIILLERS, THEN YOU MIGHT JUST ENJOY THIS.THERE WERE A FEW RECOGNIZABLE FACES IN THE FILM, BUT NO BIG NAME STARS.IT IS, HOWEVER, A VERY GOOD WESTERN WITH LOTS OF BLOOD AND A TITLE CHARACTER WITH A COOL BLACK OUTFIT, A DEFORMED FACE AND A QUIET PERSONALITY.HIS SHOOTING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF!!!ALL IN ALL, THIS WAS A MOVIE THAT I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IF YOU LIKE NEW WESTERNS WITH ALL THE BLOOD AND GUNSHOTS THAT ONE COULD ASK FOR IN A FEATURE FILM. ENJOY!!!"
4,Chairs are nice for price,"The chairs arrived in a timely manner and look nice, although they had to be assembled first. Just make sure you get all of your screws and bolts evenly tightened to avoid wobble.. We had to use a vice to hold the seat in place to screw on as there were no screw holes in that piece of the chair."
1,Hard to ignore the complete bias of the author and lack of editor,The author raises some great points but fails to deliver a good message as the chapters drown themselves in political ramblings. Also check out page 88 where the author and editors confuse Andrew Jackson and Stonewall Jackson. Hard to take the author's message serious.
1,Cane,I did not like this book at all. It was boring and I did not really understand it because it was like reading more than one book at the same time. It felt like that because the author kept jumping back and forth to to different subjects. There was also a lot of poetry in the book wich made it more confusing.
4,Better than the Romantic Times Magazine rating!,"The other reviewer said it all very well. I just want to add that Romantic Times magazine gave this book a ""2"" which it did not deserve! It was very well written and I especially liked the military history. It was an interesting and enjoyable read. The hero and heroine are worthy of praise especially as they finally come to their senses and acknowledge true love!"
4,A Good CD,"I don't usually like rap music, but I was impressed by this CD. It has a good beat and interesting lyrics. Also, the artist is a homegrown Minnesotan - refreshing!"
1,Size Matters,"Buyer Beware! This item is not the size specified on the Website ""Product Dimensions: 5.9 x 5.5 x 3.4 inches ; 4.6 pounds"" This is over 6 1/4"" deep and will not fit in an Aspire Cube type case if you have anything in the drive bays. It will have to be returned..."
5,"Easy install, Long wires","I got this Power Supply because I wanted to get a better Graphics Card. While I haven't gotten the new Card yet, this PSU is great.I love the Thermaltake brand. Their products are top quality and not too expensive.This particular PSU has crazy long wires. It has a very good amount of connectors. It's pretty quiet and stays cool. This PSU is a great choice for anybody who wants to make sure they'll have the power to make their computer run faster, mainly for Graphics Card purposes but will also help with demanding CPUs.One negative: This has 2 SATA connectors which is great, but they're right next to each other. In my case, the Disc Drive and HDD use SATA connectors. Those components are too far apart for both SATA connectors to be utilized. As a result, I had to get an adapter from the 4 pin connector to a SATA connector.You can get these adapters for $2 on Amazon, so it's not a huge deal at all though."
2,Dead On Arrival,"I ordered this power supply based on mostly favorable reviews here and at another site. Also, almost two years ago, I ordered one of these at another site for a friends computer in which the PSU had committed hari-kiri. That one has seen a lot of use and has worked flawlessly, so based on that, in the interest of fairness, I am giving this PSU two stars. I have just RMA'ed the one I purchased for a refund. It has the feel of a quality unit, aka heavy. Heavier is usually better with power supplies, indicating a quality build. It has plenty of connectors and all of the current connectors, all of quality construction. Not sure if Thermaltake's quality control has slipped, although if there is one unit in a hundred of an item that is a dud, I will get it everytime."
5,Quality Product,I'm using this in my entertainment system computer. No problem installing this PS and it provides plenty of clean power. Build quality looks very good. I recommend this product.
4,Cheap and does the job,"Installed in a HTPC and works fine. A lot of cables (may be too many). As another reviewer mentioned, the 2 sata power connectors can be used only if the drives are close to each other. I had to use an extra adapter to get 2 more sata connectors ."
5,Works exactly as intended.,"Latches were quite easy to install and work as exactly as they are supposed to. My 10-month-old daughter was very angry with me after she was no longer able to open the cabinet doors as she usually does on her daily trip around the kitchen. Frustrated babies are funny, haha. Buy for comic relief."
2,Not as user friendly as advertised,"I'm old school, as in trained on mutlitrack tape recording live classical & acoustic performances. While this software is great for the techno-geek with electronica in every corner of the studio, this is not user friendly, has poor edit functions, and has a built-in ""auto-shutdown"" mechanisim that's a real pain in the you-know-what.When trying to edit pre-recorded performances -ie, from analog tape or digital sources, I cannot find any instructions on mixing, editing, and combining tracks into a seamless finished recording. The instructions are written for metered, digital loops, not continuous playing tracks.So, in all, if you record and mix/master ""loops"" and little songs, this software is excellent. But, if you're working with a piano concerto, I'd rethink purchasing this product."
4,One fatal problem,I got everything fine. Came really quick! They sent me Mixcraft 3 though. Still not bad
2,Great for kids,"I wish the beads were included as stated throughout the book. However, the seller DID SAY it was only the book.The book was written for 8-12 yr olds, but did give very a basic history for Egyptian beadwork. If you just want easy beadwork patterns for the pre-teen, this is it.It was shipped quickly."
2,Well worth the money.,"As a beginner in learning Persian, this book has been a lot of help. I like the simplified approach, the flash cards, the repetetive exercises and the activities that emphasize the 100 words. This book also helped me learn the complex Persian alphabet which is so different from the English alphabet. Granted 100 words is a small vocabulary in any language - but it is 100 words I did not know before! If you are above a beginner in Persian, this probably is not the book for you."
1,"for learning script, not for speaking, no pronunciation help!","This book focuses on teaching the script, and gives absolutely no help with pronunciation, which is the hardest thing about learning farsi for ""total beginners."" There are no dictionary pronunciation symbols or similar sounding words as examples -- I mean, really, NO PRONUNCIATION HELP AT ALL. You need to have a persian friend sitting with you, teaching you pronunciation as you go through this book, otherwise you will be laughed at when you try to speak. the book says it has ""pronunciation tips,"" but they don't exist. the authors should look at a dictionary to see how pronunciation is conveyed in text."
3,english dub destroys the original japanese script,"i think this dvd series is better when you watch it in japanese with english subtitles. for some reason, the producers of the dvd thought it would be better to make the desert punk an outrageously perverted and foul mouthed character. even the other characters curse more in english than they did in japanese. the story even makes more sense with the english subtitles. i guess someone thought the story would be better if they completely rewrote the script. in my opinion they need to stick to the japanese translation. that's true for just about every instance of anime out there. azumanga daioh is another good example of someone killing an excellent anime with a bad english script and voice acting."
5,Wonderful,"This is a great concert. I am looking forward to seeing Andre in person next time he comes to our area.This is my second DVD on his concerts. Each concert is around 2hrs. One of the best and most relaxing times to clear your mind, relax from everyday stresses."
3,"Disappointing, but for the Best Reasons","The performance maintains Rieu's high standard. The problem is that the DVD is only 58 minutes long. Compare that to the Vienna DVD which is over 2 hours long. If you are a Rieu fan, as I am, you want more. For the money, you should get more."
1,This movie is sooooo lame.,"One of the worst bigfoot movies ever made, this has every bigfoot cliche'. The man in the monkey suit looks like a man in a monkey suit, the plot is totally predictable, and it stars one of the ""Home Improvement"" brats. All the makings of a big-budget made-for-TV bust."
3,book good - problem with vendor,For some unknown reason I was sent two copies of this book - (I only ordered one). they came seperately and I was charged for both and also charged shipping and handling for both. It will cost me too much in shipping to bother returning the second unwanted book. So I'm stuck with it. I don't know if I will order this way again. It is too much of a bother to rectify any mistakes. I prefer dealing directly with Amazon.
3,A good bottle keeper,"for those bottles which do not fall out of the ring, or are not too large for the ring. For those which DO fit well, this keeps the bottle from falling on the floor and is helpful especially in the car if it can be attached to the carseat."
4,Praxis2 study guide,"This book never actually made it to my house, but after sending an email asking where it was, Amazon replied quickly and I received a full refund. There were very cooperative and helpful."
5,Should be given to every girl at puberty,"Wonderful book, not very politically correct though. What I really loved about this book is that it provided a framework on how to be, rather than a detailed list of rules. It seemed to recommend easing into ones natural state with time rather than a indefinite charade. I regularly re-read it to help with my dating practices."
3,Good,"I bought this 8 years ago, and don;t use it anymore. It's an old version and I am looking forward to an update. No. I will not hold my breath. haha."
3,Alright volume,"I'm a huge fan of family guy, been watching it since the beginning. I find this volume half and half, some episodes are funny and some are not that funny. I only recommend this volume if you already own all of the other ones. $30 for 13 episodes is a total rip off. I wish Seth would release family guy in seasons like he did with seasons 1 and 2."
3,Family Guy Volume 6,"Disappointed....I really am. Not as funny and edgy. Cost is too high, and I do NOT like the way they split the season and then charge you a small fortune for the volume. It had its moments of being funny, but I believe that there were too many episodes in volume 6 that just were not good! What more can I say!?"
3,Worst year in the volumes,"Not that great, and would not tell someone to get this one first if you are starting your collection. Try the first season"
4,Family Guy vol 6,"Great show ofc, though I was dissappointed that disc three only had 1 episode on it, kind of a tease."
2,mostly only good for a cheap laugh,I agree with most of the lower reviews on the new family guy episodes. They just aren't as good. Peter used to be a really lovable character but now hes just way overdone. It seems like there's no more wit in the show anymore but just shock value jokes.
1,Not Happy,"I purchased this inexpensive product to use in a small room. The sound was mediocre at best, but had terrible problems with the door opening properly on the unit. I recently just threw the whole thing out over spending hours working on it.Would not recommend this brand."
2,Dont' waster your money,"The system only has the dvd surround sound, there are no other inputs for sound to be directed to the surround sound. DVD player ONLY! The wires for the front right and left speaker are a tad short. The rear speaker stopped working shortly after I got the unit. So don't waste your time .. spend a little more money and get a better system."
3,returnable,"FIrst one I purchased the DVD player broke a bout a month into it, IF you know where all your paperwork is the return policy is good, kinda pokey but good. You get what you pay for. The sound is great though"
1,Keep shopping for something else!,"I (unfortunately) just got one of these. I spent two days trying to get the wireless and dial-up internet connections to work - to no avail. I also spent two hours on hold to their technical support, and waited a full day to have email returned. It automatically shut down at least twelve times in two days. Terribly slow compared to a Dell. I finally shipped it back. So, if you want a reliable wireless connection, or just a reliable computer, keep shopping for something else."
1,Pfalzgraff flatware,"We ordered 2 sets of this product. We love it, except the end pieces come off in the dishwasher. Is there a warrenty on this product? I see they are unavailable."
2,For Giants Only...,"I purchased this item and did not even open it. I'm sure the quality is fine without my touching it but one look at the dinner fork and I knew this would not be the flatware set I would purchase. I went to Bed Bath & Beyond and for [money more ([money]), you can get a really stylish set of silverware. My main problem was due to the dinner fork; it was so large that I would only use it if I was over 7 feet tall. Imagine a short woman using this fork and the fork would be as big as her nose and mouth.This set I'm sure is a fine quality set, and the style is not that bad. But I wouldn't recommend it as a purchase without your going to a store and making sure you like the set you're purchasing."
1,too loose,I agree with the previous reviewer. I tried these on at the Clarks' store and found them way too floppy. The straps are too loose and they just won't stay on. It feels like you're walking around with small life preservers lashed loosely to your feet. Pass on this style and try another version of Clarks Indigo footwear -- the rest are great!
4,Very Fun,"whenever i get sick of all my video games, this is one game i always turn to to play.it's fun, with a dorkey little plot about the evil mini's taking over the M&M; plant.anyways, this game gets really hard!and the graphics suck, but it's playable.and the opening levels ROCK! when you drive around in a car.extra lives are so easy to get! you get like 20 in each level!this game is long too!i've never beaten it because i always start over everytime a play it!the one fault thay knocked off a star is that you die randomly sometimes. rarely you die for absolutely no reason!!sometimes you can walk through something that is sopossed to kill you but doesn't. very funny! you can play for hours and hours without stopping! a must buy playstation game for a cheap price!"
4,perfect product,"Very good product, I suggest it for people like me that need save data with resonable cost."
2,Very basic,"The Author goes straight forward and considers all relevent issues concerning the web. Its very easy to read and summaries occur twice on every single page. It hardly covers any topic in depth. His proposals concerning migration into the e-bizz are shallow and most of them are very general without authentic examples. This book is fast to read through, but the useful information start in the thrid chapter and sum up to a single line per chapter. I am also missing new and detailed proposals and inspirations, could be written some five years ago."
5,Incredible beyond words...,"We are so used to our politicians saying and doing things for their own advancement that it is incomprehensible these days that a speech like the one Robert Kennedy gave to a poor, black, inner city audience could even happen. Whenever I forget that ""life is short and time is precious"", which can happen often in today's world, I will watch this again and realize that there really was someone who spoke healing words and had courage and toughness, but who lived by the Greek poetry he quoted here...""to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world""."
2,No para todo estilo,"No es mi estilo, sin embargo hay que aceptar que el tiene buena voz, seria genial si fuera mas original."
5,Good book for entry level,"From this book, you can learn both computer hardware and softwore such as LC-2 programming and introduction to C program. I taught this class in the university for 2 semesters already. At the very beginning, maybe you will think it's hard, but after that, you will find the book is very useful even after you become professional.This is one of the best books I have ever read!"
3,It ok,Hard to tell which side is the right side to print on. Some pictures come out really nice and some not so nice. The thickness of the paper is good.
1,looks just like a piece of cardboard,"I thought that this paper would be similar to the matte finish at local photo places, but it looks and prints just like a piece of cardboard. Very disappointed"
3,okay,"when i think matte i think professional pictures, but that is not what this is at all. it is a very dull photo paper."
5,Great photo paper,"This matte photo paper works very nicely with both my Canon printers, a pixma 4000 and 6000. I prefer it to glossy paper in most cases."
4,"Need 8"" x 12"" Photo Paper?","We use this paper cut down for 8"" x 12"" Digital SLR Camera prints. The paper is exactly as advertised. Too bad no one seems to think there is a home market for medium to large photo papers matting and frames in 3:2 aspect ratio."
2,"Canon Photo Paper Matte, 4 x 6inches","Unfortunately, I picked the wrong size paper when I ordered this. Not sure if I will ever use this paper, but I might."
1,This is photo paper?????,"Definitely not what I had expected, this is nothing but glorified printer paper. I used it to print out 2 different photos, what a waste of ink. I then switched to the HP Photo Paper and the images were definitely clearer and sharper. Also, they ""felt"" more like a photo instead of a normal thin sheet of of printer paper with a dull image printed on it. I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Beautiful colors reproduction,"If you're expecting the somewhat shinny matte paper that you get from photo shops, don't buy this one (buy Ilford Premium Pearl Photo instead). I was disappointed when I first openned the package to find ""regular"" paper. The paper has a brighter white and a little more weight than regular printer paper. Having said that, this paper produces beautiful warm skin tone and brilliant white compared to the Canon Glossy II [which seems to have a greenish tint when compared side by side]. Love the fact that I don't have to worry about finger print. The only negative thing I can say about the image quality is that pictures appear to be overall darker than the glossy paper [especially in the shaded area]. Give this paper a try if you can get over the feeling of being ripped off b/c it feels like regular paper. Better yet, give Ilford Premium Pearl Photo paper a try and you won't be disappointed."
3,"Has the 4""x6"" glossy just set my expectations too high?","Being a fan of both matte finish paper (in film-to-print type photos) and Canon's 4""x6"" glossy, I was very happy to see this item. The first thing I noticed was that it was of a noticeably lighter weight than the 4""x6"" glossy. Okay, so no fun-with-two-sided-tape, but most people don't use photos as virtual wallpaper, so I'm thinking that the weight isn't much of a problem for most people. I mean, once you put the photo in a frame, you are not going to be able to tell how sturdy it feels.More importantly, the prints produced seem more akin to resume paper printouts than photographs. This surprised me after falling completely in love with both my Canon printer and the other non-pro Canon photo paper offering.My (unsolicited) suggestion? Go with the 8""x10"" glossy pro paper. It's only a couple of dollars more and, yes, I know, not matte, but if someone stuck a piece of white bond paper in my pack of this stuff, I may never know the difference."
1,Pictures fade over time,"I have a Canon MP390 which makes quality prints.When I bought the printer, I also purchased both HP and Canon Picture papers to see which were better.I was very happy with both brands until I found that after 9 months or so, the Canon pictures have faded badly, while the HP paper is still looking like the day I printed them.I am VERY happy with my Canon printer, and my Canon Powershot cameras, but the paper does not hold up over time.Just a heads up."
1,If your looking for PHOTO PAPER don't buy this!!!!,"I was so excited to see how inexpensive this paper was when looking for some photo paper to print some extra photos from my wedding (outside of the ones ordered from the photographer). I obviously wasn't expecting it to be EXACTLY like the professional prints but the results I got from this paper were TERRIBLE. The box says ""Now great for Arts and Crafts!"" Makes sense, cause this paper is just cardstock/posterboard. I definitely wont be buying this again!!!!!"
2,Not For Photo Printing,"This paper is only good for printing invitations or test pictures. It feels flimsy and the pictures quality is poor. It is like using good quality letter paper for pictures. I have used other photo paper (Epson & Kodak) which have been far superior and would recommend if you want beautiful quality, long lasting pics. Buy this only if you want a quick post card, invitation, cheap holiday pictures, etc."
4,Good book,"While his mother's cancer progresses, the narrator in this book flashes back to his childhood when his mother explained that God was the sun, an epiphany that becomes more tangible as he wrestles with impending death. Readers who don't expect haute literature will be touched by this tearjerker story that offers tenderness and comfort. It's also an excellent book to give to those who are open to afterlife discussions and/or are grieving the loss of a loved one. I also highly recommend ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
1,Not so good,"I do not like to cut down anything this person does. He has changed my life. But if your looking for real answers, this book does not give it. There are a lot better stories to read. I am not so interested in his stories. I want to know about his REAL life and what he does NOW. The book came off as boring, it spoke ""down"" to the readers, and it did not offer much insight into the other side. Please don't read it thinking it will. It is just a little ""cute"" story. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't the best thing I've ever read, either."
2,Let's get realistic,"I was very dissappointed in this book. John takes a character and surrounds him with family members who are oozing love, affection and support. He tries to teach us about our spirit and what life is about and how one man can learn through the experience of his wonderful family, the answers to the questions we all think about. How easy. The transition the character had to go through to discover the meaning of life was basically a light sneeze. I'd like to see John write a book where you don't have Grandma Rosie holding your hand and Mommy waiting for you to wake up to smother you with kisses. Most readers our looking for answers to Life's questions and look to these books for meaning because they do not have the Callaghan family at their every beckon to reassure them and give them a pillow of comfort about life. Try giving us a character that did not growing up in a fairytale family. This book did not hit the spot."
3,TITLE is INCORRECT ENGLISH!,"I like John Edward and don't mean to be nit-picky here, BUT... the TITLE is INCORRECT ENGLISH! It should be: 'What if God WAS the sun'. God is singular!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I was expecting a book similar to ""One Last Time""; however, as I was reading this I kept waiting for the connection with John's real life. I saw some parallels with his mother being diagnosed with cancer and thought somehow this would tie in to the story. Honestly, I was disappointed. But this is why it is a NOVEL. All in all, it was good. . . . but I was expecting OUT OF THIS WORLD! I can't wait to read his next book!"
5,Awesome,This was the most beautiful book I have ever read. I could not put this book down. I read it in one day and cried my eyes out. Not a sad cry a happy and mystical cry. It was great.
2,Caution: Major dieuretic,"Celery Seed is recommended for gout attacks, as such I thought I'd start taking it proactivelyUnfortunately the day I took it I had not had much to drink that morning and this dieuretic is so powerfull that I had major kidney pains through the day until I started drinking far more water than I usually take in.Needless to say I don't take it daily anymore, but I will keep it on hand for whenever I need to ""flush"" my system during a gout flare up (just make sure to drink more than ample water!)"
5,You go girl!,"Don't you just hate that term? Well, I do too, but it applies to this book, in the sense that that is what you find yourself saying over and over again as you read. A non stop, can't put it down great read! I warn you, don't start this book unless you have the time to devote to doing just that. If you don't set the time aside, you will go crazy with suspense!"
